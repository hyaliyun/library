They primarily live in northwest Panama in the Bocas del Toro Province. There are roughly 3,500 people who belong to the Naso tribe. It is one of the few Native American indigenous groups or tribes that continues to have a monarchy. History The Naso (Teribe or T√©rraba) people have traditionally occupied the mountainous jungle regions of western Bocas del Toro where they continue to identify with the lands along the river that became known in the Spanish speaking world as the Teribe or Tj√´r Di in Naso. ‚ÄòDi‚Äô means ‚Äòwater‚Äô and 'Tj√´r' is their mythical ‚ÄúGrand-Mother‚Äù who was endowed by God with the secrets of botanical medicine.Instituto de Estudios de las Tradiciones Sagradas de Abia Yala, I. 2001. Narraciones Teribes: Nasoga Laiw√£k. Vol. 7. Textos Sagrados. San Jos√©, C.R.: Fundaci√≥n Coordinadora de Pastoral Aborigen. Until as recently as three or four generations ago the Naso people led a remarkably autonomous existence. Dispersed among their clans and homesteads, and geographically isolated from most of the world, the Naso developed and nurtured their cultural self-sufficiency through the idiom and the institution of the family.Paiement 2009: 18 Overview The T√©rraba, or Teribe, are an indigenous group in the Puntarenas region of southern Costa Rica with a rich cultural heritage. Located on approximately 34.7 square miles (9,000 hectares) along the T√©rraba River, the T√©rraba have survived off the land for more than 500 years. The river called Grande de T√©rraba is the largest river in Costa Rica, in the province of Puntarenas, also known as River ‚ÄúDiqu√≠s‚Äù that in their native dialect means ‚Äúgreat water.‚Äù A significant part of the T√©rraba nation is living along the shores of the said river. The T√©rraba are a warrior people that trace its roots back to the pre-Columbian Chiriqu√≠ civilization that dominated Costa Rica. The T√©rraba have a deeply spiritual relationship with the land and, especially, water. When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the early 1500s, they found Costa Rica to be a harsh country with few resources to exploit. In comparison to other pre-colonial civilizations, there were few indigenous to use for labor. The Spanish brought Catholicism and smallpox, and many tribes were not able to survive both. Despite Spanish influence, the T√©rraba can trace their history back to specific events as early as the 1600s. The T√©rraba were able to maintain their culture, traditions and language in spite of the Spanish occupation and Catholic influence. They have recorded an extensive oral history to preserve it for future generations. Language The traditional language, Teribe, is only spoken by a handful of people in the community. However, the efforts to recover it are supported by the Teribe of Panama, another group that shares its culture and history with the T√©rraba of Costa Rica. The Panamanian community has been able to entirely maintain the native language, and has assisted the smaller Costa Rican community by sending a professor to the area to help teach the language. Historians cannot tell why and how those native tribes visited Cocos Island. However, Heyerdahl (1966) and Lines (1940) support the old statement of (Gonzalo Fernandez de) Oviedo regarding such early visits. (See more under Timeline.) The work of Arroyo (1966) is probably the best linguistic work and dictionary of the T√©rraba language but more recent publications may exist. For a short bibliography on the T√©rraba language please refer to The Newberry Library‚Äôs Indian Linguistics in the Edward E. Ayer collection, Volume 2. Timeline 1610 The T√©rraba participated with the indigenous groups Ateos, Viceitas and Cabecares in the rebellion that destroyed Santiago of Salamanca. The Spaniards wrote of Cocos Island, ‚ÄúAll√≠ se hallaron ciertos √≠dolos labrados de piedra‚Äù.Oviedo, 1959: 97 Lines (1940) claimed the same. That is, ‚Äúcertain idols were found there [on Cocos Island], worked out of stone.‚Äù This indicates the visits of some native tribes before (or at the beginning of the) colonial era. The archaeological findings in Heyerdahl (1966) confirm that the Galapagos Islands, at about the same distance from the continent, had similar visits by South American Indians. It is possible that the temporary homeland or a base port of one of the tribes was on Galapagos Islands in those decades. There is no detailed data about the T√©rraba before the year 1697. They numbered between 500 and 2000 persons then. Their men were described as being naked and distinct from other Costa Rican tribes by their fame as diligent workers. Their mortal enemies were the Changuenes that were mentioned in Spanish documents at least from 1680, as living on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. In 1708-1709 the T√©rrabas also lived on the coast at Diquis, later called ‚ÄúGrande de T√©rraba.‚Äù They became very faithful Christians.Mel√©ndez, 1978: 132-135 1710 Missionaries led by Fray Pablo de Rebullida and the Spanish military moved part of the T√©rraba population to the southwestern region of Costa Rica, near Boruca and the T√©rraba River. The town, San Francisco de T√©rraba, was founded in 1689. Its name was later shortened to T√©rraba. 1761 The northern Indians attacked San Francisco de T√©rraba, burning it, killing the men and capturing the women, a day after an attack on Cabagra, another local indigenous group. After the massacre, T√©rraba only had 300 people left. 1845-1848 After a church was burned, the Catholic priests decided that reducing the territory would conserve and protect the population. Within several years Pauline priests arrived to take over the T√©rraba community, but brought smallpox. The epidemic decimated the population. 1956-1977 Legislation to establish and protect the indigenous territories gave the T√©rraba the inalienable right to their traditional land, the use of their resources and some autonomy in self- governance. 1970s Costa Rica began promoting clearing forests to convert them to agricultural and pastoral lands. Much of the T√©rraba‚Äôs forest was lost. 1982 The T√©rraba lost the right to own the minerals beneath the soil on their own land, under a new mining law. 1999 Costa Rica recognized indigenous languages in its constitution. 2002 Indigenous communities began protesting against the Diqu√≠s Hydroelectric Project, which was then known as the Boruca Hydroelectric Project. 2004 The title to the territory was amended and reduced without asking the T√©rraba, fragmenting the territory into blocks. 2007 Diqu√≠s project workers moved to the region and started work without consulting the T√©rraba community. 2009 On Oct. 6, more than 150 T√©rraba and others marched along the inter-American highway to demand respect for their right to participate in decisions involving their lands. They marched all the way to the town of Buenos Aires, more than 8 miles (13 kilometers) from T√©rraba territory. ICE employees filmed and shouted at them in Buenos Aires, causing a confrontation that required police intervention. 2011 The Costa Rican Electricity Institute (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad ‚Äì ICE) removed their equipment and suspended work in T√©rraba territory. Economy The Naso, who now live in the province of Bocas del Toro, Panama, are for the most part very poor subsistence farmers who supplement their earnings with the sale of the agricultural products (cocoa, oranges, plantains, etc.), animals (pigs, chickens, ducks, etc.), lumber (Cordia alliodora, Cedrela odorata, etc.) and some handicrafts which they transport to the relatively nearby city of Changuinola (population 30,000, two hours down river by raft or dugout canoe). While the Naso are isolated in geographic terms and receive few visitors to their communities, they are for the most part bilingual (Naso and Spanish), wear Western clothing, and many among them have converted to evangelical Protestant religions.Paiement 2009: 19-20 The Costa Rica branch has been successful in gaining United Nations financial support to build tourism facilities including hostel/cabin housing with plumbing and improvement to trails.iMedia, Elon TourTerraba Lands The enormous scientific, hydroelectric and eco-tourism potential of the Naso people‚Äôs ancestral territory has attracted considerable international and national interest. Beginning in the 1980s the Government of Panama transferred large sections of the region to its own system of protected areas (Palo Seco National Forest (BBPS) and La Amistad International Park (PILA). In the year 2005, three major conservation and development projects were proposing to significantly reorganize local land use activities. These included a new law to recognize Naso territorial rights and jurisdiction in the Panamanian National Assembly, a World Bank-funded Biological Corridor project (CBMAP) promoting sustainable development in indigenous communities and protected areas, and a hydroelectric project sponsored by a Colombian utility company (Empresas P√∫blicas de Medell√≠n).Paiement 2009: 20-21 In Costa Rica, T√©rraba lands are threatened by the Diqu√≠s Dam project, which would flood 10 percent of the land including important sacred sites and which would force the relocation of the approximately 600 indigenous Naso who live in the country. Politics The tribe is governed by a king. The succession, according to tradition, would follow from the king to his brother, to the older son of the previous king. Since the 1980s, succession is based on the vote of the adult population. Typically, when there is a sense within the community that there is dissatisfaction with the current king (or sometimes queen, for instance queen Rufina), another member of the royal family may choose to stand for a public vote to see if they can replace the current king. In 2004 King Tito was deposed following his approval of a hydro electric scheme on the Bonyic River which traverses Naso territory. He was deposed in a civil uprising in the capital - Siey Llik - and forced into exile. His uncle is now considered the King of Naso by the majority of the tribe, although this state of affairs is yet to be recognized by the Panamanian Government. =List of Kings= * Bass Lee Santana * Santiago Santana * Santiago Santana (son) * Chalee Santana * Francisco Santana * L√°zaro Santana - (? - 1973) * Sime√≥n Santana - (1973‚Äì1979) * Manuel Aguilar - (1979 - April 25, 1982) * Rufina Santana - (April 25, 1982 - July 30, 1988) * C√©sar Santana - (July 30, 1988 - May 31, 1998) * Tito Santana - (May 31, 1998- ) **Valent√≠n Santana - (May 30, 2004- )On May 30, 2004, Tito lost a vote of confidence, but still claims the title of king. Culture The T√©rraba describe themselves as a matriarchal community. They pride themselves on their rich agriculture and their independence. Most of the inhabitants in Panama speak the native language, although the majority also know Spanish. Very few of the Naso tribes adhere to Roman Catholicism. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, is very important. The traditional God is Sib√∂, who is a supreme God and creator. Most Naso live in elevated wooden houses, with thatched or zinc-coated roofing. In Costa Rica, few native speakers remain, mostly elders. Intermarriage between the Costa Rica and Panama groups has brought some fluent speakers to live in the Costa Rica territories. As of 2012, the community in Costa Rica has brought in a teacher from Panama to reintroduce the language in the village schools.

The jasper conglomerate occurs on St. Joseph Island and the St. Mary's River area north and northwest of the Bruce Mines of Northern Ontario, about east of Sault Ste. Marie. This conglomerate consisted originally of gravelly sands and sandy gravels composed of subrounded pebbles of red jasper, white quartzite, semi-transparent quartz, and black chert, with coarse-grained sand matrix. Typically it contains between about 30% to as much as 90% pebbles. It has been cemented and partially metamorphosed into a quartzitic conglomerate.

The name of the station derives from its past as the main station serving trains towards Gda≈Ñsk. Currently, trains in that direction use the main Cross-City Line and the Warszawa Centralna railway station. It is located on the \\"Northern Line\\" that runs between Central Warsaw and the city's ≈ªoliborz district to the north. It serves as a transportation hub for regional trains departing the station. It connects with the Warsaw Metro's Dworzec Gda≈Ñski stop, located below the railway station, and a number of nearby tram and bus stops. The Warsaw Metro has received EU funding to build a pedestrian tunnel linking the metro station to the railway station. The railway station is located some 3.5 km north of the main rail line crossing the city linking Warszawa Wschodnia, Warszawa Centralna and Warszawa Zachodnia railway stations and as such is sometimes used as a reserve station, used by trains during track works on the main line, but that is quite rare, as there are two tracks in each direction on the main line. Currently (2011), it is used exclusively by Koleje Mazowieckie for services KM9 to/from Ciechan√≥w and Dzia≈Çdowo via Legionowo, Modlin, Nasielsk, where the train changes number, M≈Çawa (only for trains continue to Dzia≈Çdowo, from/to starting/terminating at Warszawa Wola). Trains continuing to Dzia≈Çdowo, wait in Ciechan√≥w for 50 minutes. Some trains terminate at Legionowo and Modlin.  History Station building in 1877 Gdanska railroad station looking toward the Warsaw Ghetto Uprsing in 1943 Warszawa Gda≈Ñska platforms, view to the west. March 2012 The original station was built around 1880 under the name of Vistulan Main Train Station () and served a local line running along the Vistula river northwards. In the early 20th century, with the opening of a railway bridge over the river south of Warsaw Citadel (directly to the east of the station; the bridge was constructed around 1870, but was initially used by the Russian Army exclusively), it was renamed Warszawa Kowelska (Warsaw Kovel train station) and started serving as a junction between the Warsaw G≈Ç√≥wna and Warszawa Wile≈Ñska stations. Until then the passengers travelling from St. Petersburg to Vienna had to leave the train station at Warszawa Wile≈Ñska, take a tram to the city centre and take another train of the European standard gauge (1435 mm) on the Warsaw-Vienna railway. The Warsaw Kovel station also served as the main supply station for the Russian garrison stationed in the Warsaw Citadel. During the withdrawal of Russian troops from Warsaw in August 1915, the station was demolished, along with the bridge to which it led. After World War I both were rebuilt, and the station was renamed Warszawa Gda≈Ñska (Warsaw Gda≈Ñsk station), named after the city of Gda≈Ñsk. After 1933, with the opening of the cross-city line, linking three main Warsaw train stations, the Warsaw Gda≈Ñsk station lost its importance as a transit station and began serving as a station for local and suburban trains. After 1942, the western part (adjacent to the Warsaw Ghetto) of the freight station had been adapted to become the Umschlagplatz (collection point) ‚Äî the deportation facility for Warsaw's Jews. After World War II, due to the complete destruction of many Warsaw's railway stations, Warsaw Gda≈Ñsk was used as a temporary station for long-distance trains, including, until the 1970s, trains passing through Warsaw between the USSR and the west. Among the notable trains to stop there was the Ost-West Express from Moscow to Ostend, Hoek van Holland and Paris; the Chopin to Vienna; and the Praha to Prague trains. As such, it was the main location through which people expelled in the aftermath of the Polish 1968 political crisis left Poland. The events of 1968 are now commemorated by a stone tablet on the eastern wall of the building with the inscription by Henryk Grynberg Here they left more than they had. Between 1958-1959 the new building of the station was constructed. It was the first station built in Warsaw after World War II, and it was at the time the most modern station in Warsaw. The building stood until 1984, when it was destroyed in a fire. The station was rebuilt in a few years with some changes - a new story was added. In the 1970s, the station's long-distance services were completely taken over by the newly built Warszawa Centralna, and Warszawa Gda≈Ñska became a minor station for suburban trains.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington Nationals, Seattle Mariners, and Colorado Rockies. Beimel was known for his exceptional slider pitch and high change which kept hitters guessing at the plate. He is also the only MLB player to ever wear the number 97. Amateur career Beimel attended St. Marys Area High School and was a letterman in football, wrestling, basketball, and baseball. He played two seasons of junior college baseball at Allegany College of Maryland in Cumberland, Maryland and one season at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. Six former Allegany College players have made it to Major League Baseball. Beimel was the fifth Major League Baseball player to come out of the Allegany College of Maryland program. The five other Allegany Trojans to make the big leagues were John Kruk, Stan Belinda, Steve Kline, Scott Seabol and Scott Patterson. At Allegany, Beimel played for Junior College Hall of Fame Coach Steve Bazarnic. During Beimel's years at Allegany the Trojans advanced to the Junior College World Series both seasons. At Duquesne University he was the team leader in wins and complete games and was second on the staff in strikeouts and ERA.OnTheBluff.com - Joe Beimel Named To DU Hall Of Fame Professional career =Pittsburgh Pirates= He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 26th round after his freshman year in college but chose to remain in school. He was later selected in the 18th round of the 1998 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates after his junior year and signed with the Pirates on June 5, 1998. He is the first pitcher drafted by the Pirates out of the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne University; he is the only pitcher to have made it to the Major Leagues. His minor league stops in the Pirates organization included their development level team in Erie (1998, 1-4, 6.32, 6 starts), their \\"A\\" ball team in Hickory (1999, 5-11, 4.43, 22 starts), their \\"A+\\" team in Lynchburg (2000, 10-6, 3.36, 18 starts, 2 CGs), and their \\"AA\\" team in Altoona (1-6, 4.16, 10 starts, 1 CG). After a strong spring, he made the Pirates Major League roster at the start of the 2001 season. He made his major league debut as the starting pitcher on April 8, 2001 against the Houston Astros, pitching 5 innings, allowing 2 runs, and recording his first career victory. He appeared as both a starter and a reliever that season, finishing with a record of 7‚Äì11, ERA of 5.23 in 42 appearances, 15 of them as a starter. He made another 8 starts on the 2002 squad but has been primarily used as a relief pitcher ever since. After finishing both the 2002 & 2003 seasons in the Pirates bullpen as an average middle reliever, the Pirates released him right before the start of the 2004 season. =Minnesota Twins= He was subsequently signed as a free agent by the Minnesota Twins on April 11, 2004. He spent the bulk of the season with Minnesota's Class-AAA Minor League affiliate in Rochester, where he had a mediocre season (2-4, 6.97, in 49 appearances). He made just three relief appearances for the Twins as a September call-up and then was released after the season. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Beimel was signed as a free agent by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on November 5, 2004 and spent most of the 2005 season with their \\"AAA\\" team the Durham Bulls, rebounding by going 1-2 with a 3.93 era in 48 games. He made a few trips to the big leagues to pitch for the Devil Rays during the season, making 7 appearances with an era of 3.27. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 In 2006, he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers and became a valuable member of their relief corps, with a 2.96 era in 62 appearances, primarily as a late inning left-handed specialist. However, he has also been effective enough against right-handed batters to be used as both a set-up man and emergency closer, and proved remarkably effective when put into games to work the Dodgers out of jams. He wore #97 for the Dodgers, which at the time was the highest number ever used by a Dodger. The number represents the year of his first child's birth. His successful season ended on a down note; right before 2006 divisional series between the Dodgers and New York Mets began, Beimel cut his hand on glass at a bar in New York. Due to his injury Beimel was left off the series roster. At first he claimed that it happened in his hotel room before divulging the truth after the Dodgers lost to the Mets three games to none. Beimel was completely sober for 15 months following the incident and now drinks only occasionally. During the 2007 season, Beimel set a record for the Dodgers by making 83 appearances, the most by a left-handed pitcher in the Dodgers history. During his first two years with the Dodgers, Beimel became known for his ability to get Barry Bonds out. Beimel held Bonds to 1-16 at the plate, with the one hit being a solo home run. He also walked Bonds only three times. After the arrival of new manager Joe Torre, Beimel was forced to cut his hair, a situation similar to one Stump Merrill had with now-Dodger manager Don Mattingly when managing the New York Yankees. Relationship with fans Joe gained a cult following in 2008 in a series of fan-made YouTube videos. When the Dodgers conducted their second annual online fan vote during Spring Training to determine what player should be immortalized as part of the team's bobblehead promotions, Beimel took home the honors for 2008 after a strong Internet turnout, including a campaign that was orchestrated by his parents, Ron and Marge Beimel. Washington Nationals in 2009 =Washington Nationals= On March 18, 2009, Beimel and the Washington Nationals agreed to a one-year $2 million deal; he became their eighth-inning set up man.Nationals Reach Deal With Beimel ESPN, March 18, 2009 =Colorado Rockies= On July 31, 2009, Beimel was traded by the Nationals to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Mattheus and Robinson Fabian.Rockies acquire LHP Joe Beimel from Nationals He signed a minor league contract on March 22, 2010, and was brought up to the majors on April 15. His entrance song was \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" by Johnny Cash. =Return to Pittsburgh= On January 27, 2011, the Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to sign Beimel to a minor league contract. He began the season on the disabled list due to soreness in his forearm and elbow which he experienced midway through spring training. He spent the first weeks of season on rehab assignments with the Advance-A Bradenton Marauders and Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. The Pirates activated Beimel from the disabled list on April 15, 2011.Pirates activate pitcher Joe Beimel On May 28, 2011, Beimel was placed on the 15-day disabled list with the same injury which put him on the shelf to begin the season. Daniel Moskos was recalled to take his place. He was designated for assignment on August 23. On August 30 he was released. =Texas Rangers= Beimel in 2012 spring training with the Texas Rangers On February 6, 2012, Beimel signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. He was released on March 26. Beimel underwent Tommy John surgery on May 1, 2012. =Seattle Mariners= Beimel signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners on January 24, 2014. In his first appearance with Seattle, Beimel recorded an out without throwing a pitch, picking off David Freese from first base.

The school offered students an international education from Nursery to Year 13 (Kindergarten to grade 12). The school was divided into three phases : Infants (nursery and Key Stage 1), Junior / Middle School (Key Stage 2 and 3) and High School (Key Stages 4 and 5). The school followed the British Curriculum (See Education in England) to Year 11 where students took IGCSE; students in Senior High School undertook a university preparation programme. Students who successfully completed Year 13 (grade 12) were awarded with a High School Diploma.

Over six decades he transformed his small, local optical shop into a large-scale international enterprise, pioneering the American optical industry.  Early years  Bausch was born to Georg Bausch, a baker, and his wife Anna Schmid, in Gro√ü S√º√üen (today part of S√º√üen) in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. At the age of eighteen he moved to Bern, Switzerland, where he worked as a lens grinder in an optical shop designing camera lenses. In 1850 he emigrated to the United States. Upon his arrival, he made his way to a German community in Buffalo, New York, but because of a cholera epidemic there he settled in Rochester, New York, and Anglicized his name to John Jacob.  Business Development  In 1853, Bausch opened a retail optical shop in Rochester. Bausch sold spectacles, thermometers, field glasses, magnifiers and opera glasses. His friend Henry Lomb, also a German immigrant (from Burghaun, Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel), who had immigrated in 1849, invested his $60 in savings in Bausch's shop and in 1855, on a handshake, became his partner. By 1856 Bausch renamed the company the \\"Optical Institute of Rochester.\\" In the spring of 1861, Lomb enlisted and served in the American Civil War for two years. In Lomb's absence, Bausch accidentally made a fortuitous discovery: he found a piece of vulcanite rubber on a New York street. He took it home and experimented making eyeglass frames from the material. At that time wire frames were mainly made from gold, and horn-rimmed frames were made from either European deer horn or tortoise shell, so eyeglasses were considered an expensive luxury. Bausch realized he could make stronger and less expensive vulcanite eyeglass frames, but soon he struggled to keep up with demand. During the Civil War, the blockade caused the price of gold and European horn to rise dramatically. This resulted in a growing demand for the Bausch and Lomb spectacles made from vulcanite. In 1864 they renamed the company \\"Bausch and Lomb, Opticians,\\" and reorganized again as the \\"Vulcanite Optical Instrument Company\\" in 1866. They built the first machine in America to produce spectacles beginning in the early 1870s. Lomb was in charge of sales and finance, while Bausch concentrated on the manufacturing side of the business. The firm took yet another name in 1876, \\"Bausch and Lomb Optical Company,\\" and began manufacturing microscopes. Later that year they exhibited at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company also produced photographic lenses (1883), spectacle lenses (1889), microtomes (1890), binoculars and telescopes (1893). The firm was incorporated as \\"Bausch and Lomb Optical Company, Inc.,\\" in 1908, the year Bausch's long-time partner died. Bausch's company did very well during the First World War as the war created a demand for binocular telescopes, range-finders, gunsights, searchlight mirrors, periscopes and torpedo tube sights. The U.S. government became Bausch and Lomb's major customer as the company produced related optical instruments for the armed forces. One of their famous products was Ray-ban sunglasses, until they sold it to the Italian eyewear conglomerate Luxottica. Bausch led his company for more than six decades, and following his death in 1926, it continued to flourish under the leadership of his son Edward Bausch, remaining preeminent in its field. It was named to the Fortune 500 list of America's leading companies in 1975.

It is a g √ó g matrix where C has genus g. The rank of the Hasse‚ÄìWitt matrix is the Hasse or Hasse‚ÄìWitt invariant. Approach to the definition This definition, as given in the introduction, is natural in classical terms, and is due to Helmut Hasse and Ernst Witt (1936). It provides a solution to the question of the p-rank of the Jacobian variety J of C; the p-rank is bounded by the rank of H, specifically it is the rank of the Frobenius mapping composed with itself g times. It is also a definition that is in principle algorithmic. There has been substantial recent interest in this as of practical application to cryptography, in the case of C a hyperelliptic curve. The curve C is superspecial if H = 0. That definition needs a couple of caveats, at least. Firstly, there is a convention about Frobenius mappings, and under the modern understanding what is required for H is the transpose of Frobenius (see arithmetic and geometric Frobenius for more discussion). Secondly, the Frobenius mapping is not F-linear; it is linear over the prime field Z/pZ in F. Therefore the matrix can be written down but does not represent a linear mapping in the straightforward sense. Cohomology The interpretation for sheaf cohomology is this: the p-power map acts on :H1(C,OC), or in other words the first cohomology of C with coefficients in its structure sheaf. This is now called the Cartier‚ÄìManin operator (sometimes just Cartier operator), for Pierre Cartier and Yuri Manin. The connection with the Hasse‚ÄìWitt definition is by means of Serre duality, which for a curve relates that group to :H0(C, Œ©C) where Œ©C = Œ©1C is the sheaf of K√§hler differentials on C. Abelian varieties and their p-rank The p-rank of an abelian variety A over a field K of characteristic p is the integer k for which the kernel A[p] of multiplication by p has pk points. It may take any value from 0 to d, the dimension of A; by contrast for any other prime number l there are l2d points in A[l]. The reason that the p-rank is lower is that multiplication by p on A is an inseparable isogeny: the differential is p which is 0 in K. By looking at the kernel as a group scheme one can get the more complete structure (reference David Mumford Abelian Varieties pp. 146‚Äì7); but if for example one looks at reduction mod p of a division equation, the number of solutions must drop. The rank of the Cartier‚ÄìManin operator, or Hasse‚ÄìWitt matrix, therefore gives an upper bound for the p-rank. The p-rank is the rank of the Frobenius operator composed with itself g times. In the original paper of Hasse and Witt the problem is phrased in terms intrinsic to C, not relying on J. It is there a question of classifying the possible Artin‚ÄìSchreier extensions of the function field F(C) (the analogue in this case of Kummer theory). Case of genus 1 The case of elliptic curves was worked out by Hasse in 1934. Since the genus is 1, the only possibilities for the matrix H are: H is zero, Hasse invariant 0, p-rank 0, the supersingular case; or H non-zero, Hasse invariant 1, p-rank 1, the ordinary case. Here there is a congruence formula saying that H is congruent modulo p to the number N of points on C over F, at least when q = p. Because of Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves, knowing N modulo p determines N for p ‚â• 5. This connection with local zeta-functions has been investigated in depth. For a plane curve defined by a cubic f(X,Y,Z) = 0, the Hasse invariant is zero if and only if the coefficient of (XYZ)p‚àí1 in fp‚àí1 is zero.

Dating from 1596, it is housed in the Capodimonte Gallery of Naples. The subject is the Choice of Hercules. Carracci, who was in Rome from the late 1595 or early 1596, was commissioned this work by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese for the ceiling of his camerino in his family's palace. In 1662 it was moved to the Farnese ducal seat in Parma. The work is considered one of Carracci's masterworks for its balanced rendering of a poetical ideal, graphically influenced by the artist's contact with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes and Rome's classical remains, such as the Farnese Hercules or the Laoco√∂n group. A vigorous and plastic Hercules is depicted with two women flanking him, who represent the opposite destinies which life could reserve him: on the left Virtue is calling him to the hardest path leading to glory through hardship, while the second, a woman with worldly pleasures, the easier path, is enticing him to vice. Behind Hercules is a palm, which, through the leaves and the branches (a symbol of military victory and fame), hints to Hercules' future heroic life. At the top of the hardest path is Hercules reward, Pegasus.

It is represented by two species, Pronycticebus gaudryi and Pronycticebus neglectus, of which an almost complete specimen was found in Germany. Morphology Pronycticebus neglectus possessed what appears to be a grooming claw on the second digit of each foot like modern strepsirhines (Fleagle, 1999) and had a dental formula of 2:1:4:3. Pronycticebus neglectus has a petrosal bulla and a postorbital bar. Pronycticebus neglectus may have been a nocturnal or a crepuscular species, which is suggested by a relatively large orbital size. Pronycticebus neglectus has a relatively large baculum for a species of its size, which had an average body mass of 825 grams. Range Pronycticebus neglectus lived in Europe.

Anas Altikriti himself is a hostage negotiator, who has successfully negotiated the release of 18 hostages from various conflict zones around the world, between November 2005 and October 2015. The Cordoba Foundation has been criticized for its links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. In 2009 David Cameron, then leader of the opposition, made a statement during a Parliamentary Prime Ministers Questions, in which he alleged that TCF was a front for the Muslim Brotherhood. In late 2014 The Cordoba Foundation was listed as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates, along with the more than 75 various other international Muslim organisations which operate in a variety of fields. The British government opened its own enquiry into the Muslim Brotherhood. After a long delay, the report concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood should not be classified as a terrorist organization in the UK.  Early life  Anas Altikriti was born into a Muslim family; his father Dr Osama Tawfiq Altikriti is a retired Consultant Radiologist who attained his Fellowship in Radiology from London in 1978. An opposition figure to the Ba'th regime which came to power in Iraq in 1968, he eventually came to head the Muslim Brotherhood in Iraq for a number of years until the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 at the hands of the US led invasion.:ar:ÿ£ÿ≥ÿßŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÉÿ±Ÿäÿ™Ÿä In 2003, he retired from medicine and moved back to Iraq and served for 2 terms as a member of the Iraqi Council of Representatives on behalf of the Iraqi Islamic Party.  Professional activities  Anas Altikriti holds an MSc in Translation and Interpreting. He teaches translation and interpreting on part-time basis at Leeds University. Anas Altikriti became involved with the UK's Stop the War Coalition protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, becoming the movement's vice-president. He headed the Respect Party Yorkshire and the Humber slate for the European elections in 2004. Altikriti also served as president of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) between 2004 and 2005.Anas Altikriti Profile The Guardian The MAB was \\"elevated from a relatively obscure group to national prominence\\" due to its association with the Stop the War coalition. After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Altikriti found himself increasingly at odds with the MAB, many of whose members wanted a retreat from activism including involvement in the Stop the War Coalition in favor of educational/community development programmes. By December that year, Altikriti together with Azzam Tamimi had effectively lost control of MAB policy; in response, Altikriti helped form the British Muslim Initiative to maintain high-level political activism.  Media appearances  As a commentator in the International and Arab media (including BBC, CNN, ABC, SKY and Al-Jazeera) on Muslim and current affairs, he has appeared on HARDtalk and the Doha Debates (both with Tim Sebastian), Lateline on Australian ABC and BBC's Newsnight as well as a number of prominent programs on a variety of international channels. Altikriti has contributed a number of articles to The Guardian, Al-Ahram Weekly and Islam Online. He currently fronts a weekly debate show Sharqun Wa Gharb (East and West) on the Arab TV satellite station 'Al-Hiwar' (The Dialogue). In late 2005 and 2006 he made a number of trips to Iraq in efforts to release British hostage Norman Kember, who was eventually released in March 2006 by UK special forces. = Support for Syrian opposition = A supporter of the Arab Spring which spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa in the final days of 2010 and throughout the subsequent 3 years, Altikriti has been a consistent supporter of the Syrian revolution since it broke out in February 2011. Although consistently calling for the fall and legal prosecution of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, Anas Altikriti has opposed Western military intervention as well as the meddling of Iran and its regional proxies in propping the regime in Damascus. Of late, he has declared his condemnation of the Russian military intervention in Syria. His efforts in supporting the Syrian people focused on the emergency relief, education and health sectors, while offering strategic training and media advice to various factions of the Syrian political opposition entities. Despite numerous invitations, Altikriti has refused to meet with or cooperate with any of the opposition military or armed factions. = Relationship with Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas = Altikriti has been a vocal supporter of the policies of Muslim Brotherhood parties across the Middle East and has been described as one of the shrewdest UK-based Brotherhood activists. In 2009, David Cameron, then leader of the opposition, made a statement during a Parliamentary Prime Ministers Questions, in which he alleged that TCF was a front for the Muslim Brotherhood. Despite this reputation, Altikriti states that he is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Anas Altikriti's father Osama Tawfiq al-Tikriti currently heads the Iraqi Islamic Party, the largest Sunni Islamist political party in Iraq which evolved from the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Al- Tikriti: > \\"'I was asked at a recent meeting with some of Washington‚Äôs wheelers and > dealers about what the American government should do with the Islamic > movements gaining prominence and claiming the limelight across the Arab > world, I answered simply: support them ‚Ä¶ unless we encourage them and offer > them an incentive, their own crop of hard-liners will have been proven > right\\". This has been interpreted as a new iteration of Altikriti's previous lobbying strategy, which has sought to persuade Western governments that they should fund Brotherhood groups as moderate alternatives to al-Qaeda. Altikriti has been accused of using the Arab Spring as a new opportunity to leverage the Muslim Brotherhood into positions of power and influence, and perhaps even to acquire new funds from Western sources, through arguing that Western support for the Muslim Brotherhood parties can undermine and moderate more extremist Islamist elements. The Cordoba Foundation and British Muslim Initiative (BMI) have been criticized by Andrew Gilligan in The Telegraph for working \\"closely with other British extremist groups which seek the creation of an Islamic dictatorship, or caliphate, in Europe\\", referring to the Emirates Centre for Human Rights.Andrew Gilligan Terror-link group met in parliament, Daily Telegraph, 23 November 2013 Gilligan stated that Altikriti has close ties to Hamas leadership and co-founded BMI with a senior commander in Hamas, Mohammed Sawalha, and a Hamas \\"special envoy\\", Azzam Tamimi. A spokesperson from the Emirates Centre for Human Rights stated that \\"Anas Altikriti helped set up the Emirates Centre for Human Rights, but now has nothing to do with it.\\" Altikriti has stated that \\"the Brotherhood supports Hamas. I believe that if you are occupied you need to fight back.\\" The UK govt. considers the military wing but not the political wing of Hamas to be a terrorist organization. In late 2014 The Cordoba Foundation was listed as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates, along with the more than 75 various other international Muslim organisations which operate in a variety of fields. The British government opened its own enquiry into the Muslim Brotherhood. After a long delay, the report concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood should not be classified as a terrorist organization in the UK.  Closure of bank accounts  Altikriti's UK bank accounts were closed by HSBC in August 2014 along with those of a number of Muslim organizations, including the Cordoba Foundation. According to the BBC, \\"the bank said it was applying a programme of strategic assessments to all of its businesses after a $1.9bn fine in 2012 over poor money- laundering controls.\\" The only reason given for closure was: \\"the provision of banking service ... now falls outside of our risk appetite\\". The Charity Commission stated that it was not investigating any of the Muslim organizations with whom HSBC terminated its relationship.

The original music score was composed by Maurice Jarre. Plot Louie Jeffries, a young district attorney, is hit by a car and dies in 1964, but manages to slip by the pearly gates and is instantly reborn. In 1987, 23 years later, his widow Corinne still misses him, ignoring the frustrated devotion of his best friend Phillip Train, who has pretty much raised Louie's only daughter Miranda as his own. Miranda, while a student at Yale University, meets Alex Finch, who works in the library but is about to graduate. After graduation, Alex heads to Washington, D.C., where he makes his way to the offices of The Washington Post. His first attempts to meet with Ben Bradlee thwarted, Alex schemes his way into Bradlee's office by pretending to be a delivery man. Alex walks into Bradlee's office, with Phillip behind him. Confounded by the young man, Bradlee asks who Alex is. When Alex attempts to remind him of their meeting at Yale, Phillip vouches for him, which changes Bradlee's mind about giving him a meeting. Unfortunately, Bradlee feels Alex needs more time working on smaller papers before he can offer him a job. Feeling defeated, Alex leaves his office. Phillip finds Alex downstairs in the lobby. Alex offers Phillip a ride, during which Phillip invites Alex to meet the Jeffries family over dinner. While at the Jeffries home, which he'd never previously been to, Alex begins to have flashbacks of a previous life. Freaked out, he begins to act crazed and confused. Putting the pieces together, Alex realizes he is Louie Jeffries, Corinne's dead husband, reincarnated. Miranda, wanting to continue the flirtation that started when they met, is confused when Alex rebuffs her. Alex tries to convince Corrine that he's Louie. At first she doesn't believe him, but he knows things only Louie would know. She finally gives in and they kiss. They take a trip together away from town, and Corrine is a little disturbed when people think Alex is her son. Louie/Alex wants to make love, but Corrine reveals she hasn't had sex since Louie died. One night when Louie and Corrine are together, they're caught by Phillip, who accuses Alex of being a gold digger. Louie/Alex then reminds Phillip he declared his love for Corinne to Louie on their wedding day. Phillip is confused and tries to punch Louie/Alex but Louie/Alex punches him instead, knocking him out. Corinne rushes to Phillip's side, and yells at Louie to get out of the room. Louie realizes then that she loves Phillip too. Corrine slips a note under Louie/Alex's door, saying she's sorry, and she'll visit him later. Louie/Alex puts Phillip in his bed, so that when Corinne arrives, thinking he's Louie, she accidentally kisses Phillip. He's ecstatic, and Corinne realizes she loves him too. They make love. Louie/Alex spends the night in his car. The next day, he bursts into a courtroom accusing a judge of accepting a bribe (Louie remembers taking a photograph of the then younger judge taking the bribe). Phillip, who's also in the courtroom, realizes only Louie would know about that fact, and now believes Alex is Louie. He tells Phillip about the location of the camera with the pictures of the judge taking a bribe. Alex falls down the stairs, hits his head, and ends up in the hospital. While unconscious, an angel visits Alex, and gives him the special \\"shot\\" he should have gotten 23 years previous, to forget his past life as Louie. When Alex wakes, he's forgotten about being Louie, and he tells Miranda that the last thing he remembers is their kissing in the corner of the refrigerator. Newspaper headlines show the judge charged with accepting the bribe. Alex accepts a job offer as a reporter. Corinne and Phillip get married, and at their wedding, Alex tells Phillip he's in love with Miranda.

It has of park, farmland, and gardens, with more than thirty listed buildings, surrounded by a wall which is long. \\"Y Faenol\\" means \\"the manor\\" and is a mutated form of the Welsh word maenol. The buildings on the estate include two Grade I listed halls: Faenol Old Hall, much of which dates from the Williams' period of ownership, and Vaynol Hall, built in 1793 and extended during the 19th century. Once Vaynol Hall was built, Faenol Old Hall became a farmhouse and subsequently deteriorated; in 2003 it appeared on the BBC's Restoration programme, championed by Robert Hardy. In 2009, the BBC revisited the project, and said that Faenol Hall was now \\"in private ownership and has been restored\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/restoration/seriesone.shtml There is also a Grade I listed chapel and a very old barn on the site. The Vaynol estate should not be confused with the neighbouring National Trust land called Glan Faenol. History Faenol Old Hall The estate's origins are in the 16th century, when the bishops of Bangor sold property belonging to their manor, Maenol Bangor.Dinorwic by Reg Chambers Jones, Bridge Books, 2006. The estate was developed during that century by the Williams family. It passed to the Crown on the death without issue of Sir William Williams in 1696. In 1723 it was presented to John Smith of Tedworth, Wiltshire, and in 1762 passed to his nephew Thomas Assheton Smith I (1752‚Äì1828). Assheton Smith was later MP for Caernarvonshire and then Andover, and his son, also Thomas (1776‚Äì1858) sat for the same constituencies but was known as a cricketer, Master of Foxhounds and owner of steam yachts. Assheton Smith I was the 3rd largest landowner in Gwynedd. This area of Wales is known for its slate production, and the Assheton Smiths profited from slate quarrying as owners of the Dinorwic Quarry, which made a profit of ¬£30,000 in 1856 (). Even after farms were let on long leases to encourage good tenant behaviour, slate remained the family's main economic interest. The Assheton Smiths extended their estate through enclosure, despite strong opposition from local farmers, including the enclosure of existing properties at Gallt-y-foel. The Assheton Smiths remained in possession of the estate until the 20th century. In 1847, it passed to Mary Astley, niece of Thomas Assheton Smith of Vaynol, who married Robert George Duff, a distant cousin of the Earls of Fife. Vaynol passed in turn to their two eldest sons (the first of whom, George William (1848-1904 Obituary Carnarvon & Denbigh Herald 25 November 1904Will Carnarvon & Denbigh Herald 16 December 1904), left no son; his wife and daughter had Snowdon Mountain Railway locomotives named after them Johnson, Peter; An Illustrated History of the Snowdon Mountain Railway; Oxford Publishing Co, 2010) and they took the surname Assheton-Smith instead of Duff.

The Prince and Princess of Wales (later King George V and Queen Mary) stayed there as guests of the Assheton Smiths during a visit to North Wales in May 1902. To celebrate the 1935 Silver Jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary and to improve Caernarfon, the town walls and some adjoining property, which belonged to the estate, was handed over to the Ministry of Works. The estate's remaining property in Caernarfon was offered for sale in 103 lots in 1957.The Times 13 September 1957 In 1967 21,000 acres, including the north face of Snowdon, was sold to two property companies, jointly, for a reputed ¬£1¬Ω million.

Providencia's maximum elevation is above sea level. The smaller Santa Catalina Island to the northwest is connected by a footbridge to its larger sister Providencia Island. The Providencia Island has 17 square kilometers, the two islands cover an area of and form the municipality of Santa Isabel, which had a population of 4,927 at the Census of 2005. The island is served by El Embrujo Airport, which the Colombian Government plans to expand in order to take international flights. The island was the site of an English Puritan colony established in 1629 by the Providence Island Company, and was taken by Spain in 1641. The pirate Henry Morgan used Providencia as a base for raiding the Spanish empire, and rumours suggest that much of his treasure remains hidden on the island. Many parts of the island are named after Morgan. Forts and cannons dating back hundreds of years can be found scattered all over Santa Catalina Island.  Early times of the colony  The colony was hampered by poor planning, internal strife (seen in conflict among leadership) and economic woes. It was founded, in part, to create a profitable and Godly Puritan base. It was expected to be more profitable and successful than the Massachusetts Bay Colony that was founded in 1630. The colony is known for its involvement in the trade in slaves and was the beginning of the English use of Africans as life-long slaves instead of indentured servants. Some of the more famous characters were the governors Nathaniel Butler and Philip Bell, Bell's father-in-law Daniel Elfrith, and William Rous. Philip Bell was the first governor and was replaced by Robert Hunt, due to conflict with another colonist. Nathaniel Butler later replaced Hunt. Many of these men had already had experience with England's colonizing and economic expeditions with the Virginia Company and the Somers (Bermuda) Company. It is possible to infer what life was like on the island based on the accounts of slaves. They reported that some of the Englishmen who wanted to leave said \\"this place is no way to live\\" as a complaint against eating turtles all the time. Life included church services, trade with English ships, and hopes for corsair raids against the Spanish. Much tobacco was grown on the island by the African and Native American slaves. The colonists traveled around the island's freshwater streams and surrounding waters for fishing and finding turtles. They sometimes brought back Miskito Indians from their expeditions to the mainland of present day Nicaragua. The principal trading port had several small forts around the harbor and at the bay's entrance. There were about fourteen forts in all. = Privateering = Drawing of the fortress of pirate Louis Michel Aury by Louis P√©rou de Lacroix (1821) Due to the economic difficulties the colonists faced, some turned to privateering to make money. This is surprising to many because it seems in conflict with Puritan values. Though England and Spain were not at war, the desire to protect the respective countries‚Äô interests in the West Indies only increased tensions between the two nations. While Nathaniel Butler was governor, much of his time was spent looking after the needs of privateers. He was hoping to revitalize the colony's hurting economy, which in turn would improve the morale and hopes of the disgruntled colonists. In addition, he was worried that the English and Dutch activity in a heavily Spanish-controlled area would attract unwanted attention. The island's focus turned to defense and by 1638 the colony expected a Spanish attack within a year. Several men were sent on privateering expeditions themselves and a council of war was created. This is one major difference between the Providence Island colony and other English colonies; as Karen Kupperman observes, in the New England colonies, ‚Äúsuccess was accompanied by lodging such issues firmly under civilian control. In the threatening world of the western Caribbean, such amateurism was not seen as possible.‚Äù However, the privateering expeditions proved unsuccessful due to inexperience and lack of general sailing or West Indies knowledge.  People  Although the island is part of Colombia, the 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants are reported to feel more Caribbean than Colombian, with many Rastafari. The inhabitants mostly speak English or San Andr√©s‚ÄìProvidencia Creole, an English- based creole similar to Belize Kriol and Jamaican Patwa, rather than the Spanish of Colombia,A Report on the English-Based Creole of San Andres and Providence Islands, Colombia, Ken Decker and Andy Keener, SIL International, 2001. The section on Linguistics discusses Islander Creole in detail and finds it sufficiently similar to Belize Kriol and Jamaican Patwa that islanders can understand speech in the other dialects as well as Provisle, an indigenous sign language. the island was not seriously affected by the violent drug trafficking of Colombia, but many islanders were recruited to work for traffickers due to their seafaring skills and knowledge of the waters of the area, and to the scarcity of other employment opportunities on the island. It was estimated that about 800 young men out of the island's small population were in jails abroad, or had simply disappeared.BBC World Service:The island where men are disappearing, 12 October 2015  Environment  Aerial view towards Manzanillo beach and Old Providence McBean Lagoon on the east coast of Providencia Island The 995-hectare national park Old Providence McBean Lagoon is located on the island's northeast side, between Maracaibo and Rocky Point. This National Park consists of coral reefs, small Cayes, mangroves, lagoons and tropical dry forest. The National Park has a tiny visitor centre on Crab Caye, from where there are views towards the barrier reef and the waters that surround the caye. A local population of black land crabs is noteworthy for its breeding migration, which occurs every April/May. These crabs live in the hills of the island and descend (en masse) to the sea once a year to lay their eggs. Providencia is the centre point of the UNESCO Marine Protected Area the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, which forms 10% of the entire Caribbean Sea. This ecologically important reserve contains some of the world's greatest marine biodiversity, and incorporates the Archipelago of San Andr√©s, Providencia and Santa Catalina, in addition to the remote uninhabited cays at Roncador Bank, Serrana Bank, as well as distant reefs that include Quita Sue√±o Bank, Rosalind Bank and Alice Shoal.

Cahoot was launched in June 2000, as the internet based banking brand of Abbey National plc, and by December 2008, it had 750,000 customers. Cahoot is based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. History There have been several instances of security or operational failures with the website. The initial launch of the bank in 2000 resulted in the website crashing. One case in November 2004 was a security scare, in which it was revealed that customers' accounts could be accessed without going through security procedures, after an update to the online banking system. From 15 to 16 October 2008, the secure section of the Cahoot website became unavailable, due, according to Cahoot, to a power outage in Spain. Although the main page of the website operated normally, it proved impossible for customers to log in to access their savings, leaving them unable to access their accounts and carry out transactions. Call centre staff were also unable to carry out any transactions for customers. Customers were able to access their accounts again normally on 17 October 2008.Cahoot customers now able to access accounts Lauren Thompson. Times Online. 17 October 2008 Prior to the takeover of parent bank Abbey by Santander, Cahoot recovered from its launch and security issues to achieve over 600,000 accounts, and a significant share of the unsecured lending market in the United Kingdom. It was consistently rated in Consumers' Association and Guardian surveys in the top three best banks in the United Kingdom, for service and pricing. Initially led by Tim Murley, the role was taken over by Tim Sawyer in November 2002, who was succeeded by John Goddard in September 2005. Abbey was renamed under its parent's brand in January 2010, although Cahoot and other specialist brands of the bank were retained by Santander. Services Cahoot operates as a division of Santander UK, and shares Santander's banking licence and headquarters. Its business model involves a very small operational staff, with IT services initially in 2003 outsourced to IBM using their \\"Software on Demand\\" model.IBM Case Study IBM As of May 2013, Cahoot only offer savings accounts for new customers, but also provided credit cards and personal loans to new business until 2006. Cahoot also provided a \\"Webcard\\" facility which generated a one time card number for each online transaction (controlled payment number), as a measure to combat card fraud. The feature was withdrawn in October 2009. The flexible loan service was discontinued in the second quarter of 2009 to 2010, and it was later learned that the product's high interest rate (for some 22%) had been 'frozen' and transferred to Santander at some point. The flexible loan was designed as a credit facility, a bit like a credit card, to borrow and repay as necessary, offering attractive interest rates at first. New credit card business had ceased in 2006, although customers could continue using their credit card limits and available balances as normal. Cahoot also provided current accounts, though it withdrew these from new business in February 2010. Before January 2010, Cahoot informed customers that their loan limits had been \\"reviewed\\" and gave thirty days' notice that the withdraw service was disappearing. Cahoot has now discontinued all products being available to new customers. On 7 June 2015, Cahoot ceased to pay interest on current account balances. Its call centre operates on skeleton staffing, compared to most inbound call centres, and does not have specialised call centre staff advising on specific products; instead, staff are trained on a broad range of products. Cahoot introduced the Faster Payments Service on 1 January 2012, the latest date possible under Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulations. On 6 April 2020, Cahoot officially withdrew the interest free overdraft facility on its current accounts.

Drummers at the funeral of jazz legend Danny Barker in 1994. They include Louis Cottrell, (great-grandson of New Orleans' innovative drumming pioneer, Louis Cottrell, Sr. and grandson of New Orleans clarinetist Louis Cottrell, Jr.) of the Young Tuxedo Brass Band, far right; Louis \\"Bicycle Lewie\\" Lederman of the Down & Dirty Brass band, second from right. History The term \\"jazz funeral\\" was long in use by observers from elsewhere, but was generally disdained as inappropriate by most New Orleans musicians and practitioners of the tradition. The preferred description was \\"funeral with music\\"; while jazz was part of the music played, it was not the primary focus of the ceremony. This reluctance to use the term faded significantly in the final 15 years or so of the 20th century among the younger generation of New Orleans brass band musicians more familiar with the post-Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Soul Rebels Brass Band funk influenced style than the older traditional New Orleans jazz. The tradition blends strong European and African cultural influences. Louisiana's colonial past gave it a tradition of military style brass bands which were called on for many occasions, including playing funeral processions.Stewart, 2004 This was combined with African spiritual practices, specifically the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. Jazz funerals are also heavily influenced by early twentieth century African American Protestant and Catholic churches, black brass bands, and the idea of celebrating after death in order to please the spirits who protect the dead. Another group that has influenced jazz funerals is the Mardi Gras Indians.Turner, 89 The tradition was widespread among New Orleanians across ethnic boundaries at the start of the 20th century. As the common brass band music became wilder in the years before World War I, some white New Orleanians considered the hot music disrespectful, and such musical funerals became rare among the city's white citizens. After the 1960s, it gradually started being practised across ethnic and religious boundaries. Most commonly such musical funerals are done for individuals who are musicians themselves, connected to the music industry, or members of various social aid and pleasure clubs or Carnival krewes who make a point of arranging for such funerals for members. Although the majority of jazz funerals are for African American musicians there has been a new trend in which jazz funerals are given to young people who have died.Sakakeeny, 2011 The organizers of the funeral arrange for hiring the band as part of the services. When a respected fellow musician or prominent member of the community dies, some additional musicians may also play in the procession as a sign of their esteem for the deceased.\\"Jazz Funerals\\", 2004 A typical jazz funeral begins with a march by the family, friends, and a brass band from the home, funeral home or church to the cemetery. Throughout the march, the band plays somber dirges and hymns. A change in the tenor of the ceremony takes place, after either the deceased is entombed, or the hearse leaves the procession and members of the procession say their final goodbye and they \\"cut the body loose\\". After this the music becomes more upbeat, often starting with a hymn or spiritual number played in a swinging fashion, then going into popular hot tunes. There is raucous music and cathartic dancing where onlookers join in to celebrate the life of the deceased. Those who follow the band just to enjoy the music are called the second line, and their style of dancing, in which they walk and sometimes twirl a parasol or handkerchief in the air, is called second lining.Spitzer, \\"Rebuilding the Land of Dreams-Part 7\\" Some typical pieces often played at jazz funerals are the slow, and somber song \\"Nearer My God to Thee\\" and such spirituals as \\"Just a Closer Walk With Thee\\". The later more upbeat tunes frequently include \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" and \\"Didn't He Ramble\\".New Orleans Online, \\"The Jazz Funeral\\" Notable jazz funerals St. Augustine Church in the Trem√© neighborhood; Dr. Michael White in foreground. * Ed Bradley * Paul Barbarin * Danny Barker * Pud Brown * Papa Celestin * Louis Cottrell, Jr. * Ernie K-Doe * Snooks Eaglin * Captain Phil Harris * Jim Henson * Helen Hill * Abram Wilson * Allan Jaffe, Preservation Hall proprietor * Anthony Lacen (Tuba Fats) * Austin Leslie * Professor Longhair * Allison \\"Tootie\\" Montana * Paolo Mantovani * Ernest \\"Doc\\" Paulin * Alphonse Picou * Ike Turner * Soulja Slim * Ben Tucker * \\"Uncle\\" Lionel Batiste *David Bowie (Second Line) * Pete Fountain * Fats Domino * Dr. John  See also  * Month's Mind * Historic Cemeteries of New Orleans * Dancing Pallbearers References Further reading * \\"Funerals with Music in New Orleans\\", Dr. Jack Stewart, Save Our Cemeteries, Incorporated, & J.

On March 22, 2019, the Texas Rangers announced that Hammel had made the opening day roster. Retirement On March 23, 2019, Hammel announced his retirement from baseball. Pitching style Hammel throws a mix of five pitches: a four-seam fastball at 92‚Äì95 mph, a two-seam fastball (his lead pitch) at the same speed, a slider in the mid 80s, a curveball in the upper 70s, and a changeup in the high 80s. He uses all of his pitches against left-handed hitters, but eliminates the changeup against right-handers. His chief off-speed pitch with 2 strikes is the slider. Prior to the 2012 season Hammel relied mostly on the four-seamer, slider, and curve. In 2012, he shifted to a sinker/slider focus, with the other pitches playing less of a role. All of his pitches except the changeup produced above- average whiff rates in 2012, leading to a career-high K/9 rate of 8.6 Personal life Hammel met Elissa Nichols in 2006 and they married in 2009. Together they have a son, Beckett, and a daughter, Colby.

It was a scientific society and produced the Proceedings of the Physical Society of London. In 1921 the society became the Physical Society and in 1960 merged with the Institute of Physics (IOP), the combined organisation eventually adopting the name of the latter society. The society was formed in 1874 due to the efforts of Professor Frederick Guthrie, Professor of Physics at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington, and his assistant, William Fletcher Barrett. They canvassed support for a 'Society for physical research' and on 14 February 1874, the Physical Society of London was formed with an initial membership of 29 people. The Society's first president was John Hall Gladstone. Meetings were held every two weeks, mainly at Imperial College London. From its beginning, the society held open meetings and demonstrations and published Proceedings of the Physical Society. The first Guthrie lecture, now known as the Faraday Medal and Prize, was delivered in 1914. In 1921 the society became the Physical Society and in 1932 absorbed the Optical Society (of London). In 1960 the merger with the Institute of Physics took place, creating the Institute of Physics and the Physical Society, which combined the learned society tradition of the Physical Society with the professional body tradition of the Institute of Physics.Institute of Physics History Upon being granted a royal charter in 1970, the organization renamed itself as the Institute of Physics.Royal Charter of the Institute of Physics Presidents of the Physical Society *1874‚Äì1876 John H.

It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label on October 7, 1994. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and grossed $71,368 at the North American box office becoming a financial flop. It has been regarded by most professional critics as Bluth's worst film. The film features the voice talents of Dom DeLuise as Stanley, Cloris Leachman as Queen Gnorga, Charles Nelson Reilly as King Llort, Phillip Glasser as Gus, Tawny Sunshine Glover as Rosie, Hayley Mills as Hilary and Jonathan Pryce as Alan. It is the last Don Bluth film to star Dom DeLuise.  Plot  Stanley is a troll who has a magical green thumb with the ability to bring flowers and plants to life at a touch, which is forbidden in his home, the Kingdom of Trolls. When he is discovered doing so, the other trolls take him as prisoner to Gnorga, the queen of the trolls, who concludes that Stanley \\"gives a bad name to trolls everywhere\\" and demands that he be transformed to stone with her dark thumb (which is also purple when it glows). At the behest of her consort King Llort, Queen Gnorga instead banishes Stanley to Central Park in New York City where, after a series of mishaps, he ends up in a cave under the bridge. The next day, in a New York apartment, two young siblings named Gus and Rosie learn that their parents cannot take them to Central Park, because their father Alan has to go to court for an important case, and their mother Hilary has to attend the open house on Park Avenue. While left alone with their nanny, Maria, Gus takes Rosie to the park himself. While playing with Gus' toy boat by the river, Rosie chases a butterfly to the bridge where she mistakes Stanley for her own troll doll. Realizing Stanley is a real troll, she begins to follow Stanley into the cave and befriends him. Gus goes after Rosie, only for his toy boat to be accidentally smashed in the process. After becoming surprised to meet Stanley and his crew of talking flowers, Gus tries to force Rosie to come home with him. Stanley then gets into an argument and struggle with Gus over Rosie which causes her to cry. At the Kingdom of Trolls, Gnorga enjoys her amusement of Rosie's sadness on her crystal, but when she discovers Stanley, she becomes furious. Having also witnessed Gus' frustration towards Rosie and Stanley, she decides to have an advantage and casts an evil spell on him, making Gus cry a gigantic flood of tears to drown Stanley along with his flowers and Rosie. Using his green thumb, Stanley enlarges Gus' toy boat which he repaired, transforming it into a \\"dream boat\\" to save the kids, and they escape together. Determined to suppress Stanley herself, Gnorga sends a tornado to transport her and Llort to Central Park while it destroys the park and everything green on it. Meanwhile, Gus and Rosie wake from their nap and decides to get back home. The two kids are then chased by Gnorga and Llort, who intend to use them as their bait for Stanley. Gnorga succeeds to kidnap Rosie, but Gus manages to elude her, thanks to Llort's incompetence. He returns to the cave in the bridge and tries to persuade Stanley to help him. But Stanley, frightened of the reign of Gnorga, refuses and claims that his magic is no match for Gnorga's. Gus angrily accuses Stanley of being a coward and tells him that he will never have a dream come true if he's too scared to fight for what he believes in. Gus leaves to face Gnorga himself, with the flowers and animals as his back-up. Arriving at the abandoned building where Gnorga and Llort are waiting for Stanley, Gus finds Rosie in a kennel and sets her free, while the flowers tied up Gnorga's dog. But seeing the children get away, Gnorga and Llort chase them out the building, leading to a battle. During the fight, Gnorga transforms Gus into a troll with her dark magic, and Rosie falls into a chasm. Stanley appears on Gus' toy boat; now transformed into a flying boat with leaf wings, having saved the uninjured Rosie. Then he steps forward and challenges Gnorga to a thumb-wrestling match. Stanley manages to win, planting roses all around Gnorga's body. As Stanley, Gus, and Rosie escape and celebrate their victory, Gnorga uses Gus' thumb to transform Stanley to stone. Gus' toy boat transforms back to normal, sending the two kids falling through the open window and into their apartment room, while Stanley (in his statue form) lands on top of the nearby trash can. As Gnorga declares her job done, the last of Stanley's power changes her into a rose bush. Then the tornado reappeared and sucked Gnorga, Llort, and their dog back to the Kingdom of Trolls in defeat, while Gus returns to his human form. The next morning, Gus, Rosie, and their parents visit Central Park, where Gus and Rosie place the petrified Stanley on a makeshift pedestal. Gus attempts to revive him with his temporarily green thumb and appears to fail. As they prepare to leave, he and Rosie transform back to find Stanley gone. Then hearing Stanley's whistle, they see Stanley standing on the tree with his flowers; restored to life. Stanley revives Central Park and covers the whole city in vegetation and flowers. The movie ends back in the Kingdom of Trolls, the powerless Gnorga is dethroned and planted, and Llort is welcomed as a much kinder ruler. He is reading the newspapers describing her as the \\"queen of posies\\", and laughing about her humiliation, right before he gets constantly attacked by Gnorga's dog just as the credits roll.  Cast  * Dom DeLuise as Stanley * Cloris Leachman as Gnorga * Charles Nelson Reilly as Llort * Phillip Glasser as Gus * Tawny Sunshine Glover as Rosie * Jonathan Pryce as Alan * Hayley Mills as Hillary * Neil Ross as Generic Pansy * Will Ryan as Boss, Guard * Pat Musick as Snuffy  Production  Production on the film began in 1990, following the near completion of Rock-a-Doodle. Buddy Hackett and Robert Morley were originally considered for the roles of Stanley and King Llort, but were eventually replaced by Dom DeLuise and Charles Nelson Reilly. Even though the film was completed in 1992, it was not released in theaters until 1994. At that time, the film was originally slated for a March 1994 release, but due to production difficulties and the producers deciding to release Thumbelina first, the film's release date was changed to October 7, 1994.  Soundtrack  The music for A Troll in Central Park was composed and conducted by Robert Folk, who previously provided the soundtrack for Rock-a-Doodle (1991), and was performed by the Irish Film Orchestra. Although a commercial soundtrack was not released alongside the film in 1994, a limited edition CD containing 15 tracks from the movie was made available on February 12, 2012, by Intrada Records as part of their Intrada Special Collection. The tracks were taken from the original digital session masters, with three songs written by Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Norman Gimbel and Robert Folk ultimately omitted due to being permanently wedded to sound effects and dialogue from the film.  Reception  = Box office = The film grossed $71,368 in North America. It was Don Bluth's lowest-grossing film to date, though not his film to lose the most money overall. Gary Goldman said the reason for this was that the film was released without any promotion and its release was limited. He also stated that its former distributor Warner Bros. did not have any confidence in the film. = Critical reception = A Troll in Central Park holds an approval rating of 14% with an average of 3.48 out of 10 based on seven reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. TV Guide gave the film two out of five stars and felt that the film's appeal was very age-limited, calling it \\"Pastel-pretty and cloyingly sweet,\\" and that \\"A Troll in Central Park is strictly for the youngest members of the moviegoing audience.\\" The A.V. Club wrote that A Troll in Central Park is \\"widely considered to be [Don Bluth's] worst film.\\" Bluth has distanced himself from the film, stating in the July 2001 issue of his magazine ToonTalk, that \\"the development of a story is like the development of a child in a womb; it takes time and it must be done right and building A Troll in Central Park, taught us this lesson, the hard way.\\"  Home media  On January 10, 1995, Warner Home Video released A Troll in Central Park on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States and Canada. In the UK, the film was released on VHS under the title Stanley's Magic Garden. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD for the first time on February 19, 2002.

Irrigation timers first appeared in the early 1960s to control large-radius lawn sprinklers, which at the time usually contained their own electrically operated valve (most golf-course sprinklers still use this type of actuation). These timers were large and cumbersome with numerous mechanical parts and were usually relegated to agricultural and commercial applications. Compact irrigation timers did not become commonplace until the 1970s when Lawn Genie introduced a mechanical timer which measured only ten by six inches and was four inches deep. This controller proved popular for many years, but was hard to reprogram and it did not operate valves in immediate succession unless each valve was set to run for an hour. Rain Bird later introduced the RC-7A to their Rain Clox line, which featured an \\"at a glance\\" electromechanical programming interface that proved very easy to operate, and offered the ability to omit stations from the program sequence without creating time gaps. This timer which became standard issue in many tract homes during the 1980s and proved to be remarkably durable in its construction, with many still operating today. Irrigation control systems almost always use 24-volt alternating current transmitted over two wires, one of which is \\"common\\" and connected to all the valves. Other, less-common systems involve fluid-filled hydraulic tubes to open or close the valves. Many companies followed with similar designs, such as Rainmaster, Griswold Controls, Toro, and Irritrol. In the late 1980s, the irrigation company Hydro-Rain introduced the first \\"hybrid\\" controller design, called the HR-6100, which combined electronic programming with a visual programming interface involving a single selector dial. This overtook the electromechanical timers as the most common design, and today nearly all timers sold are hybrid designs. The 1990s saw the introduction of computer-controlled \\"central control\\" systems, pioneered by Rain Bird for use on golf courses. This system was called \\"MaxiCom\\" and worked through a set of \\"cluster control units\\", each of which in turn synchronized a number of \\"satellite\\" controllers.

High school Niemann attended Lamar High School.http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/n/jeff-niemann.shtml College Niemann, who stands 6-foot-9, was the fourth starter for Rice University in his freshman season of 2002, usually starting midweek non-conference games. He posted a 5‚Äì1 record with a 3.11 ERA, including a victory over Washington in the decisive seventh game of the 2002 NCAA regional at Rice's Reckling Park. In 2003, he stepped into Rice's weekend rotation and quickly became the nation's most dominant pitcher. He finished the season 17‚Äì0 with a 1.70 ERA and 156 strikeouts, being named Western Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year, a consensus first-team all-American, and a finalist for the Rotary Smith Award in helping Rice to its first national championship. In 2002 and 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Niemann battled injuries as a junior in 2004, but still went 6‚Äì3 with a 3.02 ERA in 11 starts, including a complete game victory over Texas A&M; in the NCAA regional. The entire Rice weekend rotation, including Philip Humber, Wade Townsend, and Niemann, were all selected in the first eight picks of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft ‚Äì the first time three teammates had ever gone so early in the same draft. Professional Niemann was the Rays' first-round draft pick out of Rice University in 2004 as the fourth overall pick. He signed a major league contract in January 2005 worth $5.2 million. Niemann opened the 2005 season at Single-A Advanced Visalia, where he went 0‚Äì1 with a 3.98 ERA in five starts. After a promotion to the Double-A Montgomery Biscuits, he went 0‚Äì1 with a 4.35 ERA in six appearances, including three starts. He had offseason surgery in 2005 to shave the joint between his collarbone and shoulder and returned to Montgomery in 2006. Flanked in the rotation by starting pitchers Andy Sonnanstine and Mitch Talbot during the Southern League playoffs, Niemann helped lead the Biscuits to the 2006 championship. Following the 2006 season, Baseball America named Niemann the Rays' fourth-best prospect, following Delmon Young, Evan Longoria, and Reid Brignac; they also said Niemann possessed the best slider of any pitcher in the Rays' organization.BaseballAmerica.com: Prospects: Top 10 Prospects: Tampa Bay Rays Niemann spent the season with the Triple-A Durham Bulls.

Niemann made his major league debut on April 13, , against the Baltimore Orioles, pitching 6 innings en route to his first career win. Niemann's team leading 13‚Äì6 record and 3.94 ERA in 2009 earned him a place in national AL Rookie of the Year Award discussions. The Tampa Bay Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America named him the Rookie of the Year for the Rays for the 2009 season in a unanimous decision by the voters.Ben Zobrist named Rays MVP; Niemann the Rookie of the Year In 2012, Niemann got hit with a come-backer by Adam Lind of the Blue Jays on May 14, 2012 which fractured his leg.

Life Little is known of his life, and his work is dubiously inferred, rather than accurately known, from a folio of drawings in the Sir John Soane's Museum, to which Horace Walpole called attention, in 1780, in his Anecdotes of Painting; but how far these were his own is uncertain. He was engaged on a number of important English houses of his time, and several, such as Longleat, have been attributed to him on grounds which cannot be sustained, because they were built before he was born. In 1570 when he was five years old, he laid the foundation stonepage 2:The Book of Architecture of John Thorpe in Sir John Soane's Museum, The 40th Volume of the Walpole Society, 1966, John Summerson of Kirby Hall, Northamptonshire his father being the Master mason of the project. He was probably the designer of Charlton House, in Charlton, London; the original Longford Castle, Wiltshire; Condover Hall and the original Holland House, Kensington; and he is said to have been engaged on Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire, and Audley End, Essex (with Bernard Janssens).

Previously, the fashion was the so-called enfilade arrangement of rooms in a dwelling in which each room led to the next via connecting internal doors. The enfilade remained popular in continental Europe long after the corridor was widely adopted in England. Flanders believes Thorpe's inspiration was the one-sided covered walkway common in monastic cloisters. Given their similarities, this is a reasonable prima facie conjecture. Thorpe joined the Office of Works as a clerk, then practised independently as a land surveyor. In August 1605 the Earl of Dorset wrote to \\"Mr Thorpe\\" to survey and make \\"plots\\" for the rebuilding of Ampthill for Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 17 (London, 1938), pp. 349‚Äì50. From 1611 he was assistant to Robert Tresswell, Surveyor-General of Woods South of the Trent. He retired in the 1630s but seems to have lived to an advanced age, dying around 1655.

History Tim Russert speaks at the plenary session of the 2007 PRSA international conference The Public Relations Society of America was formed in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. The society had its first annual conference in Philadelphia, where Richard Falk was given PRSA's first \\"annual citation\\" for advancing the field of public relations. Several ethical violations in the field led to discussions about ethics within the society. At the 1952 annual conference, a speaker used Adolf Hitler as an example of the potential abuse of communications. The society published its first code of conduct and its first Anvil awards two years later. The code of conduct was later ratified in 1959 and again in 1963. PRSA merged with the American Public Relations Association in 1961 and started its accreditation program for public relations professionals the next year.

It issued a consent order that required PRSA to remove content from its code of conduct that contained sexist language, discouraged soliciting clients from other members or encouraged price-fixing activities. PRSA's first definition of public relations was created in 1982 as \\"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.‚Äù In 1986, PRSA's then President Anthony Franco resigned from his post after it was revealed he was accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The PRSA's philanthropy arm, the PRSA Foundation, was founded in 1990. In 1994 O'Dwyer from the O'Dwyer's PR trade journal alleged that PRSA was violating copyright laws by lending articles from USA Today, The New York Times, O'Dwyer's and others to members. Although O'Dwyer has been a critic of PRSA since the 1970s, this is often considered the beginning of a long-term dispute between PRSA and O'DwyerWalls, Jeannette. \\"Copyrights And Wrongs.\\" Esquire 126.4 (1996): 28. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 27 Oct. 2012. that PR News described as a \\"never-ending back-and-forth.\\" In 1996 and 2011 O'Dwyer criticized PRSA on issues such as financial transparency, auditing and spending in the context of proposed increases in membership dues. PRSA said the increases were caused by an increase in services to members. In 2000, PRSA and the Institute of Public Relations signed a mutual declaration saying the two would work together in areas like ethics, education, accreditation, professional development and new media. The society started two efforts to revise its definition of public relations in 2003 and 2007, but neither moved forward. In November 2011, PRSA led an initiative called Public Relations Defined, in order to create a crowd-sourced definition of public relations. 927 submissions were made on PRSA's website filling in the blanks to the statement: \\"Public relations (does what) with or for (whom) to (do what) for (what purpose).‚Äù The winning definition was: \\"a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organisations and their bodies.\\" According to the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) \\"reactions to the new PRSA definition were mixed and views vigorously debated.\\" In 2011 PRSA publicized accusations that O'Dwyer had been eavesdropping on PRSA's conference calls. Later that year PRSA started refusing O'Dwyer entrance to their events and sent a 23-page letter to O'Dwyer describing his behavior as disruptive and unethical. The National Press Club tried to negotiate his entrance unsuccessfully. Organization In 2010 Richard Edelman (pictured) and the \\"Committee for a Democratic PRSA\\" called for the extension of full voting rights to in the group to members who did not hold the APR designation. PRSA is organized as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and governed by a set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well as anyone that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, nearly 375 student chaptersAbout PRSA. (2019). Retrieved from https://www.prsa.org/about/about-prsa/ and 14 interest groups. Since the 1970s, the PRSA had restricted the right to sit in the group's national assembly or to seek election to the national board to those possessing an APR certification. The requirement for the assembly was dropped in 2004, but was maintained for those seeking board membership. In 2010 a revolt led by Richard Edelman and a group calling itself \\"the Committee for a Democratic PRSA\\" called for the restriction to be scrapped. The attempt to overturn the rule was defeated in a vote during that year's session of the assembly. In 2003 a proposal to amend the society's bylaws to allow non-accredited professionals to run for PRSA's offices was defeated, but the motion passed the following year. Services Department of Defense staff holding the Silver Anvil award in 2008PRSA members receive access to a suite of tools that fosters professional development and career growth. PRSA is a member of the Universal Accreditation Board (UAB) which hosts an accreditation program called APR (accreditation in public relations) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories: research, planning, implementation and evaluation. Accreditation is usually granted to candidates with five to seven years of experience upon completion of written and oral examinations. About 20 percent of PRSA's members are accredited. PRSA hosts the Anvil awards, which are issued based on four components: research, planning, execution and evaluation. The Gold Anvil is awarded to individuals. The Silver Anvil is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics. It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick, Rookie of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year. PRSA's Public Relations Journal was published from October 1945 to 1995. Its original mission statement was \\"to carry articles that deal with fundamental public relations problems, as they currently press for solution.\\" The journal was comparable to a text-heavy academic periodical.Gower, Karla K. \\"Rediscovering Women In Public Relations.\\" Journalism History 27.1 (2001): 14. Communication & Mass Media Complete. Web. 29 Oct. 2012. PRSA still publishes The Strategist and Tactics. The Strategist is a quarterly glossy magazine intended for executives, while Tactics is a monthly news tabloid. The Public Relations Society of America publishes a code of ethics. Members that violate the code may have their membership revoked, usually under its mandate that members \\"not engage in any practice which tends to corrupt the integrity of channels of public communication\\" and that members act \\"in accord with public welfare.\\" The code also expects PRSA members to identify the source of their communications, avoid derogatory methods and avoid abusing insider information. According to the code of conduct, members should \\"protect and advance the free flow of accurate and truthful information; foster informed decision-making through open communication... and work to strengthen the public's trust in the profession.\\"Sommer, Susan. \\"PRSA Alaska Plays Vital Role At 35.\\" Alaska Business Monthly 28.1 (2012): 34-35.

The code states that members \\"adhere to the highest standards of accuracy and truth.\\" A story in CBS criticized the code: \\"Show me a PR person who is 'accurate' and 'truthful,' and I'll show you a PR person who is unemployed.\\" The code of ethics has been revised in 1954, 1959, 1963, 1977, 1983, 1988 and 2000.Fitzpatrick, Kathy R.

Research and advocacy The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication commissioned studies in 1975 and 1987 on the state of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major.Fischer, Rick. \\"Rethinking Public Relations Curricula: Evolution Of Thought 1975-1999.\\" Public Relations Quarterly 45.2 (2000): 16-20. Communication & Mass Media Complete. Web. 29 Oct. 2012. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis. PRSA advocates for the trust, credibility and respect of public relations as a profession, believing that PR can facilitate open communication that allows for an informed public and supports the democratic process. In 1999, a National Credibility Index from PRSA found that PR professionals were among the least credible of professions as a spokesperson. The PRSA objected to the actions of the Redner Group in 2011, when the PR firm threatened to blacklist media that gave Duke Nukem negative reviews. In 2012 a Senate subcommittee investigated the communications and advertising spend of eleven government agencies. PRSA opposed the investigation, presenting that the effort dismissed the value of public relations in government.

Unlike many Dr. Seuss books, it is narrated in prose rather than verse. Plot The King's Stilts tells the story of King Birtram of Binn, who dedicates himself to safeguarding his kingdom, a low-lying land surrounded by high water that is held back by a ring of dike trees. Unfortunately, the dike trees are the favorite food of a species of pest-birds called nizzards; the kingdom always faces the risk that the nizzards might compromise the dike-tree barrier and cause catastrophic flooding. The King's administration maintains a legion of Patrol Cats to keep the nizzards at bay; King Birtram sees to their care personally. When not attending to his royal duties, the King enjoys himself by frolicking in the streets on his red stilts. One day, his minister Lord Droon, secretly a gloomy thief who plots to capture the stilts, persuades the King's page boy Eric to steal and hide the stilts. Deprived of his amusement, the King grows depressed and begins to neglect his duties. As a result, the Patrol Cats become less vigilant, and soon the nizzards make headway in eating away the dike trees. Seeing the results of his actions, Eric resolves to return the stilts to the King and succeeds in doing so despite Lord Droon's efforts to stop him. King Birtram, his personal morale restored, finds the energy to mobilize the Patrol Cats to fight off the nizzards and save the kingdom. Lord Droon is arrested and punished with a restricted diet consisting entirely of nizzard cooked in various ways. Eric is rewarded with his own pair of red stilts, and joins the King on his outings. Publication and reception The King's Stilts was published in 1939, as Geisel's second book for Random House and his fourth book overall.Cohen 2004, p. 199 Although it was considerably more successful than his previous book, The Seven Lady Godivas, its sales were still a disappointment: 4,648 copies were sold in 1939 and 394 in 1940.Cohen 2004, p. 201 Reception References * Cohen, Charles (2004).

One of Seuss's few books written for adults, its original 1939 publication by Random House was a failure and was eventually remaindered. However, it later gained popularity as Seuss himself grew in fame, and was republished in 1987. Plot overview The book recounts in prose the tale of seven Godiva sisters, none of whom ever wear clothing. The explanation for their nakedness, even when walking in snow, is that \\"they were simply themselves and chose not to disguise it.\\" The story opens with the sisters' father, Lord Godiva, deciding to leave for the Battle of Hastings (1066) on horseback. This upsets the sisters, as horses are wild and untamed animals. Sure enough, before Lord Godiva even manages to leave the castle walls, he is flung from his horse and killed. As a tribute to their father's fate, the Godiva sisters agree to never marry‚Äîdespite the fact that each is courting one of seven brothers named Peeping‚Äîuntil they can warn their countrymen of the dangers of horses. The book then follows the sisters as they set out on individual quests for \\"horse truths\\", which turn out to be well-known sayings involving horses. Publication history Seuss reportedly had misgivings about The Seven Lady Godivas before its publication; the drawing on the endpaper contains a small bucket of sap labeled \\"Bennett Cerf,\\" the name of Seuss's publisher at Random House. Seuss, by calling Cerf a sap, was apparently implying that Cerf was being too nice in allowing the book to be published. The initial 1939 publishing had a print run of 10,000 copies, but only around 2,500 sold. (One authority states that only 50 were sold.Martin, Judith (1971), \\"Good times, rhymes pay Dr. Seuss richly\\" Boston Globe, Nov 21, 1971; pg. B_4) Seuss himself called it his \\"greatest failure\\" and \\"a book that nobody bought\\". To another interviewer he said \\"It was all full of naked women, and I can't draw convincing naked women. I put their knees in the wrong places.\\" It became one of only two Dr Seuss books, along with The Cat in the Hat Songbook, to be allowed to go out of print.Morgan (1995), p. 193 The remaining copies were remaindered in the chain of Schulte's Cigar Stores for twenty-five cents, though original editions now have been reported as selling at prices as high as $300. The book's initial failure has been attributed to several factors: at two dollars, it was priced relatively high for the Great Depression era. Also, the book's depiction of nudity, though it was intended for adults and was very restrained, led to cold reception. In 1974, Carolyn See wrote in Esquire that \\"America was feeling too blue to be cheered up by pictures of silly ladies\\". Seuss said he tried to draw \\"the sexiest-looking women\\" he could, but they \\"came out just ridiculous\\". The failure of The Seven Lady Godivas, Seuss's fourth book, may well have led to his subsequent immersion into the world of children's literature. He stated that he would \\"rather write for kids\\", who were more appreciative, and was no longer interested in writing for adults. Indeed, his general contempt for adults is evident in his oft-repeated quote: \\"Adults are obsolete children, and the hell with them.\\" When he eventually did publish a second book aimed at adults (You're Only Old Once!, in 1986), it was subtitled A Book for Obsolete Children.

It is long north-south, between wide, with an area of about 649 km¬≤, and a population estimated at 12,000 in 12 villages mainly in the north of the island (9,292 as of the census of 2003, of which were 2,311 foreigners). Administratively, it forms one of the eleven provinces (Wilayah, plural Wilayat) of the Ash Sharqiyah Region. The principal village is Ra æs-·∏§ilf () in the northern part of the island. It contains a Royal Air Force of Oman air base and a fish factory, as well as a few small towns. Previously, the BBC had a relay facility consisting of both HF and MF broadcasting transmitters stationed there. Most of the island's interior is deserted, with access to the island only possible by a small ferry for cars or by Royal Air Force of Oman Airbus A320 or Lockheed C-130 Hercules flights. The main industries are fishing and traditional textile manufacturing. Formerly, traditional shipbuilding was important. Landscape The rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked dhows on the beaches of the island, most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat. About 2:20 A.M. on 21 September 1835, the USS Peacock grounded on a coral reef. At high noon, the latitude was determined to be 20¬∞ 00‚Ä≤ north, and the longitude 58¬∞ 5‚Ä≥ east. Peacock later obtained this letter: > I certify that during the period I have navigated the Arabian coast, and > been employed in the trigonometrical survey of the same, now executing by > order of the Bombay government, that I have ever found it necessary to be > careful to take nocturnal as well as diurnal observations, as frequent as > possible, owing to the rapidity and fickleness of the currents, which, in > some parts, I have found running at the rate of three and four knots, and I > have known the Palinurus set between forty and fifty miles dead in shore, in > a dead calm, during the night.

The ocean bottom environment surrounding Masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock. There is a swift current flowing through the area with a very sharp halocline visible on the surface of the ocean. The water depth nearby is around 10 m and is not conducive to side- scan sonar searches due to the shallow water and choppy surface conditions. Despite the poor quality ocean bottom, the area is very productive with marine fisheries, and any hard objects (barrels, engines) are immediately colonized by local fauna. During summer there is normally a constant strong wind which is ideal for kite and windsurfers. Big waves are a result of the wind on the sea side and is so also attractive for wave surfers. Kite and windsurfers can pick spots around the island according to their skill and what conditions they prefer. On 5‚Äì6 June 2007, 7000 people on the island were forced to temporarily leave their homes due to the high storm waves produced by the powerful Cyclone Gonu, the strongest to hit the Persian Gulf region in 60 years.  Geography  A dhow with the island in the background Located about off the east side of Barr al Hikman, the island is generally hilly, especially on its east side. The hills along the east side of the island are separated from the island coast by a narrow sandy plain; they run nearly its entire length. A steep plateau stands in the middle of the range on the northeast side of the island. Along the west side of the island, there are a few low hills separated from the east range by an extensive sandy plain marked by several hillocks: * Jabal Madrub, a high mountain, stands about south of the north end of the island. * Ras Abu Rasas, the south extremity of Al Masirah, is low and rocky. Jabal Suwayr (Jabal al Hilm), a conspicuous conical hill, rises to a height of , about north-northeast of Ras Abu Rasas. * Ras Kaydah, a small and rocky headland, has a conspicuous, conical hill about high nearby. There are small islets east and north of Ras Kayda. * The coast between Ras Kaydah and Ras Zafaranat, about to the northeast, is regular with a few small rounded projections and a low rocky beach. Haql (Hakkan), a small village in a grove of trees, lies close to the shore about eight km north of Ras Kaydah. * Ras Zafaranat is rocky with hills rising abruptly. Between Ras Abu Rasas and Ras Kaydah, about to the northeast, the coast is indented by small, sandy bays fringed by rocks. * Ras al-Ya, about northeast of Ras Zafaranat, is the east extremity of the island and consists of a prominent bluff rising to a ridge of hills which extend westward to the center of the island.

Tourism Ferry preparing to sail for Masirah Island Masirah Island has just opened for tourism. One can still only get to the island by ferry, managed by the National Ferry Company www.nfc.om, which runs six times a day between Shannah to Masirah. By now, there is a four-star-hotel and a kitesurfing camp. For kitesurfers, Masirah is an attractive spot in summer because of the monsoon winds which blow steadily at over 20 knots. Rental cars are available on the island. Military base The remains of the RAF fuel store on Masirah Island in 1984 The British established a military presence on Masirah in the 1930s. A small stone building, a fuel store for land based aircraft flying between Aden and Muscat, stood at the midpoint of the island on the west side, and had a stone above the door inscribed \\"RAF 1936\\". Reputedly, the fuel store was locked and visiting aircrew used to bring a key, refuel from cans, lock the store and fly onwards. A dispute between British forces and the local inhabitants took place in 1942, led by one of two local sheikhs, who were eventually forced to flee the island.Top Secret Cabinet Office Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and Secretary of State for India (CP 45 3) of 29 May 1945. The National Archives, Kew. During WW II, The British paid the Sultan of Muscat a stipend of ¬£18,000 per annum for affording British forces 'necessary facilities', which included Masirah. A Cabinet Office memorandum of 1945 recommended the acquisition of Masirah on a 99-year lease, US interests in the island notwithstanding (During World War II the United States also had a base on the island.). The Sultan was to be offered an annual payment of ¬£3,750 with an initial premium of ¬£7,500. The base continued to expand into the 1970s, supporting British and Oman forces fighting insurgents during the Dhofar Rebellion and providing transit facilities for long-distance RAF flights. The British military presence at RAF Masirah extended until 31 March 1977, when Sultan of Oman's Air Force (now the Royal Air Force of Oman) took over the base, which became first SOAF Masirah and then RAFO Masirah. In the 1970s, the base included a HF communications hub and a rear link to SAS units based in Oman in support of the actions against rebels in the south of the country (RAF Salalah). United States' units used Masirah Island as a staging base in Operation Eagle Claw, the unsuccessful 1980 attempt to free US hostages then held in Iran. The island was subsequently used as a staging area for operations into Afghanistan in 2001. , the American private military contractor DynCorp had a contract to staff and serve a US military storage- depot at this base.

In the story, a boy named Marco, who first appeared in Geisel's 1937 book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, imagines a wide variety of strange fish that could be swimming in the pond in which he is fishing. Plot The story begins as a boy named Marco fishes in a small, trash-filled pond, McElligot's Pool. A local farmer laughs at the boy and tells him that he is never going to catch anything. Nevertheless, Marco holds out hope and begins to imagine a scenario in which he might be able to catch a fish. First, he suggests that the pool might be fed by an underground brook that travels under a highway and a hotel to reach the sea. Marco then imagines a succession of fish and other creatures that could be in the sea and therefore the pool. He imagines, among others, a fish with a checkerboard stomach, a seahorse with the head of an actual horse, and an eel with two heads. When Marco is done imagining, he tells the farmer, \\"Oh, the sea is so full of a number of fish,/ If a fellow is patient, he might get his wish!\\" Creation Geisel painted some of the water colors that illustrate McElligot's Pool while vacationing with his wife, Helen, at the summer home of their friend Kelvin Vanderlip, in Southern California.Morgan & Morgan 1995, pp. 120‚Äì122 The book was the first Dr. Seuss book to use water colors for its illustrations; however, because of budget concerns, Random House published half of the book in black and white, alternating between two pages in color and two pages in black and white. Marco, the book's main character, first appeared in And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,Fensch 2001, pp. 90‚Äì93 the first Dr. Seuss book published in 1937 by Vanguard Press. Geisel dedicated the book to his father, whom the dedication refers to as \\"the World's Greatest Authority on Blackfish, Fiddler Crabs, and Deegel Trout.\\" According to Dr. Seuss biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, \\"deegel trout\\" was a private joke between Geisel and his father that was started during a fishing trip when Geisel was a boy. His father had bought large trout from Deegel hatchery and pretended that they had caught them. Reception McElligot's Pool, Geisel's first book in seven years, was published by Random House in 1947 and was well received. It became a Junior Literary Guild selection and garnered Geisel his first Caldecott Honor. The review in the Saturday Review of Literature stated, \\"Children will have nothing but admiration for this boy who heard there were no fish in McElligot's Pool and then saw them swimming in from the sea.\\" M.B. King of the Chicago Sun emphasized the book's humor, writing, \\"This time prepare to chuckle under water for you'll be meeting the weirdest, wildest, funniest creatures of the sea which imagination can conjur.\\" S.J.

It follows the adventures of a young boy named Bartholomew Cubbins, who must rescue his kingdom from a sticky green substance called \\"oobleck.\\" The book is a sequel of sorts to The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins. Unlike most of Geisel's books, which are written in anapestic tetrameter, Bartholomew and the Oobleck is a prose work, like its predecessor. Geisel said he drew inspiration for the book from a conversation he overheard while stationed in Belgium during World War II. During a rainstorm, one of his fellow soldiers remarked, \\"Rain, always rain. Why can't we have something different for a change?\\"Thomas Fensch. The Man Who Was Dr. Seuss. New Century Books, 2001. 95. The book was named a Caldecott Honor Book in 1950.Caldecott Medal & Honor Books, 1938-Present American Library Association  Plot  The book opens with an explanation of how people in the Kingdom of Didd still talk about \\"The year the King got angry with the sky,\\" and how Bartholomew Cubbins, King Derwin's page boy, saved the kingdom. Throughout the year, Bartholomew sees the king getting angry at rain in spring, sun in summer, fog in autumn, and snow in winter because he wants something new to come down from the sky. The king gets the idea that he can rule the sky, and he orders Bartholomew to summon the Royal Magicians from their \\"musty hole beneath the dungeon.\\" When the king expresses his wish, the magicians announce that they can make oobleck, which will not look anything at all like the regular weather. That evening, the magicians make that substance at their mystic mountain Neeka-tave, and release it into the air. Next morning, Bartholomew sees droplets of a strange green substance falling from the sky: the oobleck has arrived. When the King sees it, he is overjoyed. He declares the day a holiday and orders Bartholomew to tell the Royal Bell Ringer to announce the occasion. The bell ringer tries to oblige, but the bell will not ring; the oobleck is falling harder and turns out to be both gelatinous and adhesive, and it has gummed up the bell. When Bartholomew sees a mother bird trapped in her nest by the oobleck, and a cow trapped in the oobleck, he makes the decision to warn the kingdom. The Royal Trumpeter tries to sound the alarm, but oobleck gets into the trumpet and the trumpeter gets his hand stuck trying to remove it. Bartholomew tells the Captain of the Guard to warn the kingdom, but the captain, determined to prove that he's not afraid of the oobleck, scoops some up with his sword and eats it, only to get his mouth stuck and breathe out green bubbles. Bartholomew decides to warn the kingdom himself and rushes to the Royal Stables for a horse, but, perhaps predictably, all the horses have been covered and immobilized by oobleck. In the throne room, the king, now swathed in oobleck, orders Bartholomew to summon the magicians to stop the storm, but Bartholomew delivers the bad news that \\"their cave on Mountain Neeka-tave is buried deep in oobleck.\\" The king gets the idea to use the magicians' magic words (\\"Shuffle Duffle Muzzle Muff...\\") to stop the oobleck, but he cannot remember the whole incantation, and, in any case, he is not a magician. Bartholomew finally gets the courage to reprimand the king for making such a foolish wish, and he tells him to use simple words, like \\"I'm sorry,\\" instead of magic words. Immediately after the king says those simple words, the oobleck storm abates and the sun melts away all the green slime, freeing everybody. After the oobleck is gone, Bartholomew takes the king to the bell tower. The king rings the bell proclaiming the day a holiday, dedicated not to oobleck, but to rain, sun, fog, and snow, the four things that have always, and should always, come down from the sky. A version recorded by the actor Marvin Miller varies slightly from the book: the king first encounters the oobleck in his royal bathtub, when it comes out of the water faucet, causing him to become stuck. Also, Bartholomew encounters Gussie, the royal cook, who is in panic with what he sees.

After retiring as a player, Foley served as an on-field coach for the Tampa Bay Rays, from through , when he moved into the team's front office. Early years Foley was born in Columbus, Georgia. His father was in the U.S. Army so he moved a lot in his childhood. When he was growing up he lived in France, Hawaii, and Japan for four years. Foley graduated from Miami Palmetto High School, where he played both football, basketball and baseball. After high school, Foley played baseball at Dade South Community College until the Cincinnati Reds drafted him in the 7th round of the 1977 amateur draft. Playing career At age 23, Foley made his major league debut on April 9, 1983. In his first start 8 days later, he had a walk and a 2-run double in the first inning before even taking the field. During the 1985 season, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Alan Knicely and a player to be named later (Freddie Toliver) for Bo Diaz and Greg Simpson. Projected as the Phillies' starting shortstop in 1986, he was hit by a pitch in spring training and wound up playing sparingly (but well) behind the incumbent, Steve Jeltz. On July 24, 1986, Foley was traded to the Montreal Expos along with Lary Sorensen for Skeeter Barnes and Dan Schatzeder. As an Expo, Foley played regularly as a utility infielder over the next three seasons, attaining personal bests in games played (127 in 1988), batting average (.293 in 1987), slugging percentage (.432 in 1987), runs scored (35 in 1987), home runs (7 in 1989), and RBI (43 in 1988). While his playing time diminished over his remaining time in Montreal, his utility role expanded as he played all four infield positions during each of the 1990-1992 seasons. Prior to the 1993 season Foley signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he continued to serve as a part-time player/utility infielder for two seasons. He returned to Montreal for the 1995 season, but played sparingly and retired after being released on July 26, 1995. All of Foley's 13 seasons were played in the National League, and he was never part of a team that reached the postseason. A natural left-hander, he fielded/threw right- handed because as a youngster he first played baseball with his father's right-hander's glove. Foley credited his versatility afield for his longevity. \\"I really wasn't a great player, but I was an average major league player who did the little things. I played all of the infield positions and did what I was supposed to do. They say there are glove guys, and I was a glove guy. I could catch the ball and throw the ball, and I tried to mix in as many hits as I could.\\" Fielding metrics back that up‚Äîover his career, Foley compiled above league-average range factors at both second and third base, and average range factors at shortstop. When asked what stood out to him about his 13 seasons in the majors, he responded, \\"Probably just making it to the major leagues.\\" Post-playing/coaching career After his retirement as a player, Foley was hired in 1996 by the expansion Tampa Bay Rays as a minor league field coordinator. Following the team's initial June amateur draft, he oversaw the first mini camp in club history. During the summer of 1996, Foley also managed the Rays' Rookie level team in Butte, Montana. He led the Copper Kings to a 37-35 record and was named the Pioneer League's Manager of the Year. After four years as field coordinator, Foley became the Rays' director of minor league operations in 2000. He also managed an Arizona Fall League team, the Maryvale Saguaros, in 2001. Foley was hired by the Tampa Bay Rays to be their third base coach on October 25, 2001, and served in that role through the 2014 season, working under Hal McRae, Lou Piniella and Joe Maddon. During his 13 years as the third base coach, he waved home 9,418 runs, or 77% of the 12,215 runs scored in club history to that point. On December 19, 2014, the Rays announced that Foley would move into the dugout to serve as new manager Kevin Cash's bench coach. On October 2, 2017, the Rays announced Foley left the bench coach role in a mutual agreement and would be taking another role with the team. He is the longest-tenured coach in Rays history. Personal life Foley is American of Japanese descent. He married Marta Wright on August 28, 1981, and they have three children together, Bryan, Brett and Brooke.

Like The Cat in the Hat, or the more political Yertle the Turtle, If I Ran the Circus develops a theme of cumulative fantasy leading to excess. The overt social commentary found in the Sneetches and the Zax demonstrates that Dr. Seuss was fascinated by the errors and excesses to which humans are prone, and If I Ran the Circus also examines this interest, though more subtly and comically, given its earlier genesis. Plot overview Behind Mr. Sneelock's ramshackle store, there's an empty lot. Little Morris McGurk is convinced that if he could just clear out the rusty cans, the dead tree, and the old cars, nothing would prevent him from using the lot for the amazing, world-beating, Circus McGurkus. The more elaborate Morris' dreams about the circus become, the more they depend on the sleepy-looking and innocent Sneelock, who stands outside his ramshackle store sucking on a pipe, oblivious to the fate that awaits him in the depths of Morris's imagination. Sneelock does not yet know that he will have to dispense 500 gallons of lemonade, be lassoed by a Wily Walloo, wrestle a Grizzly-Ghastly, and ski down a slope dotted with giant cacti. But if his performance is up to McGurkian expectations, then \\"Why, ladies and gentlemen, youngsters and oldsters, your heads will quite likely spin right off your shouldsters!\\" And Sneelock won't mind it one bit because he likes to help out.

Although born in England, he was never selected to play for them on an international level; he instead played for Scotland, for whom he was eligible due to his Scottish grandmother. He captained Leicester to victory in the 2000 Football League Cup Final scoring both goals. Club career Elliott began his career in non- league football with Leatherhead and Epsom & Ewell, before getting his first taste of professional football with Charlton Athletic. Unable to break into the Charlton first-team, he moved to Torquay United within a year. He then worked his way up the ladder, signing for Scunthorpe United in March 1992, moving on to Oxford United in November 1993, and finally getting his chance in the Premiership when he was signed by Leicester City in early 1997 for a transfer fee of ¬£1.6 million. This remained the record for a sale by Oxford until 2016, when Kemar Roofe moved to Leeds United. He was cup-tied for their victory in the 1997 Football League Cup Final. Elliott became a mainstay in a Leicester side that surprised many in the top flight, and also performed well in cup competitions. The defender became synonymous with The Foxes' bruising style of play that made them one of the hardest sides to play in the Premiership. Elliott sometimes courted controversy with his discipline throughout his time at Leicester, but remained a key player under both Martin O'Neill and his successor Peter Taylor. Elliott was influential in Leicester's run to the 2000 Football League Cup Final, and their victory in the game itself. He scored the only goal of the two-legged semi final against Aston Villa and then scored both goals in the final as Leicester beat Tranmere Rovers 2-1. When Martin O'Neill left to manage Celtic in July 2000, he made an attempt to lure Elliott to the club in a ¬£3.5 million bid (O'Neill would raid his former club for the likes of Neil Lennon and Steve Guppy). It was unsuccessful when Elliott signed the last contract of his career in August 2001, which would last until June 2005. Elliott's made his last European appearance in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade in Vienna on 28 September 2000 in the 2001 UEFA Cup. He had a loan spell at Ipswich Town before his retirement. His final season was thwarted by a knee injury and, after making only three appearances, Elliott retired from football in January 2005. International career Elliott won 18 caps for the Scotland national team, scoring one goal which was a header from an Allan Johnston cross in a 2‚Äì0 win against San Marino. He made 16 starts and two appearances from the bench, including his debut against France in November 1997. He was in the Scotland squad for the 1998 World Cup although he did not appear in any of the games. After retirement =Coaching= On 9 June 2008, Elliott was unveiled as the new assistant manager to former Torquay teammate Dean Edwards at Northern Premier League team Hednesford Town. After a season that saw the Pitmen finish just outside the play-offs, Elliott stepped down from his position at Keys Park in May 2009 to concentrate on other business interests. He then became assistant manager of Midland Alliance side Oadby Town, until in October 2010 he became assistant manager of Conference North club Stafford Rangers, working under Tim Flowers. Elliott was appointed manager after Flowers resigned from his managerial role on 11 January 2011. In January 2014, Elliott became manager of Thailand Premier League side Army United, a club affiliated with Elliott's former club, Leicester City. Elliott left Army United in June 2014 with the side in 11th place, in order to take up a role with Leicester City. In September 2015 De Montfort University announced that Elliott had been appointed first team coach for the University's men's and women's teams. =Media= In August 2014, Elliott took over as an analyst for BBC Radio Leicester.

NS&I; sets interest rates both to attract savers and provide low-cost finance for the government, and 100% of any individual's savings are guaranteed by HM Treasury; rules are in place to ensure that it does not offer market-leading products that would stifle competition. Operations NS&I;'s head office is in Pimlico, London, with operational sites in Blackpool, Glasgow, Birkenhead and Durham. However, its entire back office operation is contracted out to a French company, Atos Global IT Solutions and Services, who use a site in Chennai, India. NS&I; first outsourced out its operations in 1999 to Siemens Business Services; some 4,000 staff were transferred to Siemens, leaving 130 NS&I; staff responsible for the design, management and marketing of products, and managing the relationship with Siemens. A 2000 report by the National Audit Office stated that the contract was better value than keeping the operations in-house, and suggested other government departments could learn from the way this public-private partnership was procured and managed. The Siemens business unit was acquired by Atos in 2011. In the past the bank offered many of its services through post offices, but in November 2011 it was announced that most products would only be available by telephone, online, or by post; Premium Bonds would be the only remaining product sold in post offices. From 1 August 2015, NS&I; stopped selling Premium Bonds through post offices, and became a purely direct business.

The celebration includes fantastical and colorful gifts, foods and a whirl of activities all arranged by the Birthday Bird for the reader's birthday. It focuses on the reader's self-actualization and concludes with the happy and exhausted reader falling blissfully asleep.

It is usually used in English as a setting for William Williams' text Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer (or, in some traditions, Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah),John Richard Watson, An Annotated Anthology of Hymns Published 2002, Oxford University Press p. 228. \\"Hymns Ancient and Modern and the English Hymnal have always printed Guide me, O thou great redeemer, as the first line.\\" originally (\\"Lord, lead me through the wilderness\\") in Welsh. The tune and hymn are often called Bread of Heaven because of a repeated line in this English translation. In Welsh the tune is most commonly used as a setting for a hymn by Ann Griffiths, (\\"Lo, between the myrtles standing\\"). Tune Capel Rhondda, Hopkinstown John Hughes wrote the first version of the tune, which he called \\"Rhondda\\", for the Cymanfa Ganu (hymn festival) in Pontypridd in 1905, when the enthusiasm of the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival still remained.\\"Caniadau'r Diwygiad\\", Noel Gibbard, 2003, The present form was developed for the inauguration of the organ at Capel Rhondda, in Hopkinstown in the Rhondda Valley, in 1907. Hughes himself played the organ at this performance, using the English translation of William Williams' words perhaps because of the large number of English-speaking industrial workers who had migrated to the area. The name was changed from \\"Rhondda\\" to \\"Cwm Rhondda\\" by Harry Evans, of Dowlais, to avoid confusion with another tune, by M O Jones. John Owen-Jones singing 'Bread of Heaven' The hymn is usually pitched in A-flat major and has the 8.7.8.7.4.7 measure which is common in Welsh hymns. The third line repeats the first and the fourth line develops the second. The fifth line normally involves a repeat of the four-syllable text and the sixth reaches a climax on a dominant seventh chord (bar 12) ‚Äì emphasised by a rising arpeggio in the alto and bass parts. The final line continues the musical development of the second and fourth (and generally carries a repeat of the text of the sixth). On account of these vigorous characteristics, the tune was resisted for some time in both Welsh and English collections but has long been firmly established.\\"Welsh Hymns and their Tunes\\", Alan Luff, 1990, pp223-4 Hymn text: 'Guide me, O Thou great Redeemer' =Present-day= The following are the English and Welsh versions of the hymn, as given in the standard modern collections. The Welsh version shown above is a somewhat literal re-translation from the English version back into Welsh. Earlier versions of the hymn book published jointly by the Calvinist and Wesleyan Methodists had a version with five verses (i.e. omitting verse two of the six given in the History section below) that was otherwise much closer to Pantycelyn's original Welsh text. =History= William Williams Pantycelyn (named, in the Welsh style, \\"Pantycelyn\\" after the farm which his wife inherited) is generally acknowledged as the greatest Welsh hymnwriter.'Welsh Hymns and their Tunes', Alan Luff, 1990, pp102-3 The Welsh original of this hymn was first published as Hymn 10 in Mor o Wydr (Sea of Glass) in 1762. It comprised six verses.'Emynau a'u Hawduriaid', John Thickens, 1927, Llyfrfa'r Methodistiaid Calvinaidd (References to a five verse version in Pantycelyn's Alleluia of 1745 appear to be incorrect.) It was originally titled Gweddi am Nerth i fyned trwy anialwch y Byd (Prayer for strength for the journey through the world's wilderness). Peter Williams (1722‚Äì1796) translated part of the hymn into the English version given above, with the title Prayer for Strength. It was published in Hymns on various subjects, 1771. This translation is the only Welsh hymn to have gained widespread circulation in the English-speaking world.'Welsh Hymns and their Tunes', Alan Luff, 1990, p130 The present-day Welsh version, given above, is essentially a redaction of the original to parallel Peter Williams's English version. A result of the translation process is that the now-familiar phrase \\"Bread of heaven\\" does not actually occur in the original; it is a paraphrase of the references to manna. The Welsh word Arglwydd corresponds more-or-less to the English Lord, in all its senses. It appears in the Old Testament to translate Hebrew words which are a paraphrase of the Divine Name (the tetragrammaton), and in the New Testament to translate Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ (kyrios), the standard honorific for Jesus Christ. Accordingly, Peter Williams translated it as Jehovah in accord with the practice of his time. Many English-language hymnals today translate it as \\"Redeemer\\". The following version of the original is taken from Gwaith Pantycelyn (The Works of Pantycelyn).'Gwaith Pantycelyn', Gomer M Roberts, 1960, Gwasg Aberystwyth All but the second verse is given, with minor variations, in the Welsh Hymnbook of the Calvinist and Wesleyan Methodists, published by the assemblies of the two churches. (The variations are mainly to update the language, e.g. in verse 1 ynwyf (elided to ynwy), meaning \\"in [me]\\", has become ynof in more modern Welsh.) =Meanings= The hymn describes the experience of God's people in their travel through the wilderness from the escape from slavery in Egypt (), being guided by a cloud by day and a fire by night () to their final arrival forty years later in the land of Canaan (). During this time their needs were supplied by God, including the daily supply of manna (). The hymn text forms an allegory for the journey of a Christian throughout their life on earth requiring the Redeemer's guidance and ending at the gates of Heaven (the verge of Jordan) and end of time (death of death and hell's destruction). =Instances of use= The hymn has been sung on various British state occasions, such as the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton and of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The hymn is also featured prominently in the soundtrack to the 1941 film How Green Was My Valley, directed by John Ford. The soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, won that year's Academy Award for Original Music Score. It is also featured at the beginning of The African Queen (film), with Katharine Hepburn singing and playing the organ. Only Men Aloud! also sang an arrangement by Tim Rhys-Evans and Jeffrey Howard on the BBC 1 Show Last Choir Standing in 2008. They subsequently released it on their self-titled d√©but album. The hymn was the informal anthem of Wales in the \\"Green and Pleasant Land\\" section of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave used this song on the episode \\"The Beast In The Cage\\". The lyrics were altered to be about the main character Victor Meldrew. Hymn text: 'Wele'n sefyll rhwng y myrtwydd' Despite the history of the tune and its common English text, the usual tune- words pairing in Welsh is quite different. Arglwydd, arwain... is usually sung to the tune Capel y Dd√¥l'Caneuon Ffydd', 2001, , Hymn 702, Tune 576 and Cwm Rhondda is the setting for the hymn Wele'n Sefyll Rwng y Myrtwydd by Ann Griffiths: Other English hymn texts Some hymnals use this tune for the hymn God of Grace and God of Glory written by Harry Emerson Fosdick in 1930. Others for Full salvation! Full salvation! Lo, the fountain opened wide by Francis Bottome (1823‚Äì94). Legacy In 2007 dignitaries from Pontypridd Town Council unveiled a plaque at Capel Rhondda in Hopkinstown, Pontypridd, to celebrate the centenary of the hymn's composition. Minister Rev Phil Rickards said: \\"This is where the tune was first publicly performed.\\" A service celebrating the centenary was also held at John Hughes' burial place, Salem Baptist Chapel in nearby Tonteg. =Rugby= Apart from church use, probably its best known use is as the 'Welsh Rugby Hymn', often sung by the crowd at rugby matches, especially those of the Wales national rugby union team. There it is common for all voices to sing the repeat of the last three syllables of the last-but-one line, e.g. \\"want no more\\" or \\"strength and shield\\" (which in church use is repeated only in the bass and alto parts, if at all). =Football= From the second half of the 20th century, English and Scottish football fans used often to sing a song based on this tune using the words \\"We'll support you evermore\\", which in turn led to many different versions being adapted. , the variation \\"You're Not Singing Any More\\" when taunting the fans of opposing teams who are losing remains extremely popular.

The story centers on the activity of sleep as readers follow the journey of many different characters preparing to slip into a deep slumber. This book documents the different sleeping activities that some of the creatures join in on: Jo and Mo Redd-Joff participate in competitive sleep talking and a group ‚Äúnear Finnigan Fen‚Äù enjoys group sleepwalking. It opens with a small bug, named Van Vleck, yawning. This single yawn sets off a chain reaction, effectively putting ‚Äúninety-nine zillion nine trillion and two‚Äù creatures to sleep.  Summary  The book is written in the style of a reporter on the news who is reporting on the number of sleepers in the world. The book starts with a \\"very small bug\\" named Van Vleck yawning. The narrator then tells the reader that this is very important news and goes on to explain that a yawn is contagious and will cause sleep across the countryside. The narrator then takes us around the world to various locations where people are going to sleep, such as Herk-Heimer Falls, the Castle of Krupp, and the towns of Culppeper Springs and Mercedd. Various silly groups of people go to sleep together, such as a \\"Hinkle Horn Honking Club.\\" Various creatures go to sleep too, such as a Collapsible Frink and the Chippendale Mupp. The narrator explains that they count the number of people and creatures asleep using an \\"Audio Telly O-Tally O-Count\\" which spies on people to know when they went to bed. The narrator then explores the latest news in the sports of sleeptalking and sleepwalking before returning to the previous standard of discussing various locations (such as the Zwieback Motel and the District of Dofft) and creatures (such as the Foona Lagoona Baboona and a Jedd. Then the book explains that \\"Ninety Nine Zillion, Nine Trillion and Two\\" creatures are asleep and then asks \\"What about you?\\" The final line of the book is a \\"Good night,\\" which is unmetered.  Background  Theodor Seuss Geisel, more popularly known as Dr. Seuss, published his first children‚Äôs book in 1937 after it was rejected 27 times by publisher.s His first big success, Cat in the Hat, occurred in 1957; it was instantly received well and was regarded with praise. From there, Dr. Seuss went on to write 45 books for children‚Äôs literature including The Lorax, Green Eggs and Ham, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, and Oh, The Places You'll Go!. Dr. Seuss‚Äôs Sleep Book was his 21st children‚Äôs book, following The Sneetches and Other Stories in 1961 and preceding Dr. Seuss's ABC in 1963.  Genre  Similarly to his other books, Dr. Seuss‚Äôs Sleep Book is a fictional book classified under children‚Äôs literature and characterized by its rhythmic sequence. His illustrations are known to depict a wide variety of unique creatures and odd relationships. Dr. Seuss uses his standard red yellow and turquoise colors, only deviating from this pattern to add hints of purple and one orange Moose Juice alongside a green Goose Juice.  Analysis  The Sleep Book sets a good example for young kids on the proper hygiene methods used before bedtime such as brushing their teeth, putting their things away, and making sure their alarm is set for the morning. It has also popularly been used in Pre-K through Grade 1 to help kids with the pronunciation of their ‚Äúsl‚Äù sounds. Throughout this story, Dr. Seuss introduces his young audience to a number of sleep related habits and activities: dreaming, sleep talking, sleep walking, yawing, and snoring. The book specifically indicates that it must be ‚Äúread in bed‚Äù because of its ability to put kids to sleep.  Reception  Parents have praised Dr. Seuss‚Äôs Sleep Book for its soothing rhythmic element that helps their children fall asleep. This children‚Äôs book is said to be a top choice for parents to read to their kids at night due to its soothing rhythm and ‚Äútimeless story‚Äù. Additionally, Verlo reviewed Dr. Seuss‚Äôs Sleep Book, commenting on its ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù methods that effectively put children to sleep calmly and easily. One article praised Dr. Seuss‚Äôs ability to write to the younger audience ‚Äúwithout condescension‚Äù and reasoned this factor to be his backing for such great success. During Read Across America Week, organizations such as the CPSD celebrate Dr. Seuss Day by reading The Sleep Book.  Changes from Earlier Drafts  Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book went through several iterations before the final draft was cemented. In an early draft, the County of Keck was named the County of Teck and Van Vleck, Van Geck . In another draft, the book included a stanza which reads In another draft, the narrator is from \\"The Nightly News about just who's taking their nightly snooze.\\"  Book Information  Format: Hardcover Category: Juvenile Fiction - Bedtime & DreamsJuvenile Fiction - Bedtime & DreamsJuvenile Fiction - Stories In Verse Author: Dr. Seuss Also Available: Also available as an eBook.

The story features classic Seuss rhymes and drawings in his distinctive pen and ink style. The book is a first-person narrative told by a young narrator who experiences troubles in his life (mostly aggressive small animals that bite and sting) and wishes to escape them. He sets out for the city of Solla Sollew (\\"where they never have troubles / at least very few\\") and learns that he must face his problems instead of running away from them. He then goes back home to deal with his \\"troubles\\", arming himself with a big bat and resolving that \\"Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!\\" The journey includes several fantastic, and troublesome, encounters. In one instance, the protagonist is forced to haul a wagon for a bossy companion. (\\"'This is called teamwork. I furnish the brains. You furnish the muscles, the aches and the pains.'\\") In another scene, he is drafted into the army under the command of the fearsome (and, ultimately, cowardly) General Genghis Kahn Schmitz, who abandons him at a critical moment. Plot As the story opens, an unnamed protagonist (resembling a cat or dog) lives a happy and carefree life in the Valley of Vung, until one day he goes out for a stroll to look at daisies and hurts himself by tripping over a rock, setting off the troubles he will soon face. The protagonist vows to be more careful, but a Green-Headed Quilligan Quail bites his tail from behind. Worse still, a Skritz dives to sting his neck and a Skrink bites his toe, proving that troubles can come from every direction. As the protagonist tries to fight off his troubles, a man on a One-Wheeler Wubble drawn by a camel comes up and explains that like the protagonist, he too is experiencing a troubled life and has decided to escape his troubles by going to Solla Sollew, a city on the beautiful banks of the river Wah-Hoo, and never known to have troubles (at least very few). He invites the protagonist to come along with him. Eager to escape from his troubles, the protagonist joins the Wubble driver, but after a long night of traveling, the camel gets sick and starts to bubble. At first, the driver and protagonist pull him on the Wubble, but for the rest of the day, the driver acts lazy and the protagonist has to do all the hard work. The next day, they thankfully discover a camel doctor named Dr. Sam Snell, who diagnoses their camel with a bad case of gleeks and orders him to go to bed for at least twenty weeks. The driver makes it up to the protagonist by telling him he can catch the 4:42 bus to Solla Sollew at the nearest bus stop, but when the protagonist gets to the bus stop he learns from a notice letter tacked on a stick and written by the bus line president, Horace P. Sweet, that the 4:42 Solla Sollew bound bus is out of service because the driver, Butch Myers, apparently destroyed all his tires from accidentally running over four nails...\\"But,\\" adds Horace P. Sweet, \\"I wish you a most pleasant journey by feet.\\" So the protagonist now has no choice but to hike to Solla Sollew. After hiking a hundred miles, the poor protagonist is caught in a rainstorm. A kindly stranger tells him that the storm is the infamous \\"Midwinter Jicker\\" and allows the protagonist to take shelter in his house (where a family of mice and a family of owls also happen to be taking shelter) while he escapes the Midwinter Jicker to stay at his grandfather's house in Palm Springs. After a sleepless night and dreaming of sleeping in Solla Sollew, the protagonist awakens to find that the flood-waters have washed the house over a cliff, leaving him still trapped inside. He spends twelve days in the flood-waters, until somebody rescues him by throwing down a rope. The protagonist climbs the rope, only to discover that his savior is none other than General Genghis Kahn Schmitz, who immediately drafts him into his army for an upcoming battle against a lion-like creature known as the Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass and arms him with only a shooter and a little bean. At the pass, the General and his army catch sight of a poozer and charge ahead to certain victory...only to discover that they are outnumbered by several Poozers and General Genghis Kahn Schmitz orders an immediate retreat without fighting, leaving the protagonist to face the Poozers alone, armed with nothing but \\"a shooter and one little bean\\" and wondering to himself if he'll ever get through to Solla Sollew. The protagonist has a hard time escaping the pursuing Poozers until he comes upon an air vent marked \\"Vent No. 5\\", and escapes them by diving into the vent...only to end up in a dark tunnel network negotiating heavy traffic of strange birds, all going in the wrong direction, for three days, injuring and starving himself and even growing moss on his feet due to the dampness of the tunnels! By the end of the third day, he finally finds a door and discovers he's come out at the beautiful banks of the river Wah-Hoo. Realizing he's reached his goal, the protagonist rushes out to Solla Sollew. At the gates of Solla Sollew, the protagonist is greeted by a friendly doorman. The doorman explains to the protagonist about one trouble the city has: a key-slapping Slippard who's taken charge of the city by moving into the lock of the only door into Solla Sollew \\"two weeks ago Tuesday at quarter to four,\\" and is known to cause trouble by repeatedly slapping the key out of the keyhole whenever the doorman tries to insert it, thus keeping anyone from entering the city. Because killing a Slippard is considered bad luck, the doorman can do nothing to evict this pest. Therefore, he has no choice but to resign his doorman job and leave Solla Sollew for the city of Boola Boo Ball on the banks of the beautiful river Woo-Wall, where troubles are never known to exist (\\"No troubles at all!\\"), and invites the protagonist to come along. At first, the protagonist considers joining the doorman, but realizing that he's come all this way for nothing, he has no choice but to go back home to the Valley of Vung and have to deal with his troubles. He recognizes that he will have at least some troubles for the rest of his life, but at least now, he's ready to face them. Armed with nothing but a baseball bat, the protagonist now gives the rocks, Quail, Skritz, and Skrink their own troubles (\\"But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready, you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!\\"). In Seussical In Seussical, the character of General Genghis Kahn Schmitz makes an appearance as a secondary character. He introduces JoJo to the military school in song. This sets up a subplot concerning JoJo in which he is thought to be lost in battle. The character of Schmitz in the play is a cross between the Schmitz seen in the book and the unnamed generals in the Butter Battle Book. Solla Sollew is the subject of a song in which the main characters yearn for a happy resolution to their problems. It is referred to as \\"a faraway land, so the stories all tell / somewhere beyond the horizon.\\" It is said that \\"troubles there are few\\" and that \\"maybe it's something like heaven.\\" Solla Sollew is believed to be a place of hope and wonder, where \\"breezes are warm\\" and \\"people are kind.\\" It is a dream of the characters to find this incredible place, where they will find each other and be happy once and for all. However, they cannot ever find it, saying in the song \\"when I get close, it disappears\\".

By 1942 he fled to Romania and after the end of the Second World War he was sentenced by the Special Traitor's Courts in Greece to death. In Romania he was jailed by the new Communist government and died there in 1948. From Samarina to Bucharest Alcibiades Diamandi was born in 1894, in Samarina, into a wealthy Aromanian (Vlach) family. He studied at the Greek Gymnasium in Siatista, continuing his studies in Romania where he became involved in the Aromanian separatist movement. During the course of World War I he served as a non-commissioned officer in the Greek army. In 1917, he formed an armed Aromanian separatist band that operated in the Pindus mountains, then part of the Italian protectorate over Albania. With the tacit approval of the Italian authorities he proclaimed the foundation of the Principality of the Pindus centered in Samarina, with himself as prince. Following a diplomatic protest by Greece, Italian troops departed from Epirus as did Diamandi who was charged with sedition. Returning to Romania in the early 1920s he entered the Romanian diplomatic service and was appointed consul at Sarand√´ in order to influence the local Vlach population. It is believed that in 1925 he became an agent of the Italian intelligence services. Diamandi's involvement in illegal economic activities led to his removal from the Romanian diplomatic corp. In 1927, Diamandi received a pardon from the Greek government. The Athens years Shortly after the presumed amnesty, he arrived in Athens as the \\"vice president of the National Petroleum Company of Romania\\", as an oil importer. This was coupled with importing lumber from Romania to Greece and some other business ventures. He rented a flat in the fashionable Kolonaki district, and frequented the bars and cafes of Piraeus, where he was involved in a brawl with a Greek navy captain. During the squabble, Diamandi was wounded by a bottle flung in his direction by his adversary, and the resulting scar was used to identify him later on when he was on the run. Diamandi frequently traveled to Rhodes (which was at the time an Italian possession), managing to attract the attention of the Greek Counter-intelligence Services. It is widely assumed that the Greek government was aware that Diamandi was an undercover Romanian agent who was trying to incite the Aromanians against the Greek state. During Ioannis Metaxas's regime, Diamandi was served with an expulsion order, but he managed to avoid being forced out and continued his activities. World War II When the Greco-Italian War started, at the end of October 1940, Diamandi was already in Konitsa on the Albanian-Greek border. The invading Italians offered him the rank of Commendatore, and he served as translator and assistant to the Italian Chief of Staff General Alfredo Guzzoni. After Italy's initial defeat, Diamandi was forced to seek refuge in Tirana (at that time under Italian rule) and re- entered Greece with the Italian armies five months later in the spring of 1941. This time he discussed a so-called \\"Autonomous State of the Pindus\\" (ŒëœÖœÑœåŒΩŒøŒºŒøŒΩ ŒöœÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ†ŒØŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÖ) or \\"Autonomous Vlach State\\" (ŒëœÖœÑœåŒΩŒøŒºŒøŒΩ ŒíŒªŒ±œáŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒöœÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ) in the territory of Epirus, Thessaly and parts of Macedonia, which was supposed to constitute a \\"Vlach Homeland\\". This planned state or canton is sometimes called \\"Principality of Pindus\\" (the name used to mainly refer to the events in Pindus in August 1917). Diamandi's deputy and right-hand was the Larissa-based lawyer Nicolaos Matussis, while the third in the hierarchy of the nascent state was Rapoutikas Vassilis. In June 1941, Diamandi found himself in Grevena and then he went to Metsovo, where he founded the \\"Party of the KŒøutso-Vlach Community\\" (ŒöœåŒºŒºŒ± ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ ŒöŒøœÖœÑœÉŒøŒ≤ŒªŒ¨œáœâŒΩ) which was part of the \\"Union of Romanian Communities\\" (ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ Œ°ŒøœÖŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒöŒøŒπŒΩŒøœÑŒÆœÑœâŒΩ). A \\"Vlach Parliament\\" was summoned in Trikala, but no laws were adopted--since the meeting was mostly for show; the Italians were not keen on sharing power in the region.  A Vlach Manifesto in occupied Greece  On March 1, 1942, Diamandi issued an ample Manifesto which was published in the local press and republished by Stavros Anthemides in 1997 (in his book on the Vlachs of Greece; see bibliography). The Manifesto was co-signed by leading Aromanians (Vlachs) intellectuals such as: * the lawyer Nicolaos Matussi * Prof. Dimas Tioutras * the lawyer Vasilakis Georgios * the physician Dr. Frangkos Georgios * the teacher A. Beca * the businessman Gachi Papas * the physician Dr. Nikos Mitsibouna * Prof. Dim. Hatzigogou * the lawyer A. Kalometros * the engineer Niko Teleionis * Vasilis Tsiotzios * Prof. Kosta Nicoleskou * Prof. Toli Pasta * Dim. Tahas * Prof. Stefanos Kotsios * Prof. G. Kontoinani * Dr. Kaloera * Prof. Toli Hatzi * Giovani Mertzios of Neveska (whose son Nik. Merztios, in a twist of history, is a well known pro-Greek Vlach author of Greece) * Pericli Papas * Prof. Virgiliu Balamace (related to Nick Balamace, currently the Secretary of the 'Society Farsarotul' in the United States) * ing. S. Pelekis * K. Pitouli * the lawyer Toli Hatzis * Dim. Barba Two Vlachs of Albania and Bulgaria, Vasilis Vartolis and the Samarina-born writer Zicu Araia, also endorsed the Manifesto. In Romania, it was co-signed by the Veria-born George Murnu, a professor at the University of Bucharest. Diamandi travelled to Bucharest shortly after he met Murnu, and together they attended a meeting with the then Leader (ConducƒÉtor) of Romania Marshal Ion Antonescu, and the Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu. The status of the Principality of Pindos was discussed. One option favoured by Diamandi was to put the Principality under the sovereignty of the Romanian Crown (as an associated \\"free state\\"). Another option was to link the principality to the ruling Italian House of Savoy. None of these options were to be realised. Refuge in Romania Towards the second year of the Italian occupation, guerilla actions broke out in the area, between the Greek Resistance supported by the Allied Forces and the Italo- German side. The chaos that ensued drove Diamandi to leave (either that or he was ordered back) to Romania. Diamandi was arrested by the Romanian Communist Secret Service ‚ÄùSecuritate‚Äù on February 21, 1948. He died in the Prefecture of Police in Bucharest some months later supposedly under torture by Soviet Agent Mihail Dulgheru.http://www.ziarelive.ro/stiri/efectul-cazului-visinescu- procurorii-au-redeschis-dosarul-unui-alt-tortionar-al-securitatii-dupa-ce- gandul-a-relatat-despre-caz.html Matoussi escaped, first to Athens then to Romania too, while Rapoutikas was shot dead by one of the Greek factions involved in guerilla activities just outside Larissa (the Greeks then tied his corpse on the back a donkey and paraded him through the Vlach villages of the Pindus - this was intended in order to scare the local populace and as a final proof that the so-called Roman Legion had reached its end). Reception According to the German scholar Dr. Thede Kahl (see bibliography), Diamandi was for a while Kingdom of Romania's Consul in the Albanian port Vlor√´ just opposite across the strait of the Italian town of Otranto. Greek historians often do not mention him, while other scholars who give vague reference to him (such as or Mark Mazower) make sure that they clearly distance themselves from Diamandi hence bestowing upon him apelatives like \\"extremist\\" and \\"shameful\\". Alkiviadis Diamandi is given mention in 1995 by the British author Tim Salmon in his book about the Vlachs of Greece (see bibliography) as follows: :A pro- Mussolini teacher called Dhiamantis who returned to Samarina during the Occupation and tried to set up a fascist Vlach state the Principality of Pindus. It is possible that the idea of autonomy struck a chord in some nationalistic Vlach breasts but they certainly were not the collaborators he accused them of being. The author finds the precedents of Diamandi's movement in the Vlachs' desire of separateness, which he sees as a sign of \\"strength\\". He writes: :Up to the 1920s the Vlakholoi - the Vlach clan as it were- had been so strong that the government could not really interfere with them. There had been Romanian schools (financed from Romania from around the Treaty of Berlin in 1881 which forced the Turks to cede Thessaly to Greece, drawing the frontier through Metsovo and thus dividing the Greek Vlachdom in Yannina, Thessaloniki and Grevena up until 1940. In fact, there was one in Samarina itself.

It is probably derived from the English bawdy folk song \\"The Chandler's Wife\\", which in turn derived its tune from the earlier English folk song \\"The Lincolnshire Poacher\\". The song was recorded by Phil Harris on October 13, 1950, and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3968. The record first reached the Billboard charts on November 17, 1950. It lasted 14 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 1. . Other versions were recorded by Arthur Godfrey, The Ames Brothers, Danny Kaye, Kidsongs, Ray Charles, Teresa Brewer, Adam Westhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hcj_yzD27A, and Australian orchestra leader Les Welch. The Arthur Godfrey recording was made in November 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39068. The Danny Kaye recording was made on December 1, 1950, and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27350. The Ray Charles recording was made on July 13, 1963, and released by ABC-Paramount Records on the album Have a Smile with Me, as catalog number ABC 495 (mono) / ABCS 495 (stereo). The Teresa Brewer recording was made in October 1950, and released by London Records as catalog number 873. The Les Welch recording was made in January 1951 and released by Pacific Records, an Australian company, as catalog number 10-0051. Bill Buchanan recorded a cover version, which featured his voice sounding like a chipmunk in a fast track vocal. Story The lyrics take the form of a first-person narration, describing the discovery on a beach of a large, wooden box, that is floating in the bay, which he pulls it out of the water. Whatever is in the box is never revealed, nor is it called \\"The Thing\\" in the lyrics. When the lyrics call for The Thing to be named, the vocals simply pause for three percussive knocks. For example, the first verse ends, \\"I discovered a [* **], right before my eyes!\\" (The knocks [* **] are unequally spaced, occurring on counts 1,3 and 4 of the song's 6/8 meter. The listener could substitute any three-syllable phrase their imagination might suggest, such as \\"dog-gone thing\\".) The narrator is overjoyed by a discovery that repels seemingly everyone else in this world (and the next). He takes the box into a pawnshop in his neighborhood, hoping to sell it, but is thrown out by the proprietor with a threat to call the police. \\"Running for [his] life,\\" the narrator takes the box home to his wife, who also kicks him out--and orders him never to return (possibly until he gets rid of it). Next, the narrator offers the box to a hobo, receiving first his assurance that he'll take \\"most any old thing,\\" as he is desperate; but when the homeless man sees what's in the box, he runs away. The hapless narrator proceeds through the rest of his life unable to rid himself of the Thing, until he dies and arrives at the gates of Heaven, still with the box, only to be ordered by Saint Peter to \\"take it down below\\" (that is, to Hell). The song closes with the narrator's warning not to open a tempting box found on the beach as he did, or \\"you'll never get rid of the [* **], no matter what ya do!\\" Film The song aired on radio concurrently with a series of teaser ads which ran weekly in Collier's promoting Howard Hawks' science fiction movie, The Thing from Another World (released April 6, 1951). While the song had no connection with the movie, some suspect it was a clever marketing tool to increase interest in seeing the film. Harris performed the song in the film The Wild Blue Yonder (1951). A portion of the Phil Harris version was played during the indoor swimming pool scene in the Peter Bogdanovich film The Last Picture Show (1971). In science fiction Edward G. Robles, Jr. wrote a short science fiction story partially based around the song. It involved several homeless men who find an item like the one described in the song. In the story, the item is discovered to be an alien disguised as something nobody wants. It was originally copyrighted by Galaxy Publishing Corp. in 1954. Pinball Chicago Coin made a pinball game in 1951 called THING with backglass and playfield art that got its inspiration from the song \\"The Thing\\". Roy Parker was the artist.

A catcher during his playing days, he appeared in 140 games over ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four clubs: the Atlanta Braves (1981‚Äì84), Oakland Athletics (1987‚Äì88), Detroit Tigers (1989) and Seattle Mariners (1990‚Äì92), and had a 15-year career as an MLB coach. Sinatro was listed as tall and ; he threw and batted right-handed. After graduating from Conard High School in West HartfordTampa Bay Devil Rays, he was selected by the Braves in the second round of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft. He was the 27th player chosen overall, 21 slots ahead of eventual Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, Jr. But offensive struggles (he batted only .245 during a 1,044-game minor league career) hindered Sinatro's development. He was never a regular player in the big leagues, nor did he play in more than 37 games in any MLB season. His 48 career big-league hits included six doubles, one triple, and one home run, a two-run blow off Pete Falcone of the New York Mets on August 27, 1982. The homer contributed to a 9‚Äì8 Atlanta victory in a year when the Braves prevailed over the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the National League West Division championship by a single game.Retrosheet box score: 1982-08-27 After drawing his release from the Mariners in October 1992, Sinatro was Seattle's MLB advance scout in 1993‚Äì94 before joining the big-league coaching staff of manager Lou Piniella.

The book is about the many amazing 'thinks' one can think and the endless possibilities and dreams that imagination can create. \\"Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!\\" is also the name of a song in the musical play Seussical, which is based partly on this book. Plot The book begins with a reader thinking about colors or animals that she knows, like birds, or horses, but as quickly as page three he asks the reader to think of something completely made up; a GUFF! A Guff is a sort of puffy fluff. Next he thinks up a dessert! Of all the made up things in this image the focus is on the dessert. Other than that it is beautiful and has a cherry on top! After thinking of colors and known animals, then made up animals and made up dessert he moves on to made up activities, like Kitty O‚ÄôSullivan Krauss‚Äôs balloon swimming pool! After Seuss presents the reader with various things to think up, he then moves on to questions the reader should ask herself. Such as, how much water can fifty elephants drink or what would you do if you met a JIBBOO? There is no explanation for what a JIBBOO is, we just get a sketchy image leaving us to wonder and think up a story for the JIBBOO. In typical Seuss fashion things get busier and more colorful at the end. He fills the page with many crazy creatures and much activity when he asks the reader why so many things go to the right. This causes the reader‚Äôs eyes to scan the page taking in every detail until she is finally willing to turn the page. The final page is a busier and more colorful version of the first page, with bird-like creatures walking along a curved path, breaking the laws of gravity just as the text breaks the rules of reading left to right.

It is a collection of 22 tongue-twisters such as \\"Oh my brothers! Oh my sisters! These are Terrible Tongue Twisters!\\" It was Dr. Seuss's last beginner book. This book was also used in the Beginner Book Video Series along with Hop on Pop and Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!. It was read by Miranda Richardson for HarperCollins along with Scrambled Eggs Super!, Horton Hatches the Egg and The Sneetches and Other Stories. Plot =Introduction= In the introduction, Hooey the parrot reads the book of \\"Oh Say Can You Say\\" and states that the words in it are all phooey, and when one says them, one's lips will make slips and backflips, and one's tongues may end up in St. Louie. =Fresh, Fresher, Freshest= In the first one, a diner owner Finney sells 3 platters of fish which are fresh, fresher, and freshest to which he considers French-fried. =Dinn's Shin= In the second one, a skeletal Apatosaurus Dinn at a museum loses his left front shinbones, but with his handy shinbone pin bin, Pinner Blinn appears and fixes Dinn up by pinning his shinbones right back in. =Bed Spreader, Bread Spreader= In the third one, while a bed spreader spreads his bedspread on his bed, a bread spreader spreads butter on slices of bread. However, if the bed spreader doesn't pay attention to how he's doing so, the bread spreader ends up buttering his entire bedding when he's covered by his bedspread. =Ape Cakes, Grape Cakes= In the fourth one, a hungry monkey sits on a palm tree wolfing down a plate of green grape cakes and states that the keener keen apes are to gobble the cakes which are great. This is followed by a short poem in which a dog-like creature, resembling Marvin K. Mooney, looks in his hand-held mirror and sees what he says and then just says what he sees. =Money= In the fifth one, a man should leave his pet called a Grox home when he travels by air. However, if he takes him with him, they doubly charge costs, and he must pack up and lock up the Grox in a Grox box which costs much, much more than any fox boxes. So, to fly with his foxes, it's a lot cheaper than spend a lot of money on boxes for Groxes. =Thimble or Shingle= In the sixth one, the dog-like creature asks one which will cost more and to choose between a thimble and a shingle. =Eat at Skipper Zipp's= In the seventh one, Skipper Zipp invites his customers to lunch at his ship called \\"Skipper Zipp's Clipper Ship Chip Chop Shop\\" where he serves delicious pork chops and crispy potato chips. =Fuddnuddlers= In the eighth one, the Fuddnuddler Brothers (consisting of Bipper, Bud, Skipper, Jipper, Jeffery, Jud, Horatio, Horace, Hendrix, Hud, Dinwoodie, Dinty, Dud, Fitzsimmon, Fredrick, Fud, Slinky, Stinky, Stuart, and Stud), piling up on each other's head, stand on top of their brother Lud. However, a dog watches as Lud sneezes, and his name will be mud when he apparently falls down. =Quack Quack= In the ninth one, a couple of colorful ducks (blue and black) quack at each other. =Schnack= In the tenth one, the dog-like creature, carrying a creature called a Schnack in his backpack, lives in a shack that's got cracks and a smokestack. =West Beast, East Beast= In the eleventh one, a boy on an uncharted island chooses between a couple of giant beasts sitting, pouting, on each side of the beach which will be the best one ever yet. Then, he picked the East which seems to be the best, much to the East's extreme shyness. =Pete Pats Pigs= In the twelfth one, Pete Briggs the pig keeper pats every single pig until after he gets done with them, he puts them away in their pigpen. =Fritz Food, Fred Food= In the thirteenth one, Fred, resembling Mr. Brown from Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?, feeds some green morsels to his dog Fritz, and Fritz feeds some orange ones to Fred. =How to Tell a Klotz From a Glotz= In the fourteenth one, a boy, peering through a spyglass, looks up at a couple of deer-like creatures known as a Glotz (with spots) and a Klotz (with dots). The dots on a Klotz are said to be exactly the same size as the spots on a Glotz. =What Would You Rather Be When You Grow Up?= In the fifteenth one, there are a trio of dog-like creatures (a police officer, a cupcake baker, and a pancake maker) as one's asked what occupation will become and to choose between the police officer in a cap, the cupcake baker in a baker hat, and the pancake maker in a pancake- like cap which is a shape of a beret. Otherwise, if not as another one shows up which is a captain soldier in a weird-looking cap, then one will probably like that of his. =More About Blinn= In the sixteenth one, as a sequel to \\"Dinn's Shin\\", Pinner Blinn goes home exhausted from work, and when he gets plenty of rest, his twin sons play violins to play their father a lullaby thereby putting him to sleep. =Gretchen von Schwinn= In the seventeenth one, a young blonde Gretchen von Schwinn of Berlin walks down the street with her 6-stringed tin mandolin with mechanical legs. =Rope Soap, Hoop Soap= In the eighteenth one, with \\"Skrope\\" rope detergent, a lady creature scrubs a stain off a rope that the dog-like creature is holding. As for \\"Skrope\\", its slogan says, \\"Skrope is so strong that no rope is too long.\\" On the next one, he holds a giant red hoop with stains just before she pours \\"Soapy Cooper's Super Souped-Up Hoop Soak Suds\\" hoop detergent into a giant vat to dissolve the stubborn stains off of it which will be squeaky clean. =Merry Christmas Mush= In the nineteenth one, at Christmas brunch, Santa Claus serves a boy and his dog a bowl full of sickening green mush, much to their disgust. =And Speaking of Christmas....= In the twentieth one, the boy sees his father Jim floating in the water, wearing a pair of swim fins which is his perfect Christmas gift. Then, a man (and one's father) named Dwight, outside at night, looks at some birds with a Bright Dwight Bird Flight Night Sight Light on his head which is his Christmas gift, also. =But Never Give Your Daddy a Walrus= In the twenty-first one, a blonde girl brings her father a walrus which is a bad and worse pet even yet. The walrus with his tough, rough, wet whiskers whispers something to his ear which really burns red hot. =Storm Starts (Final Tongue Twister from Hooey)= In the twenty-second and final one, Hooey, walking tired and depressed and losing a few feathers, declares that's almost enough of those silly tongue twisters for one simple day. And he also says that there's one more left to go just before one's done: There he is, holding beneath his umbrella, in a thunderstorm when the raindrops start pouring, and when it stops, so does the storm.

It borders the North Region to the south, Chad to the east, and Nigeria to the west. The capital is Maroua. The province is one of Cameroon's most culturally diverse. Over 50 different ethnic groups populate the area, including the Shuwa Arabs, Fulani, and Kapsiki. Most inhabitants speak the Fulani language Fulfulde, Chadian Arabic, and French. Geography =Land= Sedimentary rock such as alluvium, clay, limestone, and sandstone forms the greatest share of the Far North's geology. These deposits follow the province's rivers, such as the Logone and Mayo Tsanaga, as they empty into Lake Chad to the north. At the province's south, a band of granite separates the sedimentary area from a zone of metamorphic rock to the southwest. This latter region includes deposits of gneiss, mica, and schists. The Rhumsiki Valley, a mountainous field littered by the cores of extinct volcanoes, constitutes a small area of volcanic rock, such as trachyte and rhyolite.Neba 22. The Far North's soils are a bit more complex. Much of the province is composed of young soils rich in raw minerals. This is true of much of the land south of Lake Chad, and of the Mandara Mountains on the western border with Nigeria. Soil here is black clay (alluvial soil). The seasonal flooding of the Logone River gives rise to a north-south band of hydromorphic soils at the border with Chad. The remainder of the territory, the Diamar√© Plain and the El Be√Ød River valley, is made up of ferruginous soils. The province's dry/wet seasonal variations create relatively shallow, ferrous or lateritic soils.Gwanfogbe and Melingui 21. =Drainage= A number of rivers criss-cross the territory, many of them rising in the Mandara Mountains. The Mayo K√©bi, Mayo Louti, and their tributaries form part of the Niger River basin. The Louti rises in the Mandaras, passing and swelling the K√©bi in the North Province. The K√©bi rises south of Yagoua and flows into western Chad. The province's other rivers are part of the Chad Basin. The El Beid River flows northwest from the Kalamalou National Park and forms the northernmost stretch of the border between Cameroon and Nigeria. The Mayo Tsanaga rises south and west of the El B√©√Ød's source and moves eastward at the north of the Diamar√© Depression. The Logone rises west of the territory and flows north to form most of the border between the Far North and Chad. It eventually meets the Chari, which also rises in Chad. The Chari forms the remainder of the Chad- Cameroon border beginning at Kouss√©ri before emptying into Lake Chad. These rivers all follow a tropical regime, fluctuating between high water in the wet season (May to September) and low water in the dry season (October to April). At the height of the dry season, many of the waterways disappear completely or else diminish to a mere trickle. The Logone all but disappears during the wet season.Gwanfogbe and Melingui 26. The low elevation of the Chad basin (200‚Äì500 metres) causes flooding during the wet season; the Logone is especially prone to this, and much of its basin is marshlike conditions along its length during the wet season. Even during the dry season, some of these remain, called Ya√©r√© in Fulfulde.Gwanfogbe and Melingui 29. The El Be√Ød and Serbewel Rivers drain these marshy areas into Lake Chad. The Diamar√© Plain, part of the Chad plain, occupies the southeastern third of the province. It is not as prone to flooding due to a number of inselbergs through the area. Maga Lake in the Far North Region of Cameroon The province is also home to a number of lakes. The most prominent of these is Lake Chad. The lake was formed by a tectonic depression that has since been filled in by the area's rivers. However, over time, these rivers have deposited sediment as well, making Lake Chad nearly disappear in the past. This is a cause of concern, since when the Logone and Mayo K√©bi flood, they meet. This diverts water from the Logone to the K√©bi, and ultimately the B√©nou√©. This has caused some scientists to predict that in the future, river capture will occur, depriving Lake Chad of one of its major sources.Neba 46. Much of Lake Chad evaporates each year and must be replaced by rains from the wet season. Local people fishing in Maga Lake Other lakes include Lake Fianga, which exists only during the seasonal flooding of the Logone; during the dry season, it is at best a swamp. Maga Lake, south of the town of the same name at the eastern border, is an artificial body of 6,000 square metres. It is known for its fishing. =Relief= Most of the Far North lies at a relatively low elevation. This lower-lying portion makes up part of the Chad Plain and slopes gently from about 500 metres in the southwest to 200 metres at the Logone River. The average elevation of this basin is 280 metres.Gwanfogbe and Melingui 11. The Diamar√© Plain occupies the lower third of the Chad plain and is characterised by a number of isolated inselbergs. The Mandara Mountains at the southwestern border with Nigeria form the highest point, lying between 500 and 1000 metres, with an average of about 900 metres. Mount Tourou is the highest point, at 1,442 metres. These mountains likely arose as a result of the same tectonic activity that gave rise to the B√©nou√© Depression in the North Province. The area was once volcanically active, as a number of freestanding necks of trachyte and rhyolite of extinct volcanoes attest. The most spectacular of these lie in the valley by the tourist village of Rhumsiki.Gwanfogbe and Melingui 8‚Äì9. The part of the range that lies within the Far North is on a middle plateau at about 800‚Äì900 metres. Isolated mountains continue into the Diamar√© Plain. The mountains' northern extent is hilly, dissected by a number of rivers. =Climate= The Far North is hot and dry. Beginning at 10¬∞ N, the climate is tropical and Sahelian, and rainfall is a relatively small per year, with rains falling a bit more frequently in the Mandara region. South of 10¬∞, the region west of the Mayo K√©bi and south to the border with Chad, in the Cameroonian beak. Here, climate is tropical of the Sudan type, with higher rainfalls of per year. Temperatures average , except for the Chad Basin, where they climb to . Actual temperatures of course fluctuate with the seasons, however. At Kouss√©ri, for example, there is an difference between January () and August ().Gwanfogbe and Melingui 14. The Far North has two seasons: one dry, and one wet. These are further broken down based on average temperatures, yielding four distinct periods in the Sudan area: dry and relatively cool from November to January as the province experiences a shade of winter from climes further north, dry and hot from January to April, torrentially rainy from April to June, and cool and sporadically wet from June to November. In the Sahel zone, the wet periods are shorter, lasting only five to seven months in the south but shortening toward Lake Chad. Temperatures reach their highest levels from January to May. Beginning at about 11¬∞ N, the province only experiences about 25 to 30 rainy days each year. =Plant and animal life= Giraffes in Waza National Park during the dry season The whole territory of the Far North Province was once home to most of Africa's iconic species: antelope, jackals, cheetahs, crocodiles, elephants, giraffes, heron, hippopotami, hyenas, leopards, lions, monkeys, warthogs, and others. Centuries of human habitation have today forced these species back to a few protected areas and national parks. Foremost among these is Waza National Park (Parc National du Waza), which occupies 1700 km2. The park was created in 1968, and has since grown to be one of Cameroon's largest tourist attractions.Hudgens and Trillo 1132. Kalamalou√© National Park (Parc National de Kalamalou√©) is a smaller protected area, which protects 45 km2 in the narrow neck of land separating Nigeria and Chad at the province's northernmost reaches.Chrispin 151. This park protects those species that routinely traverse Cameroon in their yearly migrations. Mozogo Gokoro National Park houses a diverse number of monkey and reptile species within 14 km¬≤.Chrispin 151‚Äì2. The status of the province's wildlife remains uncertain, as corruption has allowed even these protected areas to be used by poachers.Hudgens and Trillo 1122. Some villages have embraced the animals, however. The town of Logone-Birni, for example, is called \\"the village of the crocodiles\\".Chrispin 58. Savanna makes up the province's primary vegetation. Most of the area is thus covered in thin grasses punctuated by thorny shrubs such as Baobab, Faidherbia, and Karita. Those areas that have higher rainfall‚Äîsouth of 10&729 N and the Mandara Mountains‚Äîhave thicker grasses and more and larger trees. Here the shrubs have thick bark to withstand the fires that sometimes ravage the area during the dry season. The frequently flooded Logone Valley and the perimeter of Lake Chad also support thicker and taller fields of grasses. Human activities such as burning of fields, chopping down trees, and overgrazing of cattle have exacerbated the problem of desertification in the Far North. In response, the Cameroonian government, with aid from various non-governmental organisations, has begun Operation Green Sahel. The project aims to reverse the effects of desertification by reintroducing trees to the region.Neba 35. Demographics Musgum dwelling unit =Settlement patterns= In larger towns and cities, such as Maroua, houses tend to follow the modern model of concrete walls and metal roof. Though house construction differs from people to people, the most common type is a small building with a small entryway under a conical roof covered in palm leaves or thatching.Chrispin 105. Builders make walls from locally available materials, so the Matakam use stone, the Fulani use clay, and the Guizigi weave walls of straw. The head of a particular household or lineage often builds several small houses within a single, walled compound called a sar√©. These compounds tend to be built with the compound of the chief at their centre, and all houses have a granary nearby, as the long dry season prevents year-round food cultivation. Concentric farms surround the settlement, these surrounded by hedges to keep livestock away. Bororo Fulani are primarily nomadic, though they do establish some semi-permanent settlements for the old or infirm. The province is Cameroon's fourth most densely populated, with 1,855,695 people and an average of 54 inhabitants per km¬≤.Law. Most of this population lives in the corridor between Maroua, which has 214,000 inhabitants,Fitzpatrick 261. and Mokolo. Another area of high density is the Mandara Mountains, a legacy of the Fulani conquest of the past, in the Diamar√© plain, and at the Logone-Chari confluence and up to Lake Chad. The remainder of the province is moderately populated, and the Logone valley and the Chari division are sparsely populated until about the level of Kouss√©ri.Neba 109. Since independence, much of the Far North's population has been migrating to large population centres, particularly Maroua and Garoua.Neba 107. =People= Locations of the various ethnic groups of the Far North Province The Fulani (Fulbe) make up a large portion of the Far North's population. The heart of the province is primarily Fulani territory, and Maroua is mostly a Fulani settlement. They also occupy smaller pieces of land south of there, one along the border with Chad, and one to the southeast.Fanso 25. The Zumaya (sedentary Fulani group who reached the department of Diamare before the arrival of Massina Fulani) had first established their kingdom (Wouro-Laamorde) at Kalaki (Wouro Zangui). With the beginning of the Fulani jihad they joined the Massina Fulani to convert the Kirdi to Islam. The Bororo Fulani, tall, thin nomads with lighter complexions than their sedentary kin, drive herds of cattle through this region, though they also move through most of the northern strip of land between Nigeria and Chad, as well. The Fulani speak Fulfulde, a Senegambian language. Adamawa-language speakers make up a smaller group, with about 169,700 members in the country in 1982. These are broken into the Mundang and the Tupuri, whose territories lie adjacent to one another on the southern border with Chad. The Kanuri, on the western border between Nigeria and Waza Park, are the sole speakers of a Nilo-Saharan language. They numbered about 56,500 individuals in 1982. Some 63,000 semi- nomadic Shuwa Arabs live in the north of the province up to Lake Chad.Gordon. More than 974,408 people in the province speak one of the various Chadic languages and thus comprise the plurality of the population. Many of these are Kirdi, (pagan in Fulfulde) peoples who refused to convert to Islam during the Fulani conquest of the 19th century. Many of these Kirdi today live in the province's mountainous western border, as this areas was more easily defensible against the Fulani invaders. The various Mandara peoples lie primarily in the Mandara Mountains along the border with Nigeria. The Mandarawa are furthest north with their base at Mora, and the Parkwa lie directly south of them. The Glavda and Gvoko lie southwest in smaller territories. Although not part of the Mandara group, the Turu people, Mabas, and Matakam live along the border with their capital at Mokolo. The Kapsiki, Hya, Bana, Zizilivikan, Jimi, and Gude occupy the remainder of the border from north to south. The Bulahai, Buwal, Gawar, Besleri, Sharwa, Tsuvan, and Mazagway lie just east of this border grouping. The southern border of the province is home to the Daba and Muturwa. The territory between Maroua, Mokolo, and Tokomb√©re is a major population centre, and over a dozen ethnic groups live in small areas there. These are the Matal, Wuzlum, Vame, Muyang, Mokolo, Dugwor, Marva, North Mofu, Mofu, Cuvok, Merey, Zulgo-Gemzek, Mada (Cameroon), and Mbuko. Housing unit in a village in Yagoua The Buduma live on islands in Lake Chad north of Kotokoland. The various Kotoko peoples live in the strip between Nigeria and Chad. This group includes the Afade, Logone, Makari, and the Kotoko proper, and the Kuseri and Maltam. The Jina and Majera live south of Kotokoland, between Waza National Park and Chad. More distantly related groups include the Kera, with a small territory on the southern border with Chad, the Massa, who occupy the tip of the province's beak, including Yagoua, and the Musaya, on the Chad border at Dom village. With the exception of the Fulani herders, most people in the Far North are subsistence farmers. Although predominantly Muslims, the province has a significant minority of a mixture of Christianity, and traditional religions. The Kirdi peoples resisted Islam in the 19th century, though today many of these have been Islamized and Christianized at least partially. However, most groups have converted more fully to Islam. The Fulani are dominant politically and religiously in the province.Fanso 29.  Nigerian refugees  As of 30 October 2013, IRIN reports: > \\"There are 8,128 Nigerian refugees in Cameroon's Far North Region, but only > 5,289 are registered by UNHCR ... Many of the Nigerians who have fled into > Cameroon prefer to stay with friends and family near the border areas. The > refugee population fleeing from Boko Haram are scattered in very > inaccessible localities in the north of Cameroon, and many who refuse to be > registered and stay in camps are still at the mercy of the [Boko Haram] > sect, and are seen as threat to local security\\". =Economy= =Agriculture= Sustenance farming serves as the primary occupation for most Far North residents.Neba 133. Crops vary from area to area. Far to the south, planters may raise root crops such as manioc, but as one moves north, cereals dominate. Maize is found in the strip between Chad and Nigeria. Groundnuts are in Maroua and northwest and in the Mandara Mountains. The seasonal flooding of the Logone River and Mayo Tsanaga supports large fields of rice. Millet and sorghum grow all over, though millet tends to grow better than sorghum in arid conditions. Cotton is common, especially in the Diamar√© Plain, though it grows poorly in the swampy Logone valley. Beans are also common.Neba 140.Fomensky, Gwanfogbe, and Tasla 15. Village farmers typically sow in concentric circles around the farm. Hedges surround the farm to keep away animals. Farming tools are typically simple hoes, sickles, knives, and machetes. Farmland is burnt during the dry season, then crops are planted at the first rains. These farms can be quite extensive, as in the Mandara Mountains area. Here, farms climb up the mountain slopes in terraces held in place by stones. Rice is the primary moneymaker for farmers in the Logone valley. This is largely due to the Rice Expansion and Modernisation Company of Yagoua (SEMRY), which operates some 129 km2 of rice fields. Elsewhere, cotton is the most lucrative cash crop. Both textiles and oil come from the cotton.. Soci√©t√© du D√©veloppement du Coton (SODECOTON) is the main government body working to improve cotton yields in the region.Neba 244. The Bororo Fulani and Shuwa Arabs both live principally as cattle raisers.Neba 63; Chrispin 56. Bororo herds roam much of the Far North and often wind up far south for sale in Yaound√© or Douala. Other ethnic groups are today becoming more involved in cattle raising. Horses and donkeys are common in the province, although these are usually employed as beasts of burden. Farmers also raise sheep and goats. Animal husbandry is less prevalent in the Far North than in the North and Adamawa Provinces, however, as the arid conditions make watering large animals difficult and large population centres make fields scarce.Neba 152. Maroua has emerged as an important centre for animal raisers, with both a cattle market and a veterinary centre. Fishing is an important way of life for the peoples who live along Lake Chad. The Kofia Islands are home to the Budumu and to fishermen from Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria, most of whom earn their living in this fashion. The Logone is also heavily fished. =Industry and infrastructure= Rhumsiki Valley, one of Cameroon's most popular tourist attractions. What little industry the north has mostly falls into the realm of handicrafts. Much of this revolves around cattle and related products, particularly in Maroua. This city is home to many tanneries, leatherworking, and embroidery and metalworking. Maroua even has a beef cannery. Maroua also has a large artisanat, which sells handicrafts such as pottery, beads. SODECOTON Cotton gins operate in Guider, Mora, Mokolo, Maroua, Yagoua, and Ka√©l√©. SODECOTON also operates cottonseed oil mills in Ka√©l√© and Maroua. Rhumsiki and other communities are home to spinners and weavers, who work primarily with cotton. Rice processing forms the final prong of the province's industry. Much of this hulling is done through SEMRY in Yagoua. Limestone mining operates at Figuil, and CIMENCAM produces cement there. Fuel transportation by bicycle from Nigeria sold in Maroua, Far North Three major roads service the Far North. National Road 1 enters the province from the south via Yaound√© and Maltam. It continues north and east through Mora and on toward Kouss√©ri and then veers northwest into Nigeria. This road is tarred as far north as Kouss√©ri. National Road 12 handles traffic between Maroua and Yagoua, and National Road 14 goes between Mora west to Nigeria via Kerawa. The stretches between Maroua and Kouss√©ri, Maroua and Mokolo, and Maroua south to Garoua are tarred. Away from these more travelled thoroughfares, roads in the Far North are unpaved and can be quite rough. This is particularly true in the Mandara Mountains, where large stones litter the roadway. Motorcycles are often one of the few options for travel to more remote destinations.Fitzpatrick 265. These vehicles also serve as the primary taxi service in town. Access to petrol is another problem, as supplies often run out during the rainy season. Merchants often hike or bicycle into Nigeria to obtain cheaper fuel there for resale in Cameroon. A major obstacle to road travel in recent years is increased road banditry.Fitzpatrick 226. Buses service the more traveled destinations, especially the road south from Maroua to Garoua. Smaller destinations are reachable by bush taxi or privately hired motorcycle drivers. Motorcycle taxis are the primary means of travelling about in the large towns. Travel on the open road has in recent years been curtailed by increases in road banditry. These outlaws often ambush buses or bush taxis and rob all passengers. Air travel is another possibility within the Far North, and airstrips operate in Koza, M√©ri, Waza, Yagoua, and Ka√©l√©. Maroua has a regional airport. Riverain transport is possible along the Logone and Chari Rivers during rainy season. Elephants in Waza National Park. The Far North is home to many of Cameroon's most popular tourist destinations. Waza National Park is the pre-eminent wildlife park in Cameroon, and it is well managed with knowledgeable guides and rentable rooms on the premises. The wildlife there is relatively easy to see, and, of Cameroon's wildlife parks, Lonely Planet names it \\"the best for viewing wildlife\\",Fitzpatrick 266. and Rough Guides calls it the \\"probably the best site for savannah game viewing in West Africa\\". Another of the Far North's draws is the picturesque scenery. Dozens of small villages dot the province, and each of these provides its own unique draws for the tourist. Oudjilla has a picturesque chief's compound, and Tourou is renowned for the fact that the women there wear hats made from calabashes, which convey details such as marital status. The Mandara Mountains are another major draw, as they offer hiking and striking views. This is most evident at Rhumsiki, where the \\"much photographed\\" Rhumsiki Peak is located. The village of Rhumsiki is today something of a tourist trap, because, as Hudgens and Trillo put it, \\"[w]herever you look, the scenery is breathtaking.\\"Hudgens and Trillo 1130. Administration and social conditions The Far North is very much divided between Muslim and non-Muslim. This manifests in the form of prejudice against non-Muslims, especially in rural areas. Moreover, the Kirdi groups remain disadvantaged socially, educationally, and economically. Human rights organisations cite Fulani lamibe (traditional rulers) as enjoying great leeway from the government, which allows them to keep private prisons and administer justice as they see fit. Government prisons are no better, especially those given over to holding suspected road bandits. Departments of Far North Cameroon The province is divided into six departments (departements): # Diamar√©, with its capital at Maroua # Logone-et-Chari, with its capital at Kouss√©ri # Mayo-Danay, with its capital at Yagoua # Mayo-Kani, with its capital at Ka√©l√© # Mayo-Sava, with its capital at Mora # Mayo-Tsanaga, with its capital at Mokolo These are in turn broken down into subdivisions. Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers (prefets) and subdivisional officers (sous-prefets) govern each respectively. Traditional leaders, usually referred to as chiefs in English, often preside over particular ethnic groups or villages; nevertheless, many of these wield very little power today, the chiefs' compounds serving as little more than tourist attractions. In contrast, traditional Fulani leaders, known as lamibe, retain much of their influence.DeLancey and DeLancey 162. In the 1990s, politics in the region was dominated by the National Union for Democracy and Progress (Union nationale pour la d√©mocratie et le progress, UNDP) with its large base of Fulani supporters. The UNDP is largely Fulani- based today, but the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party is careful to address Fulani interests.US Department of State, 2001. The Far North has few hospitals. These are located in Mokolo, Maroua, Logone-Birni, Bini, Kouss√©ri, and Waza. Furthermore, many of the inhabitants cannot afford Western medicines.Regis 137‚Äì8. Three cholera outbreaks have occurred in the Far North since 2010, in 2010, 2011, and 2014, as sanitation and access to clean drinking water became more difficult due to extended drought conditions. Each ethnic group in the province celebrates its own traditional festivals and holidays. Among the Fulani, the chief among these are Ramadan and the Feast of the Ram. Other notable festivals include the Cock Festival of the Tupuri. During the ritual, the nephew of the head of a family kills a cock and throws its head into the fire. The head is said to always land on its right side.Chrispin 125. The Dance of the Cock is another Tupuri affair. A museum of local art is in Maroua, which houses Sao, Tupuri, Musgum, and Fulani artefacts. History =Early empires= Evidence of human habitation has been found in the Chad basin and at sites near Maroua and Mokolo.Fanso 15. The Paleo-Sudanese peoples are the earliest known inhabitants of the territory. The arrival of Neo-Sudanese groups from the east and west forced the Paleo- Sudanese into the Mandara Mountains. The Shuwa Arabs, descendants of Banu Hilal deported from the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, arrived from the northeast and settled around Lake Chad in the 15th century.Fanso 32. Archaeological finds attest to the existence of the Sao culture in the Logone valley and around Lake Chad as early as the 5th century. Little is known about the Sao, except that they were copper and ironworkers and, legend says, fearsome giants. Legends of later peoples claimed that the Sao were descendants of the Hyksos who arrived in the area in several waves. Another theory makes them the original inhabitants of the Chad basin, traditionally an oasis to the north of the basin. They may have been of Nilotic origin. Even the span of their civilisation is in dispute, with various estimates putting their rise at some point between the 5th and 8th century and their fall between the 8th and 15th century. The prevailing opinion among scholars, however, dates them to no later than the 10th century. At this time, eastern invaders entered the Chad Basin and conquered them. The Sao likely disappeared through intermarriage with this and other groups. Many of the current ethnic groups in the Far North claim descent from the Sao.Fanso 18‚Äì19. The Kanem Empire, originated in the 9th century AD to the northeast of Lake Chad, and from there expanded in the region. Islam reached Kanem early, and the rulers converted in the 11th century. Kanem-Bornu strengthened as an Islamic stronghold, and the population converted as well. Embassies were traded with North African states, and trade increased. The rulers launched a series of conquests, culminating in Dunama Dabbalemi's (r. 1221‚Äì1259) expansion south as far south as the Adamawa Plateau. At this point, Kanem and its successor Bornu were active participants in trans-Saharan trade. Slaves in particular were frequently traded in exchange for horses and salt. The Kanem-Bornu Empire lasted until 1893, when the Sudanese warlord Rabih az-Zubayr overthrew it.A Country Study: Chad, \\"Kanem-Borno\\" Other groups in the territory also formed kingdoms, such as that of the Kotoko. They were eventually split, as the northern Kotoko became a vassal state of the Kanem Empire, while the southerners paid tribute but remained mostly independent with their capital at Logone-Birni. This part of the kingdom would eventually be Islamicised as well.Fanso 26. The Mandarawa settled the Mandara Mountains in the 15th century. They coalesced into state, called Mandara. Over the next hundred years, they fought wars of expansion against their neighbours, eventually capturing Dulo, which would become their capital. Civil war erupted after this conquest, and an appeal was made to the ruler of Bornu in 1614 to settle it. The resulting settlement established Bornu as an important influence over Mandara. In 1715, King Boukar received three Muslim missionaries and converted to their faith. The Mandara would largely convert to Islam over the next 200 years. Boukar also ended Bornu influence in Mandara when he defeated a Bornu expedition sometime in the late 18th or early 19th century. He launched further conquests on neighbouring groups. =Fulani jihads= Fulani herdsmen migrated into the territory from the west beginning in the 13th century. The earliest of these settled as minorities in pre-existing population centres, but by the 17th century, Fulani-only settlements had been established. A conversion to Islam only strengthened Fulani identity, and by 1804, population pressures were driving Fulani herdsmen to seek new territory in which to lead their cattle. Usman Dan Fodio declared a jihad in what is now northern Nigeria and Cameroon, and Modibo Adama led the charge into the land of Fumbina, which included areas of the Far North.Ngoh 32. Adama focused first on areas south. Then he turned his attentions toward the Mandara kingdom. Many soldiers who had fought Mandara in previous engagements in 1808 joined his ranks. Adama first attacked from the south and took Guider by 1810. He then took the Dulo, the Mandara capital, but the Mandarawa counterattacked and recaptured it. Bornu and Mandara allied against the Fulani invaders; meanwhile, several of Mandara's pagan vassal states rebelled. Bornu took advantage of Mandara's weakness and burnt Dulo. The Fulani took Bornu in 1845, and the weakened Mandarawa eventually fell to Fulani aggression in 1893. Adama took Maroua in battles from 1808 to 1813.Ngoh 36. The Fulani eventually came to rule the territory, with the exceptions of Mandara, Kotoko, and various Kirdi ethnic groups that had fled to the mountains and swamps. The region had been depopulated by war, slavery, and disease. Adama set up government over this new Adamawa Emirate in Yola (present-day Nigeria), answering only to the sultan of the Sokoto Empire. The Mandara Mountains and the swampy confluence of the Logone and Chari rivers supported the highest population density, as many peoples had fled the Neo- Sudanese and Fulani invasions by taking refuge on higher ground.Fanso 28, Neba 111. The region was part of a lamidat ruled from Maroua. =European contacts= The earliest Europeans to reach the territory were British explorers Hugh Clapperton, Dixon Denham, and Dr. Walter Oudney, who were exploring the Niger River.Fanso 94. They crossed the Sahara Desert overland and reached Lake Chad in 1822. Denham then explored the lake while Clapperton and Oudney followed the Chari River. Denham accompanied the Bornu and Mandara army in its attack on Fulani in Mosfei, north of Maroua in April 1823. He was captured, but managed to escape as his Fulani captors argued over his clothing.Fanso 95. Oudney died in 1823. Clapperton and Denham regrouped near the Mandara Mountains and returned to England in 1825. They published their adventures in 1826 as Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa, 1822, 1823, 1824. James Richardson led a British expedition to the Chad Basin in 1851. He was accompanied by Germans Heinrich Barth and Herman Overweg. Their goal was to explore the land south of Lake Chad. Richardson died at Lake Chad in 1851. The others arrived at the Mandara Mountains and then explored Uba, the northernmost Fulani settlement in the Adamawa Emirate then continued on to Yola. Overweg died in 1852, but by 1855, Barth was back in England, where he published Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa. In 1865 to 1867, two German expeditions under Gerhard Rolfs and Gustav Nachtigal explored the Chad Basin and the Mandara Mountains. They noted the potential commercial benefits of the area to Germany. In 1868, Nachtigal returned, reaching Lake Chad basin in June 1870. He stayed three years as a guest of the Sultan of Bornu, noting the groups around and their relations to one another.Fanso 97. He returned to Europe in 1875 and published a three-volume Sahara and Sudan in 1879. =Colonial administration= In 1884, Germany took nominal control over the territory. They sent an army north and met with Fulani resistance. With the fall of Tibati in 1899 under Captain Von Kamptz and Lieutenant Hans Dominik, the area was subdued.Ngoh 78. The region became part of the administrative units ruled from Garoua and Mora. Much of the local administration was left in the hands of the lamidos. The Germans placed the Wandala and the Kirdi under the jurisdiction of these Fulani rulers. In 1903, the German Resident at Maroua, Graff Fugger, was assassinated by Yerima Mustafa. The Germans invaded Maroua and set up another administrative unit there.Ngoh 78‚Äì9. The area was otherwise largely ignored, as the crops available were not as lucrative as the rubber and ivory found in the jungles to the south. The only real way to get in or out was along the Benue River, which travelled through British-controlled Nigeria. In World War I, the French under General Aymerich attacked the German outpost at Kouss√©ri. On 25 August 1914, Colonel C. H. P. Carter attacked Germans at Mora, but was repulsed after a two-day fight. Captain Von Reuben continued the resistance, but he succumbed to the Anglo-French allies eventually. In February 1916, France became the colonial head of the area. The territory was placed in the Mora-Garoua administrative unit, headed at Garoua. France allowed the lamidos to keep their power, but it also overthrew any who refused to comply with French mandates. They set up independent Kirdi chiefdoms to discourage animosity between the Islamic and non-Islamic peoples in the territory.Ngoh 134. Missionaries began to arrive, setting up a Bible school at Yagoua and a printing press for religious literature in Ka√©l√©. The French improved the roads and built an airstrip at Maroua. In 1931, they introduced a higher- yielding form of cotton. They also began SEMRY, a rice-growing project in the Logone-Chari swamplands. The first Cameroonian premier of Cameroon, Andr√©- Marie Mbida, startled the Fulani of the area when he announced his Abong-Mbang Resolutions in 1957. One of these stated that northern French Cameroon was to be \\"democratised\\", which the lamidos read to mean that their power would be curtailed. The northern territories threatened to secede and join with Chad. Northerner Ahmadou Ahidjo and his Union Camerounaise party rejected the resolutions, and Ahidjo used the issue to gain leverage and replace Mbida as prime minister.Ngoh 162. =Post-independence= Cameroon was granted independence on 1 January 1960 with Ahmadou Ahidjo its president. Under his rule, SODECOTON was set up, as was the Soci√©t√© de D√©veloppement et d'Exploitation des Production Animales (SODEPA) set up to improve ranching in 1974. Another was SEMRY in 1971. Upon Paul Biya's accession to the presidency, Moussa Yaya was accused of stirring up the lamidos against him. The UNDP is a Fulani-based party, but the CPDM is careful to support their interests. In 1983, the Grand North was split into three provinces. Border areas of the Far North have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency spilling into Cameroon from neighboring Nigeria, resulting in the December 2014 Cameroon clashes. In January 2015, many schools in the Far North did not re-open after the Christmas vacation, and it was reported that \\"Thousands of teachers, students and pupils have fled schools located along the border due to bloody confrontations between the Cameroon military and suspected Boko Haram militants.\\" Culture = Traditional Dances= File:DanseursNord.jpg File:DanseurNord1.jpg File:GroupeDanseNord2.jpgDance Group Tupuri File:DanseurNord2.jpg File:PrestationNord2.jpg File:DanseuseNord.jpg File:PrestationNord.jpg File:PrestationNord3.jpg File:DanseurNord4.jpg File:DanseurNord.jpg File:GroupeDanseNord3.jpgDance Tupuri File:GroupeTradionnelNord.jpgDance Group Types of hair covers common in the region File:Kdfchapeau8.JPG File:Kdfpublic11.JPG File:Kdfpublic20.JPG Notes References *\\"Cameroon\\". 23 February 2001.

The essential characteristics of Pahlavi are *the use of a specific Aramaic-derived script; *the high incidence of Aramaic words used as heterograms (called hozwƒÅrishn, \\"archaisms\\"). Pahlavi compositions have been found for the dialects/ethnolects of Parthia, Persis, Sogdiana, Scythia, and Khotan. Independent of the variant for which the Pahlavi system was used, the written form of that language only qualifies as Pahlavi when it has the characteristics noted above. Pahlavi is then an admixture of *written Imperial Aramaic, from which Pahlavi derives its script, logograms, and some of its vocabulary. *spoken Middle Iranian, from which Pahlavi derives its terminations, symbol rules, and most of its vocabulary. Pahlavi may thus be defined as a system of writing applied to (but not unique for) a specific language group, but with critical features alien to that language group. It has the characteristics of a distinct language, but is not one. It is an exclusively written system, but much Pahlavi literature remains essentially an oral literature committed to writing and so retains many of the characteristics of oral composition. Etymology The term Pahlavi is said. to be derived from the Parthian language word parthav or parthau, meaning Parthia, a region just east of the Caspian Sea, with the -i suffix denoting the language and people of that region. If this etymology is correct, Parthav presumably became pahlaw through a semivowel glide rt (or in other cases rd) change to l, a common occurrence in language evolution (e.g. Arsacid sard became sal, zard>zal, vard>gol, sardar>salar etc.). The term has been traced back further to Avestan p…ôr…ôthu- \\"broad [as the earth]\\", also evident in Sanskrit p≈óthvi- \\"earth\\" and parthivi \\"[lord] of the earth\\". Common to all Indo-Iranian languages is a connotation of \\"mighty\\". History The earliest attested use of Pahlavi dates to the reign of Arsaces I of Parthia (250 BC) in early Parthian coins with Pahlavi scripts., no citation, but probably referring to There are also several Pahlavi texts written during the reign of Mithridates I (r. 171‚Äì138 BC).. The cellars of the treasury at Mithradatkird (near modern-day Nisa) reveal thousands of pottery sherds with brief records; several ostraca that are fully dated bear references to members of the immediate family of the king. cf. . Such fragments, as also the rock inscriptions of Sassanid kings, which are datable to the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, do not, however, qualify as a significant literary corpus. Although in theory Pahlavi could have been used to render any Middle Iranian language and hence may have been in use as early as 300 BC, no manuscripts that can be dated to before the 6th century AD have yet been found. Thus, when used for the name of a literary genre, i.e. Pahlavi literature, the term refers to Middle Iranian (mostly Middle Persian) texts dated near or after the fall of the Sassanid empire and (with exceptions) extending to about AD 900, after which Iranian languages enter the \\"modern\\" stage. The oldest surviving example of the Pahlavi literature is from fragments of the so-called \\"Pahlavi Psalter\\", a 6th- or 7th-century-AD translation of a Syriac Psalter found at Bulay√Øq on the Silk Road, near Turpan in north-west China. It is in a more archaic script than Book Pahlavi.. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Pahlavi script was replaced by the Arabic script, except in Zoroastrian sacred literature. The replacement of the Pahlavi script with the Arabic script in order to write the Persian language was done by the Tahirids in 9th century Khurasan. In the present day, \\"Pahlavi\\" is frequently identified with the prestige dialect of south-west Iran, formerly and properly called PƒÅrsi, after Pars (Persia proper). This practice can be dated to the period immediately following the Islamic conquest. Script The Pahlavi script is one of the two essential characteristics of the Pahlavi system (see above). Its origin and development occurred independently of the various Middle Iranian languages for which it was used. The Pahlavi script is derived from the Aramaic script as it was used under the Sassanids, with modifications to support the phonology of the Iranian languages. It is essentially a typical abjad, where, in general, only long vowels are marked with matres lectionis (although short /i/ and /u/ are sometimes expressed so as well), and vowel-initial words are marked with an aleph. However, because of the high incidence of logograms derived from Aramaic words, the Pahlavi script is far from always phonetic; and even when it is phonetic, it may have more than one transliterational symbol per sign, because certain originally different Aramaic letters have merged into identical graphic forms ‚Äì especially in the Book Pahlavi variety. (For a review of the transliteration problems of Pahlavi, see Henning.) In addition to this, during much of its later history, Pahlavi orthography was characterized by historical or archaizing spellings. Most notably, it continued to reflect the pronunciation that preceded the widespread Iranian lenition processes, whereby postvocalic voiceless stops and affricates had become voiced, and voiced stops had become semivowels. Similarly, certain words continued to be spelt with postvocalic and even after the consonants had been debuccalized to in the living language. The Pahlavi script consisted of two widely used forms: Inscriptional Pahlavi and Book Pahlavi. A third form, Psalter Pahlavi, is not widely attested. =Inscriptional Parthian= Although the Parthian Arsacids generally wrote in Greek, some of the coins and seals of the Arsacid period (mid-3rd-century BC to early 3rd-century AD) also include inscriptions in the Parthian language. The script of these inscriptions is called inscriptional Parthian. Numerous clay fragments from Arsacid-era Parthia proper, in particular a large collection of fragments from Nisa that date to the reign of Mithridates I (r. 171‚Äì138 BC), are likewise inscribed in inscriptional Parthian. The bilingual and trilingual inscriptions of the early (3rd-century AD) Sassanids include Parthian texts, which were then also rendered in inscriptional Parthian. The Parthian language was a Middle Iranian language of Parthia proper, a region in the north-western segment of the Iranian plateau where the Arsacids had their power base. Inscriptional Parthian script had 22 letters for sounds and 8 letters for numerals. The letters were not joined. Inscriptional Parthian has its own Unicode block.

Shapur inscription in Naqsh-e Rajab =Inscriptional Pahlavi= Inscriptional Pahlavi is the name given to a variant of the Pahlavi script as used to render the 3rd6th-century Middle Persian language inscriptions of the Sassanid kings and other notables. Genuine Middle Persian as it appears in these inscriptions was the Middle Iranian language of Persia proper, the region in the south- western corner of the Iranian plateau where the Sassanids had their power base. Inscriptional Pahlavi script had 19 characters which were not joined.. File:Gold-M√ºnze Ardaschir I Sassaniden.jpgCoin of Ardashir I (r. 224‚Äì242) with Inscriptional Pahlavi writings.

This text, which was found at Bulayiq near Turpan in northwest China, is the earliest evidence of literary composition in Pahlavi, dating to the 6th or 7th century AD. The extant manuscript dates no earlier than the mid-6th century since the translation reflects liturgical additions to the Syriac original by Mar Aba I, who was Patriarch of the Church of the East c. 540‚Äì552. Its use is peculiar to Christians in Iran, given its use in a fragmentary manuscript of the Psalms of David.https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11147-n4040-psalter-pahlavi.pdf The script of the psalms has altogether 18 graphemes, 5 more than Book Pahlavi and one less than Inscriptional Pahlavi. As in Book Pahlavi, letters are connected to each other. The only other surviving source of Psalter Pahlavi are the inscriptions on a bronze processional cross found at Herat, in present-day Afghanistan. Due to the dearth of comparable material, some words and phrases in both sources remain undeciphered. Of the 18 characters, 9 connect in all four traditional abjad positions, while 9 connect only on their right or are isolated. Numbers are built from units of 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, and 100. The numbers 10 and 20 join on both sides, but the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 only join on the right, and if they are followed by an additional digit, they lose their tail, which is visually evident in their isolated forms. There are 12 encoded punctuation characters, and many are similar to those found in Syriac. The section marks are written in half-red and half-black, and several documents have entire sections in both black and red, as a means of distinction. =Book Pahlavi= Book Pahlavi is a smoother script in which letters are joined to each other and often form complicated ligatures. Book Pahlavi was the most common form of the script, with only 12 or 13 graphemes (13 when including aleph) representing 24 sounds. The formal coalescence of originally different letters caused ambiguity, and the letters became even less distinct when they formed part of a ligature. In its later forms, attempts were made to improve the consonantary and reduce ambiguity through diacritic marks. Book Pahlavi continued to be in common use until about AD 900. After that date, Pahlavi was preserved only by the Zoroastrian clergy. File:Eranshahr.svgThe word ƒírƒÅn- ≈°ahr, spelled  æyl æn≈°tr', in Book Pahlavi.

File:Stone cross with Pahlavi inscription.jpgStone cross with Book Pahlavi writings. Valiyapalli Church in Kottayam, Kerala, India. =Logograms= In both Inscriptional and Book Pahlavi, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, were spelled according to their Aramaic equivalents, which were used as logograms. For example, the word for \\"dog\\" was written as (Aramaic kalbƒÅ) but pronounced sag; and the word for \\"bread\\" would be written as Aramaic (la·∏•mƒÅ) but understood as the sign for Iranian nƒÅn. These words were known as huzvƒÅrishn. Such a logogram could also be followed by letters expressing parts of the Persian word phonetically, e.g. for pitar \\"father\\". The grammatical endings were usually written phonetically. A logogram did not necessarily originate from the lexical form of the word in Aramaic, it could also come from a declined or conjugated Aramaic form. For example, t≈ç \\"you\\" (singular) was spelt (Aramaic \\"to you\\", including the preposition l-). A word could be written phonetically even when a logogram for it existed (pitar could be or ), but logograms were nevertheless used very frequently in texts. Many huzvarishn were listed in the lexicon Frahang-i Pahlavig. The practice of using these logograms appears to have originated from the use of Aramaic in the chancelleries of the Achaemenid Empire.. Partly similar phenomena are found in the use of Sumerograms and Akkadograms in ancient Mesopotamia and the Hittite empire, and in the adaptation of Chinese writing to Japanese. =Problems in reading Book Pahlavi= As pointed out above, the convergence in form of many of the characters of Book Pahlavi causes a high degree of ambiguity in most Pahlavi writing and it needs to be resolved by the context. Some mergers are restricted to particular groups of words or individual spellings. Further ambiguity is added by the fact that even outside of ligatures, the boundaries between letters are not clear, and many letters look identical to combinations of other letters. As an example, one may take the fact that the name of God, Ohrmazd, could equally be read (and, by Parsis, often was read) Anhoma. Historically speaking, it was spelt , a fairly straightforward spelling for an abjad. However, had coalesced with ; had coalesced, in the spelling of certain words, with both and ; and had been reduced, in the spelling of certain words, to a form whose combination with was indistinguishable from a , which in turn had coalesced with . This meant that the same orthographic form that stood for could also be interpreted as (among many other possible readings). The logograms could also pose problems. For this reason, important religious texts were sometimes transcribed into the phonetically unambiguous Avestan alphabet. This latter system is called Pazend. Literary dialects From a formal historical and linguistic point of view, the Pahlavi script does not have a one-to-one correspondence with any Middle Iranian language: none was written in Pahlavi exclusively, and inversely, the Pahlavi script was used for more than one language. Still, the vast majority of surviving Pahlavi texts are in Middle Persian, hence the occasional use of the term \\"Pahlavi\\" to refer to that language. =Arsacid Pahlavi= Following the overthrow of the Seleucids, the Parthian Arsacids‚Äîwho considered themselves the legitimate heirs of the Achaemenids‚Äîadopted the manner, customs and government of the Persian court of two centuries previously. Among the many practices so adopted was the use of the Aramaic language (\\"Imperial Aramaic\\") that together with Aramaic script served as the language of the chancellery. By the end of the Arsacid era, the written Aramaic words had come to be understood as logograms, as explained above. The use of Pahlavi gained popularity following its adoption as the language/script of the commentaries (Zend) on the Avesta.. Propagated by the priesthood, who were not only considered to be transmitters of all knowledge but were also instrumental in government, the use of Pahlavi eventually reached all corners of the Parthian Arsacid empire. Arsacid Pahlavi is also called Parthian Pahlavi (or just Parthian), Chaldeo-Pahlavi, or Northwest Pahlavi, the latter reflecting its apparent development from a dialect that was almost identical to that of the Medes. =Sasanian Pahlavi= Following the defeat of the Parthian Arsacids by the Persian Sasanians (Sassanids), the latter inherited the empire and its institutions, and with it the use of the Aramaic-derived language and script. Like the Parthians before him, Ardeshir, the founder of the second Persian Empire, projected himself as a successor to the regnal traditions of the first, in particular those of Artaxerxes II, whose throne name the new emperor adopted. From a linguistic point of view, there was probably only little disruption. Since the Sassanids had inherited the bureaucracy, in the beginning the affairs of government went on as before, with the use of dictionaries such as the Frahang-i Pahlavig assisting the transition. The royalty themselves came from a priestly tradition (Ardeshir's father and grandfather were both, in addition to being kings, also priests), and as such would have been proficient in the language and script. More importantly, being both Western Middle Iranian languages, Parthian was closely related to the dialect of the southwest (which was more properly called PƒÅrsi, that is, the language of PƒÅrsƒÅ, Persia proper). Arsacid Pahlavi did not die out with the Arsacids. It is represented in some bilingual inscriptions alongside the Sassanid Pahlavi; by the parchment manuscripts of Auroman; and by certain Manichaean texts from Turpan. Furthermore, the archaic orthography of Sasanian Pahlavi continued to reflect, in many respects, pronunciations that had been used in Arsacid times (in Parthia as well as Fars) and not its contemporary pronunciation. Sasanian Pahlavi is also called Sassanid Pahlavi, Persian Pahlavi, or Southwest Pahlavi. It is between 1787 and 1791 that Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy deciphered the Pahlavi inscriptions of the Sassanid kings. =Post-conquest Pahlavi= Following the Islamic conquest of the Sassanids, the term Pahlavi came to refer to the (written) \\"language\\" of the southwest (i.e. PƒÅrsi). How this came to pass remains unclear, but it has been assumed that this was simply because it was the dialect that the conquerors would have been most familiar with. As the language and script of religious and semi-religious commentaries, Pahlavi remained in use long after that language had been superseded (in general use) by Modern Persian and Arabic script had been adopted as the means to render it. As late as the 17th century, Zoroastrian priests in Iran admonished their Indian co-religionists to learn it. R382 Post-conquest Pahlavi (or just Pahlavi) is also called Zoroastrian Pahlavi or Zoroastrian Middle Persian.

Walter N. Pahnke, a graduate student in theology at Harvard Divinity School, designed the experiment under the supervision of Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Pahnke's experiment investigated whether psilocybin (the active principle in psilocybin mushrooms) would act as a reliable entheogen in religiously predisposed subjects. Experiment Prior to the Good Friday service, twenty graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the Boston area were randomly divided into two groups. In a double-blind experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a control group received a large dose of niacin. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an active placebo. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug. However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. Almost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that psychedelic drugs can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar Huston Smith, who would become an author of several textbooks on comparative religion. He later described his experience as \\"the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced\\". Doblin's follow-up In a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin except for one described their experience as having elements of \\"a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life\\".\\"Attia 2019 Psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the double-blind procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast \\"a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects\\". A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated \\"[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry.\\" Griffiths' study In 2002 (published in 2006), a study was conducted at Johns Hopkins University by Roland R. Griffiths that assessed mystical experience after psilocybin. In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.

It is generally between 50 cm and 2 meters tall with several stems that fork from a substantial base. The stems and base are covered in leaves so dissected that they resemble branching green threads coming out of the stem in fractal patterns. When crushed, the leaves and flowers smell rather unpleasant.  Classification  Dogfennel is closely related to Eupatorium compositifolium (yankeeweed) and Eupatorium leptophyllum and some authors consider all of them varieties of E. capillifolium. Others maintain them as three species but consider them a related group, known as dogfennels or the Traganthes group. They all are characterized by dissected leaves.  Cultivation and uses  Dogfennel thrives on roadsides, in fields and reduced tillage crops, as well as areas that have burned or otherwise been disturbed. It is found in the early to middle (seral) stages of ecological succession. It is native to the southern and eastern United States, from Massachusetts south to Florida, and west to Missouri and Texas, and also Cuba and the Bahamas. Unlike insect-pollinated plants in this genus, E. capillifolium is wind-pollinated. Dogfennel was also known to be planted by Johnny Appleseed. Dogfennel is eaten by Florida's scarlet-bodied wasp moth, Cosmosoma myrodora. These moths feed on the plant while mature, to store its toxins and ward off predators.  Control  Dogfennel spreads by both seeds and rootstocks and can grow quite aggressively. It is common in pastures, especially those that are unimproved or overgrazed, and degrades the quality of the pasture by competing with desired forage species. Dogfennel contains liver-damaging pyrrolizidine alkaloids, so livestock are known to eat all the turf around a stand of it. To remove infestations of dogfennel, the recommended course of action is to mow it before it can seed. It has also been introduced outside its native range, for example in Nepal.Annotated Checklist of the Flowering Plants of Nepal, Eupatorium capillifolium  Toxicity  Dogfennel contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids which can cause liver failure.  Medical Uses  E. capillifolium is extracted into an essential oil and has anti-fungal properties.

A discharging arch or relieving arch is an arch built over a lintel or architrave to take off the superincumbent weight. History The earliest example is found in the Great Pyramid, over the lintels of the entrance passage to the tomb: it consisted of two stones only, resting one against the other. The same object was attained in the Lion Gate and the Treasury of Atreus, both in Mycenae, and in other examples in Greece, where the stones laid in horizontal courses, one projecting over the other, left a triangular hollow space above the lintel of the door, which was subsequently filled in by vertical sculptured stone panels. The Romans frequently employed the discharging arch, and inside the portico of the Pantheon the architraves have such arches over them. In the Golden Gateway of the palace of Diocletian at Split the discharging arches, semicircular in form, were adopted as architectural features and decorated with mouldings. The same is found in the synagogues in Palestine of the 2nd century; and later, in Byzantine architecture, these moulded archivolts above an architrave constitute one of the characteristics of the style. In the early Christian churches in Rome, where a colonnade divided off the nave and aisles, discharging arches are turned in the frieze just above the architraves.

He was educated at The Oratory School and at King's College London, representing both his school's 1st XV and the King's College Rugby Club's 1st XV. He played professional rugby for clubs such as Wasps RFC, Leicester Tigers and Biarritz Olympique, and later worked his way through the ranks to represent England in 2009. In 2013, upon retirement, Erinle returned to education, studying Engineering Physics at Loughborough University where he achieved a First Class master's degree. Career A big, strong and a powerful runner, Erinle was one of the biggest centres in the Premiership. He was a member of the England Saxons side that won the 2007 Churchill Cup, having already represented his country at that level in 2005 and 2006, as well as on the England Sevens on the rugby sevens circuit aged just 19. He gained Sevens honours again in 2008 and was a close challenger for the Premiership top try scorer three years earlier in the 2003-04 Zurich Premiership. Before joining London Wasps in 2000, Erinle played for local team Reading RFC. Erinle spent seven years at Wasps and his finishing power brought eleven tries in nineteen appearances for Wasps during the 2004‚Äì05 season, while his final total reads 26 tries in 106 games for the club. He helped Wasps win a hat-trick of Premiership titles in 2003, 2004 and 2005, playing in all three finals (2003 and 2004 as a replacement and starting in 2005). He was also a replacement when Wasps won the 2004 Heineken Cup Final. In 2007, Erinle joined the Leicester Tigers. At the end of his first season at Leicester he faced his former team Wasps in the Premiership final, and Wasps emerged triumphant denying Erinle a fourth title. However the following season Leicester got to the final again and this time defeated London Irish. Erinle started the final. In 2009 it was announced the Erinle had signed with French team Biarritz Olympique. On 4 November 2009, he was named in the 22-man England squad to face Australia in the 2009 Autumn internationals. After winning his first cap as a replacement against Australia, Erinle was named in the starting XV for the game against the All Blacks. In August 2011 he joined Nottingham in the Aviva Championship, joining up with Director of Rugby Glenn Delaney for a second spell. In August 2012 he joined US Carcassonne in the Pro D2. Personal life During his time at Leicester, Erinle and teammates George Chuter, Dan Hipkiss and Sam Vesty, performed as a band to raise money for the Matt Hampson Trust. In this band (named \\"Slo Progress\\") Erinle was the drummer. In October 2003, Erinle appeared three times as a contestant on British game show Countdown.

The Meiji government was the early government of the Empire of Japan. Politicians of the Meiji government were known as the Meiji oligarchy, who overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate. Early developments After the Meiji Restoration, the leaders of the samurai who overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate had no clear agenda or pre-developed plan on how to run Japan. They did have a number of things in common; according to Andrew Gordon, ‚ÄúIt was precisely their intermediate status and their insecure salaried position, coupled with their sense of frustrated ambition and entitlement to rule, that account for the revolutionary energy of the Meiji insurgents and their far-reaching program of reform‚Äù. most were in their mid-40s, and most were from the four tozama domains of western Japan (Ch≈çsh≈´, Satsuma, Tosa and Hizen). Although from lower-ranked samurai families, they had risen to military leadership roles in their respective domains, and came from a Confucian-based educational background which stressed loyalty and service to society. Finally, most either had first-hand experience in travel overseas, or second-hand experience through contacts with foreign advisors in Japan. As a result, they knew of the military superiority of the western nations and of the need for Japan to unify, and to strengthen itself to avoid the colonial fate of its neighbors on the Asian continent. However, immediately after the resignation of Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1867, with no official centralized government, the country was a collection of largely semi-independent daimy≈çs controlled feudal domains, held together by the military strength of the Satch≈ç Alliance, and by the prestige of the Imperial Court in Kyoto. In early March 1868, with the outcome of the Boshin War still uncertain, the new Meiji government summoned delegates from all of the domains to Kyoto to establish a provisional consultative national assembly. In April 1868, the Charter Oath was promulgated, in which Emperor Meiji set out the broad general outlines for Japan's development and modernization. Two months later, in June 1868, the Seitaisho was promulgated to establish the new administrative basis for the Meiji government. This administrative code was drafted by Fukuoka Takachika and Soejima Taneomi (both of whom had studied abroad and who had a liberal political outlook), and was a mixture of western concepts such as division of powers, and a revival of ancient structures of bureaucracy dating back to Nara period. A central governmental structure, or Daij≈çkan, was established. The Daij≈çkan had seven departments: *Legislative (divided into an Upper Assembly of appointed bureaucrats, and a Lower Assembly of domain representatives) *Executive *Shinto *Finance *Military *Foreign Affairs *Civil Affairs A separate Justice Ministry was established to create a form of separation of powers in imitation of the western countries. The government instigated Fuhanken Sanchisei, dividing territory into urban prefectures or municipalities (fu) and rural prefectures (ken). Local government in Japan consisted of area confiscated from the Tokugawa, administered from the Department of Civil Affairs, and 273 semi-independent domains. Agents from the central government were sent to each of the domains to work towards administrative uniformity and conformation to the directives of the central government. In early 1869, the national capital was transferred from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital). Abolition of the domains In March 1869, the central government led by ≈åkubo Toshimichi of Satsuma felt strong enough to effect further centralization. After merging the armies of Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ into a combined force, ≈åkubo and Kido Takayoshi convinced the daimy≈ç of Satsuma, Ch≈çsh≈´, Hizen and Tosa to surrender their domains to the emperor. Other daimy≈ç were forced to do the same, and all were reappointed as ‚Äúgovernors‚Äù to their respective domains, which were now treated as sub- divisions of the central government. In the spring of 1871, ≈åkubo, Kido, Inoue Kaoru, Yamagata Aritomo, Saig≈ç Takamori, ≈åyama Iwao, Sanj≈ç Sanetomi and Iwakura held a secret meeting during which it was decided to proceed with abolition of the han domains entirely. Later that year, all of the ex-daimy≈ç were summoned to the Emperor, and he issued a decree converting the domains to prefectures headed by a bureaucratic appointee from the central government. The daimy≈ç were generously pensioned off into retirement, and their castles became the local administrative centers for the central government. This decree resulted in 305 units of local administration, which were reduced to 72 prefectures and 3 municipalities by the end of the year through various mergers, so that by the end of 1871, Japan had become a fully centralized state. The transition was made gradually, so that there was no disruption to the lives of the common people, and no outbreaks of resistance or violence. The central government absorbed all of the debts and obligations of the domains, and many former officials in the domains found new employment with the central government. In 1871, the central government supported the creation of consultative assembles at the lowest levels of government, at the town, village and county level. The membership of the prefectural assemblies was drawn from these local assemblies. As the local assemblies only had the power of debate, and not legislation, they provided an important safety valve, without the ability to challenge the authority of the central government. Reorganization of the central government While then domains were being abolished and local administrative boundaries were being moved around, in August 1869, the central government itself underwent some restructuring to reinforce centralized authority. The idea of division of powers was abandoned. The new government was based on a national assembly (which met only once), an appointive Council of Advisors (Sangi), and eight Ministries: * Civil Affairs (Home Ministry from 1873) * Foreign Affairs * Finance * Army * Navy * Imperial Household * Justice * Public Works * Education Decision-making in the government was restricted to a closed oligarchy of perhaps 20 individuals (from Satsuma, Ch≈çsh≈´, Tosa, Hizen and from the Imperial Court). The Home Ministry, as it appointed all prefectural governors, and controlled police apparatus was the most powerful ministry in the government, and ≈åkubo left the Ministry of Finance to head the Home Ministry when it was established. Events leading to Okuma's resignation One of the pressures on the early Meiji government was the division between those members of the oligarchy who favored some form of representative government, based on overseas models, and the more conservative faction who favored centralized, authoritarian rule. A major proponent of representative government was Itagaki Taisuke, a powerful leader of Tosa forces who had resigned from his Council of State position over the Korean affair in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful rather than rebellious means to gain a voice in government. Such movements were called The Freedom and People's Rights Movement. He started a movement aimed at establishing a constitutional monarchy and a national assembly. Itagaki and others wrote the Tosa Memorial in 1874 criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government. Dissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide Aikokusha (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the Jiy≈´t≈ç (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines. In 1882 ≈åkuma Shigenobu established the Rikken Kaishint≈ç (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the Rikken Teiseit≈ç (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government political restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisiveness within and among them. The Jiy≈´t≈ç, which had opposed the Kaishint≈ç, was disbanded in 1884, and ≈åkuma resigned as Kaishint≈ç president. Establishment of a national assembly Government leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that constitutional government should someday be established. Kido Takayoshi had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals that provided for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. The oligarchy, however, while acknowledging the realities of political pressure, was determined to keep control. The Osaka Conference of 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed Council of Elders tasked with reviewing proposals for a constitution. The emperor declared that \\"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\\" as he ordered the Genr≈çin to draft a constitution. In 1880, delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the Kokkai Kisei D≈çmei (League for Establishing a National Assembly). Although the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \\"people's rights,\\" it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The Public Assembly Law (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings. Within the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, ≈åkuma continued as a lone advocate of British- style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and his dismissal from government. Rejecting the British model, Iwakura Tomomi and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the Prussian constitutional system. It≈ç Hirobumi, one of the Meiji oligarchy and a Ch≈çsh≈´ native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a Constitutional Study Mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the United States Constitution as \\"too liberal\\" and the British system as too unwieldy and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism. Strengthening of state authority On It≈ç's return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish the kazoku peerage system with new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred persons from the old court nobility, former daimy≈ç, samurai and commoners who had provided valuable service to the government were organized in five ranks: prince, marquis, count, viscount, and baron. It≈ç was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by It≈ç as prime minister. The positions of chancellor, minister of the left, and minister of the right, which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the Privy Council was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the emperor. To further strengthen the authority of the state, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of Yamagata Aritomo a Ch≈çsh≈´ native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Imperial Japanese Army and was to become the first constitutional Prime Minister. The Supreme War Council developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials. The Meiji Constitution When finally granted by the Emperor as a sign of his sharing his authority and giving rights and liberties to his subjects, the 1889 Constitution of the Empire of Japan (the Meiji Constitution) provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a House of Representatives and a House of Peers. The House of Representatives was popularly elected with a very limited franchise of male citizens who paid 15 yen in national taxes (about 1 percent of the population) being eligible candidates. The House of Peers was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. There was also the provision for the creation of a Cabinet composed of ministers of State directly responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. Functionally, the Diet was able to approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. Nevertheless, in spite of these institutional changes, sovereignty still resided in the Emperor on the basis of his divine ancestry. The new constitution specified a form of government that was still authoritarian in character, with the Emperor holding the ultimate power and only minimal concessions made to popular rights and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Meiji Constitution was to last as the fundamental law until 1947, when it was supplanted by Japan's current constitution. Elections and political power The first national election was held in 1890, and 300 members were elected to the lower house. Voting was restricted to males over twenty-five who paid income tax of minimally fifteen yen, a qualification to be lowered in 1900 and 1919 with universal male suffrage passed after much debate in 1925.Griffin, Edward G.; \\"The Universal Suffrage Issue in Japanese Politics, 1918‚Äì25\\"; The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 31, No. 2 (February 1972), pp. 275‚Äì290 Women never obtained the franchise until after World War II when a new constitution was introduced. The Jiy≈´t≈ç and Kaishint≈ç parties had been revived in anticipation of the election and together won more than half of the seats. The House of Representatives soon became the arena for disputes between the politicians and the government bureaucracy over large issues, such as the budget, the ambiguity of the constitution on the Diet's authority, and the desire of the Diet to interpret the \\"will of the Emperor\\" versus the oligarchy's position that the cabinet and administration should \\"transcend\\" all conflicting political forces. The main leverage the Diet had was in its approval or disapproval of the budget, and it successfully wielded its authority henceforth. In the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extraconstitutional body of genr≈ç (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genr≈ç made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genr≈ç, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically. Throughout the period, however, political problems were usually solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever larger role in the political process as a result. Political struggles After the bitter political rivalries between the inception of the Diet in 1890 and 1894, when the nation was unified for the war effort against China, there followed five years of unity, unusual cooperation, and coalition cabinets. From 1900 to 1912, the Diet and the cabinet cooperated even more directly, with political parties playing larger roles. Throughout the entire period, the old Meiji oligarchy retained ultimate control but steadily yielded power to the opposition parties. The two major figures of the period were Yamagata Aritomo, whose long tenure (1868‚Äì1922) as a military and civil leader, including two terms as prime minister, was characterized by his intimidation of rivals and resistance to democratic procedures, and It≈ç Hirobumi, who was a compromiser and, although overruled by the genr≈ç, wanted to establish a government party to control the House during his first term. When It≈ç returned as prime minister in 1898, he again pushed for a government party, but when Yamagata and others refused, It≈ç resigned. With no willing successor among the genr≈ç, the Kenseit≈ç (Constitutional Party) was invited to form a cabinet under the leadership of ≈åkuma and Itagaki, a major achievement in the opposition parties' competition with the genr≈ç. This success was short-lived: the Kenseit≈ç split into two parties, the Kenseit≈ç led by Itagaki and the Kensei Hont≈ç (Real Constitutional Party) led by ≈åkuma, and the cabinet ended after only four months. Yamagata then returned as prime minister with the backing of the military and the bureaucracy. Despite broad support of his views on limiting constitutional government, Yamagata formed an alliance with Kenseit≈ç. Reforms of electoral laws, an expansion of the House to 369 members, and provisions for secret ballots won Diet support for Yamagata's budgets and tax increases. He continued to use imperial ordinances, however, to keep the parties from fully participating in the bureaucracy and to strengthen the already independent position of the military. When Yamagata failed to offer more compromises to the Kenseit≈ç, the alliance ended in 1900, beginning a new phase of political development. It≈ç becomes Prime Minister It≈ç and his prot√©g√©, Saionji Kinmochi finally succeeded in forming a progovernment party‚Äîthe Rikken Seiy≈´kai (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship) ‚Äîin September 1900, and a month later It≈ç became prime minister of the first Seiy≈´kai cabinet. The Seiy≈´kai held the majority of seats in the House, but Yamagata's conservative allies had the greatest influence in the House of Peers, forcing It≈ç to seek imperial intervention. Tiring of political infighting, It≈ç resigned in 1901. Thereafter, the prime ministership alternated between Yamagata's prot√©g√©, Katsura Tar≈ç and Saionji . The alternating of political power was an indication of the two sides' ability to cooperate and share power and helped foster the continued development of party politics. End of the Meiji era In 1911, Japan ended all unequal treaties. The Meiji period ended with the death of the Emperor Meiji in 1912 and the beginning of the Taish≈ç era (1912‚Äì1926) as Crown Prince Yoshihito became the new emperor (Emperor Taish≈ç). The end of the Meiji era was marked by huge government domestic and overseas investments and military programs, nearly exhausted credit, and a lack of foreign exchange to pay debts. But, the \\"Meiji regime\\" lasted until the end of the World War II in 1945. The beginning of the Taish≈ç era was marked by a political crisis that interrupted the earlier politics of compromise. When Prime Minister Saionji attempted to cut the military budget, the army minister resigned, bringing down the Seiy≈´kai cabinet. Both Yamagata and Saionji refused to resume office, and the genr≈ç were unable to find a solution. Public outrage over the military manipulation of the cabinet and the recall of Katsura for a third term led to still more demands for an end to genr≈ç politics. Despite old guard opposition, the conservative forces formed a party of their own in 1913, the Rikken D≈çshikai (Constitutional Association of Allies), a party that won a majority in the House over the Seiy≈´kai in late 1914.

It was developed at Bell Laboratories of AT&T; in the 1980s, and was first delivered with UNIX System V Release 3 (SVR3). RFS relied on the STREAMS Transport Provider Interface feature of this operating system. It was also included in UNIX System V Release 4, but as that also included the Network File System (NFS) which was based on TCP/IP and more widely supported in the computing industry, RFS was little used. Some licensees of AT&T; UNIX System V Release 4 did not include RFS support in SVR4 distributions, and Sun Microsystems removed it from Solaris 2.4. Features The basic application architecture of RFS is the client-server model, in which a participating host may be a server as well as a client, simultaneously. It was based on different design decisions, in comparison to the Network File System (NFS). Instead of focusing on reliable operation in the presence of failures, it focused on preserving UNIX file system semantics across the network. This enabled the system to provide remote access to hardware resources located on an RFS server. Unlike NFS (before version 4), the RFS server maintains state to keep track of how many times a file has been opened, or the locks established on a file or device. RFS provides complete UNIX/POSIX file semantics for all file types, including special devices, and named pipes. It supports access controls and record and file locking of remote files in a transparent manner as if the shared files are local. This permitted binary application compatibility when involving network resources.A. P. Rifkin, M. P. Forbes, R. L. Hamilton, Michail Sabrio, S. Shah, and K. Yueh, RFS Architectural Overview, USENIX Conference Proceedings (June 1986), Atlanta, GA It allows the mounting of devices across the network. For example, /dev/cdrom can be accessed remotely, as if it were a local resource. Access to any specific file or a file system directory is transparent across the network, so that users do not need to know where a file is actually located. RFS is implemented independently of the underlying network technology. For this it relies on the System V STREAMS mechanism using the Transport Provider Interface.Dennis M.

It was released on November 19, 2002. The Revenge of Shinobi is not to be confused with the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game The Revenge of Shinobi. Although both games are related in title and follow the exploits of a ninja character, the Game Boy Advance game is no continuation or port of the Mega Drive/Genesis game of the same name. Gameplay Shinobi engages in mixed-weapon combat with an enemy in a Japan- inspired cemetery setting. The Revenge of Shinobis gameplay is that of a typical side-scroller. The player controls Shinobi, a ninja who is on a quest to stop a warlord named Ashira-o. Shinobi's main weapon is a katana, and he can also attack with shurikens. He later gains the abilities to double-jump and use dark magic and stealth moves. Most of the game's enemies are samurai and other ninja. There are five bosses throughout the game who control the other enemies. Reception The Revenge of Shinobi received mixed to negative reviews from critics. GameRankings gave it a score of 48.04%, while Metacritic gave it 51 out of 100. GameSpot writer Frank Provo focused on the monotonous, unchallenging nature of the gameplay. He also noted that although Shinobi has many abilities at his arsenal, there is not much need to use them. GameSpy's Benjamin Turner echoed these points, also criticizing the password system and artificial intelligence. Minimal praise focused on the audio and graphics.

Location The town of Kisiizi is located in Rukungiri District, in southwestern Uganda, approximately , by road, south of the district headquarters at Rukungiri. This location is approximately , by road, north of Kabale, the largest city in the sub-region. The coordinates of Kisiizi are:00 59 45S, 29 57 44E (Latitude:-0.9956; Longitude:29.9625). Overview Kisiizi owes its existence to the presence of Kisiizi Hospital. Kisiizi Hospital also has a primary school, which has close links with a secondary school named Rubirizi Secondary School. The impressive Kisiizi Falls tourism site was launched in 2017 around the beautiful waterfall and includes SkyTrail, a high-altitude high-adrenaline 3-stage zipline as well as a stunning monument, suspension bridge, small cave and lagoon and Visitors Centre . The town is split into upper and lower Kisiizi, separated by a distance of about a five (5) minutes journey by car. Both the primary school and hospital are located in lower Kisiizi, along with a small market, an internet cafe, and various residential buildings. Upper Kisiizi consists mainly of shops and housing with a number of small bars. Kisiizi Power Station Kisiizi Waterfall is the site of a hydroelectric dam project, completed in 2008. The Hospital's water engineer, Charles Swainson, is the head of the project. The current turbine produces 300 kW (0.3MW) of power. It replaced a much smaller turbine that could only produce 60 kW (0.06MW). The new power station was inaugurated at Kisiizi Hospital's Golden Jubilee weekend 14‚Äì16 November 2008 when there was a time of celebration and thanksgiving for the work and ministry of the Hospital in its first 50 years. The surplus power generated by the new station is shared with the other institutions within the hospital complex and the rest is sold to the neighboring community to generate operational funds for the station. Population As of January 2010, the exact population of Kisiizi is not known. Most of the locals speak Rukiga. Hospital Kisiizi Hospital was established in 1958 and is run by the Church of Uganda. Kisiizi Hospital provides a wide range of services and patients travel from a wide catchment area to access care. The hospital receives support from Friends of Kisiizi and has had donations towards new buildings from Ireland including St. Andrew's College, Dublin, and St. Paul's Church in Dublin. The only local church is located at the center of the hospital complex. There are a steady stream of visits by Western medical students. Friends of Kisiizi in the United Kingdom, has an annual Friends Day. Landmarks The landmarks within Kisiizi, or close to its borders include: * Kisiizi Hospital - A 285-bed, private not- for-profit community hospital administered by the Church of Uganda. * Kisiizi Falls Tourism Park with a waterfall, extraordinary monument, suspension bridge, small cave and lagoon as well as the SkyTrail zipline which runs high above the Falls in 3 stages. * Kisiizi Hospital Community Insurance Scheme, the oldest in Uganda with over 40,000 beneficiaries in 5 Districts in 206 community groups as at Feb 2018. * Kisiizi Power Station - A 300 kW hydroelectric power station owned and operated by Kisiizi Power Company Limited, a subsidiary company of Kisiizi Hospital * Kisiizi Hospital School Of Nursing - A nursing school owned and operated by Kisiizi Hospital * Kisiizi Hospital Primary School - A community primary school owned by Kisiizi Hospital * Rubirizi Secondary School - A secondary school, not owned by Kisiizi Hospital * Kisiizi Central Market - The largest source of fresh produce in Kisiizi See also * Kisiizi Hospital * Kisiizi Power Station * Rukungiri District References External links *About Kisiizi Hospital * Kisiizi Hospital Homepage *Kisiizi Falls Category:Populated places in Western Region, Uganda Category:Cities in the Great Rift Valley Category:Rukungiri District ","title":"Kisizi"},{"id":"3028760","text":"Brush Strokes Image Editor 1.01 is a bitmap graphics editor made by Paul Bird for Microsoft Windows.

It is, along with the Oregon Army National Guard, an element of the Oregon National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the Oregon Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Oregon though the office of the Oregon Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Oregon Air National Guard is headquartered at the Oregon Military Department buildings in Salem. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Oregon Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Oregon ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Oregon Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with its federal obligations, the Oregon ANG may be activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Oregon Air National Guard consists of the following major units: * 142nd Fighter Wing : Established 18 April 1941 (as: 123rd Observation Squadron); operates: F-15C/D Eagle : Stationed at: Portland Air National Guard Base, Portland : Gained by: Air Combat Command : The Wing consists of over 1,000 officers and airmen, the \\"Redhawks\\" guard the Pacific Northwest airspace and coastal waters from northern California to the Canada‚ÄìUS border with F-15 Eagles on 24-hour Air Sovereignty alert. Both operational and training missions take 142d Fighter Wing units around the globe in support of drug interdiction, Air Expeditionary Force missions, and contingency operations.142d Fighter Wing * 173rd Fighter Wing : Established 1 January 1983 (as: 8123rd Fighter-Interceptor Training Squadron); operates: F-15C/D Eagle : Stationed at: Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, Klamath Falls, Oregon : Gained by: Air Education and Training Command : Originally an interceptor pilot training squadron, today the wing is an advanced training organization responsible for all USAF F-15 pilot specialization training.173d Fighter Wing History The Oregon Air National Guard origins date to 30 July 1940 with the establishment of the 123rd Observation Squadron and is oldest unit of the Oregon Air National Guard. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The unit consisted of two officers, 108 enlisted men and two aircraft, a North American BC-1A (like the AT-6) and a Douglas O-46A. The squadron flew observation missions primarily along the Pacific Coast and occasionally made mail flights. The 123rd Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 15 September 1941 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II. On 24 May 1946 the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts, imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re- establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 The modern Oregon ANG received federal recognition on 30 August 1946 as the 142nd Fighter Group at Portland Municipal Airport, Portland. Its 123rd Fighter Squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Oregon Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act Today the 142nd Fighter Wing at Portland and the 173rd Fighter Wing at Klamath Falls both fly the F-15 Eagle with a homeland defense mission. After the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Oregon has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Oregon ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed. In April 2016, the Oregon Air National Guard celebrated its 75th Anniversary with a commemorative paint job on one of the 173rd Fighter Wing's F-15's, as seen below.

He had an elder brother Diego. √ëuflo de Chaves joined the military and went to South America as a conquistador. In 1544 in Asunci√≥n (in today's Paraguay) he participated in the revolt against the Spanish governor √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca. He helped Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala's appointment as governor, and prepared an expedition to Charcas (currently Sucre). In 1557 he planned an expedition to conquer Jarayes lands, and reached today's Brazilian federal state of Mato Grosso, where he thought that he would find gold mines. In 1561 he moved to the southern Amazon Basin with a group of settlers, where he founded the town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, giving it the name of his hometown in Spain. √ëuflo de Chaves settled in his new town with his family, being the first European to introduce goats and sheep to the region. He was killed there in a conflict with the Itatines natives in 1568. A few years later the settlement was moved to a new position 220 km further to the west because of the continuing conflicts with the natives.

A low standard of review means that the decision under review will be varied or overturned if the reviewing court considers there is any error at all in the lower court's decision. A high standard of review means that deference is accorded to the decision under review, so that it will not be disturbed just because the reviewing court might have decided the matter differently; it will be varied only if the higher court considers the decision to have obvious error. The standard of review may be set by statute or precedent (stare decisis). In the United States, \\"standard of review\\" also has a separate meaning concerning the level of deference the judiciary gives to Congress when ruling on the constitutionality of legislation. United States In the United States, the term \\"standard of review\\" has several different meanings in different contexts and thus there are several standards of review on appeal used in federal courts depending on the nature of the question being appealed and the body that made the decision. =Questions of fact= Arbitrary and capricious In administrative law, a government agency's resolution of a question of fact, when decided pursuant to an informal rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), is reviewed on the arbitrary and capricious standard. Arbitrary and capricious is a legal ruling where in an appellate court determines that a previous ruling is invalid because it was made on unreasonable grounds or without any proper consideration of circumstances. This is an extremely deferential standard. Substantial evidence A finding of fact made by a jury or an administrative agency in the context of APA adjudication or formal rulemaking will be normally upheld on appeal unless it is unsupported by \\"substantial evidence.\\" This means something \\"more than a mere scintilla\\" of evidence. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\\" Under the \\"substantial evidence\\" standard, appellate review extends to whether there is any relevant evidence in the record which reasonably supports every material fact (that is, material in the sense of establishing an essential element of a claim or defense). Appellate courts will not reverse such findings of fact unless they have no reasonable basis in the evidence submitted by the parties. In other words, they will not reverse unless no one submitted any testimony, documentation, or other evidence which directly or indirectly (i.e., through reasonable inferences) supports a material fact, thereby implying that the finder of fact must have engaged in impermissible speculation with no reasonable basis in order to reach a verdict. If the parties presented conflicting evidence, appellate courts applying a \\"substantial evidence\\" standard assume that the jury or administrative agency resolved the conflict in favor of the prevailing party, and in turn, appellate courts must defer to such implicit findings about which side's witnesses or documents were more believable, even if they suspect they might have ruled differently if hearing the evidence themselves in the first instance. This is a highly deferential standard. Clearly erroneous Under the \\"clearly erroneous\\" standard, where a trial court (as opposed to a jury or administrative agency) makes a finding of fact, such as in a bench trial, that finding will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is left with a \\"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\\" by that court. For example, if a court finds, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, that a defendant broke a window by throwing a 30-pound rock over 100 feet, the appeals court might reverse that factual finding based on uncontradicted expert testimony (also presented to the lower court) stating that such a feat is impossible for most people. In such a case, the appeals court might find that, although there was evidence to support the lower court's finding, the evidence taken as a whole‚Äîincluding the eyewitness and the expert testimony‚Äîleaves the appellate court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was committed by the Court below. =Questions of law= De novo Under de novo review, the appellate court acts as if it were considering the question for the first time, affording no deference to the decisions below. Legal decisions of a lower court on questions of law are reviewed using this standard. This is sometimes also called plenary review or the \\"legal error\\" standard. It allows the appeals court to substitute its own judgment about whether the lower court correctly applied the law. For example, as noted in Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., de novo review is required in the United States when First Amendment issues are raised on appeal.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/466/485.html A new trial in which all issues are reviewed as if for the first time is called a trial de novo. Chevron Questions of statutory interpretation decided by an administrative agency in a manner that has the force of law are subject to Chevron review. Skidmore Questions of statutory interpretation decided by an agency in a manner that does not have the force of law are subject to Skidmore review. =Mixed questions of law and fact= Court and jury decisions concerning mixed questions of law and fact are usually subjected to de novo review, unless factual issues predominate, in which event the decision will be subject to clearly erroneous review. When made by administrative agencies, decisions concerning mixed questions of law and fact are subjected to arbitrary and capricious review. Additionally, in some areas of substantive law, such as when a court is reviewing a First Amendment issue, an appellate court will use a standard of review called \\"independent review.\\" The standard is somewhere in between de novo review and clearly erroneous review. Under independent review, an appellate court will reexamine the record from the lower court as the appellate court makes its legal determinations. =Questions of judicial oversight= Abuse of discretion Where a lower court has made a discretionary ruling (such as whether to allow a party claiming a hardship to file a brief after the deadline), that decision will be reviewed for abuse of discretion. It will not be reversed unless the decision is \\"plain error\\". One consideration is whether \\"unpreserved\\" error exists‚Äîthat is, mistakes made by the lower court that were not objected to as the law requires. In such a case, the appellate court may still choose to look at the lower court's mistake even though there was no objection, if the appellate court determines that the error was evident, obvious, and clear and materially prejudiced a substantial right, meaning that it was likely that the mistake affected the outcome of the case below in a significant way. In federal court, if a party commits forfeiture of error, e.g. by failing to raise a timely objection, then on appeal, the burden of proof is on that party to show that plain error occurred. If the party did raise a timely objection that was overruled, then on appeal, the burden of proof is on the other party to show that the error was harmless error. This approach is dictated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52, which holds, \\"[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded, [while a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\\"Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, Rule 52 (as amended in 2002). The appellate court has discretion as to whether or not to correct plain error. Usually the court will not correct it unless it led to a brazen miscarriage of justice. =Questions of constitutionality= Questions of constitutionality are considered a type of question of law, and thus appellate courts always review lower court decisions that address constitutional issues de novo. However, the term \\"standard of review\\" has an additional meaning in the context of reviewing a law for its constitutionality, which concerns how much deference the judiciary should give Congress in determining whether legislation is constitutional. Concerning constitutional questions, three basic standards of review exist: rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. This form of standard of review is sometimes also called the standard or level of scrutiny. Rational basis Generally, the Supreme Court judges legislation based on whether it has a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. This is called rational basis review. For example, a statute requiring the licensing of opticians is permissible because it has the legitimate state objective of ensuring the health of consumers, and the licensing statutes are reasonably related to ensuring their health by requiring certain education for opticians. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955). Intermediate scrutiny Under the Equal Protection Clause, when the law targets a \\"quasi-suspect\\" classification, such as gender, the courts apply intermediate scrutiny, which requires the law to be substantially related to an important government interest. It is more strict than rational basis review but less strict than strict scrutiny. Other forms of intermediate scrutiny are applied in other contexts. For example, under the Free Speech Clause, content- neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on speech are subject to a form of intermediate scrutiny. Strict scrutiny If a statute impinges on a fundamental right, such as those listed in the Bill of Rights or the due process rights of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the court will apply strict scrutiny. This means the statute must be \\"narrowly tailored\\" to address a \\"compelling state interest.\\" The courts will also apply strict scrutiny if the law targets a suspect classification, such as race. Canada In Canada, a decision of a tribunal, board, commission or other government decision-maker can be reviewed on two standards depending on the circumstances. The two standards applied are \\"correctness\\" and \\"reasonableness\\". In each case, a court must undertake a \\"standard of review analysis\\" to determine the appropriate standard to apply.

Written in 1923, it was originally published in 1924, and is the only one of Mirrlees's three novels to take place in then contemporary settings, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists (1919) being a historical novel, while Lud-in-the-Mist (1926) is a fantasy. The novel's protagonist is Teresa Lane, a woman of 28, living in Plasencia, a villa in the South-East of England, shortly after World War I, who studies the spectacle of her family life with the intent of transforming it into art. The result is a play, The Key, written by Teresa after the style of the Spanish autos sacramentales and set in Seville during the reign of Pedro the Cruel, the text of which is reproduced in its entirety within chapter eleven. A list of books by the same publisher, appended at the end of the novel, includes a brief description of The Counterplot, calling it \\"a study of the literary temperament\\". Hope Mirrlees dedicated The Counterplot to Jane Harrison, with an epigram taken from Odysseus' address to Nausica√§ in The Odyssey. (Harrison was a renowned classical scholar, a former teacher and the close friend of the author. Mirrlees's previous novel, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists, also contained a significant reference to The Odyssey, in chapter 26's fanciful retelling of the story of Odysseus and Nausica√§.) As in all three of Mirrlees's novels, a drawing of the constellation Ursa Major appears printed on the last page of The Counterplot. A French translation appeared in 1929 under the title Le choc en retour, tr. Simone Martin- Chauffier, published by Plon, Paris. References *The Counterplot, London, W. Collins Sons & Co. Ltd.

This dining car plate was issued to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the Sunshine Special. The Sunshine Special was inaugurated by the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad), on December 5, 1915, to provide a premium level of passenger train service between St. Louis, Little Rock, and destinations in Texas, such as El Paso, San Antonio, Laredo and Houston. An auxiliary section of the train originated in Memphis, Tennessee and linked with the train in Little Rock, Arkansas.Official Guide of the Railways, 1936, Missouri Pacific section The train ran from St. Louis to either Longview or Marshall in East Texas. There cars for Dallas, Ft. Worth and El Paso were cut out and forwarded over M.P. subsidiary Texas and Pacific. Cars for Houston were cut out at Palestine, Texas. Until being shifted into a secondary role by the Texas Eagle diesel powered streamliner in August 1948, the Sunshine Special served as the flagship of the Missouri Pacific Railroad's passenger train service. Prior to the advent of the Texas Eagle, the San Antonio/Laredo section of the train continued over the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (N de M) as the √Åguila Azteca or Aztec Eagle to Mexico City, Mexico.Official Guide of the Railways, 1936, Missouri Pacific section Between July 7, 1946, and April 25, 1948, the Missouri Pacific and the Pennsylvania Railroad operated the Sunshine Special jointly between New York City and Texas. Low traffic west of St. Louis prompted the Missouri Pacific to withdraw from the joint operation in favor of exchanging sleeper cars. The PRR renamed its train the Texas Eagle on August 15, then finally the Penn Texas on December 12.Sanders (2008), 106. The last vestige of the Sunshine Special, an unnamed train did not disappear from Missouri Pacific timetables until 1962. The Texas Eagle achieved greater patronage volume and survived until 1971 when the MP gave up its passenger service to Amtrak. Baylor University's Immortal Ten The Sunshine Special was thrust into the national spotlight on January 22, 1927, when it struck a bus carrying members of the Baylor University basketball team in Round Rock, Texas. According to reports, the bus driver, 19-year-old Joe Potter, failed to see the train approaching the crossing at nearly sixty miles per hour from the bus' right. When Potter did see the train, he felt he had no choice but to attempt to beat it across the tracks. Attempting to put more distance between the bus and the train, Potter veered to his left, moving the bus farther ahead of the train. The results were disastrous, with ten Baylor students killed. The tragedy gave rise to Baylor's longstanding tradition of remembering \\"The Immortal Ten.\\" Notes References * * Category:International named passenger trains Category:Passenger trains of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Night trains of the United States Category:Passenger trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad Category:Railway services introduced in 1915 Category:St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Category:Baylor University Category:Railway services discontinued in 1948 ","title":"Sunshine Special"},{"id":"3028820","text":"To gamble is to participate in gambling, staking something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome.

Claims must be filed through CBP's Automated Broker Interface (ABI); claimants can not file through the ACE portal. Claimants are required to provide the data defined in the drawback CATAIR, which can be found on CBP.gov. General instructions can be found on CBP.gov in the ACE Business Rules, section 14. Privileges. CBP allows three ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù that enhance drawback claim processing: accelerated payment (an upfront estimated payment of drawback per 19 C.F.R. 190.92), waiver of the requirement to file CBP Form 7553 for prospective exports (19 C.F.R. 190.91), and waiver of the requirement to file CBP Form 7553 for past exports (19 C.F.R. 190.36). Claimants must submit an application for a privilege, which must be approved by a drawback office before a privilege can be used. Claimants may use either the generic privilege application sample found on CBP.gov , or provide the data elements defined in the specific regulation. Manufacturing Rulings for Claims Filed Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a)/(b).

CBP has preapproved several common manufacturing processes as ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù rulings (found in Appendix A of 19 C.F.R. 190) that any claimant may use provided their manufacturing process falls within the manufacturing process described therein. If a claimant‚Äôs manufacturing process does not meet the requirements of a general ruling, they must request a specific ruling from CBP Headquarters per 19 C.F.R. 190.8. Claimants may file a drawback claim utilizing provisional ruling number 99-99999-999 while waiting for a ruling approval, but in such cases, CBP will not pay drawback or accelerated payment until a claimant‚Äôs ruling request has been approved. Notice of Intent to Export or Destroy (NOI). Per 19 C.F.R. 190.35, exporters are required to notify CBP prior to the export of unused or rejected merchandise subject to drawback. Notification is made by submitting CBP Form 7553 to the CBP office of examination, which is usually the port of export. Once the requirements of the NOI have been met, the merchandise may be exported, and the executed Form 7553 is included with the drawback claim. The requirements in 19 C.F.R. 190.35 may be waived per the conditions outlined in 19 C.F.R. 190.36 or 19 C.F.R. 190.91. For merchandise that will be destroyed, an NOI must be submitted to CBP prior to destruction per the requirements in 19 C.F.R. 190.71. Notification is made by submitting CBP Form 7553 to the CBP office of examination, which is usually the port where the destruction will occur. Technical Assistance. CBP has personnel dedicated to assisting filers successfully transmit their claims. Claimants may contact an ABI rep by sending an email to clientrepoutreach@cbp.dhs.gov.

Updates on development and status of the classification are listed on WHO home page.https://www.who.int/classifications/ichi/en/ History =International Classification of Procedures in Medicine= The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was a system of classifying procedure codes published by the World Health Organization from 1978, but never received the same international acceptance as ICD-9. Due to difficulties in the consultation processes, international development of the work effectively stopped in 1989. As a result, most nations developed their own standards for coding procedures and interventions incompatible to the ICPM approach. Germany's OPS-301 is based on the Dutch extension of ICPM; the ICPM-DE. Since 2012, the WHO began developing a replacement for ICPM called the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). For those countries who didn't go on to develop their own classification of interventions, the WHO have generated a short list of procedure codes based on ICD-10-AM as an interim measure. Identifiers ICHI is using letters to identify a procedure. For example, code EAA.AD.AA is for Biopsy of Pituitary gland. Example concept Relationship to SNOMED CT (procedures hierarchy) Some procedural concepts that are present in SNOMED CT do not have a corresponding concept in ICHI (e.g., endoscopy). . SNOMED CT is using attributes that may link procedures to other related concepts. For example, SNOMED CT concept model for procedure allows linking substances to procedures using 'Direct Substance' attribute. The scope for the set of relationships in ICHI is smaller compared to SNOMED CT. Development The alpha version of WHO's ICHI was largely derived from the (ACHI),ICHI alpha version a portion of the Australian standard ICD-10-AM, which in turn was largely derived from ICD-10 and the United States extension ICD-9-CM. Currently (2014) the acceptance of the ICHI in the community of health care professionals might be better, but due to missing formal acceptance the spread of national variations beyond translation widely continues. For accounting, the Australian health administration generated a code of Diagnosis-related groups which in effect again deviates from the WHO basis. The same phenomenon applies to DRG codes in Germany and other countries. Other codes generated by the UN accredited International Standards Organisation ISO defined a deviating scope.ISO 9999:2011.

Cave Ravine is a ravine in the western part of the island. It was first mapped by Operation Highjump and later visited in 1961 by Dr M. N. Orton, medical officer at Wilkes Station. It was so named by the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia (ANCA) for a cave in the western wall of the ravine. Cave Landing is an ice foot near Cave Ravine which affords a boat landing in spring and summer. It was discovered by Dr Orton during his visit to Cave Ravine, and named by ANCA. Mast Point is the westernmost point of the island. It was named by US-ACAN for Clarence W. Mast, a member of the Wilkes Station party of 1958. Hiegel Passage is the sea passage between Ardery Island and Holl and Ford Islands to the south. It was named by the US-ACAN for Commander James A. Hiegel, leader of Mobile Construction Battalion Number One, who supervised the construction of Wilkes Station in February 1957. Antarctic Specially Protected Area Ardery Island, along with nearby Odbert Island, is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.103 because they support several breeding species of petrel and provide examples of their habitat, notably that of Antarctic petrels and southern fulmars.

The word \\"execution\\" does not necessarily mean the death penalty (although it can); it refers to the imposition of whatever judgment is being stayed. It is similar to an injunction. A stay can be granted automatically by operation of law or conventionally, when the parties in a civil or criminal case agree that no execution shall occur for a certain period.\\"Legal Definition of Stay of Execution\\", fetched from on 13 March 2009. If a party appeals a decision, any judgment issued by the original court may be stayed until the appeal is resolved. Death penalty stays In cases where the death penalty has been imposed, a stay of execution is often sought to defer the execution of the convicted person. This may occur if new evidence is discovered that will exonerate the convicted person or in attempts to have the sentence commuted to life imprisonment. In the United States, all death sentences are automatically stayed pending a direct review by an appeals court. If the death sentence is found to have been legally sound, the stay is lifted. One example of a stay of execution in the death penalty context was the James Autry case. Autry was already strapped down to the execution table in Texas on October 4, 1983 when the order came to stop the execution. He was executed a few months later, on March 14, 1984. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey granted a stay of execution on November 19, 2013 in response to a motion by the lawyers of the convicted Joseph Paul Franklin that use of the drug phenobarbital in a lethal injection would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The following day, US Supreme Court upheld an appeal court's decision to lift the stay of execution. Franklin was put to death on November 20, 2013.

With a current capacity of 19,433, it is the third largest football stadium of any football team in Denmark. It is part of the sports complex, known as Aarhus Sports Park (Danish: Aarhus Idr√¶tspark), that is run by Ceres Park & Arena. The venue was inaugurated in June 1920 as Aarhus Stadium with major renovations made in the 1990s and 2000s. In recent years, it has been known under several names due to sponsorship arrangements; Atletion (2003‚Äì2006), NRGi Park (2006‚Äì2015), and in July 2015 it was renamed Ceres Park, when the naming rights for AGF's football matches and events was acquired by Ceres Brewery, a subsidiary of Royal Unibrew. In FIFA and UEFA matches, it is known under its original name, Aarhus Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.  History and development  =Background and inauguration = Before the inauguration of Aarhus Sports Park (Danish: \\"Aarhus Idr√¶tspark\\"), the city of Aarhus had for a long time lacked modern sports facilities for mainly athletics. In 1914, the idea of a common sports ground in the city began inspired by stadium constructions in Copenhagen and the rest of the Nordic countries. This, however, proved difficult, in regards to agreeing to location as well as economy and scope of construction, which is why the project was abandoned for some time. When the director of Aarhus Oliefabrik A/S, Frederik Lausen, was elected chairman of Aarhus Gymnastikforening (AGF) in 1916, the project was resumed with new momentum. A location in the Marselisborg Forests in the area around Friheden was agreed upon, and the design was laid in the hands of engineer T. Engquist and architect Axel H√∏eg-Hansen. Now, a determined effort was made towards realising architectural and sporting plans in one master plan that also included the construction of Stadion All√©, a central street cutting through the borough of Frederiksbjerg and ending at the central piece of the sports park, Aarhus Stadium. The construction of the sports park was approved by the Aarhus City Council on 16 May 1918. The construction area was a gift from the city and during the construction of the indoor arena, today known as Ceres Arena, adjacent to the stadium, the wooden arch structure from Copenhagen's second Central Station, which had been constructed in the years 1863‚Äì64 and designed by architect Johan Daniel Herholdt, was reused in this new context. The arch had become available as a new central station was being constructed in Copenhagen. To finance the sports park, the municipality contributed DKK 280,000, while the remaining DKK 380,000 was collected from private investors. Frederik Lausen, the chairman of AGF, was responsible for a large part of this private financing. The stadium was inaugurated on 5 June 1920, the Danish Constitution Day, with the participation of King Christian X of Denmark and his spouse, Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The first international match at the stadium was marked by pouring rain, as Denmark faced Finland on 27 September 1925. = Expansion and renovations = Aarhus Idr√¶tspark. June 1920. Photo: Stadsingeni√∏rens Kontor. Since its inauguration in 1920, Aarhus Stadium has undergone several extensive renovations and expansions; all made in harmony with H√∏eg-Hansen's original red and white neoclassicist style. In 1971, a modern athletics facility was established, which was Northern Europe's first with polyurethane covering all tracks. In the following years, 1972‚Äì73, people began to politically consider the construction of a modern and more contemporary indoor arena for sporting events and music concerts. However, a long time passed between the decision-in-principle was reached in 1980 and the actual implementation of the plans. In the meantime, a new Team Danmark centre was built at the stadium in 1991. In 1997, the Copenhagen-based architectural firm BBP Arkitekterne was named the winner of the architectural competition which the municipality had announced with the objective of constructing a new indoor arena. An extensive rebuilding of the stadium was also included in the plans. Between 1993 and 2001, the construction of the arena, the completion of a new athletics facility and the stadium project itself took place. With the extensive project reaching its conclusion, Aarhus Sports Park now possessed an arena with a glass-covered entrance and a spectator capacity of 5,000, as well as a new stadium grandstand divided into two decks with its entrances to the surrounding forest, a transparent canopy and seating capacities for 16,500 spectators - a capacity which was immediately expanded to 20,032 seats. This meant that Aarhus had the largest stadium outside the Capital Region. The project was budgeted at DKK 250 million, but this budget was later found to have been exceeded by DKK 48 million. Since then, an expansion of the VIP facilities has decreased the total capacity to 19,433.  Future  A new project initiated by Aarhus Municipality named Vision Kongelunden, which included plans of constructing a new stadium in Aarhus, received a potential donation of DKK 500 million by Salling Fonden and Lind Invest in December 2019. The new stadium is expected to reach its completion in 2026. Talks of a new stadium had been ongoing for years, as Aarhus Stadium had been criticised for being outdated and due to the stands' distance to the pitch. Matches On 27 May 2006, the Denmark national football team played a friendly against Paraguay at Aarhus Stadium. This was the first national home match not played in Parken in Copenhagen since 1992. In 2007, the stadium hosted two of Denmark's Euro 2008 qualifying matches against Liechtenstein and Spain after UEFA ordered the matches played away from Copenhagen following a fan attack in the previous match against Sweden. In 2011, Aarhus Stadium hosted the final of the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. Three group stage matches were also played at the stadium. In 2018, the stadium hosted Denmark's two group stage matches of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Nations League against Wales and Republic of Ireland. Concert venue and other uses The park has hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Cliff Richard, Phil Collins, Elton John, AC/DC, Depeche Mode, The Eagles and George Michael, among others. Ceres Arena Store Hal Store Hal is Ceres Park & Arena's second indoor exhibition arena primarily used by Team √Örhus Floorball, and it seats approximately 1,500 spectators. The original name for the arena was Nye Stadionhal. During the German occupation in World War II Store Hal suffered an unfortunate fate. The Germans seized all halls in Atletion for their own use, which in 1943 resulted in an act of sabotage from the Danish resistance movement. Store Hal burned down to the ground and was not rebuild until early 1954 where the current building was finished. It was designed by architect C. F. M√∏ller in the same style as the old. In 2006 Store Hal was renamed NRGi Store Hal, when local energy company NRGi, bought the naming rights for Atletion.

Her current work focuses on STE(A)M learning and the use of augmented reality in STE(A)M learning. Personal life Brenda Kay Laurel was born on November 20, 1950 in Columbus, Ohio, United States. Laurel received a Bachelor of Arts from DePauw University. She received her Masters of Fine Arts as well as her Ph.D. from Ohio State University. Her Ph.D. dissertation was published in 1986, titled \\"Toward the Design of a Computer-Based Interactive Fantasy System\\", and would form the basis of her 1993 book \\"Computers as Theater\\". etd.ohiolink.edu semanticscholar.org She also works as a consultant, speaker and is a part- time abalone diver. In 2015 Laurel won the Trailblazer award at the IndieCade festival.  Career  Laurel's first games were for the CyberVision platform, where she worked as a designer, programmer, and manager of educational product design between 1976 until 1979. She then moved to Atari as a software specialist, later becoming manager of the Home Computer Division for Software Strategy and Marketing, where she worked between 1980 and 1983. After finishing her Ph.D., Laurel worked for Activision between 1985 and 1987. In the late 1980s and early 1990s she worked as a creative consultant on a number of LucasArts Entertainment games and Chris Crawford's Balance of the Planet. During this time Laurel also co-founded Telepresence Research, Inc., and became a research staff member at the Interval Research Corporation where she worked on research investigating the relationship between gender and technology. =Purple Moon and games for girls= As one of the earliest female game designers, Laurel became active in writing on the topic of developing videogames for girls. She posited that while the early videogame industry focused almost exclusively upon developing products aimed at young men, girls were not inherently disinterested in the medium. Rather, girls were simply interested in different kinds of gaming experiences. Her research suggested that young women tended to prefer experiences based around complex social interaction, verbal skills, and transmedia. In 1996, Laurel founded Purple Moon, a software company focused on creating games aimed at young girls between the ages of 8 and 14. Laurel's vision was to create games for girls that focused more on real life decision-making rather than creating games that focused on appearances and materiality.Moggridge, Bill, \\"Chapter 5 Play- Interviews with Bing Gordon, Brendan Boyle, Brenda Laurel, and Will Wright\\" Designing Interactions, The MIT Press 2014. The company was an experiment in turning research on girl's gaming preferences into marketable video games. The firm produced games designed around storytelling, open-ended exploration, and rehearsing realistic scenarios from one's day-to-day life, as opposed to competitive games featuring scores and timed segments. The company produced ten games primarily divided into two series: \\"Rockett\\", which focused around a young girl's daily interactions, and the more meditative \\"Secret Path\\" series. It was eventually bought by Mattel in 1999, who closed the studio.Gurak, 2001, p. 77Katie Salen, Eric Zimmerman The Game Design Reader: A Rules of Play Anthology ‚Äì 2006 0262195364 p352 \\"Secret Paths is what Brenda Laurel calls a \\"friendship adventure,\\" allowing young girls to rehearse their coping skills and try alternative social strategies. The Play Town: Another Space for Girls? Harriet was trying to explain to Sport how to Purple Moon received criticism for focusing on designing games based on gender. The research was accused of reifying the differences between genders that girls were already socialized to accept, thus the focus on the stereotypically feminine values of cooperation, narrative, and socialization as opposed to the stereotypically masculine values embodied in most games as violence and competition. =Virtual reality= In 1989, Laurel and Scott Fisher founded Telepresence Research, a company focusing in first-person media, virtual reality and remote presence research and development. Tools for Thought: The History and Future of Mind- expanding Technology VR's quintessential innovators We take a deep dive into the history of five virtual reality pioneers. Monoskop In Laurel's work regarding interface design, she is well known for her support of the theory of interactivity, the \\"degree to which users of a medium can influence the form or content of the mediated environment.\\" Virtual reality, according to Laurel, is less characterized by its imaginary or unreal elements than by its multisensory representation of objects, be they real or imaginary. While discussions around virtual reality tended to center on visual representations, audio and kinesthesia are two potent sources of sensory input that virtual reality devices attempt to tap into. Laurel's 1994 Placeholder installation at Banff Center for the Arts‚Äîa collaboration with Rachel Strickland‚Äîexplored these multisensory possibilities. Placeholder was the first VR projects to separate gaze from direction of movement, allow for two hands to participate, support two player games, and use imagery from natural landscape. The installation allowed multiple people to construct a narrative by attaching movement trackers to its subjects' bodies while letting them navigate a virtual environment by doing common physical acts with special results, such as flapping one's arms to fly. = Academia = Following the closure of Purple Moon, Laurel worked as chair and professor at the ArtCenter College of Design and later the California College of the Arts, and became an adjunct professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

They are native to East Asia but are also popular as an aquarium fish and introduced elsewhere in Asia and to Europe, North America and Australia. The alternate name weather loach is shared with several other Cobitidae, including the other members of the genus Misgurnus and the spotted weather loach (Cobitis taenia, commonly known as spined loach). This term comes from their ability to detect changes in barometric pressure and react with frantic swimming or standing on end. This is because before a storm the barometric pressure changes, and this is known to make these fish more active. The pond loach also comes in a variety of colors, such as pink, orange, albino and gray. The largest dojo loach raised in an aquarium recorded was recently discovered in a Nova Scotian home measuring at 8.46 Inches long. Description Like many other loaches, pond loaches are slender and eel- like. They can vary in colour from yellow to olive green, to a common light brown or grey with lighter undersides. The mouth of the loach is surrounded by three sets of barbels. It uses them to sift through silt or pebbles to find food. It also uses them to dig under gravel and sand to conceal itself out of nervousness or defence unlike the other loaches who use the spines beneath the eyes. Unlike most other fishes, the Pond loach has the ability to burrow into and hide in soft substrates, breathe in atmospheric air if deemed necessary, as well as survive for long periods of time outside of water.Belcik, J. (2017). Population Genetics and Distribution of the Oriental Weatherfish, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, in Chicago Area Waterways. Retrieved April 4, 2019, from https://ecommons.luc.edu/luc_theses/3556/ They can grow up to 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. The fish are bottom-dwelling scavengers, feeding mainly on organic material such as algae. Pond loaches are omnivorous and may also feed on tubifex worms and other small aquatic organisms. By producing a layer of mucus to keep themselves damp they can survive short periods of desiccation. They are very hardy fish that can live in poor quality water. In the aquarium Orange Misgurnus anguillicaudatus Side view of a pink loach Weather Loach (M. anguillicaudatus) Macro Pond loaches are active, peaceful, and hardy fish that are sometimes used as starter fish in an aquarium. They can be \\"friendly\\" towards humans, allowing physical contact and hand feeding. They are extremely peaceful. They get along well with goldfish. The loaches will be more active given more space and greater numbers. Solitary pond loaches tend to spend much of their time hiding. They will spend a lot of time hiding or staying still, but should be given a place to stay which will have cover and shade. Tank decorations that they can swim through and driftwood both work great for this. Due to their jumping ability the average cover should be secured with tape or other barriers. Also, they may even travel up tubes and take up residence in filters, so check there if your pond loach does not show up for roll call one day. Pond loaches enjoy digging and burrowing themselves in the substrate of their tank, so make sure that your substrate is fine enough for them to dig in. If you keep live plants in your tank, they will be uprooted by the loaches, so it is a good idea to weight your plants. The pond loach is also peculiar in that it will sometimes bury itself in the substrate during times of stress. This often surprises new owners, as the fish will \\"disappear\\" shortly after introduction to the tank only to \\"reappear\\" later. Because of their appetite for snails, these loaches can help alleviate snail infestations in tropical fish tanks, though many have reported that while pond loaches do eat snails, they do not eat them at a fast enough rate to deal with an infestation. The fish prefer a pH of 6.5-8.0 but will tolerate far more acidic conditions even for extended amounts of time with little negative reaction. This makes the pond loach a great choice for first-time aquariums and for those who want a hardy fish tank able to withstand a few mistakes. This fish should be kept in groups of at least 3, as they like to be in physical contact with each other and feel each other with their barbels when they rest. One trait which distinguishes the pond loach from most other tropical fish commonly seen at aquarium speciality shops and pet stores is the fact that they thrive at room temperature (68-72¬∞F, 20-23¬∞C) and can do well even at temperatures as low as the upper 50's Fahrenheit (13-15¬∞ Celsius). The usual tropical temperature will result in a significantly reduced lifespan (from an average 10 years to four or less). Purchasers often presume when buying tropical freshwater fish that all species will thrive in the (typical for home freshwater aquarium installations) 76-82 ¬∞F / 24-28 ¬∞C range; this presumption is incorrect in the case of the pond loach. There are other varieties bred from captivity like the gold strain and the peppered strain (not to be confused with the pepper loach). Sometimes the pond loach (especially the golden variety) is mistaken for the kuhli loach. The kuhli, however, likes warm tropical temperatures, will tolerate more acidic conditions, and matures at a much smaller four inches (10 cm). Although these two species have numerous differentiating traits, individual kuhli and pond loaches may resemble each other while young and at the usual age and size of what most fish stores market. As food The pond loach is a common culinary fish in East Asia, raised on a large scale in fish farming. In Korea, chueo-tang (loach soup) is made with pond loach.

The fort lay at the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall (in Wallsend) near the banks of the River Tyne, forming the easternmost portion of the wall. It was in use as a garrison for approximately 300 years, from around 122 AD, almost up to 400AD. Today, Segedunum is the most thoroughly excavated fort along Hadrian's Wall, and is operated as Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths and Museum. Etymology Five places named Segedunum are known to have existed in the Roman empire, one each in Britain and Germany and three in Gaul. The name Segedunum is known from the Notitia Dignitatum of the 4th century,\\"Segedunum: History\\" , Hadrian's Wall website but there is no consensus on its meaning. The various conjectures include \\"derived from the Celtic for 'powerful' or 'victorious'\\",Chamberlin, R., \\"Hadrian‚Äôs Wallsend\\", History Today, Volume: 50 Issue: 8, August 2000 \\"derived from the [Celtic] words sego ('strength') and dunum ('fortified place')\\",\\"Segedunum\\" , roman-britain.org \\"Romano-British Segedunum 'Strong-fort'\\",Koch, J.T., Celtic Culture, 2006, and \\"Celtic sechdun or 'dry hill'\\".Wainwright M., \\"Togas and hot tubs on the Roman way\\", The Guardian, 13 June 2000 The first element of the name is attested widely in Gaul, Spain, Germany and Italy, and derives from the Indo-European root segh-, which is reflected in various later European languages with similar meanings: Irish seg-, segh- 'strength, vigour', Welsh hy 'daring, bold', German Sieg 'victory', and so on. As applied to place names, it appears to have had the meaning of \\"place of strength\\" or \\"place of victory\\". The second element, -dunum, is a Celtic term widely attested across Britain and Gaul and typically meant a fort. Thus Segedunum probably had the meaning of \\"strong fort\\" or \\"victory fort\\".The Place-Names of Roman Britain, pp. 452-3. A.L.F. Rivet & Colin Smith (1979). Princeton University Press. History The Roman wall originally terminated at Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne). Work began at Pons Aelius in 122AD and proceeded towards the west. Subsequently, in about 127AD, the wall was extended further east, possibly to protect the river crossing at Pons Aelius. A section of the wall east from the fort of Pons Aelius, passing through present-day Byker and ending at the new fort of Segedunum was built. The new section of wall was narrower than the sections previously built, being on a foundation of . Unlike the rest of the wall, the extension had no vallum.Frank Graham, Roman Wall, Comprehensive History and Guide (1979), Frank Graham, The fort measured from north to south and from east to west, covering an area of . A wide ditch and an earth embankment surrounded the fort on all sides. It had four double gates with the east, west and north gates opening outside the wall and only the south gate opening within the wall. The wall joined to the west wall of the fort just south of the west gate. From the southeast angle of the fort, a wide wall ran down to the riverbank and extended at least as far as the low water level. There is evidence that there was an extensive vicus, or village surrounding the fort, including the area to the north of the wall. Garrison Fragments of armour found at Segedunum The original garrison of Segedunum is unknown, but in the 2nd century Cohors II Nerviorum was stationed there. In the 3rd and 4th centuries the part-mounted Fourth Cohort of the Lingones occupied the fort, as recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum. Both units were 600 strong, consisting of 120 cavalry and 480 infantry. Subsequent history Sometime round about 400AD the fort was abandoned. For centuries the area remained as open farmland, but in the 18th century, collieries were sunk near the fort and the area gradually became a populous pit village. Eventually, in 1884, the whole fort disappeared under terraced housing.* J. Collingwood Bruce, Handbook to the Roman Wall (1863), Harold Hill & Son, In 1929 some excavations were carried out which recorded the outline of the fort. The local authority marked out this outline in white paving stones. In the 1970s the terraced houses covering the site were demolished. A section of Hadrian's Wall was excavated and a reconstruction built in the early 1990s. The Segedunum project began in January 1997 with a series of excavations in and around the Fort, as well as the construction of the bath house and the conversion of former Swan Hunter shipyard buildings to house the new museum. Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths & Museum opened to the public in June 2000.Segedunum official site (2007) Today The viewing platform at the Segedunum Visitor Centre The site of the fort now contains the excavated remains of the buildings' foundation of the original fort, as well as a reconstructed Roman military bathhouse based on excavated examples at Vindolanda and Chesters forts. A museum contains items of interest that were found when the site was excavated, and a large observation tower overlooks the site. A portion of the original wall is visible across the street from the museum, and a reconstruction of what the whole wall might have looked like. The central section of Hadrian's Wall was erected atop the Whin Sill, a geological formation that offers a natural topographic defence against invaders or immigrants from the north. However at the eastern end of the wall, the main topographic defence was the River Tyne itself, and the very final stretch of the wall ran down from Segedunum fort to the river's edge. There may have been a statue or monument to mark the very end of the wall, but if there ever was, it no longer exists.C.Michael Hogan (2007) \\"Hadrian's Wall\\", ed. A. Burnham, The Megalithic Portal North Tyneside Council provided accommodation in the newly built Battle Hill Estate for the owners of all the houses demolished when the site was cleared. The name Wallsend comes from Segedunum being at the easternmost end of Hadrian's Wall; the westernmost end is at Bowness-on-Solway.

The graphics at JAMMA 2005 were described as sharp, but they won't blow anyone away yet. The character models sport a high number of polygons and animate quite nicely. The special effects used for the various attacks are sharp and go crazy with particles and lighting. The stages shown were low-key open areas that weren't big on detail at that moment. The relatively unimpressive graphics were attributed to the fact that the game started development for the Sega Chihiro Arcade hardware. The original release was planned for spring 2006, but the arcade units were called back on March 6 (the units were still in shipping and had yet to reach arcades).

History In 1882, Thomas Hines Coleman, a young deaf man, was preparing to graduate from Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., the only college for the deaf in the world at that time. He had graduated from the South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind and knew he wanted to make education for children his life's work. Florida was one of the few states that had not made provision for the education of children who were deaf/hard of hearing or who had visual impairments. Coleman wrote Governor William D. Bloxham and he replied favorably toward the establishment of such a school. As their correspondence continued, the sum of $20,000 was reached as a minimum appropriation to start the school.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 49 (PDF ) In 1883, Florida's legislature established an institution for the blind and deaf children for two years at $20,000. They requested bids from towns in the state for the location for the school. St. Augustine offered the best bid with $1,000 cash and of land, the land donated by Captain Edward E. Vaill, a pioneer of the city. Contractor William A. MacDuff erected the original first three wooden buildings at $12,749; they were completed in December 1884. The school opened in December, 1885 as The School for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb. Although the school had both black and white children in its early years, social opposition to racial integration was rampant, and the Florida Institute for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb, Colored Department was created in 1895. By 1892, there were 62 students enrolled and the first graduation ceremony, for two white deaf students, Artemas W. Pope and Cora Carlton, was held in 1898. The first graduation for a white blind student, DeWitt Lightsey, was held in 1898 and the first graduation for a black blind student, Louise Jones, was in 1914. The first graduation for a black deaf student, Cary White, was in 1925. The school was racially integrated in 1967 with the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind. The school was under the direction of a five-member board of trustees until 1905. The Florida legislature established the present seven-member Board of Trustees in 1963. Construction began on new dormitories in late 1958 and they opened in 1959. Taylor Hardwick was the architect of record. Today The school is now the largest school of its type in the United States with 47 buildings on of land. The school now has an annual budget of over $30 million, up from its original of $20,000. It currently serves 600 students on campus and 400 infants/toddlers and their parents through the statewide Parent Infant Program. The school is Florida's primary public school for children who are deaf or blind. Students are transported to the school and back home from all over the state, residing in dormitories during the week. The school serves deaf and blind students in pre-school through 12th grade, and also has a post- secondary program. The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Conference of Educational Administrators Serving the Deaf, and the National Accreditation Council for Agencies Serving the Blind and Visually Handicapped. The school has two departments: The Deaf Department serves children who are deaf or hard of hearing, and the Blind Department serves children who are blind or visually impaired. In addition, outreach programs provide support to parents, teachers, and other staff in small and rural school districts in the state of Florida. The school has a health care center for students as well as two well-appointed auditoriums on campus. Blind high school students can take a sound engineering elective and have opportunities to work with state-of-the-art sound systems within the school. The school offers ASL courses to the community for a nominal fee. Athletics and activities The school is a member of the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA). Students have the opportunity to compete in 11 team sports with public and private schools across the state and nation. School coaching personnel work with about 300 student-athletes each year. Athletic teams include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, flag football, goalball, soccer, swimming, track & field, volleyball, and wrestling. The school has three gyms, a swimming pool, and two bowling alleys. The school boasts the Copeland Recreation and Fitness Center, specially designed and constructed for the blind. The Copeland Center is the site of the annual USABA (United States Association of Blind Athletes) Youth National Goalball Tournament. Students at the school can join performing groups. The school's Deaf Department has a traveling Dance Troupe, and the Blind Department has a band known as OuttaSight. Other clubs and activities include the Blind Skier Club, Academic Bowl Team (a competitive club), and MathCounts (a traveling Math team).

It spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). Rocks from this epoch are collectively known as the Lower Triassic series, which is a unit in chronostratigraphy. The Early Triassic is the oldest epoch of the Mesozoic Era. It is preceded by the Lopingian epoch (late Permian, Paleozoic Era) and followed by the Middle Triassic epoch. The Early Triassic is divided into the Induan and Olenekian ages. The Induan is subdivided into the Griesbachian and Dienerian subages and the Olenekian is subdivided into the Smithian and Spathian subages. The Lower Triassic series is coeval with the Scythian stage, which is today not included in the official timescales but can be found in older literature. In Europe, most of the Lower Triassic is composed of Buntsandstein, a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds. Sandstone from the Early Triassic Epoch Early Triassic life =Fauna and Flora= The Permian-Triassic extinction event spawned the Triassic period. The massive extinctions that ended the Permian period and Paleozoic era caused extreme hardships for the surviving species. The Early Triassic epoch saw the recovery of life after the biggest mass extinction event of the past, which took millions of years due to the severity of the event and the harsh Early Triassic climate. Many types of corals, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and other invertebrates had disappeared. The Permian vegetation dominated by Glossopteris in the southern hemisphere ceased to exist. Other groups, such as Actinopterygii, appear to have been less affected by this extinction event and body size was not a selective factor during the extinction event. Different patterns of recovery are evident on land and in the sea. Early Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were relatively homogeneous due to the effects of the extinction. The ecological recovery on land took 30 million years. The climate during the Early Triassic epoch (especially in the interior of the supercontinent Pangaea) was generally arid, rainless and dry and deserts were widespread; however the poles possessed a temperate climate. The pole-to- equator temperature gradient was temporally flat during the Early Triassic and may have allowed tropical species to extend their distribution poleward. This is evidenced by the global distribution of ammonoids. The mostly hot climate of the Early Triassic may have been caused by late volcanic eruptions of the Siberian Traps, which had probably triggered the Permian-Triassic extinction event and accelerated the rate of global warming into the Triassic. Studies suggest that Early Triassic climate was volatile, with relatively rapid and large temperature changes. The Putorana plateau is composed of basalt rocks of the Siberian Traps. Terrestrial Biota The most common land vertebrate was the small herbivorous synapsid Lystrosaurus. Interpreted as a disaster taxon, Lystrosaurus had a wide range across Pangea. In the southern part of the supercontinent, it co-occurred with the non-mammalian cynodonts Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon, early relatives of mammals. First archosauriforms appeared, such as Erythrosuchus (Olenekian-Ladinian). This group includes the ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs (including birds). Fossilized foot prints of dinosauromorphs are known from the Olenekian. The flora was gymnosperm dominated at the onset of the Triassic, but changed rapidly and became lycopod dominated (e.g. Pleuromeia) during the Griesbachian-Dienerian ecological crisis. This change coincided with the extinction of the Permian Glossopteris flora. In the Spathian subage, the flora changed back to gymnosperm and pteridophyte dominated. These shifts reflect global changes in precipitation and temperature. Skull of Erythrosuchus Aquatic Biota Early Triassic brittle stars (echinoderms) In the oceans, the most common Early Triassic hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves, gastropods, ammonites, echinoids, and a few articulate brachiopods. First oysters appeared in the Early Triassic. They grew on the shells of living ammonoids. Microbial reefs were common, possibly due to lack of competition with metazoan reef builders as a result of the extinction. However, transient metazoan reefs reoccurred during the Olenekian wherever permitted by environmental conditions. Ammonoids show blooms followed by extinctions during the Early Triassic. Aquatic vertebrates diversified after the extinction. Fishes: Typical Triassic ray- finned fishes, such as Australosomus, Birgeria, Bobasatrania, Boreosomus, Pteronisculus, Parasemionotidae and Saurichthys appeared close to the Permian- Triassic boundary, whereas neopterygians diversified later during the Triassic. Many species of fish had a global distribution during the Early Triassic. Coelacanths show a peak in their diversity and new modes of life (Rebellatrix). Chondrichthyes are represented by Hybodontiformes like Palaeobates, Omanoselache, Lissodus, some Neoselachii, as well as last survivors of Eugeneodontida (Caseodus, Fadenia). Amphibians: Relatively large, marine temnospondyl amphibians, such as Aphaneramma or Wantzosaurus, were geographically widespread during the Induan and Olenekian ages. The fossils of these crocodile-shaped amphibians were found in Greenland, Spitsbergen, Pakistan and Madagascar. Hupehsuchus fossil in the Paleozoological Museum of China Reptiles: In the oceans, first marine reptiles appeared during the Early Triassic. Their descendants ruled the oceans during the Mesozoic. Hupehsuchia, Ichthyopterygia and sauropterygians are among the first marine reptiles to enter the scene in the Olenekian (e.g. Cartorhynchus, Chaohusaurus, Utatsusaurus, Hupehsuchus, Grippia, Omphalosaurus, Corosaurus). Other marine reptiles such as Tanystropheus, Helveticosaurus, Atopodentatus, placodonts or the thalattosaurs followed later in the Middle Triassic. The Anisian aged ichthyosaur Thalattoarchon was one of the first marine macropredators capable of eating prey that was similar in size to itself, an ecological role that can be compared to that of modern orcas. =Smithian-Spathian boundary extinction= Early Triassic and Anisian marine predators: 1\\\\.

Placodus An important extinction event occurred during the Olenekian age of the Early Triassic, near the Smithian and Spathian subage boundary. The main victims of this Smithian-Spathian boundary extinction event were ammonoids and conodonts, as well as a few Palaeozoic species that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Marine reptiles, such as ichthyopterygians and sauropterygians, diversified after the extinction. The flora was also affected significantly. It changed from lycopod dominated (e.g. Pleuromeia) during the Dienerian and Smithian subages to gymnosperm and pteridophyte dominated in the Spathian. These vegetation changes are due to global changes in temperature and precipitation. Conifers (gymnosperms) were the dominant plants during most of the Mesozoic. Until recently the existence of this extinction event about 249.4 Ma ago was not recognised. The Smithian-Spathian boundary extinction was linked to late eruptions of the Siberian Traps, which resulted in climate change. Oxygen isotope studies on conodonts have revealed that temperatures rose in the first 2 million years of the Triassic, ultimately reaching sea surface temperatures of up to in the tropics during the Smithian. The extinction itself occurred during a subsequent drop in global temperatures in the latest Smithian; however, temperature alone cannot account for the Smithian-Spathian boundary extinction, because several factors were at play. In the ocean, many large and mobile species moved away from the tropics, but large fish remained, and amongst the immobile species such as molluscs, only the ones that could cope with the heat survived; half the bivalves disappeared. On land, the tropics were nearly devoid of life. Many big, active animals only returned to the tropics, and plants recolonised on land when temperatures returned to normal. There is evidence that life had recovered rapidly, at least locally. This is indicated by sites that show exceptionally high biodiversity (e.g. the earliest Spathian Paris Biota), which suggest that food webs were complex and comprised several trophic levels.

Common emblems to be removed include the manufacturer's logo as well as the emblems designating the model of the vehicle. Often debadging is done to complement the smoothed-out bodywork of a modified car, or to disguise a lower-specification model. Some people driving high-end luxury cars, do it not to flaunt the fact their car is any different from any other model and remove the badge. In Europe in particular, it is a common request for purchasers of high-end models of cars like BMW or Mercedes- Benz, etc. to have the emblems removed. Many automotive enthusiasts also believe that debadging a vehicle makes it easier to clean. This is because manufacturer badges are notorious for trapping wax, which is difficult to remove from small crevices. Also, sleepers sometimes are debadged to disguise any subtle evidence of a high performance vehicle. Another common reason for debadging is to rid the car of its commercial advertising. Drivers are not being paid to advertise the brand so some decide to remove this commercial aspect of the vehicle. Similarly, film, television and advertising companies may elect to have vehicles debadged in a work to avoid implying product placement or endorsement of a particular vehicle marque. While most modern vehicle emblems are attached with adhesive and can be easily removed, some emblems require varying degrees of bodywork to fill in voids and mounting holes left behind. Debadging can also refer to the process of removing the car manufacturer's logo from the front grille. The grill is often replaced by a plain grille, or a grille from another make and model of car altogether or one showing the more subtle logo of an aftermarket manufacturer such as ABT, Irmscher or Kamei. This is a common customising technique on leadsleds and kustoms, which dates back to the 1940s.

It can result in multiple symptoms. Symptoms include tremor, poor coordination, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, personality changes, and nystagmus. Complications may include seizures or cardiac arrest such as from torsade de pointes. Those with low magnesium often have low potassium. Causes include low dietary intake, alcoholism, diarrhea, increased urinary loss, poor absorption from the intestines, and diabetes mellitus. A number of medications may also cause low magnesium, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and furosemide. The diagnosis is typically based on finding low blood magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia). Normal magnesium levels are between 0.6-1.1 mmol/L (1.46‚Äì2.68 mg/dL) with levels less than 0.6 mmol/L (1.46 mg/dL) defining hypomagnesemia. Specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes may be seen. Treatment is with magnesium either by mouth or intravenously. For those with severe symptoms, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be used. Associated low potassium or low calcium should also be treated. The condition is relatively common among people in hospitals. Signs and symptoms Deficiency of magnesium can cause tiredness, generalized weakness, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, increased irritability of the nervous system with tremors, paresthesias, palpitations, low potassium levels in the blood, hypoparathyroidism which might result in low calcium levels in the blood, chondrocalcinosis, spasticity and tetany, migraines, epileptic seizures, basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma, intellectual disability or death. Magnesium plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism and its deficiency may worsen insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes diabetes, or may be a consequence of insulin resistance. People being treated on an intensive care unit (ICU) who have a low magnesium level may have a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, and death. Causes Magnesium deficiency may result from gastrointestinal or kidney causes. Gastrointestinal causes include inadequate dietary intake of magnesium, reduced gastrointestinal absorption or increased gastrointestinal loss due to rapid gastrointestinal transits. Kidney causes involve increased excretion of magnesium. Poor dietary intake of magnesium has become an increasingly important factor - many people consume diets high in refined foods such as white bread and polished rice which have been stripped of magnesium-rich plant fiber. Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in hospitalized patients. Up to 12% of all people admitted to hospital, and as high as 60‚Äì65% of people in an intensive care unit, have hypomagnesemia. About 57% of the US population does not meet the US RDA for dietary intake of magnesium. The kidneys are very efficient at maintaining body levels; however, if the diet is deficient, or certain medications such as proton-pump inhibitors are used, or in chronic alcoholism, levels may drop. Low levels of magnesium in blood may be due to not enough magnesium in the diet, the intestines not absorbing enough magnesium, or the kidneys excreting too much magnesium. Deficiencies may be due to the following conditions: =Medications= * Loop and thiazide diuretic use (the most common cause of hypomagnesemia) * Antibiotics (i.e. aminoglycoside, amphotericin, pentamidine, gentamicin, tobramycin, viomycin) block resorption in the loop of Henle. 30% of patients using these antibiotics have hypomagnesemia. * Long term use of proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazolehttps://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm245275.htm * Other drugs ** Digitalis, displaces magnesium into the cell. Digitalis causes an increased intracellular concentration of sodium, which in turn increases intracellular calcium by passively increasing the action of the sodium-calcium exchanger in the sarcolemma. The increased intracellular calcium gives a positive inotropic effect. ** Adrenergics, displace magnesium into the cell ** Cisplatin, stimulates kidney excretion ** Ciclosporin, stimulates kidney excretion ** Mycophenolate mofetil = Genetics = * Gitelman-like diseases, which include the syndromes caused by genetic mutations in SLC12A3, CLNCKB, BSND, KCNJ10, FXYD2, HNF1B or PCBD1. In these diseases, the hypomagnesemia is accompanied by other defects in electrolyte handling such as hypocalciuria and hypokalemia. The genes involved in this group of diseases all encode proteins that are involved in reabsorbing electrolytes (including magnesium) in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. * Hypercalciuric hypomagnesemic syndromes, which encompass the syndromes caused by mutations in CLDN16, CLDN19, CASR or CLCNKB. In these diseases, reabsorption of divalent cations (such as magnesium and calcium) in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop of the kidney is impaired. This results in loss of magnesium and calcium in the urine. * Mitochondriopathies, such as caused by mutations in SARS2, MT-TI or as seen with Kearns-Sayre syndrome. * Other genetic causes of hypomagnesemia, such as mutations in TRPM6, CNNM2, EGF, EGFR, KCNA1 or FAM111A. Many of the proteins encoded by these genes play a role in the transcellular absorption of magnesium in the distal convoluted tubule. =Metabolic abnormalities= * Insufficient selenium, vitamin D or sunlight exposure, or vitamin B6. * Gastrointestinal causes: the distal digestive tract secretes high levels of magnesium. Therefore, secretory diarrhea can cause hypomagnesemia. Thus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Whipple's disease and celiac sprue can all cause hypomagnesemia. * Postobstructive diuresis, diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and kidney transplant. =Other= * Acute myocardial infarction: within the first 48 hours after a heart attack, 80% of patients have hypomagnesemia. This could be the result of an intracellular shift because of an increase in catecholamines. * Malabsorption * Acute pancreatitis * Fluoride poisoning * Massive transfusion (MT) is a lifesaving treatment of hemorrhagic shock, but can be associated with significant complications. Pathophysiology Magnesium is a co-factor in over 300 functions in the body regulating many kinds of biochemical reactions. It is involved in protein synthesis, muscle and nerve functioning, bone development, energy production, the maintenance of normal heart rhythm, and the regulation of glucose and blood pressure, among other important roles. Low magnesium intake over time can increase the risk of illnesses, including high blood pressure and heart disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoporosis, and migraines. There is a direct effect on sodium (Na), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) channels. Magnesium has several effects: =Potassium= Potassium channel efflux is inhibited by magnesium. Thus hypomagnesemia results in an increased excretion of potassium in kidney, resulting in a hypokalaemia. This condition is believed to occur secondary to the decreased normal physiologic magnesium inhibition of the ROMK channels in the apical tubular membrane. In this light, hypomagnesemia is frequently the cause of hypokalaemic patients failing to respond to potassium supplementation. Thus, clinicians should ensure that both Magnesium and Potassium is replaced when deficient. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis should have their magnesium levels monitored to ensure that the serum loss of potassium, which is driven intracellularly by insulin administration, is not exacerbated by additional urinary losses. =Calcium= Release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is inhibited by magnesium. Thus hypomagnesemia results in an increased intracellular calcium level. This inhibits the release of parathyroid hormone, which can result in hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. Furthermore, it makes skeletal and muscle receptors less sensitive to parathyroid hormone. =Arrhythmia= Magnesium is needed for the adequate function of the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in cardiac myocytes, the muscles cells of the heart. A lack of magnesium inhibits reuptake of potassium, causing a decrease in intracellular potassium. This decrease in intracellular potassium results in a tachycardia. =Pre- eclampsia= Magnesium has an indirect antithrombotic effect upon platelets and endothelial function. Magnesium increases prostaglandins, decreases thromboxane, and decreases angiotensin II, microvascular leakage, and vasospasm through its function similar to calcium channel blockers. Convulsions are the result of cerebral vasospasm. The vasodilatatory effect of magnesium seems to be the major mechanism. =Asthma= Magnesium exerts a bronchodilatatory effect, probably by antagonizing calcium-mediated bronchoconstriction. = Neurological effects = *reducing electrical excitation *modulating release of acetylcholine *antagonising N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, an excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and thus providing neuroprotection from excitoxicity. =Homeostasis= Magnesium is abundant in nature. It can be found in green vegetables, chlorophyll (chloroplasts), cocoa derivatives, nuts, wheat, seafood, and meat. It is absorbed primarily in the duodenum of the small intestine. The rectum and sigmoid colon can absorb magnesium. Forty percent of dietary magnesium is absorbed. Hypomagnesemia stimulates and hypermagnesemia inhibits this absorption. The body contains 21‚Äì28 grams of magnesium (0.864‚Äì1.152 mol). Of this, 53% is located in bone, 19% in non-muscular tissue, and 1% in extracellular fluid. For this reason, blood levels of magnesium are not an adequate means of establishing the total amount of available magnesium. The majority of serum magnesium is bound to chelators, including proteins and citrate. Roughly 33% is bound to proteins, and 5‚Äì10% is not bound. This \\"free\\" magnesium is essential in regulating intracellular magnesium. Normal plasma Mg is 1.7‚Äì2.3 mg/dl (0.69‚Äì0.94 mmol/l). The kidneys regulate the serum magnesium. About 2400 mg of magnesium passes through the kidneys daily, of which 5% (120 mg) is excreted through urine. The loop of Henle is the major site for magnesium homeostasis, and 60% is reabsorbed. Magnesium homeostasis comprises three systems: kidney, small intestine, and bone. In the acute phase of magnesium deficiency there is an increase in absorption in the distal small intestine and tubular resorption in the kidneys. When this condition persists, serum magnesium drops and is corrected with magnesium from bone tissue. The level of intracellular magnesium is controlled through the reservoir in bone tissue. Diagnosis Magnesium deficiency is not easy to directly measure. Typically the diagnosis is based on finding low blood magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia). Specifically by finding a plasma magnesium concentration of less than 0.6 mmol/l (1.46 mg/dl). Severe disease generally has a level of less than 0.50 mmol/l (1.25 mg/dl). Magnesium deficiency (or depletion) refers to low total body levels of magnesium which is usually determined by finding low blood levels (hypomagnesemia). Hypomagnesemia refers only to blood levels of magnesium. Either of magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia can be present without the other. =Electrocardiogram= The electrocardiogram (ECG) change may show a tachycardia with a prolonged QT interval. Other changes may include prolonged PR interval, ST segment depression, flipped T waves, and long QRS duration. Treatments Treatment of hypomagnesemia depends on the degree of deficiency and the clinical effects. Replacement by mouth is appropriate for people with mild symptoms, while intravenous replacement is recommended for people with severe effects. Numerous oral magnesium preparations are available. In two trials of magnesium oxide, one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight, was less bioavailable than magnesium citrate, chloride, lactate or aspartate. Magnesium citrate has been reported as more bioavailable than oxide or amino-acid chelate forms. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) can be given in response to heart arrhythmias to correct for hypokalemia, preventing pre-eclampsia, and has been suggested as having a potential use in asthma. =Food= Food sources of magnesium include leafy green vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds. Epidemiology The condition is relatively common among people in hospital. History Magnesium deficiency in humans was first described in the medical literature in 1934. Plants A plant with magnesium deficiency Magnesium deficiency is a detrimental plant disorder that occurs most often in strongly acidic, light, sandy soils, where magnesium can be easily leached away. Magnesium is an essential macronutrient constituting 0.2-0.4% of plants' dry matter and is necessary for normal plant growth. Excess potassium, generally due to fertilizers, further aggravates the stress from magnesium deficiency, as does aluminium toxicity. Magnesium has an important role in photosynthesis because it forms the central atom of chlorophyll. Therefore, without sufficient amounts of magnesium, plants begin to degrade the chlorophyll in the old leaves. This causes the main symptom of magnesium deficiency, interveinal chlorosis, or yellowing between leaf veins, which stay green, giving the leaves a marbled appearance. Due to magnesium's mobile nature, the plant will first break down chlorophyll in older leaves and transport the Mg to younger leaves which have greater photosynthetic needs. Therefore, the first sign of magnesium deficiency is the chlorosis of old leaves which progresses to the young leaves as the deficiency progresses. Magnesium also acts as an activator for many critical enzymes, including ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), both essential enzymes in carbon fixation. Thus low amounts of Mg lead to a decrease in photosynthetic and enzymatic activity within the plants. Magnesium is also crucial in stabilizing ribosome structures, hence, a lack of magnesium causes depolymerization of ribosomes leading to premature aging of the plant. After prolonged magnesium deficiency, necrosis and dropping of older leaves occurs. Plants deficient in magnesium also produce smaller, woodier fruits. Magnesium deficiency in plants may be confused with zinc or chlorine deficiencies, viruses, or natural aging, since all have similar symptoms. Adding Epsom salts (as a solution of 25 grams per liter or 4 oz per gal) or crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil can rectify magnesium deficiencies. An organic treatment is to apply compost mulch, which can prevent leaching during excessive rainfall and provide plants with sufficient amounts of nutrients, including magnesium.

Being the largest sports venue in Armenia, Hrazdan was mostly used for football matches. It was the home stadium of the Armenian national team until 1999 and has hosted the occasional international game since then. The stadium is able to host 54,208 spectatorsHrazdan Holding:Sports Complex after the most recent reconstruction in 2008, which converted the stadium into an all-seater one. Before the reconstruction, Hrazdan was able to hold up to 70,000 spectators. It was among the top four stadiums of the Soviet Union by its capacity. The stadium hosted the Armenian Cup finals on many occasions, as well as the opening ceremony of the Pan-Armenian Games in 2003. The USSR national team played two games, against Finland and Greece, in Hrazdan in 1978. History =Origin and construction= The earliest idea of building a football stadium in the valley of Hrazdan river was proposed by the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan in his visit to Yerevan in the 1950s. During his stay at the presidential mansion on a hill overlooking the Hrazdan river, he observed a \\"natural amphitheater\\" in Hrazdan gorge and proposed the construction of a football venue with a capacity of 30,000 seats. However, the idea never became serious during that period. In 1967, the authorities of Soviet Armenia launched a serious program to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the sovietization of Armenia in 1970. A group of architects, led by former weightlifter Koryun Hakopyan and former fencer Gurgen Musheghyan proposed the construction plan of a football stadium in Hrazdan gorge, to host around 75,000 spectators. A total amount of 5 million rubles was allocated for the project. The construction works were launched during the second half of 1969 and with the financial support of Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, completed in a remarkable period of 18 months. The construction process was highly supervised by the Communist leader Karen Demirchyan. Finally, the venue became ready in November 1970. The official opening of the stadium took place on November 29, 1970 with the presence of Leonid Brezhnev, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Armenian SSR. However, the planned ceremony for the opening day was postponed due to heavy snow. Hrazdan Stadium hosted its first official football match on May 19, 1971 when Ararat Yerevan defeated Kairat Almaty 3-0 in front of 78,000 spectators, with Alexandr Kovalenko (58th min), Oganes Zanazanyan (74th min. pen.) and Nikolai Kazaryan (77th min.) scoring for the hosts.Soviet top league 1971 General view of the stadium The stadium hosted some glorious moments of the Armenian football during Soviet era. The Armenians celebrated Ararat Yerevan's double of the Soviet football in 1973, which allowed them to play in the European Cup. Reaching the quarterfinals, they lost the first leg to the defending and future champions Bayern Munich with a result of 2-0 while they won the 2nd leg 1-0 in Hrazdan stadium in front of more than 70,000 spectators. In 1985, Hrazdan was one of the venues of the FIFA World Youth Championsh took place in the Soviet Union. It hosted the matches of the 1st group as well as a match during the quarter finals. After the independence of Armenia, the arena hosted the matches of the national team until 1999 when the smaller Republican Stadium in downtown Yerevan became its home ground. The largest number of spectators for the National team was recorded on October 9, 1996, in a 1998 World Cup qualification match against Germany. Attended by 42,000 fans, the match ended in a 5-1 win for Germany. =Architectural team= The history of the stadium is closely related with the history of Armenian football. The Stadium which was built in a record period of 18 months, is the first in the world that was built in a mountainous landscape. The architects of the stadium were Koryun Hakobyan and Gurgen Musheghyan from Armenia. The construction process was supervised by engineer Edward Tossunian. The architectural group of the stadium was granted the award of the best construction of the year in 1971 and honoured by the Soviet Government.Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia vol.7-1981, article:Stadium (Marzadasht in Armenian) Renovation The stadium in 2008 In 2003 the stadium was privatized and sold to the Hrazdan Holding CJSC, who began to set up a renovation process in 2005. By the end of 2008 the stadium became all-seater. Shortly after its renovation the Stadium hosted Armenia's match against Turkey on 6 September 2008, which was the first match Armenia had played at ground since a Euro 2000 qualifying match against France on 8 September 1999. The crucial match was attended by presidents Serzh Sargsyan and Abdullah Gul, with the presence of more than 30,000 spectators. After the 2008 renovation, Hrazdan held UEFA three-star status until that rating was superseded by a new system of classification. According to the president of Armenian Football Federation Ruben Hayrapetyan, a total of 6 million Euros will be spent for the modernization of the infrastructure, the pitch, the running track and the installation of a full-tribune cover for the stadium. After the upcoming renovation, the stadium will have an opportunity to bid as a host-venue for UEFA club competitions final matches.EUR 6 million for reconstruction of Hrazdan stadium in Armenia's capital The renovation works began in March.Renovation of \\"Hrazdan\\" stadium An estimated US$ 10 million was invested. ’å’∏÷Ç’¢’•’∂ ’Ä’°’µ÷Ä’°’∫’•’ø’µ’°’∂’® ‘±’∑’∏’ø ‘±’≤’°’¢’°’¢’µ’°’∂’´ ’∏÷Ç’≤’•’Ø÷Å’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’¥’¢ ’Æ’°’∂’∏’©’°÷Å’°’æ ¬´’Ä÷Ä’°’¶’§’°’∂’´¬ª ’∑’´’∂’°’∑’≠’°’ø’°’∂÷Ñ’∂’•÷Ä’´’∂ (’¨’∏÷Ç’Ω’°’∂’Ø’°÷Ä’∂’•÷Ä, ’ø’•’Ω’°’∂’µ’∏÷Ç’©) Attendance records =Famous concerts= In 1989, a year after the 1988 Armenian earthquake that killed 25,000 people and left more than 500,000 homeless, along with the break out of the Karabakh movement and the rise of nationalism, hundreds of thousands of Armenians were looking for some kind of temporary diversion from the devastation and feeling the importance of national activities. More than 110,000 fans packed the Hrazdan stadium to hear revolutionary and patriotic songs performed by the Armenian famous singer Harout Pamboukjian.

He is especially noted for his definitive three-volume work, Magistrates of the Roman Republic (1951-1986). Life and career Broughton was born in 1900 in Corbetton, Ontario. He attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto. There he received a B.A. in 1921 with honors in classics. He earned his M.A. in 1922. After studying at the University of Chicago, he was made a Rogers Fellow at Johns Hopkins University, where he received a Ph.D. in Latin in 1928, having studied under the famed ancient historian Tenney Frank (1876-1939). He began his teaching career at Victoria College, Toronto. Broughton would go on to teach at Amherst College, Bryn Mawr College (1928-1965) and, later, serve as George L. Paddison Professor of Latin at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1965-1971), where the Library Epigraphy Room, created at his behest, remains a seminal resource. Although he retired from UNC in 1971 (then aged 71), he would continue to work and advise students until his death in 1993. In 1931, he married Annie Leigh Hobson Broughton of Norfolk, Virginia. They had two children, Margaret Broughton Tenney and T. Alan Broughton (b. 1936), a poet and pianist and professor emeritus of the University of Vermont. Mrs. Broughton died on September 19, 2005, in Charleston, South Carolina.http://www.brynmawr.edu/emeritus/obit.html#broughton Magistrates of the Roman Republic Broughton's main scholarly work was his massive, three- volume Magistrates of the Roman Republic (commonly abbreviated MRR), published 1951 to 1986 and requiring more than 30 years to complete. The project provides an unparalleled accounting of the names of men elected to office during the Roman Republic and has become a standard reference work. It provides a year-by-year list of all known office-holders, including not only the magistracies of the cursus honorum from consul to quaestor, but also promagistracies and military commands in the provinces, legates (both official and ad hoc), military prefects, priesthoods, and special commissions. Each entry is documented with ancient sources and selected works of modern scholarship. An index by name, listing each man's known offices, appears in volume 2. In 1953 the Magistrates of the Roman Republic was recognized with the Goodwin Award of Merit from the American Philological Association.Goodwin Award of Merit - Previous Winners http://apaclassics.org/awards-and- fellowships/goodwin-award-of-merit-previous-winners Achievements and awards Broughton's career included a variety of academic appointments and awards: visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, Simon F. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow, holder of a Fulbright research grant to Italy and professor in charge of the School of Classical Studies of the American Academy in Rome. Broughton served as president of the American Philological Association and as vice president of the International Federation of Societies of Classical Studies for 10 years. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute and a corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. Three universities awarded him honorary LL.D. degrees: Johns Hopkins University in 1969, the University of Toronto in 1971 and UNC in 1974. After Broughton's death in September 1993, a Colloquium was organised for November 1994 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in honour of his memory. The papers delivered on this occasion, including those by eminent scholars such as T.P. Wiseman, Erich S. Gruen, and Ernst Badian, later formed the basis of the honorific volume Imperium Sine Fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic, edited by J. Linderski.

The stadium was inaugurated in 1972 with a capacity of 95,000. It served as the main stadium of the 1975 Mediterranean Games, the 1978 All-Africa Games, the 2004 Pan Arab Games, and the 2007 All-Africa Games. The stadium was one of two venues of the 1990 African Cup of Nations (the other venue was the Stade 19 Mai 1956 in Annaba). It hosted 9 matches of the tournament, including the final match, which had a second record attendance of 105,302 spectators. In the final match, the home team Algeria defeated Nigeria 1-0 to win the tournament. The record attendance is of 110,000 spectators in the friendly match between Algeria and Serbia on 3 March 2010. It also hosted the 2000 African Championships in Athletics. After a formal compliance with current safety standards in 1999, the stadium was reduced to an 80,200 capacity, and following a new phase of renovation in 2003, the stadium's capacity has been reduced further to its current all-seater capacity of 64,000. The future capacity will be 80,000 with possible further renovations.  History  Opened in 1972 by President Houari Boumediene, it is home then the first tournament international networking selection Maghreb with players such qu'Allal, Filali, Bamous, Faras, Lalmas, Guedioura, Chekroun, the AC Milan with the Prati Albertosi, the Brazilian club Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras with the famous Ademir da Guia.

Then follow the Games Mediterranean, which are organized in 1975, the stadium had a capacity of seats. But the record attendance was achieved in 1990, when the final of the African Cup of Nations, which contrasts the Algeria and Nigeria (1-0), with spectators. After compliance with current safety standards 1999, the stadium is reduced to places around, and following a new phase of renovation in 2003, the capacity is further reduced to seats. In 2008, Stade 5 Juillet 1962 once again experienced work, which shall include installation by Queens Grass Netherlands company to a new lawn and renovation of the stadium infrastructure. The works ended in the month of August 2009. The soccer friendly match between the national football teams of Algeria and Uruguay was held on August 12, 2009 on the occasion of the reopening of the stadium. The Algerians with a record of final spectators during the friendly match Algeria-Serbia (lost 0-3, March 3, 2010). This is the first game of the Algerian national team since its qualification for the 2010 World Cup obtained in Sudan. In March 2015, the natural sport turf has been replaced by the hybrid grass technology AirFibr.  History of the stadium  = Opening the stadium = After the independence of Algeria, Algeria was very popular for football, especially as it was associated with the sacrifices of Algerians in the glorious liberation revolution and the sacrifices of the FLN players with wealth, money and fame in the finest French clubs in exchange for forming a team representing Algeria in tournaments and demonstrations. The construction of a large stadium in Algeria was an encouraging step for football and a step towards its support after independence by the late President Houari Boumediene. The date of the launching of the works during 1970 and the work lasted two years. The stadium was opened on 17 June 1972 with a speech by President Houari Boumedienne in a friendly tournament involving 4 teams: the Arab Maghreb, AC Milan, Hungary and Palmeiras. The first goal of the stadium was for the Moroccan player Filali for the Maghreb team against Hungary, as the first official game on the pitch was the final of the Cup of Algeria 1972 between the two teams of the capital USM Alger and Hamra Annaba was the first official goal of the stadium to the Hamra Annaba player Tadjet where he won the meeting and the cup, as for the first game for the Algerian team on the pitch was in front of the Turkish team and won the Algerian team 1-0.

The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the Middle Triassic epoch and is followed by the Early Jurassic epoch. The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages. Many of the first dinosaurs evolved during the Late Triassic, including Plateosaurus, Coelophysis, and Eoraptor. Carnian Age The Carnian Age is the first stage of the three to occur during the duration of the mass extinction era. The Carnian age developed about 228 to 217 million years ago, and signals the start of the Late Triassic Epoch. The Carnian stage can further be broken down to relative species activity during the time, based on fossils and evidence found dating back to this time period. For example, marine life such as serenites nanseni and Trachyceras Obesum can be dated back to the early Carnian stage. Meanwhile, Tropites Dilleri, Tropites Welleri and klamathites macrolobatus can all be dated back to the late Carnian stage, During the Carnian era, archosaurs took on a powerful role in existence and domination in terms of land and resources. The archosaur species included animals similar to today's crocodile and general large lizards. Many families of prehistoric animals existed during this time period, such as the phytosaurs, ornithosuchids, prestosuchids, rauisuchids and poposaur archosaurs populated many areas of the earth, and were scattered among areas such as today's India, North America, South America, Africa and Britain. Evidence of fossils of such prehistoric animals have been found in these parts of the world. However, during the Carnian time period, separation of the northern areas began to occur, which separated the Laurasian supercontinent existing at the time. In addition, the Gondwanaland supercontinent of the South also began to separate and disperse itself. However, Pangaea was still intact at this time. During these land mass separations, regions were extremely tectonically active, which caused cataclysmic flows of lava, which would eventually lead to rift lines and land separation. Inevitably, this signified the start to the eventual Late Triassic mass extinction. Norian Age The Norian age is the second stage of the three to occur during the duration of the Triassic mass extinction. This stage developed about 217 to 204 million years ago. This stage comes after the Carnian stage, and is known for its rising populations of mesozoic organisms as well as the decline in populations of previous species that had once played important roles in the environment. This stage identifies with its own species of ammonoid index fossils, which is how it differs from the preceding Carnian stage. In this stage, fossils and evidence of Cyrtopleurites bicrenatus are found in these different areas of the world, which seem to be more complex and advanced than those in the preceding stage of the era. Many species alive during the Norian age that eventually became extinct lived either in the Tethys-Panthalassan reef province, or the West Pangean reef province. in the Tethys-Panthalassan province, species saw considerable amounts of populations becoming extinct here. Species such as the sphinctozoid as well as other species began dying out, and by the end of the Norian stage, about 90% of these species evolved and remained in the area. Further evidence shows that scientists discovered major rises in sea level towards later years of the stage, in which new taxa came into play. Rhaetian Age The Rhaetian age was the final stage of the Triassic era's mass extinction, in succession to the Norian stage, and was last major disruption of life until the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. This stage of the Triassic is known for its extinction of marine reptiles, such as nothosaurs and shashtosaurs with the ichthyosaurs, similar to today's dolphin. This stage was concluded with the disappearance of many species that removed types of plankton from the face of the earth, as well as some organisms known for reef-building, and the pelagic conodonts. In addition to these species that became extinct, the straight-shelled nautoloids, placodonts, bivalves and many types of reptiles did not survive through this stage. Climate and environment during the Triassic Period During the beginning of the Triassic Era, the earth consisted of a giant landmass known as Pangea, which covered about a quarter of earth's surface. Towards the end of the era, continental drift occurred which separated Pangea. At this time, polar ice was not present because of the large differences between the equator and the poles. A single, large landmass similar to Pangea would be expected to have extreme seasons; however, evidence offers contradictions. Evidence suggests that there is arid climate as well as proof of strong precipitation. The planet's atmosphere and temperature components were mainly warm and dry, with other seasonal changes in certain ranges. The Middle Triassic was known to have consistent intervals of high levels of humidity. The circulation and movement of these humidity patterns, geographically, are not known however. The major Carnian Pluvial Event stands as one focus point of many studies. Different hypotheses of the events occurrence include eruptions, monsoonal effects, and changes caused by plate tectonics. Continental deposits also support certain ideas relative to the Triassic period. Sediments that include red beds, which are sandstones and shales of color, may suggest seasonal precipitation. Rocks also included dinosaur tracks, mudcracks, and fossils of crustaceans and fish, which provide climate evidence, since animals and plants can only live during periods of which they can survive through. =Evidence of environmental disruption and climate change= The Late Triassic is described as semiarid. Semiarid is characterized by light rainfall, having up to 10‚Äì20 inches of precipitation a year. The period had a fluctuating, warm climate in which it was occasionally marked by instances of powerful heat. Different basins in certain areas of Europe provided evidence of the emergence of the ‚ÄúMiddle Carnian Pluvial Event.\\" For example, the Western Tethys and German Basin was defined by the theory of a middle Carnian wet climate phase. This event stands as the most distinctive climate change within the Triassic period. Propositions for its cause include: * Different behaviors of atmospheric or oceanic circulation forced by plate tectonics that may have participated in modifying the carbon cycle and other scientific factors. * heavy rains due to shifting of the earth * sparked by eruptions, typically originating from an accumulation of igneous rocks, which could have included liquid rock or volcanic rock formations Theories and concepts are supported universally, due to extensive areal proof of Carnian siliciclastic sediments. The physical positions as well as comparisons of that location to surrounding sediments and layers stood as basis for recording data. Multiple resourced and recurring patterns in results of evaluations allowed for the satisfactory clarification of facts and common conceptions on the Late Triassic. Conclusions summarized that the correlation of these sediments led to the modified version of the new map of Central Eastern Pangea, as well as that the sediment's relation to the ‚ÄúCarnian Pluvial Event‚Äù is greater than expected. * High interest concerning the Triassic period has fueled the need to uncover more information about the time period's climate. The Late Triassic period is classified as a phase entirely flooded with phases of monsoonal events. A monsoon affects large regions and brings heavy rains along with powerful winds. Field studies confirm the impact and occurrence of strong monsoonal circulation during this time frame. However, hesitations concerning climatic variability remains. Upgrading knowledge on the climate of a period is a difficult task to assess. Understanding of and assumptions of temporal and spatial patterns of the Triassic period's climate variability still need revision. Diverse proxies hindered the flow of palaeontological evidence. Studies in certain zones are missing and could be benefited by collaborating the already existing but uncompared records of Triassic palaeoclimate. * A specific physical piece of evidence was found. A fire scar on the trunk of a tree, found in southeast Utah, dates back to the Late Triassic. The feature was evaluated and paved the path to the conclusion of one fire's history. It was categorized through comparison of other modern tree scars. The scar stood as evidence of Late Triassic wildfire, an old climatic event. Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event The extinction event that began during the Late Triassic resulted in the disappearance of about 76% of all terrestrial and marine life species, as well as almost 20% of taxonomic families. Although the Late Triassic Epoch did not prove to be as destructive as the preceding Permian Period, which took place approximately 50 million years earlier and destroyed about 70% of land species, 57% of insect families as well as 95% of marine life, it resulted in great decreased in population sizes of many living organism populations. The environment of the Late Triassic had negative effects on the conodonts and ammonoid groups. These groups once served as vital index fossils, which made it possible to identify feasible life span to multiple strata of the Triassic strata. These groups were severely affected during the epoch, and became extinct soon after(Conodonts). Despite the large populations that withered away with the coming of the Late Triassic, many families, such as the pterosaurs, crocodiles, mammals and fish were very minimally affected. However, such families as the bivalves, gastropods, marine reptiles and brachiopods were greatly affected and many species became extinct during this time. =Causes of the extinction= Most of the evidence suggests the increase of volcanic activity was the main cause of the extinction. As a result of the rifting of the super continent Pangea, there was an increase in widespread volcanic activity which released large amounts of carbon dioxide. At the end of the Triassic period, massive eruptions occurred along the rift zone, known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, for about 500,000 years. These intense eruptions were classified as flood basalt eruptions, which are a type of large scale volcanic activity that releases a huge volume of lava in addition to sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The sudden increase in carbon dioxide levels is believed to have enhanced the greenhouse effect, which acidified the oceans and raised average air temperature. As a result of the change in biological conditions in the oceans, 22% of marine families became extinct. In addition, 53% of marine genera and about 76‚Äì86% of all species became extinct, which vacated ecological niches; thus, enabling dinosaurs to become the dominant presence in the Jurassic period. While the majority of the scientists agree that volcanic activity was the main cause of the extinction, other theories suggest the extinction was triggered by the impact of an asteroid, climate change, or rising sea levels. =Biological impact= The impacts that the Late Triassic era had on surrounding environments and organisms were wildfire destruction of habitats and prevention of photosynthesis. Climatic cooling also occurred due to the soot in the atmosphere. Studies also show that 103 families of marine invertebrates became extinct at the end of the Triassic, yet another 175 lived on into the jurassic. Marine and extant species were hit fairly hard by extinctions during this period. Almost 20% of 300 extant families became extinct, and Bivalves, Cephalopods, and Brachiopods suffered greatly. 92% of Bivalves were wiped out episodically throughout the Triassic. The end of the Triassic also brought about the decline of corals and reef builders during what is called a ‚Äúreef gap‚Äù. The changes in sea levels brought this decline upon corals, particularly the Calcisponges and Scleractinian corals. However, some corals would make a resurgence during the Jurassic period. 17 Brachiopod species were also wiped out by the end of the Triassic. Furthermore, Conulariids became entirely extinct.

Its partners, Albert Sands Southworth (1811‚Äì1894) and Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808‚Äì1901), have been hailed as the first great American masters of photography, whose work elevated photographic portraits to the level of fine art. Their images are prominent in every major book and collection of early American photography. Southworth & Hawes worked almost exclusively in the daguerreotype process. Working in the 8 ¬Ω x 6 ¬Ω inch whole plate format, their images are brilliant, mirror-like, and finely detailed. Writing in the Photographic and Fine Art Journal, August 1855, the contemporary Philadelphia daguerreotypist Marcus Aurelius Root paid them this praise: \\"Their style, indeed, is peculiar to themselves; presenting beautiful effects of light and shade, and giving depth and roundness together with a wonderful softness or mellowness. These traits have achieved for them a high reputation with all true artists and connoisseurs.\\" He further noted that the firm had devoted their time chiefly to daguerreotypes, with little attention to photography on paper.

Winthrop. = Documenting the birth of surgical anesthesia = Ether Anesthesia Delivered at Massachusetts General Hospital, Spring 1847; daguerreotype by Southworth & Hawes. On the evening of September 30, 1846, Mr. Eben Frost, suffering from a violent toothache, called upon Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, a dentist at No. 19 Tremont Row, Boston. Dr. Morton administered nitrous oxide and extracted the tooth. Less than three weeks later, the so- called \\"Death of Pain\\" took place on October 16, when Dr. Morton administered ether to a patient before Dr. John Collins Warren, senior surgeon at the Massachusetts General Hospital, removed a tumor from his neck. Although it is believed that ether anesthesia had been administered for surgery earlier, most notably by Dr. Crawford Long in Jefferson Georgia on March 30, 1843, it had been done privately and not reported in the medical literature. Morton's public demonstration of general anesthesia was therefore historic. To commemorate this momentous event, Southworth & Hawes were asked to daguerreotype the operation; however Hawes was squeamish about the blood, and they photographed a re-enactment instead. On April 3, 1847, Southworth & Hawes were called upon to record an actual operation, again with the patient under ether. Later Dr. Warren presented his Laundy scalpel and probe, the surgical instruments he used in the first operation, to Hawes in gratitude for recording the operations. (Three or four weeks later, they documented Dr. Warren yet again. In honor of his ether discovery, and of his distinguished career as professor of anatomy at Harvard Medical School, they arranged and composed a mock anatomy dissection, with the principal subject being Dr. Warren himself.) = Dispersion of the archives = Hawes lived until 1901, continuing to operate a studio and carefully protecting its sizeable archive. The archives were finally dispersed during the Great Depression. Most made their way into three museums (George Eastman House, Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), while only a comparatively few have ever been privately held. However, on April 27, 1999, a previously unknown hoard of 240 Southworth & Hawes daguerreotypes appeared at Sotheby's auction from the estate of David Feigenbaum. The total sales price realized was $3.3 million.

The leaves were shucked off and the golden ears were thrown in a wooden wagon pulled by a team of mules. This was Cornjerking, In other parts of the United States, this harvesting process may have been known as corn snapping, corn shucking, or corn husking. The many laborers who walked the fields to harvest the crops were called Cornjerkers. The invention of the corn picking machine has made this hand harvesting process obsolete. By using modern machines, a farmer is capable of tending larger fields, thus producing more food with less effort. As a result, the term Cornjerker as used in the agricultural industry has become a colloquialism. Hoopeston Hoopeston, Illinois has long been known as the \\"Sweetcorn Capital of the World.\\" In the 1920s the term Cornjerker was first applied to the athletic teams of the school just as the Pittsburgh Steelers got their name from that town's steel- mills. Bob Poisall, a sports writer for the Commercial-News (Danville, Illinois), is credited with first coining the team name. From the information available, the name was a joke that stuck. In the fall, the team buses to games were often late in leaving because the teams' members were still in the fields jerking corn. Per the custom at that time, Mr. Poisall was riding the team bus in order to cover the game for his newspaper. In exasperation on one of these occasions, he told them they would never get anywhere, they were just a bunch of cornjerkers. Glenn Brasel, coach of Hoopeston High School from 1922 through 1946, must have liked the term and felt it would be an appropriate team name. The emblem of an ear of corn first appeared on the team uniform in 1930. In 1963, the mascot known as \\"Jerky\\" was born. This walking ear of corn was created by coach and athletic director at that time, Dick Hobbs. Cornjerkers come in all shapes and sexes. Brawny football players, lanky basketball players, speedy track team members, petite cheerleaders - all of these students are Cornjerkers. Coaches, faculty, and fans are also a part of the Cornjerkers. Originally, Cornjerkers were from Hoopeston. One of their rivals were the East Lynn Hornets. In 1973, the Hornets were turned into Cornjerkers - Hoopeston and East Lynn schools consolidated. Later, with the addition of nearby towns Cheneyville, East Lynn, Wellington and Rankin, the name was changed to its current form, \\"Hoopeston Area\\". On March 16, 1985, the best known Cornjerkers were members of the varsity basketball team. The team was ranked number three in the state of Illinois in Class A basketball. According to Don Dukes, then-Mayor of Hoopeston, \\" After this past weekend, there should not be anyone in the state of Illinois who doesn't know what a Cornjerker is and where one comes from.\\" Notable former Cornjerkers *Thad Matta, 1980s Cornjerker basketball star and former NCAA head men's basketball coach (Ohio State) *Herb Neathery, Hoopeston High School class of 1948, went on to play NCAA class football at the University of Illinois.

It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. The compound has a paddle-wheel configuration with D3h symmetry. It is named after the medieval three-piece art panel, the triptych. Several substituted triptycenes are known. Barrelenes are structurally related. Due to the rigid framework and three-dimensional geometry, derivatives of triptycene have been well researched. Synthesis The parent triptycene was first prepared in 1942 by a multistep method. It can also be prepared in one step in 28% yield from the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction of anthracene and benzyne. In this method, benzyne is generated by the reaction of magnesium and 2-bromofluorobenzene. Derivatives and applications The hydrocarbon framework is very rigid and triptycene derivatives such as triptycene quinones are therefore incorporated in many organic compounds as a molecular scaffold for various applications, such as molecular motors or ligands. For example, a bis(diphenylphosphino) derivative was used as a phosphine ligand on nickel in a highly selective hydrocyanation reaction of butadiene: The reactivity of this catalyst is attributed to the large bite angle of the bidentate ligand supported by the triptycene framework.

A 1965/66 Moulton \\"New Look\\" Standard M1 bicycle Biography Moulton was educated at Marlborough College and King's College, Cambridge. He was the great-grandson of the rubber pioneer Stephen Moulton, the founder of the family business George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd., in which he worked after World War II, specialising in rubber suspension systems for vehicles. His father, John Coney Moulton, was a naturalist working in the Far East. During the war he worked on engine design at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. In the late 1950s, after the acquisition of the family business by the Avon Rubber Company, Moulton started up a new company, Moulton Developments Limited, to design the suspension system for British Motor Corporation's new small car, the Mini, that was being designed by his friend Sir Alec Issigonis. The combination of conical rubber springs and small wheels was one of the many innovative developments that allowed Issigonis to achieve the Mini's small overall size. This was later refined into the hydrolastic and hydragas suspension systems used on later British Leyland cars such as the Austin Maxi, Austin Allegro, Princess and Rover Metro, and most recently on the MGF. Moulton also designed the Moulton Bicycle, again using rubber suspension and small wheels. Moulton Bicycle Company is based in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, England. Awards and honours In 1976, Moulton was awarded the CBE for services to industry. Other honours include: *The Diploma di Medaglia d'Oro, Milan (1964) *Queen's Award for Technical Innovation (1967) *Honorary Doctorates from the Royal College of Art (1967), University of Bath (1971) and Cranfield University (1994) *Elected to the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry (1968), Master of the Faculty from 1981 to 1983 *Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering (1980) *Vice-President of the Royal Academy of Engineering from 1985 to 1988 *He has an entry in the Golden Book of Cycling, which he signed when he was 71 *In 1997 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists Dr Moulton died on 9 December 2012 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath. His funeral, which was attended by 'Moultoneers' from all over the world, took place at Holy Trinity Church at Bradford-on-Avon on 19 December, after which he was interred in the family grave at Christ Church in the same town beside his great-grandfather, Stephen Moulton, who founded the Moulton dynasty in the Wiltshire town in 1848.

He was the first bowler from Derbyshire to take 100 wickets in a season, a feat he performed three times.  Cricket career  He made his debut for Derbyshire against Lancashire in May 1897. During his time at Derbyshire, he was partnered by Billy Bestwick in a dangerous fast-bowling partnership that never gained much reward because they had very small totals to bowl at. Though rarely judged a better bowler than Bestwick, it was owing to his superiority as a batsman and fieldsman that Warren gained the pair's only England cap against Australia at Headingley in 1905. He played in the Headingley (Leeds) Ashes Test of 1905. A very tall, right-arm fast bowler who operated off a long, bounding approach, he took 5 for 57 in the first innings of a drawn match. Although he dismissed the cream of Australia's batting, taking the prized wicket of Victor Trumper in both innings, he was not selected again. In 1910, when playing against Warwickshire at Blackwell Warren scored 123 in less than three hours in a ninth-wicket stand of 283 with John Chapman. This remains a world record in all first-class cricket.  Football career  Warren played as an outside right in the Football League for Derby County and in the Southern League for Brentford in the early 1900s. He also played non-league football for Heanor Town and Ripley Athletic. Warren's Brentford career ended when he was jailed for six months for causing an affray in a local pub.  First World War  Despite being 40 years old and not eligible to serve, Warren lied about his age and enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. He suffered upper body wounds from a shell blast in France in 1917 and was discharged in February 1919, three months after the armistice. Warren reached the rank of lance bombardier.  Personal life  Warren was born in Codnor, Derbyshire, the son of John Warren, a builder, and his wife Mary. Warren died in his hometown at the age of 76.

Long residing in the United Kingdom, Minogue was a prominent part of the intellectual life of British conservatism. Associated for much of his career with the London School of Economics, where he was Professor of Political Science from 1984 to 1995, he was described as a central figure in a group of prominent conservative philosophers and commentators at the LSE that included Maurice Cranston, Elie Kedourie, and William Letwin. Biography Minogue was born on 11 September 1930 in Palmerston North, New Zealand. He was educated in Australia, attending Sydney Boys High School and the University of Sydney. Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950, his time there was influenced by John Anderson, who had built up a reputation on campus for his firm belief in free speech, secularism, and anti-communism. Minogue was involved in student journalism ‚Äì which he admitted was to the detriment of his studies ‚Äì and wrote for Honi Soit and a short-lived free-thinking broadsheet, Heresy. Friends included Murray Sayle and Peter Coleman. Deciding to move to England, Minogue made his way there by working as a cabin boy on a ship bound for London via Odessa and Port Said, and, once arrived, soon found himself lodging at a hostel in Russell Square. After a brief stint as a freelance writer, he found steadier income by working as a supply teacher with the London Education Authority for eighteen months. Turned down for a masters degree at the LSE, he instead enrolled for a second undergraduate evening school course in Economics at the same institution. Following graduation he spent a year teaching at the University of Exeter, and returned to the LSE as assistant lecturer in 1956 at the invitation of Michael Oakeshott, where he would spend the rest of his academic life. Career Minogue wrote academic essays and books on a great range of problems in political theory. He first came to public attention with his 1961 book The Liberal Mind, which criticised the 'drift' toward collectivism and progressivism in Britain's post-war consensus, which he believed acted as a 'prop to the mediocre' and deprived individuals of personal initiative. A running theme in the book was Minogue's distate for the 'melodrama of oppressors and victims' that he saw as constituting liberal historiography. Minogue, who described Liberalism as the first 'modern ideology', also reflected on what he argued was the second ‚Äì Nationalism ‚Äì in his 1967 book of the same name. As far as Minogue was concerned, if the liberal view of history tended to the ahistorical, then nationalist ideology was guilty of reducing it to mythology. In 1986 Minogue presented a 6-part television program on Channel 4 about free market economics called The New Enlightenment. He was Senior Research Fellow with the Social Affairs Unit in London. He wrote a study on Maori-PƒÅkehƒÅ relations (the latter is the Maori term for New Zealanders of European descent) for the New Zealand Business Roundtable which was published in 1998 published as Waitangi Morality Reality.Kenneth Minogue Waitangi, Morality Reality , Wellington: New Zealand Business Roundtable, 1998 From 1991 to 1993 Minogue was chairman of the euro- sceptic Bruges Group. From 2000, he was a trustee of Civitas. He served as President of the Mont Pelerin Society from 2010. In 2003, he received the Centenary Medal from the Australian government. He was also involved with the Centre for Policy Studies and the European Foundation. Personal He married firstly, Valerie Pearson Hallett, with whom he had a son and a daughter, in 1954. This marriage was dissolved in 2001. Minogue was later married to Beverly Cohen, who predeceased him. According to Roger Kimball, the two often hosted dinner parties at their London home. He was reportedly a member of the Garrick Club and a keen tennis fan. =Death= Minogue died, aged 82, in Guayaquil, Ecuador, after apparently suffering cardiac arrest on a flight returning from San Crist√≥bal Island in the Galapagos, where he had been hosting a meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society, and was declared dead shortly after his plane landed on the Ecuadorian mainland. On Minogue's legacy, Roger Scruton suggested that Minogue was \\"no mere academic\\" but \\"a model of the conservative activist\\" because \\"he was in the business of defending old- fashioned civility against ideological rage, and he believed this was the real meaning of the freedom that the English-speaking peoples have created and enjoyed.\\" Bibliography *The Liberal Mind (1963) *Nationalism (1967) *The Concept of a University (1974) *Contemporary Political Philosophers (1976) *Alien Powers: The Pure Theory of Ideology (1985) *Thatcherism: Personality and Politics (ed, 1987) *Politics: A Very Short Introduction (1995) *Conservative Realism: New Essays in Conservatism (ed, 1996) *The Silencing of Society (1997) *Waitangi: Morality and Reality (1998) *The Servile Mind: How Democracy Erodes the Moral Life (2010) References External links * Daily Telegraph obituary * Kenneth Minogue by John O'Sullivan Category:1930 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Academics of the London School of Economics Category:Australian libertarians Category:Australian political philosophers Category:People from Palmerston North Category:Recipients of the Centenary Medal Category:New Zealand libertarians Category:British libertarians Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics ","title":"Kenneth Minogue"},{"id":"3029295","text":"Syncretic politics, or spectral-syncretic politics combine elements from across the conventional left‚Äìright political spectrum.

The main idea of syncretic politics is that taking political positions of neutrality by combining elements associated with the left and right can achieve a goal of reconciliation. A similar approach was taken in a 2019 study titled \\"Limbic Ideological Dimension: A brief description\\" which proposes a limbic dimension in the political spectrum in line with the right, left and centre dimensions by metaphorically relating the existing basic spectrum to the whole brain psychological approach of Ned Herrmann. The aim behind the Limbic categorisation was to combine the elements of right and left political positions.  Historical examples  The Falange of Spain presented itself definitively as syncretic. Falangism has attacked both the left and the right as its \\"enemies\\", declaring itself to be neither left nor right, but a Third Position. Despite this they allied with the nationalist right side during the Civil War. At the peak of the Cold War, the former Argentinian President Juan Per√≥n (1946‚Äì1955; 1973‚Äì1974) defined the international position of his doctrine (Peronism) as a \\"third position\\" between capitalism and communism, a stance which became a precedent of the Non-Aligned Movement. In the United States, Third Way adherents embrace fiscal conservatism to a greater extent than traditional social liberals and advocate some replacement of welfare with workfare and sometimes have a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets) while rejecting pure laissez- faire economics and other right-libertarian positions. This style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the administration of President Bill Clinton. Political scientist Stephen Skowronek introduced the term \\"Third Way\\" into the interpretation of American presidential politics. Such Presidents undermine the opposition by borrowing policies from it in an effort to seize the middle and with it to achieve political dominance. This technique is known as triangulation and was used by Bill Clinton and other New Democrats who sought to move beyond the party's New Deal liberalism reputation in response to the political realignment of the 1980s. Through this strategy, Clinton adopted themes associated with the Republican Party, such as fiscal conservatism, welfare reform, deregulation and law and order policies. Famously, he declared in the 1996 State of the Union Address that \\"the era of big government is over\\". In the United Kingdom, the emergence of New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown was a pitch for the Third Way, mixing economic neoliberal policies, such as banking privatisation, with socially progressive policies.

It was owned by Hollywood stuntman Hal Needham and actor Burt Reynolds. The team made its debut in 1981, fielding the No. 22 Skoal Pontiac driven by Stan Barrett. Barrett ran ten races for the team that season, his best finish coming at Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished 9th. Midseason, Mach 1 created a second car, the No. 33, driven by Harry Gant. Gant did not win that season, but he won three poles and had thirteen top-tens, finishing third in points. In 1982, Gant drove the No. 33 Buick full-time with sponsorship from 7-Eleven/Skoal. He won at Martinsville and Charlotte and finished fourth in points. After just one win the following season, the team switched to Chevrolet, and Gant won three races, finishing a career best second in points. He followed that season up with another three wins in 1985. For the next three years, Gant and Mach 1 failed to visit victory lane. Midway into the 1988 season, Gant suffered injuries at the Coca-Cola 600. Morgan Shepherd filled in for him, and had one top-five and two top-tens. After Gant finished 27th in the final standings, he left the team for Jackson Bros. Motorsports, taking Skoal and No. 33 with him. In 1989, Mach 1 switched to the No. 66 and signed rookie driver Rick Mast. In their first race together, the Daytona 500, Mast drove the unsponsored car to a sixth-place finish, an accomplishment he later said was the one he was the most proud of. Mast and Mach 1 ran twelve more races together that season, they were unable to duplicate that effort. Needham closed the team and sold it to their crew chief, Travis Carter.

He starred in three issues of his own comic, cover-dated September 1966 to February 1967. Spyman #1 contained the first professional comic book works by Jim Steranko. Steranko created the concept and plotted the first story. However, he did not supply any artwork, except the first page splash which includes a diagram of his robot hand. This was one of three concepts Steranko created for Harvey that saw print. Spyman was secret agent Johnny Chance, who lost his left hand defusing a nuclear bomb. Johnny was an agent of the American spy group LIBERTY, headquartered under the Statue of Liberty. After losing his hand, he would be outfitted with an 'Electro Robot Hand', each finger a different tool/weapon. He would soon be outfitted with a belt with extra fingers with additional uses. Chance and LIBERTY fought against MIRAGE (Empire of Guerrilla Assassination, Revenge, and International Menace), led by the Whisperer. Whisperer was killed in the first issue, and Chance would go on to fight Cyclops and the Evil Eye Society in the second issue and the Id Machine in the third. It is unknown who wrote the stories; it may have been editor Joe Simon. Pencil art was by George Tuska with inking by Dick Ayers, with some inks by Reed Crandall, in the first issue.

He is known for co-leading high-impact campaigns, including the historic International Campaign to Ban Landmines, co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, working closely with the late Diana, Princess of Wales and Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan. White is a Senior Ashoka Fellow, recognized for a lifetime of social entrepreneurship in service to humanity. He is a Gabelli Fellow at the Fordham School of Business in NYC, working to scale social innovation through Jesuit institutions worldwide. He co-founded Survivor Corps, formerly Landmine Survivors Network, created by and for survivors to help victims of war rebuild their lives.Chet Cooper, \\"A Step Towards Awareness,\\" Ability Magazine, Aug/Sep 2009. Background In 1984, White lost his leg ‚Äî and almost his life ‚Äî in a landmine accident.Jerry White, I Will Not Be Broken, 2008, Chapter 2. According to an interview he gave to the Israeli Channel 10,\\"London and Kirshenbaum\\", 18 July 2011 he came to Israel to learn Hebrew as part of his studies of Judaism (though his roots are Irish Catholic). On one occasion he visited northern Israel with a few other American backpackers to follow the Biblical prophets' footsteps. When they reached the Banias River in the Golan Heights, they decided to go off the beaten track and set up their camp on a nearby hill, where White stepped on a landmine. He said they later learned that the hill was Tel Azaziat, a former battlefield in which many mines had been laid during the 1960s. White said he was hospitalized in the Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer, and despite having the possibility to receive good medical treatment in the United States, he decided to stay at Tel HaShomer until he was fully recovered and rehabilitated, because he was impressed with the center's methods of rehabilitating people with serious limb injuries. Following this incident, White became a co-founder of Survivor Corps (together with Ken Rutherford). He led efforts to draft and enact human rights and humanitarian laws that promote and protect the rights of 650 million people with disabilities.Cameron MA, Lawson RJ, Tomlin BW. To walk without fear : the global movement to ban landmines. Toronto ; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Chapter 7, \\"The Role of the Landmine Survivors Network,\\" pp. 99-117. White arranged for, and escorted, Diana, Princess of Wales, on her last humanitarian mission, to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then spearheaded efforts to promote a mine-free Middle East with King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan. In 2010, White secured an unprecedented Knesset vote in Israel to clear old minefields, including the Baptism Site of Jesus on the Jordan River. White has appeared and published extensively in the media; testified before the United States Congress and the United Nations; and received several awards in recognition of his humanitarian and human rights leadership, including: the Rumi Award for Interreligious Diplomacy in 2015; the Superior Honor Award from the U.S. State Department in 2014; the Roots of Peace Global Humanitarian Award in 2010; the first International UNA Humanitarian Prize from Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills in 2003; the 2001 Paul G.

Survivor Corps brings conflict survivors together to promote reconciliation and rebuilding through community service projects. White and Rutherford's leadership in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines helped secure the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and the Cluster Munitions Ban Treaty.

He was a very aggressive player, who specialized in pick-and-go techniques.  Rugby career  He was educated at Otago Boys' High School, and originally played for Otago in the NPC and the Highlanders in the Super 14. He moved north in 2004 to play for Waikato and the Chiefs. He is 1.75m tall and weighs 95 kg. He was New Zealand's Super 12 Player of the Year in 1999. Kelleher scoring a try for Toulouse against BiarritzKelleher had signed a contract to play for Agen in the Top 14 after the 2007 Rugby World Cup; however, the club's relegation to the second-level Rugby Pro D2 after the 2006‚Äì07 Top 14 season caused the contract to be cancelled. Kelleher went on to sign with traditional Top 14 powers Toulouse, effective with the end of the Rugby World Cup. He won the \\"Bouclier de Brennus\\" (the French Rugby Union Title) in the 2007‚Äì08 Top 14 season with Stade Toulousain, and was elected by the Top 14 players as the season's best player. In 2010 he played in the final as Toulouse won the Heineken Cup. In 2010, he was selected in the French Barbarians squad to play Tonga on 26 November. He was known as an unpredictable and unorthodox halfback, with his speed and strength, sometimes preferring to run with the ball and make line-breaks rather than passing the ball after rucks and mauls. After his sports retirement, he became an international ambassador for Airbus, a rugby consultant for Sky Sports, acquired half of the shares of Evangelina, a bar-restaurant in Toulouse, opened a consulting company specialised in French lifestyle and rugby and volunteered for a regional French NGO called \\"L'Ombre du Baobab\\" to help children in Sumba island,. Personal life In December 2004, Kelleher met American porn-star Ashley Spalding, better known as Kaylani Lei. They reportedly crossed paths in a \\"hedonism resort\\" in Jamaica then dated and lived together until they split in June 2006. British newspaper The Independent called them \\"a raunchy Antipodean answer to Posh and Becks\\", referring to the high-profile relationship of football player David Beckham and his wife ex-Spice Girl Victoria. In 2009, Kelleher was dating Julie Nov√®s, 22-year-old at the time and daughter of Toulouse manager Guy Nov√®s while he was involved in a car crash and assaulted another driver. The media thought involving his coach's daughter in a car accident would get him in further troubles. A close friend of the Prince and Princess of Monaco, he was one of the guests at the couple's wedding in July 2011. The press suspected he was romantically involved with the Princess and New Zealand beer brand Tui jokingly created billboards referencing to the rumour,. In 2018, Kelleher met Auckland based international flight attendant, Yuliana Desta. Kelleher met Yuliana in Bali. They both currently live between Bali and New Zealand where they set up their property and tourism business together. = Controversies = Kelleher has been involved in several incidents. In October 2009, he was charged for driving under the influence of alcohol and assault. On 11 September, he drove drunk, crashed his car into a Porsche , assault was involved with violence and got arrested by the French police. He received a two-month suspended jail term and was fined on this occasion and was released. He was arrested again in October 2013 for driving on the wrong side of the road while four times over the legal alcohol limit,. In June 2016, he was arrested for destruction and domestic violence. After vandalising a door and verbally attacking a woman he was with, he was taken to a police station and placed in a drunk tank but was released after the women was examined by a doctor and nothing was wrong with her. The woman refused to press charged for fear of reprisals according to French police but lived with Kelleher in a relationship after these accusations . Kelleher was ultimately convicted over the matter in early March 2017 and received a fine, with the prosecutor stating that the \\"violence was not colossal, but strongly existed\\". In September 2015, Byron Kelleher opened a rugby-themed bar in Toulouse named The Haka Corner. Maori motives were used as promotional material and French fans were encouraged to film themselves doing a haka through a Facebook page. In New Zealand, Maori Party leader Te Ururoa Flavell and its predecessor Sir Pita Sharples criticized the use of the Maori culture for business and personal gain. They also deemed the association of Maori culture with alcohol unacceptable. They stressed that Kelleher was not a Maori and therefore should not organize such events,. The Haka Corner later issued a statement claiming the haka challenge was organized to help \\"hospitalised children\\" and was not a promotional tool for the bar. They also said the bar would help French people discover New Zealand culture. Kelleher told a French newspaper that Maori leaders \\"picked up the wrong fight\\" in opposing his haka challenge. New Zealand Rugby also asked for an explanation when they learned The Haka Corner sold official Classic All Blacks clothing altered to include branding for the bar. They declared the All Blacks brand was protected by trademark laws and that a licence was necessary to use it.

In a career mainly associated with Benfica, the central defender also competed professionally in France and the United States, during a 16-year career. He won more than 60 caps for Portugal, being the player with the most appearances for several years. Coelho worked as a manager since 1985, also being in charge of several national teams including his own. Playing career Born in Cedofeita, Porto, Coelho was regarded as one of the best stoppers in Portuguese football, imposing himself in Lisbon-based S.L. Benfica's first team at the age of 18 ‚Äì four years later, he had already played in 101 Primeira Liga matches for the club. On 27 October 1968 he made his debut for Portugal, in a 3‚Äì0 win over Romania for the 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifying stages; during the next 15 years he would appear in a further 63 internationals, scoring six goals while acting as captain on 30 occasions. From 1975 and during two seasons, Coelho played abroad with Paris Saint- Germain FC. He continued to display the traditional attacking penchant in spite of his position as he netted six times in his first year, although the side could only finish in 14th position in Ligue 1. Subsequently, Coelho returned to Benfica, helping to the conquest of a further three leagues and four domestic cups. He last appeared for the national team at the age of 33, during the 0‚Äì5 defeat in the Soviet Union for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifiers ‚Äì Portugal would qualify for the final stages in France, but he was severely injured during that period and retired shortly after, having appeared for his main club in 496 competitive matches (355 in the league alone) and scoring 76 goals. Coaching career More than one decade after starting as a coach, with spells with S.C. Salgueiros and S.C. Braga, both in the top level, Coelho led Portugal to the semi-finals of Euro 2000. However, his contract was not renewed, and late into that same year he was appointed manager of Morocco, being released after the Atlas Lions failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. After a third spell with a national team, South Korea, which ended after roughly one year with the manager claiming he had not had enough time to form a competitive side, Coelho joined another one in 2008, Tunisia, after a brief return to club action in Saudi Arabia. On 18 November 2009, he was fired following a 0‚Äì1 loss in Mozambique for the 2010 World Cup qualification, which ended the country's streak of three consecutive presences in the tournament. Subsequently, Coelho acted as a director in the Portuguese Football Federation. Personal life Coelho met his future wife, Laurence, shortly after having moved to Paris in 1975. She worked as a freelance reporter for RTL, and the couple eventually fathered two daughters, born in 1980 and 1986.

The Newport Southbank Bridge, popularly known as the Purple People Bridge, stretches 2,670 feet over the Ohio River, connecting Newport, Kentucky to downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. History The original bridge first opened on April 1, 1872, under the name Newport and Cincinnati Bridge, and was Cincinnati's first railroad bridge spanning the Ohio River. The bridge piers were built with stone from Adams County, Ohio. The present bridge, which was built on the original piers (which were widened during that work), opened in 1897 to streetcar, pedestrian and automobile traffic. In 1904, the bridge was renamed the L&N; (Louisville and Nashville) Railroad Bridge, and this name remained until the bridge was rehabilitated and re-opened as a pedestrian-only bridge in May 2003. The bridge was closed to railroad traffic in 1987, and later closed to automobile traffic in October 2001 after years of neglect and deterioration. On April 17, 2001, the L&N; Railroad Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In late 2001, the city of Newport, Kentucky, and Southbank Partners, an economic development group, used $4 million in state funds to restore the bridge. When it was time to decide on what color to paint it, a variety of options were explored. Computer-generated images of the bridge were shown to participants in more than a dozen focus groups, all of whom picked the color purple as a top choice. It was soon coined the \\"Purple People Bridge\\" by area residents. The bridge provides convenient access to the \\"Newport on the Levee\\" development in Newport, Kentucky, as well as Downtown Cincinnati. In 2006, it became possible for the public to cross the bridge via its superstructure wearing appropriate safety gear. There are similar bridge climb experiences in Australia and New Zealand. Citing lack of funds and low attendance, the Purple People Bridge Climb closed on May 23, 2007. The bridge remains open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

Mission  The primary mission of UWE-1 was to conduct telecommunication experiments. Among other things, it was about the data transmission on the Internet under space conditions: It was necessary to adapt the common Internet protocols to the difficult conditions in space environment on Earth, the transport of data on the Web works very reliable, but in space can increasingly delays and disruptions occur. Furthermore, UWE-1 also served as a test laboratory for highly efficient solar cells, whose performance and durability should be investigated. Downlink/uplink frequency was 437.505 MHz, modulation was 9600 Baud AFSK. The amateur radio sign of UWE-1 was DP√òUWE. The last contact with the satellite took place on 17 November 2005. An identical UWE test model was made available to the Deutsches Museum in Munich, where it will be exhibited together with a test model of the successor UWE-2 in the space department. UWE-1 was followed by the later UWE-2 launched into space on September 23, 2009. UWE-1 still circles around the earth today but fell silent after conducting the Internet experiments in 2006.

He is best known for helping to plan the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was also the third Chief of Staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.  Early life  Minoru Genda was the second son of a farmer from Kake, Hiroshima Prefecture, north of the city of Hiroshima. Two brothers were graduates of Tokyo University, another brother graduated from Chiba Medical College, and his youngest brother entered the Army Academy. Genda graduated from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1924 and took flight training for 11 months in 1928‚Äì1929, graduating with honors to become a fighter pilot.  Early military service  Genda was assigned to the aircraft carrier in 1931. He was well known in the navy, and in 1932 Genda formed a demonstration team at Yokosuka, leading a division of biplanes around the country, conducting aerobatic demonstrations. Known as \\"Genda's Flying Circus\\", the team, consisting of Genda, Yoshita Kobayashi and Motoharu Okamura, using Nakajima A2N Type 90 fighters,Smith, Peter C., Fist from the Sky: Japan's Dive-Bomber Ace of World War II, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, 2005, , pp. 132-133. was part of a public relations campaign to promote naval aviation. He gained combat experience with the Second Combined Air Group during the Second Sino-Japanese War from the autumn of 1937, was senior flight instructor for the Yokosuka Air Group in 1938.Peattie, Sunburst, p. 205. Most naval strategists and tacticians of the time conceived of single carriers launching raids on enemy targets, or sailing with a fleet to provide air cover against enemy bombers. Genda understood the potential of massed air raids launched from multiple aircraft carriers steaming together. An air power advocate from the time he attended the Japanese Naval Academy, Genda urged Japan's pre-war military leaders to stop building battleships (which he believed would be better used as \\"piers\\" or scrap iron) and concentrate on aircraft carriers, submarines, and supporting fast cruisers and destroyers. Above all, Genda thought that modern and large naval air fleet would be necessary for survival if Japan was ever to fight a war with the United States and the United Kingdom as well as their allies. However, Genda's rank‚Äîcaptain‚Äîwas too low to be of much strategic influence.  Pearl Harbor and World War II  The Pearl Harbor attack plan was the brainchild of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Yamamoto ordered a number of officers to study Pearl Harbor and to draw up an operational plan. Admiral Takijiro Onishi gathered together all the relevant facts that could be found about the area. Once this was done, the attack plan itself was written primarily by Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka with assistance from Captain Genda and Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.Shinsato, Douglas T. and Tadanori Urabe, For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor Kamuela, Hawaii , 2011, pp.61-62. Yamamoto had become acquainted with Genda in 1933 when he served aboard the carrier . Yamamoto initially conceived of a one-way attack on Pearl Harbor from away. In his scheme, returning aircraft would ditch in the ocean off Oahu and the pilots would be picked up by destroyers and submarines. Yamamoto was focused on smashing the U.S. Pacific Fleet and sinking as many battleships as possible. Conventional American and Japanese naval doctrine, reflecting the Mahan theory, held that battleships were the instrumental tool of naval supremacy, so it was believed that the destruction of several of these ships would shift the balance of naval power in Japan's favor. In summer 1940 at the age of 36, Genda was chosen by the Japanese Naval Department to travel abroad as a military attach√© to obtain first-hand military accounts of German air offensives and British defensive measures during the Battle of Britain. His assessment of the Royal Air Force (RAF), Hawker Hurricane Mk I and Supermarine Spitfire Mk I fighters against the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E \\"Emil\\" later provided evidence that the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero Model 21 could easily outmaneuver these Western European aircraft. The carefully recorded details were secretly documented during his brief tour in London and were hand-carried by Genda during his return trip to Japan for naval department studies. His official trip was in accord with British-Japanese naval accords authorizing official military attach√© visits to the war front to observe and document military operations. Genda's Western European trip provided added stimulus for Japanese strategic naval studies and exercises to discover weaknesses and formulate tactics that were later used against the U.S. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the First Carrier Division and met with Yamamoto in early February 1941, during which time Yamamoto presented some ideas for attacking the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Genda warmed to his ideas.Roehrs, 2004, p. 46. Genda had previously considered an attack on Pearl Harbor in 1934 and had discussed the possibility then with Takijir≈ç Onishi. Genda emphasized to Yamamoto that \\"secrecy is the keynote and surprise the all-important factor.\\"Prange, 1991, p. 22. Genda felt that the task was \\"difficult, but not impossible\\"Prange, 1991, p. 20. and began working on the details of the plan. Genda favored a three wave attack using six aircraft carriers for a successful air strike.Roehrs, 2004, p. 47. Genda was responsible for much of the training, especially in the new tactics of shallow-water torpedo use, effective use of level-bombing by tactical aircraft, and coordinating several aircraft carriers simultaneously. He played a key role in persuading IJN leaders to name Mitsuo Fuchida, his classmate at the Japanese Naval Academy, as the leader of the air attack.Shinsato, Douglas T. and Tadanori Urabe, For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, pp.61-62, experience, inc., Kamuela, Hawaii, 2011 As a staff officer of the 1st Air Fleet from April 1941, Genda assisted Admiral Nagumo on board the , until she was eventually sunk at the battle of Midway The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in the US declaring war on Japan, with 18 American warships sunk or damaged and over 180 American aircraft destroyed. The main Japanese fleet suffered no ship losses and 29 aircraft lost (9 in the first wave and 20 in the second), losses that the Japanese considered acceptable. But this surprise attack eventually led to disaster for Japan. In the four months after the attack, the Imperial Japanese carrier units ranged across the Pacific and Indian oceans causing major damage to Allied forces and bases. Genda and Yamamoto were very disappointed that the three U.S. carriers were not at Pearl Harbor (the first time on a Sunday in 1941 that they were not). Later, the Doolittle Raid brought this phase of the Pacific War to an end, as Japan was bombed for first time. The Pacific War continued on for three more years. Genda served with distinction during World War II and personally participated in combat. He was a noted naval aviator and fighter pilot with over 3,000 flight hours. He organized an elite Japanese air unit (the 343rd K≈çk≈´tai) near the war's end as an alternative to the suicidal kamikaze units. Genda believed that even late in the war Japanese pilots were capable of fighting experienced American pilots on equal terms if properly trained and supplied with state-of- the-art aircraft. He personally felt that the Kawanishi N1K2-J Shiden-Kai (Allied code name, \\"George\\") was equal to the American F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair. This unit had some success against American aircraft and fought with distinction. However, he ultimately believed that Japanese defeat could be attributed to the continuous aerial defeats they suffered: \\"[‚Ä¶] our battles were being lost because of defeats at sea. Defeat in battle was caused by the fact that we were overwhelmed in the air war. We were losing the air war because we had failed to secure air superiority with our fighters. In short, we were losing the war because our fighters were being defeated.\\" Genda documented his World War II experiences in a revealing autobiography, published in Japan.  Political career  After retiring from the military in 1962, he ran for and was elected to the upper house of Japan's legislature, the House of Councillors, as a member of the Sato Faction within the Liberal Democratic Party. He was the first of several former SDF officers who entered politics under the auspices of the Sato Faction, mostly at the far right end of the Japanese political spectrum. He remained influential in politics for more than 20 years, as a leading member of the Defense Division of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council, often representing the hardline nationalist position advocating abrogation or curtailment of Article 9 of the postwar Japanese Constitution and open remilitarization of the armed forces. During a speaking engagement in the U.S. in 1969, in response to a question from the audience, he said that he thought the Japanese would have used the atomic bomb if they had had it; in the resultant uproar in Japan he was forced to resign as chief of the defense policy board of the LDP. He is particularly well known for his fierce opposition, along with 12 other far-right LDP Diet members, to Japan's ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty during the 1974‚Äì1976 session of the Diet, on the grounds that Japan might one day need to acquire its own nuclear arsenal. Genda died on 15 August 1989, exactly 44 years to the day after the Japanese surrender in World War II, and just one day short of his 85th birthday. He was married and had three children.

There are currently active Willibrord societies in the British Isles, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic and the United States. The aim is achieved through publications, meetings, special events and church services, and common projects in such fields as liturgy, youth work, charity giving, encouraging representation at synods and other events. The SSW in the British Isles currently supports the Anglican chaplaincy at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, in which Old Catholics are also involved. The name recalls St Willibrord, the English missionary who acted as \\"Apostle to the Frisians\\" and was consecrated the first Bishop of Utrecht in 695. Most national societies organize special events and services to coincide with St Willibrord's Day, 7 November.  History  The English society of St Willibrord was founded in 1908 with the aim of fostering closer relations between the Church of England and the Old Catholic churches. Its activities were at first aimed at promoting full communion between the two churches, which came about in the Bonn Agreement of 1931. In 2009, it was decided to also include the Celtic churches; the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of Ireland and the Church in Wales. It is now the Society of St Willibrord in Britain and Ireland. It has as its patrons the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Utrecht (of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands). The Bishop of Cashel and Ossory is its chairman.

She is closely connected to the goddess Ceres, with whom she is often depicted in art. Annona, often as Annona Augusti, was a creation of Imperial religious propaganda, manifested in iconography and cult practice. She is presented as a theophany of the emperor's power to care for his people through the provision of grain.J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), pp. 895, 915. Annona thus lacked narrative mythology or a tradition of devotion in the Roman Republic, but once established as part of Imperial cult, she was the recipient of dedications and votive offerings from private individuals motivated by gratitude or the seeking of favor.Fears, The Cult of Virtues, p. 936. Imperial cult In the propaganda of Claudius, the cult of Ceres Augusta made explicit the divine power that lay in the Imperial provision of the annona, the grain supply to the city.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" p. 894. Annona Augusti appears on coins late in the reign of Nero, when the Cult of Virtues came into prominence in the wake of the Pisonian conspiracy. She embodied two of the material benefits of Imperial rule, along with Securitas Augusti, \\"Augustan Security,\\" and often appeared as part of a pair with Ceres.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" p. 895. On Neronian coinage, Ceres, Annona, and Abundantia (\\"Abundance\\") were closely associated.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" p. 897. Annona also appears on coins issued under Vespasian, where along with other Virtues she represents the restoration of confidence in the principate, and on the coinage of Titus, Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Septimius Severus.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" pp. 900‚Äì904. She was a particular favorite in Trajan's propaganda, which sought to portray his reign as a renewal and a prosperous new era for humanity; hence Annona often appears with a symbolic child.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" pp. 913‚Äì915, 922. In the context of Trajanic politics, Annona represented Rome's grain independence from its traditional supplier Egypt.Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues,\\" pp. 923. Iconography Annona is typically depicted with a cornucopia (horn of plenty) in her arm, and a ship's prow in the background, alluding to the transport of grain into the harbor of Rome. On coins, she frequently stands between a modius (grain-measure) and the prow of a galley, with ears of grain in one hand and a cornucopia in the other; sometimes she holds a rudder or an anchor. Legacy The crater Annona in the southern hemisphere of the dwarf planet Ceres was named after this deity.

According to AllMusic, Tippett's career \\"..spanned jazz-rock, progressive rock, improvised and contemporary music, as well as modern jazz for more than half-a-century\\". He held \\" an unparalleled place in British contemporary music,\\" and was known for \\"his unique approach to improvisation\\". Tippett appeared and recorded in many settings, including a duet with Stan Tracey, duets with his wife Julie Tippetts (n√©e Driscoll), solo performances, and as a bandleader, and appeared on King Crimson albums. Early life Born in Southmead, Bristol, Tippett was the son of an English father who was a policeman and an Irish mother named Kitty. He wrote music dedicated to her after she died. He was the oldest of three siblings and went to Greenway Secondary Modern school in Southmead. As a child he played piano, church organ, cornet, and tenor horn. At fourteen he formed his first band, KT Trad Lads, with school friends Richard Murch, Mike Milton, Terry Pratt, and Bob Chard, and Eric Condell performing traditional jazz. He formed a modern jazz trio in Bristol and played regularly at the Dugout Club in Park Row, Bristol. Music career In 1967 Tippett moved to London to pursue a career in music, taking menial jobs while performing in jazz clubs. With a scholarship he attended the Barry Summer School Jazz Course in Wales, where he met Elton Dean, Nick Evans, and Marc Charig and with them started a band. The Keith Tippett Sextet was hired for a residency at the 100 Club in Oxford, leading to a contract with Vertigo Records, which released their first two albums, You Are There... I Am Here (1970) and Dedicated to You, but You Weren't Listening (1971). Robert Fripp hired Tippett to play piano on the King Crimson album In the Wake of Poseidon. Evans and Charig joined Tippett on the King Crimson album Lizard. Tippett performed on the single \\"Cat Food\\" and appeared with King Crimson on Top of the Pops. Tippett declined the offer to join King Crimson in order to continue to lead his own group, but he and Charig played on the band's album Islands. After leaving Vertigo, Tippett formed Centipede, a 50-piece band that included his wife Julie Driscoll as well as members of King Crimson and Soft Machine, and brought together much of a generation of young British jazz and rock musicians. As well as performing some concerts (limited economically by the size of the band), they recorded one double-album, Septober Energy, a Tippett composition, which was released on the RCA label in 1971. Despite substantial publicity, the album failed to sell in sufficient numbers to justify the expense of maintaining the project. For his next album, Blueprint (1972), he used a smaller group comprising himself and Julie Tippetts with bassist Roy Babbington and drummer Frank Perry. The band then expanded slightly to become Ovary Lodge, who recorded two albums, one for RCA (produced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson) and a second for the Ogun label. Tippett and his band also recorded in the 1970s for Giorgio Gomelsky's label, Utopia, releasing the Julie Tippetts album Sunset Glow. Tippett continued to play with various combinations of musicians through the 1970s, playing improvisational jazz and jazz-rock with such musicians as Stan Tracey, Robert Wyatt, Dudu Pukwana, Harry Miller, Elton Dean, Hugh Hopper, and Louis Moholo. From 1979, he also started to release many live albums of solo piano performances, beginning with The Unlonely Raindancer. In the late 1980s, he, along with Paul Dunmall saxes, Paul Rogers bass, and Tony Levin drums, formed the quartet Mujician, playing purely improvised jazz. Mujician released 6 albums from 1990-2002. He also formed a trio with Julie Tippetts and Willi Kellers, and wrote film and television scores. He also wrote music for string quartets and piano, and taught at summer schools. Tippett also continued to record and to tour in Britain and Europe with various ensembles. He also worked with musicians Andy Sheppard, as well as with his frequent collaborators Elton Dean, Louis Moholo, and Howard Riley. In Bristol starting in 1989 and continuing through the nineties, KT started the Seedbank Orchestra (SO), which performed at venues including the Thekla, the Arnolfini and Bristol Old Vic. This enabled beginners, amateurs and professional musicians to play in a large ensemble and was \\"emblematic of his quest to unite music of all types in a non-elitist, open to all, friendly environment free of establishment restrictions.\\" He became a \\"musician's musician when he first set up the Seedbed Orchestra where many Bristol musicians could benefit from his guidance.\\" Personal life and death He married singer Julie Driscoll in 1970. In 2018, he had a heart attack and pneumonia but returned to performing in 2019. He died on 14 June 2020 at the age of 72. Discography =As leader= * You Are Here...

First announced on June 11, 1917 it was originally a military camp named for former president Zachary Taylor. For a time it was America's largest military training camp, housing 47,500 men at one time, and spurred development in an area that was previously dominated by farmland. Most of the camp was dismantled after World War I and a residential neighborhood emerged, composed mostly of small bungalow and Cape Cod homes, many built or purchased by soldiers returning from the war. Many of these buildings were built from lumber and other materials from the dismantled military buildings. The working class community was annexed by Louisville in 1950. F. Scott Fitzgerald was stationed at Camp Taylor and mentions it in his novel The Great Gatsby. Bellarmine University is built on part of the location of the former Camp Taylor.

The estate was named to commemorate the United Kingdom's acquisition of the island of Cyprus in 1878. It was built on one of the few pieces of land not owned by the Port of London Authority, and hence was open to such development. In 1981 during the redevelopment of the London Docklands, Cyprus was the location of the first new private housing development in the Docklands for many years, and the first sponsored by the London Docklands Development Corporation.

Life Born in County Dublin, Browne entered Trinity College Dublin, in 1682, and after ten years' residence obtained a fellowship. In 1699 he was made Provost, and in the same year published his Letter in answer to a Book entitled \\"Christianity not Mysterious,\\" which was recognized as the ablest reply yet written to Toland. It expounds in germ the whole of his later theory of analogy. Browne was a man of abstemious habits, charitable disposition, and impressive eloquence. In 1710 he was made bishop of Cork and Ross, which post he held till his death in 1735. Works In 1713 Browne became known for his vigorous pamphleteering attack on the fashion of drinking healths, especially \\"to the glorious and immortal memory.\\" His two most important works are the Procedure, Extent, and Limits of the Human Understanding (1728), an able though sometimes captious critique of Locke's essay, and Things Divine and Supernatural conceived by Analogy with Things Natural and Human, more briefly referred to as the Divine Analogy (1733). The doctrine of analogy was intended as a reply to the deistical conclusions that had been drawn from Locke's theory of knowledge. Browne holds that not only God's essence, but his attributes are inexpressible by our ideas, and can only be conceived analogically. This view was vigorously assailed as leading to atheism by Berkeley in his Alciphron (Dialogue iv.), and a great part of the Divine Analogy is occupied with a defence against that criticism. The bishop emphasizes the distinction between metaphor and analogy; though the conceived attributes are not thought. as they are in themselves, yet there is a reality corresponding in some way to our ideas of them. His analogical arguments resemble those found in the Bampton Lectures of Dean Mansel.

Their duties vary according to the type of car, but most typically include managing passenger seat assignments (in order to avoid separating parties of two or more), assisting the conductor with tickets, making announcements, opening and closing doors, assisting passengers with boarding and detraining, monitoring the safe operation of onboard systems, and generally ensuring the safe operation of the car. In addition, sleeping car attendants (formerly called \\"Pullman porters\\") typically convert the individual accommodations from \\"day\\" mode to \\"night\\" mode, rather than leaving that to the passengers, and set out coffee and juice for their passengers each morning. (Sleeping car attendants, however, typically have fewer passengers to serve than coach attendants). Lounge car attendants typically operate food and beverage service, sell souvenirs and other non-food items, operate onboard motion picture service, and keep tables clean.

It operates as a Christian ministry, and calls for \\"equipping and empowering Christians to restore America‚Äôs biblical foundation.\\" The organization promotes Christian Reconstructionism and Postmillennialism, and opposes dispensationalism. Gary DeMar was the organization's president from 1986 to 2015. From 2015 to March of 2019 Joel McDurmon was president, during which time Demar was Senior Fellow. Gary Demar returned as president in March of 2019 when McDurmon resigned. Activities American Vision publishes books \\"primarily for use in Christian schools and for home schoolers.\\" The group is active in the creation science movement. American Vision trains parents, teachers, pastors and activists \\"in developing family-oriented biblical worldviews.\\" It hosts an annual \\"Worldview Conference\\", which has featured speakers such as Herbert Titus. Beliefs American Vision is opposed to abortion. The group maintains that the First Amendment's demand that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\" means that Congress may not establish a state religion. The group maintains that the First Amendment does not prohibit members of Congress from making laws that are in submission to the Bible. DeMar has said that not all homosexuals would be executed under a \\"reconstructed government\\" but that he did believe that the occasional execution of \\"sodomites\\" would serve society well because \\"the law that requires the death penalty for homosexual acts effectively drives the perversion of homosexuality underground, back into the closet\\" DeMar also wrote a \\"long-term goal\\" should be \\"the execution of abortionists and parents who hire them\\". Islam is another enemy; in August 2010 he said that \\"the long-term goal of Islam is the abolition of our constitutional freedoms.\\" In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center designated American Vision as an anti-gay hate group because of its purported support of the \\"death penalty for practicing homosexuals.\\" However, in 2016, American Vision, under Joel McDurmon's leadership, moved away from this position, stating that \\"Biblical law has transferred First Table punishments from earthly civil governments to the throne of heaven\\", and that right now only the moral principles are still binding.

If other brothers of Temujin, Hasar and Temuge, are frequently mentioned in the Secret History as devoted companions and supporters of the elder brother, the mentions of Hachiun are rare, not only in the accounts of political and public affairs, but also in regular dialogues of daily life. Therefore, there is an opinion that Hachiun might have died early as the chronicles describing the later affairs of Genghis Khan do not mention Hachiun. But he was still alive in 1207: when already a full-fledged ruler of the whole of Mongolia, Genghis Khan was arranging his state affairs, Hachiun received land possessions and subjects from his mighty elder brother the seventh in the hierarchy after their mother Hoelun and younger brother Temuge (as one household), 4 sons of Temujin and brother Hasar, in that order. Hachiun was said to have very good relationship with his brother Hasar but a poorer one with Tem√ºge. This might be due to preferential treatment of his younger brother in the form of land and power.

Software industry and computer books In 1985, M√ºller started writing articles for German computer magazines.. A year later, at age 16, he became Germany's youngest computer book author.. From 1987 to 1998, he specialized on publishing and distribution cooperations between US and European software companies. He initiated and managed such alliances in various market segments, including productivity software, utility software, educational software, and computer games. As a consultant to and representative of Blizzard Entertainment, M√ºller was involved in their marketing campaigns.

Following several years of intensive lobbying by many parties, this proposed directive was rejected by the European Parliament on July 6, 2005, with 648 out of 680 votes cast. on European Parliament's rejection of proposed CII directive. For his political activities, M√ºller received several awards in 2005.

Google= In January 2011 M√ºller published an article suggesting that \\"evidence is mounting that different components of the Android mobile operating system may indeed violate copyrights of Sun Microsystems, a company Oracle acquired a year ago.\\" and presented what he believed was copyright infringing material, an article which was heavily criticized by two technical bloggers. According to Ed Burnette, a ZDNet blogger, Google published those files on its web site to help developers debug and test their own code. ArsTechnica's Ryan Paul also said that these findings in the online codebase are also not evidence that copyright infringing code is distributed on Android handsets. Two days after his original assertions M√ºller claimed to have found the files in the official source availability packages of device makers Motorola, LG and Samsung. The lawsuit ended with both parties agreeing to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code, so that Oracle could appeal. In April 2012, M√ºller said he had been hired by Oracle to consult on competition-related topics including FRAND licensing terms. In a court filing in the Oracle v.

The airport serves the towns of Harstad and Narvik. It is co-located with Evenes Air Station of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The civilian sector is owned and operated by the state- owned Avinor and handled 654,977 passengers in 2013. Evenes has a runway, a parallel taxiway and a terminal with five gates. The airlines with daily scheduled services are Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Wider√∏e. Destinations with daily services are Oslo, Trondheim, Bod√∏, Troms√∏ and Andenes. Evenes is the only primary airport in Central H√•logaland and its catchment area for Oslo-bound flights includes Lofoten and Vester√•len. Seaplane services to Harstad and Narvik started in 1935. Planning of an airport started in the 1950s. Several locations were considered, including building separate airports for each town. Consensus for Evenes was reached in the mid-1960s, but construction was postponed to prioritize local airports, which resulted in Narvik also receiving Narvik Airport, Framnes. Evenes opened on 30 June 1973, initially with a runway. It was extended in 1977, after the military decided to establish the air station. SAS Commuter served Harstad- Narvik from 1990 to 2002, and from 1994 competition was introduced on the Oslo route with the entry of Braathens SAFE. Norwegian started services in 2003 and launched international scheduled services from 2013. History =Seaplanes= The first scheduled airline service to Harstad and Narvik was carried out by Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) in 1935. Using a Junkers W 34, they flew a coastal route between Bergen and Troms√∏, with stops in Narvik and Harstad. The route continued until 1939 when it was terminated because of the outbreak of World War II. The route resumed in 1946, when it was flown with a Junkers Ju 52. DNL also operated a direct service between Harstad and Narvik. Harstad's water aerodrome was located at Klubbeskj√¶ret in the town center. For a while there were discussion of moving it to Harstadbotn, but this was not carried out. Seaplane routes were only conducted during the summer.Steinnes: 477 Wider√∏e started flying to Narvik in 1951, at first flying via Svolv√¶r to Bod√∏. DNL's successor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) terminated its seaplane routes the following year, leaving them to Wider√∏e, who operated the Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada Otter. Patronage at Harstad was 1,143 passengers in 1946, 2,725 the following year and 8,037 in 1959. The latter year saw 6,139 passengers at Narvik. The Harstad‚ÄìNarvik area had been proposed as a potential location of Bardufoss Air Station when it had been planned during the late 1930s. However, Bardufoss has been selected because of its favorable strategic location. About 1950 discussions started regarding construction of an airport between Bod√∏ and Troms√∏.Svendsen: 393 A survey conducted in 1951 looked into the possibilities of building an airport for Harstad at Sk√•nland, R√∏dmyra, Tennvass√•sen and Kj√∏tta. In Narvik work started on planning an airport in Evenes, which was approved by Narvik Municipal Council in February 1951. However, it also considered several closer locations, such as Herjangfjellet, Elvg√•rdsmoen, H√•kvikvleira and Vidrek. The civilian sector at Bardufoss Airport opened in 1956. It served all of Troms√∏ as well as Ofoten. Travel time to Bardufoss was three hours from Narvik and six hours from Harstad. Aerial view of the airport =Establishment= Two engineering students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology concluded in 1957 that a new airport in Harstad would cost 3 million Norwegian krone (NOK).Steinnes: 478 This was followed up with a meeting between representatives from Harstad and Narvik. Harstad and the surrounding municipalities proposed in 1960 an airport at Evenskjer in Evenes, on condition that the Tjeldsund Bridge be built, allowing the island of Hinn√∏ya to be connected to the mainland. For Narvik a similar consideration was the necessary construction of the Rombak Bridge.Steinnes: 479 The municipalities of Harstad, Ibestad, Kv√¶fjord and Sk√•nland created the Southern Troms Intermunicipal Airport Committee in 1963. It concluded that the airport for the Harstad area and Vester√•len should be built at Kv√¶fjordeidet, while Narvik would be best served with a motorway to Bardufoss. Narvik Municipality conducted surveys at Herjangsfjellet in 1962 and 1963.Svendsen: 394 A government committee which had received a mandate to consider future airports, concluded with a report on 16 December 1964. It recommended that nine more primary airports be built and that Evenes and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget receive top priority. The committee noted SAS' introduction of the Sud Aviation Caravelle and wanted to build a network of airport capable of handling jetliners. It argued for Evenes as a good location that despite it being slightly closer to Harstad, Narvik would be closer to Bardufoss and have an advantage of it as a reserve airport. At a common meeting for eleven southern Troms and Ofoten municipalities on 11 May 1965, these unanimously supported Evenes. They establish a committee, which issued a report to the government in June 1966, which concluded that it would be possible to have an airport completed by 1968.Svendsen: 395 Departure hall of the airport The airlines Braathens SAFE and Wider√∏e both launched an alternative proposal whereby the government instead should build a network of short take-off and landing airports. When H√•kon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965, he placed the primary airport construction plan on hold and instead focused on construction of regional airports. This caused local interest for airports at Kv√¶fjordeidet and Vidrek to resume, after initiative from Wider√∏e. Several commercial interest organizations in Narvik supported an airport at Vidrek, while their Harstad counterparts supported an airport at Evenes. Narvik Municipal Council continued to support Evenes until it was instead proposed as a regional airport. It voted in February 1968 to continue to support Evenes as a primary airport, but also work for a local airport in Narvik.Svendsen: 396 The Tjelsund Bridge was opened on 22 October 1967.Steinnes: 473 The construction of an airport for Harstad and Narvik was discussed in Parliament in June 1970. First a large majority voted down a proposal to build regional airport for each town, followed by a unanimous decision to build a primary airport at Evenes. Construction started in the fall of 1971 and the airport opened 30 June 1973, with a runway. SAS was granted the right to fly to Oslo, while Braathens SAFE was allowed to fly a route via Kristiansund, Molde and √Ölesund to Bergen and Stavanger, as well as to Bod√∏ and Troms√∏.Svanberg: 669 Narvik Airport, Framnes opened on 1 October 1975, and Wider√∏e started operating from Narvik to Evenes.Svendsen: 397 Norving started a route from Harstad/Narvik to Lule√•, Sweden and Rovaniemi, Finland, in 1984, using the Dornier Do 228. This required the establishment of a border control at Evenes, which Norving had to pay for.Melling: 208 Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800 at the airport The air force started looking at Evenes as a potential air station after the airport opened. Military funding was allocated, allowing the runway to be extended to plus overrun and a taxiway, as well as parking for fighter aircraft, heavy transport aircraft and maintenance facilities.Arheim: 223 The extended runway was completed in 1977.Svanberg: 679 Construction of the initial auxiliary facilities started in 1978 and was concluded in 1985. Evenes Air Station became operative in January 1986. Construction continued with barracks, which were completed in 1991, aircraft shelters, administrative offices and storage facilities, which were concluded in 1995. No military aircraft have been permanently stationed at Evenes.Arheim: 224 =Operational history= Nordtrafikk started an airport coach service from Sortland in 1990. Estimates showed that it captured 4,300 annual passengers which otherwise would have used Stokmarknes Airport, Skagen. SAS reorganized its operations in Northern Norway from 1990 and Harstad/Narvik became one of four airports to receive direct services to Oslo. Previously these sometimes made intermediate stops at Trondheim. Services to Bod√∏, Troms√∏ and Trondheim were transferred to the newly established SAS Commuter. The airline market in Norway was deregulated on 1 April 1994. The same day Braathens SAFE started two daily services from Evenes to Oslo.Tjomsland and Wilsberg: 340‚Äì341 However, the airline terminated its direct service to Bergen, instead making passengers transfer at Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes. At the same time Wider√∏e's route Andenes‚ÄìHarstad/Narvik‚ÄìNarvik‚ÄìBod√∏ terminated its stops at Harstad/Narvik. Kato Air was established in 1995 with Evenes as its base, initially offering general aviation services. Weekly flights with fresh fish to Japan started in the mid-1990s. Kato Air started flights from Harstad/Narvik to Bod√∏ and Troms√∏ on 1 January 1999, but the route failed to attract sufficient patronage and was terminated before the end of the year. After the 2001 purchase of Braathens by SAS Group, the latter terminated its flights to Harstad/Narvik from 2 April 2002. Flights to Oslo were taken over by Braathens, while SAS Commuter's flights to Troms√∏, Bod√∏ and Trondheim were taken over by Wider√∏e. Norwegian Air Shuttle started flights to Harstad/Narvik from Oslo on 5 May 2003. SAS and Braathens merged in 2004, creating SAS Braathens. The Lofoten Fixed Link opened on 1 December 2007, abolishing the need for a ferry between the airport and Lofoten. The driving distance to Svolv√¶r‚Äîtypically regarded as the starting point for the Lofoten archipelago‚Äîwas reduced to and two and a half hours. Subsequently, the airport started marketing itself internationally as Lofoten International Airport. The initiative was welcomed by the tourist industry in Lofoten and Vester√•len, as Evenes is the only primary airport serving the area. Local politicians in Lofoten opposed the name, stating that it threatened the regional Leknes Airport and Svolv√¶r Airport, Helle. Royal Norwegian Air Force Lockheed C-130 Hercules at Evenes Kato Air terminated operations in 2008, following the grounding of its aircraft after the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway closed its maintenance division. Parliament decided in June 2012 to order the new Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters, with delivery scheduled to start in 2016. The aircraft will be stationed at √òrland Main Air Station with a forward base (QRA) to be established at Evenes Air Station. Wider√∏e started a service to Troms√∏ from 1 April 2012, after it was included in the public service obligation system. Evenes saw a large increase of charter services from late 2012, primarily targeted at bringing English and German tourists to Lofoten from London and Munich. Norwegian introduced scheduled services to Gran Canaria and Alicante in Spain from 2013, as well as to Trondheim. Privatefly placed Evenes ninth in a worldwide contest of the most spectacular approach in 2012. Facilities The terminal has a capacity for 1,200 passengers per hour and has five gates. Evenes is rated as an airport of entry and some of the gates can be used for international flights. The control tower is located in the former terminal building. There are hangars for smaller airlines. The terminal has a duty-free store and two automated teller machines. The asphalt runway measures and is aligned 17‚Äì35, roughly north‚Äìsouth. There is a parallel taxiway. Runway 17 has precision approach. Both runways have instrument landing system Category I. The airport is located at an elevation of 26 meters (85 ft) above mean sea level. There are minor operative limitations because of the surrounding terrain. The apron has parking for seven category Boeing 737 and similar sized aircraft, and one larger wide-body aircraft. In addition there is space for general aviation aircraft and helicopters. The airport is certified to handle aircraft up to the size of the Boeing 747 and the C-5 Galaxy. Along with Lakselv Airport, Banak, Evenes is selected by international airlines as an emergency airport for intercontinental flights which pass over Northern Norway. In an emergency the airport is permitted to handle an Airbus A380 and an Antonov An-124 Ruslan. Airlines and destinations Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800 taking off Regular domestic scheduled services are provided by Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Wider√∏e. Norwegian and SAS offer five and three daily services using Boeing 737 aircraft to Oslo. Norwegian also operates less frequent services to Trondheim, Bergen and Sandefjord. Wider√∏e operates a daily service to Andenes and Trondheim, and two daily services to Bod√∏ and Troms√∏, the latter a public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Norwegian and Condor provide international services to Spain and Germany, while several airlines operate charter services to the Mediterranean. The airport served 692,532 passengers and 10,636 aircraft movements and handled 1,009 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Evenes is the only primary airport located in Central H√•logaland and the only to offer direct flights to Oslo. There are seven regional airports in the region, but these are limited to other destinations in Northern Norway and require change of aircraft at Bod√∏ Airport to reach Oslo. There is a significant leakage to Evenes from Lofoten and Vester√•len to Harstad/Narvik for flights to Oslo. These are estimated at forty-five percent for Vester√•len and twenty percent for Lofoten. Ground transport Map showing the airports in the region of H√•logaland of northern Norway. A new primary airport for the Lofoten region is planned outside Hadselsand (orange). This airport would replace the smaller nearby airports of Stokmarknes, Svolv√¶r and Leknes. Evenes is located by road (40 minutes) from Harstad, (50 minutes) from Narvik, (1:40 hours) from Sortland, (2:05 hours) from Stokmarknes, from Svolv√¶r and to Leknes. There are direct airport coaches to Harstad, Narvik and Sortland; other parts of Vester√•len and Lofoten are served with scheduled buses operated by Boreal Transport. The airport has 1,000 paid parking spaces; car rental and taxis are also available. Future The air force has started upgrading Evenes Air Station to be used first for the F-16 Fighting Falcon from 2016 and the F-35 from 2019. The air station will have a capacity for stationing a QRA of 15 fighter aircraft, as well as handling exercises with allied aircraft. The air station is estimated to produce 1,600 aircraft movements per year once operative. The government has also proposed that new Maritime Patrol Aircraft shall be co-located with F-35 at Evenes Air Station. Evenes will also be strengthened with the establishment of dedicated base defence units and long-range air defences. And√∏ya air station that currently serves as base for Norway's Maritime Patrol Aircraft, is slated for closure. Avinor plans to expand the runway safety area in 2014. Narvik Airport, Framnes closed in 2017, based on the opening of the H√•logaland Bridge. The bridge will reduce the travel distance by road from Narvik to the Evenes by and 20 minutes. Avinor is planning to build a new primary airport to serve Lofoten and possibly also Vester√•len. Two locations have been put forward, Gims√∏ya () and Hadselsand (). Gims√∏y has after a thorough investigation been deemed unsuitable as the site for a new airport due to high wind turbulence. Hadselsand would have direct services to Oslo, resulting in reduction of leakage to Evenes. Independent of the airport plans, there are plans to build a tunnel between Fiskefjorden and Gullesfjorden which would reduce the road distance from Lofoten to Evenes by and 31 minutes.E10/rv. 85 Evenes- Sortland (KVU) References =Bibliography=   External links * * Harstad/Narvik Airport, Avinor Category:Airports in Nordland Category:Airports in the Arctic Category:Avinor airports Category:Evenes Category:1973 establishments in Norway Category:Airports established in 1973 ","title":"Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes"},{"id":"3029770","text":"Peterson Island is an Antarctic rocky island, long, with two inlets indenting the north side, lying immediately west of Browning Peninsula in the south part of the Windmill Islands.

Her research focuses on the origins of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, studied using mice as model organisms. Previously she had been a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is notable for her role in what became known as the \\"Baltimore affair\\", in which a 1986 paper she co-authored with David Baltimore was the subject of research misconduct allegations. Following a series of investigations, she was fully exonerated of the charges in 1996. Early life and education A native of Brazil, Thereza Imanishi-Kari earned a BS degree in biology from the University of Sao Paulo near her home town of Indaiatuba, Brazil. Subsequently she studied at Kyoto University, in Kyoto, Japan, and the University of Helsinki in Finland, which awarded her a PhD in the field of immunogenetics. Research Imanishi-Kari's research focuses on immunology, particularly on understanding the molecular and cell biology underlying the development of autoimmune disease. She studies systemic lupus erythematosus using mouse models and has been funded for this work by the Lupus Research Institute and the National Institutes of Health. Her interest in immunology was motivated in part by her sister's death due to lupus. Investigation and exoneration In 1986, Imanishi-Kari co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with David Baltimore. The paper, published in the scientific journal Cell, showed unexpected results on how the immune system rearranges its genes to produce antibodies against antigens it encounters for the first time. Margot O'Toole, a researcher in Imanishi-Kari's lab, claimed she could not reproduce some of the experiments in the paper and accused Imanishi-Kari of fabricating the data. Since the research had been funded by the U.S. federal government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the matter was taken up by the United States Congress, where it was aggressively pursued by, among others, Representative John Dingell. Largely on the basis of these findings, NIH's fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity, accused Dr. Imanishi-Kari in 1991 of falsifying data and recommended she be barred from receiving research grants for 10 years. In 1996, a newly constituted U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appeals panel reviewed the case again and dismissed all charges against Imanishi-Kari. In August 1996 she gained an official position as an assistant professor in the pathology department of the Tufts University School of Medicine. There was widespread criticism of the government's system for dealing with allegations of misconduct, and calls for review of the oversight procedures dealing with the integrity of biomedical research. The case of alleged scientific misconduct and her exoneration was reported in Scientific American. A New York Times editorial at the time described the final result of the ten-year investigation as \\"embarrassment for the Federal Government and belated vindication for the accused scientist\\". The high profile of the case resulted in a great deal of published commentary on the matter. The mathematician Serge Lang discussed the case in an article published in the journal Ethics and Behavior in January 1993. Several books, including The Baltimore Case (1998) by Daniel Kevles of Yale University and The Great Betrayal: Fraud in Science by science historian Horace Freeland Judson, also covered the Baltimore affair.

The story is about an unusual vampire girl, who instead of drinking blood must inject it into others because she produces too much. Chibi Vampire first premiered in the sh≈çnen magazine Monthly Dragon Age in the October 2003 issue, and ran until February 2008. The individual chapters were published by Kadokawa Shoten into fourteen collected volumes. Later an anime series for \\"Chibi Vampire\\" was also produced in 2005. This anime series has a somewhat similar but different story and ending. In 2003, Tohru Kai began writing a series of light novels based on the manga, with Kagesaki providing the illustrations. The nine-volume series was published in Japan by Fujimi Shobo. Both the manga and light novel series were licensed for English language release by Tokyopop. Tokyopop renamed the manga series to Chibi Vampire and the novel series to Chibi Vampire: The Novel. In 2005, an anime television series adaptation was animated by J.C.Staff and directed by Shinichiro Kimura. Spanning twenty-four episodes, the series aired in Japan on WOWOW from November 4, 2005 through May 12, 2006. It was licensed for an English release to Region 1 DVD, under the original name Karin, by Geneon USA. On July 3, 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced that Funimation had agreed to be the exclusive North American distributor of Geneon titles, including Karin. Plot Karin Maaka is the middle child in a family of vampires who immigrated to Japan two centuries earlier. Unlike the rest of her family, Karin does not feed on blood, she produces it. As a result, she is forced to bite others to expel the extra blood, lest she suffer exaggerated nose-bleeds. She also exhibits no normal vampire traits, and instead lives her life just as an ordinary teenage girl would. She can go outside during the day, attends high school, and follows the sleep pattern of normal humans. However, the general peacefulness of her life is disrupted with the arrival of a new transfer student, Kenta Usui. Any time she goes near him her blood increases. At first she tries to avoid him but they are in the same class and work in the same restaurant. Kenta begins to think that there is something fishy about Karin and eventually he learns her secret. Karin's elder brother Ren tries to erase his memory but Anju, Karin's younger sister, stops him from doing so. She convinces their parents Henry and Calera to make Kenta their ally, because he can help Karin during the daylight. Karin and Kenta become friends, and as they spend more time with one another, fall in love, though they are slow to admit their feelings to one another. Yuriya Tachibana, a human-vampire hybrid, moves to the area at the request of her vampire uncle, Glark. By chance, Yuriya gets a job at the same restaurant where Karin and Kenta work. As hybrids are sterile, Tachibana disapproves of Karin and Kenta's relationship, feeling any children they had would be unhappy like her. Despite this, Karin likes Tachibana and considers her a friend. On the other hand, Karin's grandmother Elda hates hybrids, as a betrayal danger to vampires. Karin rescues Yuriya from her grandmother. Karin is unaware that Tachibana is actually there to help her uncle and the Brownlick clan spy on her. After another nose bleed leaves Karin comatose for several days, Karin's family ask Kenta to stay away from her, but the two lovers are unable to stand being apart and eventually reunite and become a couple. Shortly after they share their first kiss, Tachibana helps Glark and Bridget Brownlick kidnap Karin and take her the Brownlick estate. It is revealed that Karin is a \\"psyche\\", a blood-giving vampire that can give life to other vampires and heals the sterility currently plaguing all vampires. In doing so, however, vampires have historically been greedy and drain the psyche dry, killing her as a sacrifice. The first psyche, Sophia, reveals herself to Kenta but cannot be seen by anyone else while helping Kenta find Karin. Karin's father Henry, her brother Ren, and Kenta go to rescue Karin. Meanwhile, Tachibana is horrified to learn that not only will Karin be killed, but also raped until she has a child to produce a new psyche to replace her. She apologizes to Karin for disapproving of Kenta's relationship and for hurting Karin, and helps her escape just as Kenta comes in with Ren. While Ren takes care of the vampire, Bridget, holding Karin captive, Henry battles Glark and the Brownlicks, joined belatedly by his mother Elda. Kenta, Karin, and Tachibana escape, but Tachibana leaves them to go ensure her uncle won't be caught in the sun. It is later revealed that Karin shared consciousness with Sophia, who gave Karin her condition and helped Kenta rescue Karin. Karin stopped producing excess blood (and being a vampire altogether) after Sophia moved from Karin to Kenta during her last bite. Karin's family sorrowfully erases all of her memories of them, so that she can live as a normal human with Kenta, while they quietly watch over her. They had prepared to do so for over four years, and the process is successful; they cannot erase Kenta's memories however without him reverting to a 4-year old such that he is left having to keep the secret from Karin, who he marries shortly after. At the end of the series, Karin and Kenta have a daughter named Kanon, who is the reborn Sophia; Karin's sister Anju continues to watch over her sister's happiness. Media =Manga= Written by Yuna Kagesaki, Chibi Vampire premiered in Japan in the October 2003 issue of Monthly Dragon Age and ran until the February 2008 issue. It was also published in fourteen collected volumes by Kadokawa Shoten, released between October 1, 2003 and April 1, 2008 in Japan. A one-shot side story created by Kagesaki, , was included in the June 2008 issue of Monthly Dragon Age. It concerns Karin's cousin Friedrich Marker, and concludes with a family tree of the Marker/Maaka family. A second side story is Maki-chan, Helping Angel of Love, concerned with Karin's friend Maki Tokitou. It ends with an epilog, of Maki walking out on her husband for the umpteenth time and coming to Karin's house to help celebrate Karin's birthday. Both side stories were collected into a volume titled Chibi Vampire: Airmail. In 2005, Tokyopop acquired the license to release both the manga and light novel series in English in North America. To avoid confusion with another of its properties, Tokyopop chose to release the manga under the name Chibi Vampire instead of under its original name of Karin. Tokyopop released the first translated manga volume on April 11, 2006 and the last one on September 29, 2009. They also released the novel series with the manga. Tokyopop also released a collection of Karin short stories under the title: \\"Chibi Vampire: Airmail\\" on August 31, 2010. Viz Media later acquired the rights to the series and released a complete digital publication for Kindle. The series has also been released internationally by Pika √âdition in France, and by Waneko in Poland. =Light novels= A series of light novels, , were written by Tohru Kai with illustrations provided by Kagesaki. The novels were published by Fujimi Shobo, with the first volume released on December 10, 2003. As of April 2008, nine volumes have been released. Tokyopop, which also licensed the manga series, acquired the license to release the novels in English in North America. As the company had renamed the manga series from Karin to Chibi Vampire, it released the novel series under the name Chibi Vampire: The Novel. The first English volume was released on January 9, 2007. In June 2008, Tokyopop restructured itself, breaking into two subsidiaries under a single holding company, and cut its publication releases by more than half. As part of this cut back, Tokyopop canceled the remaining releases of Chibi Vampire: The Novel after the fifth volume, due to be released July 8, 2008. The company later reversed the cancellation and announced that volume six would be released April 13, 2010. In the end volume 8 was published by Tokyopop on March 1, 2011, but volume 9 was not. Chibi Vampire: The Novel is closely tied to the manga series, with each novel volume designed to be read after its corresponding manga volume. For example, the first novel takes place between the events that occur in the first and second volumes of the manga series, and the fourth volume of the manga mentions characters and events from the first novel volume. =Anime= In 2005, an anime television series adaptation was animated by J.C.Staff, directed by Shinichiro Kimura, and written by Yasunori Yamada. Spanning twenty-four episodes, the series aired in Japan on WOWOW from November 4, 2005 through May 12, 2006. It was licensed for an English release to Region 1 DVD, under the original name Karin, by Geneon USA; however, the company went out of business before completing the release of the series. On July 3, 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon Entertainment will still retain the license, Funimation Entertainment will assume exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. Karin was one of several titles involved in the deal. While Funimation is distributing the DVDs, Geneon is the licensor of the series, and also produced the English dub in association with Odex. =Other= A book entitled () was published by Kadokawa Shoten on March 17, 2006 as a guidebook to give an overview of the Chibi Vampire series. The first portion of the book contains illustrations by Yuna Kagesaki; the second part contains an overview of the series' setting, including a map of the town featured in Chibi Vampire; the third part has the results of a reader questionnaire; the fourth part has descriptions of the characters, and outlines of some of the popular scenes throughout the series. This book was published by TokyoPop as Chibi Vampire: Bites on December 28, 2010. Reception The English language light novel, and manga adaptations have received generally favorable reviews by various notable critics. Theron Martin from Anime News Network gave the first two manga volumes an overall B+ grade. Martin said that there is a good twist in play on a genre badly in need of one, he also added that the artwork was good, but it was also generic as well as sometimes \\"cartoonish\\". Martin also did reviews for the fifth, sixth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth volume. Martin referred to Elda as a \\"juicy\\" new character in the fifth volume, but said that some of the plot was too generic. He praised the sixth volume for having much drama and important plot info. but was unimpressed by the \\"true humor\\", and un- translated sound effects. Martin gave both volumes an overall B rating. In the tenth volume which was also given a B rating, Martin again praised the plot developments but said that the addition of the half-vampire character was \\"not particularly interesting\\". Martin gave the twelfth, and thirteenth volumes an overall grade of a B+ saying that there is more \\"intricate writing\\" than meets the eye. His criticism about these two volumes were that some of the content is too clich√©d. The final volume received a B+ rating from Martin who gave a plus to almost all of the plot resolutions that didn't involve Maki. He said that reasons behind Sophia's existence were an issue though along with action scenes that were hard to follow. Chris Johnston from Newtype USA gave the first manga volume a positive review calling it a \\"charmingly macabre manga \\". Johnston stated that the addition of the vampire plot accentuates the humor, and gives the story more of a purpose than just puppy love. Chris Beveridge from Mania also gave the fourteenth volume a review. Beveridge gave the volume a B rating saying he was glad the series ended on a good note before becoming too uninteresting. he also said that the artwork was spot on, and the franchise as a whole is \\"good fun\\". In 2007, the Chibi Vampire light novel series was a runner up for the Kadokawa Shoten's first annual Light Novel Award in the \\"Novelization\\" category.

He usually collaborates with his wife, Randy Lofficier (born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 3, 1953), and the reason why credits sometimes read \\"R.J.M. Lofficier\\", after the initials of both spouses. Biography Jean-Marc Lofficier was born in Toulon, France in 1954. The son of a serviceman, he moved several times during his formative years, spending \\"a goodly part of my childhood in Bordeaux, and my teenage years in Fontainebleau.\\"Christian Cawley, \\"Jean-Marc Lofficier Interview\\" for Kasterborous, March 13, 2005. Retrieved December 29, 2008 A budding writer from an early age, Lofficier also \\"drew my own little comic strips when I was 13, 14, and began being published in French 'zines at 16.\\" Recalling in 2005 that \\"writing wasn't deemed a respectable, economically sound way of making a living,\\" he got an MBA and a Law degree, then went to work in international banking. Graduating from the Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University and from ESCP Europe business school in 1978, Jean-Marc Lofficier worked for Barclays Bank in Paris for a year before being hired by Credit Lyonnais and moving to Los Angeles, California, where he met Randy. Jean-Marc and Randy were married the following year. Jean-Marc recalled in 2005 that their writing partnership developed alongside their personal relationship; \\"Randy always wanted to write... [so] it evolved organically in a mutually complementary working relationship.\\". Jean-Marc left Credit Lyonnais in 1985 to join Starwatcher Graphics, a new company set up by French artist Moebius and his wife Claudine, then living in Santa Monica. After Moebius returned to France, and Starwatcher Graphics was disbanded in 2000, the Lofficiers started their own company, Hollywood Comics, which advises and counsels comic book professionals in their dealings with Hollywood. Jean-Marc and Randy moved to Chalabre, in the South of France, in 2005. =Magazines and Hollywood= In 1979, the Lofficiers built on Jean-Marc's earlier work for fanzines and French magazines ‚Äì including Lunatique and L'Ecran Fantastique, for which he wrote a combination of articles, reviews and short stories ‚Äì and began working as \\"film journalists\\" for a variety of \\"cinema/sf pro magazines.\\" Covering the Hollywood-based film industry (and particularly those aspects with a Sci-Fi or Fantasy bent), the Lofficiers wrote for a number of magazines created both for American and overseas audiences. Their work appeared in such mainstream U.S. publications as Starlog, Cinefex, Heavy Metal and American Cinematographer, as well as more focused publications including T. E. D. Klein's The Twilight Zone Magazine. Overseas, the Lofficiers' work appeared in United Kingdom magazines including Dez Skinn's Starburst (the magazine of \\"Science Fantasy in Television, Cinema and Comix\\") and House of Hammer, while in France, they continued to contribute to L'Ecran Fantastique. =Guides, books and novels= The Lofficiers' magazine work, which included short stories, retrospectives and TV program guides alongside journalistic articles, led naturally to them co-authoring a number of non-fiction books about film and television programs. Their first ‚Äì The Doctor Who Programme Guide, published by W. H. Allen in 1981 ‚Äì arose from their work for French magazine L'Ercran Fantastique. The pair produced :\\"a series of dossiers on SF TV series for L'Ecran Fantastique: The Prisoner, Star Trek, Twilight Zone and... Doctor Who. For that [Who] dossier [Jean-Marc Lofficier] interviewed Terrance Dicks and Graham Williams. Then I sent them a courtesy copy. Terrance passed it on to Christine Donougher at W. H. Allen who saw an opportunity to publish it as a book.\\" This title in turn led to the Lofficiers producing several novelizations and editing various anthologies of science fiction and fantasy short stories. =Animation and comics= In 1985, Randy Lofficier completed Harry Love's Animation Writing Seminar at Hanna-Barbera, which led the Lofficiers to write a number of animation scripts for television series such as The Real Ghostbusters and Duck Tales. They also began to write numerous scripts for a variety of comic books, often in collaboration with other writers, notably Roy Thomas and Marv Wolfman, for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics. Their best-known works include a trilogy of DC Elseworlds based on German Expressionism cinema incorporating characters such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, the Book of the Vishanti back-up feature for Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme, two stories for Clive Barker‚Äôs Hellraiser, and the Tongue*Lash series for Dark Horse Comics. From 2000 to 2003, Jean-Marc Lofficier was editor and senior writer of a line of French comic books published by Semic Comics, redeveloping old French characters from the 1960s such as Wampus, Kabur, Phenix, Homicron, Dragut and Dick Demon into more modern versions, even gathering a number of them in the mini-series Strangers published by Image Comics in 2003.Starnger No More ‚Äì Lofficier on Semic/Image's Strangers, Newsarama, November 12, 2002 This universe of characters is now gathered as Hexagon Comics. The Lofficiers also wrote \\"Blood Oath\\" a crossover between Phenix and Top Cow's Witchblade. Witchblade Teams With Semic Heroines, Newsarama, June 10, 2003 Frenchblade: Semic's Witchblade: Witchblade , Newsarama, December 5, 2004 Starting in 2010, the Lofficiers started to reprint the \\"classic\\" stories from the 1960s and 1970s in a series of black & white trade paperbacks, as well as write new stories, mostly by relaunching the comic-book Strangers. Since that date, Jean-Marc has been editor-in-chief of Hexagon Comics. Also for the French comic market, the Lofficiers wrote a trilogy of graphic novels based on the character of Robur created by Jules Verne. Illustrated by Gil Formosa, the first two volumes were nominated for the 2005 Jules Verne Award for Bandes Dessinees. There were published in English in Heavy Metal. =Translation= In 1985, the Lofficiers were hired by French artist Moebius to translate and arrange for the publication of his works in English. This led to a series of 30+ graphic novels published mostly by Epic Comics until 1995. During that time, the Lofficiers also translated numerous French comics for Dark Horse Comics, co-editing their comic Cheval Noir, and for Renegade Press, co-editing their comic French Ice, featuring the series Carmen Cru by French artist Jean- Marc Lelong. In 1990, in recognition of their career as writers, translators and editors, the Lofficiers were presented with the Inkpot Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comic Arts. =Pulps and science-fiction= In 2003, the Lofficiers created their own small press, Black Coat Press, to translate and publish classics of French pulp literature into English, relying in part on the output of British writer/translator Brian Stableford. In 2005, the Lofficiers started another small press, Rivi√®re Blanche, to publish French science fiction novels in the nostalgic style of the long-defunct Anticipation imprint of Editions Fleuve Noir. Lofficier's official website includes a section entitled \\"Illustrated History of the French Saint Novels\\", a guide to French-language novels based upon the character of Simon Templar (alias \\"The Saint\\"), created by Leslie Charteris.

Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd () was an Iranian dynast from the Ispahbudhan family, who served as the spahbed (\\"military marshal\\") of the northwestern quarter (kust) of Adurbadagan during the reign of Boran () and Yazdegerd III (). Rostam is remembered as a historical figure, a character in the Persian epic poem Shahnameh (\\"Book of Kings\\"), and as a touchstone of most Iranian nationalists.  Background  Rostam was a member of the House of Ispahbudhan, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, which formed the elite aristocracy of the Sasanian Empire; the family traced its descent back to military marshals (spahbed), and occupied important offices in the realm. According to a romanticized legend about their origin, a daughter of the Parthian/Arsacid king Phraates IV (), named Koshm, married a \\"general of all Iranians\\"; their offspring bore the title of \\"Aspahpet Pahlav\\", later forming the Ispahbudhan clan. Through their Arsacid lineage, the Ispahbudhan claimed to be descendants of Darius III and Esfandiyar. Under the Sasanians, the Ispahbudhan enjoyed such a high status that they were acknowledged as \\"kin and partners of the Sasanians\\". Indeed, Rostam's father Farrukh Hormizd was the first-cousin of the Sasanian King of Kings (shahanshah) Khosrow II (), while his great-grandfather Shapur was the first cousin of shahanshah Khosrow I (). Although the hereditary homeland of the Ispahbudhan seems to have been Khorasan, the family in the course of time came to rule the northwestern quarter (kust) of Adurbadagan (not to be confused with the namesake province of Adurbadagan). Rostam's birthplace is hence reported to be in Armenia, Adurbadagan, Hamadan, or Ray. Rostam had a brother named Farrukhzad, who was active in Ctesiphon and enjoyed a great status there, reportedly being a favourite of Khosrow II.  War with the Byzantine Empire  Map of the northwestern Sasanian province of Adurbadagan In 602, the Byzantine emperor Maurice () was murdered by his political rival Phocas. As a result, Khosrow II proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. During the two decade war, Khosrow was initially successful, conquering the Roman provinces in the Near East, including Egypt. During the third phase of the war (624), however, the tables turned heavily, with the new Byzantine emperor Heraclius conquering Transcaucasia, thus leaving the northwestern Sasanian realm exposed. During this period, many Iranian grandees became dissatisfied with the rule of Khosrow II, not only due to the Byzantine victories but also his policies. This included Rostam, who at the head of 10,000 soldiers, rebelled in the Adurbadagan province. Around the same time, Heraclius invaded Adurbadagan, sacking the city of Ganzak. The modern historian Parvaneh Pourshariati proposes two possibilities behind the success of Heraclius' invasion of Adurbadagan; one being that the significance of the rebellion allowed him to attack the province; the other being that Farrukh Hormizd stopped supporting Khosrow II, as a result allowing Heraclius to attack Adurbadagan. By 627, the distinguished Mihranid general Shahrbaraz had mutinied, while Farrukh Hormizd secretly conspired with him against Khosrow II. The following year, Khosrow II was overthrown by several powerful factions within the empire, which included; Shahrbaraz, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and the Kanarang. The factions installed Khosrow II's son Kavad II on the throne, who soon had his father executed.  Civil war in Iran  =Reign of Kavad II, Ardashir III and Shahrbaraz= The fall of Khosrow II culminated in the Sasanian civil war of 628‚Äì632, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (Parsig) and Parthian (Pahlav) noble-families were also resumed, which broke up the wealth of the nation. A few months later, the devastating Plague of Sheroe swept through the western Sasanian provinces. Half the population, including Kavad II himself, perished. He was succeeded by his eight-year-old son, who became Ardashir III. Ardashir's ascension was supported by both the Pahlav, Parsig, and a third major faction named the Nimruzi. However, sometime in 629, the Nimruzi withdrew their support for the king, and started to conspire with Shahrbaraz to overthrow him. The Pahlav, under their leader Farrukh Hormizd, began supporting Khosrow II's daughter Boran as the new ruler of Iran, who subsequently started minting coins in the Pahlav areas of Amol, Nishapur, Gurgan and Ray. On 27 April 630, Ardashir III was killed by Shahrbaraz, who in turn was murdered, after a reign of forty days, in a coup by Farrukh Hormizd. Farrukh Hormizd then helped Boran ascend the throne, sometime in late June 630. =Reign of Boran, Shapur-i Shahvaraz and Azarmidokht= Coin of Azarmidokht with the bust of her father Khosrow II to the left Boran's accession was most likely due to her being the only remaining legitimate heir of the empire able to rule, along with her sister Azarmidokht. However, she was deposed in 630, and Shapur-i Shahrvaraz, the son of Shahrbaraz and a sister of Khosrow II, was made ruler of Iran. When he was not recognized by the Parsig faction of the powerful general Piruz Khosrow, he was deposed in favor of Azarmidokht. Farrukh Hormizd, in order to strengthen his authority and create a harmonious modus vivendi between the Pahlav and Parsig families, asked Azarmidokht (who was a Parsig nominee) to marry him. Not daring to refuse, she had him killed with the aid of the Mihranid aristocrat Siyavakhsh, who was the grandson of Bahram Chobin, the famous military commander and briefly monarch of Iran. Rostam, who was at that time stationed in Khorasan, succeeded him as the leader of the Pahlav. In order to avenge his father, he left for Ctesiphon, in the words of the 9th century historian Sayf ibn Umar, \\"defeating every army of Azarmidokht that he met\\". He then defeated Siyavakhsh's forces at Ctesiphon and captured the city. Azarmidokht was shortly afterwards blinded and killed by Rostam, who restored Boran to the throne in June 631. Boran complained to him about the state of the empire, which was at that time in a state of frailty and decline. She reportedly invited him to administer its affairs, and so allowed him to assume overall power. Silver coin of Boran A settlement was reportedly made between the family of Boran and Rostam: according to Sayf, it stated that the queen should \\"entrust him [i.e., Rostam] with the rule for ten years,‚Äù at which point sovereignty would return \\"to the family of Sasan if they found any of their male offspring, and if not, then to their women\\". Boran deemed the agreement appropriate, and had the factions of the country summoned (including the Parsig), where she declared Rostam as both the leader of the country and its military commander. The Parsig faction agreed, with Piruz Khosrow being entrusted to administer the country alongside Rostam. The Parsig agreed to work with the Pahlav because of the fragility and decline of Iran, and also because their Mihranid collaborators had been temporarily defeated by Rostam. However, the cooperation between the Parsig and Pahlav would prove short- lived, due to the unequal conditions between the two factions, with Rostam's faction having a much more significant portion of power under the approval of Boran. In the following year a revolt broke out in Ctesiphon. While the imperial army was occupied with other matters, the Parsig, dissatisfied with the regency of Rostam, called for the overthrow of Boran and the return of the prominent Parsig figure Bahman Jaduya, who had been dismissed by her. Boran was killed shortly after; she was presumably strangled by Piruz Khosrow. Hostilities were thus resumed between the two factions. Not long afterwards, both Rostam and Piruz Khosrow were threatened by their own men, who had become alarmed by the declining state of the country. Rostam and Piruz Khosrow thus agreed to work together once more, installing Boran's nephew Yazdegerd III (632‚Äì651) on the throne, and so putting an end to the civil war. Coin of a young Yazdegerd III, the last Sasanian monarch of Iran = Accession of Yazdegerd III and end of the civil war = Yazdegerd was crowned in the Anahid fire-temple in Istakhr, where he had been hiding during the civil war. The temple was the very place where the first Sasanian shahanshah Ardashir I () had crowned himself, indicating that the reason behind Yazdegerd's coronation at the same place was due to hopes for a rejuvenation of the empire. He was almost the last living member of the House of Sasan. Most scholars agree that Yazdegerd was eight years old at his coronation. At his accession, he assigned Rostam with the defense of the empire, telling him \\"Today you are the [most prominent] man among the Persians.\\" Although being acknowledged as the rightful monarch by both the Parsig and Pahlav factions, Yazdegerd did not seem to have held sway over all of his empire. Indeed, during the first years of his rule coins were only minted in Pars, Sakastan, and Khuzestan, approximately corresponding to the regions of the southwest (XwarwarƒÅn) and southeast (Nƒìmr≈çz), where the Parsig was based. The Pahlav, who were mainly based in the northern portion of the empire, refused to mint coins of him. = The Arab invasion of the Sasanian Empire = Throughout this period the great expansion of Arab-Muslim armies had slowly been penetrating the south-western frontiers under Caliph Umar ibn al-KhattƒÅb. The Persians had repeatedly blocked this advance and in 634 the Caliph's army suffered a seemingly decisive defeat at the Battle of the Bridge. The Sasanian general Bahman Jaduya, though, was ordered back to Ctesiphon by Rostam in order to put down a revolt in his own capital city. Caliph Umar's forces retreated, only to launch a successful assault three years later. Sasanian Mesopotamia and its surroundings. In 636, Yazdegerd III ordered Rostam Farrokhzad to subdue the Muslim Arabs invading Iran and then told him: \\"Today you are the [most prominent] man among the Iranians. You see that the people of Iran have not faced a situation like this since the family of Ardashir I assumed power.\\" Yazdegerd then said: \\"the Arabs and their exploits since they have camped at Qadisiyyah and ... what the Iranians have suffered at their hands.\\" Rostam then replied by saying that the Arabs were \\"a pack of wolves, falling upon unsuspecting shepherds and annihilating them.\\" However, Yazdegerd then argued with him and said: \\"It is not like that. I put the question to you in the expectation that you would describe them clearly and that then I would be able to reinforce you so that you might act according to the [real situation]. But you did not say the right thing.\\" Yazdegerd \\"then compared the Arabs to an eagle who looked upon a mountain where birds take shelter at night and stay in their nests at the foot of it. In the morning the birds recognized that the eagle is preying upon them. Whenever a bird became separated from the rest, the eagle snatched him. When the birds saw him [doing this], they did not take off out of fear ... If they had taken off all at once, they would have repelled him. The worst thing that could happen to them would be that all would escape save one. But if each group acted in turn and took off separately, they all perished. This was the similarity between them and the Iranians.\\" Rostam, however, did not agree with Yazdegerd and then told him: \\"O king, let me [act in my own way]. The Arabs still dread the Iranians as long as you do not arouse them against me. It is to be hoped that my good fortune will last and that God will save us the trouble.\\" Rostam then said: \\"We should employ the right ruse,\\" he insisted. \\"In war, patience is superior to haste, and the order of the day is now patience. To fight one army after another is better than a single [and total] defeat and is also harder on our enemy.\\" Yazdegerd, however, was too young and stubborn to listen to Rostam. Before the Muslim Arabs and the Sasanians engaged in battle, Rostam tried to negotiate with the Arabs. He therefore sent them a letter saying: After having read the letter, the Arabs did as Rostam asked and sent a man named Zuhrah. However, the negotiations with him did not go well, which made Rostam ask for another messenger, and thus a man named Mughirah ibn Shubah was sent. Rostam then told Mughirah: \\"We are firmly established in the land, victorious over our enemies, and noble among nations. None of the kings has our power, honor, dominion.\\" While Rostam was talking, Mughirah interrupted him and said: \\"If you need our protection, then be under our protection, and pay the poll tax out of hand in humility; otherwise it is the sword.\\" Feeling greatly insulted and angered, Rostam threatened Mughirah and said: \\"Dawn will not break upon you tomorrow before I kill you all\\". Rostam, while preparing to face the Arab army, wrote a letter to his brother Farrukhzad, telling him to gather an army and then go to Azerbaijan where he should pray for him. Rostam also reminded Farrukhzad that Yazdegerd III was the only legacy left from the Sasanians. Rostam then set out from Ctesiphon in command of a large Sasanian force to confront the Arab- Muslim army of Caliph Umar on the western bank of the Euphrates River at the plains of al-QƒÅdisiyyah, a now abandoned city in southern Mesopotamia, southwest of al-Hillah and al-K≈´fah in Iraq. = Death = There are multiple accounts detailing the death of Rostam, but all of them state that he perished during the battle. One account states that Rostam was found dead in the sandstorm with over 600 wounds on his body.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. However, the Persians were not aware of his death and continued to fight. The Sassanid right wing counter-attacked and gained its lost position, as the Muslims' left wing retreated back to their original position. The Muslims' left center, now under Qa‚Äôqa's command, when denied the support of their left wing, also retreated back to its original position.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. A version from Ya'qubi further elaborates that Dhiraar bin Al-Azwar, Tulayha, Amru bin Ma'adi Yakrib and Kurt bin Jammah al-Abdi were the men that discovered the corpse of Rostam.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Two additional narratives also exist, but both have been suggested to likely be the untrustworthy inventions of later story-tellers intending to mock and romanticize the incident respectively. They are as follows: # During the final day of the battle, there was a heavy sandstorm facing the Sasanian army. Rostam used a camel loaded with weapons as shelter to avoid the sandstorm. Not knowing that Rostam was behind, HilƒÅl ibn \`Ullafah accidentally cut the girdle of the load on the camel. The weapons fell on Rostam and broke his back leaving him half dead and paralyzed. Hilal beheaded Rostam and shouted \\"I swear by the God of Kaaba that I have killed Rostam.\\" Shocked by the head of their legendary leader dangling before their eyes, the Sassanid soldiers were demoralized, and the commanders lost control of the army. Many Sassanid soldiers were slain in the chaos, with some escaping through the river, and finally the rest of the army surrendered. However, due to the presence of inconsistencies, literary devices, and comedic elements, it has been suggested that this account is unreliable and highly improbable, with even the identity the Arab soldier that delivered the death blow being disputed. # A second account, likely developed in response to the first, instead has Rostam face the Arab commander, Sa'd, in personal combat. During the fight, Rostam is temporarily blinded by the sandstorm which gives his opponent an opportunity to strike and kill him. = Aftermath = The defeat of Rostam's army heavily demoralized the people of the Sasanian Empire. Soon, after Rostam's death, many more Sasanian veterans were killed, which included: Piruz Khosrow, Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih, Mardanshah in 642, and Siyavakhsh and Muta of Dailam in 643. In 651, Yazdegerd III was murdered by Mahuy Suri, and the Arabs conquered Khorasan soon after. Personality and skills The Shahnameh describes him as: \\"A sagacious, warlike and one who had been a conqueror.

He contributed three books on eschatology: Paradise Restored (1985), The Days of Vengeance (1987), and The Great Tribulation (1987). His book Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider (1981) was a response to Ronald J. Sider's best-selling book, Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger: A Biblical Study (1977), which promoted various programs of wealth redistribution by the government. Chilton argued that the Bible either does not authorize such programs or explicitly teaches against them. His book Power in the Blood: A Christian Response to AIDS (1987) was primarily dealing with the Church's relationship with the world. Jule Ingersoll notes that Chilton was the Reconstructionist specialist on postmillennialism, and that while Rousas Rushdoony was the \\"architect of the theological and philosophical system\\", Chilton was the \\"general contractor in charge of developing and popularizing postmillennialism.\\" Early years David Chilton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1951. At the age of one, he moved with his Christian missionary parents to the Philippines. At the age of 8, the family returned to the United States where his father became a pastor in Southern California. Growing up in California in the 1970s youth movement and hippie culture, he experienced a conversion to Christianity while listening to a missionary speak at his father's church. He began reading the Bible and teaching Bible studies. The young Chilton consequently became deeply involved in the nascent Jesus People movement, and started a singing group with his sister Jayn and some friends called The Children of Light. He frequently spoke, performed music, and taught Bible studies at Christian coffeehouses in Los Angeles, California region. He was ordained in the Jesus People Movement by Pat Boone. Chilton came to prominence as a writer for the Chalcedon Report edited by R.J. Rushdoony after a Christian friend recommended one of Rushdoony's books. At the same time, Chilton discovered the writings of the Puritans, and was exposed for the first time to Reformed theology as a result of reading these books, and to the doctrines of predestination, election, and perseverance of the saints. After meeting Rushdoony, Chilton was asked to write a monthly column for Chalcedon Report while alternating speaking for Dr. Rushdoony at his church in Hollywood (which was affiliated with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) while pastoring a church in Anaheim, California. At this time Chilton was also influenced by fellow Christian Reconstructionists Greg Bahnsen and James B. Jordan. He married his wife, Darlene, and had 3 children, Nathan, Jacob, and Abigail. In 1981, after several years of pastoring in Anaheim, Chilton wrote his first book, Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider over the course of a month with a pencil and paper at a coffeehouse. Not long after the completion of the book, he moved to Placerville, CA to pastor a church for a year, during which he wrote a newsletter for Christian teachers and homeschoolers called The Biblical Educator. Chilton also used his influence to help launch World Magazine with Joel Belz and wrote a monthly column for the publication for years, which was very popular. Although Chilton loved the people of Placerville and did not want to leave, he accepted a job offer from prominent Reconstructionist (and Rushdoony son-in-law) Gary North as a research assistant at The Institute for Christian Economics in Tyler, Texas. It was during his three-year stay in Texas that North commissioned Chilton to write his two books for North's imprint Dominion Press: Paradise Restored and Days of Vengeance. Later years In 1986 Chilton accepted an offer to return to Placerville to pastor the church there. He continued to work in pastoral ministry, speak at conferences, write a weekly column for The Sacramento Union newspaper, was counsel for The Fieldstead Co. at an economic conference in Switzerland and wrote his last two books, The Great Tribulation and Power in the Blood. Whitefield Theological Seminary awarded him with 2 degrees: The Master of Divinity in the field of Pastoral Theology in 1990 and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the field of Christian Thought in 1992, primarily for his work on Days of Vengeance. Death In 1994, Chilton suffered a massive heart attack and went into a six-week coma. He slowly began to recover, though he had difficulty speaking. During this time, he wrote a monthly column on the family for Ligonier Ministries. He took his second speaking trip to Australia for a month of engagements and also spoke at a church in The Bahamas. In 1997, Chilton suffered his second heart attack and died at the age of 45 years. Books * Chilton, David. 1982, 1986. Productive Christians In An Age Of Guilt Manipulators.

At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to the managers of the African Steamship Company at Liverpool, making several voyages to the west coast of Africa. By the time he was twenty-six he had risen to be manager of the business. Not finding sufficient scope in this post, he borrowed money to purchase two or three small sailing vessels, and started in the shipping business on his own account. The venture succeeded, and he made additions to his fleet, but after a few years' successful trading, realizing that sailing ships were about to be superseded by steamers, he sold his vessels. About this time (1891) Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., who purchased the business of the old African Steamship Company, offered him a managerial post. This offer he accepted, subject to Messrs. Elder, Dempster selling him a number of their shares, and he thus acquired an interest in the business, and subsequently, by further share purchases, its control. took a keen interest in imperial affairs. He acquired considerable territorial interests in West Africa, and financial interests in many of the companies engaged in opening up and developing that part of the world. Elder Dempster employed both E.D. Morel and Roger Casement who in time became bitter enemies of Jones. Jones (left) with Guglielmo Marconi (in fur coat) and Thomas Henry Barker (Secretary of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce). In the early 1900s Alfred Jones had a monopoly on the Congo-Antwerp mail traffic as well as consular duties representing King Leopold‚Äôs Congo State in Liverpool. Described by W.T. Stead as the \\"Uncrowned King of West Africa\\", Jones had myriad interests. In 1900, in order to supply his ships with bunker fuel, he formed Elder's Navigation Collieries Ltd. and bought the Oakwood and Garth Merthyr colleries near Maesteg in the Llynfi valley, south Wales. He took the leading part in opening up a new line of communication with the West Indies, and in stimulating the Jamaica fruit trade and tourist traffic. He also developed the tourist trade in the Canary Islands and the banana industry there. Jones was instrumental in founding the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and was chairman of the Bank of British West Africa. He was President of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. He had been interested in cotton growing in West Africa and had even distributed cotton seed there. As a result, in 1902, he was approached, and became, inaugural President of the British Cotton Growing Association. Jones was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1901 Birthday Honours list on 9 November 1901, in recognition of services to the West African Colonies, and to Jamaica, and invested as such by King Edward VII at St James's Palace on 17 December 1901. In May 1902 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. Sir Alfred died unmarried on 13 December 1909, leaving large charitable bequests.

It played out in three phases and lasted from the spring of 1794 until 1800.Albert Soboul (dir.), Dictionnaire historique de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, Quadrige/PUF, 1989, p. 217, \\"Chouans/Chouannerie\\" entry by Roger Dupu.] The uprising was provoked principally by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the lev√©e en masse (1793) undertaken by the National Convention. A first attempt at staging an uprising was carried out by the Association bretonne to defend the French monarchy and reinstate the specific laws and customs of Brittany that had been repealed in 1789. The first confrontations broke out in 1792 and developed in stages into a peasant revolt, then guerrilla warfare, and eventually to full- scale battles, ending only with their defeat by forces of the Republic in 1800. Briefer peasant uprisings in other d√©partements such as in Aveyron and Loz√®re are also identified as \\"chouanneries\\". A petite chouannerie broke out in 1815 during the Hundred Days and a final uprising occurred in 1832. Origins In 1791, the adoption of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy caused the peasants around Vannes to rise in defence of their bishop S√©bastien-Michel Amelot against the Republicans of Lorient who wished him to swear the oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution. The following spring, in the area around Quimper, a justice of the peace led several parishes in a rising in the name of King Louis XVI against the local authorities.Albert Soboul (dir.), Dictionnaire historique de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, Quadrige/PUF, 1989, p. 218, entr√©e \\"Chouans/Chouannerie\\" par Roger Dupuy. During the summer of 1792, incidents occurred in the districts of Carhaix (Finist√®re), Lannion, Pontrieux (C√¥tes-d'Armor), Craon, Ch√¢teau-Gontier and Laval (Mayenne), where the peasants opposed a levy of volunteers for the army. At Saint-Ou√´n-des-Toits, in the department of Mayenne, Jean Cottereau (known as Jean Chouan) led the insurgents. His nickname probably came from his imitation of the call of the tawny owl (the chouette hulotte) for a recognition-signal. A reward was put on his head, but nevertheless he reached England in March 1793. The Republican administration recognised him and his brother as the leaders of the revolt. There are at their head, wrote the procureur syndic of Ern√©e, on 28 April 1793, \\"two men whose surname is Cottereau, called Chouan. We have promised a reward to whoever arrests them, but people must take precautions for these two individuals are very brave and very determined. If on your part you could seize them, this would render a true service to the public cause.\\" Course An episode of the Chouannerie, painting by left =First phase 1794-1795= In January 1794, the Vendeans of the Vend√©e militaire, following the setback of the Vir√©e de Galerne, tried to resist the infernal columns of General Louis Marie Turreau. During this time, groups of Chouans north of the Loire took up arms again in the areas crossed by the Vendeans. The Chouannerie was born on the borders of the Mayenne and of the Ille-et-Vilaine, near Foug√®res, Vitr√© and Laval.Christian Le Boutellier, La R√©volution dans le Pays de Foug√®res, Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique et historique de l'arrondissement de Foug√®res, 1989, p.313 These small groups led by Jean Chouan, Aim√© du Boisguy and Jean-Louis Treton (nicknamed Jambe d'Argent, i.e. \\"Silver Leg\\"), regrouped Chouans and Vendeans who survived the Vir√©e de Galerne, leaders who were compromised in the peasant uprisings of March 1793 and even deserters.Roger Dupuy, les Chouans, p.36. Condemned to live in almost total secrecy, the Chouans knew that being captured by the Republicans would mean certain death. Most of them were motivated by a desire to avenge their relatives who had disappeared in the Vir√©e de Galerne. In guerilla warfare, Chouans in groups of a few score or a few hundred men ambushed military detachments, couriers and stagecoaches carrying government funds. They attacked Republican towns, executed informers, constitutional priests and republicans, a large number of them administrators. To oppose the Chouans, Republicans built strongholds or fortified towns which were defended by local territorial guards. They were led by General Jean Antoine Rossignol, chief commander of the Army of the Coasts of Brest. A law enacted on 23 March 1793 mandated that captured insurgents should be executed by firing squad or by guillotine within twenty-four hours. Rossignol also assembled groups of fake Chouan outlaws in order to do as much as possible to discredit the real Chouans. Murders were carried out throughout the whole war with a varying degree of intensity. For example, in the district of Foug√®res, in conflict between some Chouans and a fluctuating number of Republicans, 219 people were assassinated or executed by Chouans and 300 by Republicans. This did not include deaths during fights, summary executions on the battlefield, or executions following the expeditive revolutionary due process of law.D'apr√®s Christian Le Bouteiller, Emile Pautrel, Notions d'Histoire et d'arch√©ologie pour la r√©gion de Foug√®res, p.191 The Chouannerie spread quickly to Brittany and reached the C√¥tes-d'Armor, dominated by the Chevalier de Boishardy. On 15 March it reached Morbihan where Joseph de Fay and B√©jarry (former officers of the Vendean army) assisted by Pierre Guillemot incited a peasant uprising aimed at Vannes. The insurgents were easily countered by the Republicans at the battle of Mangol√©rian. However, in the Finist√®re and the west of the C√¥tes-d'Armor, the Basse-Cornouaille, the L√©on and the Tr√©gor did not take part in the uprising. Georges Cadoudal and Pierre-Mathurin Mercier, nicknamed la Vend√©e, rescued from the battle of Savenay, moved to the Morbihan where Boulainvilliers was appointed general-in-chief of the d√©partement. However, Boulainvilliers defected to Ille-et-Vilaine with money taken from headquarters. S√©bastien de La Haye de Silz succeeded him as general. Boulainvilliers foolishly returned a few months later in the Morbihan; he was captured and shot by Pierre Guillemot's men. Other d√©partements, however, did not stand as united as the Morbihan. In the north of Anjou, Marie Paul de Sc√©peaux de Bois-Guignot was named commander for the north of Maine-et-Loire. His authority later extended to Loire-atlantique, Mayenne and Sarthe. However, he commanded in name only: as in other d√©partements, his authority as a Chouan chief only extended to his own canton. Joseph de Puisaye, a former officer compromised in the federalist revolts, realised the necessity of centralised command and attempted to assume the function of general-in-chief of the Chouans. Recognized by some chiefs, Puisaye embarked from Dinard to London on 11 September 1794 to meet future king Charles X of France. Major-General Pierre Dezoteux de Cormatin, his second-in-command, assumed command in his absence. Charles X favoured absolute monarchy and distrusted Puisaye, who advocated parliamentary monarchy. However, following the intervention of British prime minister William Pitt the Younger, Puisaye was appointed general-in-chief of the Royal and Catholic Army of Brittany on 15 October 1794 with the rank of Lieutenant general (thus entrusting him with the king's authority). His power thus extended to all the insurgent areas north of the Loire, including the Maine and Anjou, where Sc√©peaux appointed him general-in- chief. Maximilien de Robespierre fell on 28 July 1794. Consequently, the Terror ended and the Convention nationale became more flexible and open to negotiation. The Agence royaliste de Paris asked the Chouans in the name of Louis XVIII of France (then count of Provence) to stop fighting. On 26 December, Brigadier General Jean Humbert and Chouan chief Boishardy met to discuss peace options. Puisaye tried to organise a landing from London, his lieutenant Cormatin assumed full command and negotiated the peace treaty of La Mabilais in April 1795. He was followed by a minority of local leaders.Albert Soboul (dir.), Dictionnaire historique de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, Quadrige/PUF, 1989, p. 219, entr√©e \\"Chouans/Chouannerie\\" par Roger Dupuy. Of the 121 leaders attending, only 21, including de Silz and Boishardy, signed the treaty.Voir Quelques dates de l‚Äôhistoire en France, en Bretagne, en Finist√®re et √† Roscoff et l'introduction de Reynald Secher √† la bande-dessin√©e Chouannerie, 1789-1815, Fleurus, 1989. Cadoudal, √©vad√© de Brest, rejette cette paix. =Second phase 1795-1796= Because neither side had negotiated in good faith, there was an increase in tension following the death of Louis XVII on 8 June. The peace was broken on 26 August 1794 as General Lazare Hoche, who succeeded Jean Antoine Rossignol as head of the Army of the Coasts of Brest, ordered the arrest of those who had refused to sign the treaty of La Mabilais. Hoche thought that Cormatin was trying to outsmart him: Cormatin was imprisoned (and would not be freed before 1802). Boishardy, who did not sign, was killed during the night of 17 to 18 June between Br√©hand and Moncontour. Likewise, de Silz, who had taken up arms again, was attacked on 28 June at Grand-Champ by the troops of Adjutant-General Josnet. De Silz was killed in action and his men retreated. On 23 June 1795 a British fleet led by commodore John Borlase Warren landed soldiers of the √©migr√© army in Carnac. They joined Chouans led by Vincent de Tint√©niac, Paul Alexandre du Bois-Berthelot and Jacques Anne Joseph Le Prestre de Vauban, great-grandnephew of marshal S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban. However, disagreements between the general of the √©migr√©s Louis Charles d'Hervilly and the expedition leader Puisaye cost the Royalists precious time. A counter-attack by Hoche forced the Chouans back to the Quiberon peninsula. On 10 July, two columns of Chouan troops wearing English uniforms embarked on British ships from the peninsula and were landed behind Republican lines. However, the men from the first column, led by Lantivy du Rest and Jean Jan, scattered. The second column, led by Vincent de Tint√©niac seconded by Georges Cadoudal, prepared to attack but received a message from the Agence royaliste de Paris requiring them to join a second British landing at C√¥tes-d'Armor. Tint√©niac hesitated in the face of opposition from Cadoudal, but obeyed the order. He was killed on the way at Co√´tlogon on 18 July. They reached the bay of Saint-Brieuc but no British fleet joined them, so they returned to the Morbihan and appointed Cadoudal as their general. battle of Quiberon Un √©pisode de l'affaire de Quiberon (An Episode of the Quiberon affair), painting by Paul-√âmile Boutigny, 19th century. During this time, in Quiberon, reinforcements of men led by Charles de Virot de Sombreuil joined the √©migr√©s. They attempted to attack on 16 July but were crushed. Hoche launched a final assault on 20 July and routed the √©migr√©s. Louis Charles d'Hervilly was fatally wounded; Puisaye managed to board a British ship. The Republicans took more than prisoners. 748 of them were shot by firing squad, including Sombreuil. The day before his execution he wrote a letter to commodore Warren denouncing the flight of chief general Joseph de Puisaye. This letter had an enormous impact on the Chouans. A council of officers in Morbihan sentenced Puisaye to death in absentia. Puisaye returned to Brittany in autumn 1795, where he was arrested by Pierre-Mathurin Mercier and brought before Cadoudal. Puisaye defended himself vigorously and found he still had the support of the count of Artois. Cadoual and Puisaye were eventually reconciled. Guerilla fighting resumed after the failure of the English royalist expedition and spread to Normandy where Louis de Frott√©, freshly landed in France in 1795, organised the uprising. La Chapelle de La Madeleine √† Malestroit (Morbihan) - 15 niv√¥se an III (The Chapel of La Madelaine in Malestroit), painting by Alexandre Bloch, 1886. Puisaye had suffered some loss of reputation and blamed the Chouans of the Morbihan and their chiefs who, according to him, were hostile towards nobles and wanted to \\"establish equality under a white flag\\". Puisaye left the Morbihan for the Ille-et- Vilaine, where the division chiefs were of the nobility, and joined the Mordelles division led by Jean-Joseph Ruault de La Tribonni√®re. He did not receive much more support than he had in the Morbihan, but remained commander- in-chief thanks to the support of the count of Artois. Puisaye wanted a Chouannerie led by nobles and founded the company of the chevaliers catholiques. Several √©migr√©s joined France to fight with the Chouans, but numerous disputes broke out between them. In January 1796, Puisaye joined the Foug√®res division, the most important one in Ille-et-Vilaine, and appointed as his chief Aim√© Picquet du Boisguy, chief general of the Ille-et-Vilaine and of the East of the C√¥tes-d'Armor. However, in practice, Boisguy only controlled the East of Ille-et-Vilaine; Frott√© and Sc√©peaux acknowledged Puisaye as general-in-chief in name only. To fight the Chouans, the Republican forces were organised in three armies. The Army of the Coasts of Brest, led by Lazare Hoche, based alternately in Rennes or Vannes, controlled the Finist√®re, the Morbihan, the C√¥tes-d'Armor, the Ille-et-Vilaine and the Mayenne. The Army of the West, led by Jean Baptiste Camille de Canclaux, based in Nantes, controlled the Loire-Atlantique, le Maine-et-Loire, the Vend√©e and the Deux- S√®vres. The Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg, led by Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet, based in Saint-Malo, controlled the Manche, the Orne, the Calvados, the Sarthe and part of the Ille-et-Vilaine. In December 1795, the Directoire named Hoche chief general of all the Republican forces based in the West and gave him full authority. The armies of the West, of the Coasts of Brest and of the Coasts of Cherbourg were merged to form the Arm√©e des c√¥tes de l'Oc√©an (Army of the Coasts of the Ocean). Despite the Quiberon disaster, the Chouans gained some victories in the coming months. However, Hoche changed tactics in the beginning of 1796. He set up mobile columns, promised amnesty to Chouans who surrendered, guaranteed religious freedom and strove to discipline the army. Many Chouans and Vendeans were amenable to these measures and laid down their arms. Hoche's priority was to pacify the Vend√©e. Jean- Nicolas Stofflet was captured and shot by firing squad in Angers on 25 February 1796. Fran√ßois de Charette was hunted down, imprisoned, and shot on 29 March 1796. His death marked the end of the War in the Vend√©e. Now that the Vend√©e was pacified, Hoche turned his attention to the Chouans. Faced by large Republican numbers, Chouan chiefs gradually surrendered. Sc√©peaux was the first to surrender, on 14 May.Gabriel du Pontavice, les Arm√©es catholiques et royale au nord de la Loire.

Puisaye returned to England. =Third phase= The uprising lasted until Republican victory in 1800. Chouan leaders The principal leaders of the insurrection were Georges Cadoudal, his brother Julian, Jean Cottereau, called Jean Chouan; Pierre Guillemot, known as the king of Bignan; Joseph de Puisaye, Louis- Charles de Sol de Grisolles, Auguste and S√©bastien de La Haye de Silz, John- Louis Treton, nicknamed Jambe d'Argent; Tristan-Llhermitte, Michel Jacquet, known as Taillefer; Joseph-Juste Coquereau, Aim√© du Boisguy, Boishardy, Pierre-Mathurin Mercier and Bonfils de Saint Loup. In Brittany, the Chouans were supported by many nobles: Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rou√´rie, the Chevalier de Boishardy, Count Louis of Rosmorduc, the Picquet brothers of Boisguy, as well as by commoners (the brothers Cadoudal). In Lower Normandy, Count Louis de Frotte had a dominant role. One of the lieutenants in lower Maine was Guillaume Le M√©tayer, who was nicknamed Rochambeau. In the Vendee, the nobility were not able to play their normal military role. There was never any properly organised army; it consisted mostly of small elusive bands. The Chouan leaders were, above all, peasant farmers. In contrast to the earlier War in the Vendee of 1793, the Chouannerie did not possess any territory, the cities and many towns having remained Republican, but some districts did rise in open revolt. There was also the Petite Vend√©e in lower Maine, controlled by the Prince of Talmont. The Chouannerie was very difficult to suppress as its fighting forces had not been beaten in the battles of the Vendee war, it had many leaders and its army units were small and dispersed.

Heinrich von Morungen or Henry of Morungen (died c. 1220 or 1222) was a German Minnesinger. Life Almost nothing about his life can be deduced from Heinrich's songs. Possibly he is identical with the Hendricus de Morungen who is documented in Thuringia. This Hendricus belonged to the class of minor knights and presumably originated from the castle of Morungen near Sangerhausen. As a \\"retired knight\\" (miles emeritus) he received from his patron, Dietrich IV, Margrave of Meissen, a pension for his \\"high personal merits\\" (alta suae vitae merita). He transferred this in 1213 to the monastery of St Thomas in Leipzig, which he entered himself in 1217. According to 16th century sources, he died there in 1222 after a journey to India. In the Late Middle Ages, there was extant a \\"Ballad of the Noble Moringer\\", which transferred onto Heinrich von Morungen the stock theme of the return of a husband believed lost. Works There survive 35 Minnelieder by Heinrich, with 115 verses, of which only 104 are to be found in the great collection of the Codex Manesse. The melodies have not survived. Heinrich is a very graphic lyricist: he particularly often makes use of images of shining (sun, moon, evening star, gold, jewels, mirror) as comparisons by which to describe the lady who is being sung and praised. An essential theme in Heinrich's work is the demonic nature of Minne, the Middle High German word for this type of love, which for the mediaeval writers was embodied by the ancient classical goddess of love, Venus. Minne is experienced partly as a magical, pathological, even fatal power, but also as a religious and mystical experience. In form and content the poems are influenced by the Proven√ßal troubadour lyric: dactylic rhythms and through-rhymes (Durchreimung) occur frequently. Motifs in the content have also been taken over from the same source: for example, the motif, otherwise rare in German Minnesang, of the \\"notice of termination of the service of love\\" (Lied XXVII), the roots of which are to be found in classical literature (for example Ovid). An introduction often attributed to Heinrich is the Wechsel or exchange (where the two parties speak alternately, but not directly to each other) in the Tagelied, although the device may be found in the poems of Dietmar von Aist, who is believed to be earlier.

A wide variety of coins, such as the plack, bodle, bawbee, dollar and ryal were produced over that time. For trading purposes coins of Northumbria and various other places had been used before that time; and since 1709 those of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and then of the UK. Ancient history and Roman trade (‚Äì400) An example of a dupondius coin of Vespasian (AD 69‚Äì79) typical of the Roman coins deposited at the Cardean Fort Angus in the late first century. The earliest coins in Scotland were introduced by the Roman provinces of Britain that were obtained from trade with the westernmost outpost of the Roman Empire. Far from being isolated, the Celts of Caledonia, north of Hadrian's Wall, developed trade to the general benefit of the population, to the north of the Wall. Roman coins appear over a wide range across the country, especially sites near the Antonine Wall. Hadrian's Wall was also regarded as a means to regulate social traffic and trade north, rather than a military defence against the free northern tribes of the Caledoni.Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 By John T. Koch Civil settlements arose along south of the wall with shops and taverns that facilitated trade between the Empire and free north.Borders and border politics in a globalizing world By Paul Ganster, David E. Lorey It is possible to recognise groupings of coins from certain periods, during the Flavian and Antonine occupations; such as Cardean Fort Angus where Roman dupondius coins AD 69‚Äì79 date to the reign of Emperor Vespasian. Other sites include coins from North Uist dating to the 4th century until recently was thought to be beyond the sphere of known trade routes.Ancient coins discovered on beach, BBC News Online, 12 July 2007 Other native sites include the Fairy Knowe broch Buchlyvie, and the broch and dun at Gargunnock in Stirlingshire. Some sites include substantial silver treasure hoards most likely buried or abandoned in either Roman or native pots. Indicating the Roman governor of Britain paid large sums of money to the inhabitants of southern Scotland and possibly bribing the northern Caledonians to maintain peaceful relations with Romans and the British. Payments to chieftains are recorded in four areas; Edinburgh, Fife, Aberdeen and the Moray Firth.Romans paid Scots protection money, The Independent, 3 November 2000. Retrieved 18 December 2000 This may indicate such discoveries (e.g. the Birnie hoard of between 200‚Äì400 silver coins) were deposited as votive offerings. Examples including coinage of Constantine II (337‚Äì342) with over 20 such hoards found throughout Scotland. Rare examples include a base silver (potin) coin of Ptolemy XIII of Egypt, 80‚Äì51 BC In 410, trade ceased as the Roman Empire withdrew from the island of Albion. Early medieval period (500‚Äì900) As the Roman Empire retreated from Britain, various kingdoms sprouted up to the south of Scotland. One of these, Northumbria, soon expanded into the north as far as the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Thus, it controlled the southern parts of what is now Scotland, and the bronze sceat coins of the Northumbrian Kings circulated freely in what is now Scotland. This coin was issued from 837‚Äì854. Anglo-Saxon coins were minted in Northumberland; however, due to the extensive trade routes of the Vikings, sceat coins were also minted in Frisia and Jutland during Anglo-Saxon times and coins of this period indicate the extent of Scottish trade not only with Northumberland but also with continental Europe. Norsemen also introduced some form of coinage, and coins from as far away as Byzantium and the Arabic countries have been found in sites in Scandinavia, including Norway which had strong links with Scotland in the early Middle Ages. Scottish Penny (‚Äì1602) The first king of Scots to produce his own coinage was David I (). In 1136 he captured Carlisle, including its English mint and nearby silver mines from Stephen, King of England.Coins of Scotland Ireland and the Islands, Peter Seaby and Frank Purvey, page 1. He struck silver pennies, which were similar to those Stephen struck for England, at Carlisle, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Roxburgh and Berwick. For the next two centuries, the continued use of a profile, as opposed to the facing portrait, was about all that distinguished Scottish coins from their English counterparts. In particular, the reverse types of Scottish coins followed the English Tealby, short cross, and long cross designs. Moreover, Scottish coins followed English weight standards, allowing the two coinages to circulate alongside one another.The Coin Atlas, J. Cribb, B. Cook, and I. Carradice, pp. 17‚Äì18 David II of Scotland ended the parity between Scottish and English coins, resulting in an English proclamation banning the lower quality Scottish coins from their country in 1356. Robert III of Scotland continued to devalue Scottish coins, making them worth one-half of their English counterparts by 1392. He also replaced the profile bust on the obverse of Scottish coins with a facing head, which made his coins much easier to confuse with the more valuable English issues.Coins of Medieval Europe, Philip Grierson, pp. 157‚Äì158 David II's attempt to introduce gold coins to Scotland by copying the English noble was a failure but Robert III successfully introduced the gold lion, which showed St. Andrew crucified on his saltire-shaped cross.Coins of Medieval Europe, Philip Grierson, p. 158 Under James III of Scotland English influence of Scottish coinage gave way to Burgundian models, with both his gold rider and silver plack. He is best remembered, however, for the realistic portraits on his silver groat.Coins in History, John Porteous, pages 149‚Äì150. James III also introduced the gold unicorn. This was one of a long series of coin types which characterized continuing changes in standard and revaluations of Scottish coinage.The Coin Atlas, J. Cribb, B. Cook, and I. Carradice, pages 18 Ordinances required Scots to turn in their old coins in exchange for new issues struck to a lower standard, thereby providing a profit to the king.Handbook of Coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum, Herbert A. Greuber, pp. 192 and 194. James VI alone had eight issues of coins before he unified the thrones, and to a large extent the coinages, of Scotland and England.Coins of Scotland Ireland and the Islands, Peter Seaby and Frank Purvey, p. 55. Union of the Crowns (from 1603) In 1604, the year after the Union of the Crowns, the Council ordered Scotland to use the same coinage standards as England. A new gold coin, called a Unit in Scotland or Unite in England, was valued at ¬£12 Scots or ¬£1 sterling. Gold and fine silver coins now had the same sizes and compositions in Scotland and England, but Scotland did maintain its own copper coinage. The Scottish and English coinages both used the same royal title, king of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and when they specified a denomination it was a Roman numeral which could be interpreted as Scottish shillings or English pence. The designs in the two kingdoms had only minor differences. In the North, coins used the Crown of Scotland, decorated by a fleur-de-lis in the center between two crosses, as opposed the English crown, where the placements of the lis and crosses were reversed. Beginning in 1610, Scottish coins also used the Royal coat of arms of Scotland, which placed the Scottish lion in the more prominent positions than the English version.Handbook of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum, Herbert Appold Grueber, page liiThe Coin Atlas, J. Cribb, B. Cook, and I. Carradice, p. 18 In 1636, Charles I made Nicholas Briot master of the Scottish Mint at Edinburgh. With his Scottish son-in-law, Sir John Falconer, Briot replaced Scotland's gold and silver hammered coinage with machine made milled coinage. The English Civil war ended this coinage in 1642. During the war, Scotland struck a few copper coins but after the war the Edinburgh mint closed and Scotland used the regular coins of the Commonwealth of England.The Mint: A History of the London Mint from A.D. 287 to 1948, John Craig, pages 147‚Äì149 Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II King on 5 February 1649, he did not strike coins in Scotland until 1664. His silver denominations were multiples of the merk. At this time, the Scottish one merk coin was similar to an English shilling, but it was valued at 13s 4d Scots. In 1677, Charles II introduced a copper bawbee, valued at 6 pence Scots, with a crowned thistle on the reverse in place of the figure of Britannia on the copper coins he struck in England. James VII of Scotland reverted to silver coins with denominations in shillings, now with the weights adjusted to reflect an exchange rate of 13 shillings Scots to 1 shilling sterling.Coins of Scotland Ireland and the Islands, Peter Seaby and Frank Purvey, pages 79-83 =1707‚Äì1710 recoinage= Following the 1707 union between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, the Scottish silver (but not gold nor copper) coinage was replaced with new silver coins, with the aim of creating a common currency for the new Kingdom of Great Britain as required by the Treaty of Union.Sir Isaac Newton and the Scottish recoinage, 1707‚Äì10, Athol L Murray, Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1997 The exercise was conducted under the guidance of Sir Isaac Newton, who had previously directed the recoinage in England some years earlier in his role as Warden of the Mint (and subsequently as Master of the Mint). Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate since 1603, and a 1697 proclamation setting the ratio at 13:1, a 12:1 ratio (one shilling Scots to one penny sterling) was applied to the recoinage, although compensation was paid. The new coinage was made using Troy weights (12 Troy ounces to the pound), rather than the traditional Scots weights (16 Troy ounces to the pound). Coins were minted in both London and Edinburgh, the latter inscribed with the letter 'E' under the bust of the monarch to permit them to be distinguished. Under the supervision of moneyers from the Tower Mint in London, a weight of 103,346 Troy pounds in crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences were minted at the Edinburgh Mint with a value of ¬£320,372 12s, equivalent to US$20.5 million (¬£17.1 million) at 2017 average silver prices and exchange rates.Price History: 2000 to Present , The Silver Institute This 12:1 ratio is reflected in the fact that sgillinn, which originally meant shilling, became the Scottish Gaelic word for a penny sterling, and bonn-a-sia which literally means \\"coin of six\\" became the word for a halfpenny. Following decimalisation in 1971, sgillinn became and remains the Scottish Gaelic word for a new penny. As a result of the recoinage, foreign coins, which were frequently used alongside the local currency, stopped being legal tender on 6 October 1707. Pre-Union 40-, 20- and 10-shilling coins ceased to be legal tender on 10 February 1708, but were temporarily put back into circulation before finally ceasing to be legal tender on June 1, along with coins of , 1, 2, and 4 merks, 5 shillings, and the 3s 6d coin. The last batch of new coins, consisting of silver shillings and half-crowns were delivered on 5 October 1709, and were to be the last coins to be minted in Scotland. =Subsequent developments= Article 16 of the Treaty of Union stipulated that Scotland was to keep its own mint. Although the Edinburgh Mint retained its permanent officials (though not other staff) for a further hundred years, until 1814, minting ceased a mere two years after Union, despite several subsequent proposals to restart production. The mint itself was finally abolished in 1817 and sold in 1830.The Scottish Mint after the recoinage, 1709‚Äì1836, Athol L Murray, Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1999 Abolition caused a low level of protest, mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, and continued to be protested against by Nationalist pamphlets into the 1950s and beyond. The title of 'Governor of the Mint of Scotland', which passed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Coinage Act 1870, was finally abolished with the passing of the Coinage Act 1971. The transition from Scottish coinage to English did not occur overnight. Scottish coinage was still in circulation in the later 18th century, but the changeover was made a little easier due to common currency in the nomenclature. Pound Sterling is still translated as Punnd Sasannach (English pound) in Scottish GaelicThe Scottish Gaelic Column, Scottish Radiance Certain old coin names, such as bawbee,Bawbee, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1894 continued in colloquial usage into the 20th century. Others, such as mark and dollar, would be more associated with various foreign currencies by contemporary Scots. Some British coins later had explicitly Scottish reverses: for example the shilling appeared with either English or Scottish royal arms as reverses from 1937 to 1970, while its replacement the 5p coin had a crowned thistle from 1971 to 2008. Currently, three Scottish banks produce their own banknotes (Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank), but no coinage. Scotland is the only part of the UK where one pound notes are still in usage (although they can be found in the Isle of Man and Channel Islands). List of Scottish coins As with Scottish weights and measures, many of the Scottish denominations bore the same names as those in England, but were of slightly different values. The dates, and first kings to issue them are included: * Pistole ‚Äì Gold, 12 pounds Scots * Dollar ‚Äì Replacement for the ryal, 60 Scots shillings (James VI) * Ryal ‚Äì Gold, 1565 * Crown or Lion ‚Äì Gold (James I) * Half-crown, Demi-Lion or Demys ‚Äì Gold (James I) * Ducat or \\"bonnet\\" ‚Äì 40 shillings, 1539 (James V) * Mark or merk ‚Äì Gold (giving rise to the term markland) * Noble ‚Äì Gold, worth half a mark, 1357 (David II, reintroduced by Robert III) * Unicorn ‚Äì Gold, 18 shillings Scots, 1484‚Äì85 (James III) * Half-unicorn ‚Äì Gold, 9 shillings Scots (James IV) * Testoun ‚Äì silver, 1553.

He was hanged on Leith sands in Scotland along with two of his crew on 11 April 1705.. Green was celebrated in a contemporary ballad: The Worcester was seized, probably at the bequest of the Secretary of the Company of Scotland (Roderick Mackenzie), when she came into the Firth of Forth simply to weather a storm; Green and his crew were alleged to have boarded a ship, the ironically named Speedy Return, off the Malabar coast in India, killed the crew, stolen the goods on board, then sold the ship. However, the evidence against Green has been considered flimsy; during the trial, the ship in question was never named, and neither the ship's owner nor any next of kin of the alleged deceased came forward. Furthermore, the exact time and place of the incident were never specified (\\"upon one or other Days of the Months of February, March, April or May, in the year 1703\\").. As the alleged incident was outside Scottish waters, the veracity of the trial was also called into question; however the prosecution argued that the subjects of the piracy had, according to different witnesses, either sailed under an English flag or had spoken English, and as such, Green and his crew were subject to the justice of Admiralty. To further dispel any pretence of a fair trial, many of the crew were forbidden to provide evidence, and one of those who was allowed - the captain's Indian servant - had been \\"chained and nailed to the Floor of the Fore-Castle\\" at the time of the alleged incident.\\". The evidence given by this hardly objective witness was accepted. The English historian G. M. Trevelyan complained that while \\"the 'evidence' did not even pretend to be more than hearsay [...] the court [was] drunk with patriotic prejudice.\\". Green was sentenced to death, originally intended for the 3 April 1705, but this was postponed for a time at the request of the Queen's Privy Council. During this time it became known to those involved in the trial that survivors of the Speedy Return had arrived back in England, and were ready to testify to the innocence of Green and his colleagues. Nevertheless, the Crown's Scottish representatives failed to stand up to an angry Edinburgh mob, and did not postpone the execution date further. Green and two of his crew members, an Englishman, Simpson, and John Madder, a Scot, were found guilty and hanged on Leith Sands on 11 April. The men met their deaths, amongst the braying mob, with calm and resolve. It is probable that the Worcester was seized in an act of revenge against the East India Company (for whom Green had earlier worked) that had seized one of the last ships of the Company of Scotland, the Annandale, the previous year. After the executions of the three, the remaining crewmen were quietly released with no further charge. The incident caused great consternation and anger throughout much of England and provided fodder for the vitriolic patriots on both sides of the border. Trevelyan concluded that the deaths of the three men served as an outlet for a widely held Scottish resentment of their Anglo-centric government's mismanagement. Examples of the problems partially caused by this mis- governance included the Glencoe Massacre, the ill-fated Darien Scheme (the failure of which was partially attributable to King William's concession to English mercantile interest) and the \\"seven ill years\\" (seven bad harvests experienced by Scottish farmers between 1692 and 1698, blame for which must also lie partially with archaic tools, expertise and practices in use at that time).

Music career During the infancy of the band's career, while they were playing as the Detours (around mid-1962), Sandom, a bricklayer, joined as drummer. However, while the other members of the band were in their late teens, Sandom was in his early thirties, and the age difference caused problems within the band. Sandom's wife also objected to him staying out into the later hours of the night.Fletcher, Tony. Moon: Life and Death of a Rock Legend. 1. New York, NY: HarperEntertainment, 2000. pp76 In February 1964, the band discovered that there was another group called the Detours. On Valentine's Day in 1964, they changed their name to the Who. When the band secured, but failed, an audition with Fontana Records in early 1964, the label's producer, Chris Parmeinter, expressed a dislike for Sandom's drumming. The band's then-manager, Helmut Gordon, and lead guitarist Pete Townshend agreed. Townshend suggested to the other members, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle, that Sandom leave the band. Sandom gave a month's notice, and left in April. Within a month of Sandom's departure, Keith Moon was hired after he approached the band at one of their gigs and told them he could play better than the session drummer they had hired to fill the vacancy left by Sandom. No recordings with Sandom playing with the band were ever released. On his departure from the group, Sandom said, \\"I wasn't so ambitious as the rest of them. I'd done it longer than what they had. Of course, I loved it. It was very nice to be part of a band that people followed, it was great. But I didn't get on well with Peter Townshend. I was a few years older than he was, and he thought I should pack it in more or less because of that. I thought I was doing all right with the band, we never got slung out of nowhere, we always passed our auditions.\\"Fletcher, Tony. Moon: Life and Death of a Rock Legend. 1. New York, NY: HarperEntertainment, 2000. pp77 According to Townshend's book Who I Am, Sandom was hurt by Townshend's comments that he should leave especially because a few months earlier, when the band failed an audition due to a record executive describing Pete Townshend as \\"gangly, noisy, and ugly\\", Sandom had himself defended Townshend against being ousted from the band, something that Townshend was not aware of at the time. Sandom published his autobiography The Who Before the Who in 2014, to which Townshend contributed a foreword. Death Sandom died on 27 February 2019.

Born in Dessau, he first studied under Theodore Muller. During his life, he worked for the Grand Opera in Paris and became acquainted with Franz Liszt, with whom he went to Weimar. In 1866, Cossmann was appointed professor of cello studies at the Moscow Conservatory. However, in 1878, Cossmann helped found the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he occupied the post of teacher of cello. Cossmann was not only a frequent soloist and quartet member, but was also a composer. His works include three fantasias, Tell, Euryanthe, and multiple solo works for various instruments. In addition, he composed many etudes and studies for the cello, many of which are still used today. In 1890 Cossmann adapted the Erlk√∂nig from Franz Schubert for solo cello for the exclusive use of his student Heinrich Kiefer. He wrote this in his score on Frankfurt 28. Nov. 1890 by B. Cossmann. Bernhard Cossmann, author of many original works and of diverse ‚ÄúPhantasien‚Äù on motifs from operas (such as Freischutz, Euryanthe, etc.) as well as on well-known pieces (also for solo cello such as ‚ÄúParaphrase sur une chanson populaire allemande Ach, wie ist‚Äôs m√∂glich dann. Th√ºringen Volkslied‚Äù), had formerly dedicated his F√ºnf Neue Concert Etuden to Heinrich Kiefer. The transcription of the Erlk√∂nig was given to Kiefer in manuscript, for his exclusive use, because with his great talent he would be able to explore the possibilities of the piece and bring it to life; we know that in reality Kiefer studied the Erlk√∂nig prepared by his maestro very carefully and wrote another copy (now in a private collection) with many alterations. Cossmann‚Äôs transcription reveals a truly deep knowledge of the cello and of its peculiar potential: nowhere does it show, for example, any influence of the transcription for violin of H.W. Ernst; and in it we can see the reasons for the special admiration that Bernhard Cossman and the Italian virtuoso Alfredo Piatti had for each other, as Carl Fuchs tells us: ‚ÄúAlfredo Piatti was one of the great ‚Äòcellists. He dedicated to my master Cossmann his Twelve Caprices, beautiful studies. The admiration of these two great ‚Äòcellists was mutual, for Cossmann dedicated his five great Concert Studies (op.10) to Piatti.‚Äù.[Musical and other Recollections of Carl Fuchs ‚Äòcellist, Sherratt and Hughes, The Saint Ann‚Äôs Press, 1937, pages 51-52]. He died in Frankfurt. One of his sons, Paul Nikolaus Cossmann (born 1869), author of a brief book on Hans Pfitzner (1904), died of typhus at Theresienstadt in 1942.

Formed in 1995, as a high school club, their primary campaigns are to advocate against factory farming and promote vegetarian eating. While the group welcomes those who are interested in animal welfare who eat meat, it encourages a transition to a plant-based diet, even if gradual or part-time. Activities and campaigns Animal Outlook's activities and campaigns include: * Organizing and hosting of DC VegFest. * Organizing and promotion of VegWeek. * Distribution of pro-veg materials. * Outreach and campaigns advocating for restaurants and companies to include vegan food. * Creation and distribution of pro-vegetarian commercials on television. * Writing letters and op-eds to local newspapers. As of 2016, Animal Outlook has completed its eighth annual VegWeek. VegWeek is an international campaign in which people make a pledge to eat a plant-based diet for one week. In 2016, more than 5,400 people took the 7-Day VegPledge. Participants of VegWeek campaigns have included federal, state, and local representatives, athletes and celebrities, and community members.US VegWeek . 15 May 2014. =Campaign successes= * The organization has since launched successful campaigns urging Morningstar Farms, Boca, and LightLife to use fewer eggs in their products. * Animal Outlook launched a campaign for Dunkin' Donuts to stock soy milk in its shops, which the company did in certain regions. At the 2009 Taking Action for Animals conference hosted by the Humane Society of the United States, Erica Meier introduced Animal Outlook's follow-up campaign to urge Dunkin' Donuts to remove animal products from its donuts. * A successful campaign, in which Animal Outlook supporters sent messages asking for vegan options at WeLoveSubway.com, helped lead to menu items including a black bean patty and the Malibu Garden sandwich, being added by Subway‚Äîthe world's largest restaurant chain. More than 1,000 Subway locations now offer these options. * Tim Horton's‚ÄîCanada's largest coffee chain, with more than 4,500 locations‚Äîadded soy milk at participating locations, following a campaign by Animal Outlook. * Animal Outlook teamed up with journalist and TV personality Jane Velez-Mitchell to launch a petition asking Starbucks to add vegan food options to its menu, in light of the positive steps the coffee chain has already taken by offering soy and coconut milks. In response to the many messages received, Starbucks has told Animal Outlook, \\"We are in the testing stages for several new products that would qualify as vegan... we have our vegan customers in the forefront of our minds and can't wait to present some new food options to accommodate the vegan diet and our loyal customers that have requested these options.\\" Undercover investigations Animal Outlook has conducted multiple undercover investigations into conditions facing animals raised for food in the U.S. =Egg farms= The group conducted an investigation into the living conditions at Maryland henhouses, documenting corpses found in group cages and rescuing some of the hens found in the worst conditions. One of the farms documented, owned by ISE America, housed more than 800,000 hens. Following a tip about substandard conditions at the farm, Animal Outlook requested permission to visit the farm before proceeding with an undercover investigation. The spokesperson for the owner of the farm in question said that the conditions found at the farm were \\"normal industry practices.\\" While one of the farms asserted that the video footage was not taken at its farm, Animal Outlook had filmed its GPS location as well as mail addressed to the farm in question. In early 2006, an Animal Outlook investigation inside a Pennsylvania egg farm led to criminal charges of 35 counts of animal cruelty against the owner and manager of the farm, the first case of its kind. Although, charges were pressed by a local animal control officer after viewing a video provided by Animal Outlook, the owner and manager of the farm were eventually acquitted in 2007. =Central Valley Meat= Animal Outlook's undercover video exposing animal abuse at Central Valley Meat Co. (CVM) prompted the USDA to shut down the California slaughterhouse in 2012 and suspend federal purchases from the facility, a major supplier to the USDA's National School Lunch Program. California-based fast food chain, In-N-Out Burger immediately severed ties with its former supplier CVM upon the release of Animal Outlook's investigation findings, followed by national chains McDonald's and Costco. In February 2014, the facility was again shut down by the USDA for unsanitary conditions. =Quanah Cattle Company= In 2013, a Animal Outlook activist was arrested (although charges were eventually dropped) in Colorado for filming alleged cattle abuse at the Quanah Cattle Company and failing to report the abuse \\"in a timely manner.\\" Animal Outlook Executive Director Erica Meier stated that this is a \\"shoot-the-messenger strategy aimed at detracting attention away from the crimes of those who actually abused animals.\\"Taylor Radig Filmed Alleged Cattle Abuse At Ranch, But Got Arrested For Not Reporting It Immediately. The Huffington Post, 24 November 2013. =Pilgrim's Pride chicken factory farm= In 2014, a Animal Outlook investigation exposed chickens being buried alive at a North Carolina factory farm supplying Pilgrim's Corp. (formerly Pilgrim's Pride), the second largest chicken producer in the world and a supplier for Chick-Fil-A, Burger King, Wendy's and Walmart. CNN broke the shocking story. =Foster Farms turkey hatchery= In early 2015, a Animal Outlook investigator documented horrific treatment of baby birds - including mutilations, gassing and being ground up alive - inside a Foster Farms hatchery in Fresno, California. =Mountaire Farms= At a North Carolina chicken slaughterhouse owned by Mountaire Farms, Inc., the seventh largest chicken producer in the U.S, Animal Outlook exposed birds being violently thrown and punched, their feathers being ripped out, and sick or injured birds left in piles to die slowly. =Quality Pork Processors (Hormel)= In 2015, an Animal Outlook investigator uncovered conditions in a Minnesota facility that kills and processes animals for Hormel. This plant is one of the largest pig slaughterhouses in the U.S., and one of five plants enrolled in Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Based Inspection Models Project (HIMP), a pilot USDA program that allows for faster processing of animals with reduced government inspection. The Washington Post broke the story of the investigation, writing, \\"Months worth of footage have raised serious concerns about the conditions at one of the largest pork processors in the U.S., and started a government investigation.\\" In 2013, an Audit Report issued by the USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) underscored concerns that HIMP may pose food safety risks. Legal advocacy Animal Outlook's innovative Legal Advocacy Program has been working since 2004 to use the legal system to oppose the system injustices of factory farming. Using existing criminal law and civil litigation, the Program focuses on fighting large-scale animal cruelty on factory farms and works to protect consumers from manipulation and unfair practices by the animal agriculture industry. Because farmed animals are given almost no protection under the law, this challenging work is vitally important. The Legal Advocacy Program seeks enforcement of existing criminal laws against owners and employees of the facilities for the harming of animals, and develops legal analysis in order to bring landmark lawsuits and other legal actions. The Program also conducts outreach and education, providing attorneys, legal students, and the public with information about farmed animals and the law. * In 2005, egg producers dropped an \\"Animal Care Certified\\" label from their products after Animal Outlook filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for false advertising on the part of the egg companies. Animal Outlook said that the egg label implied that the care of the animals had met a certain standard of animal conditions, which the egg producers had not; the National Advertising Review Board agreed that the label was deceptive. The FTC complaint was dropped when the egg industry agreed to exchange the label in favor of one stating, \\"United Egg Producers Certified\\". * In 2011, dairy consumers, including members of Animal Outlook, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of consumers alleging that several dairy companies and trade groups‚Äîincluding Land O'Lakes, the National Milk Producers Federation, and Dairy Farmers of America‚Äîjoined as Cooperatives Working Together (CWT) in order to engage in a price fixing scheme that inflated the price of milk. This resulted, according to the complaint, in over $9.5 billion in illegally obtained profits and could impact the price of milk for years. * Animal Outlook joined organizations Animal Legal Defense Fund, Farm Sanctuary and Animal Protection and Rescue League, and individuals, in filing a lawsuit against the USDA for allowing the sale of foie gras, a diseased poultry product. The agency is required through the Poultry Products Inspection Act to condemn diseased poultry as adulterated. The force-feeding of ducks and geese to produce foie gras results in a condition known as hepatic lipidosis or \\"fatty liver disease,\\" in which the birds' livers swell up to ten times their normal size.

The middle volume concerns the surviving Frenchwomen's slow journey back to freedom after they were moved from Auschwitz to Ravensbr√ºck and ultimately turned over to the Swedish Red Cross, and is somewhat more linear. Technique Delbo's guiding principle was, as she regularly described it, Essayez de regarder. Essayez pour voir, or roughly translated when it occurs as a refrain in her work, \\"Try to look. Just try and see.\\" She knew that ordinary language could not begin to convey what she had experienced, and drew on her theatrical background and contemporary literary trends to produce a more postmodern text built around short vignettes, poems both titled and untitled and narrative fragments replete with repetition and sentence fragments that feel more like poetry. In the last volume, dealing with the survivors' efforts to reintegrate themselves into everyday French life, many sections read like oral histories told by individual survivors, not all of whom knew Delbo in camp. The end result has the effect of conveying the violence done to reason and orderly language by the horror of Auschwitz. \\"O You Who Know,\\" (\\"Vous qui saviez\\") a poem early in the trilogy, challenges the reader with the inadequacy of what they already understand: ::O you who know ::Could you know that hunger makes the eyes sparkle? ::While thirst makes them dim? ::You who know ::Could you know that you can see your mother dead ::Without shedding a tear? ::You who know ::Could you know how in the morning you crave death ::Only to fear it by evening? \\"Horror cannot be circumscribed,\\" she concludes, and throughout the trilogy she regularly expresses doubt as to whether she can truly tell the reader what it was like, whether anyone can. ::You don't believe what we say ::because ::if what we say were true ::we wouldn't be here to say it. ::we'd have to explain ::the inexplicable \\"I am not sure that what I wrote is true,\\" she wrote in the epigraph to the first volume, \\"I am certain that it is truthful.\\" Resolving those two statements makes reading Auschwitz and After an advanced reading experience that more are slowly discovering.

In March 2001, Haski was filming a documentary on Chinese Muslims. During his journey, he arrived in the extremely remote village of Zhangjiashu, in the northwestern region of Ningxia, and stayed for a few days in the village imam's modest hut. There, Haski and his team were treated well by the impoverished villagers. Facilities such as drinking water and education were very poor. As they were leaving, the mother of thirteen- year-old Ma Yan thrust her daughter's diaries into the arms of the foreigners , pleading them to help her. Back in Shanghai, the team were very touched by the words on the tattered pages, in which Ma Yan described her wishes to continue to attend school and help her family.Being desperately poor, the Ma family had to pull Ma Yan out of school as the fees were much too expensive for Ma Yan's family to afford. Haski later published the poignant autobiography, first in France. In the summer of 2002, a fund known as the Children of Ningxia was set up to send Ma Yan and children like her to school. Since then the diary has been published in seventeen languages and sold over 200,000 copies worldwide. Ma Yan is finishing her education and wishes to be a journalist. I want to study journalism at university, she said. Asked why, she pointed to Mr. Haski, whom she calls Uncle Han. Because Uncle Han and others traveled across the country and found poor children like us, she said. I'd like to be a journalist so I, too, can help poor children. Thanks to her, 250 other Chinese schoolchildren have also been put through the education system on the way to a better life. The basic necessities of life such as a fresh water well and agricultural fertilisers have also been provided to her village. References *Ma, Yan, and Pierre Haski (2005).

In the game, the player controls Mickey Mouse, who must navigate through various side-scrolling levels, each designed and based from classical Mickey Mouse cartoons. The game was later released on the PlayStation in 1996 as Mickey's Wild Adventure. Gameplay Mickey Mania is a platformer in which players control Mickey Mouse as he visits various locations based on his past cartoons, ranging from his debut in Steamboat Willie to the more recent The Prince and the Pauper. Mickey can attack enemies by either jumping on them or by using a limited supply of marbles, which are collected throughout the level. Mickey can take up to five hits, represented by the fingers he holds up on his hand, which can be replenished by collecting stars, whilst extra lives can be gained by finding Mickey hats. Levels offer a variety of challenges such as puzzles the player must solve, escaping from a rampaging moose and fleeing from a flaming staircase. The levels in the game are based from the following classic Mickey Mouse cartoons: * Steamboat Willie (1928) * The Mad Doctor (1933) * Moose Hunters (1937) * Lonesome Ghosts (1937) * Mickey and the Beanstalk (1947) ** The Band Concert (1935) (not included in the Super NES version) * The Prince and the Pauper (1990) Development Originally, Mickey Mania was planned to be released to coincide with Mickey's 65th birthday in 1993. However, as that would have only allowed for six months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped in favor of the more compelling concept of Mickey traveling back in time to his own original classic cartoons and subsequently recreating the events of the aforementioned shorts in the process. The game pays tribute to Mickey's early cartoon career. The success of Mickey Mania led to the development of a sequel which would later be canceled so that Traveller's Tales could instead focus on developing a game based on the then-upcoming film Toy Story. The game was the debut project of game designer David Jaffe. =Version differences= The Super NES version is missing the hidden Band Concert level, the staircase sequence in the Mad Doctor level, a few special effects, some of Pluto's appearances, and some level-ending sequences. It also adds loading time screens in between each area. The Sega CD and PlayStation versions extend the ending to the Mad Doctor level, showing that the Mad Doctor had regressed to a baby, and adds a sequence near the end of the Prince and the Pauper level wherein Mickey must find pencils to call upon the other Mickeys from the six main levels to attack Pete, as well as giving Mickey extensive dialogue relevant to situations throughout the game. The Genesis version lacks the hidden area near the end of the first level. The PlayStation version enhances the graphics (all sprites are remade, the staircase sequences are rendered in 3D, and in the Mad Doctor level, crates occasionally come from behind which Mickey has to dodge) and adds a sequence at the end of the Mickey and the Beanstalk level where Mickey must run away from Willie the Giant. Willie makes no appearance in any of the other game versions despite being mentioned in the manuals of all four versions. Both Sega CD and PlayStation versions utilize a Compact Disc Digital Audio-based soundtrack composed by Michael Giacchino.

They particularly applauded the visual style and the motif of playing inside old cartoons, commenting that \\"The blend of past and present is magical.\\" However, they criticized that the game is too easy and concluded that \\"If Mickey's not your thing, you won't appreciate this cart. But if you liked any of Mickey's other games, you won't miss with Mickey Mania. The same reviewer later covered the Sega CD version. He praised its improved graphics, additional voice samples, and new level, but again concluded that the game is too easy to appeal to anyone who isn't a Mickey Mouse fan. A different GamePro reviewer covered the SNES version, and in contrast found that the game's difficulty was too high for younger gamers. However, he praised the responsive controls and sharp graphics. Maximum gave the PlayStation version two out of five stars. They praised the graphical stylistics, attention to detail, and solid gameplay, but criticized that the action never builds in intensity or pays off, and the game makes no noticeable improvements over the earlier, last generation versions of the game. They nonetheless held it to be far better than the other 2D platformer then on the PlayStation, Johnny Bazookatone. Next Generation reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"There's just enough innovation here [...] to make it a must, and if you've got kids, I think it's the law.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Ingenious action like Mickey carefully mixing a potion while being attacked from every side, makes it hard to put down.\\"  References  External links * Category:1994 video games Category:Cancelled Windows games Category:Mickey Mouse video games Category:Disney video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Sega CD games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Epic/Sony Records games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Mickey Mania"},{"id":"3029993","text":"Kunstverein may refer to: * , art association, founded in 1986 in Aachen, Germany * Kunstverein Arnsberg, association for contemporary art in Arnsberg, Germany * Kunstverein Bremen, society which operates the Bremen Art Museum, Germany * Frankfurter Kunstverein, art museum in Frankfurt, Germany * , art association in Hanover, Germany * K√∂lnischer Kunstverein, former art association in Cologne, Germany that now refers to an art gallery of the same name * Kunstverein M√ºnchen, association for contemporary art founded in 1823 in M√ºnchen, Germany * Kunstverein Mannheim, association that operates the Kunsthalle Mannheim, Germany * Kunstverein N√ºrnberg, venue for contemporary art exhibitions in N√ºrnberg, Germany * Kunstverein Winterthur, art society that operates the Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland *W√ºrttembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart, one of the biggest and oldest art societies in Germany located in Stuttgart *Kunsthalle Z√ºrich, association for contemporary art exhibition in Z√ºrich, Switzerland See also * Kunstmuseum (disambiguation) ","title":"Kunstverein"},{"id":"3029997","text":"Kunstmuseum is literally translated into English as \\"museum of the arts\\".

The reaction is named after its co-discoverer, John E. McMurry. The McMurry reaction originally involved the use of a mixture TiCl3 and LiAlH4, which produces the active reagent(s). Related species have been developed involving the combination of TiCl3 or TiCl4 with various other reducing agents, including potassium, zinc, and magnesium.Ian C. Richards \\"Titanium(IV) Chloride‚ÄìZinc\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley, London, 2001. . Article Online Posting Date: April 15, 2001Martin G. Banwell, \\"Titanium(III) Chloride‚ÄìLithium Aluminum Hydride\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis John Wiley, London, 2001. . Article Online Posting Date: April 15, 2001 This reaction is related to the Pinacol coupling reaction which also proceeds by reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds. Reaction mechanism This reductive coupling can be viewed as involving two steps. First is the formation of a pinacolate (1,2-diolate) complex, a step which is equivalent to the pinacol coupling reaction. The second step is the deoxygenation of the pinacolate which yields the alkene, this second step exploits the oxophilicity of titanium. A proposed mechanism when TiCl4 and Zn(Cu) are used for the coupling of benzophenone, as proposed in a reference. Note that the mechanism may vary when different conditions are used. Several mechanisms have been discussed for this reaction. Low-valent titanium species induce coupling of the carbonyls by single electron transfer to the carbonyl groups. The required low-valent titanium species are generated via reduction, usually with zinc powder. This reaction is often performed in THF because it solubilizes intermediate complexes, facilitates the electron transfer steps, and is not reduced under the reaction conditions. The nature of low-valent titanium species formed is varied as the products formed by reduction of the precursor titanium halide complex will naturally depend upon both the solvent (most commonly THF or DME) and the reducing agent employed: typically, lithium aluminum hydride,zinc-copper couple, zinc dust, magnesium-mercury amalgam, magnesium, or alkali metals. Bogdanovic and Bolte identified the nature and mode of action of the active species in some classical McMurry systems, and an overview of proposed reaction mechanisms has been published. It is of note that titanium dioxide is not generally a product of the coupling reaction. Although it is true that titanium dioxide is usually the eventual fate of titanium used in these reactions, it is generally formed upon the aqueous workup of the reaction mixture. Background and scope The original publication by Mukaiyama demonstrated reductive coupling of ketones using reduced titanium reagents.Mukaiyama, T.; Sato, T.; Hanna, \\"Reductive Coupling of Carbonyl Compounds to Pinacols and Olefins by Using TiCl4 and Zn\\" Chem. Lett. 1973, 1041. McMurry and Fleming coupled retinal to give carotene using a mixture of titanium trichloride and lithium aluminium hydride. Other symmetrical alkenes were prepared similarly, e.g. from dihydrocivetone, adamantanone and benzophenone (the latter yielding tetraphenylethylene). A McMurry reaction using titanium tetrachloride and zinc is employed in the synthesis of a first- generation molecular motor. :McMurry coupling to a molecular motor In another example, the Nicolaou's total synthesis of Taxol uses this reaction, although coupling stops with the formation of a cis-diol, rather than an olefin. Optimized procedures employ the dimethoxyethane complex of TiCl3 in combination with the Zn(Cu).

In September 2002 they were publicly cited by the White House as evidence that Iraq was actively pursuing an atomic weapon. Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many questioned the validity of the claim. After the invasion, the Iraq Survey Group determined that the best explanation for the tubes' use was to produce conventional 81-mm rockets; no evidence was found of a program to design or develop an 81-mm aluminum rotor uranium centrifuge. The order and shipment In 2000, Iraq ordered, via a company in Jordan, 60,000 high- strength aluminum tubes manufactured from 7075-T6 aluminum with an outer diameter of 81 mm, and an inner diameter of 74.4 mm, a wall thickness of 3.3 mm and a length of 900 mm, to be manufactured in China. These tubes were classified as controlled items by the United Nations and Iraq was not permitted to import them.Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq's Nuclear Program (2003) The order was placed with an Australian company, International Aluminum Supply (IAS), which was associated with Kam Kiu Propriety Limited, a subsidiary of the Chinese company that would do the manufacturing. Concerned that the tubes might be related to Iraqi efforts to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program, Garry Cordukes, the director of the company, contacted the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS). In turn, ASIS notified US intelligence services. ASIS also asked Cordukes to obtain a sample of the tubes for examination. He obtained one and handed it over to the ASIS. On May 23, 2001, a container load of about 3,000 aluminum tubes left the factory in southern China. It traveled on a barge to Hong Kong. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was watching its progress, as was the ASIS. In July 2001, the tubes were seized in Jordan by the Jordanian secret police and the CIA, according to a CIA presentation later that year.\\"Spinning the Tubes\\", Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2003 Iraq also attempted to acquire aluminum tubes of the same type in late 2002 and early 2003, with negotiations still going on with a Syrian company when the 2003 Invasion of Iraq began.Iraq Survey Group Final Report  Claims made to other governments In late 2001, a small group of agents from the CIA went to Canada, Britain and Australia, to present information to the intelligence agencies and politicians of those countries. The CIA agents said the tubes were destined to become the rotors in a gas centrifuge program to create enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. The CIA agents acknowledged there was another possible use for the tubes - as artillery rocket casings, but argued that the specifications sought by Iraq were far greater than they would need for rockets. September 2002 claims On September 8, 2002, Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller published a story in the New York Times titled \\"U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts\\": > In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially > designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as > components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.

The Washington Times reported in July > that Iraq sought to acquire stainless steel for centrifuges on one occasion. > Officials say that the material sought was special aluminum tubes and that > Iraq sought to acquire it over 14 months. A substantial part of the story was based on deliberate leaking of classified information to the Times reporters by Scooter Libby, the chief of staff of Vice President Dick Cheney.\\"'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Nov. 1st\\", NBC News, November 2, 2005 The story was later criticized by the New York Times ombudsman for insufficient credibility and one-sidedness. The same day the article appeared in the Times, top officials in the Bush administration appeared on Sunday morning talk shows: *Cheney, on NBC's Meet the Press, accused Iraq of moving aggressively to develop nuclear weapons over the past 14 months, saying that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was now \\"trying, through his illicit procurement network, to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to enrich uranium -- specifically, aluminum tubes.\\"\\"Top Bush officials push case against Saddam\\" , CNN.com, September 8, 2002 *Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke on Fox News Sunday, saying \\"And as we saw in reporting just this morning, he is still trying to acquire, for example, some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability.\\"\\"Transcript: Colin Powell on Fox News Sunday, Sunday, September 08, 2002\\" *National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer that the tubes \\"are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs\\" and \\"we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\\" *Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appeared on CBS' Face the Nation. *Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers appeared on ABC's This Week. Internal U.S. Intelligence evaluations =Central Intelligence Agency= In July 2002, in the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the CIA reported to Congress that \\"Iraq's efforts to procure tens of thousands of proscribed high-strength aluminum tubes are of significant concern. All intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons and that these tubes could be used in a centrifuge enrichment program. Most intelligence specialists assess this to be the intended use, but some believe that these tubes are probably intended for conventional weapons programs.\\"Jun 2002 ODCI (CIA) Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions In January 2003, the language in the CIA's report to Congress was similar, but provided a bit more detail about conventional weapons: \\"Iraq's efforts to procure tens of thousands of proscribed high- strength aluminum tubes were of significant concern. All intelligence experts agreed that Iraq remained intent on acquiring nuclear weapons and that these tubes, if modified, could be used in a centrifuge enrichment program.

According to Corn, one of her actions was a trip to Jordan \\"to work with Jordanian intelligence officials who had intercepted a shipment of aluminum tubes heading to Iraq that CIA analysts were claiming--wrongly--were for a nuclear weapons program. (The analysts rolled over the government's top nuclear experts, who had concluded the tubes were not destined for a nuclear program.)\\". = Department of Energy= On September 20, 2002, The United Press International reported that: > ... doubts about the quality of some of the evidence that the United States > is using to make its case that Iraq is trying to build a nuclear bomb > emerged Thursday. While National Security Adviser Condi Rice stated on > September 8 that imported aluminum tubes 'are only really suited for nuclear > weapons programs, centrifuge programs' a growing number of experts say that > the administration has not presented convincing evidence that the tubes were > intended for use in uranium enrichment rather than for artillery rocket > tubes or other uses. Former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright said he > found significant disagreement among scientists within the Department of > Energy and other agencies about the certainty of the evidence. In September 2006, Representative Heather Wilson, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, disclosed that she had learned, in 2002, that the Department of Energy disputed whether those tubes could be used in the centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for bomb fuel. Wilson said that she had questioned CIA officials about the aluminum tubes at classified briefings for members of Congress, prior to the October 11, 2002, vote in Congress to authorize force against Iraq. Wilson told The Albuquerque Tribune that she did not publicly disclose the Energy Department's doubts about the aluminum tubes before Congress voted because the information was classified.\\"Wilson: I questioned Iraq evidence: Congresswoman voted for war despite disputes of CIA's proof\\" , Albuquerque Tribune, September 11, 2006 = October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate = In early October 2002, President Bush was given a one-page summary report of a National Intelligence Estimate on the issue of whether Saddam's procurement of high-strength aluminum tubes was for the purpose of developing a nuclear weapon (the NIE was declassified on July 18, 2003, and presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Key Judgments: Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction). The report stated that the Department of Energy and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research believed that the tubes were \\"intended for conventional weapons,\\" while other intelligence agencies, including some at the CIA, believed that the tubes were intended for nuclear enrichment. French intelligence assessments A June 4, 2003, article in the Financial Times reported that \\"French intelligence had seized a separate shipment of tubes to the US, and tested their tolerance by spinning them to 98,000 revolutions per minute, concluding they were too sophisticated to have alternative uses.\\" The Times also reported that Secretary of State Colin Powell was denied permission by French political authorities from using this information in his February 5, 2003, speech before the U.N. Security Council. In a speech before the New America Foundation American Strategy Program Policy Forum on October 19, 2005, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson (Ret.), a former Chief of Staff for the State Department from 2002‚Äì2005, commented on this. According to Wilkerson, \\"The French came in the middle of my deliberations at the CIA and said, we have just spun aluminum tubes, and by God, we did it to this RPM, et cetera, et cetera, and it was all, you know, proof positive that the aluminum tubes were not for mortar casings or artillery casings, they were for centrifuges. Otherwise, why would you have such exquisite instruments? We were wrong. We were wrong.\\"  President Bush's State of the Union address  In his January 28, 2003, State of the Union address, Bush stated: \\"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.\\" Colin Powell at the UN On February 5, 2003, Colin Powell spoke to the United Nations Security Council: > Since 1998, [Saddam's] efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been > focused on acquiring the third and last component, sufficient fissile > material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he > needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined > to get his hands on a nuclear bomb. He is so determined that he has made > repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from > 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are > controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used > as centrifuges for enriching uranium. By now, just about everyone has heard > of these tubes, and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There > is controversy about what these tubes are for.

Let > me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the > experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be > adapted for centrifuge use. Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any > purpose. They are banned for Iraq. I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but > just as an old Army trooper, I can tell you a couple of things: First, it > strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance > that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets.

Second, we actually have examined tubes from several > different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached > Baghdad.

Why would > they continue refining the specifications, go to all that trouble for > something that, if it were a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when > it went off?  Summer 2003 concerns  In the summer of 2003, an informal review of classified government records by Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley concluded that Bush had been directly and repeatedly apprised of the deep rift within the intelligence community over whether Iraq wanted the high- strength aluminum tubes for a nuclear weapons program or for conventional weapons. According to the March 30, 2006, National Journal article that reported on this review, Hadley was most concerned about the October 2002 one- page summary of a National Intelligence Estimate prepared specifically for President Bush (see section above). The review by Hadley was to be part of a damage-control effort launched after former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV alleged that Bush's claims regarding uranium purchases were not true. After the review was completed, Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political adviser, allegedly cautioned other White House aides that Bush's 2004 re-election prospects would be severely damaged if it was publicly disclosed that he had been personally warned that a key rationale for going to war had been challenged within the administration. Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence The report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq discussed the controversy. Part III, Intelligence Community Analysis of Iraq's Nuclear Program, states: =Tube specifications= > In 2001, the [US intelligence community] became aware that Iraq was > attempting to procure 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes manufactured from > 7075-T6 aluminum, with an outer diameter of 81 mm, and inner diameter of > 74.4 mm, a wall thickness of 3.3 mm and a length of 900 mm. The tubes were > to be anodized using chromic acid and were to be shipped, wrapped in wax > paper and separated from each other. Seven-thousand series aluminum alloy is > extremely hard and strong and when formed into a tube of more than 75 mm in > diameter, is a controlled item under the Nuclear Suppliers Group and Annex > I11 of UNSCR 687 and 707 which Iraq is prohibited from importing because it > could have nuclear applications. [page 5] =Department of Energy= > Based on the reported specifications, the tubes could be used to manufacture > gas centrifuge rotor cylinders for uranium enrichment.

He was described by his partisans as the last true Frisian freedom fighter, although some decried his seemingly insatiable appetite for violence. Biography and history Balthasar Oomkens von Esens was the son of Hero Oomkens von Esens, Lord of Harlingerland and Armgard Countess of Oldenburg. The Oomkens family were established in East Frisia (now part of Niedersachsen in Germany) and in the Frisian Oldambt, in the Groninger Ommelanden (now part of Groningen in the Netherlands). The family prided itself on its direct descent from Radbod, King of the Frisians. Balthasar led a successful resistance of the old Frisian aristocracy against the rise of the Cirksena family, which attempted to unite East Frisia under its rule from the late fifteenth century. The Cirksenas supported Protestantism whilst both Balthasar and his father remained loyal to the Catholic Church. Allied to his close relations the Counts of Oldenburg and the Duke of Gelderland/Gelre, Balthasar Oomkens von Esens resisted the doubtful political power-grabbing attempted by the Cirksenas (which included a forged imperial document relating to the lordship of Harlingerland) and also championed the interests of the Catholic Church against the Reformation-minded allies of the Cirksenas. As a result of his resistance, Harlingerland remained a free county under its own jurisdiction until it came through inheritance to Frederick the Great in 1744. Balthasar Oomkens von Esens was a popular figure among the Frisian people and has remained so. He is generally remembered today as \\"Junker Balthasar\\" and in Esens (whose city rights he granted in 1527) there is a yearly festival in his honour. Legends There is a legend associated with Balthasar Oomkens von Esens which still finds expression in the city's coat of arms. One year, the city was besieged by Bremen, and amongst the people trapped behind the city walls there was an itinerant musician and his performing bear. As the siege dragged on, provisions ran out and the famished bear escaped. Breaking free of his chains, the bear climbed up one of the defensive towers, where his enraged roars attracted the attention of the besiegers. In his confusion, the bear broke some of the stones from the ancient walls and hurled them at the enemy. The besiegers concluded that if the people of Esens had enough food to feed a bear, they must have plenty to feed themselves and as the spectacle of the roaring bear unsettled them, they called off the siege and returned to Bremen. In gratitude, the people of Esens immortalised the bear in their city's coat of arms (later also incorporated into the arms of East Frisia and of Wittmund (district)). Quotations Balthasar Oomkens von Esens' motto was inscribed on a window-pane in Esens castle: *\\"Wer das wol doht, der ist hochgeboren; Sonder doghede ist de adel verloren.\\" (Who serves the common weal is nobly born; Without right actions, nobility is forlorn.\\") Note: Alternative spellings/versions of his name are common, e.g.: Baltzer, Baldassar, etc. Footnotes  References  *Ubbo Emmius, Rerum Frisicarum Historia, Leiden 1616 *H.

It was released for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Atari ST. It also had two different games of the same name for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name. NES version In this side- scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In most levels, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face. Between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the similar to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. Reception The Spectrum version was well received critically, with Crash magazine awarding 82%, and Sinclair User 78%. In a 1991 review, Your Sinclair gave the Spectrum version 85%, while a 1993 review by another Your Sinclair critic gave Darkman's budget re-release 22%.

Catholic Hierarchy data page Life He was born in Chrlice in what is now the Czech Republic. He was ordained a priest on 29 June 1945 in the Diocese of Brno. He was arrested by the Czech secret police and was in prison from 1950 to 1964. He was secretly ordained a bishop by Bishop Jan Blaha, under appeal to pontifical privileges granted from 1951 to 1989 to bishops in communist countries, on 29 October 1967, and was given the assignment to pastor the clandestine or so-called underground church in Communist Czechoslovakia.Declaration On Bishops and Priests Ordained Secretly in the Czech Republic, issued on 11 February 2000 by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, ¬ß4. He died from complications of an accident in which his skin was badly burned. It was reported in 1992 that in 1978 the \\"Vatican ordered Father Dav√≠dek to cease performing the duties of a bishop.\\" Irregular ordinations Interest in Dav√≠dek greatly increased when it was disclosed after his death that, by the account of Ludmila Javorov√° and others, he had administered the sacrament of holy orders to Javorova and perhaps several other women. Bishop Blaha declared any such ordinations would have been invalid. Pope John Paul II, in his 1994 apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis, wrote that \\"In order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance ... I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.\\" Apostolic Letter of Pope John Paul II: Ordinatio Sacerdotalis Other priestly ordinations, even of men, during the period of persecution were possibly invalid, illicit, or irregular, according to church teaching. The irregular situation of priests in the Czech Republic in active ministry, but the validity of whose ordination was in doubt, was largely resolved by 2000 through discussions with the Vatican. On February 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the FaithDeclaration On Bishops and Priests Ordained Secretly in the Czech Republic issued a declaration on the subject, announcing (a) that with regard to celibate priests, a great part (some 50 in all) had accepted the decision of the Pope that they should be conditionally re-ordained, and (b) that a further 22 priests who were married should also be conditionally re-ordained and transferred to the Byzantine-Slav rite as members, for all purposes, of the exarchate of the Czech Republic.Married priests are permitted in the Byzantine rites; see Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Presbyterorum Ordinis, Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests, n.16. There remained the status of some of the bishops and priests secretly ordained who had not accepted the norms (for conditional re-ordination) approved by the Pope, specifically because they were convinced they had already been validly ordained. While the Vatican confirmed that \\"conditional re-ordination\\" did not exclude the possibility that the men had previously been validly ordained, it held to the view that the doubts over validity were genuine: > \\"In reality, based on research done on each case, priestly ordination was > not always conferred in a valid manner; perhaps in some cases it may have > been, but there remained serious doubts about this, especially in the case > of ordinations carried out by Bishop Felix Maria Davidek.\\"Declaration On > Bishops and Priests Ordained Secretly in the Czech Republic, ¬ß3 References Category:1921 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Czech Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Czech poets Category:Male poets Category:Czech male writers Category:Czech theologians Category:20th-century poets Category:Women's ordination activists Category:Ordination of women and the Catholic Church Category:20th-century male writers ","title":"Felix Maria Dav√≠dek"},{"id":"3030110","text":"Vladimir Narbut Vladimir Ivanovich Narbut (; ) (1888-1938) was a Russian poet of Ukrainian descent, and a member of the Acmeist group. He was also brother to Ukrainian artist and graphic designer Georgy Narbut. Biography Vladimir Ivanovich Narbut was born on his family's estate at Narbutovka, near the town of Hlukhiv in the Chernigov Governorate of the Russian Empire (now part of the Sumy Oblast of Ukraine). His family had origins of ancient Lithuanian nobility. In 1906, Narbut and his brother Georgii (the painter and graphic designer Georgii Ivanovich Narbut) moved to Saint Petersburg where Vladimir studied mathematics and Oriental languages. Narbut's poems first appeared in print in 1908, and two years later he published his debut collection of verse Stikhi. God tvorchestva pervy ('Poems. Year One of Creative Work'). His second collection, Alliluia (\\"Hallelujah,\\" 1912)‚Äîfilled with \\"grotesque and vivid imagery\\" according to the Handbook of Russian Literature‚Äîsatirized the landed gentry,Victor Teras, Handbook of Russian Literature, 292. and copies were seized by the police as pornographic. To avoid the ensuing scandal and a court trial, Narbut spent the next five months on an ethnographic expedition to Ethiopia and Somalia. He returned to Russia after the amnesty declared on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty in March 1913. On his return Narbut became the publisher and editor of the magazine Novy Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh until he had to give it up for financial reasons. After the February Revolution broke out in 1917, Narbut joined the Bolsheviks. One night early in 1918, armed men broke into the Narbut family home and killed his brother Sergei. Narbut himself was wounded and had to have his left hand amputated. During the Russian Civil War, Narbut published literary magazines in Voronezh and Kiev. He was arrested by the White Guards in Rostov-on-Don and imprisoned until being released by the Red Army. In the 1920s, he edited the magazines Lava and Oblava in Odessa and issued further collections of his own verse, including Aleksandra Pavlovna (1922), the last to appear in his lifetime. In 1928 he was accused of not telling the truth about his imprisonment by the Whites and was expelled from the Communist Party. He began writing lyrics again in the 1930s and another collection, Spiral, was due to be published when he was arrested on October 26, 1936, and accused of belonging to subversive \\"Ukrainian nationalist\\" group. He sentenced to five years in the gulag, and was incarcerated in prison camps near Vladivostok and Magadan. The circumstances of his death and its date are uncertain; the registered date of 1944 is in all likelihood invented. He was likely either summarily shot in 1938, or drowned with a group of prisoners in sealed barge in the Arctic Ocean (according to Nadezhda Mandelshtam). A translation of Narbut's poem \\"Portrait\\" appears in the anthology Modern Russian Poetry, ed. Vladimir Markov and Merrill Sparks (Bobbs Merrill, 1967).

This break with convention divided critical response to the game. The game was developed on a budget of two million dollars. The video footage was filmed over two weeks. When asked if it was difficult to call up his usual energy when working with a film crew instead of a real game-day situation, Mike Ditka said, \\"I've been called a lot of things, and being called 'an actor' has been one of them. It's not that hard to do, really.\\" Footage from the game was used in the film Game Over. After Digital Pictures bankruptcy, the rights to several of their games were purchased by a consortium that included visual effects company Flash Film Works. In December 2016, Quarterback Attack was remastered from the original source video and released as an app for Google Play and iTunes. Reception The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly both praised the unique game concept and said that despite being FMV-based, the game is actually fun to play. A Next Generation critic agreed: \\"It's tempting to write this game off as another novelty FMV product, but when given the proper attention, this one might just surprise even the most die-hard of sports fans.\\" He elaborated that the fast pace and smooth transitions between video clips enhance the feeling of being in a real football game. His one criticism was that the video quality is subpar by Saturn standards. Greasy Gus of GamePro also felt the game simulated the quarterback experience with a surprising amount of realism and interactivity, noting that \\"You do everything a real QB does: call the play and the cadence, study the defense at the line and adjust with audibles if necessary, dodge the rush, find your open man, and get your crosshair on him for a clean pass. You even have the option of eating the ball Steve Young- style and scrambling for some yards yourself.\\" He found the graphics and sounds were both sufficient though not without problems, but concluded that many gamers would miss the comprehensive modes and options typical of football video games. Reviewing the 3DO version for the same mag, Coach Kyle was even less forgiving of the game's novel concept; though he praised the video quality and humorous taunts, he focused most of his review lambasting the lack of football game conventions such as multiplayer modes, licensing, and the ability to control an entire team.

It was discovered during the Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey on 24 September 1960, by astronomers Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory in California. The C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 17.5 hours. It was named for the optician Bernhard Schmidt.  Orbit and classification  Schmidt is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. As it is located in the dynamical region of the Vesta family, the asteroid is potentially a Vestian interloper due to its completely different spectral type. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,421 days; semi-major axis of 2.47 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as at the Lowell Observatory in January 1931, more than 29 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar Observatory. = Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey = The survey designation \\"P-L\\" stands for \\"Palomar‚ÄìLeiden\\", named after the Palomar and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroid discoveries.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Baltic German optician and astronomer Bernhard Schmidt (1879‚Äì1935), who invented the Schmidt camera, a telescope design with a spherical primary mirror and an aspherical correcting lens, providing a wide field of view with little optical aberrations. Proposed by Paul Herget, the asteroid's official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 August 1970 ().  Physical characteristics  Schmidt is a common carbonaceous C-type asteroid as determined during the first phase of the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey. = Rotation period and poles = In September 1983, a rotational lightcurve of Schmidt was obtained from photometric observations by Richard Binzel. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.36 magnitude (). A modeled lightcurve using photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database was published in 2016. It gave a concurring period of hours, as well as two spin axes at (69.0¬∞, ‚àí62.0¬∞) and (261.0¬∞, ‚àí53.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Schmidt measures between 17.00 and 20.78 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.042 and 0.0603. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0603 and a diameter of 17.28 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.48.

Gmoch begun playing for Znicz Pruszk√≥w, to move on for a successful career in Legia Warsaw. With Legia, he won the Polish Cup twice (in 1964 and 1966) and contributed to the beginning of the successful 1968‚Äì69 season. He also became a player for the national Team of Poland (29 caps). Following a major injury in a friendly match, Gmoch began a coaching career, starting in Legia Warsaw in 1969‚Äì71. Having been offered the assistant's job at Kazimierz G√≥rski, he lasted from 1971‚Äì74. Moved to U.S. to follow his scientific career (1975‚Äì6). He returned to qualify the National Team to 1978 Mundial in Argentina (fifth place). He later moved to Norway in 1979 and Greece until 2003 where he became one of the most successful and recognised coaches. In Norway, he became Skeid Fotball manager and then he went to Greece and worked first as a manager of PAS Giannina, Apollon Athens, Larisa, In 1983, he did his big step as a manager and became trainer of Panathinaikos. In his first season as Panathinaikos manager, his team won the Double and the following season, his team for second time in their history, reached the Semi finals of European Champions Cup, where they were eliminated by Liverpool. For the season 1985‚Äì86, he became coach of another great Greek club, AEK and the following season he became again trainer of Larisa and in 1988, his team won for first and only time the Greek Championship. After Larisa, he worked as a manager for Olympiacos and Aris Thessaloniki in 1991 he went to Cyprus to become APOEL trainer, where his team won the championship and he remained there until the middle of the season 1992‚Äì93.

The most well known example of this class of compound is Lawesson's reagent. Other examples of this class of compound have been made; many inorganic chemists are now using FcPS (Fc = ferrocene) as a starting material in reactions investigating the general chemistry of the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides, one reaction for this is that the FcPS compound and all its derivatives are red which make column chromatography of the products more easy. Also the ferrocenyl groups provide an electrochemical handle which provide another means of investigating the properties of the products. Examples While several different routes to the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides exist the most commonly used is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an arene with PS. An alternative reaction is the reaction of a thiol with PS to form a substance like the Davy reagent. The Davy reagent is identical to Lawesson's reagent except in place of the para-methoxyphenyl groups it has aryl sulfide groups. While the Davy reagent is more soluble than the Lawesson's reagent it is likely that the very vile nature of the thiol starting material is likely to make the synthesis of this compound not worth the trouble. In both the patent and academic chemical literature are examples of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with higher solubilities. These highly soluble versions of Lawesson's reagent are created by the reaction of PS with aryl ethers which are different from anisole. For instance butoxybenzene and 2-tert-butylanisole have both been reacted to form more soluble thionation reagents of the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide class. The general structure of a 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide and the reversible generation of the dithiophosphine ylides An important subclass of these compounds are the naphthalen-1,8-diyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides; these are intellectually interesting because the two dithiophosphine ylides are fixed together in space by the rigid naphthalene unit. The reactivity of these compounds is very different from that of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides. Reactions The dithiophosphine ylides are normally attacked at the phosphorus atom by a nucleophile, for instance the reaction of an alkoxide, phenolate, alcohol or phenol with a 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide can form a new compound with a phosphorus-oxygen bond. Such a reaction has been used in the formation of metal binding agents and in the synthesis of insecticides. The reaction of a 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide with either a nucleophile or an electrophile The reaction of an electrophile with 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides is less common, but the reaction of an alkyl halide with a 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide forms a new compound with a sulfur-carbon bond and a phosphorus-halide bond. Such a compound could act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in insects, but in order to make a better insecticide it would be best to convert the halide to another leaving group which would form a less water sensitive product. For instance the reaction of para-nitrophenolate would form a compound similar to parathion. Lawesson's reagent has been used as a starting material for a herbicide by reaction with a 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydroxy propane. This formed a compound which could be used to kill plants. This reaction of a 1,2-diol with lawesson's reagent results in a symmetric breaking of the PS ring, both halves of the lawesson's reagent end up being converted to the same product. A different type of ring breaking reaction can occur when LR is reacted with a metal compounds such as a platinum dichloride bis-phosphine complex, in this case one molecule of MeOCHP(S)Cl is formed as a side product to the platinum complex ([Pt(SP(S)CHOMe)(PR)]). Lawesson's reagent can be used as a dehydrating reagent, for example it has been used to convert a Œ≤-aminoamide into an imidazoline. Another useful reaction of LR is the conversion of a 1,4-diketone into a thiophene ring, this reaction can be done with PS but a much higher temperature would be required to make it work with PS. It was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six-membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings. It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product. One of the products of the reaction of FcPS with dimethyl cyanamide In addition small traces of other compounds are also formed in the reaction. It is unlikely that the ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) {or its isomer} would act as a plant protection agent, but (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) compounds can act as nerve poisons in insects. These compounds bearing terminal sulfur atoms on the phosphorus atom are much less toxic than the compounds (such as sarin, VX and tetraethyl pyrophosphate) which have an oxygen in place of this terminal sulfur. This is because the P=S compound is not active as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in either mammals or insects, in mammals the animals metabolism tends to remove lipophilic side groups from the phosphorus atom while an insect tends to oxidise the compound so removing the terminal sulfur and replacing it with a terminal oxygen which causes the compound to be more able to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The structure of the PSC compound The dithiophosphine ylides of LR and related compounds can react with strained alkenes, for example the bicyclic norbornadiene reacts with FcPS to form a compound with a PSC ring. Unlike small rings containing only first row elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen the small rings containing more heavy elements such as sulfur and selenium are more stable with regards to ring opening. Hence, the rings such as PSC are much more stable than things like epoxides. A selenium version of this ring type has been made, one notable example has been named Woollins' reagent and is PhPSe, this is made by the reaction of (PhP) with selenium metal. The solubility of this compound is very low but the group of Prof John Derek Woollins have published some reactions of this compound. For instance the reaction of Woollins' reagent (WR) with a dialkyl cyanamide has been found to form a bicyclic PCNSe system.

Written by guitarist Pete Townshend, it was the only song from the album to be released as a single. It remains the Who's biggest hit single in the US and, after debuting on the Hot 100 at number 72 on 14 October 1967, their only one to reach the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, at number 9 on 25 November ‚Äì 2 December 1967. Background Recorded in several separate sessions in studios across two continents, the recording of \\"I Can See for Miles\\" exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated studio techniques of rock bands in the late 1960s, such as those used for the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The backing tracks were recorded at CBS Studios in London, the vocals and overdubbing were performed at Talentmasters Studios in New York, and the single was mixed and mastered at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles. The initial UK mono pressing (Track Records) and the US Decca single has an overdubbed second bass line mixed upfront, whilst the drums are mixed slightly lower. It reached number 10 in the UK and number 9 in the US. Though these figures would seem successful to most bands, Townshend was disappointed. He had written the song in 1966 but had held it back as an \\"ace in the hole\\", believing it would be The Who's first number-one single. He is quoted as saying, \\"To me it was the ultimate Who record, yet it didn't sell. I spat on the British record buyer.\\" The song may have inspired the Beatles' \\"Helter Skelter\\". Paul McCartney recalls writing \\"Helter Skelter\\" after reading a review of The Who Sell Out in which the critic claimed that \\"I Can See for Miles\\" was the \\"heaviest\\" song he had ever heard. McCartney had not heard the song but wrote: \\"Helter Skelter\\" in an attempt to make an even \\"heavier\\" song than the one praised in the review, \\"to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera\\". \\"I Can See for Miles\\" was rarely performed live by the Who during the Keith Moon era; the complex vocal harmonies were difficult to replicate on stage, as was the percussion style found on the original recording. The song was performed on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in September 1967, but it was mimed. It was performed more regularly beginning in 1979 when Kenney Jones became the band's drummer, albeit in a much more straightforward rhythm. It was also played at nearly every show of the group's 1989 tour with Simon Phillips on drums and has been performed a handful of times with current drummer Zak Starkey. Roger Daltrey has played this song with his band No Plan B since 2009. It is a regular encore for his Tommy show. The 1979 compilation/soundtrack album The Kids Are Alright has a 2:45 abridged alternate mix of this song, as heard in the September 1967 mimed performance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The 1984 compilation album The Singles on both LP and CD releases has the 4:02 initial UK mono single version with the overdubbed second bass line mix. Critical reception The song is ranked number 40 on Dave Marsh's \\"The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made\\",The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made number 37 on NME's \\"The Top 100 Singles of All-Time\\", number 162 on Pitchfork Media's \\"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\\", and number 258 on Rolling Stone magazine's \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". Writing on AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called \\"I Can See for Miles\\" \\"one of the greatest Who songs\\", adding that it also features \\"one of Keith Moon's greatest performances\\" and \\"one of the best drum parts ever on a rock record\\".

The harbour forms an area of saltmarsh and shallow lagoons. It is not an estuary, as no major streams enter the harbour with the only freshwater inflow a few small streams draining surrounding fields. History In earlier times Pagham Harbour was a working harbour with three ports. One port was situated at the western end, of the harbour near Sidlesham Mill, and was known as Wardur. The port of Charlton was at the entrance to the harbour and the third was on the Pagham side of the harbour and was known as the Port of Wythering (Wyderinges).. The port of Wardur was part of 'New Haven' a development in the Middle Ages. The Port of Wythering was overrun by the sea in the 13th century and the whole harbour eventually silted up and ceased to be navigable, except for small craft. An attempt was made to drain the harbour for farming in c. 1873 with an embankment constructed across the edge of the lagoon to hold back the sea; this failed during a storm in December 1910 and was not reconstructed. At present the entrance to the sea is 50 metres wide.

The design process is inherently a knowledge-intensive activity, so a great deal of the emphasis for KBE is on the use of knowledge-based technology to support computer-aided design (CAD) however knowledge-based techniques (e.g. knowledge management) can be applied to the entire product lifecycle. The CAD domain has always been an early adopter of software-engineering techniques used in knowledge-based systems, such as object-orientation and rules. Knowledge-based engineering integrates these technologies with CAD and other traditional engineering software tools. Benefits of KBE include improved collaboration of the design team due to knowledge management, improved re-use of design artifacts, and automation of major parts of the product lifecycle. Overview KBE is essentially engineering on the basis of knowledge models. A knowledge model uses knowledge representation to represent the artifacts of the design process (as well as the process itself) rather than or in addition to conventional programming and database techniques. The advantages to using knowledge representation to model industrial engineering tasks and artifacts are: * Improved integration. In traditional CAD and industrial systems each application often has its own slightly different model. Having a standardized knowledge model makes integration easier across different systems and applications. * More re-use. A knowledge model facilitates storing and tagging design artifacts so that they can easily be found again and re-used. Also, knowledge models are themselves more re-usable by virtue of using formalism such as IS-A relations (classes and subclasses in the object-oriented paradigm). With subclassing it can be very easy to create new types of artifacts and processes by starting with an existing class and adding a new subclass that inherits all the default properties and behaviors of its parents and then can be adapted as needed. * Better maintenance. Class hierarchies not only facilitate re-use they also facilitate maintenance of systems. By having one definition of a class that is shared by multiple systems, issues of change control and consistency are greatly simplified. * More automation. Expert system rules can capture and automate decision making that is left to human experts with most conventional systems. KBE can have a wide scope that covers the full range of activities related to Product Lifecycle Management and Multidisciplinary design optimization. KBE's scope includes design, analysis (computer-aided engineering ‚Äì CAE), manufacturing, and support. In this inclusive role, KBE has to cover a large multi-disciplinary role related to many computer-aided technologies (CAx). There are two primary ways that KBE can be implemented: # Build knowledge models from the ground up using knowledge-based technology # Layer knowledge-based technology on top of existing CAD, simulation, and other engineering applications An early example of the first approach was the Simkit tool developed by Intellicorp in the 1980s. Simkit was developed on top of Intellicorp's Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE). KEE was a very powerful knowledge-based systems development environment. KEE started on Lisp and added frames, objects, and rules, as well as powerful additional tools, such as hypothetical reasoning and truth maintenance. Simkit added stochastic simulation capabilities to the KEE environment. These capabilities included an event model, random distribution generators, simulation visualization, and more. The Simkit tool was an early example of KBE. It could define a simulation in terms of class models and rules and then run the simulation as a conventional simulation would. Along the way, the simulation could continue to invoke rules, demons, and object methods, providing the potential for much richer simulation as well as analysis than conventional simulation tools. One of the issues that Simkit faced was a common issue for most early KBE systems developed with this method: The Lisp knowledge-based environments provide very powerful knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities; however, they did so at the cost of massive requirements for memory and processing that stretched the limits of the computers of the time. Simkit could run simulations with thousands of objects and do very sophisticated analysis on those objects. However, industrial simulations often required tens or hundreds of thousands of objects, and Simkit had difficulty scaling up to such levels. The second alternative to developing KBE is illustrated by the CATIA product suite. CATIA started with products for CAD and other traditional industrial engineering applications and added knowledge-based capabilities on to them; for example, their KnowledgeWare module. History  KBE developed in the 1980s. It was part of the initial wave of investment in Artificial Intelligence for business that fueled expert systems. Like expert systems, it relied on what at the time were leading edge advances in corporate information technology such as PCs, workstations, and client-server architectures. These same technologies were also facilitating the growth of CAx and CAD software. CAD tended to drive leading edge technologies and even push them past their current limits. The best example of this was object-oriented programming and database technology, which were adapted by CAD when most corporate information technology shops were dominated by relational databases and procedural programming. As with expert systems, KBE suffered a downturn during the AI Winter. Also, as with expert systems and artificial intelligence technology in general, there was renewed interest with the Internet. In the case of KBE, the interest was perhaps strongest in the business-to-business type of electronic commerce and technologies that facilitate the definition of industry standard vocabularies and ontologies for manufactured products. The semantic web is the vision of Tim Berners Lee for the next generation of the Internet. This will be a knowledge-based Internet built on ontologies, objects, and frame technologies that were also enabling technologies for KBE. Important technologies for the semantic web are XML, RDF, and OWL. The semantic web has excellent potential for KBE, and KBE ontologies and projects are a strong area for current research. KBE and product lifecycle management  Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is the management of the manufacturing process of any industry that produces goods. It can span the full product lifecycle from idea generation to implementation, delivery, and disposal. KBE at this level will deal with product issues of a more generic nature than it will with CAx. A natural area of emphasis is on the production process; however, lifecycle management can cover many more issues such as business planning, marketing, etc. An advantage of using KBE is getting the automated reasoning and knowledge management services of a knowledge-based environment integrated with the many diverse but related needs of lifecycle management. KBE supports the decision processes involved with configuration, trades, control, management, and a number of other areas, such as optimization. KBE and CAx CAx refers to the domain of computer-aided tools for analysis and design. CAx spans multiple domains. Examples are computer-aided design of manufactured parts, software, the architecture of buildings, etc. Although each specific domain of CAx will have very different kinds of problems and artifacts, they all share common issues as well such as having to manage collaboration of sophisticated knowledge workers, design and re-use of complex artifacts, etc. Essentially KBE extends, builds on, and integrates with the CAx domain typically referred to as Computer Aided Design (CAD). In this sense KBE is analogous to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering, which extended the domain of Computer Aided Software Engineering with knowledge-based tools and technology. What KBSE was to software and CASE, KBE is to manufactured products and CAD. An example can be taken from Boeing's experience. The 777 Program took on the challenge of having a digitally-defined plane. That required an investment in large-scale systems, databases, and workstations for design and analytical engineering work. Given the magnitude of the computing work that was required, KBE got its toe in the door, so to speak, through a \\"pay as you go plan.\\" Essentially, this technique was to show benefits and then to obtain more work (think agile engineering) thereby. In the case of the 777, the project got to where influences to changes in the early part of the design/build stream (loads) could be recomputed over a weekend to allow evaluation by downstream processes. As required, engineers were in the loop to finish and sign off on work. At the same time, CAx allowed tighter tolerances to be met. With the 777, KBE was so successful that subsequent programs applied it in more areas. Over time, KBE facilities were integrated into the CAx platform and are a normal part of the operation.See Talk Page, Point-in-Time example - references need to be updated KBE and knowledge management One of the most important knowledge-based technologies for KBE is knowledge management. Knowledge management tools support a wide spectrum repository, i.e., a repository that can support all different types of work artifacts: informal drawings and notes, large database tables, multimedia and hypertext objects, etc. Knowledge management provides the various group support tools to help diverse stake holders collaborate on the design and implementation of products. It also provides tools to automate the design process (e.g., rules) and to facilitate re-use. KBE methodology  The development of KBE applications concerns the requirements to identify, capture, structure, formalize, and finally implement knowledge. Many different so-called KBE platforms support only the implementation step, which is not always the main bottleneck in the KBE development process. In order to limit the risk associated with the development and maintenance of KBE application, there is a need to rely on an appropriate methodology for managing the knowledge and maintaining it up to date. As example of such KBE methodology, the EU project MOKA, \\"Methodology and tools Oriented to Knowledge based Applications,\\" proposes solutions which focus on the structuring and formalization steps as well as links to the implementation. An alternative to MOKA is to use general knowledge engineering methods that have been developed for expert systems across all industries or to use general software development methodologies such as the Rational Unified Process or Agile methods. Languages for KBE Two critical issues for the languages and formalisms used for KBE are: * Knowledge-based vs. procedural programming * Standardization vs. proprietary = Knowledge-based vs. procedural programming = A fundamental trade-off identified with knowledge representation in artificial intelligence is between expressive power and computability. As Levesque demonstrated in his classic paper on the topic, the more powerful a knowledge-representation formalism one designs, the closer the formalism will come to the expressive power of first order logic. As Levesque also demonstrated, the closer a language is to First Order Logic, the more probable that it will allow expressions that are undecidable or require exponential processing power to complete. In the implementation of KBE systems, this trade off is reflected in the choice to use powerful knowledge- based environments or more conventional procedural and object-oriented programming environments. = Standardization vs. proprietary = There is a trade off between using standards such as STEM and vendor- or business- specific proprietary languages. Standardization facilitates knowledge sharing, integration, and re-use. Proprietary formats (such as CATIA) can provide competitive advantage and powerful features beyond current standardization. Genworks GDL, a commercial product whose core is based on the AGPL-licensed Gendl Project, addresses the issue of application longevity by providing a high-level declarative language kernel which is a superset of a standard dialect of the Lisp programming language (ANSI Common Lisp, or CL). Gendl/GDL itself is proposed as a de facto standard for ANSI CL-based KBE languages. In 2006, the Object Management Group released a KBE services RFP document and requested feedback. To date, no OMG specification for KBE exists; however, there is an OMG standard for CAD services. An example of a system-independent language for the development of machine-readable ontologies that is in the KBE domain is Gellish English.

It features Wally Week as the central character and is the second (after Automania) of a series of games featuring Wally and/or members of his family. It was published by Mikro-Gen (through Amsoft for the Amstrad version). Starting in July 1986, Your Sinclair magazine published a monthly comic strip based on the character. There are two different versions of the game. The original plays the song \\"Popcorn\\", the second release plays an original tune. Four other Wally Week games were released: Automania, Everyone's A Wally, Herbert's Dummy Run, and Three Weeks in Paradise. Gameplay Pyjamarama is an action-adventure game set across several interconnecting rooms. The player takes the role of Wally, who has gone to bed for the night and has to wake up early in the morning for work. Unfortunately, his alarm clock has not been wound, and thus he will sleep late in the morning, and his boss will fire him. However, in his sleep, Wally's consciousness travels around his home, and other places, wearing his pyjamas, in search for the key to rewind the alarm clock and wake himself up. Pyjamarama on the ZX Spectrum. Wally is asleep in bed on the left of the screen, his dream-self is smaller on the far right. Commodore 64 screenshot The game is made up of static single-screen rooms, each of which can include platforms in various arrangements, objects to pick up, and enemies to avoid. Wally can walk through the screens to progress through the game's map and to pick up objects. Wally can carry two items in a first in, first out arrangement. Contact with an enemy drains Wally's \\"snooze energy\\", and if it runs out, Wally loses one of his lives. Snooze energy can be regained by drinking milk, which appears at various locations in the game. When all lives are lost, Wally returns to sleep and does not wake up until late in the morning, losing the game. One of the rooms in the game is a video games room, in which Wally can play a version of Space Invaders against various sprites from other parts of the game. If all the rounds are completed, Wally is rewarded with an extra life. Pyjamarama can be played either with a joystick or with the keyboard. There are three controls: walk left, walk right, and jump. Reception The ZX Spectrum version of Pyjamarama received the Game of the Month award in the November 1984 issue of Personal Computer Games, beating the BBC Micro version of Elite to the title.

The examiner uses a retinoscope to shine light into the patient's eye and observes the reflection (reflex) off the patient's retina. While moving the streak or spot of light across the pupil the examiner observes the relative movement of the reflex or manually places lenses over the eye (using a trial frame and trial lenses) to \\"neutralize\\" the reflex. Static retinoscopy is a type of retinoscopy used in determining a patient's refractive error. It relies on Foucault knife-edge test, which states that the examiner should simulate optical infinity to obtain the correct refractive power. Hence, a power corresponding to the working distance is subtracted from the gross retinoscopy value to give the patient's refractive condition, the working distance lens being one which has a focal length of the examiner's distance from the patient (e.g. +1.50 dioptre lens for a 67 cm working distance). Myopes display an \\"against\\" reflex, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is a different direction to that in which the light beam is swept. Hyperopes, on the other hand, display a \\"with\\" movement, which means that the direction of movement of light observed from the retina is the same as that in which the light beam is swept. Static retinoscopy is performed when the patient has relaxed accommodative status. This can be obtained by the patient viewing a distance target or by the use of cycloplegic drugs (where, for example, a child's lack of reliable fixation of the target can lead to fluctuations in accommodation and thus the results obtained). Dynamic retinoscopy is performed when the patient has active accommodation from viewing a near target. Retinoscopy is particularly useful in prescribing corrective lenses for patients who are unable to undergo a subjective refraction that requires a judgement and response from the patient (such as children or those with severe intellectual disabilities or communication problems). In most tests however, it is used as a basis for further refinement by subjective refraction. It is also used to evaluate accommodative ability of the eye and detect latent hyperopia.

She is characterized as a tough, resourceful frontier woman who repeatedly outsmarted Tory soldiers, and killed some outright. Stories about her are mostly unsupported by contemporary documentation, and it has been impossible for researchers to entirely distinguish fact from folklore. Early life Although explicit details concerning most of her life are unknown, Nancy Ann Morgan Hart is believed to have been born in North Carolina around 1735, in the Yadkin River valley. (Some researchers think that she was born in Pennsylvania or New York). She married Benjamin Hart of that area. His extended family's descendants included such famous later political figures as Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. During the early 1770s, Nancy, Benjamin and their family left North Carolina and migrated into Georgia, settling in the extremely fertile Broad River valley of the northeast Piedmont area. There she drew on her many frontier skills, including herbalism, hunting and shooting.Ouzts, Clay. \\"Nancy Hart (ca. 1735‚Äì1830)\\"., New Georgia Encyclopedia. 28 August 2013. Web. 29 October 2013. Hart was well connected through family ties to other prominent figures in early American history. She was a cousin to Revolutionary War general Daniel Morgan, who commanded victorious American forces at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina on January 17, 1781. According to contemporary accounts, \\"Aunt Nancy,\\" as she was often called, was a tall, gangly woman. She was rough-hewn and rawboned, with red hair and a face scarred by smallpox. One early account said that Hart had \\"no share of beauty‚Äîa fact she herself would have readily acknowledged, had she ever enjoyed an opportunity of looking into a mirror.\\" Hart was said to have a feisty personal demeanor characterized by a hotheaded temper, a fearless spirit, and a penchant for exacting vengeance upon those who offended her or harmed her family and friends. Many remembered that she, rather than her husband, ran the Hart household. They had a total of six sons and two daughters. Although she was illiterate, Hart was amply blessed with the skills and knowledge necessary for frontier survival; she was an expert herbalist, a skilled hunter, and an excellent shooter. Revolutionary War accounts According to one account, during the Revolution, a group of five or six Tory soldiers came by the Hart house looking either for food or a Whig they were pursuing (accounts vary). The soldiers demanded that Hart cook them one of her turkeys, and she agreed to feed them. As they entered the cabin, they placed their guns by the door before sitting at her table to eat. As they were drinking and eating, she pushed their guns outside through a hole in the wall of the cabin. After the soldiers had been drinking a sufficient time, she grabbed one of the remaining guns and ordered the men to stay still. One ignored her threat, so she shot and killed him. Another made a move toward the weapons, and she killed him as well. She held the remaining Tories captive until her husband and neighbors arrived. According to legend, her husband wanted to shoot the soldiers outright, but she demanded that they be hanged, which was accomplished from a nearby tree. The various versions of this story provide different details. But in 1912 construction crews working on the Elberton and Eastern Railroad in the area found evidence that seemed to validate the legend.\\"Skeletons of Six Tories Hanged Near Elberton, Found,\\" The Atlanta Constitution, 23 December 1912, p. 3.\\"Skeletons of Tories Killed by Nancy Hart Unearthed Tuesday\\", Lavonia Times and Gauge, 3 January 1913. While grading a railroad site less than a mile from the old Hart Cabin, the workers found five or six skeletons buried neatly in a row. A few of the skeletons' necks were broken, which suggested they had been hanged. They were determined to have been buried for at least 100 years. In 1925 Cook published a version based on an 1825 newspaper article in her county history.Cook, Anna Maria Green. History of Baldwin County Georgia. Anderson, S.C.: Keys-Hearn Printing Co., 1925, pp. 165‚Äì166. McIntosh quoted two such stories in a 1940 history of Elbert County.McIntosh, John H. The Official History of Elbert County, 1790‚Äì1935 (Supplement 1935‚Äì39 by Stephen Heard Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, organized 1901, Elberton, Georgia). Edited and published by Stephen Heard Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, 1940, p. 1,722. Other stories Mrs. Louisa H. Kendall was the niece of John Hart, the son whom Nancy lived with in later life. Kendall wrote a letter in 1872 recalling some of the stories her uncle had heard from his mother.Cook, op.cit., pp. 159‚Äì60 According to this letter, once when Nancy was taking a bag of grain to the mill, a band of Tories forced her off her horse and threw the grain to the ground. Undaunted, Hart picked up the heavy bag and walked the rest of the way to the mill. Nancy Hart was said to have acted as a sniper, killing Tories as they came across the Broad River. McIntosh quotes a Mr. Snead, who was also related to the Harts. He said that one time during the war, Nancy was cooking lye soap in her cabin when her daughter discovered a spy looking through a crack in the wall. Hart threw a ladle of the boiling soap into the spy's eyes, went outside and tied him up, and turned him over to the local Patriot militia.McIntosh, op. cit., p. 17 Two accounts say that Nancy dressed as a man in order to enter Tory camps, where she could overhear talk and observe the layouts and other elements of military value.Macintosh, op.cit., pp. 21‚Äì22 According to folklore, the local Native Americans referred to her as \\"Wahatche\\" which may translate to \\"War Woman\\", and named a creek for her. But many scholars dispute this, as there were records of the Cherokee name for the creek prior to the war. In addition, the late 19th-century ethnographer James Mooney noted, \\"Several cases of women acting the part of warriors are on record among the Cherokee.\\"Mooney, James. Myths of the Cherokee. New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1995, a reproduction of Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1897‚Äì98: in Two Parts‚ÄîPart I. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1900, p. 419. During the Civil War a group of women in LaGrange Georgia drew inspiration from Nancy Hart and formed an all-female militia designed to guard their town from Federal troops. They called their group the Nancy Harts in honor of her. Life after the war George Rockingham Gilmer, twice governor of Georgia before 1850, knew Hart personally. In an account of early settlers which he published in 1855, he wrote that she became \\"religious\\" after the War: > A Methodist society was formed in her neighborhood. She went to the house of > worship in search of relief. She found the good people assembled in class > meeting, and the door closed against intruders. She took out her knife, cut > the fastening and stalked in.

Mitchell in Cook, op.cit., pp. 160‚Äì162.) During the late 1780s, the Harts moved to Brunswick, Georgia. (Some accounts suggest that they may have spent time in Alabama and South Carolina as well). Benjamin Hart died shortly thereafter. Nancy Hart returned to the settlement on the Broad River but found that a flood had washed away their former cabin. Eventually, she settled with her son John Hart and his family along the Oconee River in Clarke County near Athens. Around 1803 John Hart took his mother and family to Henderson County, Kentucky, where they settled again near relatives. Hart spent the remaining years of her life there. She was buried in the Hart family cemetery a few miles outside of Henderson. Legacy On the approximate site of Hart's frontier cabin along River Road in Elbert County, the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a replica cabin in the early 20th century. They used chimney stones recovered from the site of the original cabin, which had stood on the crest of a large hill overlooking Wahachee Creek. Georgians have memorialized Nancy Hart in several place names: *Hart County, organized to the north of Elbert County, was named for her, as was its county seat, Hartwell. *During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), a group of women in LaGrange, Georgia, founded a militia company, which they named the Nancy Harts, to defend the town from the Union Army.

Supported fuel types generally include gasoline, but may also include diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, biofuels and recharge electricity. The main utility of these websites is that they allow users to find the lowest price of gasoline in their area, since gasoline prices often vary significantly between gas stations in the same neighborhood. In addition to listing prices for particular filling stations, some of sites also show the average cost of gasoline in the area and price trends.  Commercial services  Many commercial websites allow registered users or site visitors to update the price information, usually for an incentive such as \\"points\\" which are accumulated and displayed alongside a user's name. In some cases, points can be redeemed for rewards, such as an entry in a drawing for a prize, such as electric vehicles and free fuel cards. Some sites also provide message forums to allow users to engage in discussions about gas prices and money-saving strategies, among other topics. Fuel prices are sometimes made available via SMS text messaging. One site, Gasbuddy.com, has different web addresses for different cities in the United States and Canada. The site offers one gasoline gift card every day to contributors.  Government-sponsored services  In Western Australia, the FuelWatch concept is a free service, backed by Government legislation. The system was considered for implementation nationwide, but was met with some controversy. The FuelWatch concept requires all fuel retailers in Perth, and approximately 80% of those within the state but outside of the state capital area, to notify their \\"tomorrow prices\\" by 2pm each day.

His paternal uncle was Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, the Boston businessman and U.S. Minister to France. His father, Joseph Randolph Coolidge, was a great-grandson of the 3rd United States President Thomas Jefferson, through his maternal grandparents, Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. and Martha Jefferson Randolph. John's great-uncles were Thomas Jefferson Randolph, George Wythe Randolph, Andrew Jackson Donelson, and his grandfather, Joseph Coolidge, was a distant relative of President Calvin Coolidge. Through his mother, John was the nephew of John Lowell Gardner II and his wife Isabella Stewart Gardner. His mother and uncle John were the grandchildren of merchant Joseph Peabody, one of the wealthiest men in the United States at the time of his death in 1844.Hunt, F. [1858].

The plot revolves around a rash of seemingly inexplicable, explosive spontaneous human combustions and Danny O'Neill (Brosnan), a bomb disposal expert that gets involved and will eventually have to solve the case. Plot summary When a Senator is killed in an explosion, the FBI investigates. The agent in charge is bomb expert Danny O'Neill (Pierce Brosnan), who is separated from his wife Terry (Lisa Eilbacher) (due to the accidental drowning of their only child in their pool) and behaving very erratically. Initially the investigation does not reveal the kind of explosive used or even what was used to detonate it. Eventually it is learned that terrorists led by Mikhail Rashid (Ben Cross) have developed an \\"invisible\\" liquid explosive which is activated within the human body (by stomach acid). It also does not help that they have to report to Senator Traveres (Ron Silver), the man whom Terry is having an affair with and whom Danny also assaulted. Later, another senator is killed while riding in a limousine; the limo being driven by one of Rashid's henchmen. The henchman is subsequently struck by a moving car, taken into custody and brought into court, and since he is now considered a risk by Rashid, the judge in the case is slipped the liquid and she spontaneously explodes; the witness is subsequently killed, though O'Neill discovers the cause of the explosions - the chemically enhanced water in the judge's pitcher. It becomes obvious that the next target is Senator Traveres, so O'Neill, concerned that Terry may become collateral damage, trails his every move. At a fundraiser, Traveres is targeted by Rashid's main henchman, Al-red (Tony Plana), disguised as a clown. O'Neill alerts the public to the bomb's presence, and in desperation, Al-red ingests some of the infected liquid. O'Neill subdues Al-red and gets him away from party in a wheelchair just before he explodes. In the aftermath, O'Neill and Terry finally reconcile. Aware that Traveres is still not safe, O'Neill infiltrates the senator's heavily guarded mansion, at a very convenient time as it is being overrun by the terrorists. O'Neill concocts a cornucopia of home-made weapons, even building bombs using fertilizer found in the kitchen cabinet. All the terrorists are killed except for Rashid, who holds Terry hostage in front of him and Traveres. Rashid swallows some of the liquid, sealing his fate but intending to bring them all down with him. O'Neill manages to free Terry and send her to safe ground. He and Traveres however are cornered and are thus subsequently forced to jump from the third floor due to Rashid's explosion. Traveres lands on a wrought-iron fence which impales and kills him, though O'Neill survives. A year later, he has a second child with Terry.

The Shinmeikai kokugo jiten is one of the most popular dictionaries among high-school students. According to Sanseido, all the editions have collectively sold over 19,500,000 copies.

They revealed the idiosyncratic nature of many dictionary definitions written by Yamada. In addition to providing a general definition of a word, this editor sometimes added personal commentaries reflecting his experience and philosophy, making the otherwise bland definitions an enjoyable and at times philosophical reading. For example, compare these definitions of ren'ai (ÊÅãÊÑõ \\"love\\") in a common dictionary and the Shinmeikai: > *Love between a man and a woman, or the feeling one feels in such a > situation. *To feel an affection for an individual of the opposite sex so > intense that one would not regret sacrificing anything for that person; the > person is constantly on one‚Äôs mind, prompting the wish to always be together > and share a private world; one feels happy when that desire is satisfied and > anxious or depressed should the slighted doubt about that person‚Äôs > affections arise.

It is both a satire of the civil rights struggle in the United States of the late 1960s and a serious attempt to focus on the issue of black militancy. Dan Freeman, the titular protagonist, is enlisted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in its elitist espionage program, becoming its token black person. After mastering agency tactics, however, he becomes disillusioned and drops out to train young Chicago blacks as \\"Freedom Fighters\\". As a story of one man's reaction to white ruling-class hypocrisy, the film is loosely autobiographical and personal. The novel and the film also dramatize the CIA's history of giving training to persons and/or groups who later utilize their specialized intelligence training against the agency - an example of \\"blowback.\\" Directed by Ivan Dixon, co-produced by Dixon and Greenlee, from a screenplay written by Greenlee with Mel Clay, the film starred Lawrence Cook, Paula Kelly, Janet League, J. A. Preston, and David Lemieux. It was mostly shot in Gary, Indiana, because the themes of racial strife did not please Chicago's then-mayor Richard J.

Plot The story takes place in the early 1970s in Chicago. The CIA has been required for political reasons to recruit African Americans for training. Only one of them, Dan Freeman (Lawrence Cook), secretly a black nationalist, successfully completes the training process. He becomes the first black man in the agency and is given a desk job‚ÄîTop Secret Reproduction Center Sections Chief (which means he is in charge of the copy machine). Freeman understands that he is the token black person in the CIA, and that the CIA defines his function as providing proof of the agency's supposed commitment to integration and progress. Therefore, after completing his training in guerrilla warfare techniques, weaponry, communications and subversion, Freeman puts in just enough time to avoid raising any suspicions about his motives before he resigns from the CIA and returns to work in the social services in Chicago. Upon his return, Freeman immediately begins recruiting young black men living in inner-city Chicago to become \\"Freedom Fighters\\", teaching them all the tactics that he had learned from the CIA. They become a guerrilla group, with Freeman as the secret leader. The \\"Freedom Fighters\\" set out to ensure that black people truly live freely within the United States by partaking in both violent and non-violent actions throughout Chicago. The Freedom Fighters of Chicago begin spreading the word about their guerrilla warfare tactics across the United States; as Freeman says, \\"What we got now is a colony, what we want is a new nation.\\" As revolt and a war of liberation continues in inner-city Chicago, the National Guard and the police desperately try to stop the \\"freedom fighters\\". The film provides discussions about black militancy and the violent reactions that took place by white America in response to the progress of the Civil Rights Movement.

The political atmosphere in the United States during the time of the book's publication was particularly contentious, as civil rights, women‚Äôs rights, and gay rights movements became visible in the public sphere. Tim Reid, whose company helped to release Spook on DVD, said to the Los Angeles Times in 2004: \\"When you look back at the times...Martin Luther King was assassinated, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy. Black people were really angry and frustrated; we were tired of seeing our leaders killed. What do we do? Do we have a revolution? There is nothing that comes close to this movie in terms of black radicalism.\\" Soon after its release, with the facilitation of FBI suppression, as author Sam Greenlee believed, the film was removed from theaters as a result of its politically controversial message.Schudel, Matt (May 20, 2014), \\"Sam Greenlee, whose movie 'The Spook Who Sat by the Door' became a cult classic, dies\\", The Washington Post. Nina Metz wrote in the Chicago Tribune: \\"For years it was only available on bootleg video. In 2004, the actor Tim Reid tracked down a remaining negative stored in a vault under a different name ('When they want to lose something, they lose it,' Reid told the Tribune at the time) and released it on DVD.\\"Metz, Nina (August 18, 2011), \\"New doc unearths story behind making of 'The Spook Who Sat By the Door'\\", Chicago Tribune. In a 2004 feature for NPR, Karen Bates reported that the director of the film, Ivan Dixon, admitted that United Artists would not show the film in a way that would allow its political message to come through when clips were viewed prior to the film‚Äôs public release. \\"Dixon says when United Artists screened the finished product and saw a Panavision version of political Armageddon, they were stunned.\\" It has been retrospectively suggested that the film \\"falls under the auspice of Blaxploitation but the political reality with which it dealt, that of black militancy and anti establishment ideology, is an aspect that most films avoided in fear of commercial alienation and criticism from the white establishment. ...Ivan Dixon‚Äôs film seems to be a missing link between the work of black film makers in the 1970s and the confrontational politics of a contemporary black film maker like Spike Lee.\\"Ahmed, Omar, \\"THE SPOOK WHO SAT BY THE DOOR (Dir. Ivan Dixon, 1973, US) ‚Äì ‚ÄòYou have just played out the American dream‚Ä¶now, we‚Äôre gonna turn it into a nightmare‚Äô\\", Movie Mahal, July 18, 2018. Critical reception Film critics agree that The Spook Who Sat By the Door is a significant movie in that it presents a highly politically charged vision of black people, and according to PopMatters the film \\"remains one of the few uncompromised representations of black armed resistance in the United States.\\"Fuchs, Cynthia (March 28, 2004), \\"The Spook Who Sat By the Door (1973)\\" (review), PopMatters. In a 2004 review for Philadelphia City Paper, Sam Adams recognizes the importance of Spook‚Äôs questioning of politics and race in America, despite some other technical weaknesses. Adams writes: \\"the movie's sly polemicism has arguably aged better than the revolutionary rhetoric that inspired it\\", and notes that the conflict within Spook in its use of stereotypical imagery along with its revolutionary political message: \\"Hailed as a landmark and denounced as racist, 'The Spook Who Sat by the Door' is, at the very least, still worth arguing over.\\" Similarly, Vincent Canby‚Äôs 1973 review of the film for The New York Times notes the film‚Äôs use of stereotypes in order to convey the message at the heart of it: \\"The rage it projects is real, even though the means by which that rage is projected are stereotypes. Black as well as white\\". Canby also notes the difficulty he had with reviewing the film in that, although it is not technically impressive or innovative, its political and racial significance is not to be underestimated or dismissed. \\"...'The Spook Who Sat by the Door' is a difficult work to judge coherently. It is such a mixture of passion, humor, hindsight, prophecy, prejudice and reaction that the fact that it's not a very well-made movie, and is seldom convincing as melodrama, is almost beside the point.\\" According to David Somerset of the British Film Institute (where the film was screened in May 2012 as part of their \\"African Odysseys\\" strand):\\"May 2012 at BFI Southbank\\", BFI press release, March 2012.\\"Cointelpro 101 and the Spook Who Sat by the Door\\", Black History Studies, June 1, 2012.\\"Spook Who Sat By The Door: BFI talk with publisher\\", October 26, 2012. \\"the major achievement of Spook is its depiction of a spectrum of social roles within the African-American community. It's a vivid picture of the language of race politics whose complexity and inherent contradictions go to the heart of the African-American experience, encouraging the viewer to transcend class and consider their collective plight. Without this critique of individual complicity in oppression, The Spook Who Sat by the Door could be accused of being a rabble-rousing exercise in fuelling blind resentment, but as Freeman tells a fellow gang member, 'This is not about hating white folks‚Ä¶ this is about loving freedom enough to fight and die for it.'\\"Somerset, David (March 31, 2015), \\"The battle of Chicago: The Spook Who Sat by the Door\\", Sight & Sound, BFI. Richard Brody, writing in The New Yorker in 2018, describes the film as \\"a distinctive and accomplished work of art, no mere artifact of the times\\".Brody, Richard (July 20, 1018), \\"The Troubling Fate of a 1973 Film About the First Black Man in the C.I.A.\\", The New Yorker. Title The title refers to a practice in the early days of affirmative action when the first Black person hired by a company or agency would be seated close to the office entrance so that all who came and went could see that the company was racially mixed. The word \\"spook\\" in the title has a dual meaning: a racial slur for an African American and a slang term for spy. The same dual meaning plays a role in the plot of the 2000 Philip Roth novel, The Human Stain, as well as in the film made after the book. This is shown in Spook when Freeman is asked to give a tour to senators. After Freeman takes the senators on their tour, one of the senators stays back and congratulates the General for integrating Freeman into his personal staff. The General tells his second-in-command that making Freeman a part of his personal staff sounds like a good idea. The agent responds by saying: \\"We can put him out in reception, so all of our visitors can see we're integrated.\\"\\"The Spook Who Sat By The Door\\".

This hairstyle called for a man with naturally \\"kinky\\" hair to have it chemically straightened using a relaxer (sometimes the pure corrosive chemical lye), so that the newly straightened hair could be styled in specific ways. Often, the relaxer was made at home, by mixing lye, eggs, and potatoes, the applier having to wear gloves and the receiver's head having to be rinsed thoroughly after application to avoid chemical burns. Conks were often styled as large pompadours although other men chose to simply slick their straightened hair back, allowing it to lie flat on their heads. Regardless of the styling, conks required a considerable amount of effort to maintain: a man often had to wear a do-rag of some sort at home, to absorb sweat or other agents to keep them from causing his hair to revert to its natural state prematurely. Also, the style required repeated application of relaxers; as new hair grew in, it too had to be chemically straightened. Many of the popular musicians of the early to mid 20th century, including Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Louis Jordan, Little Richard, James Brown, and the members of The Temptations and The Miracles, were well known for sporting the conk hairstyle. The gatefold of the 1968 album Electric Mud shows blues legend Muddy Waters having his hair conked. The style fell out of popularity when the Black Power movement of the 1960s took hold, and the Afro became a popular symbol of African pride. The conk was a major plot device in Spike Lee's film biography Malcolm X, based upon Malcolm X's own condemnation of the hairstyle as black self-degradation in his autobiography because of its implications about the superiority of a more \\"white\\" appearance and because of the pain the process causes and the possibility of receiving severe burns to the scalp. The conk is all but extinct as a hairstyle among African-American men today, although more mildly relaxed hairstyles such as the Jheri curl and the S-curl were popular during the 1980s and 1990s. Culture In The Autobiography of Malcolm X, it is mentioned that at one point the prevalence of the conk hairstyle, \\"makes you wonder if the Negro has completely lost all sense of identity, lost touch with himself\\". =Documentary= The history of the conk is featured in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story, that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry.

It is one of a number of stations to have held the name at various times and should not be confused with the current Alexandra Palace station which is on the East Coast Main Line to the east of the closed station. The former station was the terminus of a short branch line from Highgate. The preceding station on the branch was . The station was located immediately adjacent to the north side of the Palace buildings. Nothing remains of the tracks or island platform today, which have been removed and covered by a car park, but the small station building remains and is in use as a community centre. History Edgware Highgate & London Railway, 1900 The station was built by the Muswell Hill Railway (MHR) and opened on 24 May 1873 along with the Palace. However, when the Palace burned down only two weeks after opening, the train service was considerably reduced and from 1 August 1873 was stopped for almost two years whilst the Palace was rebuilt. The station reopened on 1 May 1875, but there were several further periods of temporary closure due to insufficient demand, including from August 1882 to March 1885 and September 1885 to May 1889. When it reopened in March 1891 after another closure it was renamed Alexandra Park in reference to the wider area rather than just the Palace in order to stoke higher demand. The increased demand did not materialise, and the original Alexandra Palace name was restored in 1898. In 1911 the line was taken over by the Great Northern Railway. After the 1921 Railways Act created the \\"Big Four\\" railway companies, the line was, from 1923, part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The original Alexandra Palace station In 1935 London Underground planned, as part of its \\"New Works Programme\\" to take over the line from LNER together with the LNER's routes from to and , modernise it for use with electric trains and amalgamate it with the Northern line. Works to modernise the track began in the late 1930s and were well advanced when they were interrupted and halted by the Second World War. Works were completed from Highgate to High Barnet and Mill Hill East and that section was incorporated into the Northern line. Further works on the section between Highgate and Alexandra Palace were postponed and the line continued under the operation of the LNER. Because of wartime economy measures, services were reduced to rush hours only, so that after the war the dwindling passenger numbers and a shortage of funds led to the cancellation of the unfinished works in 1950. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) closed the line temporarily from 29 October 1951 until 7 January 1952,. With dwindling passenger numbers passenger services to Alexandra Palace last operated on British Railways on 3 July 1954 along with the rest of the line from Finsbury Park. The line as far as Muswell Hill continued to be used for goods traffic until 18 May 1957 when the section between Muswell Hill and Highgate was closed altogether. The tracks between Highgate and Finsbury Park were retained until the 1970s to enable the Northern City Line's tube stock to be transferred to and from Highgate depot and, as the tracks were not electrified, the trains had to be hauled by battery locomotives. Today the track has been removed and many of the platforms and station buildings have been demolished. At the former Station Master's house still stands and sees residential use, but the platforms and buildings have been removed. The opposite is true at , where the platforms survive almost intact but only fragments of the station building survive. The track bed between Muswell Hill and Finsbury Park is now largely part of the Parkland Walk.

Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall's early years were spent working on the family farm, an average-sized property which had of arable land. The farm primarily raised sheep and dairy cattle and provided pasture for the family horses and oxen (which were used for plowing fields). The family farmed corn, flax, hay, potatoes, and rye. A small part of the land was devoted to growing tobacco. Amos also assisted in clearing rocks from the farmland (which was extremely rocky and full of clay), and mending stone and split-rail fences. Kendall, p. 1-2. Accessed 2013-02-21.Cole, p. 14. Amos was a sickly child, thin and prone to colds and severe headaches. Amos Kendall attended free public elementary schools in Massachusetts and New Hampshire during two months each summer, and was a heavy user of the subscription library in Dunstable, Massachusetts (where his father had the right to check out two books a month). Kendall, p. 3-4. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall attended the New Ipswich Academy in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, for a few weeks in the fall of 1805, and a free public secondary school in New Ipswich for a month in the winter of 1806. In April 1806, he re-entered New Ipswich Academy, paying tuition by working at manual labor. He remained there until the fall, then studied a few weeks in December 1806 at a free public school in Dunstable. Kendall, p. 12-14. Accessed 2013-02-21. Although he was only 16 years old, Amos' education was advanced enough that his father obtained a two-month teaching position for him at a school in Reading, Massachusetts, in summer 1806 and another in the fall at a public school in Dunstable, New Hampshire (now known as Nashua). Kendall, p. 14. Accessed 2013-02-21.Cole, p. 18. Amos Kendall entered the Lawrence Academy at Groton in Groton, Massachusetts, in April 1807. Despite poor health, he felt prepared enough to apply to Dartmouth College. He succeeded, and was admitted to Dartmouth on September 10, 1807. Kendall, p. 15. Accessed 2013-02-21. =College education= Dartmouth College in the early 1800s Unable to afford the $80 to $90 cost of the fall and winter term, Zebedee Kendall obtained another teaching position for Amos at a school in Dunstable, New Hampshire. Away from his father's control for an extended period of time, Kendall began to play cards, dance, and occasionally drink alcohol.Cole, p. 18-19. With money in hand, he entered Dartmouth in March 1808.Cole, p. 21. Kendall joined the Social Friends, a fraternal society, as well as a small, semisecret study and debating society known as the Gymnasion Adelphon. Through the college's and society's libraries, he had access to more than 4,000 books (a huge number by the standards of the day), many of which were by recent authors and in fields which he had been unable to study while under his father's strict moral supervision. Kendall later said that the informal education he received through reading and discussion outside the classroom was more productive than the formal classes he attended.Cole, p. 22-23. Kendall spent the fall and winter terms of 1808 teaching in New Ipswich and began attending classes again in March 1809.Cole, p. 24. When the college banned on-campus drinking, students blamed Kendall ‚Äî who had circulated a petition to have it stopped. He was bullied and nearly assaulted on several occasions, and some students attempted to injure him by dropping heavy roof timbers onto him as he exited a building. Kendall would have left Dartmouth if not for the support of the members of the Gymnasion Adelphon. He later admitted that he learned a valuable lesson from the experience: Never attempt to impose his moral values on others.Cole, p. 24-25. In July 1809 he joined the Handel Society, and regularly participated in their productions. Kendall, p. 30. Accessed 2013-02-21. He again taught in Ipswich from November 1809 to February 1810. Kendall, p. 30-31. Accessed 2013-02-21. Returning to Dartmouth in the spring of 1810, Kendall's social standing at school improved. He participated in a prank in which the cattle of the townspeople were herded into a basement room at the college. When several students were brought up on charges, Kendall defended them so ably that the charges were dropped.Cole, p. 25. Kendall, like most people from Dunstable, was a member of the Democratic- Republican Party. But most students at Dartmouth belonged to the Federalist Party. When asked to provide an oration at the Independence Day celebrations in 1810, he declined by arguing that the Federalists were taking over the event. When he was embraced by the radical Democratic-Republicans, he refused their support by announcing that he found them too \\"Frenchified\\" (e.g., too supportive of Napoleonic France and not patriotic enough). His determination to stand his ground but not embrace radicalism won him a great deal of admiration.Cole, p. 26. Kendall taught school again during winter term 1810-1811.It is not clear where he taught. At one point, Kendall says in his Autobiography that he taught in New Ipswich. See: Kendall, p. 42-44, accessed 2013-02-21. But later in the work, Kendall asserts he taught in Weston, Massachusetts. See: Kendall, p. 59-60, accessed 2013-02-21.

Kendall, p. 65-68. Accessed 2013-02-21. Legal education, the Clay children, and legal practice =Legal education= William M. Richardson Shortly before graduation, Kendall traveled to Groton, Massachusetts, to seek a teaching position. He met with William M. Richardson, a prominent local attorney and friend of his father's. Richardson advised Kendall to abandon teaching and to study law. He became a legal apprentice in Richardson's legal practice on September 4, 1811. Since Richardson's current apprentice would not leave until March 1812, Kendall resolved to live in Groton.Cole, p. 27-28. All able-bodied men were required to join the local militia, and Kendall did so eagerly since his father had been a militiaman. But musters left him physically exhausted for days, he fainted at the sight of blood, and was so unable to withstand physical pain that he fainted when pricked with a needle. A physician certified him as unable to perform his duties.Cole, p. 29-30. But when funds ran out, he spent the winter of 1811-1812 at home reading law books and performing chores for his father. Kendall suffered a bout of \\"lung fever\\" (most likely community-acquired pneumonia) in June 1813 that left him bedridden for three weeks and suffering such severe migraines that he could not tolerate loud sounds.Cole, p. 30. =Teaching the children of Henry Clay= In the fall of 1813, Richardson announced that he was leaving Groton. Although Richardson offered to secure Kendall an apprenticeship with the attorney taking over his practice, Kendall declined the offer. Kendall decided that, with an economic depression afflicting New England and his only patron leaving, it was time to leave Massachusetts. Kendall, p. 86. Accessed 2013-02-21. He resolved to relocate to Washington, D.C., and arrived in the city on March 2, 1814. Kendall, p. 95. Accessed 2013-02-21. Introduced to numerous politicians by William M. Richardson, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives, he was hired by Senator Jesse Bledsoe of Kentucky to tutor the Bledsoe children. He left Washington on March 9, traveling by stagecoach to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then by flatboat down the Ohio River to Cincinnati, Ohio. He largely walked the south to Lexington, Kentucky,Cole, p. 37-40. reaching the city on April 12. One of the few images of Lucretia Hart Clay, depicted with her husband, Henry Clay Kendall claims that, upon arrival in Lexington, Senator Bledsoe hinted that he no longer wanted to use Kendall's services. Kendall, p. 112. Accessed 2013-02-21. Other sources, however, claim that Bledsoe's family had not learned of the senator's decision to hire Kendall as a tutor and refused to allow him in the home.Kleber, p. 486. Kendall angrily resolved to have nothing to do with Bledsoe. On April 27, Kendall, p. 113. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall met John Watkins, the younger half-brother of the powerful Speaker of the House of Representatives, Henry Clay. Watkins, a law student, frequented the same tavern which Kendall did, and quickly introduced Kendall to Henry Clay's wife, Lucretia. With seven children and both parents frequently absent from the Clay estate, Ashland, the Clays desperately needed someone who could help maintain order as well as educate the children. Mrs. Clay offered Kendall room, board, use of her husband's extensive library, and $300 a year (nearly three times as much as Bledsoe had promised).Heidler and Heidler, p. 120; Remini, Henry Clay, p. 200. He eagerly accepted the offer and began his duties on May 5. Kendall, p. 115. Accessed 2013-02-21. Amos Kendall spent only a year teaching the Clay children. Twelve-year-old Theodore exhibited violent rages and threatened the life of a slave with a knife, which foreshadowed the insanity which would claim him in 1833. Eleven-year-old Thomas threw extreme temper tantrums and often hurled abuse at Kendall. (Thomas suffered from severe depression throughout adulthood.) Neither boy was interested in studies, and Mrs. Clay was reluctant to rein them in. But Kendall's influence slowly exerted itself, and all the school-age Clay children began to show improvement in their studies and behavior.Cole, p. 44; Remini, Henry Clay, p. 200-203.Heidler and Heidler, p. 121. Additionally, Mrs. Clay taught Kendall many of the social skills his upbringing had not: How to walk with confidence, enter a room with flair, make small talk, and dance better.Heidler and Heidler, p. 120-121. Although he remained socially awkward due to his shyness, Kendall managed to impress many with his education, intellect, and penchant for reading and writing poetry.Cole, p. 45. =Establishing a legal practice= Determined to avoid teaching as a long-term career option, Kendall applied for a license to practice law in Kentucky. On October 12, 1814, he traveled to the state capital of Frankfort to present himself for examination before the Kentucky Court of Appeals. He asked Major William Barry (whom he had traveled with part of the way from Pennsylvania to Kentucky) to introduce him to the judges, but Barry did not appear. He then asked a Frankfort lawyer, Robert Wickliffe, to introduce him, but Wickliffe could not be found. Kendall introduced himself to the judges, and spent about an hour that night under examination. He was further examined in the morning. Kendall made so many errors (many of them in response to simple questions) that he feared he would not obtain the law license. But Barry and Wickliffe both appeared at midday and spoke privately with the judge examiners, and Kendall was granted his license that afternoon. Kendall, p. 129-131. Accessed 2013-02-21. He swore the legal oath on March 21, 1815. Kendall, p. 140. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall quit his employment with the Clays on April 29, 1814. Kendall, p. 142. Accessed 2013-02-21. Believing he could not establish a legal practice in Lexington,Cole. p. 48. Kendall resolved to move to an adjacent community. He explored the towns of Richmond, Nicholasville, Georgetown, and Versailles, and took up residence in Georgetown on May 10, 1815. Kendall, p. 142-145. Accessed 2013-02-21. On June 3, Kendall attended a Democratic-Republican meeting at the home of Representative Richard Mentor Johnson. Kendall, p. 147. Accessed 2013-02-21. Johnson was deeply impressed with Kendall's writing, and offered to sell him the local Democratic-Republican newspaper, the Georgetown Minerva. Kendall declined to buy the paper, but agreed to become its editor-in-chief.Cole, p. 50. Marriage and children Amos Kendall was markedly shy. In part, this was due to the lack of social graces taught to him in his childhood and adolescence. He did not actively participate in social gatherings until he moved to Groton, Massachusetts, in 1811. In Groton, he fell in love with 16-year-old Eliza, the sister of a prominent Boston family of merchants. She refused his attentions (as she was too young to marry), and Kendall wooed her older sister, Mary. But the loss of his legal apprenticeship and subsequent move to Kentucky in 1813 ended their relationship. Kendall married Mary Bullard Woolfolk of Louisville, Kentucky, on October 1, 1818.Green, p. 270. The couple had four children: Mary Anne (born in 1820), a stillborn boy, Adela (born in 1822), and William Zebedee (born in 1823).Cole, p. 63. On October 13, Mary died of a fever after a 10-day illness. On January 5, 1826, Kendall married 17-year-old Jane Kyle of Georgetown, Kentucky. She gave birth to four sons and seven daughters. Career as journalist and Postmaster General Front page of the Extra Globe for September 4, 1840 One June 12, before taking up his duties as editor of the Minerva, Kendall traveled to Lexington to attend a court session. Kendall, p. 148. Accessed 2013-02-21. He fell violently ill (possibly with hepatitis). Alone and unable to care for himself in his boardinghouse room, he nearly died. But Lucretia Clay learned of his illness and brought him to Ashland. For the next month, she nursed him back to health. He was well enough to return to Georgetown on July 15. In September 1815, Kendall agreed to purchase a half- interest in the Georgetown Minerva. Johnson allowed him to pay the purchase price of $1,000 in equal installments over the next five years, without interest. Kendall also agreed to buy the position of postmaster of the town from its current office-holder for $720 over four years (hoping that this position would give him access to news first). He briefly committed to teaching and investing in land speculation before backing out of both proposals.Cole, p. 51. He quickly learned that Johnson had mortgaged his half of the business to a brother-in-law, Robert Ward, and sold $800 of Kendall's promissory note to his brother, James Johnson. After an exchange of angry letters, James Johnson cancelled Kendall's debt, took possession of the Minerva, and agreed to let Kendall edit a new newspaper he was founding (the Georgetown Patriot).Cole, p. 52-53. Kendall began publishing the Georgetown Patriot in 1816.Cutlip, p. 75. In October 1816, he moved to Frankfort. He became part owner and editor-in-chief of the Argus of Western America. In 1829, Kendall was appointed Fourth Auditor of the United States Department of the Treasury. He soon discovered evidence of embezzlement by his predecessor, Tobias Watkins, which led to a high profile trial at Jackson's behest.Gilman, p. 64 The following year, Jackson supporters won control of the Washington Globe newspaper in Washington, D.C. The newspaper became the house organ of the Jackson administration, and Kendall brought Jackson's nephew, Francis Preston Blair, to Washington to be the paper's editor-in-chief. Along with men such as Blair, Duff Green, Isaac Hill, and William Berkeley Lewis, Kendall was a member of Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet. Over time, Kendall came to dominate the Kitchen Cabinet. He had arguably more influence over Jackson than any other Cabinet official or Kitchen Cabinet member.MacDonald, p. 51. Kendall took many of Jackson's ideas about government and national policy and refashioned them into highly polished, erudite official government statements and newspaper articles. These were then published in the Globe and other newspapers, enhancing Jackson's reputation as an intellectual. Kendall also drafted most of Jackson's five annual messages to Congress, and his statement vetoing the renewal of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States in 1832. Kendall was appointed U.S Postmaster General on May 1, 1835. During his time in office, he worked to eliminate corruption in the Post Office Department. He also manipulated operations of the Post Office Department so that western newspapers (which tended to support Jackson) were delivered faster and received better service than eastern ones. Despite having no legal basis for his action, he also allowed postal officials in the Deep South to refuse to deliver abolitionist literature.Vaughn, p. 241. Suffering from extreme poor health, Kendall, p. 434. Accessed 2013-02-21. he resigned as Postmaster General effective May 18, 1840.Dodge, p. 7. John Quincy Adams, a bitter foe of both Jackson and Van Buren, confided to his diary in December 1840 that he believed both men had been \\"for twelve years the tool of Amos Kendall, the ruling mind of their dominion.\\"Adams, p. 366. Kendall wrote extensively for the Washington Extra Globe newspaper in the summer and fall of 1840 in an unsuccessful effort to boost Van Buren's chances for re-election. Jackson, meanwhile, was interested in finding someone to write a biography of his life. He eventually settled on Kendall, who accepted the task. Of the projected 15 volumes, Kendall wrote seven volumes of approximately 30 pages each before abandoning the project. The part that was published encompasses Jackson's life until the end of the Creek War in 1814. Post-government career Calvary Baptist Church in 2008. Kendall financed its construction, and it was completed in 1866. It suffered a severe fire in 1868. This is the reconstructed building, finished in 1869. =Financial difficulties= Back in private life, he started two newspapers in Washington, D.C., but both ceased operations shortly after opening. Throughout the 1840s, Kendall was the subject of numerous lawsuits from postal contractors who sued him for damages over his manipulation of Post Office operations. While in office, Kendall lost one Supreme Court decision. He had refused to honor a contract for mail delivery signed by his predecessor, even though Congress had enacted legislation requiring him to do so. Kendall said the legislation was an unconstitutional infringement on the executive branch. In Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. 524 (1838), the Supreme Court disagreed.Hall and Ely, p. 555. But in Kendall v. Stokes, 44 U.S. 87 (1845), the Supreme Court held that Kendall was not personally liable for the debt owed, saving him from incarceration in debtors' prison. While the court cases were proceeding, Kendall's financial situation deteriorated. His two newspapers lost large sums of money, and the value of the land he owned in Kentucky was greatly depressed. He purchased a farm in northeast Washington for $9,000 in 1841 to generate income for himself, and named it Kendall Green.Cole, p. 235. But it was not enough. In 1838, Kendall had rented a 10-room mansion named Jackson Hill located at what is now the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.Morley, Jefferson. \\"The Ghosts of Jackson Hill.\\" Washington Post. September 13, 1998. He was forced to give up Jackson Hill in October 1841 and move his family into an unfinished, home at Kendall Green. Kendall reluctantly returned to the practice of law in 1843, representing individuals and groups which had financial claims against the U.S. government.Manning, p. 148. Among these were the Western Cherokee. Kendall helped to prove the independence of the Western Cherokee from the Old Nation, which gave them control over their lands and a portion of a $5 million settlement.Hoig, p. 203-204; Cole, p. 258. =Association with Samuel Morse= In March 1845, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail hired Kendall to be their business manager. Kendall agreed, and received a 10 percent commission on all patent licenses he was able to obtain.Bedi, p. 79. Two months later, Kendall incorporated the Magnetic Telegraph Company to own and operate a telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and New York City. It was the first privately owned telegraph line in the nation's history.Hochfelder, p. 182. Within seven years, Boston was linked with New York City; an extensive network of lines linked New York City with Albany and cities throughout Ohio and along the Mississippi River; and New Orleans was linked to Washington, D.C.Ratner and Teeter, p. 15. Patent commissions, the sale of Magnetic Telegraph to the American Telegraph Company in 1859, and other telegraph investments made Kendall a wealthy man again. =Founding Gallaudet University= In 1857, Kendall co-founded what would eventually become Gallaudet University for the deaf. Platt H. Skinner had brought 20 deaf children to Washington, D.C. to help raise money for a school for the deaf. Kendall served on the board of Skinner's school, and when a local court removed 15 of the children from Skinner's custody for abuse, the five remaining children (all orphans from New York) were placed in Kendall's care. Kendall incorporated the Kendall School, and donated his home and of land at Kendall Green for the school's use. On February 16, 1857, at Kendall's urging, Congress passed legislation giving the Kendall School a charter as the Columbia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. Three months later, Kendall hired Edward Miner Gallaudet as the school's first superintendent, while Kendall assumed the presidency of the institution's board of directors.Gallaudet, History of the College for the Deaf, 1857-1907. Various forces persuaded Gallaudet that a children's school was not enough and that a degree-granting college should be formed. The idea took years to develop, and Kendall was initially opposed to the idea, but Gallaudet persisted and on April 8, 1864, Congress passed legislation transforming the Columbia Institution into the National Deaf-Mute College. The Kendall School, now named Kendall Demonstration Elementary School, remained a unit of the college, and in 1865 Congress appropriated money for the purchase of of Kendall Green to form the grounds of the new college and permit construction of new instructional buildings. =Religious activities= In his later years, Kendall became increasingly pious and devoted himself to religious study. After a number of the members of the Third (E Street) Baptist Church were dismissed in May 1862 for being too theologically progressive,Wilbur, p. 7. Accessed 2013-02-21. they founded Calvary (Sixth) Baptist Church on June 2, 1862. Although Kendall was not a member of the church, he had a high regard for its pastor and offered to donate $90,000 toward construction of a building.Wilbur, p. 20. Accessed 2013-02-21. The congregation built a luxurious $115,000 house of worship. Kendall was welcomed as a member of Calvary Baptist Church on March 31, 1865.Wilbur, p. 24. Accessed 2013-02-21. The church opened its doors in June 1866, around the time Kendall was made a senior deacon in the church.Wilbur, p. 28. Accessed 2013-02-21. But within 18 months the building was consumed by fire. Insured for just $50,000, Kendall donated another $15,000 to rebuild the edifice.Cathcart, p. 337. Accessed 2013-02-21.Wilbur, p. 35-36. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall also provided for the purchase of land and construction of a chapel at 13-1/2 and D Streets Southwest. It was dedicated on November 21, 1869, just nine days after Kendall's death. It was named Kendall Chapel. Over time, the membership of this branch of Calvary Baptist Church grew large enough to constitute a separate church. The branch was spun off as a distinct congregation in November 1891, and the building renamed Kendall Baptist Church.Wilbur, p. 43. Accessed 2013-02-21. Death Grave of Amos Kendall at Glenwood Cemetery Kendall fell ill with a digestive illness and insomnia in the summer of 1869. On August 2, he traveled to New York City to visit a nephew. He fell ill with what he believed was a common cold, but by the time he returned to Washington, D.C., on August 14 he was bedridden. As his wife was preparing to move the household into the William Stickney mansion at 6th and M Streets NW, Kendall resided at the home of Robert C. Fox, his son-in-law. Three weeks later, and still bedridden, Kendall moved into the Stickney mansion. Stickney, p. 684-685. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall was unable to eat and was in great pain. He called his illness \\"bilious fever\\", but it was more likely cancer of the liver and the stomach. The pain was so great, Kendall considered suicide, and he remained bedridden until the end of his life.Cole, p. 294. Amos Kendall died at dawn at his home in the Stickney Mansion on Friday, November 12, 1869, and was interred in Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Stickney, p. 690-691. Accessed 2013-02-21. Kendall's will provided for the purchase of land and construction of a chapel of a second branch chapel for Calvary Baptist Church as well. This became known as Mission Chapel (later known as Memorial Chapel). His will also created a scholarship at what is now George Washington University. The scholarship was awarded to the student from the District of Columbia who scored the highest ranking on the college's entrance exam. The scholarship existed so long as a member of Calvary Baptist Church continued to sit on the university's board of trustees. Religious beliefs During his sophomore year at Dartmouth, Kendall's belief in Congregationalist theology began to waver. During a trip to Vermont to see relatives in September 1809, he worshiped at a Christian Church and was amazed to see that their religious services not only involved women but were emotionally charged. While living in Groton in the fall of 1811, he rejected Roman Catholicism and Unitarianism but was strongly attracted to the revivalist preaching of Congregational minister Edward Dodge Griffin.Cole, p. 29. While living in Lexington, he attended some Methodist churches, but found them too loud and bombastic.Cole, p. 43. Kendall later said that he converted to the Baptist faith shortly after establishing himself in Kentucky, although he did not formally join a Baptist congregation until 1865. Legacy Kendall County, Illinois, and Kendall, New York, are named in Kendall's honor. He is the namesake of Kendallville, Indiana. References Bibliography *Adams, John Quincy.

Expression of the gene has been linked to early formation of excitatory synapses through binding with receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP (LAR-RPTP). Various studies over the years have linked mutations in the gene to conditions on the OCD spectrum, Tourette syndrome and trichotillomania, however the mutations in the genome itself vary greatly between individuals, with most mutations observed being hard to find in repeat studies. Members of the SLITRK family, such as SLITRK1, are integral membrane proteins with 2 N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains similar to those of SLIT proteins (see SLIT1; MIM 603742). Most SLITRKs, but not SLITRK1, also have C-terminal regions that share homology with neurotrophin receptors (see NTRK1; MIM 191315). SLITRKs are expressed predominantly in neural tissues and have neurite-modulating activity (Aruga et al., 2003).  Gene  The gene for SLITRK1 is located on chromosome 13q31.1. The gene is expressed only in the brain of humans. The mRNA can differ from alternative splicing, and contains domains for the extracellular matrix as well as for the LRRs. Mice contain an ortholog of the gene called Slitrk1.  Protein structure  SLITRK1 contains 2 horseshoe shaped leucine rich repeat domains (LRRs) in its extracellular domain which are vital to its function. The LRRs have 6 modules each and are connected by a 70-90 amino acid loops. LRR1 is a more conserved sequence and is present as a dimer while LRR2 is a monomer and has a more variable sequence. The conserved sequence of LRR1 contains critical binding pockets and specific charged residues that are important for it to carry out its function of binding to LAR-RPTPs on the N-terminus. Both LRR sequences are randomly positioned on the protein and contain variable linker regions. The protein also contains a short intracellular domain, but lacks a tyrosine phosphorylation motif which is present in other SLITRK genes.  Function  SLITKR1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system. It plays a critical part in regulating synapse formation between hippocampal neurons and in differentiation of synapses, helping in neuronal outgrowth. It is expressed during embryonic stages and postnatally but expression decreases over time and is localized to the postsynaptic membrane. Overexpression of SLITKR1 promotes postsynaptic differentiation for excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but because of the localization only excitatory synapses are affected. Inhibition of SLITKR1 only reduces differentiation of excitatory synapses because of this. = Interaction with LAR-RPTP = Since they lack tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, SLITKR1 binds to LAR-RPTP through its LRR1 region in order to differentiate synapses. The LRR2 domain's function is not clearly understood yet but it is hypothesised that it is for dimerization to the cell surface. LAR-RPTP binds to the LRR1 region through its PTPŒ¥ Ig region, with 3 separate binding sites in a 1:1 binding ratio. Ig1 binds through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, Ig2 binds through ionic and hydrogen bonds, and Ig2 binds through hydrogen bonding. The unique properties on the concave surface are what determine which LAR-RPTP binds to it. If the proper LAR-RPTP is not bound to the LRR1 then synapse formation cannot occur, but bonding can still occur. Once they are bound properly, the complex is sufficient for synapse differentiation. Point mutations in the LRR1 region impaired differentiation as well but not binding.  Clinical significance  = Tourette syndrome = The SLITRK1 gene \\"is not a major risk gene for the majority of individuals\\" with Tourette syndrome (TS), according to a 2009 review, although its study can help contribute to our understanding of TS. Rare variants in SLITRK1 may lead to TS, and mutations in non-coding regions of SLITRK1 may also play a part, but further research needs to be done before any conclusions can be drawn. In 2005, medical researchers observed a de novo translocation on 13q in a patient with TS which broke the patient's chromosome near the SLITRK1 genome. In screening of additional patients, the authors observed a frameshift mutation in SLITRK1 in a patient with TS and the same rare ncRNA target variant (called var321 and varCDfs; target of miR-24-1) in two patients with TS. These variants were not found in several thousand controls supporting an association of the variants with TS. A subsequent examination of the region of the SLITRK1 gene found the mutation in none of 82 patients with Tourette syndrome. The authors concluded that tests to detect variant(s) in the gene probably would have little diagnostic utility. An experiment in the effects of a microdeletion in chromosome 13q31.1 was done in a fetus, the mother had passed the microdeletion to the child and both did not have tourettes or any other OCD symptoms, showing that it may not be a direct cause of tourettes. Further attempts to replicate the study were done in multiple studies. In a Japanese study, next-gen sequencing was used to screen 92 TS patients and 361 healthy controls, none of TS patients were found to have mutations at either variant or any new mutations in the gene. In a European study it was found that the 2 original variations were not found in any of the 222 trios that were studied. However, tests were also done on SNPs in the groups and 3 were found to have variations. Two of the three variations were found to be associated with the formation of Tourette syndrome. In a different study of 381 Caucasians with some form of OCD with 356 non-OCD control patients, 3 genetic changes were found after genetic screening. Of the 3, 2 were identified only once each and the third was found in 4 OCD patients but also in a non-OCD patient. The non-OCD patient did have compulsive nail biting, but these studies show that a genetic link between SLITRK1 and patients with TS may exist they are more complex in nature than previously understood. = Trichotillomania = The SLITRK1 gene has also been implicated in a small percentage of cases of trichotillomania, an impulse disorder in which individuals compulsively pull their own hair. In one of the previously mentioned studies the mother of the child who had a de novo translocation on 13q had trichotillomania; this would suggest that there could be a genetic link between SLITRK1 and trichotillomania as well. A study was done in which 44 families with individuals who had trichotillomania had their SLITRK1 gene sequenced. Two new non-synonymous mutations were discovered about 9 base pairs apart from each other, in an area separate from the one where the Tourette mutations were found. These results were compared to a control and none had the mutation, suggesting that these mutations, while rare, were associated with trichotillomania.

Tkach's wife, Yeroslava, was born in Slatchev, Poland, and entered the U.S. in 1913. The Tkachs lived in New York City from 1922 onwards. Tkach became a naturalized U. S. citizen in New York City on December 8, 1936. Tkach had long been active in the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and was editor of the Ukrainian Daily News, the leading Ukrainian Communist newspaper in the U.S. As early as 1923, under the name M.

Elizabeth Bentley told the FBI that in 1941 and 1942 Tkach had provided Jacob Golos with considerable information concerning the Ukrainian nationalism movement in the United States which Golos considered of great importance. Golos told Bentley much of the information was secured by Tkach from one W. J. Stepankowski, who for a time worked as an investigator for Golos. In July 1944 Tkach was elected president of the Ukrainian Section of the International Workers Order, a communist-affiliated insurance and fraternal order. The Ukraniain Daily News was by that time published by the Ukrainian Section of the IWO. Tkach supervised a small network of American communists working as agents of the Soviet Union.

S. Lewis. He is the main antagonist of The Last Battle, which is the last book of the series. Shift is an ape who, like many animals in Lewis' work, can talk; Lewis does not specify what kind of ape, but Pauline Baynes' illustrations depict him as a chimpanzee. At the beginning of the book, he lives near his friend/servant Puzzle the donkey at the base of the Great Waterfall, next to the Caldron Pool where the Great River starts its course to the sea. Lewis describes Shift as \\"the cleverest, ugliest, most wrinkled Ape you can imagine.\\" Name The name Shift can be viewed as a description of the character in the same manner as other characters in The Last Battle such as Jewel and Puzzle. In the case of Shift, his name picks up on the two themes of deception (shiftiness) and development (change/shift). Biographical summary =Prior story= Nothing is known of Shift's history before he appears in chapter 1 of The Last Battle. There Lewis says that he is so old that no one remembers when he came to live at the base of the great waterfall. After his demise it is suggested that he may have been a spy of the Tisroc for years before the lion skin arrives in chapter one and he had only been waiting for an opportunity to betray Narnia. =Character development= Throughout the book, Shift's greed and lust for power serve as his primary motivations. Shift's actions to satisfy his greed increase in vileness as the story progresses. From lying to his \\"friend\\" Puzzle, he moves to manipulating the other talking animals of Narnia by ways of outlandish lies and unruly decrees that largely benefit himself and the Calormene population. In the end he has no problem murdering them and selling them into slavery to increase his own wealth and power. As Shift's actions become increasingly evil, he also becomes increasingly human in his appearance and in the way he presents himself. He is very similar to Napoleon from Animal Farm. He dons human clothing and explains that he is not an ape, and that if he appears as one, it is only because he is \\"so very old: hundreds and hundreds of years old.\\" However, at this stage he takes to drinkLike Comrade Napoleon in Animal Farm. and becomes increasingly the spokesman of the Calormene captain Rishda Tarkaan, and the cunning cat Ginger. Shift gains the power to pursue these actions by tricking Puzzle into impersonating Aslan, the true leader of Narnia. Later, to secure the assistance of the neighboring country Calormen, he insists that their god Tash and Aslan are one and the same. But Shift's plans unravel when his actions unwittingly summon the real Tash into Narnia. Shift meets his end when he is thrown into the stable where Tash dwells by king Tirian to prove that Tash is in fact there, and is eaten by the monstrous god. Allegorical interpretations and literary references Lewis, himself an expert on allegory, did not consider The Chronicles of Narnia allegory. He saw them as \\"suppositional\\" answering the question, \\"What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.\\" As such, Narnia presents significant parallels with elements from Christianity. Shift is most often compared to the Antichrist from the biblical book of Book of Revelation. :Revelation 13:15 can be seen as a passable description of Shift's hold over the Narnians: \\"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.\\" Shift's ability to present his false Aslan is what compels the Narnians to obey him, and the Calormenes kill those who resist. A. N. Wilson and John GoldthwaiteThe Natural History of Make-Believe. both suggest that Shift is intended as a type of the Catholic Church, in keeping with the traditional Protestant identification of the Pope with Antichrist. This identification is based on Shift's claim that Aslan cannot be bothered with speaking to a lot of animals and that he, Shift, is hereafter Aslan's sole mouthpiece. Similarly John J. Miller, writing for National Review, says: \\"I find it hard to see the ape Shift in The Last Battle, for example, as anything other than a satire of Roman Catholicism in general and the papacy in particular.\\" . However, in Lewis' other writings it is made clear that he had no special animus against Roman CatholicismLetter to Bede Griffiths, \\"You, in your charity, are anxious to convert me: but I am not in the least anxious to convert you. You think my specifically Protestant beliefs a tissue of damnable errors: I think your specifically Catholic beliefs a mass of comparatively harmless human tradition which may be fatal to certain souls under special conditions, but which I think suitable for you‚Ä¶.\\" but detested theocracy in whatever form it might take.\\"A Reply to Professor Haldane\\", in Of This and Other Worlds, p. 105; \\"Lilies that Fester\\" in They Asked for a Paper, p. 112. In his Oxford History of English Literature in the Sixteenth Centuryp.444. he endorses Milton's view that Elizabethan Presbyterianism was just as guilty as Roman Catholicism of interposing a priestly mediator between man and God: for example, in their belief that the Bible should never be read out in churches but only \\"opened through preaching\\". The ape's claim that Aslan (God) is not bound by human standards of good and evil is also a Puritan rather than a Catholic trait.ibid. p. 449.

Biography  Arsen Bashirovich Kanokov is one of the most well-known today's political figures, a Doctor of Economics. He handles the post of The Head of Kabardino-Balkar Republic (KBR) since 2005 (re-elected in 2010). Arsen Kanokov was born on 22 February 1957 in a small village Sheethala of KBR. His parents were doing a simple labour: his father worked in a sovkhoz and his mother was a medical assistant. For 27 years father of a future-Head of the Republic had been working as a vegetable grower, only later having become an agronomist, then a head of the village soviet. Arsen Kanokov was studying in School ‚Ññ1 of Nartkala town, he graduated with a big success. Just after graduating he enters Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, proving himself as a talented student and fulfilling successfully his education in a capital university. After graduating from the university in 1984 Kanokov serves in Soviet Army. He gets demobilised in 1985, then begins working in Moscow fruit and vegetable association. Arsen Kanokov was working for four years in different branches of the association, receiving the shop manager's position in 1987. Same year Kanokov initiates the creation of a trade and purchase cooperation with a trade name of \\"Kodex\\". It gets re-organised to \\"Sindika\\" holding company in 1991. Its scope includes several spheres: bank operation and investments, building in Moscow and its region, multi-functional trade networks' management (including Arsen Bashirovich's native region of KBR). From 1994 to 1998 Arsen Kanakov is the holding's president. He proves himself as a talented organiser and professional manager. While working for \\"Sindika\\" Kanokov purchased 30% of ZAO \\"Centrocredit Bank\\" stock and entered the directors committee, where he remained till 2003. He successfully combined his activity of a manager with a banker's and political career ‚Äì in 1998 he became a permanent representative of KBR to Russian President. In 2003 Arsen Kanokov was elected as a deputy of the State Duma of Russian Federation. He became a \\"United Russia\\" party member in 2004. The experience he got throughout the years helped him in his political career ‚Äì after entering the party Kanokov becomes a vice-chairman in Russian Duma's committee corresponding to budget forming and tax regulation. In the meantime Arsen Kanokov is creating a strong relation with the science. He completed his PhD thesis in 1998 and obtained a doctor's degree in 2001. Arsen Kanokov leads the investigations, takes part in board of education's activity, becomes a member of Academy of natural sciences and of Academy of economical sciences and undertaking. =Arsen Kanokov's political career= Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin mentioned Kanokov's well-done work in Russian Federation and his activity in state economy. In September 2005 Putin nominates Kanokov as a new president of Kabardino-Balkar Republic. His candidature is supported with the Republic's Legislative Assembly. During Kanokov's presidency KBR becomes an economical leader of Northern Caucasus Region ‚Äì Kanokov has fully justified the given trust. Russian next President Dmitry Medvedev nominates Kanokov as a Head of the Republic in 2010 ‚Äì and he is again supported with the majority of the Legislative Assembly. In 2009 Kanokov is in the head of Russian Federation's list of persons to be elected to Russian Parliament. Yet he did not accept the deputy mandate, nor did he do it in 5th and 6th convocation of Duma (in 2007 and 2011). Arsen Kanokov is known as a generous sponsor and supporter. He used his personal savings to erect a temple and a mosque, as well as monuments; moreover he supported the restoration of a famous restaurant \\"Elbrus\\" and hotel \\"Intourist\\". The Head of Kabardino-Balkar Republic Arsen Kanokov provides a material assistance to charitable actions and events, he sponsors the families with many children and orphanage houses, also the football teams (including PFC Spartak Nalchik). He asserts that his wife and mother of his three children is a person who supported the future Head of the Republic during his whole long political career, including difficult situations and hard moments. Arsen Kanokov enjoys his electors' confidence, because his name is not sullied with a big scandal despite his big social position. =List of rewards= *2007: Reverend Sergius of Radonezh Order (2nd degree); *2008: Peter the Great Order (1st degree), golden badge \\"for peacemaking and charitable activity\\" ‚Äì the highest prize from the International Social Fund \\"Russian Fund of Peace\\"; *2009: \\"Slava Otechestva (\\"Valour of the Fatherland\\")\\" Order, a grand-prix nominee of \\"Person of the Year 2009\\" annual prize, founded by RBK. *2010: \\"In Remembrance of 30th Anniversary of Olympic Games in Moscow 1980\\" badge.

Previously signed to Interscope Records, she was voted one of NME's \\"50 Coolest People,\\" and has received major news coverage in NME, Spin, MTV News and Rolling Stone, among others. She started her own record label October 2012 launching Full Psycho Records, TV & Crafts in a soft launch. She is known for her quick- witted stage persona and retorts to insults (Hardy has said, \\"As long as I get the last laugh, I'm fine\\"), and for the explicit titles of some of her songs, such as \\"You Fuck Like My Dad\\" (which was shortened to \\"YFLMD\\") and \\"My Dick Sux\\" (though the lyrical content of the actual songs is not as blatantly explicit).  Early life  Hardy grew up mostly in San Clemente, a city in Orange County, California. Her mother is Molly Hardy, a part-time playwright and director. When Hardy was younger, she acted in one of her mother's plays. She got her first guitar when she was in the sixth grade, but attempts at getting lessons failed. In the tenth grade, Hardy went to a boarding school in Ojai of which she says, \\"There was nothing to do there. I was acting there and I was in the choir.\\" It was there that she met another girl who also had a guitar. According to Hardy, \\"Her Dad was teaching her Beatles songs. So we learned how to play together. I learned a lot by studying piano books that had chord charts. I bought some rock books. Around then I learned how to play and sing at the same time.\\" After high school, Hardy did extra work for money and pursued a musical career. In 1999, she moved to Los Angeles. At some point, Hardy worked as a DJ at Beauty Bar. Hardy continued looking for band members and was involved in many potential bands, including Mein Coif, with friends Mike Felix (now drummer of Toys That Kill) and Max Humphrey (bassist of The Adored). Giant Drag In May 2003, Hardy and Micah Calabrese formed Giant Drag. Hardy's mother, who had worked with Calabrese, had initially attempted to get Hardy and Calabrese to meet, but the two eventually met through mutual friends. They began recording music together, including covers of Journey's \\"Who's Crying Now\\" and the Beach Boys' \\"God Only Knows.\\" According to Hardy, \\"One day I said, 'Hey dude, you know all my songs. Why don't you be my drummer?' He agreed.\\" They considered looking for a bass player, until Calabrese began playing bass parts on a synthesizer with his left hand while playing drums with his right as a joke. Hardy and Calabrese decided that Calabrese would continue to do this from that point on. Giant Drag's first show was on June 4, 2003, at the Scene in Los Angeles, one month after they decided to be a band. They went on to play venues like The Troubadour, Silverlake Lounge, The Fold and The Derby. On January 25, 2005, Giant Drag released the EP Lemona on Wichita Recordings. This was followed on September 13, 2005, by their first full-length release, Hearts and Unicorns, on Kickball Records. In December 2008, NME announced that she was suffering from fibromyalgia. The Swan Song EP was released on February 16, 2010. Acting and TV appearances In February 2010, she made her screen debut in a short film by Spike Jonze. In October 2011, Annie made a musical appearance on the 2011 Halloween episode Pretty Little Liars. Other works Annie Hardy frequently co-hosted the Get The Fuck Up GTFU radio show with Jeremy Weiss and Aaron Farley. On January 4, 2007, Hardy announced on Giant Drag's official website that she will be recording a cover of Madonna's \\"Oh Father\\" for a charity/tribute Madonna album that will benefit AIDS in Africa tentatively titled \\"Through The Wilderness.\\" Giant Drag's cover of \\"Wicked Game\\" by Chris Isaak was used in a commercial for Nip/Tuck on the FX Network. Giant Drag originals have been featured on television shows including The L-Word, Jericho and the movie A Love Song for Bobby Long starring Scarlett Johansson and John Travolta. Hardy will release her debut solo album \\"Rules\\" on April 7, 2017. Collaborations and relationships Hardy started her own record label, TV network and crafts business called \\"Full Psycho: Records. TV. Crafts.\\" with bands such as The Icarus Line collaborating with her again. Hardy provided guest vocals on the song \\"Pink Cellphone\\" from the 2006 Deftones album Saturday Night Wrist. On April 26, 2007, Hardy performed the song \\"Just Like Honey\\" onstage with The Jesus and Mary Chain for their reunion show the day before Coachella. Annie contributed vocals to The Icarus Line's 2010 record Wildlife and performed a number of the band's live appearances on organ. She also appeared at the debut live performance of Crosses (featuring Deftones singer and guitarist Chino Moreno) in Pomona, CA, performing the Giant Drag song \\"Swan Song\\". Personal life In March 2015, she gave birth to a son named Silvio with a rapper Cadalack Ron. Silvio died at the age of 17 days of SIDS. Cadalack Ron died of a drug overdose in January 2016.

The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the Indian Parliament in December 1956 with the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, which took effect beginning 1 October 1958. The Indian Coinage Act was passed in 1955 by the Government of India to introduce decimal coinage in the country. The new system of coins became legal tender on April 1957, where the rupee consists of 100 paise. For the next five years, both the old and new systems were legal. In April 1962, all other systems were banned. This process of metrication is called \\"big-bang\\" route, which is to simultaneously outlaw the use of pre-metric measurement, metricate, reissue all government publications and laws, and change the education systems to metric. India's conversion was quicker than that of many other countries, including its coloniser, the United Kingdom. This was helped by low popular literacy and the fact that there was previously no nationwide standard measurement system‚ÄîBritish imperial units were used by the upper class, while various regional systems were used by the poor. The Indian model was extremely successful and served later as a model for metrication in various African and Asian countries. The National Physical Laboratory of India, located in New Delhi, is designated the maintainer of SI units in India. It also calibrates the national standards of weights and measures.  History  Before metrication, the government of India followed the Indian Weights and Measures Act passed in 1870 which used the British imperial system. However, many other indigenous systems were in use in other parts of the country and this was a constant problem with government officials and the public at large. P. N. Seth was the founder and secretary of the Indian Decimal Society, whose aim it was to push for the introduction of the metric system in India. P. N. Seth was assisted by others in the society, such as professors Dr H. L. Roy, Dr S. K. Mitra, and P. C. Mahalanobis, and other leading Indian scientists. Since 1930, they advocated for discarding the old chaotic system by writing in newspapers, journals, participating in debates and distributing literature. During the post-WWII interim government, there were attempts to introduce some standardisation in weights and measures but the conservative section of the ruling party never allowed it to be passed. Then, outstanding scientific personalities and public figures were mobilised by the Indian Decimal Society. P. N. Seth put forward a scheme for metrication of currency on 17 January 1944, which was finally adopted in the Indian Parliament in 1955.  Common usage today  Today all official measurements are made in the metric system. However, in common usage some older Indians may still refer to imperial units. Some measurements, such as the heights of mountains, are still recorded in feet. Additionally, the Indian numbering system of crores and lakhs are used, while tyre rim diameters are still measured in inches, as used worldwide. Road widths are popularly measured in feet but official documents use metres. Body temperature is still sometimes measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Industries like the construction and the real estate industry still use both the metric and the imperial system, though it is more common for sizes of homes to be given in square feet and land in acres. Bulk cotton is sold by the candy (0.35 imperial tons, or 355.62 kg) or the bale (170 kg). Fruits are sold by kilograms or dozens. The Delhi Jal Board uses MGD (million gallons daily) for water supply measurements. The motor industry still uses brake horsepower (bhp) for engine power. The Indian Boiler Act mentions five gallons as 22.75 litres. Tyre tubes and carbonated beverages are filled on the psi scale. Clothing sizes are given in an even numbers of inches. Shoes sizes increment by one-third of an inch. Football pitches are measured along the ground in yards and height in feet. Ladders are sold per foot.

Longshaw obtained medical and pharmacy training in Boston, New York City, and New Orleans, receiving his medical degree from the University of Michigan. He was appointed acting assistant surgeon by the navy in 1862, serving aboard , , , , and finally his squadron's flagship . On several occasions Longshaw's gallantry and courageous actions under direct enemy fire were mentioned in reports by flag-level superiors like Rear Admirals John Dahlgren and David Dixon Porter and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Wells. Supporting the navy's amphibious landing in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher on January 15, 1865, Longshaw went onshore with the landing party and was active in tending to numerous wounded and dying during the assault. After rescuing an unconscious sailor in danger of drowning from the rising tide, Longshaw responded to the cry of a wounded marine and while treating him was shot in the head and died instantly. After a 1913 plea for recognition by United States Navy medical director James Duncan Gatewood, in 1943 the navy commissioned a named in honor of the assistant surgeon. That vessel was lost to shore battery fire in the Battle of Okinawa and received nine battle stars for its World War II service. Early life and training William Longshaw was born in Manchester, Virginia in April 1839 , the eldest of two sons to parents William and Margaret (n√©e Davies) Longshaw who had emigrated to the United States from England shortly after marriage. The Longshaws traveled to Kentucky for a time then settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts; William's younger brother Luther M. (July 31, 1844 - May 27, 1921) was born in Lowell. William appears to have attended Lyman school and the English High School, completing his studies at Phillips Academy. At the age of 16, Longshaw began to actively study medicine with an East Cambridge physician for a year, then moved to New York where he attended lectures at University of the City of New York (now New York University) under Valentine Mott and Thomas C. Finnell. At the age of 18, Longshaw traveled to New Orleans, working as a pharmacy clerk, and attending lectures in pharmacology at University of Louisiana (now Tulane University). By 1858, he was sufficiently accomplished as a pharmacist to become a member of the American Pharmaceutical Association. In 1858, while still in New Orleans, Longshaw assisted the local medical community in combating a summer Yellow fever epidemic. After further study at University of Michigan Medical School Longshaw received his medical degree in 1859. His handwritten graduation thesis, still in the Michigan Historical Collections, is entitled \\"The Physiology of Fecundation\\". As a student, Longshaw was a clinical assistant to the professor of surgery; he was also granted \\"a special degree in chemistry, both qualitative and quantitative analysis.\\" After obtaining his degree, Longshaw gained experience taking \\"charge of four wards of an Army hospital.\\" On July 10, 1860, Longshaw embarked as surgeon of the polar expedition led by Isaac Israel Hayes which wintered that year on Ellesmere Island; Longshaw himself returned in November 1860, reporting temporary snow blindness. He reported that he and another crewman had witnessed a solar eclipse which occurred on July 18. Naval service =USS Yankee= Entering the Navy as an acting assistant surgeon June 25, 1862, Longshaw was described as a slim, fair-skinned fellow of average height with dark hair and gray eyes. Longshaw was assigned to , an armed paddle wheel tugboat which had seen action in Charleston Harbor, the evacuation of the Norfolk Naval Yard, and in the Potomac River basin. While Longshaw was in service on Yankee, the little gunboat served on the James River flotilla, supporting McClellan's Peninsula campaign. In July, Longshaw participated in a nighttime raid that captured two ships without firing a shot. In August 1862 Yankee returned to the Potomac to guard approaches to the nation's capitol. On August 14, Longshaw reported to the Philadelphia Naval Asylum for board examinations. Passing the Naval Medical Board examinations required not only a thorough medical knowledge of fields such as chemistry, anatomy, physiology, obstetrics and \\"principles and practice of surgery\\", but also a test of the candidate's \\"mental, moral and physical qualifications\\" necessary for arduous sea duty. Longshaw passed with 595 out of a possible 780 (76.2%) in about three days of testing. Still only an acting assistant surgeon, Longshaw returned to Yankee, serving until mid- October. =Boston Navy Yard= Longshaw was finally appointed assistant surgeon in November 1862 and was transferred to the receiving ship at Boston Harbor, waiting orders and assignment to his next vessel. Until March, Longshaw served as a medical officer of the Boston Navy Yard, where he would perform physical inspections of new recruits, returning sailors and officers, as well as treating injuries and illnesses of those in his charge. Ohio was a retired ship of the line, now in ordinary, designed for a crew of several hundred men, now serving as a barracks and hospital for the navy yard. After six years of medical training, Longshaw was stationed within a short hike from his parents' home in Cambridge. Aboard such a training vessel, Longshaw learned to spend his day writing and filing reports on individual cases, logging traffic through the sick bay, keeping inventory of equipment and supplies, making requests for medications, taking environmental readings, inspecting various locations about the ship for sanitary conditions, coordinating with the ship's galley to insure sufficient nourishment, in addition to dealing with the daily medical needs of the crew. An assistant surgeon would also train new sailors in basic first aid, teaching them how to apply tourniquets and bandages, then how to load, lift and carry wounded comrades on stretchers. Longshaw would be responsible for managing medical and other hospital staff like nurses, cooks, and stewards. Five months aboard Ohio provided Longshaw his naval \\"residency.\\" =USS Passaic= In March 1863, Longshaw was assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Samuel Francis Du Pont in Charleston Harbor. Longshaw's new vessel was , much like her predecessor , a shallow-draft, low-profile ironclad with a single raised turret in the center of the deck. Passaic was under the command of Captain Percival Drayton, a native of Charleston, and while newly commissioned and modern, Passaic was vulnerable to poor weather and rough seas. Her 85 sailors and officers were confined in her iron hull most of each day, cramped together and half-smothered by heat, smoke and foul air. In early April, Passaic and much of her squadron's ironclads attacked forts in Charleston Harbor. The ships were pounded by shot and shell. In a few hours, Passaic fired 13 shells and was struck 35 times, shots disabling one of its two guns, jamming its turret for a time and virtually ripping off the pilot-house atop the turret. However, Passaic suffered no casualties; only one death was recorded in the nine ironclads that day. =USS Penobscot= Longshaw was transferred in May 1863 to , a two-masted single-screw schooner tasked with chasing and capturing blockade runners. After months practicing medicine in a cramped, iron-hulled vessel with no windows, sunny Penobscot would have been a welcome change. In July, she ran an English-built Kate aground on Smith's Island; a boat party attempted to disable the vessel and actually set the blockade runner afire. =USS Lehigh= On August 11, Longshaw was ordered to return to ironclad service on the newly built monitor , a sister ship of Passaic, under the command of Commander Andrew Bryson. Lehigh was immediately engaged in active operations in Charleston Harbor, attacking Fort Sumter regularly for the next few months. In an engagement with Confederate batteries on Sullivan's Island, Charleston, South Carolina, November 16, 1863, Lehigh grounded itself while shelling Confederate forts in the harbor; a tow hawser had to be passed to steamer , which was standing by. Dr. Longshaw, under direct enemy fire in an open boat, twice carried a line for the hawser across to Nahant. The Confederate fire was so intense that both hawsers were shot away. Longshaw was unable to make the third trip; by then he had wounded officers and men to attend. Lehigh was eventually refloated when Nahant pulled her free with the third hawser. Five seaman were promoted and eventually awarded the Medal of Honor for the action. Longshaw's gallantry in this action was praised by eyewitness Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren. Wrote Dahlgren: \\"Twice he passed in a small boat from the Lehigh to the Nahant, carrying a line bent on the hawser. The shot and shell from cannon and mortars were flying and breaking all around.\\" Dalhgren reported he'd promoted the enlisted men involved. \\"I shall also make honorable mention of them to the honorable Secretary of the Navy, which is all I can do for Dr. Longshaw. It is not in my power to reward him suitably.\\" Longshaw's status as medical officer prevented Dahlgren from offering him a field promotion. However, the navy's chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery sent his recommendation to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles who did promote Longshaw, pending board examinations and completion of two years' service. =USS Minnesota= Longshaw was transferred to Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee's North Atlantic Blockading fleet on December 30, 1863, and was assigned to the squadron flagship Minnesota, Lieutenant Commander John H. Upshur commanding. Longshaw's new assignment was prestigious; he would serve under the fleet surgeon with three other assistant surgeons aboard. With ship's officers and enlisted men numbering almost 700, Minnesota was massive, well-equipped, and \\"one of the great frigates of her day... Such ships were the best habitations afloat...\\" Assisting the fleet surgeon would involve facilitating the vast flow of reports, logs, inventories, requests, and receipts from each vessel in the fleet. Longshaw and the other assistant surgeons aboard would help accumulate data for constant communication with the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in the Department of the Navy. Longshaw would stand watches as officer of the day supervising the sick bay, diagnosing and treating injuries and illnesses as they arose. Fort Fisher By the end of 1864, Wilmington, North Carolina was one of the few ports still available for blockade runners attempting to supply the Confederacy. The presence of shoal waters prevented larger ships from entering Cape Fear River, and the Confederates had built a substantial series of fortifications on what was then known as Federal Point. The largest of these was Fort Fisher. Facing the sea was a twelve-foot high structure one mile long, with raised batteries at each end; facing the northern land approach was a taller structure with fifteen mounds 32 feet high, an underground network of tunnels, and a stake fence nine feet high in front of the walls. The structure's sturdy earthen construction rendered much of the fort impervious to naval artillery bombardment. A garrison of 2400 soldiers, good supply lines, and strong artillery positions made the fort difficult to assault by land. In late December, a land attack on the fort failed, causing the removal of the Union forces' commander. Another more coordinated assault was planned for January. The fort was to face massive bombardment from the sea, followed by a land assault from the north, timed to coincide with amphibious landing by 400 marines and 1600 sailors from the northeast. For the naval assault Minnesota would supply 51 marines, 189 sailors and officers, and Longshaw. Marines were armed with rifles; sailors with cutlass and pistols. Longshaw carried his medical bag. The naval assault bogged down; the fort's walls were out of range of the sailors' pistols. Hundreds of marines and sailors were killed or wounded. One officer reported of Longshaw, \\"he was always near the front with instruments and tourniquets...\\". Another officer reported of \\"his great bravery and attention to the wounded under the hottest fire...\\". Thomas O. Selfridge, later recorded: The next day, North Atlantic Blockading Squadron commanding officer Rear Admiral David D. Porter ordered to pick up Dr. Longshaw's body from Minnesota and to deliver it to the naval hospital at Gosport Navy Yard \\"without delay.\\" Legacy Dr. William Longshaw Jr. was buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, Massachusetts. In 1943, the destroyer was named in his honor.

He played for Norwegian Premier League clubs Skeid, Moss, Rosenborg and Fredrikstad. In 2005, he broke his neck during a match, which left him paralyzed from the chest down. He has since regained partial movement in his arms and legs, and has several times stated his intentions to walk again.  Career  Enerly grew up in Ammerud on Oslo's east side, and started his career for local clubs Grorud and later Grei. He then went to the Oslo- club Skeid and with them got his debut in the Norwegian Premier League in 1996. Enerly usually played on the right wing. His key attributes as a player were good pace, good technique and an excellent long-range shot. When Skeid were relegated in 1997, he went to Moss, where he played for three seasons before being signed by champions Rosenborg. Enerly spent three and a half seasons in Rosenborg, winning the League three times. After getting limited playing time in his final season at Rosenborg, he joined Fredrikstad halfway through the 2004 season, where his experience quickly made him an important player and he became team captain. = Neck injury and retirement = On 29 October 2005, in the last round of the 2005 season, Fredrikstad faced league leaders Start, away in Kristiansand struggling to avoid relegation. Fredrikstad won the match 3‚Äì1, which meant that Fredrikstad stayed up. However, just five minutes into the game, Enerly collided with a teammate, and fell to the ground with his teammate falling on top of him. Enerly was unable to get up or even move a muscle, and medical personnel rushed to his aid carried him off on a stretcher, wearing a neck brace. Later that evening it was announced that Enerly, who had been sent to Oslo's Ullev√•l Hospital for surgery, had broken his neck and was quadriplegic. The news of the injury shocked all of Norway and overshadowed all the football-related events around the country. In the days that followed, Enerly received well-wishings from every walk of life in Norway, and even from the stars of Real Madrid who were visiting Norway for a Champions League match against Rosenborg.Aftonbladet: Ra√∫l wishes Enerly a speedy recovery In the days following the accident, a massive SMS campaign was created getting people to light a candle in their window at 8:00 in the evening (Enerly's shirt number was #8). In January 2006 it was reported that Enerly had regained some movement in his arms, but that his legs are still paralysed, and in December 2006 it was reported that he has regained movement and strength in his left arm, and some in his right arm (able to lift up to 4 kg). As of December 2011, Enerly is still confined to an electric wheelchair, but he confirmed to Norwegian newspapers that he had stood upright on his own feet for the first time since the accident during a training session in a therapeutic pool. He stood on his own feet in the pool, supporting his own weight, for fifteen seconds. As Fredrikstad F.K. were celebrating their Norwegian Cup victory in 2006 at Ullevaal Stadion, Enerly was brought onto the pitch to celebrate with the players, as a gesture for his involvement in the club even after his injury. In August 2007, it was announced that FFK will retire his jersey No. 8. On 8 September. Dagfinn Enerly and Tor Trondsen held a testimonial match for Knut Thorbj√∏rn Eggen. Team Eggen vs Team RBK. Team Eggen was formed by Enerly, and the players were earlier football players from FFK and other players Eggen has trained. Team RBK was \\"old\\" boys from the early RBK. At team Eggen ‚Äì Enerly was captain. He played in the way he could. That was a comeback. He scored a goal. He played it in his wheelchair to big applause from the audience.  International  He made two appearances for the Norwegian national team, the first in a 1996 friendly against Georgia (as substitute for Jan √Öge Fj√∏rtoft), and the second in a 2001 friendly against South Korea. He was also a national team regular in football tennis.  Personal  Enerly is married and has twin daughters (born 28 October 2003).

It is a film adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel of the same name. It was directed by Roland Joff√© and stars Demi Moore, Gary Oldman, and Robert Duvall. This version was \\"freely adapted\\" from Hawthorne and deviated from the original story. A critical and box office failure, it was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards at the 1995 ceremony, winning \\"Worst Remake or Sequel.\\" Plot It is 1667 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and an uneasy truce exists between local Puritans and their neighbors, the Algonquian. Chief Metacomet succeeds his father Massasoit as head of the latter just as a new colonist, Hester Prynne arrives overseas from England. As Hester waits for her husband‚Äîwho is due to follow shortly after‚Äîshe falls for a young minister, Arthur Dimmesdale. When it emerges that Roger Prynne has likely been killed by Native Americans, they become inseparable lovers. Finding herself pregnant with Dimmesdale's child, Hester is imprisoned for her indiscretion. The minister intends to declare his sin and face execution, but Hester convinces him otherwise. Sentenced to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" for adultery, Prynne is ostracized by the public, and a drummer boy is charged to follow her whenever she comes to town. Meanwhile, Hester's husband resurfaces, having spent his absence in captivity as a prisoner of war. Learning of the scandal, he adopts the fictitious guise of \\"Dr. Roger Chillingworth\\" and begins seeking out her paramour. The physician eventually murders a male settler leaving Hester's home and scalps him in an effort to implicate Algonquian warriors. Infuriated by this atrocity, the colonists declare war on the Indians and Roger, distraught by the severe consequences of his action, promptly commits suicide. Hester is nearly hanged with other undesirables in the ensuing outrage, but Dimmesdale saves her neck by confessing that he is the father of her child. As he takes her place on the gallows, the Algonquian attack Massachusetts Bay; both sides sustain heavy casualties. The Puritans are more concerned with concealing the conflict from England than harassing Hester any further; she finally abandons her scarlet letter and departs with Dimmesdale for Carolina.

The film was shot in British Columbia on Vancouver Island, in and around Campbell River (Beaverlodge Lands‚Äînow Rockland Road and North Island College/Timberline Secondary, Lupin Falls and Myra Falls in Strathcona Provincial Park, Little Oyster River, and White River), and in the Nova Scotia towns of Yarmouth, Shelburne, and in the small village of Saint Alphonse in Clare in 1994. In Shelburne, the waterfront area was substantially altered to resemble a Puritan New England town in the mid-17th century. Some of the buildings on Dock Street retain the grey-tone paint finishes used for the film. Score Three original scores were written for this film. The first score was composed by Ennio Morricone and was quickly rejected. A second score was composed by Elmer Bernstein, but his music was set aside in lieu of the final score, composed by John Barry. Reportedly, star Demi Moore wanted a score by Barry from the start, so Morricone's and Bernstein's music were not going to be accepted, regardless of quality. Barry's score was released on CD by Sony Records upon the film's release in 1995. A CD of Bernstein's rejected score was released by Var√®se Sarabande in 2008. No recordings of Morricone's score have been released to the public. Reception The Scarlet Letter was thoroughly panned by critics. Based on 38 reviews collected by aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 13% approval rating, with an average score of 3/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"The Scarlet Letter strays far from its classic source material to tell a story that strains for steamy sensuality and leaves the audience red with unintentional laughter.\\" In Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman referred to a \\"clunky, dawdlingly literal-minded Scarlet Letter, a movie that doesn't so much adapt the book as give it an expensive makeover.\\" Kevin Williamson of National Review, in a retrospective appraisal, declared it \\"the worst film ever made\\", adding: \\"With its combination of awfulness and inexplicability, it's the 'MacArthur Park' of cinema.\\" The film won Worst Remake or Sequel at the 1995 Golden Raspberry Awards, receiving further nominations for Worst Actress (Moore), Worst Supporting Actor (Duvall), Worst Screen Couple (Moore and either Duvall or Oldman), Worst Director, Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. It grossed $10.3 million against a production budget of $46 million. In response to the criticism, and to the new ending, Moore said that the story the filmmakers were trying to tell differed out of necessity with that of the book, which she said was \\"very dense and not cinematic\\". She noted the original story might be better suited to a miniseries on television, and that the story presented in this film needed a different ending, one that did not lose \\"the ultimate message of Hester Prynne\\" that its makers were trying to convey. Asked by critic Peter Travers in 2011 to name the few films in his catalogue that he would take to a desert island, Oldman named The Scarlet Letter among his four choices. He conceded Travers's assertion that the film was \\"hammered\\" by reviewers, but argued, \\"There's some good work in there.\\" See also *The Scarlet Letter ‚Äì the original novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne *Easy A References ;Notes ;Citations External links  * San Francisco Chronicle review * Reading Hawthorne in a gender-biased academy (refers to this film version) Category:1995 films Category:1990s romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Roland Joff√© Category:Films based on The Scarlet Letter Category:Films produced by Andrew G.

He is also mentioned in the companion book Oz: Behind These Walls: The Journal of Augustus Hill. Character overview \\"Prisoner #98P284. Convicted July 1, 1998 - Murder in the first degree. Sentence: Life imprisonment, up for parole in 60 years. Convicted in 2002 of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death.\\" Cyril was a hoodlum like his brother Ryan (who is actually his half-brother, as was revealed by Suzanne Fitzgerald). Cyril was Ryan's lieutenant and bodyguard in the Bridge Street Gang until he was injured in a fight, suffering brain damage. In the second season of Oz, Cyril murders the husband of Dr. Gloria Nathan on orders from his brother, who is in love with Dr. Nathan. Arriving in prison, Cyril is originally housed with Vernon Schillinger, head of the Aryan Brotherhood. After Schillinger rapes Cyril, however, Ryan gets his brother transferred to his own cell. In the last season of the show, Cyril is executed despite Ryan's multiple attempts to save his brother, and despite Cyril's intellectual disability. Although Cyril is normally placid, he is prone to violent attacks on people when enraged, often showing great strength, which has earned him the resentment, but also the respect, of many inmates. Fictional history =Season 2= Cyril O'Reily is the mentally handicapped brother of Ryan O'Reily, an Irish American sociopath serving time in Oz. He first appears when Ryan has surgery for breast cancer. Cyril is upset because their mother had died of cancer. After recovering, Ryan falls in love with Dr. Gloria Nathan, the prison doctor who helped save his life. Ryan feels that the only thing preventing a potential relationship with her is her husband, Preston, so he asks Cyril to murder him. Cyril does as he's told, and is sentenced to life in prison. Although Cyril is mentally disabled, he knows enough not to implicate Ryan in the crime as he worships his brother. Dr. Nathan and Unit Manager Tim McManus know that Ryan is responsible and demand that he confess, but Ryan says nothing and Cyril arrives in Oz. When Cyril arrives in Oz he is put in Unit B, where he is approached by Aryan leader Vernon Schillinger, who promises to take Cyril to see Ryan. Schillinger instead takes him to a storage closet where he is gang raped by Schillinger and the other members of the Aryan Brotherhood. When Ryan realizes what has happened, he orders Cyril to assault him and as Ryan is hit, Officer Joseph Mineo takes Cyril to Ad Seg, isolated but safely away from Schillinger. Ryan cajoles McManus to bring his brother to Em City, but McManus refuses the move unless Ryan confesses to ordering his brother to kill Preston Nathan. After his release Cyril suffers terrible flashbacks and nightmares of being raped by Schillinger. Later, a guard Eugene Rivera is blinded and needs a blood transfusion, and Ryan is the only person among both the inmates and officers with the same blood type. Ryan refuses to donate his blood unless his brother is moved to Em City. McManus arranges the transfer. Later, upon considering what Cyril's life in prison would be like without his brother to protect him, Ryan finally confesses to orchestrating the murder of Preston. Ryan's parole date is set back 40 years, but he can still protect Cyril from the other inmates, especially Schillinger. =Season 3= Cyril starts off this season working in the kitchen and essentially shadowing his brother. The Aryan inmates, especially Schillinger and James Robson, taunt Cyril and Ryan continuously over the rape he suffered at Schillinger's hands. Ryan wants to kill Schillinger, but does not get a chance. Cyril goes to work early one day, against Ryan's wishes, and Robson tries to rape him. Cyril fights back, seriously hurting his would-be assailant. McManus wants to put Cyril in isolation, but new head CO Sean Murphy suggests that Cyril be let off with a warning. Murphy is Black Irish like the O'Reily brothers and understands that Ryan is trying to protect him. Murphy also helps McManus start the prison boxing tournament where each competitor represents one prison group. Ryan enrolls Cyril, who used to box before his injury, in the tournament to show everyone in Oz that Cyril is physically powerful. In the first round, Cyril goes up against Robson. Ryan spikes Robson's water with drugs to ensure victory. Cyril wins the first fight against Robson in a knockout, and the Aryans leave off their taunts and threats afterward. Ryan spikes other boxer's drinks as well, as there is a lot of gambling money to be won. Ryan sees another opportunity to get back at the Aryans when Schillinger's heroin-addicted son Andrew arrives in Oz. Ryan, along with Cyril, Chris Keller and Tobias Beecher, who all have a vendetta against Schillinger, devise a plan to turn father against son. With Cyril as his bodyguard, Ryan sells drugs to Andrew then cuts him off, telling him that the only way he can buy drugs from now on is through the non-white inmates, something that the Aryan Brotherhood prohibits. Andrew eventually turns against his father, who bribes the guards to give him enough heroin to overdose. Cyril then fights in round two of the boxing tournament against Italian inmate Chucky Pancamo. Pancamo is the favorite to win, as he has more than 60 pounds on Cyril and is one of the most physically imposing inmates in Oz. Ryan spikes Pancamo's water, leading to a victory for Cyril, to the shock of the prison population. Cyril is now in the championship round and must face Hamid Khan. Warden Glynn postpones the fight indefinitely, due to the racial tension that is building between Oz inmates, mainly between the Black Muslim and White Aryan inmates. Ryan and Khan convince Glynn to allow the fight, but Glynn stipulates that there would be no audience. Khan is encouraged by all the black inmates to kill Cyril while Cyril is encouraged to kill Khan by all the white inmates. In the meantime, Murphy discovers that Ryan has been spiking the fighters' water and threatens to expose him if he spikes Hamid Khan's water. Desperate to find a way to beat Khan, Ryan calls in their father, Seamus, whom he and Cyril despise, as a way to anger Cyril into a violent frenzy. Ryan then tells Cyril to use that anger to beat Khan who, like Pancamo, is an easy favorite. Cyril imagines Khan is their father and beats him into a coma. Cyril feels bad about hurting Khan, but Ryan tells him that it was necessary to survive inside Oz. Khan is hooked up to life support which creates animosity among the black inmates and ratchets the racial tension up to an all-time high. A near race riot breaks out, and Oz is locked down. Khan dies after his wife wins a lawsuit to take him off of life support. =Season 4 Part I= The lockdown ends and Cyril is having nightmares over Khan's death. Ryan suggests psychotherapy with prison psychologist \\"Sister Pete\\" Reimondo, who thinks interaction sessions with the families of Cyril's murder victims is the best way to clear his conscience. The only family willing to participate in the interaction sessions is the Nathan family. Sister Pete demands that Ryan participate as well, as he ordered Preston's murder. In the interaction sessions, Cyril expresses his remorse and the Nathan parents express their anger. Ryan, however, turns the tables on the Nathans when he suggests that Gloria Nathan cheated on her husband during a temporary separation. As a result, the relationship between Dr. Nathan and Ryan becomes increasingly hostile. In Em City, Cyril is later attacked by inmates Leroy Tidd and Mondo Browne, who threaten to rape him. Cyril, however, beats the both of them and is then sedated with a large dose of Haldol by an angry Dr. Nathan. Ryan and Simon Adebisi, the leader of the Homeboys, then warn Tidd and Browne to stay away from Cyril. Dr. Nathan is raped in the meantime and she believes Ryan is responsible, punishing him by cutting off Cyril's treatment. With the help of Sister Pete, Ryan convinces Dr. Nathan that he wasn't responsible, and as a result she resumes Cyril's treatment. In the midst of this, Em City is undergoing a demographic shift that worries Ryan, Chris Keller and some other white inmates. The new unit manager, Martin Querns, an African American, has empowered the Homeboys to do whatever they wish in exchange for enforcing a state of non-violence in Em City. Consequently, more and more black inmates and guards are transferred in, replacing their white and Latino counterparts. Claire Howell, one of the few white officers left, then develops a sexual relationship with Ryan which is discovered by Cyril. Concerned that Cyril will talk, Ryan brings Cyril to Sister Pete for counseling, telling her Cyril is \\"seeing things\\". Meanwhile, Ryan and Keller murder two inmates as a means of getting Querns fired and McManus reinstated. With the help of Muslim leader Kareem Said, they obtain videotaped evidence showing the prohibited behavior that the Homeboys are being allowed to commit, forcing Warden Glynn to fire Querns. =Season 4 Part II= In this half of the season, Cyril's violent behavior begins to worry the staff. First, reporter Jack Eldridge comes to Oz to do a news story. When Cyril and Ryan were younger, Eldridge wrote a story on Irish street gangs which depicted the O'Reily's gang as brutal and heartless. The story angered their mother Tess, who died of cancer shortly afterwards. Cyril recalls the incident and beats Eldridge severely; the story is subsequently quashed. After Asian inmate Jia Kenmin arrives in Oz, disputes erupt between him and both the Irish and Latino factions. Kenmin provokes Cyril and Ryan to the point where Cyril loses control, beating the Asian man into a coma. McManus, angry and alarmed, considers transferring Cyril to the Connolly institute for the Mentally Unstable. Sister Pete, however, pushes him to send Cyril to Protective Custody for a while so that he can calm down. Back in Em City, Ryan and new inmate Padraig Connolly, an IRA member awaiting deportation, plan to blow up Oz. The bomb is a dud, but Ryan leaves the gas leaking in the cafeteria which eventually detonates, destroying both Emerald City and the cafeteria. Throughout the season, as Dr. Nathan finally falls for Ryan, she becomes somewhat more forgiving towards Cyril for killing her husband. =Season 5= Ryan's birth mother Suzanne Fitzgerald turned herself in after being on the run with a radical group for more than 30 years. Governor Devlin however reduces her charges to 2 years of community service at Oz where she can see Ryan and Cyril. While Cyril was in Protective Custody, it was determined that he and Ryan were half-siblings with different mothers but Ryan and Suzanne keep this secret from him. They enjoy seeing her on a daily basis but this is short lived when Jia Kenmin and new Asian inmate Li Chen attend some of the performing arts classes. Jia offers peace to the two of them which Cyril accepts but Ryan remains cautious about. In an attempt to set up the O'Reily brothers, Kenmin pays inmate Glen Shupe to tell Ryan that Chen plans to rape Suzanne and as a result, he and Cyril attack Jia. Cyril picks up a knife from the two Asians during the fight and stabs Li Chen to death defending Ryan. Furious, Tim McManus sends Ryan to the cage and Cyril to solitary but not before stating that Cyril will either be sent to the insane asylum or death row as he is growing tired of Cyril's behavior. As Ryan is in the common room cage, Kenmin informs him it was a set up in order to eliminate the two brothers. On trial for murder, Cyril is represented by Katherine McClain who claims that she will do everything she can for Cyril but does not seem to be the best lawyer for this case. In a meeting with other family members to raise money for a better lawyer, Ryan, their Aunt Brenda, Suzanne, and abusive father Seamus decide that Cyril is better off dying than staying the rest of his life in Oz or a mental institution. A new inmate, Father Daniel Meehan, offers to help and riles up Sister Pete and some anti-death penalty activists to protest that sentencing a man in Cyril's mental state to death is cruel and unusual. Meanwhile, Ryan exacts revenge by getting the Latinos to injure Glen Shupe and manipulating the COs to kill Jia Kenmin. Cyril's trial does not go well and he is found guilty of murder in the first degree. When being transferred to Death Row, Cyril attacks Officer Len Lopresti and is then sedated by three additional COs. After a long talk with Father Meehan, Ryan finally agrees to protest Cyril's death by any means necessary. =Season 6= In effort to overturn Cyril's death sentence Ryan, with the help of Sister Pete and Father Daniel Meehan, gets activist attorney Arnold Zelman to appeal his case. The appeals remonstrating the state's decision to kill a mentally handicapped person gather public support. In the meantime Sister Pete gives Cyril a hand puppet named Jericho whom Cyril speaks through with all his darker hidden thoughts. While speaking as Jericho, he uses his voice as it was before he became brain damaged rather than his present voice. In light of this disturbing behavior, Jericho is taken away from Cyril, who begins sobbing uncontrollably over the loss of his hand puppet. Cyril's crying angers Officer Lopresti, the supervising officer on death row who, with the other COs, spray Cyril down with a fire hose to shut him up. In the meantime, Governor Devlin, in an attempt to make Cyril appear normal, orders electroconvulsive therapy to be done to him. This angers Ryan, Suzanne, and others concerned with Cyril's well being but they have no legal means of stopping the ECT treatment. Meanwhile, the appeals of Cyril's death sentence are not having any success and though protests continue, his execution date moves closer and closer. Originally, Ryan stated a preference for lethal injection as the means of execution for Cyril but, after speaking with Dr. Nathan, Ryan concludes that it will be easier for Cyril to undergo the electric chair and he explains this to Cyril in terms of having one last \\"Special\\" ECT session. At this time their father Seamus arrives in Oz for killing a man in a fight. As Cyril's execution approaches, Oz's prisoners, led by prisoner Jahfree Neema, begin a protest. At the hour of Cyril's execution, Neema leads every inmate in Em City to tap on their cells. In the death room, while Cyril is being prepared to be electrocuted, his last statement to Warden Glynn is \\"Huh?\\". Right before the execution occurs, a 30-day stay is put in effect as new evidence is found in Cyril's case. Ryan then explains to Cyril that his session has been delayed. He is allowed to spend time with his brother during the days remaining before his new execution. As Cyril's final appeal fails, he is executed (he finally figures out what's going on as he is sitting in the chair once the black hood comes down, screaming for his brother- his last words being; \\"Mom! What's happening? Ryan? Ryan!\\"); as new warden Martin Querns watches, he throws up.

Biography He was born on January 31, 1881 in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, the son of Darius and Jane Cushman (nee Fuller). His primary education took place at Bridgewater Normal School, graduating in 1901. This source contains a photograph and signature for the subject. He was the captain and catcher for the baseball team along with fullback and manager for the football team. Later he was educated at Harvard University, where he received a B.S. in 1903, conferred magna cum laude. In October 1903, he married Alice Edna Wilson, with whom he had three children, Robert, Alice and Ruth, born in 1905, 1907 and 1910, respectively. He became a curator at the Boston Natural History Museum, working part-time so he could attend graduate school. He was awarded his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1909. His wife, Alice, died in January 1912; by September 1913, he had remarried to Frieda Gerlach Billings. In 1913 he became the director of the Boston Natural History Museum. The same year he remarried. Next to his home in Sharon, Massachusetts he constructed a building that would become the Cushman Laboratory for Foraminiferal Research in 1923. In his laboratory he worked as a consultant for oil companies, as well as teaching classes in micropaleontology and performing research. He specialized in the study of marine protozoans (Foraminifera) and became the foremost foraminiferologist of the first half of the twentieth century. He was aided in his laboratory by members of his family and many of foreign collaborators, including Ozawa Yoshiaki. During his career he published over 500 papers. He died from bladder cancer on April 16, 1949 at his Sharon, Massachusetts home, and was buried in Great Hills Cemetery, which is located in Boston Ma. His work was continued by his assistant and collaborator, M. Ruth Todd. Joseph Augustine Cushman is a founding father of Kappa Delta Phi National Fraternity.

Longshaw was laid down 16 June 1942 by Seattle Tacoma Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Wash.; launched 4 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Ella Mae Richards; and commissioned by Captain J.H. Stubbs on 4 December 1943. She was lost to shore fire off Naha after grounding on a reef, on 18 May 1945. History =Shakedown; 1943= Longshaw was launched, commissioned, and put to sea (15 December 1943) for tests, training, and shakedown off the west coast. She returned to port (26 January 1944) for post-shakedown availability (repairs). =Raids, Hollandia Operation; February-May 1944= Following shakedown off the west coast, Longshaw sailed from San Francisco 18 February 1944, via Pearl Harbor, for the Marshalls arriving Kwajalein 4 March. Assigned to the 5th Fleet, the destroyer got underway for Majuro 15 March, where she then conducted a patrol off Wotje and Maleolap Islands until the 21st. The ship stood out from Majuro the next day, screening the replenishment group for the Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 38/58) during strikes on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai, 30 March and 1 April, returning to Majuro on the 6th. Six days later, she sailed again, steaming via Manus for Hollandia, escorting the same task group as planes from the flattops pounded the New Guinea coast to support landings by General Douglas MacArthur's troops. Longshaw return to Pearl Harbor 9 May for minor repairs and training. =Marianas Operation, Tinian; May-August 1944= Getting underway for the Marianas on 30 May, escorting part of the northern attack force, the destroyer arrived off Saipan 15 June. For the next two months, except for a brief voyage to Eniwetok, she remained there, screening the escort carriers providing air support for the invasion and also operating as a rescue ship for downed aviators. Sailing to Eniwetok on 22 August, Longshaw departed on the 29th to guard the carriers of Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) during strikes against targets on Palau, Mindanao, and Luzon in support of the assault on the Palaus, the steppingstone to the Philippines. =Western Caroline Islands Operation; September-October 1944= On 9 September, in company with other ships of her task group, the destroyer attacked a convoy of Japanese luggers off Mindanao, herself destroying three small coastal vessels. She continued to support carrier operations against Japanese in the Philippines until proceeding to Ulithi on 2 October. =Leyte Operation; October-December 1944= Longshaw sortied with TG 38.3, 6 October for intensified airstrikes in preparation for the Philippines invasion. Planes from the carriers hit airfields on Okinawa, Luzon, and Formosa, 10 to 13 October. Longshaw, in the screen, shot down one Japanese torpedo bomber during the furious Formosa air battle on the 12th. The fast carriers continued their operations in support of the invasion of Leyte, hitting the Philippines airfields steadily until the night of 24 October, when the mighty armada turned northward to engage the Japanese northern force the next day in the Battle off Cape Enga√±o. In a series of crushing airstrikes, American naval aircraft sank the remnants of Japan's carrier force. Based at Ulithi, Longshaw operated with TG 38.3 through the end of the year, screening the carriers in airstrikes at enemy bases on Okinawa, Formosa, and Luzon, helping to clear the way for the invasion of the latter island in January. =Luzon Operation; January 1945= On the night of 9-10 January 1945, the destroyer accompanied the fast carriers through Bashi Channel between the Philippines and Formosa, entering the South China Sea. For the next 10 days, TF 38 operated unchecked, launching attacks at Japanese installations in French Indochina, Formosa, and the China coast, including Hong Kong and Hainan. After returning through Balintang Channel, the flattops pounded Okinawa once more, 22 January, before retiring to Ulithi on the 26th. =Iwo Jima, Okinawa; February-May 1945= Longshaw departed Ulithi 10 February with a night-fighter direction team on board. Sailing with the fast carrier force, she served as a fighter-direction and radar picket vessel during the airstrikes on Tokyo, 17 to 18 February; and, for the remainder of the month, escorted TG 58.5, the night carrier group in actions off Iwo Jima. Returning to Ulithi 12 March, the destroyer joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), which stood out for Okinawa on the 21st, escorting the support and bombardment unit for the invasion. Arriving 25 March, the ship shelled enemy targets ashore in support of American troops. Serving in this capacity throughout April and into May, the ship's crew performed magnificently. On call for naval gunfire support day or night, Longshaw remained continuously on station supplying her much needed firepower, despite steady attacks by Japanese suicide planes. Fate On the morning of 18 May 1945, following a grueling four-day period of fire support, Longshaw, en route to her patrol area, ran aground on a coral reef just south of Naha airfield, at 0719. Other attempts to free her failing, tug Arikara (ATF-98) arrived at 0945. At 1000, tug's skipper, Lieutenant John Aikin, and Radioman First Class James J Zikus, boarded to arrange recovery and communications. Towing commenced at 1100. At 1101, Japanese shore batteries opened up, hitting the water between Arikari and Longshaw. The stranded destroyer attempted to fight back as best she could; but, as she opened fire, her bow was completely blown off by a hit in the forward magazine. When efforts to save her appeared hopeless, the order \\"Abandon Ship\\" was relayed by word of mouth from the bridge. At 1105, all hands on the bridge were killed, injured, or stunned; the Longshaw's skipper, Lieutenant Commander Clarence William Becker, was reportedly there, mortally wounded, along with Radioman Zikus of the Ariaka. At 1115, the abandon ship order reached the aft fire room and engine room. About 1200, LCI(L)-356 came alongside to remove all wounded. The ship was burning, shells were exploding in their magazines, and the decks were hot enough to cause burns; many in the rescue party were awarded medals. The casualties included 86 dead or missing, including the skipper. (The missing were later declared dead.) In addition to the dead and missing, 95 crew members were wounded, and 113 crew members survived the sinking. Later in the afternoon, Longshaw, battered beyond salvaging, was destroyed by gunfire and torpedoes from U.S. ships. Honors Longshaw received nine battle stars for World War II service.

Life and career Kathleen was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in December, 1916. She attended John Harris High School where she was captain of her high school basketball team. \\"Kitty\\" was best described as 5 feet of dynamite. Growing up in Harrisburg, she was a swimmer, a diver, played tennis and golf better than most boys, and loved riding horses. Most of all she loved to sing. She said that was the only thing she ever wanted was a career as a jazz singer. As a young child, she sang on the local radio. After auditioning with allegedly over 100 'girl singers,' she won the praise of Glenn Miller and joined his first band in May of June 1937, as Miller's first female vocalist. She recorded five songs with Miller in November and December; \\"Sweet Stranger\\" made Metronome's Best Records list and editor George T. Simon became one of her staunchest supporters. In May of 1937 and before joining Miller's band, she had recorded a number of songs with Charlie Barnet including \\"Love is a Merry-go-Round,\\" \\"In Your Own Little Way\\" and \\"He Walked Right In.\\" Miller‚Äôs group folded due to financial issues and in January 1938, she signed with Isham Jones but did not record with his band. In late October or early November of that year, she joined Bunny Berigan (with husband Jerry Johnson as band manager) and recorded two sides, \\"I Cried for You\\" (which reached #13 on the record charts) and \\"'Deed I Do\\". A few months later, Lane was appearing with Bob Chester and during the summer of 1939 she recorded seven sides, among them a standout version of \\"Just For A Thrill\\". On September 21, 1939, she appeared on Chester's short-lived 25-minute radio show on CBS; the program was archived (along with the rest of Washington, D. C. station WJSV's complete broadcast day) and is still circulated by Old Time Radio collectors and on the internet. She stayed with Chester until October, when Dolores O'Neill became the band's featured attraction. In early November, Metronome announced that Lane had joined Red Norvo's band, but her stay was brief: in a matter of weeks she was appearing at the Strand Theater in New York with the Bob Crosby Orchestra, possibly as a last-minute substitute for Doris Day. In October 1940, Lane was Bunny Berigan's guest vocalist at the World's Fair in Flushing, New York, singing \\"Rumboogie\\" and \\"A Million Dreams Ago\\". The following month she auditioned for NBC's \\"Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street\\" but Dolores O'Neill got the job. In December, Lane was back at the Strand, this time with Woody Herman. Like the Crosby and Norvo gigs, the Strand date with Herman seems to have been a temporary arrangement: Lane did not record with Herman's Herd and apparently retired from the music business in 1941.

Biography =Cardiacs and associated music= In 1975, Tim Smith played guitar in a nameless punky, psychedelic instrumental band with school friends Mark Cawthra drums) and David Philpot (keyboards). In 1979, Smith helped record a 7\\", A Bus for a Bus on the Bus, at Elephant Studios in London. When Ralph Cade and drummer Peter Tagg left the band he invited Mark Cawthra back to take over on drums. Singer Mick Pugh subsequently left and Smith decided to take over the vocals himself. 1980 saw Smith recording the first and only Cardiac Arrest album, The Obvious Identity. Eventually, 1000 cassettes were recorded, but only sold at concerts to save on expenditure. Smith decided to change the name of the band to Cardiacs in 1981. He helped record the band's first album, Toy World, in the same manner as the Cardiac Arrest album ‚Äì on cassette tape ‚Äì at a small basement studio known as Crow Studios. After another line up change, Smith recruited Tim Quy (percussion), Sarah Cutts (saxophone) and Dominic Luckman (drums). The label Alphabet Business Concern was created in 1984. Smith was asked by vocalist Fish to support his band Marillion on their forthcoming tour near the end of the year. Smith agreed but was not prepared for the hostile audience that awaited them on all legs of the tour (forcing them off the final three days of the tour). From then until 1999, Cardiacs released six studio albums, as well as a number of singles, EPs and live albums. During the 1990s, Smith took a break from Cardiacs to work on various other projects. During 1989 and 1991, he wrote songs for a solo album, Tim Smith's Extra Special OceanLandWorld, eventually released in 1995. Smith, his ex wife Sarah Smith, and William D. Drake were reunited as The Sea Nymphs, a \\"gentler\\" version of Cardiacs; they had recorded before in 1984 and released a cassette album, Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake. Smith also performed with Jo Spratley in Spratleys Japs, who released their album Pony in 1999. In March 2006, Smith toured with Ginger & The Sonic Circus as their support act, performing acoustic versions of Cardiacs' songs, along with his own material. Cardiacs released their only single of the 2000s, \\"Ditzy Scene\\", in 2007. =Work as producer and video director= Smith owned and operated his own recording studio Apollo 8, near Salisbury, Wiltshire ‚Äì and had a long list of production credits to his name. Since the early 1990s, Smith produced recordings for a variety of musicians and musical groups, many of whom belong to the so-called \\"Cardiacs family\\". These include Levitation, Sidi Bou Said, Eat, The Monsoon Bassoon, Wildhearts frontman Ginger (including his Silver Ginger 5 and Howling Willie Cunt projects), Stars in Battledress, Oceansize, William D. Drake, The Shrubbies, The Scaramanga Six and The Trudy. Smith created and/or edited pop videos for various bands including Sepultura, Dark Star, Zu and The Frank and Walters, as well as Cardiacs. In 2008, Smith created a film called The Wildhearts Live in the Studio: A Film By Tim Smith, featuring The Wildhearts playing their self- titled album along with surreal interludes. =Illness= On 25 June 2008, Smith suffered a heart attack, which caused brain damage through hypoxia and led him to develop the rare neurological condition dystonia. In 2013, 2015 and 2017, events dubbed The Alphabet Business Convention were held in celebration of and with all proceeds funding Smith and his ongoing recovery. Among other things, they featured live music from bands within the Cardiacs' circle. In July 2016, a special one-day concert took place in Preston, called The Whole World Window with all the funds going towards helping Smith get better. A cassette and CD album of the same name were also released via Hyena Inc containing performances by the same bands. In January 2018 an appeal was launched on the crowdfunding website JustGiving with the aim of raising ¬£40,000 to fund Smith's ongoing care. The target amount was exceeded in the first day and a new target of ¬£100,000 was set to provide for a year's care. On 25 October 2018, Smith received the honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. His brother Jim accepted the honour on his behalf. =Death= Smith died on the evening of 21st July 2020 at the age of 59, following a heart attack. His death was announced by his brother and bandmate Jim Smith and bandmate Kavus Torabi. Musicians including Steven Wilson, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle's Mike Patton and Graham Coxon and Dave Rowntree of Blur paid tribute to Smith.

Initially he stood for a fee of ¬£10 (). However, few Englishmen wished to breed their mares to him, and the young stallion was moved in 1832 to Rossmore Lodge at the Curragh. Sir Hercules was then sent to England in 1833 with the rest of Rowley's racing stud to be auctioned at Tattersalls. He was sold to America for 750 guineas, but it was decided that it was too late in the season to ship him overseas, and the stallion was resold to H.O. Weatherby. Weatherby sent him to stand at stud at George Tattersall's stud, Dawley Wall Farm. In 1838, he was sent to East Acton, where he stood for a fee of ¬£30 (). However, Weatherby died and Sir Hercules was sold to Sydney Herbert (later Lord Lea). In 1844, Herbert sent the stallion to Tattersall's Willesden Paddocks, where he was available to public mares. Soon, however, Herbert broke up his stud and sold Sir Hercules to Mr. Phillips of Bushbury Stud, where the stallion eventually died at the age of thirty. Sir Hercules was influential in siring both flat and steeplechase race horses, including one winner of the Grand National. Both his sons and daughters had a profound impact on the bloodlines of horses in Australia, England, Ireland, the United States, and France. Notable progeny include: * Birdcatcher, his most famous son * Coronation: won The Derby Stakes and Ascot Derby * Faugh-a- Ballagh, won St. Leger Stakes, Grand Duke Michael Stakes, and Cesarewitch Stakes * Gaslight (1850) exported to Australia and produced four stakes- winners for 16 stakes-wins. * Gemma di Vergy (1854) won the Fernhill Stakes, the Reading Stakes, the Avon Stakes, the Nursery Handicap, the Whittlebury Stakes and the Racing Stakes, sire of Gemma-di-Vergy (1863) who was exported in utero to Australia where he was a sire. * Hyllus, won Goodwood Cup* Paraguay, exported to Australia, dam of Sir Hercules (1843 by Cap-a-Pie, a good sire) and Whalebone (1844, another good sire) *Lady Lift (1844), dam of Consul (won FR Two Thousand Guineas and FR Prix du Jockey Club) and Le Marechal (won GB Gimcrack Stakes) * The Corsair, won Two Thousand GuineasSir Hercules (GB) 1826 Retrieved 2010-3-13 * Venus (1840), dam of Aphrodite (won GB One Thousand Guineas) * Arkle (1957), three-times winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Oatway retired from the professional game in August 2007. He was assistant manager and a player at Havant & Waterlooville but departed the club in June 2009. He is currently assistant manager at Eastbourne Borough having previously been an analyst with Shanghai Shenhua, continuing his integral role within Gus Poyet's management team having previously worked with him at Brighton & Hove Albion, Sunderland, AEK Athens and Real Betis Balompi√©. Career Born in Hammersmith, London, Oatway spent eight years at Brighton & Hove Albion and eventually became club captain. He has also played for Cardiff City, Torquay United and Brentford (at all three clubs he played under manager Eddie May) as well as a brief loan spell at Lincoln City. At Brentford he scored once, his strike coming in a 3‚Äì0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup. Following yet another serious injury, Oatway retired from playing with immediate effect on 2 August 2007. Oatway's career at Brighton was successful. He won the Third Division championship in 2001, the Second Division championship in 2002 and was a Second Division play- off champion in 2004. After his retirement Oatway spent some time as a sporting liaison for \\"Albion in the Community\\" offering coaching sessions at Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College. Following his professional retirement, Oatway joined Conference South team Havant & Waterlooville as a player and assistant manager. He departed the Hawks in June 2009 following disagreements about his financial arrangements with the club: the club ceased payments for his playing contract at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season though a new contract solely as assistant manager was offered. Oatway was appointed first team coach at Brighton & Hove Albion by manager Gus Poyet on 1 December 2009. On 29 November 2016, Oatway joined Chinese Super League side Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, as a member of coaching staff to Gus Poyet. Personal life Oatway's full name is Anthony Philip David Terry Frank Donald Stanley Gerry Gordon Stephen James Oatway. The reason behind this rather unusual name is the fact that both his parents were Queens Park Rangers fans, and decided to give their son the names of QPR's entire 1973 first team squad. When his parents told his aunt the proposed name, she said \\"he'd look a right Charlie\\", and the name stuck. His son, also called Charlie, spent several years working through football developmental squads, including 2009‚Äì10 with Bognor Regis Town and 2012‚Äì13 with Brighton.

Cowles House (formerly Faculty Row House Number 7) is a structure on the campus of Michigan State University. It is the oldest extant building on MSU's campus, though only the foundation and two exterior walls remain from the original 1857 construction. Originally built to house faculty before the founding of what is now East Lansing, Number 7's earliest residents were presidents Joseph R. Williams and T. C. Abbot. When a new president's house was built at Faculty Row Number 1 (no longer standing), Number 7 became the residence of the Professor of Botany; William J. Beal and his family lived here for 39 years. As East Lansing grew and professors moved away from Faculty Row, the house served several purposes over the years, including offices for the Education Department and as a women's dormitory. It has been the official president's residence since 1941, beginning with President John A. Hannah, who had the house extensively remodeled to suit this purpose. A 1950 renovation funded by alumnus Frederick Cowles Jenison resulted in the house being named for Jenison's mother, Alice B. Cowles. (Jenison's grandfather, Albert Cowles, had been a student in the school's first class and had helped haul the bricks during the original construction.) After Hannah, three presidents have chosen not to live in the house: Walter Adams during his nine months as Acting President in 1969 and 1970, Lou Anna Simon from 2005 to 2018, and Satish Udpa during his eight months as acting president in 2019. All three preferred to remain in their East Lansing homes, and instead used Cowles House primarily for formal entertaining and other official university functions. The house was being renovated during most of Udpa's tenure.

The plane was quickly buried in the resulting avalanche and heavy snowfall that was taking place at the time. The plane lay undetected deep beneath the snow and glacial ice for over 50 years. Its remnants finally re-emerged at the glacier terminus in 2000.

He is best known for the innovative and shocking television series The Secret Cabaret made for Britain's Channel 4. Early life Born in London, Drake is the son of a GP and both sides of his family were connected to the medical profession for some generations. In an interview included in a recent book about Arthur Brown, Drake was working as a record plugger at Decca Records when he met Arthur Brown: > Arthur's single 'Fire' was the first record I bought at the age of 12. As > the years went on I saw Arthur at the Rainbow with Kingdom Come. I was a > huge fan...I was promoted to plugger.

He has a wide and diverse performing history, from Terayama's Tenjo Sajiki theatre in Japan to the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium before Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. Drake also performed for Diana, The Princess of Wales at the Hippodrome, London, Prince Andrew at Tokyo Joes Nightclub and the Princess Margaret at The Park Lane Hotel where Sir Frederick Ashton told the young performer, ‚ÄòYou have more feeling in your dance than a dozen principals of the Royal Ballet put together, but absolutely NO technique! It‚Äôs sublime and so refreshing‚Äô. Drake had received a scholarship to attend Marcel Marceau‚Äôs Academy in Paris but Ashton warned him against the idea urging Drake that he didn‚Äôt need to become a clone of Marceau. He advised Nicolas Roeg for the film Castaway, with the tricky task of coaching Oliver Reed in sleight of hand, and was magic advisor to Harvey Keitel on Fairy Tale, A True Story. In two series of the award-nominated The Secret Cabaret for Channel Four, he won an international cult following for his original and shocking presentation of illusions and manipulation routines. He worked alongside magician Pat Page. He has performed and consulted with many stars including: Elton John, Phil Collins, Madness, David Gilmour, Meat Loaf, Steve Miller's Abracadabra, Darryl Hall, Bill Wyman, George Harrison, Julian Lennon, Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Katy Perry and Pamela Stephenson. In August 1993 he was seen on American TV in the special Raising Hell, in which he co-starred with Iron Maiden in their final show with Bruce Dickinson on vocals in those years (the singer rejoined the band some years later).The show was shot at Pinewood Studios, near London, and broadcast live on American TV. It was later bought by the BBC for transmission in the UK and broadcast but heavily censored. See The same month Drake performed with Carl Davis and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Drake has met David Copperfield on several occasions, with Copperfield once saying Simon is \\"the English version of me, but from hell!\\". Drake has performed twice as a guest with The Royal Ballet at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and the London Coliseum. He has appeared at festivals and tours in Canada, New Zealand, Europe and in the UK and has had residencies at many London nightclubs as well as a month in cabaret at The Casino in Monte Carlo, Paris and Dubai. He was the magic and effects supervisor to Cameron Mackintosh for the West End production of The Witches of Eastwick and Ducktastic, directed by Kenneth Branagh.Quinlan, \\"Celebrity Interview\\" He was a consultant on the South London Theatre's Spring 2007 production of Dr Faustus. He was also a consultant on the production of episode 6 of the fourth series of the BBC television drama Hustle, broadcast in 2007, where he worked with producers and writers to resolve the problem of how to make $5 million in cash be stolen when it appeared to be actually still there. Inventing a complex and elaborate scam, the episodes final positioning in the series was testament to its effectiveness. He was also a magic advisor on the Terry Gilliam film The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. Feb 2009 Drake travelled across 5 American states on a quest for the strange and very peculiar. He met, interviewed and photographed jesters, jokers, crazed hoarders, automata collectors, strippers, mechanical geniuses, several stars of magic, the inventor of the first computer game and a private astronaut. He said, \\"It was supposed to be my holiday but turned into damn hard work and about the most fascinating and fun time I have had in years!\\" Drake's photos and interviews appear in Dennis Publishing's Bizarre Magazine over the next 12 months as 3‚Äì5-page features.  House of Magic  In 1996 he opened his own venue, Simon Drake's House of Magic, in a converted Victorian building at an unpublicised location in London. This performing space specialises in corporate entertainment functions with monthly public performance nights. Shows feature Drake's trademark effects as well as light-hearted amputations and decapitations of senior executives and celebrity guests. A born performer and incredibly down to earth host, Simon Drake arrives in a cloud of forlorn smoke, set to regale the crowd with floating candles, bloodied knives and the snatching of audience heads.

It focuses around the fictional fast food chain Lucky Cow and its workers. In the strip, the restaurant's advertisements advocate obesity and unhealthy eating habits.  Publication history  The strip began on April 21, 2003, and the last strip ran on February 2, 2008. The strip appeared in about 50 papers. Pett previously created the comic strip Mr. Lowe, which was distributed through Creators Syndicate from 2000 to 2001. Characters from Mr. Lowe make occasional cameos in Lucky Cow. A Lucky Cow strip earned a place in Guinness World Records as the World's Largest Comic Strip, after students at Gentry High School in Indianola, Mississippi assembled a strip that was wide and almost high. In January 2008, Universal Press Syndicate confirmed reports that Pett had decided to end Lucky Cow. According to the Daily Cartoonist, Pett had been thinking about the decision for a while, and he ultimately ended it when the timing felt just right and the strip seemed to have run its course. He was also planning to explore other creative opportunities, some of which will be related to cartooning. Lucky Cow ended in a dramatic fashion with its final series, in which the employees of the franchise are getting ready to welcome Javier, a Mexican exchange student who will be working there, to the United States. To make him feel at home, Gary hangs a Mexican flag in front of the restaurant, launching a controversy when photographs turn up on the internet with the caption, \\"United States of Mexico? When did Lucky Cow start hating America?!\\" Picketers, including Clare, line up outside the restaurant demanding a nationwide boycott of Lucky Cow franchises. Lucky Cow corporate responds to the damage the flag incident has caused by closing the franchise and selling the premises to another business‚ÄîCash Cow, which lends title loans. The final strip ran on February 2, 2008. Story and characters All of the main characters are employees of the same Lucky Cow fast food restaurant. * Gary is the manager of this Lucky Cow franchise. He is a single father raising two children. He likes to imagine that he is bringing the world a little bit closer together through fast food; he loves customer service, unlike his daughter. * Clare, arguably the main character, is Gary's teenaged daughter. She resents being forced to work at her father's restaurant for spending money. She is lazy, greedy, and provides very poor customer service. * Neil, initially a minor character, quickly became very popular and almost the main character of the strip. Another teenaged employee, he is timid and acne-ridden. He isn't exactly the brightest person around, either; however, he is gentle and good-hearted. In strips set outside the restaurant, Neil is sometimes seen being bullied in high school by the shorter but \\"tougher\\" Kenny. The popularity of the character may have arisen from the fact that Clare was simply a typical, sarcastic teenager while Neil was more of a sympathetic character. * Leticia is Clare's friend and coworker. Her role in the comic is the moral compass and the voice of reason, as she is much kinder and wiser than Clare. She works at Lucky Cow to make money for college.

It overlooks the Telok Blangah area, and the western parts of the Central Area. The summit is accessible by Mount Faber Road or Mount Faber Loop via Morse Road, but there are many footpaths or trails leading up the hill. The main paths are: Marang Trail which leads from Marang Road at the Harbourfront MRT station (Exit D) and the Southern Ridges Park Connector which connects from Telok Blangah Hill Park, Kent Ridge Park and Henderson Waves. It is a frequent tourist destination, as it provides a panoramic view of the increasingly dense central business district within the Central Area. Its slope includes a tower that is part of the Singapore cable car system that connects to HarbourFront and Sentosa. It is accessible from the HarbourFront MRT station. History View of Mount Faber from Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant Mount Faber was known as Telok Blangah Hill but was later renamed after Captain Charles Edward Faber of the Madras Engineers, the superintending engineer in the Straits and Governor Butterworth's brother-in-law, who arrived in Singapore in September 1844. Faber cut through the thick undergrowth, allowing the road to the top of the hill to be built. The original winding road was referred to in the press at that time as a \\"stupidly narrow road\\". The article also questioned the change of the name from what it deemed its originally more appropriate Malay name. A signal station was erected on the hill in 1845. This signal station was transferred from Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa) because of the \\"injurious miasma\\" on the island. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Straits government decided to convert Mount Faber into a fort for fear of revolt among the local Indian sepoys. Defence work was carried out and granite emplacements for guns were completed halfway up the hill, but Mount Faber never became a fort. Geography The vegetation around Mount Faber is secondary rainforest that is smaller and less dense than on Bukit Timah Hill. Mount Faber is one of the higher hills in Singapore at 106 metres (348 ft.), lower than Bukit Timah Hill (164 m (538 ft.)) and Bukit Gombak (133 m (436 ft.) and 113 m (371 ft.)). It is separated from the adjacent slightly lower Telok Blangah Hill Park by Henderson Road. Gallery File:The Jewel Box, Nov 06.JPGThe Jewel Box on Mount Faber houses the cable car station to Sentosa.

It is one of the largest mosques in India with a capacity of 20,000. The mosque was built between the 16th and 17th centuries, and is a state-protected monument situated in the heart of the old city of Hyderabad, close to the historic landmarks of Charminar, Chowmahalla Palace and Laad Bazaar. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and used them in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, thus giving the mosque its name. It formed the centerpiece around which the city was planned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. History and construction Makkah Masjid was built during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth Qutb Shahi Sultan of Golconda (now Hyderabad). The three arched facades have been carved from a single piece of granite, which took five years to quarry. More than 8,000 workers were employed to build the mosque. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah personally laid the foundation stone and constructed it. The construction was abandoned after the death of the Emperor. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a French explorer, in his travelogue observed: > \\"It is about 50 years since they began to build a splendid pagoda in the > town which will be the grandest in all India when it is completed. The size > of the stone is the subject of special accomplishment, and that of a niche, > which is its place for prayer, is an entire rock of such enormous size that > they spent five years in quarrying it, and 500 to 600 men were employed > continually on its work.

Buildings  = Morrill Hall of Agriculture = Built in 1909, in a Neo-Classical design, Agriculture Hall was the largest building at what was then, State Agricultural College, when it opened and still houses the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources today. In 1999, on New Year Eve, the building was subject to an act of eco terrorism when the building was set on fire by the members of the Earth Liberation Front, causing more than $1 million of damage protesting research involving genetically modified crops being conducted at the university. In 2008 four people were arrested and charged with setting the fire and later convicted After the original Morrill Hall was demolished in 2013, the building was renamed the Justin S. Morrill Hall of Agriculture, after the Vermont senator who wrote the act establishing the land-grant college system. = Cook Hall = Opened 1889 as the Agriculture Laboratory it was the first agricultural laboratory at the State Agricultural College. It then became known as Entomology, the Department of Entomology occupied the space after Agriculture Hall opened in 1909 until 1948 when the Natural Sciences Building was constructed. The building is named after Dr. Albert John Cook, a Professor of Zoology and Entomology at the school from 1868 to 1893. Today it serves as office space for various departments within the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. = Chittenden Hall = Originally the Dairy Building and later the Forestry Building, the building now called Chittenden Hall was completed in 1901. It became home to the Forestry Department when a new Dairy building was built in 1912. Forestry moved from the building in 1966, when the Natural Resources Building opened. The building is named after Alfred K. Chittenden, a Professor of Forestry from 1914 until his death in 1930. = Eustace‚ÄìCole Hall = Eustace-Cole hall is home to the MSU Honors College. Formerly University College Building,Harry J. Eustace Hall, formerly Horticultural Laboratory is the only building on MSU's main campus that is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the third oldest extant building on the Michigan State campus. Originally designed as a laboratory for horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1888, who designed it as the first distinctively horticultural laboratory in the United States. This building housed the horticulture department until 1924, when the new horticulture building, now known as Old Horticulture, opened.President McPherson Renovation Announcement, Archive The building was renamed in 1961 after Harry J. Eustace, who chaired Horticulture Department from 1908 to 1918. In 1999 the building underwent a $3 million renovation thanks to a donation by MSU alumni Jeffery and Kathryn Cole, being renamed in their honor. Eustace- Cole now serves as the headquarters of MSU's Honors College. = Marshall- Adams Hall = The Bacteriology Laboratory opened in 1902 and was the first free standing bacteriology laboratory in the United States. The building housed the Department of Bacteriology and Hygiene now known as Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. The department would stay there until 1952 when it moved to Giltner Hall. The building was originally named Marshall Hall in honor of Charles Edward Marshall the first department head, in 2002 following a renovation funded by MSU Trustee Randall Pittman, Pittman requested that it be renamed for MSU President and Professor of Economics Walter Adams. The Department of Economics houses it offices in the building today. = Old Botany = Built in 1892, it replaced a Botany building located in the Beal Gardens that was destroyed by fire in 1890. = Veterinary Laboratory = The Veterinary Laboratory was built in 1885 on a site just west of Agriculture Hall, it is the only building that was part of Lab Row to have been demolished. The lab was supplanted by a new veterinary clinic in 1913 and was torn down in 1930 when the new Anatomy Building, the first phase of what is now Giltner Hall, was built.

Plot The story is entitled The Wandering Jew, but the figure of the Wandering Jew himself plays a minimal role. The prologue of the text describes two figures who cry out to each other across the Bering Straits. One is the Wandering Jew, the other his sister, H√©rodiade. The Wandering Jew also represents the cholera epidemic‚Äî wherever he goes, cholera follows in his wake.Sue was unaware of the way cholera is really spread, by fecal contamination of water. He was writing before the London physician John Snow investigated the cause of an 1854 cholera outbreak in Soho, thus originating modern epidemiology The Wandering Jew and H√©rodiade are condemned to wander the earth until the entire Rennepont family has disappeared from the earth. The connection is that the descendants of the sister are also the descendants of Marius de Rennepont, Huguenots persecuted under Louis XIV by the Jesuits. The brother and sister are compelled to protect this very family from all harm. After this first introduction, the two appear only very rarely. The Rennepont family is unaware that these protective √©minences grises exist, but they benefit from their protection in various ways, be it by being saved from scalping by the Native Americans, or from languishing in prison. The Rennepont family lost its position and most of its wealth during the French persecution of the Protestants (after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685). A small fortune was given to a Jewish banker immediately before the Renneponts dispersed all over Europe and Asia, and this fortune has grown into a huge sum, through the miracle of compound interest. In 1682, the Rennepont family members each got a bronze medal telling them to meet back in Paris 150 years later, at which time the fortune will be divided among the surviving members. So much time has passed, however, that almost none of the still-living Renneponts have any idea why they need to come to Paris. They nevertheless set out from India, Siberia, America, France, and elsewhere to make their way to rue Saint-Fran√ßois No. 3 in Paris by 13 February 1832. The members of the family are not only dispersed all over the world, but also all over the social ladder, as laborers, factory owners, princes (in India!) and the independently wealthy. The Jesuits have heard of this huge fortune and want to get it for themselves. Two Jesuits (Rodin and P√®re d'Aigrigny) and their many recruited accomplices are in charge of obtaining the money for the Society of Jesus and dispossessing the Rennepont family. Their plan is to have only the unwitting Gabriel, the Jesuit missionary, show up to claim the fortune. Since he is a monk and can have no possessions of his own, the fortune will go to the wily Jesuits. Gabriel's entry into the order is not accidental ‚Äì it is his pious mother, manipulated by the Jesuits, who persuaded him to become a Jesuit. The Jesuits have spies and henchmen all over the world, from the remote Americas to Siberia, and they use them to put obstacles in the paths of the Renneponts as they make their way back to Paris. Moreover, they also spy on each other, demonstrating that they don't even trust each other. The principal obstacles are as follows: *Gabriel, Jesuit missionary in America, Rennepont. No obstacles, because he is supposed to collect the fortune. *Dagobert, friend of the Rennepont family and guardian of the orphans Rose and Blanche (see below). Has his papers and the medal stolen by Morok, an animal tamer and accomplice of the Jesuits. Also has his horse, Jovial, killed by Morok's panther. Forced to travel on foot without papers and arrested for vagrancy. Freed by H√©rodiade. Lured to a false meeting with a notary pretending to have messages from G√©n√©ral Simon (see below). *Rose and Blanche, twin Rennepont orphans coming from Siberia. Since they are under Dagobert's protection, they are also arrested and put in jail for vagrancy. Also, they are put in a convent by Dagobert's wife while Dagobert is at the notary meeting. She is made to swear by the Jesuits that she will not tell Dagobert where they are. G√©n√©ral Simon, father of Rose and Blanche, is a Rennepont, unknown to his daughters. G√©n√©ral Simon has been so long exiled from France and his family that he doesn't even know he has daughters. He thinks he has one son. He does not arrive for the meeting, either, although his situation is less clear than that of the others. *Djalma, Indian prince Rennepont, coming from the Far East. In Java, Djalma is accused of belonging to a murderous sect called the ‚ÄúEtrangleurs,‚Äù who closely resemble the Thuggee. One of the Jesuit henchmen tattoos Djalma with the Etrangleur tattoo on the inside of his arm while he is asleep. Djalma tries to prove that he is not an Etrangleur, but because of the tattoo is thrown in jail. This causes him to miss the boat to Paris. After finally arriving in Paris, he is poisoned by Farighea (whom he had thought was his friend), so that he goes into a prolonged sleep. The Jesuits then kidnap him. *Jacques Rennepont, Parisian workman. He was given papers by his father that explain his fortune, but since he doesn't know how to read or write, he is unable to use them. The Jesuits send a money lender to him; when he cannot repay the loan, he is thrown into debtors' prison. *Fran√ßois Hardy, progressive factory owner, Paris. He is betrayed by his best friend who, under the influence of P√®re d'Aigrigny, lures Hardy to central France, ensuring that he will not arrive on 13 February. *Adrienne de Cardoville, independently wealthy, Paris. Lives with her aunt, who is a former mistress of father d'Aigrigny. The aunt, the abbot Aigrigny, and a Jesuit doctor Baleinier connive to put Adrienne in an insane asylum that happens to be next to the convent where Rose and Blanche are trapped. Only Gabriel shows up to the meeting, but at the last minute H√©rodiade makes an appearance. Gabriel recognizes her from when she rescued him in the Americas. H√©rodiade goes to a drawer and pulls out a codicil that explains that the parties have three and a half months from 13 February to present themselves. Upon this unexpected turn of events the P√®re d'Aigrigny is fired, and Rodin replaces him. He decides to take more drastic action by using cholera to annihilate some of the Rennepont family. He maneuvers Rose, Blanche, and Jacques in front of the cholera epidemic and thereby rids himself of them. With Fran√ßois Hardy, Rodin shows him how Hardy's best friend had betrayed him. He also arranges for Hardy's mistress to leave for the Americas, and has Hardy's treasured factory burn to the ground (all this on the same day). Hardy takes refuge among the Jesuits, who persuade him to enter their order. Djalma falls in love with Adrienne, so the Jesuits use his passion to destroy him: they make Djalma think that Adrienne has been unfaithful, and he poisons himself. But he dies slowly and drinks only half the bottle, so there's plenty of time for Adrienne to find out what he's done and poison herself, too. ( c.f. Romeo and Juliet). On the day of the second meeting, none of the Renneponts show up (Gabriel having quit the Jesuits), and Rodin alone presents himself. But Samuel, the guardian of the house, has realized the injustices that have taken place. He brings the coffins of all the Renneponts back to show Rodin his wickedness, and he burns the testament that would have given Rodin access to the money. Gabriel and Hardy die as a matter of course, which means that the Wandering Jew and H√©rodiade can finally rest in peace. The last pages of the novel recount their final \\"death,\\" which they joyfully encounter. It is not clear what finally happens to the vast fortune that was never claimed. Publication The Wandering Jew was a serially published novel, which attained great popularity in Paris, and beyond. According to historian John McGreevy, the novel was intensely and deliberately \\"anti- Catholic\\".Catholicism and American Freedom,, John McGreevy Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23. Its publication, and that of its predecessor The Mysteries of Paris, greatly increased the circulation of the magazines in which they were published; in addition they are held to have influenced legislation on the Jesuits, and caused a general \\"jesuitophobie\\". The novel is over 1,400 pages long. An opera, Le Juif errant, by Fromental Hal√©vy, was based on elements of the novel. Notes References *Sue, Eug√®ne. Le Juif Errant. 1844.

It encompasses the musical genres psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop, and has been described as a prototype of heavy metal music. With special effects and dual lead guitars by Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, it was considered groundbreaking for the time. However, it only made a modest showing in the record charts and ended the group's six Top 20 singles run in the UK and US. Recording The Yardbirds recorded \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" after the sessions for Yardbirds (also known as Roger the Engineer (UK) and Over Under Sideways Down (US)). Paul Samwell-Smith, founding member and bassist, left the group in June 1966 to pursue record production full-time and was initially replaced by studio guitarist Jimmy Page. However, by \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\", Page switched to second lead guitar alongside Jeff Beck. Rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja took over on bass, although for the recording session musician John Paul Jones provided the bass. Beck, Page, and Jones had recorded earlier together for \\"Beck's Bolero\\" in May 1966. Drummer Jim McCarty added harmony vocal to singer Keith Relf's lead vocal. During the guitar solo, Beck parodies some comments heard during the group's visit to a health clinic: Charts and reception \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" reached number 30 on Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and number 43 in the UK Single Chart. In a song review for AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald describes \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" as He adds it is \\"One of the greatest, lost singles from the 1966/1967 era... this very progressive record was somewhat lost in the shuffle.\\" The song appears at number three in Record Collector‚Äôs chronological list of the \\"100 Greatest Psychedelic Records\\".

The American picture sleeve, featuring Beck and Page in the photo, only coincides with the A-side of the Epic single. The B-side, \\"The Nazz Are Blue\\", features the pre-Page lineup with Paul Samwell-Smith, as well as a rare lead vocal by Beck. The UK single's B-side \\"Psycho Daisies\\" similarly features the earlier line-up and vocals by Beck. Additionally, the sheet music erroneously used the same pre-Beck group photo with Eric Clapton that was also mistakenly used for the US single picture sleeve for \\"Heart Full of Soul\\".

The genus is currently monotypic, only including the type species A. giganticus. The first remains were found in 1989 during a mongolian-russian field expedition in Mongolia and later described in 1999. Since the first discovery and description, no more specimens have been found. It represents the first and largest dromaeosaurid known from the Bayan Shireh Formation. It was a large, heavy-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore that would have been an active feathered predator hunting with the enlarged sickle claw on each second toe. Estimated at in length with a weight about , Achillobator is considered to be one of the largest dromaeosaurs, along with Austroraptor, Dakotaraptor and Utahraptor. The most characteristic feature of Achillobator is its primitive pelvis, having a vertically oriented pubis that differs from the rest of dromaeosaurids. Most of its preserved elements are very robust, an unusual trait in dromaeosaurs, which were generally lightly built animals. Achillobator is classified as a dromaeosaurid taxon, more specifically within the Eudromaeosauria, a group of hypercarnivore dromaeosaurids that were mainly terrestrial instead of arboreal or amphibious. In most cladistic analyses Achillobator is recovered as a close relative of Dromaeosaurus and Utahraptor, although it is often considered to be the sister taxon of the latter. The stocky and short hindlimb ratio of Achillobator indicates that it was not cursorial‚Äîan animal adapted for speed or to mantain high speeds‚Äîmoreover, the robust morphology of the maxilla suggests a predatory behavior based on large- sized prey. History of discovery Fossil localities in Mongolia. Locality of Achillobator in Burkhant, at Area D In 1989, during a field exploration conducted by the Mongolian and Russian Paleontological Expedition in the Gobi Desert, examining the outcrops at Khongil, South Central Mongolia, many dinosaur fossil discoveries were made. About 5.6 km away from the Khongil locality, a large and mostly disarticulated partial theropod skeleton was discovered in fine-grained, medium sandstone/gray mudstone that was deposited dating back to the Late Cretaceous epoch at the Burkhant locality, Bayan Shireh Formation. The preserved specimen was found in association with a left maxilla preserving nine teeth and two alveoli, four cervical vertebrae, three dorsal vertebrae and eight caudal vertebrae, a nearly complete pelvic girdle compromising both pubes, right illium and right ischium, both femora and left tibia, left metatarsals III and IV, manual and pedal phalanges with some unguals, right scapulocoracoid, an isolated radius, two ribs and caudal chevrons. Traces of tail tendons were found too, but mostly isolated. It was collected and exceptionally prepared by the assistant paleontologist Namsarai Batulseen and stored as MNUFR-15. Ten years later, the unusual specimen was formally described in 1999 and became the holotype for the new genus and species: Achillobator giganticus. It was identified as a dromaeosaurid taxon, a large one. The description was performed by the Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle, and North American paleontologists Mark A. Norell and James M. Clark. In terms of etymology, the generic name, Achillobator, is derived from the Latin word Achillis (genitive singular of Achilles) in reference to the large Achilles tendon that supported the second pedal ungual (known as \\"sickle\\" claw) of most dromaeosaurids, and the old Mongolian word –±–∞–∞—Ç–∞—Ä (baatar, meaning hero). The specific name, giganticus, is derived from the Ancient Greek word Œ≥ŒπŒ≥Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (gigantik√≥s, meaning gigantic) in reference to the large size of the holotype, which exceeds most dromaeosaurids. Illustration of the pelvis However, the description was published in a very preliminary format, being not complete at all, having a few issues with the preserved elements, and numerous typographical errors. Due to a misinterpretation, the pedal ungual II (or sickle claw) was claimed to be preserved and to articulate with the pedal phalanx II, however, this was corrected by Senter in 2007 and this ungual actually represents a manual one. According to Turner and colleagues in 2012 during their large revision of the Dromaeosauridae, the paper was likely published without the knowledge of the two latter paleontologists as indicated by a draft left in Mongolia in 1997. =Chimera hypothesis= The pelvic girdle of Achillobator features plesiomorphic (primitive) saurischian characteristics compared to other dromaeosaurids. For instance, the pubis is aligned vertically and has a relatively large pubic boot (a wide expansion at the end), unlike most other dromaeosaurids, where there is generally a much smaller boot. The preserved vertebrae are very robust and features a series of pleurocoels. The above differences led Burnham and team in 2000 to suggest that the holotype of Achillobator in fact, represents a paleontological chimera, and only the pedal unguals may have come from a dromaeosaurid-grade dinosaur. However, the specimen was actually found in semiarticulation and therefore the assignment of remains to a single individual is validated. Although Achillobator features unusual and primitive characteristics compared to other relatives, the genus keeps being recovered as a dromaeosaur taxon. Description Size comparison between the holotype of Achillobator and an 1.8 m tall human The holotype is estimated to have reach a length of and weighed . Supporting Online Material In the large taxonomic revision of the Dromaeosauridae performed by Turner and colleagues in 2012, they noted that this genus represents the second largest dromaeosaurid taxon (after Utahraptor) with a tibial length of . The gigantic size of Achillobator is only approached or surpassed by the also paravians Austroraptor, Dakotaraptor and Utahraptor. Achillobator was a deep-bodied and relatively short-armed dromaeosaurid with stocky and robust hindlimbs. Some of the most notable features consisted in the strongly vertical pubis and the robustly built skeleton, such as the deep maxilla and femur. The holotype was found lacking traces of feather integument, however, there are strong evidence coming from other relatives that suggest the likely presence of plumage on Achillobator. According to the revised diagnosis by Turner and colleagues in 2012, Achillobator can be distinguished based on the following combination of characteristics and autapomorphies: the promaxillary fenestra is completely exposed, the promaxillary and maxillary fenestrae are elongate and vertically oriented at same level in the maxilla, metatarsal III is wide on the upper end, the femur is longer than the tibia, the pelvis is propubic, the obturator process on the ischium is large and triangular situated on the upper half of ischial shaft, the boot at distal symphysis of pubis is developed in a cranial and caudal aspect. =Skull= The preserved maxilla is partially complete, missing pretty much of its nasal processes (bony projections). It measures in length and the lateral side is smooth compared to the dorsal areas, although its structure is very robust. It preserves 11 alveoli, of which 9 are filled with well-preserved teeth. The teeth display marked homodonty (teeth of similar size) and they are serrated and recurved with the posterior serrations being slightly larger than the anterior serrations. Along with the posterior serrations, there are 15 or 18 denticles per near the center of the teeth., although the anterior serrations have 17 to 20 denticles per . Given the dimensions of the preserved maxilla, Perle and colleagues suggested that Achillobator had a relatively large skull competing to those of carnosaurs. =Postcranial skeleton= Life restoration Well preserved material is known from the axial area, compromising very robust and somewhat large cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae. There are about four cervicals preserved. As stated by the authors, the anterior series of cervical vertebrae are sharply- angled developed, with the anterior articulation facet of the centrum developed over the posterior facet. These characteristics are indicators of a S-shaped neck, as seen in most maniraptorans. Three dorsals were preserved with apparently two dorsal ribs. The dorsals are stocky and have pleurocoels at the lateral surfaces, some dorsals have two. Their centrum articulation facets are rounded and concave in shape. In general, the neural processes of the dorsal vertebrae show resemblance to those of large ratites such as the extinct moa and extant emu, ostrich and cassowary. They feature protruding interspinous ligaments scars that indicates a robust and similar back to those birds. Eight caudals were found with one of the caudals belonging to the transitional series (anteriormost), three to the middle area and four to the posterior end. These four were found in articulation. Some traces of tail tendons were found isolated, probably indicators of a riged tail. In all the caudal vertebrae the centrum is amphiplatian (flat on both ends) with the posterior articulation facet being more concave than the anterior one. As indicated by the transitional caudal, the anterior neural spines are elongated and progressively disappear on posterior caudals. Regarding the shoulder girdle, only the right scapulocoracoid and a radius were preserved, the latter was not described. However, the radius was measured at long. In the posterior area of the acromion process, the scapula preserves a small tubercle that attached area for the muscle scapulohumeralis in life. The glenoid is located at the bottom area facing to the lateral side. The scapula is relatively elongated and flattened at the scapular blade. The blade is thickened and slightly curved to the inner side following the rounded shape of the rib cage. The coracoid is robust and broad, measuring long and in height. The anterior edge is coarsely textured, likely for the articulation with cartilaginous tissue. A large foramen is located from the front to the back, probably acting as a channel for blood vessels and nerves. Diagram featuring the preserved tissue traces on femur and tibia Both femora were nicely preserved. In general terms, the femur is highly robust and longer than the tibia, a rare trait in dromaeosaurids, measuring in length. It preserves detailed information of muscle attachments. On the anterior inner surface, there's a large, sculptured, concave surface that likely worked as the insertion for the m. iliofemoralis internus in life, and the lesser trochanter preserves the insertion for the m. pubo ischio femoralis on the lower edge. On the upper lateral surface of the femur, bottom-oriented to the greater trochanter, there is a tubercle that formed the attachment for the m. iliofemoralis. Insertions for m. ilio trochantericus and ischio trochantericus are located on the posterolateral surface at the proximal end of the femur. In the inner side, on the proximal third part of the shaft, a coarse, concave area is preserved, likely an attachment for m. pubo ischio femoralis externus-3. Below this area, a small, convex tubercle attended the insertion for m. pubo ischio femoralis-2. The left tibia is a little bit less robust than the femur, but more straight, it measures in length. The surface of the shaft center is smooth, without traces of muscles. In front and towards the back surface of the cnemial crest however, there is a coarse and microsculptured area that worked as the attachment for m. ilio tibialis and ambiens. Additional tissue traces in the preserved tibia are situated on the lower surface and toward the posterior aspect. Here, a depression with a somewhat coarse surface likely attached prominent aponeurosis of the connected ligaments to the tibia and fibular head when the animal was alive. Apparently no other tissue surfaces are preserved. Left metatarsals III and IV are stocky, measuring and respectively, indicating that the length of the metatarsus was under the 50% of the tibial length. As in other maniraptorans, the metatarsals were closely united. The top end of metatarsal III is side to side flattened and is not pinched at the upper end, therefore lacking an arctometatarsalian condition. The lower end of metatarsal IV has a joint where motion is restricted to one plane and the lateral condyle is short. Cross section through the tail of Carnotaurus, showing the enlarged caudofemoralis muscle The most emblematic element from the holotype is the striking pelvis, being virtually complete; it preserves the right illium, ischium and both pubis. Although complete, the remains are slightly crushed and deformed. The illium is prominently tall measuring in length and in height with a preacetabular situated from top to bottom. It is full of tissue traces: in an inner side view, both m. caudofemoralis are preserved. On the anterior edge there are microstriations that likely gave form to the m. iliofemoralis in life, behind to this area, traces of the m. ilio tibialis-2 are also preserved. The pubis measures long and is very straight having a large distal pubic boot; striking resemblance to Carnosaurs. For instance, other dromaeosaurids have a very opisthopubic pelvic configuration, Achillobator however, has a primitive, propubic configuration. The large pubic boot preserves very coarse areas on the dorsal surface, indicators for the m. pubo ischio femoralis internus ventralis attachment. Its lateral view is very flat and sculptured, having numerous microstriations that probably originated the m. pubo ischio femoralis externus. The preserved ischium is shorter than the latter elements, measuring in length. A large ridge is formed on its shaft and expands to the anterior edge, likely forming the m. adductor femoris in life. This ridge-like structure is heavy-built compared to other dromaeosaurids. At the side and away from the main body, the surface is very rough, possibly attaching m. flexor tibialis internus-1 in life as seen in other theropods and crocodiles. Classification Many genera of the Dromaeosauridae Achillobator is classified within the Dromaeosauridae, a group of very bird-like, maniraptoran dinosaurs. In its original description, Achillobator was placed as a close relative of Dromaeosaurus with an ambiguous position in the family. In more recent and solid research the genus is considered to be part of the Eudromaeosauria, a group of dromaeosaurids that were obligate terrestrial and hypercarnivore animals, better known as the \\"true dromaeosaurids\\". They strongly differ from other dromaeosaurs, such as the arboreal microraptorians or amphibious halszkaraptorines. Eudromaeosauria was first defined as a node-based clade by Nicholas R. Longrich and Philip J. Currie in 2009 as the most inclusive natural group containing Dromaeosaurus, Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, their most recent common ancestor and all of its other descendants. The various \\"subfamilies\\" have also been re-defined as clades, usually defined as all species closer to the groups namesake than to Dromaeosaurus or any namesakes of other sub-clades. Comparison between giant dromaeosaurs including the smaller Velociraptor The recent phylogenetic analysis conducted by Hartman and colleagues in 2019, surprisingly recovers Achillobator as the sister taxon of Yixianosaurus, not only that but Currie and Evans 2020 have recover the position of the genus within the Velociraptorinae. Although some analyses have place the genus in unusual positions, Achillobator has been recovered as a dromaeosaurine very related to Utahraptor and Dromaeosaurus in most phylogenetic analyses. Even more similarities within Achillobator and Utahraptor were found with the osteological reexamiation of Utahraptor specimens, supporting their close relationships. During the description of Halszkaraptor in 2017 and the coined Halszkaraptorinae, new affinities for dromaeosaurids were proposed in order to include this new subfamily. Achillobator was recovered in a basal position outside a clade formed by Dromaeosaurus and Utahraptor. But in the results for the Eudromaeosauria phylogeny based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Jasinski and colleagues in 2020 during the description of Dineobellator, Achillobator was again recovered in the traditional Utahraptor+Achillobator clade but this time outside the Dromaeosaurinae.

In addition, the prominent pelvis of Achillobator has its own specialized femoral muscle retractors that seem to indicate a strong ability for leaping. In 2016, Scott Persons IV and Currie examined the limb proportion of numerous theropods and found that compsognathids, troodontids and tyrannosauroids were cursorial animals with many taxa recovered with relatively high CLP (Cursorial-limb-proportion) scores, but dromaeosaurids being recovered with low CLP scores. Achillobator was recovered scoring ‚àí5.3 indicating that, despite having powerful legs, it was not adapted to maintain high speeds for extended amounts of time. Manning et al. 2009 tested the function of the sickle claw of dromaeosaurids by analyzing the biomechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, and using comparisons within the curvature of the dromaeosaurid sickle claw on the foot with curvature in modern birds and mammals. They found that they were ideal for climbing and for a ground-dwelling life style. Peter Mackovicky stated that the analysis might be correct on primitive dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) being tree-climbers, however, this doesn't explain why giant animals like Achillobator or Utahraptor retained sickle claws when they were way too large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky suggested that larger dromaeosaurids adapted the claw to be used exclusively for a more aggressive predatory behaviour. The striking resemblance between the feet and legs of dromaeosaurids and those of accipitrid birds of prey, led Fowler et al. 2011 to propose that dromaeosaurids hunted in a similar way to those raptorial birds. They found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs resemble those of eagles and hawks by having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of flexion, but the metatarsals share more resemblance to those of owls. The model RPR (Raptor Prey Restraint), proposes that dromaeosaurs leaped into their prey, immobilizing it with their body weight, and then hold it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws; afterwards, the dromaeosaur would start to feed on the animal while it's still alive and the death will eventually came from blood loss and organ failure. The arms or \\"wings\\", that were likely covered in long feathers (evidenced on Zhenyuanlong), may have been flapped by the dromaeosaur in order to stabilize its balance while restraining prey, along with this, the long, feathered tail probably worked as a counter-balance to the main body. Lastly, the snout would have been useful for finishing off its prey. With these observations, they established that dromaeosaurids and troodontids were niche partitioned as large and small prey predators, respectively. Paleoenvironment Achillobator compared to the known dinosaurs of the Bayan Shireh Formation (Achillobator in dark yellow, second from right) The remains of Achillobator were unearthed from the Burkhant locality at the Bayan Shireh Formation. This formation has been divided into upper and lower parts, with some localities representing Lower and Upper Cretaceous boundary. Burkhant, the type locality of Achillobator, has been identified as a Upper Cretaceous-boundary locality. Analyses on the magnetostratigraphy of the formation indicate that the entire Bayan Shireh lies within the Cretaceous Long Normal, which lasted only until the end of the Santonian stage, giving a Cenomanian-Santonian age. The recent calcite U‚ÄìPb analyses performed by Kurudama and colleagues in 2020 have confirm the age of the Bayan Shireh Formation from 95.9 ¬± 6.0 million to 89.6 ¬± 4.0 million years ago, also supporting a Cenomanian-Santonian age. Over the time, a strong correlation with the Iren Dabasu Formation has been proposed by numerous authors mainly based on the similar fossil assemblages. This hypothesis may be also supported by the similar ages. The presence of caliche, fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation at various localities indicates a semi-arid climate with large water bodies, such as rivers, lakes and streams. The Bayan Shireh Formation was considered to be partially lacustrine by Samoilov and Benjamini in 1996, however, large scale cross-stratifications on various sandstone layers at the Baynshire locality are indicators of prominent meanders, in addition to this, it is implied that the presence of large river bodies drained the eastern part of the Gobi Desert. The cornaceans Bothrocaryum gobience and Nyssoidea mongolica have been reported from the Khara Khutul locality, which has also yielded the therizinosaurs Enigmosaurus and Segnosaurus. Additional findings on this locality and Bor Guv√© seem to reflect the large presence of angiosperm plants across the formation, with numerous fossil fruits recovered which bear a superficial resemblance to the modern-day okra, however, the taxonomic affinities are quite unclear. =Contemporaneous paleofauna= pack surrounding an adult Talarurus Paleofauna that were contemporaneous with Achillobator in the Bayan Shireh Formation included the medium-sized theropods Erlikosaurus, Garudimimus, Segnosaurus and possibly Alectrosaurus. Heavy-built ankylosaurs Talarurus and Tsagantegia. Small marginocephalians Amtocephale and Graciliceratops. The basal hadrosauroid Gobihadros and the large, long-necked sauropod Erketu. Non-dinosaur taxa was present as well, mostly compromising semiaquatic and terrestrial reptiles like the turtles Lindholmemys, Gobiapalone and \\"Trionyx\\". Crocodylomorphs are represented by Paralligator and a reported ichnotaxon that was made by a swimming individual. Fishes are also known from the formation. The primitive sharks Hybodus and the remains of osteichthyan fish at various localities are fine representatives. Apparently, there was niche partitioning among species, such is the case of high browser therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus, or the grazer Talarurus and browser Tsagantegia. Erketu, a long necked sauropod from the formation, may have been the tallest herbivore. While other dromaeosaurids filled a variety of specialized ecological niches like the slender unenlagiines, Achillobator retained a conservative life-style and filled the niche of large-bodied predator of often medium to large-sized prey. The re-examination of the maxillae in eudromaeosaur taxa indicates that Asian and North American eudromaeosaurs were separated by snout morphology and ecological strategies. The maxilla is apparently a reliable reference when inferring the shape of the premaxilla and overall snout. For instance, most Asian species have elongated snouts based on the maxilla (animals like Velociraptor are known from complete skulls though), indicating a selective feeding, such as picking up small, fast prey. Achillobator however, is an exception for Asian eudromaeosaurs, featuring robust and deep maxillar morphology and thus indicating a strong connection and relationships to North American members, which also have stocky and deep snouts. The adaptations of Achillobator and North American eudromaeosaurs demonstrate a conservative ecology mainly based on large-sized prey.

The only known species is V. karibaensis. Discovered in 1969 in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe), it was regarded as the earliest-known sauropod for decades, and is still one of the most primitive sauropods that has been discovered. As a quadrupedal, ground- dwelling herbivore, Vulcanodon already showed the typical sauropod body plan with column-like legs and a long neck and tail. It was smaller than most other sauropods, measuring approximately in length. Vulcanodon is known from a fragmentary skeleton including much of the pelvic girdle, hindlimbs, forearms, and tail, but lacking the trunk and neck vertebrae as well as the skull. Originally, this genus was believed to be a prosauropod because of the knife- shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted. Description Size comparison Vulcanodon was a small sauropod. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at eleven metres, its weight at 3.5 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 172 Some books mention lower estimates of approximately . The thighbone was long. As one of the earliest and basalmost sauropods, it is important for understanding the early evolution of this group. Sauropods descend from basal sauropodomorphs (informally called \\"prosauropods\\"), which were primitively bipedal (two-legged). While Vulcanodon already was fully quadrupedal (four-legged), its limb proportions were intermediate between those of its prosauropod ancestors and those of later, more derived sauropods. Its forelimbs were much more similar to later sauropods than basal sauropodomorphs because they are straight, much more gracile, and the proximal end of the ulna is v-shaped. Unfortunately, no skull or neck of Vulcanodon is known, although it is otherwise very well known. =Hindlimbs and pelvis= Plastic model of a herd in the JuraPark in Solec Kujawski, Poland Vulcanodons limbs were sturdy and column-like, and its forelimbs were already proportionally long, reaching 76% of hindlimb length. Its lower leg, metatarsus, and toes were shortened in comparison to its bipedal ancestors, but still not as short as in later sauropods. The sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae; \\"prosauropods\\" possessed only three sacrals. The tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their lateral sides, saving weight and giving them a waisted appearance when viewed from below. In later sauropods, this excavations were enlarged to form extensive perforated pockets called pleurocoels. Contrasting the many sauropod-like features of the skeleton, the pelvis was relatively primitive, reminiscent of its \\"prosauropod\\" ancestors. One such feature is that the brevis shelf of the ilium has a fossa, which is not found in any more derived sauropods. The hallux (the first toe of the foot) showed a large claw that was flattened laterally, as seen in \\"prosauropods\\". However, the claws of the second and third toe were unusual in being nail-like and broader than deep. This feature was also found in the probably closely related Tazoudasaurus, but is absent in all other sauropods. The feet of Vulcanodon were semiplantigrade as in later sauropods (where both the digits and part of the metatarsals contact the ground), a derived feature not found in more basal sauropods like Isanosaurus. However, they also retained primitive features, like the fact that the phalanges were not reduced. Many of the features found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack are related to the change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb. Discovery Vulcanodon is known only from a single locality on an island in Lake Kariba, the largest artificial lake in the world, in northern Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia). The island, located west of Bumi Hills, is called \\"Island 126/127\\", after early, unpublished lake charts, but has no formal name. The first bone was found by B. A. Gibson of the town of Kariba in July 1969, and an excavation team collected the specimen in October 1969, March 1970 and May 1970. In the later half of 1970, the new find was presented at a scientific symposium in Cape Town and a brief note was published. The find was formally named and described in July 1972 by palaeontologist Michael Raath. The name Vulcanodon (lat. Vulcanus ‚Äì Roman god of fire; gr. odon ‚Äì \\"tooth\\") points to the fact that the skeleton was found in sandstone, that was at the time misinterpreted to be part of the Batoka Formation but is actually part of the Forest Sandstone lays a few metres below the lava flows of the Batoka Formation, and emphasizes the peculiar knife-shaped teeth that are now known to belong to a theropod. The specific name, karibaensis, refers to the place of discovery on a small island in Lake Kariba. It was one of the first dinosaurs found in Zimbabwe. The skeleton (catalogue number QG24) has been found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left hind limb and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both the right and left forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. Raath (1972) noted the discovery of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with the head and neck bended backwards above the pelvis, a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Classification {style=\\"margin-left: 1em;; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 248px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px; background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #000000; float: right; \\"  Basal sauropod phylogeny, simplified after Allain and Aquesbi, 2008 } Originally, Michael Raath (1972) described Vulcanodon not as a sauropod but as an advanced, specialized prosauropod, possibly of the family Melanorosauridae. According to Raath, the sauropod-like limb proportions in Vulcanodon evolved independently from those of true sauropods (through convergent evolution). He argued that primitive features of the pelvis as well as the knife-shaped teeth preclude a classification within the Sauropoda. The teeth, however, are now known to belong to a theropod. Arthur Cruickshank (1975) was the first to show that Vulcanodon was indeed a sauropod, arguing that the fifth metatarsal bone was equally long as the remaining metatarsals, a condition seen in other sauropods but not in prosauropods. Today, Vulcanodon is universally accepted to be one of the most basal (primitive) members of Sauropoda. Michael Cooper (1984) erected a new family, the Vulcanodontidae, which he regarded as the \\"rootstock\\" for later sauropod families. Originally, the Vulcanodontidae included Vulcanodon and the Indian Barapasaurus, but subsequent studies attributed a number of other, much more fragmentary early sauropod genera to this family, including Ohmdenosaurus and Zizhongosaurus. Paul Upchurch (1995) showed that Barapasaurus was more closely related to later, more advanced sauropods than to Vulcanodon, rendering the Vulcanodontidae polyphyletic and therefore invalid. The exact relationships with other basal sauropod genera remain unclear. Ronan Allain and colleagues (2004, 2008) found that Vulcanodon is most closely related to Tazoudasaurus, a newly discovered sauropod genus from Morocco. These researchers suggested reintroducing the name Vulcanodontidae to name the clade containing Vulcanodon and Tazoudasaurus. However, this sibling relationship between Tazoudasaurus and Vulcanodon could not be confirmed by other analyses. Adam Yates (2004) described a single sauropod tail vertebra from the Upper Elliot Formation of South Africa that may belong to a genus closely related to Vulcanodon. The Upper Elliot Formation is famous for its abundant fossils of the prosauropod Massospondylus. Paleoecology Artist's impression of an individual During the later part of the Lower Jurassic, southern Africa was the scene of massive volcanism, resulting in extensive lava flows (so called flood basalts) that covered much of southern Africa and Antarctica. These basalt formations are known as the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province. Vulcanodon comes from the \\"Vulcanodon beds\\", a fossil-bearing sediment unit within the Batoka Formation, which is composed primarily of flood basalts. The skeleton was found near the top of a bedded layer of sand- and siltstone that is over- and underlain by flood basalts. It was long assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the lowermost (earliest) part of the Jurassic (the Hettangian stage) or at the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic boundary, approximately 200 million years ago. Therefore, it was regarded as the earliest sauropod known, until the discovery of the even older Late Triassic Isanosaurus was announced in 2000. Adam Yates (2004) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought, dating to the uppermost (latest) part of the Lower Jurassic during the Toarcian stage, approximately 175‚Äì183 million years ago. Thus, it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus. Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas, it would roughly be a contemporary to Karoo lavas from other localities, as the entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years. Vulcanodon is the only named dinosaur from the Vulcanodon beds. Cooper (1984) noted that the habitat was desert-like, as indicated by aeolian (wind-blown) sands of the Forest Sandstone Formation, which underlies the \\"Vulcanodon beds\\". The sediments in which Vulcanodon was found may represent distal alluvial fan deposits which levelled off into a desert landscape, which may have contained lakes during the wet season. The individual may have roamed the shores of wadis that cut into the alluvial fan deposits, unless the carcass was transported to the locality it was found by flooding. Initially, sauropods were thought to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the buoyancy of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.

Geologist Hans Mohr of the technical college in Graz argued, in 1920, that: Mohr 1920, p. 44. Hungarian- born Austrian teacher Benno Immend√∂rfer argued for the integration of Burgenland into Austria to secure Austria's supply of food, stating that: Immend√∂rfer 1919, p. 41. However, according to Hungarians, there were no antecedents for an Austrian takeover and integration of Burgenland. It was argued that places in Burgenland like Kismarton/Eisenstadt and Frakn√≥/Forchenstein had been Hungarian royal domains for centuries. Burgenland had only been partly Germanized due to Austrian influence, and the original ancestors of its inhabitants were Hungarians, sent to protect the Hungarian borderlands. Until the Treaty of St Germain, Burgenland had been a part of Hungary. History =After the Hungarian Soviet Republic= After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, P√°l Pr√≥nay formed a small army of decommissioned officers and soldiers. These soldiers were responsible for the torture and execution of left-wing figures and people in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, as well as the Central Hungarian countryside (known as the White Terror) in response to the actions of the Lenin Boys led by Tibor Szamuely (known as the Red Terror). This band of soldiers was a predecessor of the Rongyos G√°rda. Soon, former admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy rose to the rank of Regent. The last King of Hungary IV. Karoly (Karl I of Austria) returned to Hungary and attempted to restore himself to the throne, but due to the ban on Habsburg restoration placed by the victorious Allied Powers, Horthy did not comply. Many Habsburg legitimists wanted his return, especially in Western Hungary, which would lead to the foundation of the Karlist faction in Lajtab√°ns√°g. =Burgenland after the Treaty of Trianon= Map of the Treaty of Trianon According to the Treaty of Trianon and the Treaty of Saint-Germain, several territories of Western Hungary was to be taken from the Kingdom of Hungary by Austria on August 19th, 1921. In order to retain his position and power, Horthy was forced to accept the terms of the treaty. The Hungarian government hoped that they would be able to change the treaty and settle the hand-over by referendum, but their proposals were rejected by Austrian Chancellor Karl Renner multiple times. In January 1921, the Austrian National Assembly agreed to integrate the newly granted West Hungarian territory into Austria as Burgenland, a new federation state ((Bundes)land). =Creation of the Rongyos G√°rda= The Rongyos G√°rda in 1921 Ivan H√©jjas, one of the leaders of the Rongyos G√°rda In 1921, P√°l Pr√≥nay started to organize a new paramilitary force - the Rongyos G√°rda (Tattered/Scrubby Guard). The guard was organized (some sources say that it was organized in secret) and worked with the tacit consent of the Hungarian government. The insurgents were civilians, replacing military caps with a hood, the rim of which was fastened to the top of the hat with a cockade in the national colors of Hungary. The Rongyos G√°rda consisted of peasants, college students, decommissioned military officers and Bosnian-Albanian Muslims who fought for the Kingdom of Hungary before Trianon (among them was Major Durics Hilmi Huszein, with nearly 300 associates). Aside from Pr√≥nay, Ivan H√©jjas was also a major figure and leader of the Rongyos G√°rda. Young people from all over Hungary joined the Rongyos G√°rda to fight for Western Hungary, but hardly any of them were actually from the region. A Rongyos G√°rda uniform (worn by Francia Kiss Mih√°ly) In 1921, Count Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek's hunter-battalion was stationed in Sopron. This unit did not belong to the Rongyos G√°rda, but was a part of the Hungarian Army. It a battalion available to be controlled by the Entente committee in Sopron, helping them to control the evacuation and surrender of the area. Aside from this battalion, the Hungarian army did not have any presence in the territory. =West Hungarian Uprising= korona stamp Lajtab√°ns√°g 10 korona stamp, featuring Pr√≥nay's face On the 19th of August, 1921, the area was supposed to be handed over, but it was not, due to military resistance from the Rongyos G√°rda. On August 28th, an uprising started, with the Rongyos G√°rda engaging in battle with the Austrian gendarmerie and a firefight starting at √Ågfalva between the Austrians and 120 of H√©jjas's men (the Great Plain Brigade). The Hungarian forces fought a guerrilla war against the Austrians, making it virtually impossible for Austria to take the territory. To the East of Sopron, there were rebels in every village. The Royal Hungarian Army had to evacuate due to the post-war treaties, and the Hungarian government had little control over the Rongyos G√°rda. Former Prime Minister Istv√°n Friedrich was involved, leading guerrillas at Kismarton (Eisenstadt). Horthy appointed Gyula G√∂mb√∂s as a regional commander in Western Hungary, with the task of regulating the Rongyos G√°rda. However, both H√©jjas and Friedrich refused to answer to G√∂mb√∂s, retaining their autonomous actions. Pr√≥nay's main goal was to implement the Sigray-Lingauer Plan, formulated by Count Antal Sigray according to which, if the Hungarian government agreed with Austria in renouncing Western Hungary, the rebels would create an independent state called the Lajub. The title of Ban would have been given to Sigray or Archduke Albrecht Franz, Duke of Teschen. However, a referendum was in reach, so the Prime Minister dissuaded Sigray from his plan. On October 3rd, 1921, Burgenland came under the de jure jurisdiction of the Entente (they had previously handed over control to the Austrians). On the 4th of October, the Republic of Lajtab√°ns√°g was declared in Fels≈ë≈ër (Oberwart), which issued its own stamps and identification. Pr√≥nay's goal was now eventually rejoin Hungary after a plebiscite, writing in his memoirs that \\"In order to save Western Hungary, I have created an independent Lajtab√°ns√°g.\\"Fogarassy L√°szl√≥: Pr√≥nay P√°l eml√©kez√©sei az 1921. √©vi nyugat- magyarorsz√°gi esem√©nyekr≈ël Trains between Austria and Hungary had to pay customs duties in the form of goods being taken off carriages.Republik f√ºr ein paar Stunden - Wiener Zeitung A total of 79 postage stamps and 6 postage due stamps were issued, which initially did not have watermarks.Westungarn.

A dispute started between the \\"free King-electors\\", who wanted to elect a monarch, which was the faction Pr√≥nay and H√©jjas belonged to, and the Karlists, who supported the restoration of the Austrian Emperor and Hungarian King Karl I, which was the faction Istv√°n Friedrich belonged to. Additionally, the Hungarian government also exerted pressure on Lajtab√°ns√°g to avoid sanctions from the Allied Powers. The \\"Operetta-state\\"Andreas Moritsch (Hrsg.): Vom Ethnos zur Nationalit√§t. Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 1991, , S. 111. ended with the departure of the guerrillas on November 10th, 1921 and the final engagement of the Austrian gendarmerie. Previously, to solve the situation, on October 11th and 12th, 1921, the Austrians began negotiations with Hungary in Venice. According to this agreement, the referendum must be held in Sopron, as well as 8 other villages as a condition for Lajtab√°ns√°g to be dissolved. Prime Minister Istv√°n Bethlen issued a letter to Sopron to order a withdrawal of the insurgents, which read: Fogarassy L√°szl√≥: Pr√≥nay P√°l eml√©kez√©sei az 1921. √©vi nyugat- magyarorsz√°gi esem√©nyekr≈ël - Gr√≥f Bethlen minisztereln√∂k levele. The fate of Sopron and the surrounding areas were handled by referendum and Lajtab√°ns√°g was dissolved. Pr√≥nay later formed extremist right-wing organizations. On March 20th, 1945, the Soviets captured him and took him away from Hungary. The place and time of his death are unknown. Government Fels≈ë≈ër became the center and capital of Lajtab√°ns√°g, as it had a majority Hungarian population. Lajtab√°ns√°g's independence was declared before the Fels≈ë≈ër church. Pr√≥nay became the leader of the revolt. Captain L√°szl√≥ Ap√°thy was appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors and Rapporteur on Religious Affairs, Ferenc L√©vay was Lecturer on Foreign Affairs and Justice Lieutenant, Captain B√©la B√°rdos was Attorney-at-Law, Lieutenant Gy√∂rgy Hir, member of the Hungarian National Assembly was Lecturer on Economic Affairs. The government needed money, but there was little to hope for in tax collection, as the area declared self- sufficient was small and the rebels had already looted it. However, tax collectors paid a hefty price for stamps printed at printing houses in Pest. Lajtab√°ns√°g was not the first uprising in the region - previously, the 1918 Republic of Heinzenland and the 1919 Republic of Prekmurje were declared as independent countries by regional forces.

Some documents have been preserved in the Hungarian National Archives, some of which were partially destroyed in 1945. Pr√≥nay found about 15 letters of correspondence between Gyula G√∂mb√∂s and the leading council of the Etelk√∂zi Sz√∂vets√©g.

It is maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). The highway runs from US 64/US 71B east to Highway 7 in Dardanelle. Following the historic stagecoach line of the cross- country Butterfield Trail, the highway is one of the original 1926 state highways. It is designated by the AHTD as the True Grit Trail. Route description The route begins in Fort Smith at US 64/US 71B. It runs east, crossing I-540/US 71 and the incomplete interchange at the northern end of future I-49. From its western terminus in Fort Smith it carries the Seminole route of the Trail of Tears to AR 255 where the historic route follows AR 255 heading north. From the junction with AR 255, AR 22 concurs with AR 255 through Fort Chaffee and intersects AR 96 east of the installation. The route next enters Charleston where it meets AR 217 and the historic Butterfield Trail. The historic route continues along AR 22 to its eastern terminus in Dardanelle. Continuing east into Branch the highway crosses AR 41. County Line High School is located on the highway between Branch and Ratcliff. Highway 22 east of Barling In the town of Caulksville AR 22 has a junction with AR 23\\\\. Continuing east into the city of Paris the highway has junctions with AR 109, AR 288, and AR 309\\\\. AR 22/AR 109/AR 288 run together until Subiaco, when the route loses AR 288 but crosses AR 197. AR 109 leaves AR 22 in Midway, heading north towards Clarksville. AR 22 continues alone to Dardanelle, passing through the communities of New Blaine and Delaware along the way. In Dardanelle, the route terminates at AR 7 after a very brief concurrency with AR 155. The road itself is fairly straight and in reasonably good repair. Passing can be safely accomplished in several stretches of Highway 22 despite a lack of constructed passing areas. History The precursor to today's AR 22 was the Butterfield Trail, a stagecoach trail officially known as the Overland Mail Company that traveled roughly along the present-day highway's route from Dardanelle to Fort Smith. The stagecoach carried mail and passengers from Memphis to Fort Smith. In Fort Smith the trail split into two routes, with one traveling west to San Francisco and the other traveling north to St. Louis. The Butterfield Trail was in operation from 1858 to 1861. Upon its establishment, AR 22 was one of the original 1926 Arkansas state highways. AR 22 ran from Fort Smith to Dardanelle along a routing very similar to the modern-day routing of AR 22. On July 14, 2015 the highway was linked to Future I-49 in Barling. In June 2019 a proposal was made under the Connecting Arkansas Program-2 for US$25 million to be allocated to the improvement of sections of AR 22 between Fort Smith and Charleston. on November 14 of the same year the highway was officially designated by the AHTD as the True Grit Trail. The name comes from the 1968 novel, True Grit by Charles Portis where the protagonist, Mattie Ross, travels along Highway 22 from Dardanelle to Fort Smith. =National Register of Historic Places= Three original segments of Highway 22 remain intact and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The New Blaine segment was listed in 2003, the Barling segment was listed in May 2007, and the Yell County segment was listed in 2008. All three listings are contained within the Arkansas Highway History and Architecture Multiple Property Submission, which preserves history from Arkansas's highway building era between 1910 and 1965. On Barling The Old Arkansas 22, Barling Segment is a historic section of roadway in Barling, Arkansas. Now named Mayo Drive, it consists of a stretch of concrete pavement, two lanes wide, in the northwestern part of the city. It extends north from the current alignment of Highway 22 until it reaches a sharp curve, where the pavement narrows significantly, before continuing westward to rejoin the highway. This stretch of pavement was constructed in 1928 by the Koss Construction Company, and is longest section of surviving pavement of the early alignment of Highway 22. New Blaine Old Arkansas Highway 22 is a historic roadway section in New Blaine, Arkansas. It consists of an S-shaped section asphalt, in length, built in 1930 by Cook & Ransom and the Schultz Construction Company to carry Highway 22\\\\. This section was bypassed by the present alignment in the 1960s. It is now designated as part of Arkansas Highway 197, the AR 197 Loop, and Rainbow Loop, and continues to provide the primary access to the town center. Yell County One surviving element of the original alignment survives in Yell County west of Dardanelle; it consists of County Road 906 (CR 906), a stretch of concrete pavement wide. This segment was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
