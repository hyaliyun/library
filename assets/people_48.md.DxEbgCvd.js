Early life and education Born in Cork in 1940, the daughter of mathematics professor T.S. Broderick and a Scottish Presbyterian mother, she was baptised a Catholic but brought up in \\"the Anglican compromise\\" (Church of Ireland). She went up to Trinity College Dublin in 1958 where her contemporaries included the poets Michael Longley, Derek Mahon and Eavan Boland. After her marriage to Michael Longley, she moved with him to Belfast and obtained her first teaching post at Queen's University Belfast. From 1989 to 1994 she was Academic Director of the John Hewitt Summer School. Trinity College Dublin gave her an honorary doctorate in 2003. Her daughter is the artist, Sarah Longley. In Jan 2012 Queen's recognised her importance to the academic life of the university with the unveiling of a portrait of Longley in the Great Hall. Professor Terence Brown, who unveiled the portrait, described her as \\"one of the foremost public intellectuals that Ireland has produced.\\" Academic and Critic Now Professor Emerita at Queen's University Belfast, as a lecturer and later Professor of English at Queen's, Longley was influential in both literary and political culture of Northern Ireland both during and since the years of The Troubles. While she was at the Queen's University, the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry was founded. She gained particular renown in Ireland for her public criticism of \\"depredatory ideologies\\" both in their political and the literary aspects. In her Lip pamphlet From Cathleen to Anorexia (1990) she was scathingly critical of the identification of feminism with Irish nationalism.The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing: Irish women's writing and traditions, edited by Angela Bourke (Cork University Press, 2002) At the Yeats Summer School in 1993 she attacked The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing for 'a propensity to censorship and an obsession with colonialism', developing those arguments in her 1994 collection of essays The Living Stream: Literature and Revisionism in Ireland, an extended critique of nationalism in Irish writing. She has also been one of the foremost scholars in Edward Thomas studies, publishing two editions of his poetry (1973 and 2008) and one of his prose (1981), and is one of the editors of the planned Oxford University Press series, Edward Thomas: The Essential Prose.

She served in the North Sea and the Baltic until the British 74-gun third rates and destroyed her in 1808 during the Anglo- Russian War (1807‚Äì1812). Service On 3 July 1798 Vsevolod was at Arkhangel‚Äôsk, serving as flagship for Vice-Adm. Thate, who commanded the 2nd Division of the Imperial Russian Navy. She then arrived at the Nore on 8 August and operated in the North Sea and off the Texel for almost three years. She returned to Kronstadt on 21 July 1800. She then carried supplies to Revel'. She then served in the Baltic before undergoing repairs in 1804. In September 1805 she transported troops to Pomerania. =Anglo-Russian War and loss= In early 1808 Russia initiated the Finnish War in response to Sweden's refusal to bow to Russian pressure to join the anti-British alliance. Russia captured Finland and made it a Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire. The British decided to take counter-measures and in May sent a fleet under Vice- Admiral Sir James Saumarez to the Baltic. On 9 July, the Russian fleet, under Admiral Peter Khanykov, came out from Kronstadt. The Swedes massed a fleet under Swedish Admiral Rudolf Cederstr√∂m, consisting of 11 line-of-battle ships and 5 frigates at √ñr√∂ and Jungfrusund to oppose them. On 16 August, Saumarez then sent Centaur, Captain William Henry Webley, and Implacable, Captain Thomas Byam Martin, to join the Swedish fleet. They chased two Russian frigates on 19 July and joined the Swedes the following day. On 22 August, the Russian fleet, consisting of nine ships of the line, five large frigates and six smaller ones, moved from Hanko to threaten the Swedes. The Swedes, with the two British ships, grouped at √ñr√∂, and three days later sailed to meet the Russians. The Russians and the Anglo-Swedish force were fairly evenly matched, but the Russians retreated and the Allied ships followed them. Centaur and Implacable were better vessels than the Swedish ships and slowly pulled ahead, with Implacable catching up with Vsevolod, which was straggling. On Vsevolod, under Captain Rudno (or Rudnew or Roodneff) exchanged fire with Implacable, with the Russian suffering heavy casualties before running aground. During this exchange three nearby Russian ships failed to render assistance. Vsevolod hauled down her colors, but Hood recalled Implacable because the Russian fleet was approaching. During the fight Implacable lost six men killed and twenty- six wounded, including two who did not recover and three who had limbs amputated.; Vsevolod lost some 48 dead and 80 wounded. The Russian frigate Poluks then towed Vsevolod towards Rager Vik (Ragerswik or Rogerswick or Russian: Baltiyskiy) where the Russian fleet was sheltering. However, Vsevolod grounded some six miles from the port. On Centaur came up and was able to drive off the boats that were attempting to get the disabled ship into harbor. Seamen from Centaur were able to lash her mizzen to the Russian bowsprit before Centaur opened fire. Both vessels grounded, and both sides attempted to board the other vessel. However, Implacable came up and fired into Vsevolod for about 10 minutes, forcing the Russian to strike again. Implacable hauled Centaur off. The battle had cost Centaur three killed and 27 wounded. Vsevolod, which had received about 100 men as reinforcements after her initial battle with Implacable, lost another 124 men killed and wounded in the battle with Centaur; 56 Russians swam ashore and so escaped being taken prisoner. Their prize was so firmly aground that Sir Samuel Hood, in Centaur, ordered Vsevolod burnt. On the British removed their prisoners, including the wounded, and then set fire to Vsevolod, which blew up some hours later. The cutter Baltic would later land the prisoners. \\"Burning of the Sewolod\\" by James Ralfe =Aftermath= Vice-Admiral Saumerez with his entire squadron joined the Anglo-Swedish squadron the next day. They then blockaded Khanykov's squadron at (Baltiyskiy). for some months. After the British and the Swedes abandoned the blockade, the Russian fleet was able to return to Kronstadt. The Russian government court-martialed Admiral Khanykov for what the British Admiralty would have labeled as \\"failure to do his utmost\\". The court martial ordered Khanykov demoted to the rank of Ordinary Seaman for one day and dismissed from the service. What saved Khanykov from a more severe sentence was his earlier distinguished service. His Swedish Majesty Gustaf IV Adolf conferred upon Captain Martin of Implacable the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Sword. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Implacable 26 Augt. 1808\\" and \\"Centaur 26 Augt. 1808\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Hood took Vsevolods flag as a trophy and it ended up hanging in the main hall of the Hood family home \\"St. Audries\\".

His life is only known through the Alexiad of Anna Komnene and the history of her husband, Nikephoros Bryennios. Biography Michael Doukas was born circa 1061, the eldest son of the domestikos ton scholon Andronikos Doukas, son of the Caesar John Doukas, and his wife, Maria of Bulgaria, the granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria. Michael was thus the brother-in-law of Alexios I Komnenos, who had married his sister Irene Doukaina.; .; . In 1074, during the rebellion of the Norman mercenary Roussel de Bailleul, Michael and his younger brother John were at the estates of the Caesar John Doukas in Bithynia. Roussel demanded that the Caesar give up the two as hostages in return for releasing their wounded father, whom he held captive. The Caesar agreed, and the two were imprisoned by Roussel. The slave servants of the two boys managed to persuade a local peasant to help them escape and lead them to Nicomedia, but in the event, only Michael with his eunuch pedagogue Leontakios managed to escape and reach safety. His brother John remained behind, until he was liberated after Roussel's defeat later in the year.; . Miniature of the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118). In 1078, he played a crucial role in the marriage of Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078‚Äì1081) to the Empress Maria of Alania. The marriage was against canon law, as she was still married to the recently deposed emperor Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071‚Äì1078), but on the instructions of his grandfather the Caesar, Michael procured a priest willing to conduct the ceremony.; . In 1081, when Alexios Komnenos rebelled against Botaneiates, Michael accompanied the Caesar to Alexios's camp at Schiza. There, they supported Alexios's candidacy for the Byzantine throne against his elder brother Isaac Komnenos.; . After Alexios's successful accession to the throne, Michael was rewarded with the title of sebastos and the office of protostrator, one of the Byzantine Empire's highest military positions. In 1083, he participated in the campaign in Thessaly against the Normans under Bohemund, commanding the heavy infantry. He was defeated in battle by Bohemund near Larissa, and his army scattered. Four years later, he participated in the failed expedition against the Pechenegs in Bulgaria, and urged the emperor Alexios to flee after the Byzantine defeat at Dorystolon. During the flight, Michael's horse slipped and he fell, but a soldier gave him his own horse, allowing him to rejoin the emperor's party. A few years later, however, in 1091, he participated in the final victory over the Pechenegs at the Battle of Levounion.; . After that, he is recorded as having attended the synod of 1094 that condemned Leo of Chalcedon, and in a letter during the Norman invasion of 1107‚Äì1108, according to which Michael was dispatched to Epirus to raise troops. He died after a prolonged illness on a 9 January. The year is unknown, however it was sometime before 1117 when he is listed as dead in the typikon of the Kecharitomene Monastery.; . Family Through his marriage to an unnamed woman, he had several children. Only one is attested with certainty, Constantine Doukas, a sebastos and governor of the region of the Vardar river circa 1118.; . Demetrios I. Polemis further identifies two Doukas women as two of Michael's daughters. The first is a certain Theodora Doukaina, attested in an epigram as married to a Theodore. Polemis considers her as the mother of Euphrosyne Doukaina, Michael's granddaughter, whose father was also named Theodore.; . The second is Irene Doukaina, the wife of Gregory Kamateros, a man of humble origin who rose to high office under Alexios Komnenos and his successor, John II Komnenos (r. 1118‚Äì1143).; . Another daughter, married to a certain John, is unnamed, and it is possible that a poem by Nicholas Kallikles refers to another son..

In October 1948, after being awarded a State Scholarship, he started an accelerated applied mathematics degree course at Imperial College of Science and Technology of the University of London. In 1951, he be able to attend a two-week course at Cambridge University given by Dr. Maurice Wilkes, the developer of the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). Gilchrist recalls that \\"this was my first real exposure to computer programming, the problems of debugging, etc.\\".  Institute for Advanced Study  In the summer of 1952, he received his doctorate in Meteorology at the University of London. That same year, with a special interest in calculating methods for weather forecasting, and with funding arranged by the mathematician John von Neumann, he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey supported on United States Smith-Mundt and Fulbright programs. He worked with Dr. Jule Charney, a gifted meteorologist and mathematician, on weather prediction calculations, programming the institute's IAS machine. He also worked in the area of computers at IAS. Gilchrist first collaborated with the engineer James H. Pomerene on bettering the performance of cathode ray tube memory (the Williams tube developed first at the University of Manchester in England), writing diagnostic programs which allowed the team to make necessary adjustments for speed and reliability. Further collaborating with Pomerene and Y.K. Wong, they invented a fast adder which incorporated a speed up technique for asynchronous adders reducing the time for additive carry-overs to propagate. This design was actually later incorporated in one commercial computer, the Philco TRANSAC S-2000, introduced in 1957, the first commercial transistorized computer.Gilchrist, Bruce, \\"Remembering Some Early Computers, 1948-1960\\" , Columbia University EPIC, 2006, pp.7-9. Gilchrist was married in Princeton in April 1954 and his eldest son, Ian, was born there in February 1956. In 1955, John von Neumann left the Institute for Advanced Study to join the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and so, in the summer of 1956, the group Gilchrist had been working with, broke up.  Later career  In 1956, Gilchrist accepted an invitation to be an assistant professor of mathematics and the first director of the computer center at Syracuse University where they had ordered an IBM 650 computer which was delivered a few months after he arrived that summer. Some time after, he also became involved with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and was elected to its national Council in 1958. This volunteer work put him into contact with a wide variety of computer users across the United States. In the spring of 1959, he was asked by Dr. Herman H. Goldstine, to join him at IBM Research as manager of the computing facility. So, Gilchrist joined IBM in 1959 where some years later he later became director of planning with its service bureau subsidiary, Service Bureau Corporation (SBC), from 1963 to 1965. From 1965 to 1968, he was a manager of IBM's Data Processing Division. Gilchrist served as secretary (1960‚Äì1962) and vice president (1962‚Äì1964) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

He was previously President of Concordia Lutheran College in Austin and Concordia Theological Seminary in Illinois.  Early life  Beto was born in Hysham, Montana on January 19, 1916. He was raised in Bloomington, Indiana.  Texas Department of Corrections  Beto was appointed to the Texas Prison Board in 1953 by Allan Shivers and became director in 1961. In his career, he greatly expanded the industry of prison-manufactured goods, and oversaw the construction of new prison facilities. Beto advocated for the establishment of a school district serving prisoners; in 1969 the Texas Legislature authorized the establishment of the Windham School District. During his career Beto received awards for his management of the TDC. :Although many inmates admired him for his willingness to communicate with them, they also regarded him as a stern disciplinarian, a \\"preacher\\" with \\"a baseball bat in one hand and a Bible in the other.\\" = Criticism = Beto was a master of publicity and well-regarded by the media for his modernization of prisons. However, he faced criticism by those criticizing his cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners and denial of prisoners' access to their attorneys. Towards the end of Beto's career as the head of TDC, attorney Frances Freeman Jalet assisted Fred Cruz and other prisoners who were planning legal challenges to the TDC system. On two occasions Beto banned her from the TDC units, but court orders forced the TDC to let her back in. Beto then arranged to have three trustees sue Jalet in federal court; the lawsuit said that Jalet incited revolutionary violence and imperiled the lives of the prisoners. Beto lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay $10,291 to Jalet and the prisoners, and $27,825 for their attorney fees, with the judge commenting that \\"...Beto instituted reprisals against Mrs. Cruz and ‚Ä¶ her clients, for reasons totally unrelated to considerations of proper prison administration.\\" In the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case Cruz v. Beto the court upheld a Free Exercise claim of discrimination against a Buddhist prisoner, Fred Cruz. In early 1972 Beto announced that he planned to resign from TDC, but was still director on June 29, 1972, when prisoner David Ruiz filed a handwritten petition against conditions of confinement in Texas prisons that became Ruiz v. Estelle - the most enduring prisoners'-rights suit in the nation's history.  Later life  He was then Professor of Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville for several years. Upon retirement from that position he moved to Austin, where he died about a year later of a heart attack.

Droste relocated from his hometown of Hamburg to Berlin in 1919. He earned a living as a naked dancer, choreographer and expressionist poet. His first poem appeared in Der Sturm that same year, and a further 15 poems and ‚Äògrotesques‚Äô of his were published in the journal between then and 1923. In 1922, Droste married expressionist exotic dancer and actress in silent movies of the Berlin scene, Anita Berber. She and Droste performed fantasias with titles such as \\"Suicide,\\" \\"Morphium,\\" and \\"Mad House\\". Droste appeared as a dancer in the silent movie Algol. In 1923, Droste and Berber jointly published a book of poetry, photographs, and drawings called Die T√§nze des Lasters, des Grauens und der Ekstase (Dances of Vice, Horror, and Ecstasy), based on their performance of the same name. Full of expressionist imagery, the book offered a glimpse into the angst and cynicism shadowing their artistic and personal existences. Their marriage ended in 1923.

It was adopted by delegates to a Constitutional Convention in February 1901, but the United States, then exercising military authority over Cuba following the end of Cuba's war for independence from Spain, withheld its approval until the Convention amended the Constitution in June to incorporate language from a U.S. statute, the Platt Amendment, that placed limitations on Cuban sovereignty and provided a legal basis for future U.S. military interventions in Cuba. Constitutional Convention General Leonard Wood, the U.S. military governor of Cuba, called for a constitutional convention to meet in September 1900. It met for the first time on 5 November 1900, in Havana. Wood opened the meeting by charging its thirty-one delegates with writing a constitution and formulating the future relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. presided and Enrique Villuendas and Alfredo Zayas served as secretaries. The convention's central committee produced a first draft of the constitution in January, and it failed to mention the United States. In early February the U.S. government expressed its displeasure at the Convention's failure to address the question of Cuban-American relations and its presumption that elections would occur 90 days after the constitution is adopted without giving any consideration, in the words of The New York Times, \\"as to whether the United States will be satisfied\\" with the document. A spokesman for the McKinley administration said: The convention approved the text of the constitution on 21 February 1901, without adopting the language the U.S. government was insisting on. Modeled on the U.S. Constitution (1789), it divided the government into three branches: *The bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and House of Representatives *The judicial branch with a relative independence, but dependent on the executive and sometimes the legislature in terms of their appointments *The executive branch, which concentrated great power under its control The constitution was not submitted to a popular vote. Some in the United States had objected that the document should be subject to popular ratification, both to remove any question that the United States had imposed it by manipulating the Convention delegates and also as a matter of principle: \\"it is the privilege of the people to adopt or reject it; and it will not be securely ordained and established until it has been so adopted by the people\\". Wood, however, had charged the Convention with writing and \\"adopting\\" a constitution. The Convention did that and, without holding a plebiscite, proceeded to establish procedures for elections to fill the offices established by the Constitution. U.S. demands The Platt Amendment was a U.S. statute that authorized the U.S. president to withdraw troops from Cuba following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War once he secured several specific promises from Cuba by treaty. Five provisions set restrictions on Cuban sovereignty and governed relations between the U.S. and Cuba. A sixth declared sovereignty over the Isle of Pines off the coast of the island of Cuba a question to be settled by a later treaty. A seventh guaranteed the U.S. the right to lease land in Cuba to establish naval bases and coaling stations. An eighth required the earlier seven provisions to be agreed to by treaty. The U.S. government attempted to win the adoption of the Platt Amendment's terms by the delegates of the Cuban Constitutional Convention by promising to guarantee Cuban sugar producers access to the U.S. market. The delegates repeatedly rejected the text or sought to find acceptable language to substitute. Wood negotiated with a committee tasked with crafting a text. When they adopted a constitution in February 1901 they failed to include any version of it. The delegates tried to meet the U.S. demand by issuing an \\"opinion\\" on relations with the U.S., but remained in session anticipating it would not be sufficient. As of early April, in one observer's view, the delegates were divided between \\"nationalist sentiment\\" and the \\"sober judgment\\" that advised meeting the U.S. demands, and \\"they continue to beat about the bush for some deliverance from their dilemma, all the time ... drifting slowly but sensible toward an acceptance of the terms of the Platt Amendment.\\" A divided committee of delegates produced two more competing drafts in May. As late as 1 June 1901, the Convention adopted language that Wood warned would not be acceptable, and U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root confirmed that rejection. The delegates finally yielded to American pressure and ratified the Platt Amendment's provisions, first by accepting the report of its drafting committee on a 15 to 14 vote on 28 May, and then as an amendment to the constitution by a vote of 16 to 11 on 12 June 1901. The United States transferred \\"government and control\\" to the government newly elected under the terms of the amended 1901 constitution on 20 May 1902. Cuba removed the Platt Amendment provisions from its constitution on 29 May 1934, as part of a new understanding of relations with the United States under the Good Neighbor policy of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. At the same time, Cuba and the U.S. replaced their 1903 Treaty of Relations that had committed both countries to the Platt Amendment's requirements. Their new 1934 Treaty of Relations preserved only two elements of the earlier pact: * the legality of actions taken by the U.S. in Cuba during its military occupation at the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War * the lease continued unchanged.

He played as a defensive back for University of Michigan from 1997 to 2000 where he won a national championship and three Big Ten Conference championships and for the New York Giants from 2001 to 2002. He has also had small parts in a pair of Hollywood film productions. Early years Patmon attended Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, California. In high school, he was a 6-foot-1, 185-pound free safety for Patrick Henry's football team and was selected as a first-team All-County player by the San Diego Union-Tribune. As a senior in high school, he received numerous scholarship officers and narrowed his choices to Notre Dame, Texas and Michigan. In the end, he said his final decision was easy: \\"I've always been a Michigan fan. I really didn't like South Bend and, although I figured I'd start right away at Texas, I decided I'd rather start three years at a school like Michigan.\\" He later added, \\"As a kid, I wore all the Michigan stuff.\\" University of Michigan Patmon enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1997. He played four years with the Wolverines, from 1997 to 2000, and recorded 186 tackles, including 137 solo tackles. He is tied for fourth all-time-time at the Michigan with 11 career pass interceptions. As a freshman, he played in seven games, and started one game at outside linebacker, for the undefeated national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team's record-setting defense. He was credited by the Associated Press for having played a \\"key role\\" along with William Peterson and James Whitley in Michigan's 21‚Äì16 win over Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl. When Michigan's 1998 co-captain Marcus Ray was suspended by the NCAA for associating with a sports agent, Patmon started 10 games at strong safety for the 1998 team.(\\"Patmon, a sophomore, made 16 tackles and two interceptions in the first three games of Ray's five game suspension. Carr said the job is Patmon's to lose.\\") After a 1998 victory over Michigan State, head coach Lloyd Carr singled out Patmon for praise: \\"In particular, DeWayne Patmon really stepped up and played the finest game of his collegiate career. Patmon's interception on the one-yard line was a big play late in that ballgame as were some of his hits on receivers over the middle.\\" Patmon continued to play at free safety for Michigan, starting eight games for the 1999 team and ten games for the 2000 team. The 1998 and 2000 teams were both Big Ten Conference co-champions. Patmon's final game for Michigan was the 2001 Florida Citrus Bowl in which Michigan defeated Auburn, 31‚Äì28. In the Citrus Bowl, Patmon and sophomore safety Julius Curry each \\"made key interceptions to halt Auburn drives into Michigan territory.\\" New York Giants Patmon went undrafted in the 2001 NFL Draft and signed the following week with the New York Giants of the National Football League as an undrafted free agent. During the 2001 pre-season, Patmon tried out with the Giants seeking a roster spot as \\"gunner\\" on punt coverage team. At the time, Patmon described the role of the \\"gunner\\" as follows: \\"The thing about it is, you've got to forget that it's one-on-two and just pick out one guy and beat him. It's a 10-second fight, one vs. two, and you're using your speed and strength to fight them off. You just try to get them off-balance, outrun them, and see if you can make a play on the ball.\\" He earned a spot on the Giants as a safety. After playing his first game for the Giants against the Denver Broncos, Patmon flew with the team to Newark on September 11, 2001, arriving at 6:00 a.m., before the attack on the World Trade Center. Interviewed by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Patmon said, \\"You can still see all the smoke in the sky from here ... Time is standing still right now. You don't think about the NFL or losing a game to the Broncos at a time like this ... A lot of people are suffering right now. It puts everything else in perspective.\\" Patmon played for the Giants in 2001 and 2002, but was waived in March 2003.(\\"The Giants signed cornerback Ray Green and waived safety DeWayne Patmon.\\") Motion pictures Following his football career, Patmon appeared as a football player in both the 2004 film Friday Night Lights and the 2005 film Two for the Money.

The Ottoman Railway Company (ORC) started construction in late 1856 and completed a line, from the start at Alsancak to Kemer, in 1857. Kemer station was opened. Kemer was chosen to be the main freight depot of the ORC in ƒ∞zmir. When the railway reached the town of Torbalƒ± in 1860, the first trains started to operate on the line. Freight trains carrying mainly figs, would unload at Kemer depot and would be distributed in ƒ∞zmir via horse pulled wagons. Freight trains from the south as well as horse pulled caravans from the east and north would unload at Kemer. In its early years Kemer station was the main freight depot in ƒ∞zmir.

The church building is the only functioning portion of a former 16th century convent. The church is Churrigueresque in style from the 18th century and was part of the convent of Regina Coeli Conceptionist nuns. The former convent was closed during the Reform War and is generally not open to the public. The church is still open to worship and visitors and contains several of its original gilded Churrigueresque altarpieces from the 18th century. One in particular, the altar dedicated to the Virgin of the Fountain is an early, but developed example of the Churrigueresque style. Despite the church‚Äôs status as a national monument, it has had serious conservation problems due to deterioration since the mid 20th century. History The land was ceded to the Conceptionists in 1573 to establish a convent, with official Vatican permission obtained from Pope Gregory XIII in 1578. It was the second convent of this order established in New Spain. The name of Regina Coeli is derived from a prayer directed to the Virgin Mary during Easter, referring to Mary‚Äôs participation in the Resurrection of Jesus . The church portion of the complex dates from 1655. It was repaired several times then consecrated once again in 1731. Nuns from this institution founded other Concepcionista convents in Oaxaca, San Miguel Allende, and others in Mexico City. The convent operated until 1863, when the Reform Laws closed it down, with the convent building becoming became state property and the church becoming a parish. The government sold it in 1863 to Florencio Velasco del Castillo for 8,000 pesos. However, this transaction was canceled 43 years later by the judiciary. In 1908, the Secretary of the Government (Secretaria de Gobernaci√≥n) installed a public clock in the building. By 1929, parts of the convent area were being used to raise domestic fowl and pigs with a large quantity of debris in one of the courtyards. It was used as a barracks shortly thereafter and in 1931, was declared an ‚ÄúArtistic Monument.‚Äù In 1982, the complex was declared a Historical Monument of the Nation. Former convent portion Starting in the mid 20th century, the deterioration of the church building has been a serious problem. In 1945, a water leak ruined a painting of Saint Christopher. This water seeping prompted remodeling work in 1966, which included of water sealants. However, the building continues to deteriorate, mostly due to humidity in the roof and walls. This causes the crumbling masonry and danger to those paintings directly applied to the building. Recently the arches near the choir area were replaced completely due to the severe damage from time and elements. In 2006, the outer walls facing Regina Street were scraped and painted but not those facing Bolivar Street. More work needs to be done but the city has offered limited funds and the parish has not been able to raise the remainder to seal the walls from further water damage. The church has suffered robberies of its paintings, mostly during the Reform War and the Cristero War, with a number on the altarpieces now being copies. Other robberies of art objects, money and other items have been much more recent. The ‚ÄúFenix Novohispano‚Äù National Theater Company performed a work based on the legends associated with the church and its convent called ‚ÄúHistorias de vivos, muertos y aparecidos‚Äù (Story of the living, dead and appearances). It consists of four works based on different legends, such as \\"Panes maravillosos\\" (Marvelous breads), \\"Delito con su castigo\\" (Crime with its punishment) y \\"De la tentaci√≥n\\" (Of Temptation), The first tells of a nun of the order who could cure the sick with her bread. The second refers to the story of Don Felizardo Pe√±alva, who robbed a head of Christ made of gold and was found dead in the church, appearing to have been hanged. The last centers on a friar who is attracted to a voluptuous woman. Regina Street was revitalized by the city by making it pedestrian only, with all services such as electricity and water provided underground. Stone and brick paving was installed as well as benches, lighting and trees. This work has prompted the revitalization of many of the private buildings on the street as well. Description Main nave The complex was built with masonry, tezontle and other stone. The church portion remains open to worship and visitors, but the former convent area is mostly closed to visitors. Much of the building is dedicated to the Concepci√≥n Beistegui Hospital, a senior citizen‚Äôs facility. The complex also has a rental hall, a conference hall and a garden with a tile fountain that dates to 1930, as well as 26 gold sconces and many valuable paintings and sculptures. One of the courtyards is called the Patio de la Estampa, which was originally covered. It only conserves one of its arches and parts of others. In 2008, the Sor Juana Salon was inaugurated, dedicated to the Mexican nun from the 17th century . The plaza is located in front of the former convent and church. The plaza contains green areas, benches and a pedestrian corridor. On the opposite side from the church are homes and local businesses. The facade of the church is simple and has been recently painted. It is marked by a slender bell tower and an octagonal dome. A set of tiles at the foot of the bell tower laid in 1773 marks the 200th anniversary of the convent‚Äôs founding. The exterior of the dome is divided into clearly marked segments that are decorated with tiles and pinnacles. Inside, the nave runs east-west and is covered by a barrel vault. The cupola area is painted with images of Church founders Augustine, Jerome, Gregory and Ambrose. On the west end of the nave is the main altar. Due to its flared form, the main altar area can be described as a niche containing other niches. The main altar is made of wood which has been gilded in pure Churrigueresque style. The figures on the main altar include Anthony of Padua and the Four Evangelists. The smaller interior niches contain images of saints Dominic and Francis of Assisi, who is also depicted on one of the medallions. In the center, there is a canvas showing the birth of the Virgin Mary, and above this, there is a sculpture of Saint Joseph. The main altar is framed by slender inverted truncated pyramid (estipite) pilasters. One particularly important niche is gilded, decorated with mirrors, tortoise shell and mother- of-pearl. It contains a sculpture of the Immaculate Conception dating from the 19th century. Far above the altar, there is a depiction of God the Father holding the world in his hands. Main altar In addition to the main altar, several original side altarpieces remain. Two of the side altars, located side-by-side are dedicated to the Calvary and to the Sacred Heart and decorated with eight Salomonic columns adorned with leaves and racemes. These columns flank paintings and two niches. One of these niches contains a well carved depiction of Calvary set against a polychromatic background. The altarpiece of the Virgin of the Fountain was done by Felipe de Ure√±a, who was instrumental in the application of the Baroque style to Mexican churches, especially those along the silver routes north of Mexico City. He was commissioned to create this work in 1738 soon after the church had been expanded and remodeled by Miguel Custodio Dur√†n. The altarpiece is an example of early Baroque or Mexican Churrigueresque style, using estipite (inverted truncated pyramid) pilasters and decorative niches. The latter feature often leads scholars to give the piece a later date. The pose of the Virgin in the painting is static and folkloric and contrasts with the ornate geometry and animated statues of archangels. It is attributed to Jos√© de Ibarra . Other features of the interior of the main nave are interior pediments with black and gold mouldings and are decorated with paintings which are possibly done by Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez . The church also contains nine life-sized sculptures in wood, as well as other altars in Neoclassical and Plateresque styles. Over the main door is an enormous canvas of Saint Christopher and opposite this, next to the altarpiece dedicated to Francis of Assisi, is a doorway leading to the Medina Picazo Chapel, the work of architect Miguel Custodio Dur√°n, which dates from 1733. This chapel began as the cell, or living quarters, of the daughter of colonial doctor Pedro L√≥pez after she took her vows to become a nun. After her death, her brother had the cell restored and transformed into the current chapel. The entrance of this chapel is made of sculpted sandstone and was once golden, looking like an altarpiece flanked by somewhat flame, flame-shaped Salomonic columns. The undulations of the columns are repeated in the pinnacles above, which are topped by a crest bearing images of the sun and moon. The sun represents Christ and the moon represents the Virgin, who reflects the light of her son. The central section of the entrance is dedicated to a sculpture of the Immaculate Conception, above which there is a dove representing the Holy Spirit and a cross. The doors have a wooden grate that has been elaborately carved with Franciscan coats of arms and other decorative items. Inside the chapel, there are oils here done by Villalobos. These include the Visitaci√≥n de Mar√≠a, Los Esponsales de Jos√© y Mar√≠a, La Adoraci√≥n de los Pastores, Anunciaci√≥n and La Adoraci√≥n de los Reyes. To the right of the presbytery, there is a realistic sculpture of the chapel's benefactor, Father Buenaventura de Medina Picazo. The upper choir area has a rectangular iron railing and also has the appearance of an altarpiece. Acanthus leaves are used to form the fretwork containing a series of medallions bearing the anagrams of the \\"Five Persons\\": Jesus, Mary, Joseph and Mary's parents Joaqu√≠n and Ana. The railing is surrounded by moulding that appears to thread through the fretwork. Originally this work was red and gold but the red has turned gray over time. Inside the choir, there are eight paintings by Pueblan artist Francisco Antonio Vallejo.

The tubes are often used to carry out a series of calibration solutions of increasing concentrations, which functions as a comparative scale. To minimize differences in the subjective impression of the color of the solution of the substance to be analyzed, cylinders of a series should have the same characteristics - height, diameter and thickness of glass. Basically there are four types of used cylinders: * high with a capacity of 50 ml (about 300 mm in height, approximately 21 mm in diameter) * low with a capacity of 50 ml (about 175 mm in height, approximately 25 mm in diameter) * high with a capacity of 100 ml (about 375 mm in height, approximately 24 mm in diameter) * low capacity of 100 ml (about 210 mm in height, approximately 34 mm in diameter) These parameters (except volume), however, can vary significantly between two cylinders. Hehnera cylinders differ in that they are scaled to full height.

Early life and education The second youngest of six siblings, Mary Sherman was born to Michael and Dorothy Sherman on their farm in Ray, North Dakota. In 1939, she graduated as her high school's valedictorian.Alumni Records: 1936-1940, Ray High School, Nesson 2 School District, Williams County, ND She then enrolled at North Dakota's Minot State University as a chemistry major.  Career  During Morgan's college education the Second World War broke out. As a result of men going overseas, the United States soon developed a shortage of chemists and other scientists. A local employment recruiter heard that Sherman had chemistry knowledge, and offered her a job at a factory in Sandusky, Ohio. He would not tell her what product the factory made, or what her job would be‚Äîonly that she would be required to obtain a 'top secret' security clearance. Short on money, she decided to take the job even though it would mean having to postpone her degree. The job turned out to be at the Plum Brook Ordnance Works munitions factory, charged with the responsibility of manufacturing explosives trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), and pentolite. The site produced more than one billion pounds of ordnance throughout World War II. Mary Sherman became pregnant in 1943 out of wedlock, a difficult dilemma in an era when this was considered extremely shameful and women were often given back-alley abortions or hidden from their friends and family. At that time she was living with her first cousin in Huron, Ohio. In 1944, she gave birth to a daughter, Mary G. Sherman, whom she later gave up for adoption to that cousin, Mary Hibbard and her husband, Irving. The child was renamed Ruth Esther. After spending the war years designing explosives for the military, she applied for a job at North American Aviation, and was employed in their Rocketdyne Division, Division, based in Canoga Park, California. Soon after being hired, she was promoted to Theoretical Performance Specialist, a job that required her to mathematically calculate the expected performance of new rocket propellants. Out of 900 engineers, she was the only woman, and one of only a few without a college degree. While working at North American Aviation, she met her future husband, George Richard Morgan, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Caltech. Together they had four children‚ÄîGeorge, Stephen, Monica and Karen.  Space race era  During the development program for the Jupiter missile, Wernher von Braun's team used modified Redstone missiles, dubbed the Jupiter C, to accelerate the rocket to orbital velocities. In order to improve the performance of the first stage, they awarded a contract to North American Aviation's Rocketdyne Division to come up with a more powerful fuel. Morgan worked in the group of Dr. Jacob Silverman at North American Aviation's Rocketdyne Division. Due to her expertise and experience with new rocket propellants, Morgan was named the technical lead on the contract. Morgan's work resulted in a new propellant, Hydyne. The first Hydyne-powered Redstone R&D; flight took place on 29 November 1956,History of the Redstone Missile System, p. 60 and Hydyne subsequently powered three Jupiter C nose cone test flights.History of the Redstone Missile System, p. 166 In 1957, the Soviet Union and the United States had set a goal of placing satellites into Earth orbit as part of a worldwide scientific celebration known as the International Geophysical Year.Dickson, Paul: ‚ÄúSputnik, The Shock of the Century‚Äù. Walker & Company. 2001 In this endeavor the United States effort was called Project Vanguard. The Soviet Union successfully launched the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957, an event followed soon after by a very public and disastrous explosion of a Vanguard rocket. Political pressure forced U.S. politicians to allow a former German rocket scientist, Wernher von Braun, to prepare his Jupiter C rocket for an orbital flight. In the renamed launcher (now called Juno I) the propellant succeeded in launching America's first satellite, Explorer I, into orbit on January 31, 1958. After the Jupiter C and six Juno I launches, the U.S. switched to more powerful fuels. = Alternative fuel name = As Hydyne-LOX (liquid oxygen) was the fuel combination used for the Redstone rocket, Morgan whimsically suggested naming her new fuel formulation Bagel, since the rocket's propellant combination would then be called Bagel and LOX. Her suggested name for the new fuel was not accepted, and Hydyne was chosen instead by the U.S. Army. The standard Redstone was fueled with a 75% ethyl alcohol solution, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used Hydyne fuel, a blend of 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA).The Mercury-Redstone Project, p. 2-2. This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, but it was also more toxic.The Mercury-Redstone Project, p. 3-2, 4-42. The fuel was used with the Rocketdyne Redstone rocket only once‚Äîto launch America's first satellite Explorer I, after which it was discontinued in favor of higher performing fuels.  Death and tribute  Morgan died of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emphysema on August 4, 2004 at 82 years old, despite having quit her heavy smoking habit, for lent, 29 years earlier. In July 2013, BBC's online News Magazine released a short video tribute to Morgan, narrated by her son George Morgan. Mary Sherman Morgan was the subject of a semi-biographical stage play written by her son, George Morgan. The play, Rocket Girl, was produced by Theater Arts at California Institute of Technology (TACIT), directed by Brian Brophy, and ran at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California on November 17, 2008. George Morgan admitted that he knew surprisingly little about his mother's life and work when she died, as she worked in an industry connected to defense and national security and was limited in what she could discuss. The younger Morgan had built and launched homemade rockets with friends in the Arizona desert and as he recalled, \\"If I'd known how much expertise in rocketry my mother had, we could have asked her for help and saved ourselves a great deal of trouble.\\" Her penchant for keeping secrets was such that George Morgan did not even know she was ill with emphysema until the last few months of her life, nor was he aware of his half-sister until 2007.

Marcy Raymond (1839‚Äì1913) was an American composer of operetta, songs and piano music. She was born in 1839 in Hartford, Connecticut (some sources say March 6 and others the 16th, 1856, in New York, but this would appear to be erroneous), the oldest daughter of Dr. Erastus Egerton Marcy (1815‚Äì1900) and Emeline Babcock Kilbourn Marcy (1818-1904), whose father was Henry Kilbourn of Hartford. Her father was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and later a homeopathic specialist, who apparently lived for many years on Fifth Avenue on the site opposite Tiffany's. In 1850 he published a book called The Homeopathic Theory and Practice of Medicine. Her sister Nina Marcy (1854-1910), married a lawyer called Ernest G. Stedman. Her uncle was General Randolph D. Marcy, an 1832 graduate of West Point, and her obituary in The New York Times (8 November 1913) says she was a cousin to Mrs George B. McClennan, presumably Ellen Mary Marcy (1836‚Äì1915), the wife of General George Brinton McClellan (1826‚Äì1885), the father of the New York mayor of the same name (1865‚Äì1940). She married 26 October 1860 Captain Edward A. Raymond (born in New York 1835, died around 1880; she had no children with him). She later lived in an apartment in the Ansonia, 2109 Broadway between West 73rd and West 74th Streets in New York. She was buried in the Green Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York. Life as a composer She studied piano with Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829‚Äì1869) and singing with Giorgio Ronconi (1810‚Äì1890), and soon became known for her musical talent being credited as being one of the first American women to compose an operetta: in 1889 she composed the successful Doretta. Her obituary in The New York Times reported that she produced another in Chicago called The Sheik. Her songs and piano pieces were published in France and Germany as well as in the United States. Amongst her songs were 'O Salutaris', 'Bird of Love', 'First Love', and an Ave Maria. She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera House and numbered many singers and prima donnas amongst her friends. During the winter of 1896‚Äì1897, she commissioned the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947) to paint a portrait of the bass-baritone Pol Plan√ßon for her, which was subsequently exhibited in March 1897 at the Durand-Ruel Galleries in New York. It is now untraced. After her death on 7 November 1913 she left a bequest of $300,000 to a homeopathic hospital, her family apparently later challenging the probate on her estate in the courts.

Most homes were pre-fab (some by National Homes) and originally cost between $10,000-$15,000. Cardinal Valley Elementary School on Mandalay Road was completed in time for the 1962 school year. The school originally had 2 wings with grades 1 through 3 housed in the east wing, and grades 4 through 6 in the west wing. A one and two-story addition at the end of the west wing was completed in 1967 to accommodate the school's new library and expanding fifth and sixth grade classes. Cardinal Valley Park was the predecessor to Valley Park and was located in the front parking lot of Cardinal Valley School during the summer months. After several years, Valley Park was erected in the north-east section of the neighborhood, accessed from Deauville Dr. In recent decades, Cardinal Valley has become the hub of Hispanic immigrant culture in Lexington.

However, Hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the Maryland savings and loan crisis. He lost popularity with voters, opening the door for Mikulski's bid for the Senate. Chavez won the primary handily, defeating several Republican challengers. Later, she made comments that some Mikulski supporters interpreted as an attempt to draw attention to the issue of Mikulski's sexual orientation. In an article quoting Chavez's claim that Mikulski was a \\"San Francisco-style, George McGovern, liberal Democrat\\", The Washington Post reported that Chavez was directly implying that the never-married Mikulski was a lesbian. Chavez was accused of making Mikulski's sexual orientation a central issue of the political campaign. In defending her use of the phrase, Chavez stated the line \\"San Francisco Democrats\\" was a reference to Jeane Kirkpatrick's 1984 Republican National Convention \\"Blame America First\\" speech, in which Kirkpatrick coined the phrase \\"San Francisco Liberal.\\". The phrase \\"San Francisco liberal\\" was common at the time. Mikulski never directly responded to the issue and eventually won the race with 61 percent of the vote.

Atlanta ran aground while attempting to break the Union blockade, and after a short battle surrendered to the Union forces. Captain Rodgers became a national hero, and he was promoted to commodore and received the Thanks of Congress as a result of his decisive victory. Background On 10 June 1863, Rear Admiral Du Pont had received reports was about to descend the Wilmington River for a foray into Wassaw Sound and ordered monitors and and gunboat USS Cimmerone to enter Wassaw Sound to stop the Confederate ironclad ram's attack, should she make one, and to prevent her escape. Captain John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the Union force. Five days later, in the early evening of 15 June, Atlanta got underway and passed over the lower obstructions in the Wilmington River to get into position for a strike at the Union forces in Wassaw Sound. Webb dropped anchor at 8:00 p.m. and spent the remainder of the night coaling. The next evening \\". . . about dark . . .,\\" Webb later reported, he \\". . . proceeded down the river to a point of land which would place me in 6 or 7 miles of the monitors, at the same time concealing the ship from their view, ready to move on them at early dawn the next morning.\\"Luraghi, A History of the Confederate Navy, 215 Battle Atlanta, accompanied by wooden steamers and , got underway before daylight on 17 June. A percussion torpedo was fitted to a long spar projecting forward from the ram's bow which Webb intended to detonate against Weehawken. During battle maneuvers Atlanta suddenly ran aground and swayed at an angle which made it difficult to shoot. Weehawken held fire until she was at and then pounded the immobile ship. Nahant had \\"drawn the fire\\" of Atlanta allowing Weehawken to draw within firing distance. After receiving five of Weehawkens shots, which knocked a hole in her casemate, crushed the pilot house and port shutter and severely wounded its pilots and several helmsmen, Webb was compelled to surrender immediately. The battle lasted only a few minutes, and Atlanta became the first Confederate ironclad to surrender to the Union. Meanwhile, the two boats escorting Atlanta sailed upriver for safety. Aftermath Atlanta suffered the sole fatality of the battle, as well as 16 wounded. At the time of capture, 21 officers and 124 men, including marines were taken captive. Atlanta was condemned by a prize court in September 1863, repaired and commissioned as on 2 February 1864. Captain Rodgers became a national hero, and received the Thanks of Congress along with a promotion to commodore. Nahant was involved in the action but withheld fire, which later led to a Supreme Court case which determined the commander and crew of Nahant deserved participation in the prize for the captured vessel.

During that period he was a member of the Association of Heliographers, and exhibited at the gallery on Madison Avenue. Biography Lockwood was born on May 4, 1932, in New York City and became interested in photography as a child. He earned an undergraduate degree in 1954 from Boston University with a major in comparative literature and later attended Columbia University. He served in the United States Army during the 1950s, where he was stationed in Germany. After leaving military service, he traveled widely around the world, with his photographs being distributed by the Black Star photo agency.Fox, Margalit. \\"Lee Lockwood Dies at 78; Captured Life Under Communism\\", The New York Times, August 7, 2010.

Interview with Castro During a trip to Cuba in 1965, Lockwood was able to arrange a lengthy interview with leader Fidel Castro, during which they discussed topics ranging from the Cuban Missile Crisis to racial issues in the United States. Lockwood's book, Castro‚Äôs Cuba, Cuba's Fidel: An American Journalist's Inside Look at Today's Cuba in Text and Picture, published by Macmillan Publishers, was intended to give American readers a clearer picture of the Cuban leader, saying, \\"If he is really our enemy, as dangerous to us as we are told he is, then we ought to know as much about him as possible\\". Visit to North Vietnam Having obtained a visa while in Cuba, Lockwood arranged a trip to North Vietnam in 1967, making him the first Western journalist to visit the country in nearly a decade. He traveled around the country during his month-long visit, covering 1,000 miles under the strict supervision of government minders who ensured that he didn't photograph any of the nation's military facilities. While there, the North Vietnamese presented a confession read by Lt. Cmdr. Richard A. Stratton, a United States Navy pilot who had been shot down months earlier. Stratton, who was described by Lockwood as \\"looking like a puppet\\" whose \\"eyes were empty\\", read a prepared text in which he attacked U.S. military action in the region. The photos that Lockwood took on the trip became the material for \\"North Vietnam Under Siege\\", an article that appeared in the April 7, 1967, edition of Life magazine, including a widely distributed picture of Stratton in prison garb bowing deeply as ordered by a North Vietnamese officer, as well as an array of pictures of the countryside and the effects of American bombing missions.Lockwood, Lee \\"North Vietnam Under Siege\\", Life (magazine), April 7, 1967.

It is on the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence between Quebec Route 138 and the Pointe de la Rivi√®re. The Riverin River flows through the town. The larger Pentec√¥te River enters the Saint Lawrence just south of the village. This name is attributed to Jacques Cartier, who arrived in the area on the Christian holy day of Pentecost in 1535. Pentec√¥te is French for Pentecost. There is a reference to the river in a document by Louis Jolliet from 1685 in which he refers to a river named \\"Pannecoste\\". The Pentec√¥te weather station is operated by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, and Fight Against Climate Change (MDDELCC). It reports that the average annual temperature is and the average annual rainfall is .

In 1884, the Penticost River Post Office opened, renamed to the French form Rivi√®re-Pentec√¥te in 1933. At the end of the 19th century, it was among the most important industrial centres along the North Shore. The first newspaper in the region, L'√âcho du Labrador, was published in 1903 in Rivi√®re-Pentec√¥te by Eudist father Joseph Laiz√©. In 1972 the Municipality of Rivi√®re-Pentec√¥te was formed out of unorganized territory. On 19 February 2003 the Municipality of Rivi√®re-Pentec√¥te was amalgamated into the Town of Port-Cartier.

History In 1918, the Texas Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (TFCWC) began to petition the state of Texas to create a \\"state-sponsored home for delinquent girls\\" and the club would donate the land. A member of the club, Carrie Adams, was very vocal in the need to create a training school for \\"delinquent black girls.\\" In 1920, the land was purchased by TFCWC. In 1927 the Texas Legislature authorized the establishment youth correctional facility for black girls by the Texas State Board of Control. However, despite the approval, no money was appropriated for the school until 1945. In 1945 the legislature provided funds to build the state school which was first called the Brady State School for Negro Girls. In August 1946 the State Board of Control entered into a lease agreement with the Federal Government of the United States so the State of Texas could use a former prisoner of war camp in McCulloch County, near Brady. In February 1947 the Brady State School for Negro Girls opened; until the opening of Brady, there were no correctional facilities that admitted black girls. In 1949 the State Youth Development Council took control of the Brady facility. In 1950 the State of Texas moved the black girls' state school to a former farm in Houston County, near Crockett, establishing the Colored Girls Training School at Crockett. The state moved the girls so the state could cut costs and so the girls could be closer to an African-American population. In 1957 the state school was placed under the control of the Texas Youth Council (now the Texas Youth Commission). The state school was integrated in 1966, and so its name changed to Crockett State School for Girls. The juvenile facility closed in 1972. The facility, renamed to the Crockett State Home on December 13, 1973, was then used as a house and educational center for dependent and neglected children. In 1975 the youth home operations stopped, and the Crockett State School re-opened as a juvenile correctional facility for boys. In 1979 the Gatesville State School closed, and Crockett took some students previously at Gatesville.\\"Gatesville State School for Boys.\\" Handbook of Texas. Retrieved on July 23, 2010.

He played in the Canadian Football League in 1965 for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and in 1966 for the Montreal Beavers of the Continental Football League. Early years Anthony attended Roger Bacon High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He played on offense at the fullback position and on defense as a linebacker for Roger Bacon's football team. In December 1960, he was selected by the UPI as a first-team All-Ohio defensive player at linebacker. University of Michigan In 1961, Anthony enrolled at the University of Michigan. He played at the fullback position for Bump Elliott's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1962 to 1964. He was Michigan's lead rusher in 1963 and 1964. In two games against Iowa in 1963 and 1964, Anthony scored six touchdowns (three each in 1963 and 1964) and rushed for 204 yards (83 in 1963 and 121 yards in 1964). He also rushed for 84 yards on 15 carries (5.6 yards per carry) against the 1963 Ohio State Buckeyes football team. As a senior, Anthony was one of the leaders of the 1964 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the Big Ten Conference championship and defeated Oregon State in the 1965 Rose Bowl. The 1965 Rose Bowl was Anthony's final game for Michigan, and Anthony was named the game's Most Valuable Player after he rushed for a career-high 123 yards, scored three touchdowns, and averaged 9.5 yards per carry. He also set a Rose Bowl Game record with an 84-yard touchdown run, surpassing the prior record set by Iowa's Bob Jeter in the 1959 Rose Bowl.

This conservation category is one of nine IUCN threat assessment categories for species to indicate their risk of global extinction. The categories range from 'extinct' (EX) at one end of the spectrum, to ‚Äòleast concern‚Äô (LC) at the other. The categories ‚Äòdata deficient‚Äô and 'not evaluated' (NE) are not in the spectrum, because they indicate species that have not been reviewed enough to assign to a category. The category of 'not evaluated' does not indicate that a species is not at risk from extinction, but simply that the species has not yet been studied for any risk to be quantified and published. The IUCN advises that species categorised as 'not evaluated' \\"...should not be treated as if they were non-threatened. It may be appropriate . . . to give them the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed.\\". By 2015 the IUCN had assessed and allocated conservation statuses to over 76,000 species worldwide. From these it had categorised some 24,000 species as globally threatened at one conservation level or another. However, despite estimates varying widely as to the number of species existing on Earth (ranging from 3 million up to 30 million), this means the IUCN's 'not evaluated' (NE) category is by far the largest of all nine extinction risk categories.  Other applications  The global IUCN assessment and categorisation process has subsequently been applied at country and sometimes at regional levels as the basis for assessing conservation threats and for establishing individual Red Data lists for those areas. Assessment criteria have also begun to be applied as a way of categorising threats to ecosystems, with every ecosystem falling into the IUCN category 'not evaluated' prior to the start of the assessment process.

This family includes the medically important genus Latrodectus‚Äîthe widow spiders. The species in the genus Rugathodes are too small to be dangerous to humans. Very little is known about most species in this genus. Description Pink phase female carrying eggcase, parasitic wasp larva on abdomen Total length (of body, excluding legs) is 1.5-2.5 mm. Typically, the cephalothorax is pale yellow-brown with a dark/blackish median band, usually extending the full length of the carapace, widest at the posterior eye row, surrounding the eyes. The cephalothorax margins are dusky. The abdomen is pale yellow-brown with a variable pattern of three pairs of black and white spots, giving the species its name (from the Latin sex meaning \\"six\\" and punctum meaning \\"spot\\"). There is often a broken white band bordering the rows of spots. The sides of the abdomen are dusky and the ventral surface is pale. There is considerable variation within the species, with east coast specimens tending to have distinct spots, while west coast specimens can have a totally black abdominal dorsum. Alaska specimens tend to be intermediate in coloration, but are variable, with overall coloration from the typical pale yellow-brown to dark brown or greenish-gray, and occasionally pinkish areas on the dorsum between the spots. Darker individuals can be very difficult to differentiate from the closely related Rugathodes aurantius. female epigynum Female distinguishing characteristics: The paired openings of the epigynum (epigyne) are nearly merged into a single oval opening, with a variable median divider extending in from the anterior side, giving the impression of a rounded ‚ÄòB‚Äô lying on its back. male chelicera Male distinguishing characteristics: The chelicerae (fangs) are enlarged with a very distinctive shape, as shown in the photograph. Distribution This species is widespread across the United States, southern Canada and Russia. In North America, it has been reported from the far Aleutians (Kanaga Island) to Newfoundland, south to central California, northern Arizona and North Carolina. It is usually found in coniferous forests, both in the trees and in the understory vegetation. They have been observed overwintering in leaf litter. It is considered a boreal species that is found at higher elevations in the southern parts of its range. Life History R. sexpunctatus has roughly an annual life cycle. Both males and females usually overwinter in the pentultimate (1 molt prior to adult) stage. They mature and breed in late spring, with the males probably dying soon after mating since they are rarely collected past early summer. Adult females have been collected through early fall. Egg sacs have been observed through September, with later egg sacs containing fewer eggs/spiderlings. It is not known whether the later egg sacs are repeat layings by the same female. Females have been observed moving their egg sac around their web, carrying it under their abdomens, especially when disturbed. Spiderlings molt once in the egg sac prior to emerging as second instars. The fifth instar is the adult stage. References * 2003. Guide d'identification des Araign√©es (Araneae) du Qu√©bec.

It was censored at the time of creation and was published after Oesterheld's death. Editorial story The Argentine comic book authors H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld and Alberto Breccia started in 1968 a number of comic books devoted to the biographies of important people of Latin American history. The first issue was Vida del Che (), and it was about Che Guevara. When it was finished and published, they started working in one for Eva Per√≥n. However, when Che's comic book was published, it was removed from distribution and all copies of it were destroyed. Facing such situation, Oesterheld stopped the whole project. Although Oesterheld had finished the script and Breccia the drawings, the production was not finished.\\"Apenas Che apareci√≥ a la venta, Oesterheld comenz√≥ a trabajar en el argumento de Evita y consecuentemente Breccia empez√≥ con los dibujos. En medio de esto, Che fue retirado de la venta y los originales destruidos. Esta persecuci√≥n oblig√≥ al editor a considerar abortado el proyecto y los autores, consecuentemente, lo abandonaron\\" Doeyo, \\"Palabras del editor\\" Two years later, Breccia received a new offer to draw a comic book about Eva Per√≥n. It had a politically neutral script, whereas the one by Oesterheld had a radical peronist style. The art was the same than in the unpublished comic book, but being coloured, whereas the original was meant to be a black and white comic book.\\"Entre 1969 y 1970 se edit√≥ con otro guionista y dibujo de Breccia, en una versi√≥n despolitizada, inconseguible hoy por hoy\\". Martignone, p. 6 Oesterheld was disappeared in 1978 and Breccia died in 1993. In 2002, the editor Javier Doeyo found the original script written by Oesterheld at the house of Breccia's widow, while searching for material for another project.\\"en mayo de 2001 [...] me encontraba hurgando entre las carpetas de Breccia en casa de su viuda Irma, en busca del gui√≥n faltante de un cap√≠tulo de Buscavidas que estaba sin letrear. Para mi sorpresa [...] encuentro el argumento original de Oesterheld con el que Breccia empez√≥ a trabajar y que por la cancelaci√≥n del proyecto dej√≥ de lado\\" Doeyo, \\"Palabras del editor\\" With this script, he could restore the original unpublished comic book. The art was already published as described, and the colours were removed to restore the originally intended black & white by using image editing software. The script received minor corrections, fixing outdated information.\\"...actualizadas ciertas partes hist√≥ricas (se recuper√≥ el cad√°ver de Eva tras su abominable hurto [...]), la biograf√≠a es arrolladora y panfletaria, pero cuenta la historia de nuestro pa√≠s\\". Martignone, p. 6 For instance, the fate of Evita's corpse was still unknown in 1968, whereas by 2002 it had been recovered and placed at La Recoleta cemetery. The work was thus published in 2002 by Doedytores. In 2007 it was edited again by Clar√≠n, along with work about Che, as part of a series of reprints of noteworthy comic books. Description The comic book describes the life of Eva Per√≥n in a biographical manner, from birth to death. It has a strong peronist point of view, and is highly critical of the military and other political forces. It does not employ the common techniques of the genre, and hasn't any speech balloons or sequential art. The drawings are used merely to illustrate the events being described by the text. Alberto Breccia would explain that \\"My work is testimonial, it can't be otherwise, because it includes characters like Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...\\".\\"Mi trabajo es testimonial, no podr√≠a ser de otra manera porque aparec√≠an personajes como Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...\\" (Breccia) Doeyo, \\"Palabras del editor\\". Some pictures are made from famous photos or iconography of the time. For example, the first image (used by Doeyo to design the comic book cover) is based upon the cover of Evita's autobiography, La Raz√≥n de mi Vida.

The second is 'Ghost in the Machine' (published in 2009), the third is The Crossbones (published in 2010), the fourth is The Raven (published in 2011), and the fifth is The Phantom Room (published in 2014). Synopsis The story takes place in a small town called Skeleton Creek, that was formerly a gold and silver mining town. It is haunted by the ghost of \\"Old Joe Bush\\", a man who died in an accident on The Dredge, a large mining machine. Two youths in the town, Ryan McCray and Sarah Fincher, attempt to investigate the dredge and its ghost, while being closely watched by their parents and Ranger Bonner who are trying to keep the two separated after Ryan breaks his leg on the Dredge which leads to Sarah and Ryan not being able to communicate with each other at all. A video series, starring Sarah, also goes along with the novel, which shows trips to the Dredge and ghost sightings such as Old Joe Bush Pre-release Prior to the release of Skeleton Creek, a conspiracy website (SkeletonCreekIsReal.com) was created, questioning whether the videos and journal entries were actual events. The basis of the website is that the creator found a hidden directory on Patrick Carman's website. On the directory were files of videos. The creator uses these videos to determine that the events in Skeleton Creek happened in the real town of Sumpter, Oregon. The site has a blog where the creator talks about findings, and videos where he posts things such as the videos he finds on Patrick Carman's website, analysis of those videos, a trip to the Dredge and promotion for The Raven, the fourth book in the series. As of August 13, 2011, no blog entries have been made, and the last video was posted November 1, 2010. Even though it is considered abandoned, updates to the site are made, such as new advertisements for Patrick Carman's other projects. Patrick Carman has admitted to creating the website to promote the book and its sequels. One of these websites is called Sarahfincher.com. It accompanies the book. It is filled with videos that may be spooky for young children. To watch a video you must have reached a point in the book that has a password. Many of the password contains gibberish making the passwords hard to guess. The videos are made, looking like they are only made for Ryan, and many people enjoy playing along.

With the benefit of his local connections he oversaw a great expansion of the abbey's properties through grants and purchases, and also rationalised its holdings to create a robust base for an early medieval monastic community. Early abbacy (770‚Äì72) According to the Libellus constructionis Farfensis, a late ninth- century source, Probatus was \\"born in the Sabine province\\" and \\"fully educated from childhood in the chant of the holy Roman Church\\", that is, the Old Roman chant.Costambeys 2007, 154n: Savinensi natus provincia and maxime vero sancte Romanae Aecclesiae cantu a pueritia plene imbutus. This may suggest a connexion with the Roman diocese, but it need not suggest that he learned the chant in Rome. He was a deacon of Farfa in 769, when Abbot Alan died and was replaced by his chosen successor, Guicpert. The latter's abbacy was opposed by the monks, who petitioned King Desiderius to intervene. The king expelled the interloper and confirmed the abbey's right to elect its abbots. In late February or early March 770 the community chose one of their own: Probatus.Costambeys 2007, 152‚Äì58. Probatus' familiarity with local politics made him a superior choice compared with the foreigners who had served as Farfa's abbots prior. He immediately attracted royal patronage: by 772 the abbey had received three curtes (some type of house) and one monasteria (a church with a monastic community) that had previously belonged to Queen Ansa, a gift to her from her son, Adelchis. Probatus also succeeded in attracting private donors (that is, not the Dukes of Spoleto). During his tenure Farfa secured thirty donations, more than three-quarters of which were gifts outright. He also received from private citizens one confirmatio (confirmation of a prior acquisition) and one promissio (promise of a future donation in land), and increased Farfa's lands by purchasing private property on one occasion and exchanging it on four others to rationalise the abbey's holdings. In 772 Desiderius, who had up to that point been acting as Duke of Spoleto, bestowed that office on Theodicius, who proceeded to make a grant to Farfa.For a complete list of ducal grants to Farfa, see Costambeys 2007, 75. Farfa and the fall of the Lombard kingdom (773‚Äì74) Map of the Papal States indicating the Duchy of Spoleto and the Sabina. Probatus may also have been the beneficiary of a famine that struck Italy in 774‚Äì75,Reported in a letter of Pope Hadrian. and caused an increase in the charitable donations. Likewise the threat of war may have influenced Duke Hildeprand of Spoleto to procure divine favour or vouchsafe his land to God by donating it to the abbey. The charters of three grants the duke made to Farfa credit the monks with suggesting them, a sign of Probatus' gift for diplomacy. In 773, before April, Desiderius was pressuring Rome with his army when Pope Hadrian I sent a delegation led by Probatus and twenty of his senior monks to deal with the king.Costambeys 2007, 282. The biographer of Hadrian in the Liber pontificalis says that the pope \\"summoned\\" (accersiri faciens) the abbot, but the implications of hierarchy in this word are probably false. At this time all of Farfa's charter's were dated by the reign of the king. The purpose of this expedition was to procure the return of some cities which had been captured from the Duchy of Rome (which lay outside Desiderius' kingdom); it was the purpose of another papal delegation later that year to receive the cities, which, however, Desiderius did not agree to return. Probatus' embassy can be viewed as an effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to preserve the political order and its peace (\\"to save Desiderius from himself [since] many in the duchy [of Spoleto] did not share the Lombard king's confidence in his own military strength\\"). In 774 Italy fell to Charlemagne, king of the Franks, after a successful siege of the capital, Pavia, and Desiderius was taken into captivity. Securing immunity and independence (775‚Äì78) Probatus was the first Italian abbot to get confirmation of his abbey's holdings and of its spiritual immunity (from secular and prelatical authority) from the Frankish king. In order to obtain these privileges it was necessary for Probatus to travel to the Frankish court at Quierzy in 775.Costambeys 2007, 323. There, in his royal villa, Charlemagne issued his first privilege for Farfa on 22 May, exempting it from episcopal jurisdiction and confirming its freedom of abbatial election. A second privilege was issued on 29 May granting it spiritual immunities.The wording of the first privilege is: ut nullus episcoporum pro electione abbatis dationem accipere debeat et potestatem non habeat de ipso monasterio auferre cruces, calices, patenas, codices vel reliquas quaslibet res de ministerio ecclesiae nec ipsum monasterium sub tributo ponere principum potestatem minime haberet nec denuo tributum aut censum in supradicto monasterio eorum exigere debeat. Probatus returned to Farfa in January 776 and a flood of donations to the abbey, now patronised by the most powerful ruler in western Europe, followed. The years 776‚Äì78 were the most fruitful in the early development of Farfa's territory.For an outline of the largesse of this period, see Costambeys 2007, 302‚Äì06. In those years Farfa received seven grants from Duke Hildeprand, who had been confirmed in his position by Charlemagne. The confirmation of spiritual immunity was important at the time, since Farfa was dealing with its first recorded jurisdictional dispute with the Papacy. According to the Libellus constructionis Farfensis, Pope Hadrian had ordered that disputes between Farfa and some men from Rome be settled by his prior vestiarius, Miccio.Peter Llewellyn, Rome in the Dark Ages (London: 1971), 112, reads the document, which survives only as quoted in the Regestum Farfense and Chronicon Farfense of Gregory of Catino (early twelfth century), as implying Miccio's \\"charge of the affairs of the abbey of Farfa\\", but Thomas F. X. Noble, The Republic of Saint Peter: The Birth of the Papal State, 680‚Äì825 (Philadelphia: 1984), 158, followed by Costambeys 2007, 154n, reads no such thing. This was a secular official pertaining to the secular offices the Papacy had acquired in the Duchy of Rome. The pope's letter to Probatus of 22 April 772, referring to the abbot's allegations of \\"many evils\\" (plura mala) committed against Farfa by some Romans, admits that the infractors hailed from \\"our Roman republic\\" (nostra Romanorum reipublica, lit. ‚Äúrepublic of the Romans‚Äù) and is dated by the joint reign of the Byzantine emperors Constantine V and Leo IV.Costambeys 2007, 297‚Äì98, views the letter as evidence an effort to shore up the pope's secular lordship and assert Roman independence vis-√†-vis the Lombard kingdom. Noble 1984, 133, considers the letter insignificant. In 777‚Äì78 Probatus was able to construct a three-kilometre aqueduct for the abbey by convincing landowners to make pro anima gifts (for the sake of the soul) of the requisite land.

While working on its follow-up, the group disbanded in May 2004. History After disbanding Mineral in 1997, frontman Chris Simpson and bassist Jeremy Gomez formed a new band. Guitarist Brian Hubbard and drummer Matt Hammon were brought into the fold sometime after. Hammon and Simpson were in a bar when the former asked \\"[W]hen are we going to get some songs together and do the Gloria record?\\" Instead of simply going with Gloria, Simpson opted for the Gloria Record as he felt it was a better name and less likely to confuse them with a Latin- American singer of the same name. A friend of the band's was in contact with Crank! A Record Company founder Jeff Matlow, who asked him if any new artists needed a label. When he got the band's 7\\" single, he called and offered to work with them. The self-titled EP was released on Crank! in November 1998. It was met with favorable reviews; the release was viewed as a continuation of Mineral, and drew comparisons to Sunny Day Real Estate and Radiohead. Later that year, Ben Houtman joined the group on piano/organ. Various US tours followed, and in 1999, Brian Malone replaced Hammon on drums.

The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each bilingual law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions do not say exactly the same thing. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which states, , \\"The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [i.e. both English and French].\\"Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3, s. 133 (U.K.). History The rule requires courts to treat \\"both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law.\\"This definition of the equal authenticity rule is from Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, The Law of Bilingual Interpretation. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 17. The rule holds that both versions are equally authoritative even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible. An early version of the principle may be found a statute of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, enacted in 1857. The Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure requires that the Civil Code of Lower Canada be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: \\"[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side.\\" It has been suggested that this provision of the 1857 Act is \\"best understood as a non- verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically.\\"Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, The Law of Bilingual Interpretation. Toronto: LexisNexis, 2008, p. vi. Whether or not this is an overstatement, it is certainly true that side-by- side publication was the first step towards the eventual adoption of the equal authenticity rule for interpreting bilingual statutes. The equal authenticity rule was developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1891, in the court‚Äôs ruling in CPR v. Robinson. This case dealt with the Civil Code of Quebec, which is enacted in both French and English. By implication, the rule also related to all laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada, as section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 is equally binding upon the federal Parliament and Quebec legislation. The Supreme Court of Canada first applied this rule of judicial interpretation to Acts of Parliament in 1935, in its ruling in the case of R. v. DuBois. The rule was reaffirmed as subsection 18(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11, sub¬ß18(1). when the constitution was patriated in 1982. Unresolved issue regarding the application of the rule Some Canadian provinces (Quebec and Manitoba from the time of their establishment, and since 1982 New Brunswick) are constitutionally obligated to enact all laws in both official languages. However, a number of other provinces, such as Ontario, have opted to enact their laws in both English and French, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. One question, not yet tested in the courts, \\"arises...as to whether both versions of bilingual legislation enacted in a province where there is no constitutional requirement to do so would be considered equally authoritative in the absence of an express Equal Authenticity Rule.\\"Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, The Law of Bilingual Interpretation. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 27. (An \\"express\\" equal authenticity rule would presumably take the form of such a rule in the relevant province's Interpretation Act or some other piece of quasi- constitutional legislation.) Bastarache et al., who raise this question, answer it in the affirmative, explaining that in their view, \\"the logic applicable to federal, Quebec and Manitoba legislation under the Constitution would also apply [even in the absence of a legislated statement of this logic]: that is, where two languages [sic] versions of a statute are enacted simultaneously both versions will be considered equally authoritative.\\" References Category:Canadian law Category:Bilingualism in Canada Category:Supreme Court of Canada Category:Legal doctrines and principles ","title":"Equal authenticity rule"},{"id":"28303048","text":"Gans is an unincorporated community in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States.

He served as a lieutenant commander during the Vietnam War from 1966 to 1973. He was attached to the USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14)/Air Wing 19/Attack Squadron VA-192 flying 22 combat missions earning two Air Medals and the Combat Action Ribbon. After capture by the North Vietnamese on January 5, 1967, he served with the Fourth Allied POW Wing, Hanoi, DRVN. He earned the Silver Star for his valor and leadership while a prisoner of war. His post service career was as a clinical social worker licensed to practice in Rhode Island and Florida and a national certified addiction counselor, Level I. He served as the chairman of the Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War from 1989 to 1995. Early life and education Stratton was born on October 14, 1931, in Quincy, Massachusetts. His father was Charles Arthur Stratton (1902‚Äì1975) of South Boston, Massachusetts, a veteran of WW I (U.S. Navy) and WW II (Massachusetts State Guard). His mother was Mary Loretta (Hoar) Stratton (1903‚Äì1989) of Somerville, Massachusetts. His brother was Charles A. Stratton Jr. (1930‚Äì1988), a Veteran of the Korean War Era (U.S. Marine Corps). Stratton attended the Quincy, Massachusetts public schools (1937‚Äì1948) and Our Lady of Hope Minor Seminary (1949‚Äì1951), Newburg, New York. He joined the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1951, completing his novitiate in Ipswich, Massachusetts, in (1952). He studied philosophy at the Oblate College, Washington, D.C. (1952‚Äì1954). Leaving the seminary he graduated from Georgetown University (1955) with AB degree in History/Government. He earned a Master of Arts degree (International Relations) from Stanford University (1964) and a Master of Social Work degree from the Rhode Island College School of Social Work (1988). He developed an early interest in aviation with initial visits in the mid-1930s to Dennison's Airport (Squantum), Quincy, Massachusetts, the home of the Harvard Aero Club and host to such luminaries as Amelia Earhart. During his high school years this interest was further developed as he closely observed the intensive training activities of aircraft based at the Naval Air Station Squantum, (Quincy Massachusetts) during WW II, observed aircraft carrier launchings at the Fore River Shipyard (Quincy, Massachusetts) and maintained contact with neighbors then serving in the Armed Forces. Military career =Pre-Vietnam= During high school Stratton enlisted in the Massachusetts National Guard (1947‚Äì1948) [211 Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (Mechanized) ‚Äì First Corps Cadets]. He served as mortar squad leader and was discharged as a private first class to enter the minor seminary. Upon graduation from college (1955) he enlisted in the Navy as a naval aviation cadet commencing the U.S. Naval School of Preflight with class 19-55. He was commissioned ensign, USNR-R upon completing Preflight. He received his flight training with CNABATRA in the Pensacola Naval complex, making his initial carrier qualification on the in the North American SNJ-5 on July 27, 1956. He commenced his advanced flight training with CNAVANTRA, Corpus Christi, Texas, flying out of Naval Air Station Chase Field, Beeville, Texas, in TV-2, F9F-2 and F9F-8 aircraft. Upon receiving his wings in 1957, he received a regular commission and was retained in ATU-203 as an instructor. In 1958 he received orders to Attack Squadron Ninety-Four (VA-94) home ported at NAS Alameda, California. Flying the FJ-4 (Fury) and then the A4D Skyhawk he made two deployments to the Far East on board the attached to Carrier Air Group Nine. His squadron callsign was \\"Cyrano\\". From 1962 to 1964 he was assigned to the NROTC Unit Stanford for postgraduate studies in International Relations under Professor James T. Watkins IV. He accomplished his proficiency flying at NAS Moffett Field, Sunnyvale, California, flying TV-2 and SNB aircraft. =Vietnam War (1964-1975)= Pre-deployment In 1964 Stratton was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and assigned as Aide and Executive Assistant to the Deputy Director, Joint Strategic Planning Staff, SAC, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. He maintained his aviation qualifications flying USAF T-33 aircraft out of Offutt. Upon completion of that tour of duty in 1966 he was ordered to VA-125, the light attack replacement air group, NAS Lemoore, California, for refresher training in the A4 Skyhawk. That summer he joined Attack Squadron One Ninety Two (VA-192) as Maintenance Officer and light attack aviator. In October 1966, His callsign was \\"The Beak\\". VA-192 joined Carrier Air Wing Nineteen on board the for a deployment to the Gulf of Tonkin and South China Sea. He left his family in Hanford, California, on October 11, 1966. During the squadron's first forty days on the line in combat, he accumulated 21 combat missions. Prisoner of war and \\"The Stratton Incident\\" Stratton was flying an A-4 Skyhawk on January 5, 1967, as part of an armed reconnaissance mission over Thanh H√≥a Province to bomb the My Trach ferry. When the ferry could not be found, Stratton spotted a set of barges one mile further upriver and rolled in to attack the craft with rockets. Stratton was forced to eject from his plane when debris was ingested into the engine. According to Stratton he was shot down when the missile he fired from his wing dropped away as it was designed however failed to ignite its engine until it was behind him. Then when the missile engine started the heat seeker locked onto his exhaust trail and he shot himself down. When telling this story he chuckled about adding this to his record of number of aircraft shot down. He was captured shortly after parachuting to the ground. Despite the fact that North Vietnam had marched captive POWs through the streets of Hanoi surrounded by a jeering abusive population, the State Department did not feel that it had enough proof to accuse the North Vietnamese of abusing the prisoners. There was enough evidence however to convince aviators that they would be subjected to \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". Having obtained a visa while in Cuba, American photojournalist Lee Lockwood arranged a trip to North Vietnam in 1967, making him the first Western journalist to visit the country in nearly a decade. While there, the North Vietnamese presented a confession read by Stratton, attacking U.S. military action in the region. Lockwood described Stratton as \\"looking like a puppet\\" whose \\"eyes were empty\\". The photos that Lockwood took on the trip became the material for \\"North Vietnam Under Siege\\", an article that appeared in the April 7, 1967, edition of Life magazine, which included a widely distributed picture of Stratton in prison garb bowing deeply as ordered by a North Vietnamese officer. Robert J. McCloskey of the U.S. Department of State cited Lockwood's material about Stratton as evidence that North Vietnam was brainwashing prisoners for propaganda purposes. In the Department of Defense history of the Vietnam POW situation, \\"The Long Road Home\\", the author, Vernon Davis, in a section labeled \\"The Stratton Incident\\" recounts the worldwide revulsion engendered by the incident and the eventual decision of the USG to go public with POW mistreatment. A 1978 book by Scott Blakely, _Prisoner at War: The Survival of Commander Richard A Stratton,_ , explores the bowing incident and its complicated history. Stratton was not brainwashed or drugged. The tape recorded \\"statement\\" was the product of torture. Stratton used the Lockwood press conference to perform in such a way that it would raise doubt and confusion regarding the so-called confession to the discredit of his captors. His nom de guerre while attached to the 4th Allied POW Wing in Hanoi changed frequently to confuse his captors: \\"Dick\\"; \\"Penis\\", \\"Wiz\\" (Wizard). He served under the direction of Cdr. James Bond Stockdale (MOH), the Senior Officer Present - Navy. A full account of Stratton's prison experience is contained in Scott Blakey's biography. \\"Prisoner at War\\" and his oral history, U.S. Naval Institute. Operation Homecoming Stratton was released on March 4, 1973, at Hanoi's Gia Lam Airport as part of the 2nd DRV Increment, Operation Homecoming, consisting of 108 POWs on three flights. He had been a prisoner for 2,251 days. While a prisoner, he had been promoted to the rank of commander. After being processed at the Clark Air Base Hospital, the Philippines, he arrived back in the United States on March 8, 1973. He was awarded the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit with V, the Bronze Star Medal with V, the Navy Commendation Medal with V, the Purple Heart and the Prisoner of War Medal for service as a prisoner of war. Completing convalescent leave, he refreshed in the A4 at NAS Lemoore, California, and then reported for duty as Executive Officer, Naval Plant Representative Office, (Strategic Systems Project Office), Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Sunnyvale, California. He was selected for captain during this assignment. =Post Vietnam War= Stratton was assigned as Commanding Officer, Navy Recruiting District New York, East Meadow LI, New York, in 1975. From 1977 to 1979 he was Commander, Recruiting Area Five, Great Lakes NTS, North Chicago, Illinois. From 1979 to 1981 he was Deputy for Operations, U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. His final active duty assignment was as Director, Naval Academy Preparatory School, NETC, Newport, Rhode Island, from 1981 to 1986. Post retirement ‚Äì second career Upon his retirement in 1986 Stratton matriculated at the Rhode Island School of Social Work in pursuit of a career as a clinical social worker. He graduated in 1988, became licensed to practice in Rhode Island and specialized in children and families, addictions and PTSD. He qualified as a member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers and a national certified addiction counselor, Level I. Moving to Florida in 1993, he became licensed to practice in Florida and worked as a contract counselor retiring in 2001 after four years counseling sailors and their families at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia, and Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

Answers, Answerbag, WikiAnswers and Twitter as well as building systems for supporting such activities. Highly related topics involve traditional and virtual reference services, information retrieval, information extraction, and knowledge representation. Background Social information seeking is often materialized in online question-answering (QA) websites, which are driven by a community. Such QA sites have emerged in the past few years as an enormous market, so to speak, for the fulfillment of information needs. Estimates of the volume of questions answered are difficult to come by, but it is likely that the number of questions answered on social/community QA (cQA) sites far exceeds the number of questions answered by library reference services,Janes, J. (2003). The Global Census of Digital Reference. In 5th Annual VRD Conference. San Antonio, TX. which until recently were one of the few institutional sources for such question answering. cQA sites make their content ‚Äì questions and associated answers submitted on the site ‚Äì available on the open web, and indexable by search engines, thus enabling web users to find answers provided for previously asked questions in response to new queries. The popularity of such sites have been increasing dramatically for the past several years. Major sites that provide a general platform for questions of all types include Yahoo! Answers, Answerbag and Quora. While other sites that focus on particular fields; for example, StackOverflow (computing). StackOverflow has 3.45 million questions, 1.3 million users and over 6.86 million answers since July 2008 while Quora has 437 thousand questions, 264 thousand users and 979 thousand answers.Wang, G., Gill, K., Mohanlal, M., Zheng, H., & Zhao, B.

Research Agenda for Social Q&A.; Library and Information Science Research, 11(4), 205-209. consists of three components: a mechanism for users to submit questions in natural language, a venue for users to submit answers to questions, and a community built around this exchange. Viewed in that light, online communities have performed a question answering function perhaps since the advent of Usenet and Bulletin Board Systems, so in one sense cQA is nothing new. Websites dedicated to cQA, however, have emerged on the web only within the past few years: the first cQA site was the Korean Naver Knowledge iN, launched in 2002, while the first English-language CQA site was Answerbag, launched in April 2003. Despite this short history, however, cQA has already attracted a great deal of attention from researchers investigating information seeking behaviors,Kim, S., Oh, J-S., & Oh, S. (2007).

Research questions Some of the interesting and important research questions in this area include: * What causes people to be involved in social Q&A;? * What is the motivation of people who participate in social Q&A;? * Why do questioners choose social Q&A; as a source to find information? * Why do they ask questions online to people whose background or expertise may be unverified? * Why do they choose social Q&A; over other sources to look for information? * What do they expect from answers given by anonymous people on the Web? * Why are the answerers willing to share information and knowledge with anonymous people, for free? * Why do they spend time and effort to find information and help others online? Why are they willing to expose their personal stories to people and inform others with their experiences? Shah et al.Shah, C., Oh, S., & Oh, J. S. (2009).

(2017). Social Information Seeking: Leveraging the Wisdom of the Crowd. The Information Retrieval (IR) series. Berlin, Germany: Springer. . (187 pages) presents a more recent and comprehensive information pertaining to SIS.  Friendsourcing in social Q&A;  Friendsourcing is an important component of social question and answering, including how to route questions to friends or others who will most likely answer the question.Liu, Z., and Jansen, B. J. (2015) Analysis of Question and Answering Behavior in Question Routing Services. 21st International Conference on Collaboration and Technology (CRIWG 2015). Yerevan, Armenia. 22 ‚Äì 25 Sept., p.72-85 The important questions include what people's behaviors are in social networks, especially what kinds of questions people ask from their social networks and how different question types affect the frequency, speed and quality of answers they receive. Morris et al. (2010) conducted a survey of question and answering within social networks with 624 people, and gathered detailed data about the behavior of Q&A;, including frequency, types of questions and answers, and motivations. They found that half (50.6%) of respondents reported having used their status messages to ask a question, which indicated that Q&A; on social networks is popular. Also, the types of questions people asked include recommendation, opinion, factual knowledge, rhetorical, etc. And motivations for asking include trust, asking subjective questions, etc. Their analysis also explored the relationships between answer speed and quality, questions‚Äô property and participants‚Äô property. Only a very small portion (6.5%) of the questions were answered, but the 89.3% of the respondents were satisfied with the response time they experienced even though there's a discrepancy between that and expectation. Also, the responses gathered via social networks appear to be very valuable. Their findings implied design for search tools that could combine the speed and breadth of traditional search engines with the trustworthiness, personalization, and the high engagement of social media Q&A.; Paul et al. (2011)Paul, S. A., Hong, L., & Chi, E. H. (2011, May). Is Twitter a Good Place for Asking Questions? A Characterization Study. In ICWSM. did a study on question and answering on Twitter, and found that out of the 1152 questions they examined, the most popular question types asked on Twitter were rhetorical (42%) and factual (16%). Surprisingly, along with entertainment (29%) and technology (29%) questions, people asked personal and health-related questions (11%). Only 18.7% questions received response, while a handful of questions received a high number of responses. The larger the askers‚Äô network, the more responses she received; however, posting more tweets or posting more frequently did not increase chances of receiving a response. Most often the ‚Äúfollow‚Äù relationship between asker and answerer was one-way. Paul et al. also examined what factors of the askers would increase the chance of getting a response and found that more relevant responses are received when there is a mutual relationship between askers and answerers. Intuitively, we would expect this, as mutual relationship would indicate stronger tie strength and hence, more number of relevant answers.  Social Q&A; services  Existing social Q&A; services can be characterized from the three perspectives, by the definition of social Q&A; as a service involving (1) a method for presenting information needs, (2) a place for responding to information need, and (3) participation as a community. = Presenting information needs = These social networks support various friendsourcing behavior, provide information benefits that oftentimes traditional search tools cannot, and also may reinforce social bonds through the process. However, there are many questions and limitations that may prevent people from asking questions on their social networks. For example, they may feel uncomfortable asking questions that are too private, might not want to cost too much other people's time and effort, or might feel the burden of social debts. Rzeszotarski and Morris (2014) took a novel approach to explore the perceived social costs of friendsourcing on Twitter via monetary choices. They modeled friendsourcing costs across users, and compared it with crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Their findings suggested interesting design considerations for minimizing social cost by building a hybrid system combining friendsourcing and crowdsourcing with microtask markets. = Responding to information needs = Sometimes, only asking question from people's own social networks or friends is not enough. If the question is obscure or time sensitive, no members of their social networks may know the answer. For example, this person's friends might not have expertise in providing evaluations for a specific model of digital camera. Also asking the current wait time for security at the local airport might not be possible if none of this person's friends are currently at the airport. Nichols and Kang (2012) leveraged Twitter for question and answering with targeted strangers by taking advantage of its public accessibility. In their approach, they mined the public status updates posted on Twitter to find strangers with potentially useful information, and send questions to these strangers to collect responses. As a feasibility study, they collected information regarding response rate, and response time. 42% of users responded to questions from strangers, and 44% of the responses arrived within 30 minutes. = Participation as a community = Another important and unique component of social Q&A; system is that it is a community which allows members to form relationships and bonds, so that their behavior in these social Q&A; services will also add to their social capital. Gray et al. (2013) explored how bridging social capital, question type and relational closeness influence the perceived usefulness and satisfaction of information obtained through questions asked on Facebook. Their results indicated that bridging social capital could positively predict the perceived utility of the acquired information, meaning that information exchanges on social networks is an effective way of social capital conversion. Also, useful answers are more likely to be received from weak ties than strong ties.  Authority detection in social media  In order to recommend the most appropriate users to provide answers in a social network, we need to find approaches to detect users' authority in a social network. In the field of information retrieval, there has been a trend of research investigating ways to detect users' authority effectively and accurately in a social network. Cha et al.Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., & Gummadi, P. K. (2010). Measuring User Influence in Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy. ICWSM, 10(10-17), 30. investigate possible metrics for determining authority users on popular social network Twitter. They propose the following three simple network-based metrics and discuss their usefulness in determining a user's influence. # indegree (followers count) # retweet count # mention count An initial analysis of the three aforementioned metrics showed that the users with the highest indegrees and the users with the highest retweet/mention counts were not the same. The top 1% of users by indegree are shown to have very low correlation with the same percentile of users by retweets and by mentions. This implies that follower count is not useful in determining whether a user's tweets get retweeted or whether the other users engage with them. Pal et al.Pal, A., & Counts, S. (2011, February). Identifying topical authorities in microblogs. In Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining (pp. 45-54). ACM. designed features to measure a user's authority on a certain topic. For example, retweet impact refers to how many times a certain user has been retweeted on a certain topic. The impact is dampened by a factor measuring how many times the user had been retweeted by a unique author to avoid the cases when a user has fans who retweet regardless of the content. They first used a clustering approach to find the target cluster which has the highest average score across all features, and used a ranking algorithm to find the most authoritative users within the cluster. With these authority detection methods, social Q&A; could be more effective in providing accurate answers to askers.

Architecture The Cultural Center of Mayag√ºez is a two-story building with a facade that is dominated by arches, built at a cost of one million dollars under the management of Baudilio Vega Berr√≠os, for whom the building was named. It was built strictly with municipal funds. It has a theater with capacity for seven hundred people, a library, a history museum, reading and conference rooms as well as a modern cafeteria. History The Centro Cultural San Baudilio Vega Berr√≠os is located in place that for many years occupied the town fire station. The Cultural Center began as an organization founded in 1958 under the presidency of Amador Ram√≠rez Silva as part of a project of the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture. With the cooperation and donations of different institutions and people from Mayaguez, the Center starts to become a reality with a series of activities. Since then the Municipal Administration has become an important column in the organization. With the city's bicentennial approaching in 1960, the Bicentennial Committee proposed the construction of a building that would house the different facets of Mayag√ºez cultural life. In 1968, the Cultural Center was finally inaugurated. Don Baudilio Vega Berr√≠os, Mayor of the city, said during its inauguration, that: \\"... in fact, at all classes social-working, artisans, dependents on commerce, businessmen, industrialists, it was notable the concern towards the joy in their cultural recreational field as so many jobs in their daily lives\\". Therefore, the building was constructed for the Cultural Center of the city of Mayag√ºez aiming to replace the old municipal theater using modern construction techniques. On September 3, 1983 being mayor of the city Benjamin Cole, the Cultural Center was dedicated in honor of Baudilio Vega. Currently, the Cultural Center of Mayag√ºez houses a public library, cultural theater and tourist office as well as the Municipal Bomba School.

Evaporating dishes are used to evaporate excess solvents ‚Äì most commonly water ‚Äì to produce a concentrated solution or a solid precipitate of the dissolved substance. Most are made of porcelain or borosilicate glass. Shallow glass evaporating dishes are commonly termed \\"watch glasses\\", since they resemble the front window of a pocket watch. Some used for high- temperature work are of refractory metals, usually of platinum, owing to its non-reactive behaviour and low risk of contamination. The capacity of evaporators is usually small ‚Äì in the range 3‚Äì10 ml. Larger dishes, up to 100 ml, are different in shape, and are more hemispherical. The evaporator is used most often in quantitative analysis. In the determination of silicon content in an organic sample, a small and accurately-measured quantity of a substance is added to the large amount of sulfuric acid, then heated in an evaporating dish. The dish is heated with a Bunsen burner, until only stable precipitate remains, which contains the silica content. The dish is then closed and heated at high temperature until completely clean, fused silica is produced. Comparison of the initial weight of the substance and that of the fused silica allows the content of silicon in the sample to be determined. A generic evaporator dish The shape of the evaporating dish encourages evaporation in two ways: * The shell is relatively flat. A relatively large liquid surface promotes evaporation. * If heated in a flask or beaker, a part of the evaporated liquid condenses on the vessel walls and flows back into the solution. This does not happen in a dish. When heating liquid in an evaporating dish, the low walls encourage splashes and so stirring or swirling of evaporating liquids is considered bad practice, owing to the risk of spillage. Evaporation, especially in production quantities rather than merely for analysis, is now mostly performed in a rotary evaporator. This is preferred because it works much faster and may be used under vacuum, avoiding unwanted reactions with the atmosphere and allowing control of noxious fumes. Evaporation under vacuum also reduces the severity of bumping and violent ebullition.

The ride was built and designed by IntaRide (a subsidiary of Intamin) and opened to the public on June 26, 2010. Based on a western theme, Shoot the Rapids featured two drops with the second one crossing under the first. In February 2016, reports surfaced that the ride would be permanently dismantled. On February 20, 2016, Cedar Point officially announced the ride's permanent closure. History A log flume named Shoot-the-Rapids debuted at Cedar Point in 1967. The ride closed in 1981 to make room for White Water Landing. Following weeks of dropping hints on Facebook about an upcoming new thrill ride for 2010, Cedar Point Vice President John Hildebrandt announced on September 3, 2009, that the new ride would be a log flume called Shoot the Rapids, reusing the name of the previously defunct log flume. Details confirmed that the ride would be designed and built by Intaride LLC, the North American subsidiary of Intamin, on the Millennium Island location of the park (now called Adventure Island). Shoot the Rapids opened to the public on June 26, 2010, and was Cedar Point's most expensive water ride ever built. On February 11, 2016, less than six years later, it was reported in the Sandusky Register that construction crews began removing elements of the ride's structure leading them to believe the ride was being removed from the park. Initially, Cedar Point officials did not publicly comment on the matter.http://www.sanduskyregister.com/Business/2016/02/11/Shoot-The-Rapids- coming-down.html?ci=stream&lp;=2&p;=1 Then on February 20, 2016, during the park's annual \\"Winter Chill Out\\" off-season tour, Cedar Point confirmed the reports stating that Shoot the Rapids would not reopen in 2016 and would be removed from the park. In its spot is Professor Delbert's Frontier Fling, formerly RipCord, which had been moved to the former log flume's location due to the expansion of the waterpark area, Cedar Point Shores. Professor Delbert's Frontier Fling is named after Professor Delbert Feinstein, a character appearing on the Paddlewheel Excursions ride, which was removed when the Dinosaurs Alive walk-through attraction was added. The ride The ride was based on taking a journey through a rustic western environment and took riders through an illegal moonshine business. Guests boarded flat bottom, 10-passenger fiberglass boats that advanced through the attraction along a canal of water. Special effects included rock canyons, geysers, water features, and a dark tunnel. Riders had to be 48 inches tall, or 46 inches tall to ride with an adult. Shoot the Rapids had two lift hills. The first hill had an drop, at 85 feet tall, which made the ride as tall as the Corkscrew roller coaster. The second hill was tall and crossed under the first. The drops were about 45 degrees. Depending on where one sat, a rider could get slightly wet or totally drenched. Incidents On July 19, 2013, a boat carrying seven passengers rolled backwards down the first lift hill and flipped over, injuring all seven riders on board; one was taken to a local hospital and later released. The ride remained closed for the rest of the season.

The theater's inaugural performance was of Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user on 17 December 1904. Busoni's Doktor Faust was performed in 1925. The building was significantly damaged from an aerial bombing on 1 March 1943, but remained in operation until 1 September 1944 when the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of the Nazi government closed all German theatres. A second bombing on 6 October 1944 completely destroyed the original building. St√§dtische B√ºhnen Dortmund An interim theatre was inaugurated by Theater Dortmund on 12 September 1950, with a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fidelio. The intendant was P. Walter Jacob, who pursued performances of Wagner's operas and more recent works. He staged and conducted Wagner's Lohengrin during his first season and conducted Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg the following year. He staged Hans Pfitzner's opera Das Herz (1930) and the drama Eli of Nelly Sachs (1950). In 1954 the musical comedy Die stumme Serenade of Erich Wolfgang Korngold was premiered. In 1955 Jacob staged Franz Werfel's drama Jacobowski und der Oberst and played a leading part himself. The theater was mainly used for operas; plays were mostly performed at the Theater am Ostwall. Theater Dortmund was called St√§dtische B√ºhnen Dortmund (Stages of the City of Dortmund). Oper Dortmund Opernhaus Dortmund The new opera house Opernhaus Dortmund opened in 1966 to serve as a venue for operas, ballets, concerts, and for plays which require a big stage. The first performance was Der Rosenkavalier of Strauss, an opera which had been performed first in 1911, the year of the works premiere. Wilhelm Sch√ºchter conducted the Dortmunder Philharmoniker. In 1967 he conducted the premiere of the opera Eli of Walter Steffens after the drama of Nelly Sachs, a commission of the city of Dortmund. The orchestra used the opera house for concerts until 2002, when the Konzerthaus Dortmund was opened. Schauspiel Dortmund Since 1968 the post-war opera house serves as the main stage for plays. Theater Dortmund also operates smaller theaters for more experimental productions. Schauspiel Dortmund and collective Tools for Action won an award for Cultural Education of the Federal Ministry of Culture and the Media of Germany for 2017 for the project Mirror Barricade. Konzerthaus Dortmund Since 2002 the orchestra has been using the newly opened concert hall Konzerthaus Dortmund as a venue for the orchestra's concerts and guest performances.

To manage the operations of the SEQ Water Grid and maintain water security, it made daily decisions about water demand; and based on those projections supplies treated water to the SEQ Water Grid to meet the needs of communities and businesses. The SEQ Water Grid Manager was also responsible for ensuring safe, secure and efficient water is delivered to SEQ Water Grid customers; managing the SEQ Water Grid's debt profile; implementing a whole-of-Grid risk management framework; and implementing whole-of-Grid improvement projects. Seqwater assumed the function of the SEQ Water Grid Manager on 1 January 2013.

Tolkien, centered in the Lord of the Rings novels. The massive-scale simulation takes part in the realm of Rohan and the player controls the forces of Good during the onslaught of the forces of Evil, namely centered on the conflict with Saruman of Isengard. It was published by Konami and Mirrorsoft. Gameplay In terms of gameplay, it is very similar to the 1988 War in Middle Earth, except the setting was downsized from the entire world just to the land of the Rohirrim, engulfing mostly the storyline from The Two Towers, and to a small extent ending in The Return of the King. In a combination of a single-unit adventure, small-scale battlefield tactics and broadscale campaign warfare, the player must coordinate the Fellowship and Rohan's troops in order to fend of the invasion of Saruman's Orcs and save the Rohirrim lands, as well as mounting enough forces to push the war on the fronts in the east in order to contribute to Sauron's defeat. At the beginning, the player can in the starting menu choose to start a new game, load an old one, quit, access encyclopedias dealing with featured units and characters, or practice. The practice folds down to tutorials in single-fighter combat: \\\\- Archery: the player takes control of Legolas attempting to shoot down (18) Orcs from a wall, while crouching from their spears \\\\- Duel: the player chooses between four Heroes: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and √âomer, to fight either an Orc or a Dunlending in melee combat \\\\- Magic Duel: the player takes control over Gandalf fighting a Nazg√ªl flying mounted on a Felbeast The game begins just before the Battles at the Fords of Isen, with the player taking control over Rohan's western armies (an army consisted of an infantry unit [Westfold Militia], a light cavalry unit [Outriders], a horse archers unit [Harrowdale Bow] and three heave cavalry units [Helms Deep Guards and Edoras Guards, the Grimslade squadron being under Th√©odred's personal leadership]). The main army is led by Th√©odred, while there is a separate unit of heavy cavalry [Harrowdale] that is still behind on the road. The game ends when Sauron is destroyed after the Battle at the Black Gates and Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom. =Units= The player can control only the good side in the conflict. * Rohirrim Infantry - the poor, the young and the old gathered together, versatile all-round melee fighters eager to patriotically defend their homeland (squad size: 600) * Rohirrim Archers - Rohan ground units which have mastered the proficiency with the bow (squad size: 150) * Rohirrim Light Cavalry - fastest in the world, ideal scouts; useful for rapid skirmishes (squad size: 450) * Rohirrim Heavy Cavalry - renown horsemen, among the hardest fighters in the world; useful for routing enemies with their lances (squad size: 450) * Rohirrim Horse Archers - highly skilled, mounted ranged units; can also fire while moving but with reduced accuracy (squad size: 150) * Ents - tree-like beings from Fangorn forest as they are, they are fiercely powerful warriors little can stand against, should they ever decide to join the conflict and not neutrally stand by idle. * Orcs - all-around melee units, but generally weak and flee when outnumbered; vulnerable when exposed to direct sunlight * Orcish archers - coward Orc fighters that have mastered the proficiency with the bow * Uruk-hai - elite Saruman's warriors, hybrid orcs; travel across sunlight without problem; fierce fighters that can stand ground against most * War Riders - Orcs mounted on the backs of large wolves (Wargs); very savage and fierce, except when their attack is broken; their mounts are hungry and independent on their own, very weakly trained * Dunlendings - savage, lightly-armed tribesmen from the countryside with an innate hatred for the Rohirrim, will blindly fight to the death  Characters  The game features a number of characters, only conditionally \\"heroes\\": * Aragorn - (Fellowship) the mightiest mortal in the world, a brilliant personal fighter; master strategic leader * Gimli - (Fellowship) masterful hand-to-hand combat fighter * Legolas (Fellowship) - Elven prince; best archer in the world, very quick but lightly armed * Gandalf (Fellowship) - a Wizard (Maia) sent by the Valar to aid the Free Peoples against the Dark Lord, the most powerful hero; avoids combat and councils others, best fighter amongst the Good forces with unmatched powers, invincible through conventional means (can wipe out nearly anything) * Merry (Fellowship) - non-combatant; stealthy * Pippin (Fellowship) - non-combatant; stealthy * Treebeard (Ents) - leader of the Ents, among the oldest creatures; concerned for the living, especially his native Forest * √âomer (Rohan) - King's nephew and Third Marshall of the Riddermark; excellent leader as second only to the King; very good sword fighter * Erkenbrand (Rohan) - Leader of Westfold and commander of Helm's Deep; an exceptional warrior and is bent on maintaining the defenses at the Hornburg * Hama (Rohan) - King's Doorward and Captain of His Guard; a very good fighter as boundlessly loyal * Th√©oden (Rohan) - The King. The best military commander in the world, still a potent fighter, but very old and physically weakened * Th√©odred (Rohan) - Prince, Second Marshal of the Riddermark. Identical to √âomer (personal combat), but a weaker commander * √âowyn (Rohan) - 'Eomer's sister, inspires the people as a shield maiden; non-combatant * Gr√≠ma (Rohan/Isengard) - The King's councilor, convinced Saruman is an ally, in reality a spy and saboteur * Saruman (Isengard) - the chief antagonist; powerful as Gandalf, unengaged leader of the evil forces; wants to anihialate the Rohirrim and get the One Ring for himself, building an Army of dark forces for that task Reception Computer Gaming World called the game's graphics \\"simple, yet pleasing\\", but described it as \\"a lightweight strategy game that includes several action sequences and some very limited character interaction\\". The magazine stated that those who had not read Tolkien's books would likely not understand the game's backstory, and that strategy players would dislike how closely they needed to follow the original story's actions to succeed in the game. Computer Gaming World only recommended it to devoted Tolkien fans.  See also  * War in Middle Earth (1988 computer game) References External links *J. R. R.

The 1961 Convention emphasized the concept of the \\"interests of the child\\" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. It built upon prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties and brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of \\"nationality\\" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of \\"habitual residence.\\" The convention also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the Boll case (regarding the Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors). Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction‚Äîprimarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as illegal.

The Lehigh Coal & Navigation CompanyThe names \\"Lehigh Coal and Navigation\\" and 'Lehigh Coal & Navigation\\" occur in the legal and historical records of both eras. Convention on Wikipedia is LC&N; for company affairs before 1967 and LCAN for the New Company founded in 1988. was a mining and transportation company that operated in Pennsylvania from 1818 (1820 & 1822) to 1964. It ultimately encompassed source industries, transport, and manufacturing, making it the first vertically integrated company in the United States.Archer B. Hulbert, The Paths of Inland Commerce, A Chronicle of Trail, Road, and Waterway, Vol. 21, The Chronicles of America Series. Editor: Allen Johnson (1921) Building on two predecessor companies incorporated in 1818, founders Erskine Hazard and Josiah White entered the coal industry to serve customers seeking a steady supply of fuel for foundries and mills on the falls of the Schuylkill River. Their LC&N; spearheaded the Industrial Revolution in the United States, accelerating regional industrial development by taking on civil engineering challenges thought impossible and creating important transport and mining infrastructure. Most importantly, the LC&N; established the Lower Lehigh Canal (begun 1818, usable 1820, improved 1821‚Äì24, and made two-way in 1827-29) and taught America to burn anthracite. By the early 1830s, the Lehigh Canal and its \\"bridging\\" river trip along the Delaware River inspired and connected four other canals. History The Company's success, along with White's reputation for advancing the state of mining and civil engineering, jumpstarted America's brief Canal Age. It also spurred investing in raw materials industries and bulk transportation infrastructure projects. Further, the dawdling funding efforts behind the Schuylkill Canal project (begun in 1814) was finally funded and finished once the LNC had showed the way. White and Hazard had backed the Schuylkill project since their mills were on the River, but became disgusted with the timid investment and management attitudes of its board, so explored the LCMC property and conducted feasibility examinations the winter of 1814‚Äì1815, so petitioned to build the canal that next year. Upon their return they inked what was effectively a no cost option to take over management of the LCMC mines and mining rights; guaranteeing one ear of corn per year as a rental for the next 20 years.\\"Soon after this failure, Josiah White and Erskine Hazard, who were engaged in the manufacture of wire at the Falls of Schuylkill, having obtained good results in their experiments with the coal they had purchased from Cist, Miner and Robinson, secured control of the entire property of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company under the terms of a lease for twenty years. George F. A. Hanto joined them in the venture and was largely depended upon to secure the necessary financial assistance to make the property productive. Under the conditions of the lease, it was stipulated that, after a given time for preparation, they should deliver for their own benefit at least forty thousand bushels of coal annually in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts, and should pay, if demanded, one ear of corn as a yearly rental.\\", Brenckman, pp. 77-78 built the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad and had its hands in many other northeastern Pennsylvania shortline railroads, spurs, and subsidiaries; created the Ashley Planes and made or supported means to other novel solutions of transport problems; and created transport corridors still important today.It also pioneered the mining of anthracite coal in the United States, acquiring virtually the entire eastern lobe of the Southern Pennsylvania Coal Region, and brought in Welsh experts to bootstrap Iron production using blast furnace technology in the Lehigh Valley, building the first six such furnaces and puddling furnaces to create steel, which the company then provided to its own wire rope (steel cable) manufactury, the countries first it set up in Mauch Chunk. Completing the vertical integration, the wire ropes were then marketed to other mining operations, cable railways, and other industries needing high tensile reliability in managing weighty loads. Buying out partner George Hauto, and forming the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;) in 1822 by combining the Lehigh Coal Mining Company (1893), the Lehigh Coal Company (then, leasing the lCMC's properties) and the Lehigh Navigation Company, it represented the first merger of interlocking companies in the United States. Five years later, the company built the Mauch Chunk and Summit Hill Railroad, the first coal railroad and just the second railroad company in the country to be constructed after the Granite Railroad of Quincy, Massachusetts. It was founded by industrialists Josiah White (1780-1850) and Erskine Hazard (1790-1865), National Canal Museum ‚Äì The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company Accessed 2008-09-18. who sought to improve delivery of coal to markets.http://siris- archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!140147!0&term;=#focus and a thickly accented German immigrant miner named Hauto.Hurlbert, Chapter III, quote: Believing that coal could be obtained more cheaply from Mauch Chunk than from the mines along the Schuylkill, White, Hauto, and Hazard formed a company, entered into negotiation with the owners of the Lehigh mines, and obtained the lease of their properties for a period of twenty years at an annual rental of one ear of corn. The company is known in the Lehigh Valley as the \\"Old Company\\", as distinct from the later 1988-2010 company: the nearly same named Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company-- the 'New Company', to the people of the region.Per paid guide presentation in July 2013 at the Lansford- Coaldale 'Number Nine Museum' in the Panther Creek Valley.

The Panther Creek stream running west below Lansford, Coaldale and summit hill is running downhill to the Little Schuylkill River watershed, at Tamaqua, over the terrain where the Old company built the Panther Creek Railroad from Tamaqua Junction to Lansford and the mines above Nesquehoning. LC&N; later built the Hauto Tunnel, shortening the trip to points east some 12 miles, and avoiding delays from the crowded rail nexus at Delano Junction. In 1792, hunter Philip Ginter discovered coal, updated September 24th, 2009, http://www.summithill.com, LeeMantz@summit-hill.com, (accessed: 9 September 2013) on Sharpe Mountain--a peak on Pisgah Ridge near (today's) Summit Hill close to the border between Schuylkill and Carbon Counties. The Lehigh Coal Mine Company was founded the following year, but management proved weak and tried to operate in an absentee mode, the officers staying behind in comfort while sending expeditions out into the wilderness for trips of over a year under foremen. These troops would have to trek to the mine site, dig the coal, use mules to bring bags of it to the Lehigh, then cut down trees and build crude arks near Lausanne Landing and then, shoot the rapids of the Lehigh hoping to reach the Delaware. The LCMC only sporadically successfully got anthracite to Philadelphia and its rights were eventually absorbed by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company which leased its operational rights in predecessor Lehigh Coal Company. =Lehigh Coal Mine Company= The Lehigh Coal Mine Company (LCMC) was founded in 1792 (incorporated 1793) with enough money to buy in and around the Panther Creek Valley and along Pisgah Ridge, and the aim of hauling anthracite from the large deposits on Pisgah Mountain near what is now Summit Hill, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia via mule train to arks built near Lausanne on the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers. The mining camps were over 9 miles from the Lehigh at Mauch Chunk. Sporadically active between the years of 1792 and 1814, the Lehigh Coal Mine Company was able to sell all of the coal it could get to fuel-hungry markets, but lost many a boatload on the rough waters of the unimproved Lehigh River, so actually just as often lost money as made profits.Brenckman's History of Carbon County, pp. 594: The task which Josiah White and Erskine Hazard undertook, that of making the Lehigh a navigable stream, was one which had before been several times attempted, and as often abandoned as too expensive and difficult to be successfully carried out. The Legislature was early aware of the importance of the navigation of this stream, and in 1771 passed a law for its improvement. Subsequent laws for the same object were enacted in 1791, 1794, 1798, 1810, 1814, and 1816, and a company had been formed under one of them which expended upwards of thirty thousand dollars in clearing out channels, one of which they attempted to make through the ledges of slate about seven miles above Allentown, though they soon relinquished the work. Eventually, the owners sold some coal to Josiah White and Erskine Hazard, who operated a wire mill foundry at the Falls of the Schuylkill near Philadelphia.John P. Miller, 1979. The Lehigh Canal: A Thumb Nail History, 1829-1931. The Author. White and Hazard were delighted by the quality of the fuel, and subsequently bought the LCMC's final two barges to survive the trip down the Lehigh. Convinced they could much improve the reliability of its delivery, they began in 1815 to inquire after the rights to mine the LCMC's coal and hatched a plan to improve the navigation on the Lehigh as a key step.Memoirs of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania; 1864. pp. 330‚Äì. =Lehigh Coal Company= White and Hazard very shortly found themselves advised repeatedly that both the improvements, and the mining operation at Summit Hill, having each repeatedly failed miserably time after time, were both considered crackpot schemes, usually by differing groups of potential investors; the majority opinion being the improvements were more possible, and the coal mining was less likely to be a success. Accordingly, they secured other investors by forming two companies: The Lehigh Coal Company (LCC) and the Lehigh Navigation Company, and began seeking legislative approval for improving the Lehigh River with a navigation. In 1817, they leased the Lehigh Coal Mine company's properties and took over operations, incorporating on Octo ber 21, 1818, as the Lehigh Coal Company along with partner Hauto. They petitioned the legislature and propose acquiring rights to make improvements of the river, for which there was a string of supportive legislation going back decades. In 1820, White and Hazard bought out Hauto and dissolved the LCC on April 21, 1820.Ancestry.com, p593: \\"We will remark here that the Lehigh Coal Company was incorporated by act of Oct. 21, 1818; that its leading characters were the same as those of the Navigation, White, Hazard, and Hauto; that the last named was bought out by his partners in March, 1820, and that on April 21, 1820, the two companies were consolidated under the title of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company.\\" The next hurdle surprised White and Hazard--there were in general, as was witnessed by the legislator's comments, a wide divergence of opinion as to whether the Lehigh could be tamed, and perhaps more surprising, there were less backers of any scheme to continue mining coal from the lands held by LCMC --there were simply too many failures over the 24 years of its operations for the peace of mind of many investors. Accordingly, three times the funds were raised to improve the river as were raised to put the mining & delivery of coal onto a regular paying basis. Given permission, the two companies went to work, and overstocked the market demand in 1820, having opened practical, though not ideal navigability of the Lehigh over four years ahead of their targeted 1824. Coal mining and delivery by grading a near constant descent mule track from Summit Hill to feed a loading chute at the huge slack water pool created at Mauch Chunk, went well as well; the coal deposits were essentially outcrops needing little effort to extract. Riding this success, the two companies were merged into the Lehigh Navigation Company, resolved to apply the high tech of the American Canal Era (canals, locks, rails) to bringing coal to their foundries and the stoves and furnaces of Philadelphia and beyond. =Lehigh Navigation Company = Having displayed great technological skills by creating the world's first iron wire suspension bridge, which spanned the Schuylkill River at their wire works, White and Hazard schemed with other industrialists to secure a reliable source of anthracite. To move the coal to market, they entered political negotiations to acquire rights to tame the turbulent and rapids-ridden Lehigh River for navigation. By 1817-18, they had organized the separate Lehigh Navigation Company and had written stock flyers announcing plans to deliver barge loads of coal regularly to Philadelphia by 1824. The LCMC had trouble delivering Anthracite to Philadelphia at costs cheaper than imported Bituminous Coal from Britain or Virginia. Their last expedition had been sent out in 1813 during the war & blockade caused bituminous shortages, and by the time five arks were sent down river, three sank, leaving the directors of LCMC disgusted and unwilling to fund more losses. The company began to prepare plans and surveyed sites, and when the state legislature approved the river work in 1818, immediately hired teams of men and began to install locks, dams, and weirs, including water management gates of their own novel design.Brenckman, p. 627 A brief history of the navigations beginnings as Brenckman related in 1884: The canal head end needed a location where barges could be built and timber and coal could be brought into slack water. The challenge was to do it above the gap made by the east end of Mount Pisgah, a hard rock knob that towers 900 feet above the Lehigh River towns Jim Thorpe (formerly Mauch Chunk) to the towns west, and Nesquehoning to its north. Both towns are built into the flanks, the traverses, of the mountain, with flats along the river banks. (A few decades later, railroads would follow the canals.) Within the next two years, White and Hazard constructed a descending navigation system that used their unique \\"bear trap\\" or hydrostatic locks, which allowed the passage of coal boats by means of artificial floods. The coal arrived at the head end from the mines at Summit Hill or down along the steep mule trail from near the headwaters of Panther Creek. It floated down the navigation; at journey's end, the barges were sold as fuel or for Delaware basin transports. The navigation company began shipping significant quantities of coal by early 1819, ahead of expectations, and attained their goal of regular shipments in 1820. In 1820, the company was combined with the Lehigh Coal Company with the ouster of George Hauto, but was not rechartered officially until 1822. =Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company= By late 1820, four years ahead of their prospectus's targeted schedule, the unfinished but much improved Lehigh Valley watercourse began reliably transporting large amounts of coal to White's mills and Philadelphia. The nearly 370 tons of coal brought to market that year not only salved the winter's fuel shortage but created a temporary glut. After buying out co-founder George Hauto, White and Hazard reworked their lease deal with the Lehigh Coal Mine Company, and merged it with the Lehigh Coal Company, acquiring ownership of its 10,000 acres spanning three parallel valleys in the from Mauch Chunk to Tamaqua. A few months later, they merged the LCC and the Lehigh Navigation Company. In late 1821, they filed papers to incorporate Lehigh Coal & Lehigh Navigation, which took effect in 1822. Non-mining Ventures The LC&N; Co. under both White and Hazard (1822-1865) as operations managers was a company constantly looking for innovative solutions to increase business and revenues.Brenckman, History of Carbon County, 1913 Ed., unattributed page. The vertical integration many economists credit them with inventing would appeal to them as a very natural way to control costs, hence maximize profitability. The two, and the various members of the corporate board often heard of ideas that separately(?) or together needed financial investment which the LC&N; company would often join as investors, and often end up providing a later critical boost of finishing financing, investing in such ventures directly, or buying out at a later time as subsidiaries as things developed a proof of concept, track record, better promise, or dependency on another business. =Blast Furnaces= =Grand Lehigh Canal- Upper Canal Division= The June 6, 1862 flood proved to show a fatal flaw in White's grand dream. The Upper Grand contributed to its own demise in that the dams and locks necessary to allow the coal barges to travel on the river meant that huge pools of water sat at the ready. Once the heavy June rains began, and dams began to be breached, devastating tidal waves of flood water burst dam after dam causing a great flood and loss of life. John J. Leisenring Jr., then Superintendent of the LCN & Co. estimated that 200 people lost their lives from White Haven down to Lehighton. The state legislature stepped in and prohibited the LCN & Co. from rebuilding. =Railroads= ;Primary reference: Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad In 1827, the Company in one massive well organized effort, completely built the of America's second railroad using the road bed of the wagon road built in 1818‚Äì19 in just a few months ‚Äî a gravity railroad named the Mauch Chunk and Summit Hill Railroad (or similar name variants) using wooden sleepers on a gravel substrate (as did most more modern railways) ‚Äî to bring coal from mines to river more efficiently. The work went quickly since the right-of-way surveyed by White (well before 1818's charter) ran along the virtually uniform gradient created by grading the original mule trail, work overseen by Hazard in 1818. The wagon road to become gravity railroad ran from what later became Summit Hill along the south side of Pisgah Ridge to Mount Pisgah to the canal's loading chute over above the canal banks, Room Run Railroad The Room Run or Rhume Run Railroad was a shortline coal road built by Josiah White from a ravine in the Nesquehoning Valley =Non-railroad Companies= During the winters ending in 1821‚Äì1823, the partners learned a lot about icing damage and canal construction to prevent heavy damages by sustaining them, but also learned some damages would be sustained each winter. The need for an injection of new cash to do such repairs in 1821 lead to the company reorganization into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, which also bought out George Hauto's share and left White and Hazard with majority ownership; having injected most additional funding from their own pockets. In 1823 the upper four locks on the Lehigh Navigation from Lehigh Gap to Mauch Chunk were rebuilt as proof of concept test beds with a spacious bi-directional long lock system. White had offered the legislature to build a ship & steam tug capable two way lock canal system from Mauch Chunk down to Philadelphia along the Lehigh and Delaware in 1823, but was rebuffed in 1824, with the promise the state would build the Delaware Canal. LC&N; had to build coal arks and exhausted thousands of acres of timberlands for the one-time, single use boats, costing the company dearly while the state delayed. * Delaware Division Canal Company - The State of Pennsylvania had embarrassed itself with a botched canal ditch construction some the terminii of the Lehigh Canal from Easton, PA and parallel to the Delaware River to Bristol, PA, a suburb of North Philadelphia. In 1831 after it opened and leaked prodigiously, the commonwealth had to ask Josiah White to step in and repair the new ditch, then, common sense injected, asked the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company to operate the venture when his fixes enabled it to open in 1834. Consequently, LC&N; Co. spawned the Lehigh Navigation Coal Company subsidiary, which operated both canals into the 1930s. In mid-1832 White's men had repaired the most egregiously leaking sections well enough to begin operations, and the LC&N; Co. spun-off the Lehigh Navigation Coal Company the LNC Co., as a subsidiary operating company with its own management. Mill Parks Founders White and Hazard were at first, mill and foundry owners acting decisively to secure fuel for their main businesses prior to 1815's application for right-of-way legislation and optioning the sad-sack LCMC operations. In 1814, the partners had actually invested first in the rival Schuylkill Canal where they'd become disgusted with the planning, funding, and lack of commitment by other board members--their concerns take on added weight given the Schuylkill didn't operate until 1823 when LC&N; had blazed the way. White's innovative Bear Trap lock-gate and system was based on creating a triggerable artificial flood, depending upon water flow to float the boats past the rapids obstructions. It is little wonder that as he surveyed the Lehigh, he also made note where a water powered mill could be harnessed, and the legislative act would effectively give the LNC ownership of the entire river. These rights were not released back to Pennsylvania until 1964. So once 'emergency' improvements on the canal used its founder's knowledge and experience on the Little Schuylkill to develop the waterpower sites along its waterways into early industrial parks. By 1840, the Abbott Street area near Lock 47, now part of Easton's Hugh Moore Park, employed over 1,000 men in almost a dozen factories. This fostered the industries of Allentown, Bethlehem, and their products and the connection with the Delaware Canal (managed for the state by LC&N; after 1834) allowed the LC&N; to stop leasing rights to the CNJ and transfer them instead to the new acquisition. =Decline= In 1932, the Lehigh Navigation was closed after maintenance expenses surpassed operating revenues. By the middle of the 20th century, the LC&N; ‚Äî once a widely diversified company ‚Äî had become largely dependent on coal revenues, while subsidiaries owned the railroads and other more- profitable arms. The softening of demand for coal, as railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesels and other forms of heating came into wider use, cut deeply into corporate profits. Consequently, various boards oversaw gradual contraction of the company and sales of bits and pieces. In 1966, Greenwood Stripping Co. bought the remaining coal properties, most located as originally exploited along the Panther Creek Valley, and sold them eight years later to Bethlehem Mines Corp. In 1986, shareholders dissolved the company after it sold its last business, Cella's Chocolate Covered Cherries, to Tootsie Roll.http://articles.mcall.com/1986-06-08/news/2521866_1_parton-coal-industry- lehigh-coal = The new company = The company name remained associated with anthracite mining through the independently founded and otherwise unrelated Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, incorporated in 1988. While unrelated legally, the 'New Company' as it's known in the area was spearheaded by a previous officer and stockholder: James J. Curran Jr. took over Lehigh Coal from Bethlehem Mines Corp. in 1989, and through the 1990s it remained the largest producer of U.S. anthracite, which is now a specialty product. In 2000, Lehigh Coal shut down and laid-off 163 employees, saying plunging coal prices made it impossible to make a profit. The company reopened in 2001 with help of a last-resort $9 million loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 2010, in bankruptcy proceedings once again,LC&N; sold at auction the company was purchased by one of its bigger creditors at auction, BET Associates, who were affiliated with Toll Brothers. The company properties in between Lansford and Nesquehoning, boasting an EPA permit sign in the same Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company name at the company gates along Rt-209 were observed in operation during mid-July 2013.

After Qin's defeat, he nominally submitted to Tang imperial authority and contended for control of the central-lower Yangtze River region with Yang Xingmi; he was eventually defeated by Yang and executed. His subordinate Ma Yin was the eventual founder of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Chu.  Background and service under Qin Zongquan  It is not known when Sun Ru was born. His family was from Henan County, one of the two counties making up the Tang Dynasty eastern capital Luoyang. At some point, he became a low-level officer at Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), where he befriended fellow officer Liu Jianfeng. Later, during the rebellion by the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, Sun served under the command of Qin Zongquan.New Book of Tang, vol. 188. By 884, Huang had been defeated and killed, but Qin, who then controlled Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) as its military governor (Jiedushi), then became a rebel himself against Emperor Xizong of Tang. As of late 884, Qin was sending a number of his officers to attack or seize territory around his. As part of Qin's campaigns, Sun seized Luoyang, Meng Prefecture (Â≠üÂ∑û, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), and Guo Prefecture (Ëô¢Â∑û, in modern Sanmenxia). In summer 885, however, he was again battling the Tang defender of Luoyang, Li Hanzhi, for control of Luoyang. It was said that while Li initially abandoned Luoyang after running out of food supplies, Sun only occupied Luoyang for about a month, before burning the palaces, government offices, and houses, and leaving Luoyang after plundering it, allowing Li to again occupy Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. In late 886, Qin sent Sun to capture Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and Sun did so, forcing the Tang prefect of Zheng, Li Fan (), to flee to Daliang (Â§ßÊ¢Å, in modern Kaifeng, Henan), then under control of the Tang general Zhu Quanzhong. Sun then attacked and seized Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang), forcing the acting military governor of Heyang, Zhuge Zhongfang (), to flee to Daliang as well. Sun claimed the title of military governor of Heyang, but Tang generals Zhang Quanyi and Li, in alliance with each other, stationed themselves at Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), respectively, and continued to resist Sun. In summer 887, Qin gathered his forces and made an attempt to destroy Zhu once and for all, but was defeated by Zhu and his allies Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin. Upon hearing of Qin's defeat, most of the officers he sent to the various surrounding regions abandoned their posts and fled. Sun also abandoned Heyang, and it was said that he slaughtered its people and burned its houses. Heyang Circuit came under the joint control of Li and Zhang.  Seizure of Yang Prefecture  In fall 887, with Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) recently thrown into a state of confusion and war due to internecine battles between the military governor Gao Pian and Gao's officers L√º Yongzhi, Qin Yan, Yang Xingmi, and Bi Shiduo, among others, which resulted in a Yang Xingmi victory but the capital Yang Prefecture () and surrounding regions being laid waste, Qin Zongquan sent his brother Qin Zongheng () and Sun Ru southeast to try to wrest the control of Huainan from Yang Xingmi. (Serving under them were, among others, Liu Jianfeng, Zhang Ji (), Ma Yin, and Qin Zongquan's cousin Qin Yanhui (). They quickly advanced on Yang Prefecture and seized the food supplies that Yang Xingmi had brought to Yang Prefecture during his recent siege against Qin Yan and Bi, and they put Yang Prefecture under siege. However, with Qin Zongquan recently having been defeated by Zhu Quanzhong, Qin Zongheng was ordered by Qin Zongquan to return to Cai Prefecture to aid Qin Zongquan and tried to do so. Sun, believing that Qin Zongquan was nearing defeat, refused to do so. Upon further orders by Qin Zongheng to prepare to do so, Sun killed him and took over the army. Qin Zongheng's officer An Renyi (), instead of submitting to Sun, surrendered to Yang Xingmi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Sun invited Qin Yan and Bi to join his army, and they did so. Together, they attacked and seized Gaoyou (È´òÈÉµ, in modern Yangzhou), forcing Yang Xingmi's ally Zhang Shenjian () to flee to Yang Xingmi. However, Sun then began to strip Qin Yan and Bi of their troops, in spring 888, Sun, believing in accusations that Qin Yan's and Bi's subordinate Tang Hong () laid against them that they were in communications with Zhu and were encouraging him to attack Sun, killed Qin Yan and Bi. Meanwhile, Yang Xingmi, believing that he could not contend with Sun for control of Yang Prefecture at this point, began to evacuate his own troops back to his original base at Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui), and when Sun finally attacked Yang Prefecture in summer 888, he captured it fairly easily as Yang Xingmi fled. Sun thereafter claimed the title of military governor of Huainan.  Subsequent campaign against Yang Xingmi, defeat, and death  Yang Xingmi, instead of returning to Lu Prefecture, captured Xuan Prefecture (ÂÆ£Â∑û, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), the capital of Xuanshe Circuit (); he was subsequently named the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe by then-emperor Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. As he was doing so, Sun Ru attacked Lu Prefecture, and Yang's subordinate Cai Chou (), whom Yang left in charge of Lu, surrendered it. Meanwhile, in late 889, Zhu Quanzhong, who had been named the military governor of Huainan by the imperial government in addition to the circuits that he already held, sent his officer Pang Shigu () to attack Huainan, but after Sun defeated him in spring 890 at Lingting (Èôµ‰∫≠, in modern Taizhou, Jiangsu), Pang withdrew. Still, fearing a joint attack by Zhu and Yang, Sun sought peaceful relations with Zhu, and Zhu initially agreed; at Zhu's recommendation, Emperor Zhaozong named Sun the military governor of Huainan, but soon thereafter, Zhu broke off the relations and killed Sun's emissaries. At this time, Yang still held some of prefectures southeast of Yang Prefecture ‚Äî Chang (Â∏∏Â∑û, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), Run (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), and Su (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu). In fall 890, Sun, while himself attacking Run Prefecture, had Liu Jianfeng capture Chang Prefecture, killing Yang's subordinate Zhang Xingzhou (). Around the new year 891, Sun further took Su Prefecture and killed Yang's subordinate Li You (). Upon hearing that Su had fallen, An Renyi, whom Yang had put in charge of Run Prefecture, abandoned it, and Sun took control of the region. In spring 891, Sun continued to pursue his campaign against Yang, pushing closer to Xuan Prefecture and defeating Yang's forces under An and Tian Jun multiple times, although his advances were briefly thwarted by Li Shenfu. Sun advanced to Huangchi (ÈªÉÊ±†, in modern Wuhu, Anhui), and Yang's forces, under Liu Wei () and Yang's brother-in-law Zhu Yanshou, were defeated when they tried to attack Sun there. However, in summer 891, floods greatly damaged Sun's camp, and Sun withdrew back to Yang Prefecture. However, he sent his officers Kang Wang () and An Jingsi () to seize He (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) and Chu (ÊªÅÊ¥≤, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) Prefectures, respectively. However, Li Shenfu soon counterattacked and recaptured those prefectures. Meanwhile, as Sun had previously feared, Zhu Quanzhong and Yang Xingmi entered into a pact against him, but by this point, encouraged by his own battlefield successes, he decided to pool his forces together and destroy Yang first before heading back north to face Zhu, so he burned Yang Prefecture, forced the adults to cross the Yangtze River south, and slaughtered the old and the young, while taking all of his troops and again headed toward Xuan Prefecture. Yang Xingmi, whose officers Zhang Xun () and Li Decheng then entered and took Yang Prefecture, tried to intercept him at Guangde (Âª£Âæ∑, in modern Xuancheng), but Sun surrounded Yang's camp and put it under siege; only through the efforts of Yang's officer Li Jian () was Yang able to fight out of the siege. Meanwhile, another warlord, Qian Liu, then in control of the Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) region, seized Su Prefecture and sent food aid to Yang. Yang, nevertheless, in fear of Sun's much larger army, considered abandoning Xuan in spring 892. At Liu Wei's and Li Shenfu's urging that doing so would mean disaster and that he should wear Sun's forces out by defending Xuan, he remained at Xuan and defended it. Further, at the suggestion of Dai Yougui (), Yang sent the refugees from Yang Prefecture back to Yang Prefecture, hoping that if they settled back in, the news would destroy the morale among Sun's soldiers by making them miss Yang Prefecture. Sun put Xuan Prefecture under siege, but with all of his forces at Xuan, Yang's officers retook Chang and Run Prefectures. Yang then repeatedly defeated Sun in battles, while Zhang Xun cut off Sun's food supply routes. Sun was forced to send out some of his forces, under Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin, to pillage the surrounding areas for food. In summer 892, after Sun contracted malaria and Yang received news of this, Yang decided to make one decisive surprise attack against Sun's camp. On July 3, with it raining hard at the time and the sky dark, Yang launched his attack, crushing Sun's forces. Tian captured Sun, and Yang beheaded Sun and sent his head to the imperial capital Chang'an. Liu Jianfeng and Ma, hearing of the defeat, took the remnants and fled south to Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), allowing Yang to take control of the entire Huainan region. Years later, after Ma eventually took control of the Hunan region, he petitioned the imperial government to posthumously honor Sun and create Sun the Prince of Le'an. He also built a temple dedicated to Sun.  Notes and references  * New Book of Tang, vol. 188. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 256, 257, 258, 259.

In 1943, Fayyaz was promoted to a teaching position in the Faculty of Theology at Tehran University. During this period, he was teaching the history of Islam and Islamic heresiography. In 1950, Fayyaz returned to Mashhad to establish a Faculty of Letters there. He taught for most of the 1950s in the newly founded faculties of letters and theology at the University of Mashhad. In time, he returned to Tehran University to serve as the head of the Department of Religious Studies. Fayyaz retired from his academic posts in 1967 and took up residence for the rest of his life in Mashhad. Literary and Academic Achievements In the 1930s, Fayyaz served awhile as the head of a literary circle in Mashhad named Anjuman-i adabi bahƒÅr. It was during his residence in Mashhad that Fayyaz held the post of editor-in-chief of the literary journal NƒÅma-yi ƒÄstƒÅn-i Quds. Fayyaz was a close friend of Iranian famous diplomat, litterateur, and physician Dr. Qasim Ghani. Fayyaz and Ghani jointly edited Tarikh-i Bayhaqi, one of the most important chronicles and pieces of prose in Persian written by the Ghaznavid scribe and bureaucrat Abu'l-Fazl Bayhaqi (d. 1078). Later in his life, Fayyaz acquired more manuscripts of this work and his own edition of Bayhaqi's chronicle was posthumously published by the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Press in 1972. Fayyaz was a polyglot scholar mastered in Arabic, French, English, and Russian and just started to learn Chinese shortly before his death in 1972.

Born in southern England, at Waltham in Essex, Lawrence was given a religious education, and excelled at singing and poetry composition. In his youth Lawrence joined Durham Cathedral Priory and became a Benedictine monk. In the 1130s Lawrence became a courtier of Geoffrey Rufus, bishop of Durham. After the latter's death, Lawrence was a leading opponent of William Cumin, claimant to the vacant episcopate during the first half of the decade, and suffered brief exile from the monastery. After Cumin's defeat and the accession of William de Ste Barbe, Lawrence became sub-prior and then prior of Durham. During his lifetime as a monk of Durham, Lawrence wrote several important works in Latin, including the Dialogi, the Hypognosticon, and a hagiography of Saint Brigd for Ailred of Rievaulx. Life and career Lawrence was born at Waltham, Essex, a place that Lawrence claimed was renowned for its poets.Raine, Dialogi, pp. xxvii, 40‚Äì41; Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts, p. 144; Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\" A date of around 1114 has been suggested for his birth, but this is uncertain; other potential dates put forward include c. 1110 and c. 1100.Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\"; Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 54 Growing taller than average, he was educated at the church of Waltham Abbey, the church of the Holy Cross, before entering Durham Cathedral Priory as a novice during the episcopate of Ranulf Flambard (bishop of Durham, 1099‚Äì1128).Raine, Dialogi, pp. xxviii‚Äìxxix, 43‚Äì44; Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\" Two teachers of the Waltham school‚ÄîAthelard and his son Peter‚Äîare known from this era, and it is likely that one of them was Lawrence's instructor.Raine, Dialogi, p. xxviii Waltham, founded by in the first half of the 11th century, had been a property of Durham from the episcopate of William Walcher until its acquisition by Queen Matilda early in the reign of Henry I.Knowles and Hadcock, p. 178; Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts, p. 144, Rollason, Libellus, p. 212, n. 94 According to his own account, he continued his education at Durham, learning the trivium and quadrivium, with Virgil, Plato and Plotinus among his favourite authors.Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts, pp. 144‚Äì45 If Lawrence's own testimony is to be believed, he was held in high acclaim in his early years for his poetry and fine singing.Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\" In Lawrence's time as a teacher, he may have taught Ailred, later abbot of Rievaulx. Lawrence took up a place in the bishop's court during the episcopate of Geoffrey Rufus (1133‚Äì1141). Probably an episcopal chaplain, Lawrence was cantor and may have held the post of receiver general in Bishop Geoffrey's exchequer.Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 59; Raine, Dialogi, p. xxix After Bishop Geoffrey's death, one of Geoffrey's former courtiers, William Cumin, arranged to have himself made the new bishop.Young, William Cumin, pp. 11‚Äì12 Although winning support from most local potentates (though notably not Robert de Conyers), Cumin failed to secure the consent of the monastic chapter or the archdeacon, who insisted on a canonical election.Young, William Cumin, pp. 14‚Äì15 For two years William had the support of earl of Northumberland Henry and his father the Scottish king, along with other Matildines, making his struggle for recognition part of The Anarchy, the wider struggle between Stephen de Blois and the Empress Matilda for the throne of England.Young, William Cumin, pp. 12‚Äì14 Cumin lost most of this support by the end of 1142, neutralising the dispute, and in 1143 William de Ste Barbe was elected at York as the new bishop.Young, William Cumin, pp. 20‚Äì21 Cumin subsequently seized the priory and ejected the monks, including Lawrence.Young, William Cumin, pp. 11, 22 Lawrence's opposition, as expressed in his writings, was vehement, and he has been described as \\"one of the most persistent opponents of Cumin\\".Young, William Cumin, p. 11 Subsequently, Lawrence rose in station within the hierarchy of the priory. Lawrence held the office of sub-prior [deputy prior] by November 1147.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 43; Le Neve, Fasti, p. 33 Following the death of Prior RogerUdo Kindermann,Zum Brief des Bernhard von Clairvaux an Prior Roger, in: Analecta Cisterciensia 26 (1970), S. 248‚Äì252 in either 1148 or 1149, Lawrence took over the leadership of the priory itself, and is named for the first time in such capacity in 1149.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 43; Le Neve, Fasti, pp. 33‚Äì34 As prior of Durham, the most important ecclesiastical office in the diocese after the bishop, he remained until his death.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 43; Le Neve, Fasti, pp. 33‚Äì34; Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\" Lawrence died on either 16 March or 18 March 1154. Lawrence had gone to Rome to seek confirmation of the election of Hugh du Puiset as bishop of Durham, the replacement of William de Ste Barbe who had died in 1152.Le Neve, Fasti, p. 30; Rigg, \\"Durham, Lawrence of\\" It was on his return, while in a French town, that illness took him. His body was later taken and buried at Durham. Writings His earliest work appears to be his Vita Sanctae Brigidae, a Latin hagiography of the Irish Gaelic saint Brigid of Kildare.Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 54 The story, Lawrence tells us, was that Lawrence had received from Ailred's father a hagiography of the saint written in a \\"half-barbaric\\" [semibarbarum] style. Lawrence polished it up, and sent it to Ailred while the latter was a member of the court of David I, King of the Scots; that is, between 1130 and 1134.Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 54; Sharpe, Medieval Irish Saints Lives, p. 33, n. 121 Lawrence's letter to Ailred survives.For which, see \\"Survey of the Unedited Work of Laurence of Durham\\", pp. 249‚Äì265; see also Sharpe, Medieval Irish Saints Lives, p. 33, n. 121 Lawrence's most famous work in the Middle Ages‚Äîsurviving in at least 17 manuscript copies‚Äîwas the Hypognosticon (meaning, according to Lawrence, abbreviation).Edited by Susanne Daub, Gottes Heilsplan ‚Äì verdichtet. Edition des Hypognosticon des Laurentius Dunelmensis, Erlangen 2002; Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, pp. 54, 340, n. 153 This he wrote during his years [before 1141] at Bishop Geoffrey's court. It is a nine-book epic of unrhymed couplets, recounting the biblical tale of mankind from the creation to the present.Summarised by Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, pp. 54‚Äì58 Lawrence had been composing a metrical version of the Bible, though becoming a member of the episcopal court meant he was only able to compose 40 lines per day.Raine, Dialogi, p. xxx He managed to get the work up to a good size when it disappeared one Christmas, stolen, Lawrence thought, by a maid-servant.Raine, Dialogi, pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi The Hypognosticon, an improved version of what he could remember of this work, was written in the space of one month.; Raine, Dialogi, p. xxx; Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 340, n. 153 Another major work, the Dialogi, has been hailed as Lawrence's \\"most original work\\".Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 58 The work is a set of dialogues, in four books, averaging c. 550 lines of elegiacs. The dialogues feature Lawrence, Philip, another monk of Durham, and a Breton named Peter. In the first two books, where Lawrence and Philip are in exile, Lawrence describes his longing for the good times of Bishop Geoffrey's era, describes the great things of Durham, and disparages Cumin and the behaviour of his soldiers .Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 59 In books iii and iv, when the two Durham monks have been allowed to return by Cumin, Lawrence recounts his own upbringing, and the characters debate various moral points.Summarised by Rigg, History of Anglo- Latin Literature, pp. 59‚Äì61 Another work attributed to Lawrence, the Consolatio de Morte Amici [\\"Consolation on the Death of a Friend\\"],Latin Text edited and translated into German by Udo Kindermann, Soll man um Tote trauern? Eine Antwort aus dem Jahre 1141 in der Consolatio des Laurentius von Durham, Erlangen 2010; is a prosimetrum of 15 metra and 16 prose sections, closely modelled on Boethius's De Consolatione Philosophiae.Rigg, History of Anglo- Latin Literature, p. 57, and p. 341, n. 158 Lawrence, grieving over the death of his friend Paganus, is persuaded not to mourn by an interlocutor, who insists on the immortality of Paganus' soul and God's love.Rigg, History of Anglo-Latin Literature, p. 57 Further, five speeches written in prose are extant:Edited by Udo Kindermann, Die f√ºnf Reden des Laurentius von Durham, in: Mittellateinisches Jahrbuch 8 (1971), S. 108‚Äì141 Laurentius pro Laurentio (attacking unjust allegations and tyranny), Pro in Malgerium (rebutting an allegation of sedition), Pro Iuvenibus (defending some men who louted a ship wreck), Pro Milone (defending a suitor of a noble girl) and Pro Naufragis (reprimanding the people of Durham for bad treatment of wrecked sailors). Among other works of Lawrence is the 6-line \\"Tempora nec Sexum Metuit\\", a reflection on mankind and the Fall written in the margin of one Hypognosticon manuscript; a 23-line rebuke of fickleness, \\"Aura Puer Mulier\\";Edited by Udo Kindermann, Laurentius von Durham, Consolatio de morte amici.

Contrary to the expectations of the Iraqi government, Shia Kuwaitis founded the local armed resistance movement during Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait in the Gulf War. Most Kuwaitis arrested, tortured and executed during the occupation bore Shia names. The Kuwaiti resistance's casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages. The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision. Shia citizens as a group are well integrated into the Kuwaiti state. Kuwaiti government policy, on paper and in practice, does not discriminate citizens on a sectarian basis. Kuwaiti Shia citizens are considered the most integrated Shia group in the GCC region.

New chairs, bathrooms, and a sound system were installed in September 1930 to meet the demands of the growing audience. The seat count would change twice again after that, once in 1931 and in 1936, jumping from 295 to 566, and finally to its peak at 900. In the 1950s Jerome Steel needed more help and hired his son Bill as co-manager. With his help, a major renovation took place in 1953, reducing the size of the theater from 900 seats to a more manageable 840 seats and installing art-deco features that would remain for the next 55 years. Among those features would be the rich red-velvet walls of the auditorium, beige vinyl cushions in the lobby, plaster floral-patterned indirect lighting, modeled after the Hanna Playhouse Theatre in Cleveland, and the concession stand moved to the inside of the theater.\\"The American Vernacular in the Apollo Theatre Oberlin, Ohio\\", Barnhouse, Dorothy. Blodgett, Geoffrey (1979) Jerome Steel died in 1959 and left Bill in charge of the theater. It was around this time that Bill began the last set of major renovations to happen until it was purchased by Oberlin College. The renovation involved the installation of terreza black glass, put up around the exterior of the theater as well as in the lobby. The marquee changed shape from a rectangular marquee to a diamond shape marquee, which made it easier for pedestrians to see. The stage was shortened by about four feet, and instruments were carved into the front doors acknowledging the conservatory‚Äôs commitment to the arts. A local carpenter, Bill Jones, did the carvings. Bill managed the theater for many years with the help of his wife, Arlene, and his brother, Sandy, but in 2008 the theater was put up for sale. Although many buyers stepped forward, the Steels made the choice to sell the theater to Oberlin College with the agreement that it would still be used as a movie theater for both college and town. Recent history The Apollo Theatre undergoing renovation in 2008. The Apollo Theatre was purchased by a wholly owned subsidiary of Oberlin College in February 2009. Two public meetings were held by the college to discuss future renovations and plans for the theater.Oberlin News Tribune February 25th 2009 edition Around the same time, a coalition of townspeople and college students formed Mission Apollo, a group that encouraged the college to maintain the single-screen theater and preserve the existing fa√ßade, marquee and interior. The college hired Cleveland Cinemas to manage the theater shortly before the first set of renovations took place in the summer of 2009. The theater shut down in July and reopened in October 2009 with several new features but also the disappearance of some Apollo staples. The theater has remained a mainstay in the Oberlin community at its comfortable locale in downtown Oberlin, and in 2012 became the centerpiece for The Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman Cinema Studies Center for Media Education and Production. It includes editing labs, an animation area, a recording studio and small projection screening room.Farkas, Karen (September 20, 2012). \\"Apollo Theatre in Oberlin reopens and includes new home for cinema studies department\\".

Located in Inkerman Street, St Kilda East, since its establishment in 1914, the parish is in the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and is the smallest parish in terms of geographical area. From its beginnings in the chapel of St John's Theological College the church has been observantly Anglo-Catholic in its traditions of liturgy and teaching. Since the 1940s the municipality has gradually become the heart of Melbourne's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. The parish was founded in 1914, the church building commenced in early 1915 with the first regular Sunday service in the completed church on 27 June 1915. History =Establishment= The parish was founded in 1914 coinciding with the subdivision of local market gardens and agistment paddocks as Melbourne's suburbs expanded. Although the larger churches of All Saints' East St Kilda, St Mary's Caulfield and Holy Trinity Balaclava were nearby, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Lowther Clarke, responded positively to petitioners for a new parish and determined that there was sufficient support for the establishment of another parish in the easternmost part of what was then St Kilda. Prior to the establishment of the parish, All Saints' East St Kilda had provided the outreach of the Leslie Street Mission Hall for the people of the area from 15 October 1896 until sometime in 1911. =Origins at St John's Theological College= A number of local people had worshipped for some years with the students at St John's Theological College, a five-acre site located at 195-201 Alma Road, St Kilda East (and formerly the old Cumloden School from 1891 to 1905). In 1906 Archbishop Lowther Clarke appointed Reginald Stephen as warden of St John's Theological College, which he held concurrently as the Dean of Melbourne from 1910 until his appointment as the Bishop of Tasmania in February 1914.J. Cable, \\"Stephen, Reginald (1860‚Äì1956)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1990, accessed online 1 November 2014. St John's was intended to provide theological training for non-matriculated men without the means to enter university. John Stephen Hart was a lecturer at the college from 1907, succeeding Stephen as warden and chaplain in 1914.B. H. Reddrop, 'Hart, John Stephen (1866‚Äì1952)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1983, accessed online 1 November 2014. Preston (2011) reports that Ridley College was \\"opened in 1910 by an evangelical faction, competed with St John's, and was the preferred option of the evangelically minded rural Bendigo and Gippsland dioceses.\\" In 1919 the theological college was closed by the dioceseJames Grant, \\"Clarke, Henry Lowther (1850‚Äì1926)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1981, accessed online 1 November 2014 as it was deemed that the Tractarian influences fostered by the college were at odds with the preferred churchmanship of the diocese. This was despite Hart having recently been elected as Dean of Melbourne; the closure of the college left Hart without an income as the position of dean was non-stipendiary at the time. Shortly afterwards in 1920 the property was sold, the buildings demolished, the site subdivided and bisected by the creation of Wilgah Street. =Foundation= By 1914 the local members of the congregation had grown to such an extent that the college chapel had become crowded during services.St James‚Äô newsletter, The Church Paper, No. 2. July 1914, pp. 3-4. Some of the local members of the congregation petitioned for the establishment of a parish church where they could continue the Anglo-Catholic liturgical practices to which they were accustomed. Archbishop Clarke excised lands from the parishes of All Saints‚Äô East St Kilda and St Mary's Caulfield in spite of the vigorous protests from both of these parishes.Preston, L. F. (2011) \\"Not Viable ‚Äì A study of St James the Great, East St Kilda\\", Conference paper delivered at the Australia and New Zealand History of Education Society, Auckland New Zealand, 6‚Äì9 December 2011. Land was procured on the corner of Inkerman and Alexandra Streets in two lots: the first to build a church on Inkerman Street on 28 May 1913 for ¬£879, the second lot for the establishment of a vicarage behind the church in a \\"battle axe block\\" on 24 April 1914 for ¬£500. The new parish was promulgated on 19 April 1914 at the college and the college chapel continued to be their home until 21 June 1915. The choice of St James as the patron saint of the parish reflected the relationship with St John's College as the apostles James and John were also brothers (the sons of Zebedee). The foundation stone of church building was laid by Archbishop Lowther Clarke on 10 April 1915. In the service which accompanied the laying of the stone he acknowledged the hospitality of St John's Theological College in making available its chapel to the congregation while the church was being built, as well as publicly announcing the death the previous day of Bishop James Moorhouse. The church was dedicated by Archbishop Lowther Clarke some three months later on 23 June 1915 (a Wednesday), with services commencing the following Sunday, 27 June 1915. The vicarage was completed in 1918, with the incumbent, the Revd J. C. Nankivell, raising more than ¬£200 \\"singlehandedly\\" towards the costs. A church hall (now St James House) was completed in 1958 and a separate kindergarten building in 1965. =Early years as a parish church= The first incumbent was Garnet Eric Shaw, a graduate of the University of Melbourne, taking his BA while resident at Trinity College, and then completing his theological training through St John's College (ThL).Enrolment records, 1907, Trinity College Archives. He was ordained as a priest in 1911 and appointed as the first Anglican chaplain to the Australian Navy in 1912. Shaw was well accustomed to life at sea, having previously worked extensively in the pearling industry, and holding both a mate's and a master's mariner certificates. He resigned from the Navy because he objected to compulsory attendance at divine service for naval personnel, which was at odds with Navy policy at that time. After the outbreak of the Great War, he decided to resign from the parish and enlisted for active service. It was reported at the time that he did not intend to return to ministry after the war, defending his position that \\"though the Church [was] right in its principles, it [did] not always follow its principles into practice\\". Shaw survived the war, having been accepted for officer training and active service in France, and eventually being appointed a chaplain in the AIF. After the war he returned to parish life: his war service records indicate that in applying for his service medals (British War Medal, and Victory Medal) he was the incumbent of All Soul's South Sassafras (Kallista) in 1924.http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au NAA: B2455, Shaw Garnet Eric The first churchwarden of St James was Arthur Knox, a member of the parish until his death at the age of 84 in 1944. The next incumbent, A. B. Burnaby, was inducted on 2 February 1916 having previously been the curate of the neighbouring parish of All Saints. Burnaby became ill soon after and was unable to continue with his duties in December 1916. A.E. Wood served as interim for approximately three months until June 1917, prior to taking up duties at Christ Church South Yarra. In July 1917 John Cuthbert Nankivell was appointed, only to be removed by the archbishop in 1919 despite the support of many parishionersDioc.

(c.1998) Melbourne Anglicanism: A Distinctive Culture?\\" http://web.stpeters.org.au/ausanglican/melbourne.shtml, accessed 25 January 2015 His removal coincided with the closure of St John's College. It was reported in the press that he had resigned the parish in favour of a temporary appointment as hospital chaplain pending his return to Great Britain. Canon M. A. Snodgrass, the previous incumbent of St Paul's Geelong, was appointed to St James' in April 1919, married Elsie Kiddle of Toorak in 1922, and then resigned in November 1923 after which they departed for an extended tour of Europe, arriving back in Australia in May 1925. Snodgrass died in December 1929. H. R. Potter, having previously served with Canon Snodgrass at St Paul's Geelong, was vicar until April 1936 when W. Albert Shaw was appointed. Shaw, who had previously been vicar of St Cuthbert's Brunswick East for 19 years, was 62 years of age when he arrived at St James and was incumbent for five years until his death in December 1941. =Vicars= * G.

Bower (2019- =Building and grounds= Construction commenced at the beginning of the First World War: the original church building (and the vicarage ) were modest and restrained; the sanctuary end (liturgical east) facing south. There was very little sanctuary area ‚Äì comprising a \\"wooden chancel on the south side where it [was] proposed ultimately to extend... in accordance with the plans\\" and the interior brickwork was pointed but not rendered. The internal roof structure was lined with exposed beams and remains so to this day. Originally from the north and south transepts of All Saints' East St Kilda, the pews in St James‚Äô were \\"donated\\" by All Saints' which nonetheless billed St James' for their removal and for the renovation of the transept floors. Brass plates of the original renters of the pews at All Saints' are still visible. The first incumbent, Shaw, objected to pew rents on principle, and refused to institute this practice at St James. The original intention was to build in stages, with the ultimate church arranged in proper liturgical axis (sanctuary eastwards) featuring a long nave and west door facing onto Alexandra Street, to be \\"surmounted by a large square tower, with a spire in the centre\\". Tennis courts and a clubhouse were added in early 1922, opened by Archbishop Lees in April of that year. A photograph of the occasion shows a comparatively large congregation. The following year the annual church bazaar (including merry-go rounds for the children) was held in the then ample parish grounds to augment income for the parish. It was formally opened by the archbishop's wife. Some five years earlier the then incumbent sought permission from the St Kilda Council to use the council \\"small hall\\" for a jumble sale to aid the establishment of the free kindergarten. Walter Green (incumbent 1942‚Äì1960) realised that it was unlikely that the original plans would come to pass and accordingly, in the late 1950s, he decided to extend the 1915 nave by building the present sanctuary and vicarage together with an ambulatory leading into a lady chapel made possible by extending the former nursery school building. A sacristy, incense room, vestry and oratory were also built and the interior brickwork of the church was rendered and painted. In the early 1960s, during the incumbency of Harry Reynolds Smythe, the present narthex and porch were added, as was the porch and the Walsingham Shrine of the lady chapel. The narthices of both the church and chapel are of a somewhat post-modern style (before its time) as opposed to the Gothic sympathy of the original 1915 building. The four smaller windows of the 1915 building on the liturgical north wall have been replaced with three \\"sea\\" windows; the last window was not replaced to accommodate the chamber organ.

Whilst this provided a significant income for the parish for some fifty years, the service station eventually closed at the end of 2008 and the site remained vacant for five years, resulting in financial hardship for the parish. Despite protest by the vicar and the wardens the corner site was sold by the diocese in 2011. In 2013 a three-storey apartment building was constructed on the site. =Windows= Many of the stained glass windows in St James the Great are the unique work of Czech-Australian artist Miroslav Dismas Zika. The windows are examples of hagiography and illustrative of Christian teachings. The three blue windows on the liturgical south wall represent the ocean on which the ark of the church bears its members to salvation. The lady chapel has nine clerestory windows on the western wall (the liturgical north), depicting the story of salvation from the creation to the revelation of Jesus and his death and resurrection. The theme continues as at the liturgical west end of the chapel where two antique streaky amber stained glass windows frame Zika's interpretation of the Heavenly Jerusalem ‚Äì the reward of the faithful.

Most of Zika's works were predominantly for Roman Catholic churches, including Tarrawarra Abbey. Following medieval precedent, he dated his work by a significant event of the day, namely the hanging of Ronald Ryan. He etched a Latin inscription into the glass near the base of the window which can be translated as \\"Dismas made this in 1967 at the beginning of the month when Bolte, scandalous, arrogant, was demanding Ryan suffer capital punishment.\\" \\"Bolte\\", the then Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, considered this objectionable. A front-page article in The Age on 4 May 1967 reported that, in response to Bolte's protests, Frank Woods, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, had apologised by letter to the premier, clarifying that the inscription had neither been included in the original design brief nor had any \\"official authorisation\\". The article went on to say that the offending words had been erased, although the vicar, Harry Smythe (1923‚Äì2005), refused to confirm just how this had been done. Zika remained unrepentant. There are various theories as to how the inscription was hidden including the rubbing of a burnt cork over the offending words or similarly the covering of the etched inscription using a soft lead pencil. Cleaning of the window over the years has revealed the inscription ‚Äì the \\"removal\\" was achieved in 1967 by filling in the etching with a soft leaded pencil. Today, however, the Latin inscription is visible once again. Image:St James the Great East St Kilda.jpgEpiphany window Image:St James the Great Epiphany Window Inscription.jpgEpiphany window inscription Image:St James the Great Epiphany Window detailed section.jpgEpiphany window inscription in detail Present =Music= Sunday Masses at the church are conducted in English except for the Kyrie eleison which alternates between Greek and English. The modern rite of the Mass is performed at least 3 Sundays each month and features the Gloria, Sanctus and Benedictus from the 1969 \\"Parish congregational mass in honour of the unsung saints\\" by Australian composer Albert Edwin Lynch. The Kyrie eleison, Sursum corda and the Acclamation after the Consecration (The Mystery of Faith) are in plainchant. The Agnus Dei is from the 1971 \\"A Community Mass\\" by Richard Proulx. The proper part of the mass features a Responsorial Psalm in plainchant. The Gospel Acclamation (Alleluia and verse) is usually the triple alleluia chant in Mode VI. The service usually includes a Gradual hymn before the Gospel Acclamation, an Offertory hymn and a Post Communion / Dismissal hymn. Hymns are selected from the Australian Hymn Book. Organ solos are usually played during the opening procession, communion and at the end of service. The church has a team of cantors who sing the propers of the Mass each week and lead congregational singing. Occasional choirs and musicians participate in the liturgical music, particularly the Canterbury Singers who are informally based at St James‚Äô and the Clerkes of St James who sing settings of the Mass on special occasions and feast days. The parish has a long association with Trio Con Brio (cello, oboe and flute) and other instrumentalists and musicians who enrich the music life of the congregation. As of 2014, the church has two organs. The chamber organ is registered with the National Trust.Smith Organ & Joscelyne Organ (St James the Great Anglican Church). Retrieved on 19 November 2015. It was built in Tasmania by Samuel Joscelyne in the 1860s and installed in the church in 1988 replacing a chamber organ, made by John Smith of Bristol, which had been sold to St Matthew's Bega in New South Wales. The Joscelyne organ has one manual and an octave pedal board with a range from G2 ‚Äì G3 (rather than the more customary C2- C3). John Maidment (2007), of the Organ Historical Trust of Australia, has said that the \\"instrument is of interest for its superlative casework in Australian cedar (Toona Australis) and its outstanding craftsmanship. The casework is one of the largest surviving examples of 19th century Australian furniture and is notable for the excellence of its design; it has a splendid cornice, decorated with carved paterae, carved central cresting with scroll motifs in contrary motion, raised case panels and four flats containing dummy wooden \\"flatback\\" pipes covered in gold leaf and backed in red silk; the centre of each opening is surmounted by a carved curving rococo-style motif. The sides of the console opening have fretted inset panels while the large brass nameplate simply has \\"Joscelyne\\" engraved in copperplate script.\\" In 2011 a \\"Johannus Opus 20\\" organ was purchased to complement the Jocelyne organ. It has a wider range of application than the chamber organ and a pedal board arrangement to which visiting organists are more accustomed. The church has a Kawai studio grand piano, on permanent loan from one of the congregation. All three instruments are used in the church's liturgy.

St James supported the 2nd East St Kilda scout troop in the years following the Great War. Since 2002 it has been host to the St Kilda Steiner Pre-SchoolSt Kilda Steiner Pre-School; St Kilda Steiner Pre-School website, access date 30 May 2013 which aims that \\"children (will) take part in a mixed-age, play-based curriculum in a nurturing environment where learning is by imitation rather than direction\\".St Kilda Steiner Pre-School: Steiner Education; St Kilda Steiner Pre-School website, access date 30 May 2013. =Childcare= A decision by the wardens resulted in St James' House being let to a childcare organisation, Little Patch Early Learning Centre. This is in keeping with the tradition of service to the community by the parish and is hoped will lead to increased financial viability of the parish.

After studies in his hometown, Henry was forced while traveling to take shelter during a storm at Bordeaux, where he settled and became a partner with a merchant who sent him to Saint-Domingue. He returned to France after the Haitian Revolution, and learned the restoration of paintings from fellow artists. He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault. He augmented his skill in restoration with expertise learned during travels to Italy, Belgium, and England. This led to his gaining a position as an expert commissioner with the Royal Museums.

When he felt death approaching he decided to \\"ignite the flame of art\\" in his native town by donating his collection and establishing a museum. On the 29 July 1835 the town of Cherbourg inaugurated the Mus√©e Thomas-Henry, with Henry's collection of 163 paintings valued at 120,000 francs. Today the collection forms the basis of the Mus√©e des beaux-arts Thomas Henry, which has the third most important collection of paintings in Normandy, comprising over 300 paintings, dating principally from the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries.

Turner (1931‚Äì2002) also known as Bill Turner was an African- American school board member and state senator from Miami, Florida. He was a pioneer of racial integration, serving as the first black school board member in Dade County, and a supporter of education in the Florida legislature. Biography Turner was born in 1931, in the black community of Overtown in Miami. His parents died while he was young, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother. He graduated from Bethune-Cookman College, in Daytona, Florida, in 1956, with a bachelor's degree in education. He returned to Miami, where he worked as a police officer for a year before becoming an elementary school teacher in 1957. He continued to work as an educator for 13 years, both as a teacher and an administrator, during which time he received a Masters of Education degree from the University of Miami. In 1982, he also received a Doctor of Law degree from Faith College in Birmingham, AL. Turner began his political career in 1970, when he ran for the board of the county-wide school system and won the election over a white opponent. Turner became the first African-American to serve on the Dade County School Board. He served on the board until 1978, when he lost his re-election bid amid allegations of mismanaging funds for a community program he oversaw. Turner was eventually cleared of any criminal wrongdoing regarding those allegations, and he returned to working as a school administrator. In 1982, he ran again for the school board and was elected. He remained on the school board for the next 10 years, during two of which (1989-1991) he served as board chair. While on the board, Turner strongly supported desegregation, multicultural education, and school safety projects. Shortly before he left the board, it named a new vocational high school after him. William H. Turner Technical Arts High School opened in North Miami in 1993. Turner's time on the Dade County School Board ended in 1992, when he decided to vacate his seat in order to run for the Florida Senate. District 36, which included the areas of Allapattah, Liberty City, part of Little Havana, Opa-locka, El Portal, and Miami Shores, was without an incumbent, because the previous senator, Carrie Meek, was running for U.S. Congress. Turner beat State Rep. James Burke by 30 votes in the Democratic primary, winning the seat. Turner spent one 4-year term in the senate, before being defeated by his predecessor's son, Kendrick Meek, in 1998. Turner died of natural causes on November 1, 2002.

He was a running back for the University of Michigan from 1972 to 1974 and finished his playing career as the fifth all-time leading rusher in Michigan Wolverines football history. Heater has been an assistant football coach at ten universities since 1976. He has been affiliated with College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bo Schembechler (as a player), Earle Bruce (as an assistant at Ohio State and Colorado State), and Lou Holtz (as an assistant at Notre Dame). He has been on coaching staffs of national championship teams at Notre Dame (1988) and Florida (2006 and 2008). He is currently in his second stint as the defensive coordinator at Colorado State. Early years A native of West Virginia, Heater attended Columbian High School in Tiffin, Ohio. He rushed for more than 1,000 yards and scored more than 100 points in both his junior year in 1969 and his senior year in 1970. In his three years as a starter for Columbian, Heater accounted for 3,530 total yards and scored a total of 310 points, including 158 points as a senior. He was also selected as an All-Ohio player in his senior year. In February 1971, Heater announced that he had accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan. University of Michigan Heater played at the running back position for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1972 to 1974. He accumulated 1,995 rushing yards, 17 rushing touchdowns and averaged 4.9 yards per carry. In October 1972, Heater established himself as a star in his third game for Michigan, passing for two touchdowns and rushing for 94 yards and a third touchdown in a 35-7 victory over Navy. In its game coverage, the UPI credited Heater, who came into the game as a substitute, for firing the Wolverines' 28-point third quarter: > \\"THE Wolverines blew scoring opportunities and were sluggish on offense > until substitute Chuck Heater, a six-foot, 205-pound tailback from Tiffin, > Ohio, entered the game as Harry Banks' replacement in the second quarter. > The darting sophomore gained 89 yards, 59 of them in the third quarter when > he scored on a 13-yard run off left tackle to give Michigan a 28-0 lead.\\" Heater had four 100-yard rushing games for the Wolverines, gaining 155 yards against Illinois in 1972, 133 yards against Iowa in 1973, 128 yards against Indiana in 1973, and 101 yards against Wisconsin in 1974. His longest run from scrimmage was for a 71-yard gain against Indiana in 1973. As a sophomore in 1972, Heater reportedly found himself in Schembechler's doghouse after missing a day of practice after his wedding. The Chicago Tribune reported: \\"You know why Chuck Heater, the Michigan back, got in Coach Bo Schembechler's doghouse? Chuck skipped a day of practice for a honeymoon. Not sufficient excuse, ruled Bo.\\" At the time he completed his college career in 1974, Heater ranked fourth all-time among Michigan's career rushing leaders since official records were maintained starting in 1949. The only players ahead of him were Billy Taylor (3,072 yards), Ron Johnson (2,417 yards) and Ed Shuttlesworth (2,333 yards). Heater also received the Fielding Yost Award in 1975 as the most outstanding academic and athletic performance by a senior. The Wolverines compiled a record of 41-3-1 during Heater's four years with the team and won or tied for the Big Ten Conference championship every season. After completing his senior year at Michigan, Heater was selected to play as a running back for the Blue team in the 1974 Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic. Professional football Heater was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the 10th round (241st overall pick) of the 1975 NFL Draft. He signed with the Saints in June 1975, but he was released in early September 1975, shortly before the opening game of the regular season. Coaching career =Northern Arizona= When Heater was released by the Saints, he returned to Michigan for graduate work in educational psychology. In 1976, he learned from a friend about an opening on the coaching staff at Northern Arizona University. He was hired as the offensive backfield coach working under head coach Joe Salem. Heater took over a backfield that had fumbled 46 times in 1975. Under Heater's tutelage, the Northern Arizona backfield fumbled only 14 times in 1976. Northern Arizona running back Carl Golden also led the Big Sky Conference in rushing in 1976. Heater later recalled that he had no intention of coaching football when he graduated from Michigan. He said, \\"I found out it's what I know most about anyway ‚Äî football. I found out it's really what I wanted to do. Coaching is suited to my abilities.\\" =Toledo= In December 1976, after completing one season at Northern Arizona, Heater was hired by the University of Toledo near his hometown of Tiffin, Ohio. At Toledo, he joined the staff of head coach Chuck Stobart who had coached Heater at Michigan. Heater spent five years on the Toledo coaching staff, working as the running backs coach from 1977‚Äì1978 and as the secondary coach from 1979‚Äì1981. =Wisconsin= In 1982, Heater was hired by Wisconsin as the defensive backfield coach under head coach Dave McClain. Shortly after being hired at Wisconsin, Heater told a Wisconsin newspaper, \\"I don't think I'll be a legendary coach, but I want to do my job and do it well. If I do those things, I'll get where I want to go. I'm not going to worry about tomorrow. I'll just do well today and things will take care of themselves.\\" Heater remained at Wisconsin for three years. =Ohio State= In March 1985, Heater was hired by Ohio State as the secondary coach under head coach Earle Bruce. He spent three years on Bruce's staff at Ohio State and left when Bruce was fired at the end of the 1987 season. =Notre Dame= In February 1988, Heater was hired as the defensive secondary coach at Notre Dame under head coach Lou Holtz. He was on the Notre Dame coaching staff in 1988 when Notre Dame won its last national championship. He remained on Holtz's staff at Notre Dame for three years through the 1990 season. =Colorado State= In February 1991, Heater was hired as the defensive coordinator at Colorado State University. He joined the staff of Earle Bruce under whom he had coached at Ohio State four years earlier. At the time of the hiring, Bruce said, \\"Chuck is an outstanding coach who will fit well in our program.\\" Heater remained with Colorado State for two years but left after the 1992 season when Earl Bruce was fired as the team's head coach. =Colorado= In 1993, Heater was hired as the recruiting coordinator for the Colorado Buffaloes football team. Colorado head coach Bill McCartney had been an assistant coach at Michigan during Heater's senior year. In February 1994, after the NCAA eliminated the position of recruiting coordinator, McCartney hired Heater as his defensive secondary coach. In March 1995, Colorado's new head coach Rick Neuheisel moved Heater to a new position as the team's tight ends coach. He remained the tight ends coach at Colorado for four years from 1995 to 1998 and also resumed his duties as recruiting coordinator in 1998. =Washington= In January 1999, Heater followed Rick Neuheisel to the University of Washington, accepting a positions as cornerbacks coach and recruiting coordinator.

The sensitivity value is defined based on conditional variances which indicate the individual or joint effects of the uncertain inputs on the output. FAST first represents conditional variances via coefficients from the multiple Fourier series expansion of the output function. Then the ergodic theorem is applied to transform the multi- dimensional integral to a one-dimensional integral in evaluation of the Fourier coefficients. A set of incommensurate frequencies is required to perform the transform and most frequencies are irrational. To facilitate computation a set of integer frequencies is selected instead of the irrational frequencies. The integer frequencies are not strictly incommensurate, resulting in an error between the multi-dimensional integral and the transformed one-dimensional integral. However, the integer frequencies can be selected to be incommensurate to any order so that the error can be controlled meeting any precision requirement in theory. Using integer frequencies in the integral transform, the resulted function in the one-dimensional integral is periodic and the integral only needs to evaluate in a single period. Next, since the continuous integral function can be recovered from a set of finite sampling points if the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem is satisfied, the one- dimensional integral is evaluated from the summation of function values at the generated sampling points. FAST is more efficient to calculate sensitivities than other variance-based global sensitivity analysis methods via Monte Carlo integration. However the calculation by FAST is usually limited to sensitivities referring to ‚Äúmain effect‚Äù or ‚Äútotal effect‚Äù.

Foundation  = Variance-based sensitivity = Sensitivity indices of a variance-based method are calculated via ANOVA-like decomposition of the function for analysis. Suppose the function is Y = f\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right)=f\\\\left(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\right) where 0 \\\\leq X_j \\\\leq 1, j=1, \\\\dots, n. The ANOVA-like decomposition is :f\\\\left(X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots,X_n\\\\right)=f_0+\\\\sum_{j=1}^nf_j\\\\left(X_j\\\\right)+\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\\\sum_{k=j+1}^n f_{jk}\\\\left(X_j,X_k\\\\right)+ \\\\cdots +f_{12 \\\\dots n} provided that f_0 is a constant and the integral of each term in the sums is zero, i.e. : \\\\int_0^1 f_{j_1 j_2 \\\\dots j_r}\\\\left(X_{j_1},X_{j_2},\\\\dots,X_{j_r}\\\\right)dX_{j_k}=0, \\\\text1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq r. The conditional variance which characterizes the contribution of each term to the total variance of f\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right) is : V_{j_1 j_2 \\\\dots j_r}=\\\\int_0^1 \\\\cdots \\\\int_0^1 f_{j_1 j_2 \\\\dots j_r}^2\\\\left(X_{j_1},X_{j_2},\\\\dots,X_{j_r}\\\\right)dX_{j_1}dX_{j_2}\\\\dots dX_{j_r}. The total variance is the sum of all conditional variances : V = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n V_j + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{k=j+1}^n V_{jk} + \\\\cdots + V_{12\\\\dots n}. The sensitivity index is defined as the normalized conditional variance as : S_{j_1 j_2 \\\\dots j_r} = \\\\frac{V_{j_1 j_2 \\\\dots j_r}}{V} especially the first order sensitivity : S_j=\\\\frac{V_j}{V} which indicates the main effect of the input X_j . = Multiple Fourier series = One way to calculate the ANOVA-like decomposition is based on multiple Fourier series. The function f\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right) in the unit hyper-cube can be extended to a multiply periodic function and the multiple Fourier series expansion is : f\\\\left(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{m_1=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{m_2=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{m_n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} C_{m_1m_2...m_n}\\\\exp\\\\bigl[2\\\\pi i\\\\left( m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + \\\\cdots + m_nX_n \\\\right) \\\\bigr], \\\\text{ for integers }m_1, m_2, \\\\dots, m_n where the Fourier coefficient is : C_{m_1m_2...m_n} = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\cdots \\\\int_0^1 f\\\\left(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\right) \\\\exp\\\\bigl[-2\\\\pi i \\\\left( m_1X_1+m_2X_2+\\\\dots+m_nX_n \\\\right) \\\\bigr]. The ANOVA-like decomposition is : \\\\begin{align} f_0 &= C_{00 \\\\dots 0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_j &= \\\\sum_{m_j eq 0} C_{0 \\\\dots m_j \\\\dots 0} \\\\exp\\\\bigl[2\\\\pi i m_jX_j \\\\bigr] \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{jk} &= \\\\sum_{m_j eq 0} \\\\sum_{m_k eq 0} C_{0 \\\\dots m_j \\\\dots m_k \\\\dots 0} \\\\exp\\\\bigl[2\\\\pi i \\\\left( m_jX_j + m_kX_k \\\\right) \\\\bigr] \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{12 \\\\dots n} &= \\\\sum_{m_1 eq 0} \\\\sum_{m_2 eq 0} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{m_n eq 0} C_{m_1 m_2 \\\\dots m_n} \\\\exp\\\\bigl[ 2\\\\pi i \\\\left( m_1X_1+m_2X_2+\\\\cdots+m_nX_n \\\\right) \\\\bigr]. \\\\end{align} The first order conditional variance is : \\\\begin{align} V_j &= \\\\int_0^1 f_j^2\\\\left(X_j\\\\right)dX_j\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{ m_j eq 0 } \\\\left C_{0 \\\\dots m_j \\\\dots 0} \\\\right^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2\\\\sum_{m_j=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left( A_{m_j}^2+B_{m_j}^2 \\\\right) \\\\end{align} where A_{m_j} and B_{m_j} are the real and imaginary part of C_{0 \\\\dots m_j \\\\dots 0} respectively : A_{m_j} = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\cdots \\\\int_0^1 f \\\\left(X_1, X_2, \\\\dots, X_n\\\\right) \\\\cos\\\\left(2\\\\pi m_jX_j\\\\right)dX_1dX_2 \\\\dots dX_n B_{m_j} = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\cdots \\\\int_0^1 f \\\\left(X_1, X_2, \\\\dots, X_n\\\\right) \\\\sin\\\\left(2\\\\pi m_jX_j\\\\right)dX_1dX_2 \\\\dots dX_n = Ergodic theorem = A multi-dimensional integral must be evaluated in order to calculate the Fourier coefficients. One way to evaluate this multi-dimensional integral is to transform it into a one-dimensional integral by expressing every input as a function of a new independent variable s , as follows : X_j \\\\left( s \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\omega_j s \\\\text{ mod } 2\\\\pi \\\\right), j = 1,2,\\\\dots,n where \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_j\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a set of incommensurate frequencies, i.e. : \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\gamma_j\\\\omega_j = 0 for an integer set of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma_j\\\\right\\\\\\\\} if and only if \\\\gamma_j = 0 for every j . Then the Fourier coefficients can be calculated by a one- dimensional integral according to the ergodic theorem Weyl, H. (1938). Mean motion. American Journal of Mathematics, 60, 889‚Äì896. : A_{m_j} = \\\\lim_{T \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T f\\\\bigl(X_1\\\\left(s\\\\right),X_2\\\\left(s\\\\right),\\\\dots,X_n\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)\\\\cos\\\\bigl(2\\\\pi m_jX_j\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)ds B_{m_j} = \\\\lim_{T \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T f\\\\bigl(X_1\\\\left(s\\\\right),X_2\\\\left(s\\\\right),\\\\dots,X_n\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)\\\\sin\\\\bigl(2\\\\pi m_jX_j\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)ds  Implementation  = Integer frequencies = At most one of the incommensurate frequencies \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_j\\\\right\\\\\\\\} can be rational with all others being irrational. Since the numerical value of an irrational number cannot be stored exactly in a computer, an approximation of the incommensurate frequencies by all rational numbers is required in implementation. Without loss of any generality the frequencies can be set as integers instead of any rational numbers. A set of integers \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_j\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is approximately incommensurate to the order of M if : \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\gamma_j\\\\omega_j eq 0 for : \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\left \\\\gamma_j \\\\right \\\\leq M + 1 where M is an integer. The exact incommensurate condition is an extreme case when M \\\\to \\\\infty . Using the integer frequencies the function in the transformed one-dimensional integral is periodic so only the integration over a period of 2\\\\pi is required. The Fourier coefficients can be approximately calculated as : \\\\begin{align} A_{m_j} &\\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} f\\\\bigl(X_1\\\\left(s\\\\right),X_2\\\\left(s\\\\right),\\\\dots,X_n\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)\\\\cos\\\\left(m_j\\\\omega_j s\\\\right)ds := \\\\hat{A}_{m_j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{m_j} &\\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} f\\\\bigl(X_1\\\\left(s\\\\right),X_2\\\\left(s\\\\right),\\\\dots,X_n\\\\left(s\\\\right)\\\\bigr)\\\\sin\\\\left(m_j\\\\omega_j s\\\\right)ds := \\\\hat{B}_{m_j} \\\\end{align} The approximation of the incommensurate frequencies for a finite M results in a discrepancy error between the true Fourier coefficients A_{m_j} , B_{m_j} and their estimates \\\\hat{A}_{m_j} , \\\\hat{B}_{m_j} . The larger the order M is the smaller the error is but the more computational efforts are required to calculate the estimates in the following procedure. In practice M is frequently set to 4 and a table of resulted frequency sets which have up to 50 frequencies is available. (McRae et al., 1982) = Search curve = The transform, X_j \\\\left( s \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\omega_j s \\\\text{ mod } 2\\\\pi \\\\right), defines a search curve in the input space. If the frequencies, \\\\omega_j, j = 1,\\\\dots,n , are incommensurate, the search curve can pass through every point in the input space as s varies from 0 to \\\\infty so the multi-dimensional integral over the input space can be accurately transformed to a one- dimensional integral along the search curve. However, if the frequencies are approximately incommensurate integers, the search curve cannot pass through every point in the input space. If fact the search is repeated since the transform function is periodic, with a period of 2\\\\pi. The one-dimensional integral can be evaluated over a single period instead of the infinite interval for incommensurate frequencies; However, a computational error arises due to the approximation of the incommensuracy.

Since the frequencies are integers, which are approximately incommensurate, the search curve is repeated and cannot pass through every point on the square = Sampling = The approximated Fourier can be further expressed as : \\\\hat{A}_{m_j}= \\\\begin{cases} 0 & m_j \\\\text{ odd} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\pi/2}^{\\\\pi/2}f\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf X(s)\\\\bigr)\\\\cos\\\\left(m_j\\\\omega_js\\\\right)ds & m_j \\\\text{ even} \\\\end{cases} and : \\\\hat{B}_{m_j}= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\pi/2}^{\\\\pi/2}f\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf X(s)\\\\bigr)\\\\sin\\\\left(m_j\\\\omega_js\\\\right)ds & m_j \\\\text{ odd} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & m_j \\\\text{ even} \\\\end{cases} The non-zero integrals can be calculated from sampling points : \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{A}_{m_j} &= \\\\frac{1}{2q+1}\\\\sum_{k=-q}^q f\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf X(s_k)\\\\bigr)\\\\cos\\\\left( m_j \\\\omega_j s_k\\\\right), m_j \\\\text{ even}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{B}_{m_j} &= \\\\frac{1}{2q+1}\\\\sum_{k=-q}^q f\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf X(s_k)\\\\bigr)\\\\sin\\\\left( m_j \\\\omega_j s_k\\\\right), m_j \\\\text{ odd } \\\\end{align} where the uniform sampling point in \\\\left[-\\\\pi/2, \\\\pi/2\\\\right] is : s_k = \\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{2q+1}, k=-q,\\\\dots,-1,0,1,\\\\dots,q. The total number of sampling points is 2q+1 which should satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion, i.e. : 2q+1 \\\\geq N\\\\omega_{max}+1 where \\\\omega_{max} is the largest frequency in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega_k\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and N is the maximum order of the calculated Fourier coefficients. = Partial sum = After calculating the estimated Fourier coefficients, the first order conditional variance can be approximated by : \\\\begin{align} V_j &= 2\\\\sum_{m_j=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left( A_{m_j}^2+B_{m_j}^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx 2\\\\sum_{m_j=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left( \\\\hat{A}_{m_j}^2+\\\\hat{B}_{m_j}^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx 2\\\\sum_{m_j=1}^{2} \\\\left( \\\\hat{A}_{m_j}^2+\\\\hat{B}_{m_j}^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2\\\\left( \\\\hat{A}_{m_j=2}^2 + \\\\hat{B}_{m_j=1}^2 \\\\right) \\\\end{align} where only the partial sum of the first two terms is calculated and N=2 for determining the number of sampling points. Using the partial sum can usually return an adequately good approximation of the total sum since the terms corresponding to the fundamental frequency and low order frequencies usually contribute most to the total sum. Additionally, the Fourier coefficient in the summation are just an estimate of the true value and adding more higher order terms will not help improve the computational accuracy significantly. Since the integer frequencies are not exactly incommensurate there are two integers m_j and m_k such that m_j\\\\omega_j = m_k\\\\omega_k. Interference between the two frequencies can occur if higher order terms are included in the summation. Similarly the total variance of f\\\\left( \\\\mathbf X \\\\right) can be calculated as : V \\\\approx \\\\hat{A}_0\\\\left[ f^2 \\\\right] - \\\\hat{A}_0\\\\left[ f \\\\right]^2 where \\\\hat{A}_0\\\\left[ f^2 \\\\right] denotes the estimated Fourier coefficient of the function of f^2 inside the bracket and \\\\hat{A}_0\\\\left[ f \\\\right]^2 is the squared Fourier coefficient of the function f . Finally the sensitivity referring to the main effect of an input can be calculated by dividing the conditional variance by the total variance.

The name Baijini According to one view, the word \\"Baijini\\" itself is said to have been derived from a Makassarese root with the meaning \\"women\\", which would fit with the fact that the Baijini of the myths have women among them, unlike the historical Makassan trepang fishermen. Joseph Needham wondered if the word Baijini itself might not have been derived from Chinese b√°i r√©n (ÁôΩ‰∫∫, \\"white people\\" (i.e., those with lighter skin than the Australian natives), bƒõir√©n (Âåó‰∫∫, \\"northern people\\"), or even bƒõijƒ´ngr√©n (Âåó‰∫¨‰∫∫, \\"people from Beijing\\"). The Baijini in Yolngu legend In the Djanggawul song-cycles, it is told how, in the legendary land of Bu'ralgu somewhere beyond Groote Eylandt, there once lived three eternal beings called the Djanggawul: a brother, and his elder and younger sisters, together with a fourth man, Bralbral. Bu'ralgu itself had been a stepping stone in their journey south from an even more distant land. The four, after a series of ceremonies, rowed out from the island and, after several days, came to Arnhem Land, and followed the coast to Jela≈ãbara (now Port Bradshaw. They then travelled overland until they came to Wabilinga Island and it was there that they came across the Baijini folk, cooking trepang at a site still marked by a tamarind grove. The Djanggawu claimed this place as their own, asking the Baijini to move off, which they did, either to the other side of the island or to the mainland. The dreamtime landing site at Jela≈ãbara was, according to the song cycle, also, later, a Baijini settlement. Theories It has been argued that the account of the Baijini in the Aboriginal folklore are in fact a mythological reflection of the experiences of some Aboriginals who have traveled to Sulawesi with the Macassans and came back. If there was indeed an historical reality behind the Baijini mentioned in Yol≈ãu myth, While, the origin and timing of those Asians who would have served as the prototype for this mythological people remains lost in the past. It has been suggested that they may be identified with the Sama-Bajau, or Sea Gypsies, the fishing folk of South East Asia who traveled with their families. The Australian anthropologist Ronald Berndt, an authority on the mythology of the indigenous people of Arnhem Land, undertook intensive work in Yirrkala and Milingimbi Island in the late 1940s. In his work on their mythic traditions, published in 1952 he wrote:- > 'the Baijini, although partially mythological are, rather, historical; for > they are said to have been pre-Macassans, primarily traders and aliens to > the coast, and not in any way creative as were the Djanggawul. They are, > however, treated in the myth as if contemporary with these Ancestral > Beings'. Berndt added that similar to the Makassan trepang fishermen in Australia known to the historians, the Baijini of the Djanggawul myth are said to be \\"cooking trepang, where the tamarind trees stand to-day\\". Tamarind trees are thought to have been introduced to Australia by the Makassans. According to interpretations of the legends, the Baijini not only built stone houses (balapathu) but also cultivated rice paddies. The following year. the sinologist C.P. FitzGerald mentioned the possibility of pre-European Chinese visits to Australia in an article, which conjecture a possible early Chinese presence in northern Australia, by mentioning a Chinese statue which had been dug up in 1879 near Darwin. Baijini and Shou lao Fitzgerald's allusion was a figurine which had been dug up 4 feet down among the roots of a banyan tree by Chinese natives, under the direction of a Public Works superintendent, Mr. Strawbridge, who was overseeing the clearance of dense jungle for the construction of a road at a site called Doctor's Gully in Palmerston just outside of the town of Darwin in 1879. The gully leads down to a sandy cove, and is one of the two sites where fresh water can be found in Darwin. The figurine was mounted on an animal, identified as either a gazelle or antelope. It came into the possession of Thomas Worsnop who reproduced a drawing of it in his 1897 work on Aboriginal arts and manufactures. Worsnop described it as fashioned from a type of jade, though later scholars have stated it is made of soapstone, and stated that all inquiries he had made to determine what it represented had failed to clarify its origin. Eventually, In a paper read before the Royal Society of South Australia on 8 March 1928, Norman Tindale identified it as a Chinese deity from the Tang dynasty, a high backdating which elicited Fitzgerald's skepticism. The deity in question, associated with Canopus, is the Old Man of the South Pole,Sh√≤u l«éo,(Â£ΩËÄÅ), the Chinese god of longevity who was one of the SƒÅnxƒ´ng, or three stellar deities in Chinese religion. Peter Worsley took up Fitzgerald's remark in 1955, making a succinct synthesis of the overall scholarship regarding pre-European contacts with northern Australia. In his essay, he mentioned the Baijini myths current among the Yolgnu: > history. In eastern Arnhem Land, moreover, the aborigines are quite > categorical in their statements that the Macassarese were preceded another > people they term the Baijini. These people were different from the later > Macassarese, though like the Macassarese, they came for the purpose of > collecting trepan, a sea-slug which abounds in the shallow waters off the > Arnhem Land coast.. The Baijini had an advanced technology: they possessed > hand-looms, were agriculturalists, and built huts during their stays in > Australia. One of the more interesting comments made about the Baijini is a > reference to their light-coloured skins. Whilst it is possible that these > people may have been Chinese, the trade in trepang was usually carried out > by non-Chinese, the Chinese middlemen coming into the picture at Koepang and > other such markets. Fitzgerald suggests that any Chinese voyages would most > likely have been scientific and exploratory expeditions rather than trading > expeditions. The Baijini, then, may have been another Indonesian people, and > not necessarily Chinese.' J.V.G. Mills, in a note to a translation of a Ming dynasty account by Ma Huan concerning Chinese voyages at that time, suggested that if, of the many Asian people whose visits might have engendered a legend about the Baijini, they were Chinese, the likely explanation would be that it referred to some vessel detached from the fleet of Zheng He, which would have sailed south from Timor. Modern scholarship Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has interpreted the cycle's mention of the Baijini as a fictional history devised by the Yolngu, centered on Warramiri clanland at Dholtji in the Cape Wilberforce peninsula whose function was to serve as a benchmark for trade with Asians. A key figure was Birrinydji, the iron-maker of the Dreamtime, believed to be the first to inhabit Arnhem Land, perhaps modeled on a foreign captain, who could morph at will from being white to black. Birrinydji's people wore sarongs, distinctive whale-tail shaped hats and their craft flew a flag banded with blue, red and blue stripes. A Macassan story speaks of a group of Gowans sailing south and finding refuge in Arnhem Land after the Macassan Kingdom of Gowa was attacked by a joint Dutch-Bugis force in 1667. But earlier elements, Islamic and Portuguese are also present in the myth cycle: a moon-dwelling deity called 'Allah' alluded to in funerary rites; pre-Macassan men in 'mirrors' (shining armour) rallied troops on Dholtji's shore; Warramiri elders refer to Dholtji as Mecca, etc. The word 'Birrinydji' itself appears to reflect a term for freebooting Portuguese crusaders. Beneath these reflexes in myth of pre-modern contact with South Asian traders, the Baijini represent an older pre-Macassan order. One index of this is that Dholtji songs fail to mention precisely what the Macassan traders sought, trepang. The Birrinydji cycle speaks of a tall bearded people with a king, Luki, the admiral of Birrinydji's fleet Lela and his boat's captain Djammangi. Whatever the historical reality, McIntosh concluded, functionally in these Yolgnu traditions, the contrast between a golden age of wealth, reciprocity and law-giving, and a subsequent period of seafaring Macassan trepang hunters, functions as two distinct realms, the sacred and profane, of thinking about their world, and as a metaphoric idiom for negotiating forms of reconciliation between their traditional order and the modern world of the whites who seek access to Arnhem Land resources.

Anderson and Donald R. Leal that was of great importance to the free market environmentalist movement. It was intended as an ideological tract and call to action, rather than as an empirical study. The book was lauded for its readability and its reference list was described as \\"one of the most comprehensive offerings currently available in this area.\\" It was praised for presenting the possibility of replacing zero-sum contests between industry and conservationists with markets that would allow for mutually acceptable arrangements. However, it was also criticized as having a narrow assessment of environmental values and various policy options, and not weighing historical facts carefully. It was also criticized for not presenting a very persuasive argument for tradeable permits, inasmuch as only one significant example of their application to water quality, and that a not very successful one, was cited. Likewise, the book was criticized for not explaining how liability rules would work when pollutants are pervasive and synergistic. The book provides a refreshing alternative to protecting the environment and natural resources that does not include more bureaucracy. The intuition is that free markets have been making the environment cleaner for centuries. Cars were becoming more eco-friendly long before the government passed any legislation like the Clean Air Act, and they would continue to get better without more regulation. Anderson provides case study after case study where juries recognize that a company is harming a private individual and grants reparations to the harmed party. The argument for property rights over regulation is a compelling one, because while the former is resolved through a direct transfer of payments from the polluter to the harmed, the latter is typically just a tax blanket tax on carbon emissions that winds up in the federal coffers.

Overview  The Compact File Set (CFS) is an open archive file format and software distribution container file format. Basic CFS files are compatible with ISO files. It is intended to be similar enough to ISO-9660 that many systems and applications will be able to read CFS, and other applications will require only minor modifications. It is based on: * ISO-9660 * Joliet (file system) * ISO-9660:1999 * Compact ISO It is available for use in free or commercial applications without charge. It is supposed that no parts of the format are covered by patents. The primary application is expected to be container files for various archiving and distribution applications, but CFS may be useful when written directly to CD/DVD media. = Goals = * Simplify use with data compression and with non seeking storage (pipes, sockets, tape). * Simplify implementation of read and write applications compared to traditional ISO-9660/UDF based images. * Improved consistency and interchange of data between different applications. * Simplify implementation of applications that modify images. * Increase storage efficiency by using less image space for media structures and duplicated directory data. * Eliminate the folder count limitation imposed in ISO-9660 by the path table. * Eliminate the file size limitations imposed by various compatibility restrictions with use of ISO-9660 and UDF. = Main differences of CFS from ISO-9660 = * The layout and contents of the media header (first 40k) is fixed, always containing the same sequence of volume structures and data. * All file names and text fields are stored as big-endian UCS-2, as specified in the Joliet extensions. * Arbitrary limitations on file name and directory depth are removed, up to the limitations of the ISO-9660 file record structure, 110 16 bit characters. * All directory data is written after the last block of file data. * Readers are expected to handle files over 4GB in size. * Path tables are optionally generated but are not used.  Technical Information  = Media header = The first 20 blocks (40K) of the logical image is the media header. The layout of the media header is compatible with the various descriptor and directory structures for ISO-9660. The first block of file data is stored in block 20, immediately following the media header. The media header has the following layout: > ; block 0-11 : all zero ; block 12 : compatibility readme file text ; block > 13 : compatibility root folder ; block 14 : compatibility little-endian path > table ; block 15 : compatibility big-endian path table ; block 16 : ISO-9660 > compatibility primary volume descriptor ; block 17 : ISO-9660 supplementary > volume descriptor ; block 18 : ISO-9660 terminating descriptor ; block 19 : > all zero The primary volume descriptor in the media header references the fixed compatibility root folder and readme, to help users identify applications and systems that do not use the supplementary volume descriptor. The supplementary volume descriptor indicates the UCS-2 character set and references the real directory structure. The media header should be initialized exactly as is done in the logic in this header file. No additional application data, system data, comments, dates, text, etc., should be added to the media header. = Unicode file names = All file names and the system ID and volume ID fields of the supplementary volume descriptor are encoded as UCS-2, big-endian. File name lengths are limited by the 8 bit file record size to 110 16 bit characters. No arbitrary limits are imposed on directory hierarchy depth or combined length of a file name and included folder name components. Readers will need to choose an appropriate limit for their environment and perform checks as necessary. As in ISO-9660-1999, version numbers are not added to file names. As in ISO-9660-1999, special meaning of the '.' and ';' characters during file name sorting is eliminated. = Optional path tables = Path tables consume media space with redundant information, and restrict media to a maximum of 64k folders. Readers should not reference path tables. Writers may choose to generate path tables to increase compatibility with ISO-9660 readers. Path tables must be written with the directory data (folder extents), beyond the last block of file data. Note that correct path tables cannot be generated for media containing more than 64K folders. Writers that are modifying an existing media may choose to remove existing path tables. If path tables are not present then the three related volume descriptor fields in the supplementary volume descriptor must be set to zero. = Extended attributes = Extended attributes are reserved for future extensions to CFS. Writers must not create extended attributes. Readers must gracefully handle extended attributes if they exist. File data must be contiguous, and restricted use of duplicate file records for multi-extent files. All data for each file must exist in one contiguous extent. This is true even when the files are represented using multiple file records. Interleaved files must not be created. Associated files must not be created. Duplicate file records are to be used only to allow representing files with data extents that are larger than 4GiB-2048. Duplicate file records are not to be used to represent files with fragmented data. When duplicate file records are used, the multi-extent flag must also be used as indicated in ISO-9660-1999 specification. Duplicate file records should not be created unless the total data size of the file is greater than 4Gib-2048. When duplicate file records exist for a file, all but the last file record must have a data extent that is exactly 4Gib-2048 bytes in size. = Location of directory data on media = All file data must precede all folder extents and path tables on media. The intent is that an image modifying application can read the entire directory into memory, add new file data to the image, and rewrite an updated directory after the new file data. Writers will need to determine the last block of file data after reading the entire directory. = Media header patch area = When the media header is modified, either at the end of image creation or as part of later modifications to an existing image, only some specific fields are to be updated. These fields exist entirely within the media header patch area. Only the media header patch area should be re-written. This allows more options when dealing with image container file formats or transports with limited seeking or overwrite capability (compressed formats, pipes, sockets). = Format extensions and compound file systems = All files and folders written in the image must be accessible through the single directory structure referenced from the supplementary volume descriptor. Compound file systems, such as including UDF or HFS structures, are not allowed. Rockridge and other ISO-9660 extensions are not allowed. = Extensions for archiving system specific attributes = Future versions of CFS may include extensions to allow storing system specific attributes such as time fields, security descriptors, access control lists, resource forks, symbolic links etc.. Developers with a need for these extensions should contact Pismo Technic with requirements and/or suggestions. = Media formats= CFS images are either written to CD/DVD media, or are stored in a media container file. The media container file can be a raw dump of the CFS image, referred to here as DD, but more commonly known as ISO files. Also, the media container file can be a more structured container format that provides additional features such as compression and spanning. CFS images are only compliant with this specification when they are stored in DD or CISO (Compact ISO) format media files. When burned to CD/DVD media or when stored in other media container file formats such as NRG or DAA, the combination is not CFS compliant and should not be referred to as a CFS file. Note: Compact ISO is not the same format as the compressed ISO format common in PlayStation Portable homebrew development. The PSP compressed ISO format is also referred to as CISO, but the file extension is CSO. CFS writing applications should default to writing DD format media container files unless the user has specified container file options that require CISO (spanning, compression, ...). This provides more intuitive interchange with systems and applications that support DD CD/DVD images but do not support CFS.

Its plot is based on the 1973 Michigan PBB contamination incident. Plot Ned De Vries (played by Ron Howard) is a Michigan dairy farmer, a young ambitious man with a wife and family, but he has a problem. His cattle are getting sick. De Vries calls the local veterinary authorities from the Michigan Farm Bureau who study his animals, take samples, and kill a small ailing calf to take the remains for autopsy. Judging from the results, they claim he is responsible for his problem. De Vries claims to have been feeding his livestock only on the recommended protein-enriched feeds, commonly marketed across the state by Michigan Farm Bureau Services. After scouring his pastures for signs of contaminants and studying his livestock to try to explain their symptoms, De Vries thinks he has made a breakthrough when he finds a nest of dead rats, and his own brief examination shows they all had symptoms similar to his cattle. The nest, like the rats, is full of cattle feed. When he presents his findings to the Bureau veterinarians, they pay no regard to his claims or fears that the feed might be poisoned. They choose to ignore him, leaving him frustrated in his search for an answer. Indeed his first thoughts that the rats would be part of the solution are now dashed, because naturally his family do not eat cattle feed, and they too are showing signs of skin complaints, headaches and feeling generally unwell. Now dispirited and desperate, Ned De Vries makes an impassioned plea to one of the Bureau‚Äôs lab technicians who wrote the report on his livestock. After some urging the man provides information that may help. The farm samples were tested by gas chromatography, the tests being run for several hours. By mistake, one of the tests was allowed to run all night long. Toward the end of this long print-out a single un-identified blip appeared on the result chart, showing an un-known substance in the calf‚Äôs tissues. Unable to help further, the technician gives De Vries the charts and points him in the direction of Dr. Morton Freeman ( Richard Dysart ), a respected scientist and researcher. Dr. Freeman responds to De Vries' request for help and identifies the blip on the chart as Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a flame retardant used in Firemaster extinguishers. At last the answer is in his hands. De Vries is surprised to find Dr. Freeman visiting him the following morning, but the doctor has been doing further research into PBBs. Exposure symptoms match what they already know, and include memory loss and possible cancer. They find that the substance that has poisoned his livestock can be passed on to humans by eating beef and drinking milk. This is clearly shown by his family's poor health. His wife can no longer breast feed her baby, as that too would pass on any PBB she has in her body. The substance is stored in body fat and is cumulative. It's firmly in the food chain, and the long-term effects are uncertain, as there is no known way to remove PBB once it has been ingested. After being met with scepticism for so long, De Vries finds he is now bogged down in bureaucratic inertia, even with the support of Dr. Freeman and his findings. He travels the state in his spare time, gathering all the information he can about the spread of the contaminant. He finds another farmer like himself, dispirited and without hope after a long struggle with the Farming Bureau and official policy. He too has lost cattle and his family is also in poor health; and he has carried the burden of guilt that he is somehow directly responsible for all that has happened to him. The source of the contamination is revealed as the film draws to its close. In the Farm Bureau Services mill near Battle Creek, Michigan, the proteins that are added to animal feed, and the chemicals (PBB) used in fire retardant, are being stored in identical coloured paper sacks, on pallets placed side by side. No-one can tell at a glance which is which, and it becomes evident that they could easily have been switched in error. The film concludes a year after the initial outbreak, with the killing of Ned De Vries‚Äô entire herd, as the animals are led into a deep open pit, shot, and bulldozed over with soil.

He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Battersea South in London from 1931 to 1945. Career Selley was born in Topsham, Devon, and became a builder's apprentice. He rose to run his own business, and estimated that he had been responsible for the building of more than 25,000 houses in London and its suburbs. Selley stood unsuccessfully in the 1919 London County Council election in Balham and Tooting.London Municipal Notes - Volumes 18-23, London Municipal Society In 1925, he was elected to the council as a member of the majority Municipal Reform Party, representing Battersea South. He was appointed chairman of the council's Housing Committee and of the Hospitals Planning and Development Sub- Committee. He was re-elected to the council in 1928, 1931 and 1934. In the latter year the Municipal Reformers, who were allied to the parliamentary Conservative Party, lost control to the Labour Party. He retired from the council at the 1937 elections. Selley first stood for Parliament at the Battersea South by-election in February 1929, when he lost by 2.1% of the votes to the Labour Party candidate, William Bennett. He contested the seat again at the general election in May 1929, cutting Bennett's majority to only 1.1%, and at the 1931 general election he defeated Bennett with a majority 36.2%. He was re-elected in 1935, and held the seat until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1945 general election. He was knighted in 1944. In May 1945, aged 73, he won a bet with housing minister George Hicks by building a four-course wall of 200 bricks in the Commons Courtyard at the Houses of Parliament in less than an hour, whilst wearing a bowler hat. His intention was to demonstrate his belief that the Ministry of Works's target for bricklayers to lay between 200 and 300 bricks per day was inadequate, and after completing the wall he pronounced that 800 was a more reasonable target. An editorial in The Times praised the achievement as \\"one to warm the heart with admiration\\". He was national president of Federation of Master Builders from 1945 to at least 1951, when he celebrated his 80th birthday by laying the 80th brick in a wall built in his honour at the Connaught Rooms. Family Selley was married in 1896 to Eleanor Kate Westcott, daughter of Thomas Westcott. They had a son and a daughter, and after her death in 1935 he got married again, in 1939, to Margaret Avelyn (Sheila), the widow of Joseph Hendrick. After his death in 1960, at the age of 88, his estate was valued at ¬£63,204.

The current format of the IPPT was adapted from the National Physical Fitness Assessment (NAPFA) test protocol developed by the Singapore Sports Council in 1980‚Äì81 and was launched in 1982. Its standards were derived from a NAPFA study, in which the results were scientifically compiled and calibrated to fairly address the various physical fitness abilities of different age groups. Prior to 2015, the IPPT consisted of five stations: sit-up, standing broad jump, chin-up, 4 x 10 metres shuttle run and 2.4 kilometres run. On 1 April 2011, the Enhanced NS IPPT system for NSmen was implemented, incorporating principles of physical training science to enable servicemen to train more effectively and giving them greater flexibility in managing their training schedules. In late 2013, Singapore's Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) announced that it is considering implementing key changes to the IPPT system to put it in line with the fitness tests used in the Australian and United States armed forces. Some of these changes include: removing the standing broad jump station; adding push-up as a test criterion; extending the distance of the current 2.4 kilometres run to 3.2 kilometres. On 23 July 2014, Ng Eng Hen, Singapore's Defence Minister, mentioned in a post on Facebook that the IPPT will be reduced from five stations to three: The standing broad jump, chin-up, and 4 x 10 metres shuttle run stations will be removed ‚Äì with the sit-up station and 2.4 kilometres run kept intact ‚Äì and a new station, push-up, will be added. The details of the scoring system of the new IPPT were announced by MINDEF on 24 July. Under this new scoring system, a person has to accumulate a minimum total number of points from all three stations to pass or qualify for the Gold, Silver or Pass with Incentive standard. The updated IPPT format was rolled out in 2015. Application The IPPT is applicable to all NSFs, NSmen and regulars who hold the Physical Employment Status (PES) of A, B/B1 or B2/C1. All IPPT- eligible servicemen and servicewomen are assigned IPPT windows based on their birthdays. The window opens on his/her birthday and closes on the day before his/her next birthday. The IPPT Standards and Scoring System is based on the person's age, sex and vocation. IPPT-eligible persons are grouped based on their birthdays into six different age categories (X, Y, Y1, Z, Z1, Z2/V) ranging from below 25 years old to 49 years old. There are four IPPT vocation groupings: Commandos/Divers; Guards; Combat; Service. The Scoring System awards grades and points to the raw scores obtained by the person at each of the five test stations. The person is required to obtain a minimum grade for each station and accumulate a minimum total number of points for all stations in order to pass the IPPT. Based on his/her score, the person may be awarded the Gold, Silver or Pass standard, and he/she may receive a monetary incentive accordingly. =NSFs and regulars= NSFs and regulars are required to attempt the IPPT at least once in every IPPT window which follows the 31 March/ 1 April work year. For certain vocations, such as Commandos and Divers, personnel are required to obtain the Gold standard in the IPPT. To qualify for admission to the Officer Cadet School or Specialist Cadet School, recruits undergoing Basic Military Training have to obtain either a Gold or Silver standard in the IPPT before they pass out ‚Äì in addition to fulfilling other requirements. =NSmen= For a NSman, his IPPT annual requirement commences on his birthday immediately after his Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends when he is posted to the MINDEF Reserves or when he is medically downgraded to PES C2 or below. Before the scheme update on 1 September 2014, NSmen had to attempt the IPPT at least once within the first nine months of every IPPT window. The IPPT may be taken either during their annual In-Camp Training (ICT) or other times. In the former case, the IPPT is usually conducted during every ICT so NSmen have to take it unless they are exempted. In the latter case, the IPPT is conducted at various test centres around Singapore and NSmen are allowed to make as many attempts as they wish, provided that they have not already obtained the Gold standard. Besides, the NSman receives pay for only the first three attempts, which are also considered towards his NS liability. Based on the former IPPT Gazette under the Enlistment Act (dated 26 May 2006), any NSman who did not attempt or did not pass the IPPT within the first nine months of his IPPT window had to attend and complete a series of 20 Remedial Training (RT) sessions within the last three months of his IPPT window at any Singapore Armed Forces Fitness and Conditioning Centre (SAF FCC). Before the scheme update NSmen are also allowed to attend a voluntary IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) scheme consisting of 10 sessions within the first nine months of the IPPT window. Under the initial version of the scheme, they must meet certain Personal Performance Targets (PPTs), similar to the IPPT Standards, on the 10th session in order to be exempted from RT. If they did not complete all 10 sessions, they had to attend and complete the 20 sessions of RT in the last three months of their IPPT window. If they completed all 10 IPT sessions but did not meet the PPTs, they had to attend eight sessions of RT instead.The IPT scheme has since been further updated so that NSmen only need to completed 10 session to clear their IPPT window for the year regardless of whether they met their PPTs or not and if they failed to meet their PPTs they do not need to attend additional sessions of RT.https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt-ipt-rt Since 30 May 2011, all IPPT-eligible NSmen 35 years of age and above are required to undergo a compulsory medical examination, called \\"IPPT-FFI\\", every year to ensure that they are medically fit to take the IPPT. Starting from 1 September 2014, NSmen are allowed to attempt and pass the IPPT in one full window (instead of within the first nine months of the window), and complete IPT or RT within the same window (instead of within the last three months of the window). The monetary incentives for achieving Gold, Silver and Pass with Incentive standards are also increased. Disciplinary actions may be subjected to IPPT defaulters in addition to the attendance of 20 session of RT in their next window unless they pass IPPT earlier.https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt-ipt- rt/ippt/overview-ippt/failing-defaulting-ippt In the case of defaulting on RT the penalty is heavier and all 20 session of RT must be completed in the next window.https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt-ipt- rt/rt/guidelines-rt/not-completing-defaulting-rt IPPT Badge The IPPT Badge is awarded to personnel in the SAF and SCDF who have obtained a Gold or Silver standard in the IPPT. It comes in the form of a badge or a pin to be attached to the left sleeve of the person's uniform. The badge or pin is in the shape of a stick figure in a running pose enclosed in a circle. The Gold standard achiever's badge has a star beside the stick figure while the Silver one does not. The SCDF version has a Silver or Gold background to a running stick figure. SPF personnel are not awarded and do not wear the IPPT badge.

Set in the world of haute couture, the film was squarely aimed at female audiences. Its storyline of an established master of her craft being usurped by a younger, ruthlessly ambitious underling, who then years later finds the same thing happening to her - with a waspish male critic on hand throughout to provide a steady stream of acerbic, biting commentary - led inevitably to the film being dubbed the All About Eve of the fashion world. It Started in Paradise was shot in Technicolor and is described by Hal Erickson of Allmovie as: \\"an unusually plush, Lana Turner-esque production to come from a British studio in the early 1950s\\". Plot In 1938, Mme. Alice (Hunt), chief designer of a famous London fashion house, has lost her touch. Where once she was the most sought after designer in the city, now her creations seem locked in the past and clients are looking elsewhere for modern fashions. She is persuaded by her senior assistant Martha (Hylton) that she needs a long holiday to recapture her creative inspiration. Once Mme. Alice has departed the fiercely ambitious Martha, who has been biding her time for several years, launches a coup, designing and presenting a range of up-to-the-minute garments which are a huge success with the fashion media and bring clients flocking back to the salon. The financial backer of the business is delighted with the upturn in profits; Martha is promoted to chief designer and Mme. Alice is quietly retired. Over the course of the next decade Martha, with the help of Alison (Pavlow), a talented girl she took on straight out of school, restores the house to its pre-eminent position in the London fashion world. She becomes so driven that she starts not to care who she treads on in her quest to be the best in the business. Over the years while her professional career goes from strength to strength, she neglects friends, treats associates badly and makes business enemies. By the start of the 1950s Martha too seems to have had her day; appreciation for her designs tapers off and her reputation falls. Those she has alienated on the way up are only too happy to watch her on the way down. Meanwhile, Alison, having waited for her own chance, seizes the opportunity to present her own designs which are acclaimed as fresh, innovative and contemporary. Alison is in, Martha is out, and the cycle begins again. Cast * Jane Hylton as Martha Watkins * Martita Hunt as Mme.

Its world is the world of Haute Couture. It has probably got most of the details right and very admirable are some of the Technicolor backgrounds, but that is the most that can be said in its favour\\". The New York Times was also less than enthusiastic, drawing comparisons with the earlier British fashion picture Maytime in Mayfair and commenting that British films about haute couture: \\"have a tendency to run somewhat to froth\\". It concluded: \\"Well, let's be gentlemanly about it. Maybe there are those who can find some sort of excitement in the kind of lather worked up in this film\\". It did, however, comment that Ronald Squire had a few good lines and the visual portrayal of the dress salon was well defined. Guide to British Cinema in 2003 described it as starting strongly, but with a disappointing climax.

Although she appeared in operas internationally, her career was mainly centered at the Oper Frankfurt where she was a resident artist from 1907-1935. She excelled in the dramatic soprano repertoire, drawing particular acclaim for her portrayal of Wagnerian heroines. She was also an exponent of the works of contemporary composers. Her career was cut short in 1935 due to political pressures and prejudice exerted against her for being married to a Jewish man. She made recordings with Gramophone & Typewriter Ltd., His Master's Voice, and Polydor Records. Life and career Born Else Fischer in Frankfurt am Main, Gentner-Fischer was the daughter of a barber. She studied singing at the Hoch Conservatory before making her professional opera debut in 1905 at the National Theatre Mannheim. That same year she married tenor Karl Gentner, to whom she was later widowed in 1922. She later married baritone Benno Ziegler. In 1906, she and her first husband both joined the roster of singers at the Oper Frankfurt through the invitation of Emil Claar. She made her first appearance at that house in early 1907, and remained committed to that opera house until her retirement from the stage in 1935. Outside of Frankfurt, she appeared as a guest artist at the Berlin State Opera, the Liceu, the Teatro Col√≥n, and the Teatro Real. She toured the United States in 1923-1924 with the German Opera Company and also toured with the Oper Frankfurt to the Netherlands in 1934. In her early career, Gentner-Fischer sang only smaller parts, but by 1910 she was performing leading roles in the soubrette and lyric soprano repertoire. She notably portrayed the role of Sophie in the Frankfurt premiere of Der Rosenkavalier in 1911. In 1914, she was one of the flower maidens in the Frankfurt premiere of Parsifal. She soon moved into heavier repertoire, excelling in parts like Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro, Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, the Empress in Die Frau ohne Schatten, the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier, Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, and the title roles in Aida, Carmen, and Tosca. As her career progressed, Wagnerian heroines increasingly became a more important part of her repertoire; including Br√ºnnhilde in The Ring Cycle, Elsa in Lohengrin, and Isolde in Tristan und Isolde. In addition to performing works from the standard soprano repertoire, Gentner-Fischer also appeared in many productions by modern composers. In Frankfurt she notably created roles in the world premieres of Hermann Wolfgang von Waltershausen's Oberst Chabert (1912, the Countess), Franz Schreker's Die Gezeichneten (1918, Carlotta Nardi), Ernst Krenek's Der Sprung √ºber den Schatten (1924), and Arnold Schoenberg's Von heute auf morgen (1930, the Wife). In 1923 she performed the role of Myrtocle in the United States premiere of Eugen d'Albert's Die toten Augen at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago. In 1929 she sang the role of Emilia Marty in the German premiere of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's The Makropulos Case. On 23 June 1935, Gentner-Fischer gave her final opera performance in the role of Isolde in Frankfurt. Her career was cut short due to prejudice against her husband who was of Jewish descent. In 1939, Ziegler fled Germany for England, leaving Gentner-Fischer behind. She suffered under the political conditions in her country during World War II and lived the remaining years of her life in seclusion in Upper Bavaria. She died in Prien am Chiemsee in 1943 at the age of 59. She is buried in the Frankfurt Main Cemetery.

She became the first woman to lead mixed-gender Muslim prayers in Canada, in 2005. Raza termed it a \\"silent revolution\\" and said she hopes to become an imam someday. She also dreams of having a mosque \\"for women by women\\". She received death threats following the 2005 prayer event. After female imam Amina Wadud received death threats for leading mixed-gender prayers in New York City, Raza was invited by Taj Hargey in 2008 to go to Oxford and become the first Muslim-born woman to lead a mixed-gender British congregation in Friday prayers. According to Muslim reformist Tahir Aslam Gora, such prayers did not become a regular practice. The Canadian Islamic Congress said Raza's concerns were a \\"non-issue for Canadian Muslims\\". =Opposition to prayers in schools= Raza opposed congregational Muslim Friday prayers in public schools, saying that in 1988 the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the use of the Lord's Prayer in public schools was not appropriate. She said such prayers are contrary to the notion of separation of church and state.

In a Fox News interview with Bill O'Reilly she referred to Mayor Michael Bloomberg as having a \\"bleeding heart\\" for this cause that is actually dangerous for those who were affected by the 9/11 terror attacks, as the location of the Ground Zero Mosque seemed unnecessary and hurtful for the victims of the attacks. = On immigration= Raza has called the Canadian government to suspend all immigration from \\"terror-producing\\" countries, like Iran in 2012. =Organizations= Raza is a board member of and Director of Interfaith Affairs for the Muslim Canadian Congress.

He had spent a considerable part of his life being a missionary in Fiji. Rev Lelean served in Fiji for 36 years. History of the Leleans For many years the Lelean family believed that their name was French and that their ancestor could have been a Huguenot who fled France following the St Bartholomew's Day massacre. Research carried out in the 1960s by Leonard Lelean and Ronald Lelean Sharman however suggests that the name is much older than the time of the Huguenots, and may well derive from a Cornish place-name, Leighlean, meaning 'a flat, muddy place. Other variants of the name are Lalean, Le Lean and Le Lane. Rev Charles Lelean's great-great-great-grandfather, James Lelean was a contemporary of the great English evangelist, John Wesley. Rev Wesley had referred to Mr James Lelean as the kind farmer who showed him kindness amongst a hostile mob when he visited Mevagissey, Cornwall in 1753. John Wesley then presented James Lelean and his wife Mary with his silver buckles in thanks. The buckles are now in the Wesley Museum, City Road, London. The http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sterth/wills1777_81.htm Cornish Will Abstracts of 1777 - 1781] however records James Lelean as a fisherman of Mevagissey. C.O Lelean's grandfather, John moved to Australia in the 1800s. The Leleans in Fiji Rev C.O Lelean married Edith Annie Shoebridge in April 1897 in Bushy Park, Tasmania, daughter of William Ebenezer Shoebridge and Anne Benson Mather. They had one daughter, Ella Lelean. Edith Lelean died in Fiji on 15 May 1906. The early Methodist missions in Fiji served as education centres where students were taught to read and write as well as a rudimentary knowledge of medicine. This laid the foundations of formal education in Fiji. Fijian Methodist Ministers and Catechists were not only instrumental in spreading the Christian Gospel, but were also very effective in showing Fijians the benefits of literacy and proper hygiene. Rev C.O Lelean spent twenty years of his service in Fiji as Senior Superintendent of the Davuilevu Mission and principal of the Methodist Theological College from 1914 to 1934. He succeeded Reverend William Bennett as principal of the Fiji Methodist Theological College which was moved from Navuloa to Davuilevu in 1907. Charles Lelean's nephew, Rev Arthur D. Lelean, worked as a missionary in Fiji from 1918 to 1936. Lelean Memorial School When, due to the military needs of the Pacific Campaign of the Second World War, a school for boys was moved from the Toorak Boys School in Suva and established in 1943 at the Davuilevu, Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma compound by Mr William Earnest Donnelly of New Zealand, the Davuilevu Council instructed Donnelly to name it the Lelean Memorial School after Reverend Charles Oswald Lelean. Rev C.O Lelean had impacted numerous lives and generations of Fijians through his long and dedicated service and was a much loved minister.

NYU Press) To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice is a 1998 book by Bruce L. Benson about private policing, private prosecution, and other market-based methods of providing criminal justice. Benson traces the history of government's escalating involvement in criminal justice over the past centuries in the United Kingdom and in the United States, and argues that it has resulted in overpriced, low- quality service that does not adequately address the needs of communities and crime victims. He argues for parole bonds, restorative justice, shifting toward a criminal justice system that resembles the civil tort system, and other reforms. Reception =Praise= The book was praised for its \\"trove of compelling observations, anecdotes, and conjectures,\\" for its \\"nearly encyclopedic\\" coverage of private techniques in criminal justice, and for elevating the discussion of criminal justice to a higher philosophical plane by redirecting the reader's attention away from social engineering goals like deterrence and rehabilitation toward a focus on justice and individual rights and responsibilities. It was praised for its summary of the role of private contributions to the criminal justice system, such as witness testimony and the bail bondsman system. It was also praised for applying economics, including incentives analysis, to the study of law. =Criticism= The book is written in a 'dogmatic' style, as one reviewer notes, \\"His writing is heavy going in places, drifting off into Ayn Rand-like pronouncements. John Galt might have written much of Chapter 10, for example. Still, the reader who stays the course will learn a great deal from this book.\\" The book was criticized for being profoundly dogmatic rather than scholarly and open- minded, assuming that government inefficiencies and scandals are inevitable, downplaying the potential for private firms to commit some of the same abuses that the government commits, painting an overly positive picture of vigilantism, presenting conjecture and assertion as fact, failing to address the disparity between anti-crime resource expenditures directed toward the poor and the rich, promoting potentially divisive gated communities and private streets, falsely stating that researcher Philip J. Cook had found that gun controls tend to increase crime, and saying too little about the problem of determining optimal restitution amounts in cases of homicide, rape, and other violent crimes and in cases of obstruction of justice. One critic wrote, \\"To Serve and Protect draws cartoon images: the market is a resourceful Roadrunner, who at every turn defeats a Wile E. Coyote government capable only of colossally complicated and corrupt schemes that are doomed inevitably to fail.\\" The book was also criticized for sometimes failing to use the latest data available, for being too quick to attribute facts to the statist nature of the justice system rather than to rent-seeking by lawyers, for being silent on the role of faith-based and other voluntary, nonprofit entities in a privatized system, for ignoring the impact that full restitution could have on investment in private defense against crime, and for its dull prose. It was also criticized for not adequately addressing criticism of private prisons and of firms such as the Pinkerton Detective Agency.

Season summary The sacking of long-serving and highly successful manager George Graham following a bungs scandal saw Arsenal endure their most frustrating season in 10 years. They finished 12th in the Premier League - below unfancied London rivals Queens Park Rangers and Wimbledon - and also had to endure the loss of Paul Merson for three months while he underwent treatment to combat drug and gambling addictions. Graham's assistant Stewart Houston took over as manager until the end of the season, and the changeover coincided with a horrible run of 6 defeats in 7 games, leaving Arsenal in serious danger of being relegated just four years after winning the title and two years after their domestic cup double. Fortunately the team rallied in the final weeks and took 8 points from their final 5 games, securing their Premier League spot. The FA Cup only added to the frustration, as they were embarrassingly knocked out at the first hurdle by London rivals Millwall, though they at least had a comparatively decent League Cup run, losing in the fifth round to eventual winners Liverpool. Despite their domestic troubles, the team reached the European Cup Winners' Cup final for the second year in succession. With 120 minutes showing on the clock in Paris, a penalty shoot-out was looking certain as Arsenal were drawing 1‚Äì1 with Real Zaragoza. But a last minute goal by former Tottenham Hotspur player Nayim from 40 yards out saw the Gunners lose defence of the trophy and it went to the Spaniards instead.

History According to an article published in the Daily Oil, the market suspected that company owner Henry Rosenberg was preparing to sell the company. The refinery reported a loss of 829.4 million dollars in 1998, partially due to a union boycott. Rosenberg was also facing credit issues. An August 2000 document from the Golnoy Barge Company showed $66.6 million in net sales (EBITDALL) in the first six months of 2000 and $5.6 million net income in the first half of 2000, compared to a loss of $22 million a year earlier. This document also stated that \\"anyone who wanted to purchase the Central Crown in 2000 should be prepared to refinance the debt of $125 million.\\" In 2003, this debt had risen to $200 million. Members felt that in 2000 these values could be $83 million higher than what was officially reported. The refinery had a capacity to store more than 6 million barrels, so the value of these stocks could even exceed $1 billion. In November 2005, Petrobras signed an MoU with Astra Oil Company with the goal of establishing a joint operation of refining and marketing in the US. The acquisition was completed in September 2006. The total amount paid was $360 million: $190 million for 50% of the shares and $170 million for the refinery stocks. Disagreements among the partners led to Astra requesting the right to sell its remaining 50% to Petrobras. This right only existed because the Brazilian state had the final say about the direction and future investments in the refinery. If the Astra did not agree, they would have the option to sell and Petrobras would have the option to buy. An arbitration confirmed this right in April 2009 and set the value of the second half of the refinery at $296 million, plus $170 million for its share of the stock, totaling U.S. $466 million. This amount was supplemented by an additional $173 million corresponding to a refund of part of a bank guarantee by partners, interest, fees and court costs. The total arbitration value was $639 million. On March 10, 2010, the Federal Court in Houston, Texas, USA, confirmed the judgment, finding that PAI would be the holder of the Pasadena refinery and trading company.US Court reassert the decision about Pasadena Refinery In June 2012, an extrajudicial agreement that provided for the termination of arbitration and other lawsuits, plus interest and legal costs, totaled $820 million. Part of this amount, $750 million, had already been accrued for payment in the financial statements of Petrobras, leaving the additional provision of $70 million to be recognized in the income statement in the second quarter of 2012. Petrobras acquired the Pasadena refinery as well as Astra Trading, the commercial arm of the refinery. The debt inherited in the acquisition is unknown. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. announced on May 1, 2019, that it that it had acquired from Petrobras America Inc. all the outstanding shares and equity interests of Pasadena Refining System, Inc.

Despite the \\"Saints\\" holding Shrewsbury Town to a 2‚Äì2 draw, Clarke was replaced by John Page for the next match. The form of Wilkins and then Ron Davies at right-back restricted Clarke to two further first-team appearances, against Colchester United on 1 May 1958 and at Rochdale on 4 April 1959. He was released in the summer of 1959 into non- league football.

It originally debuted on December 28, 2008 in the Comic Market 75 d≈çjin convention. The official DVD version first released on December 31, 2009 in a limited first edition and special limited edition. The OVA was adapted into a 34-minute film by Actas, released on September 9, 2010, which uses the original cast. The movie also includes a 7-minute, 30 second side story not present in the original anime.  Plot  Kowarekake no Orgel begins in medias res with a look at the two main characters, Keiichir≈ç and Flower, sitting in a van in the rain. It then flashes back to the beginning, showing Keiichir≈ç taking shelter from the rain near a trash heap next to which a small girl is sitting in a chair with a sunflower, unconscious. After second thoughts he decides to pick her up and takes her to a technical specialist. The scene reveals that the girl is an older model of a popular line of service androids, called Parents, who is broken. Because she is an older model, the specialist says she cannot be fixed, and provides Keiichir≈ç with the necessary sticker to dispose of her. Keiichir≈ç leaves her among some junk in his house before going to sleep, intending to throw her out the following day. During the night, the girl begins functioning and finds herself in a strange house with no memory of the past. When Keiichir≈ç comes downstairs the following morning, he finds her preparing breakfast. He names her Flower after the sunflower she was holding when he found her. It is revealed that evening, when Flower prepares the same meal for dinner as she had for breakfast, that Flower suffers from short-term memory loss, so Keiichir≈ç buys her a diary which is used as the primary means of narration in the OVA. Over the next several weeks Keiichir≈ç begins to teach her about the world, and more indirectly about himself and his troubled past.  Characters  ; : : Keiichir≈ç is a young Japanese male who lives by himself. He used to play guitar in a band, but stopped after his family was killed in a car accident while driving to one of his live performances. He is religious and prays for his family regularly. Although he is kind and not antisocial, he generally keeps to himself and reflects on the past. Thanks to Flower, he attempts to pick up the guitar a few times and in the end decided to sing again. ; : : Flower is a Parents (service android) who was left by her previous master and discovered by Keiichir≈ç at the beginning of the OVA. She does not function initially, but begins to work overnight after Keiichir≈ç takes her home. She is energetic and excitable, and she likes to sing despite being tone-deaf. She also suffers from short-term memory loss, leading Keiichir≈ç to buy her a diary. She is very loyal to Keiichir≈ç and wished to stay by him. She later becomes Keiichir≈ç's trigger to \\"feel\\", which was what he needed to sing again.  Production  Although Kowarekake no Orgel was self-published, it featured a somewhat notable production cast: it was directed by Keiichiro Kawaguchi, who was also involved in the production of Great Teacher Onizuka and Hayate the Combat Butler, and featured voice acting by professional voice actors Tetsuya Kakihara (Keiichir≈ç) and Masumi Asano (Flower). The OVA also featured screenplay by Shinichi Inotsume and original character design by POP, which was adapted by K≈çhaka Nishio.  Music  The main ending theme, Kowarekake no Orgel („Åì„Çè„Çå„Åã„Åë„ÅÆ„Ç™„É´„Ç¥„Éº„É´, sharing the title of the OVA), as well as the image song Keiichir≈ç no Omoi (Êï¨‰∏ÄÈÉé„ÅÆÊÄù„ÅÑ) are performed by Japanese singer-songwriter Hiromi Sat≈ç, and composed by Tsukasa (of Sound Online).

Younis was an Urdu-speaking Hyderabadi Muslim of Hadhrami Chaush descent. His claim to fame comes from Khwaja Moinuddin's stage plays, particularly Taleem- e-Balighan in which he played the role of a butcher. His memorable plays were Lal Qilay Se Lalo Khait Tak, Mohammad Bin Qasim, Qisa Chahar Darwaish, Mirza Ghalib Bandar Road Par, Do Duni Panch, Khuda Ki Basti and Tanhaiyaan. His last play for PTV was Ba Adab Ba Mulahiza, after which he virtually retired from his acting career. He died at the age of 75, after a long illness on Wednesday 30 May 2006 in Karachi at his residence PIB Colony. Career Initially, Subhani Bayunus performed mostly in Khawaja Moinuddin‚Äôs plays, and it was due to him that he owed his move to PTV. It so happened that after the tremendous success of Khawaja sahib‚Äôs Lal Qilay Sey Lalukhet Tuk and Taleem-i-Balghaan, the writer was invited to adapt the plays for television. Subhani Bayunus, who had performed important roles in these plays on radio, took on the acting assignments on PTV with equal facility and subsequent success. He managed to carve out a niche for himself on PTV with brilliant performances in plays like Lal Qilay Sey Lalukhet Tuk, Taleem-i-Balghaan, Tanhaiyaan, Khuda Ki Basti, Mera Naam Mangu, Intizar Farmaiye, Janey Do, Insan Aur Aadmi, Ba Adab Ba Mulahiza Hoshiar, Akahri Chataan and Labbaik.https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/8827-subhani-ba-yunus-passes- away He had a knack of playing mystery roles and did a superb job with the lead role of detective Inspector Zuberi in Ali Zafar Jafri‚Äôs mystery series which was aired on TV and radio. He played character roles in many episodes of NTM‚Äôs Mystery Theatre which was re-telecast on a private TV channel a couple of years ago. It is said he worked for Ibn-e-Safi as well. Subhani Bayunus tried his hand in films and performed the role of a villain in Iqbal Akhtar‚Äôs Nadaan (1973). He played character roles in Ather Shah Khan Aas Paas (1982) and Iqbal Akhtar‚Äôs comeback failure Muskurahat (1995). He acted in a Gujarati film titled Mann Tey Maan and Javed Jabbar‚Äôs English-language film Beyond the Last Mountain (1977). It is said that the Mirza Ghalib role that made Subhani Bayunus a household name in the 1960s was originally given to Mohammad Yousuf. But the renowned man of letters Nazar Hyderabadi insisted that the role be given to Subhani Bayunus whose height and appearance made him bear a striking resemblance to Ghalib. Subhani Bayunus also played Ghalib in a documentary made by the Directorate of Films and Publications in 1968 as part of Ghalib‚Äôs centenary celebrations.

This design language is focused on typography and simplified icons, absence of clutter, increased content to chrome ratio (\\"content before chrome\\"), and basic geometric shapes. Early examples of MDL principles can be found in Encarta 95 and MSN 2.0. The design language evolved in Windows Media Center and Zune and was formally introduced as Metro during the unveiling of Windows Phone 7\\\\. It has since been incorporated into several of the company's other products, including the Xbox 360 system software, Xbox One, Windows 8, Windows Phone, and Outlook.com. Before the \\"Microsoft design language\\" title became official, Microsoft representative Qi Lu referred to it as the modern UI design language in his MIXX conference keynote speech. According to Microsoft, \\"Metro\\" has always been a codename and was never meant as a final product, but news websites attribute this change to trademark issues. Microsoft Design Language 2 (MDL2) was developed alongside Windows 10. Later, the Fluent Design language extended it. History The design language is based on the design principles of classic Swiss graphic design. Early glimpses of this style could be seen in Windows Media Center for Windows XP Media Center Edition, which favored text as the primary form of navigation, as well as early concepts of Neptune.https://www.itprotoday.com/windows-server/supersite-flashback-neptune This interface carried over into later iterations of Media Center. In 2006, Zune refreshed its interface using these principles. Microsoft designers decided to redesign the interface and with more focus on clean typography and less on UI chrome. These principles and the new Zune UI were carried over to Windows Phone first released in 2010 (from which much was drawn for Windows 8). The Zune Desktop Client was also redesigned with an emphasis on typography and clean design that was different from the Zune's previous Portable Media Center based UI. Flat colored \\"live tiles\\" were introduced into the design language during the early Windows Phones studies. In an interview it was explained that different Microsoft divisions use each other's products, and the extension of Metro was not a company-wide approach but instead teams such as Xbox liking Metro and adapting it for its own products. Many of Microsoft's divisions ended up adopting Metro.https://www.fastcompany.com/1665814/sometimes-microsoft-designs-great- things-heres-why-it-doesnt-ever-matter Microsoft Design Language 2 (MDL2) was developed alongside Windows 10. This version introduced a new set of widgets, including date pickers, toggles and switches, and reduced the border thicknesses for all user interface elements. Principles Microsoft's design team cites as an inspiration for the design language signs commonly found at public transport systems. The design language places emphasis on good typography and has large text that catches the eye. Microsoft sees the design language as \\"sleek, quick, modern\\" and a \\"refresh\\" from the icon-based interfaces of Windows, Android, and iOS. All instances use fonts based on the Segoe font family designed by Steve Matteson at Agfa Monotype and licensed to Microsoft. For the Zune, Microsoft created a custom version called Zegoe UI, and for Windows Phone Microsoft created the Segoe WP font family. The fonts mostly differ only in minor details. More obvious differences between Segoe UI and Segoe WP are apparent in their respective numerical characters. The Segoe UI font in Windows 8 had obvious differences ‚Äì similar to Segoe WP. Characters with notable typographic changes included 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, I, and Q. Joe Belfiore was one of the architects of Metro. At Nokia World 2011, Belfiore explained that the UI aims to be \\"artistic\\" in textual elements and iconograpy. He also mentioned the \\"motion\\" of the UI, specifically in Windows Phone, of the Live Tiles, moving dots, and kinetic scrolling.http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/13479_Building_a_different_kind_of_U.php Microsoft designed the design language specifically to consolidate groups of common tasks to speed up usage. It achieves this by excluding superfluous graphics and instead relying on the actual content to function as the main UI. The resulting interfaces favor larger hubs over smaller buttons and often feature laterally scrolling canvases. Page titles are usually large and consequently also take advantage of lateral scrolling. Animation plays a large part. Microsoft recommends consistent acknowledgement of transitions, and user interactions (such as presses or swipes) by some form of natural animation or motion. This aims to give the user the impression of an \\"alive\\" and responsive UI with \\"an added sense of depth\\". Reception =On mobile= Early response to the language was generally positive. In a review of the Zune HD, Engadget said, \\"Microsoft continues its push towards big, big typography here, providing a sophisticated, neatly designed layout that's almost as functional as it is attractive.\\" CNET complimented the design language, saying, \\"it's a bit more daring and informal than the tight, sterile icon grids and Rolodex menus of the iPhone and iPod Touch.\\" At its IDEA 2011 Ceremony, the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) gave Windows Phone 7, which uses the UI, its \\"Gold Interactive\\" award, its \\"People's Choice Award\\", and a \\"Best in Show\\" award. Isabel Ancona, the User Experience Consultant at IDSA, explained why Windows Phone won: It was reported that the UI was better received by women and first-time users.http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/13479_Building_a_different_kind_of_U.php Criticism particularly focused on the use of all caps text. With the rise of Internet usage, critics have compared this to a computer program shouting at its user. IT journalist Lee Hutchinson described Microsoft's use of the practice in the macOS version of OneNote as terrible, claiming that it is \\"cursed with insane, non-standard application window menus IN ALL CAPS that doesn‚Äôt so much violate OS X‚Äôs design conventions as it does take them out behind the shed, pour gasoline on them, and set them on fire.\\" = On Windows 8 desktop = With the arrival of Windows 8, the operating system's user interface and its use of the design language drew generally negative critical responses. On 25 August 2012, Peter Bright of Ars Technica reviewed the preview release of Windows 8, dedicating the first part of the review to a comparison between the Start menu designs used by Windows 8 and Windows 7. Recounting their pros and cons, Peter Bright concluded that the Start menu in Windows 8 (dubbed Start screen), though not devoid of problems, was a clear winner. However, he concluded that Windows 8's user interface was frustrating and that the various aspects of the user interface did not work well together. Woody Leonhard was even more critical when he said, \\"From the user's standpoint, Windows 8 is a failure ‚Äì an awkward mishmash that pulls the user in two directions at once.\\" In addition to the changes to the Start menu, Windows 8 takes a more modal approach with its use of full-screen apps that steer away from reliance on the icon-based desktop interface. In doing so, however, Microsoft has shifted its focus away from multitasking and business productivity. Name change In August 2012, The Verge announced that an internal memorandum had been sent out to developers and Microsoft employees announcing the decision to \\"discontinue the use\\" of the term \\"Metro\\" because of \\"discussions with an important European partner\\", and that they were \\"working on a replacement term\\". Technology news outlets Ars Technica, TechRadar, CNET, Engadget and Network World and mainstream press Bits Blog from The New York Times Company and the BBC News Online published that the partner mentioned in the memo could be one of Microsoft's retail partners, German company Metro AG, as the name had the potential to infringe on their \\"Metro\\" trademark. Microsoft later stated that the reason for de-emphasizing the name was not related to any current litigation, and that \\"Metro\\" was only an internal project codename, despite having heavily promoted the brand to the public. In some contexts, the company began using the term \\"Modern\\" or the more generic \\"Windows 8\\" modifier to refer to the new design, possibly as a placeholder. In September 2012, \\"Microsoft design language\\" was adopted as the official name for the design style. The term was used on Microsoft Developer Network documentation and at the 2012 Build conference to refer to the design language. In a related change, Microsoft dropped use of the phrase \\"Metro- style apps\\" to refer to mobile apps distributed via Windows Store.

With high expectations of having a chance to be the first high school athlete to qualify for the Olympics since Dwayne Evans and Lam Jones in 1976, Moore qualified for the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. Those dreams were dashed by a 7th place finish in the semi- finals.http://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf Olympic Trials results Later in 1996, Moore won the World Junior Championships in Sydney, Australia under cool conditions. Moore expected many better things to come. Moore looked at 1997, his senior year of high school, as the chance to set records out of sight. Instead, he suffered a minor injury early in the season. Still focused on setting records, Moore ignored the problem and continued to press. Some have also suggested Moore lost focus. However, the effects of expectations and celebrity certainly were a factor on the 17 year old's life. After three months of abusing his body, he reached the point where he could barely walk, records and championships were out of the question. Moore aspired to go to nearby powerhouse University of Southern California, but his SAT and then ACT scores left him .1 point away from eligibility. In order to improve his academic standing Moore went first to Pasadena City College, then Long Beach City College. Further attempts took him across the continent to Morehouse College. Moore spent his time in injury rehabilitation. His heart and aspirations were still in Southern California. He left Morehouse a year later. The following year, Moore ended up at Life University, an NAIA college. After a successful and healthy fall training season, he entered the Pomona Pitzer Invitational, a tune up meet before the Mt.

Abernathy was a pitcher. Over his major league career, he went 0‚Äì3 with an 11.07 earned run average (ERA), one complete game and 13 strikeouts in seven games, two starts. Abernathy batted right-handed and threw right-handed. Abernathy also played in the minor leagues. Over his career in the minors, Abernathy played with the Class-B Wilmington Blue Rocks (1942‚Äì1943); Class-A1, and later Double-A, Memphis Chickasaws (1944‚Äì1947); the Class-C Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets (1947); the Class-C Reidsville Luckies (1948); the Class-C, and later Class-B, Burlington Bees (1948‚Äì1949); and the Class-B Greensboro Patriots (1949). During his minor league career, Abernathy went 79‚Äì67 with a 3.39 ERA in 238 games. Abernathy also managed two minor league teams during the 1948 season. Amateur career Abernathy attended Elon University from 1939 to 1941. In 1939, both Abernathy and future Major League Baseball player Ed Sauer attended Elon University. In October 1974, Abernathy was inducted into the Elon University Sports Hall of Fame, recognized because of his contribution as an athlete at the college. Professional career =Philadelphia Athletics= Before the 1942 season, Abernathy was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics as an amateur free agent. Abernathy started his first professional season in 1942 with the Class-B Wilmington Blue Rocks. With the Blue Rocks, Abernathy went 8‚Äì6 with a 2.61 earned run average (ERA) in 27 games. He was a member of the Blue Rocks when they won the Interstate League pennant. During that season, Abernathy was called up to the Athletics at the major league level. He made his debut on September 19, 1942, against the Washington Senators. In what would be his only game that season, Abernathy pitched 2 innings and gave up three runs, all earned. On February 23, 1943, Abernathy re-signed with the Athletics. Abernathy participated in spring training with the Athletics during the 1943 season. In May, Abernathy was cut from the Athletics roster after giving up seven earned runs, all earned, in one inning pitched. Abernathy was then assigned to the Class-B Wilmington Blue Rocks where he went 16‚Äì10 with a 3.16 ERA in 38 games. He was tied for sixth in the Interstate League in wins. Abernathy made his return to the Athletics roster in September and finished the season with a record of 0‚Äì3 with a 12.89 ERA, one complete game and 10 strikeouts in five games, two starts. Abernathy spent what would prove to be his final season in the majors with the Athletics in 1944. In only one game, Abernathy gave up one earned run in one inning pitched. =Later career= After pitching one game with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1944, Abernathy started playing in the St. Louis Browns organization with the Class-A1 Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association. He went 6‚Äì6 with a 3.55 ERA in 23 games, 11 starts with the Chickasaws that season. In 1945, Abernathy continued playing with the Memphis Chickasaws. That season, he went 8‚Äì10 with a 3.65 ERA in 26 games, 20 starts. Abernathy was tied for first on Memphis in losses in 1945. During the 1946 season, still a member of the Memphis Chickasaws who were now redefined as a Double-A level team, Abernathy went 3‚Äì3 with a 3.48 ERA in nine games, seven starts. In 1947, Abernathy played for both the Double-A Memphis Chickasaws and the Class-C Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets. With the Chickasaws, he went 1‚Äì0 in two games. Abernathy later joined the Triplets where he went 14‚Äì12 with a 3.18 ERA in 39 games. He led the Leaksville-Draper-Spray team in wins. During the 1948 season, Abernathy made his managerial debut as the player-manager of two Carolina League teams; the Burlington Bees and the Reidsville Luckies. Combined between the two Class-C level teams, Abernathy went 13‚Äì10 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 games. During his tenure with the Bees, Abernathy was fined for throwing a baseball out of the ball park after getting upset over a call made by the umpire. After the incident, Abernathy apologized to his teammates and promised them that if he was ever fined again, he would buy them all a steak. In 1949, Abernathy's final season in professional baseball, he split the season between the Class-B Burlington Bees and the Class-B Greensboro Patriots, both of the Carolina League. In 37 combined games, Abernathy went 10‚Äì10 with a 4.18 ERA.

Biography Born in St Michael, Barbados, Wickham served in Palestine in the British West Indies Regiment of World War I.Howe, Glenford D., and Don D. Marshall (eds; 2001). The Empowering Impulse: The Nationalist Tradition of Barbados, Barbados: Canoe Press, p. 126.Alexander, Robert J., and Eldon M. Parker (2004). A History of Organized Labor in the English-Speaking West Indies. Westport, CT: Praeger, p. 251. After his return to Barbados, he joined The Herald newspaper, edited by Clement A. Inniss, in 1919 and wrote for universal adult suffrage in a column under the title \\"Audax\\" (the listener). Wickham became sole editor of the newspaper following Inniss's early death. In 1921, Wickham summarized attitudes of members of the Barbadian House of Assembly in the first years of the 20th century as follows: \\"There is no sense of duty to the individual of the island as a whole. There is no sense of responsibility for broad and reasonable treatment. There is merely a sense of class.\\" By the late 1920s, he developed a reputation for being one of the foremost critics of the plantocracy and brought into the open that, although patterned after British common law, Barbadian law in 1900 was in a sense an objective code of rules whose ethical validity transcended the interests and attitudes of several classes on the island.Richardson, Bonham C. (2004). Panama Money in Barbados 1900‚Äì1920, p. 23. In May 1924, Charles Duncan O'Neal (1879‚Äì1936) led a delegation, comprising Wickham, John Beckles, J. A. Martineau and J. T. C. Ramsay, that called on the Barbados governor and requested him to take steps to ensure that the Education Board exercised its powers under the Education Act to ban child labour. Appeals of this sort directed to the governor and to the Legislature were made at regular intervals over the next twelve years to little or no avail.Howe and Marshall (2001). The Empowering Impulse, p. 136. During the 1930s economic and social conditions across the West Indies finally brought the explosions that had been simmering for decades. Wickham was a prescient journalist whose writings in the Barbados Herald newspaper were a major catalyst for change. He had his finger more closely than most on the pulse of the people and had warned that \\"an inarticulate majority brooding over unrepressed wrongs and unventilated grievances is a serious menace\\". Barbados had a restricted voting system based on franchise and reinforced this system by allocating electoral worth only to those of a certain elevated social status. Clennell described the attitudes of the white assembly in the early 20eth century as follows: :\\"There is no sense of duty to the individuals of the island as a whole. There is no sense of responsibility for broad and reasonable treatment. There is merely a sense of class.\\"Lewis, Gary (1999). White Rebel: The Life and Times of TT Lewis. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, p. 7. Wickham shaped a lot of Atholl Edwin Seymour \\"TT\\" Lewis's (1905‚Äì1959) political thought, and he had a high regard for the man. Once Lewis took up a copy of Wickham's magazine Outlook, from which he proceeded to read an article by Clennell and proffered nothing but praise for the man. Lewis boasted that he had all the copies of his magazine. Lewis corresponded with Wickham and found him influential, lucid and of penetrating prose - stating Wickham had in the 1920s exposed, among other things, the social failings of the Barbadian plantation economy. By the time Lewis got to know Wickham, the latter had already lost a libel case in 1930 that separated him from the Herald newspaper and effectively exiled him to neighbouring island Grenada and suffered several years of frustration and great hardship. A Barbados special jury upheld the libel suit brought by the Bridgetown merchant W. D. Bayley against Clennell, which resulted in the termination of his editorship of the newspaper and a change of its ownership.Howe and Marshall (2001). The Empowering Impulse, p. 141.Hoyos, F. A. (1972). Builders of Barbados, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, pp. 117‚Äì25. Social upheaval spread throughout the British West Indies in the 1930s, taking the form of strikes and riots. Barbados was no exception, with the July Riots of 1937 that shocked the nation and led eventually to a wide range of political, social and labour reforms, as black middle-class Barbadians began to organise themselves in political parties and a labour union. The unrest was documented in a temporary exhibition by the Barbados Museum in 1998. By the time the riots were quelled fourteen people had been killed, forty-seven wounded and hundreds arrested.Roach, Penelope Hynam (5 May 1999). Museums, Peace, Democracy and Governance in the 21st Century. Barbados: Commonwealth Association of Museums' Triennial Conference, p. 2. During the 1930s to 1945 Wickham's contemporaries in the field of journalism and politics were O'Neal, Chrissie Brathwaite, Erskine Ward, Grantley Adams (1898‚Äì1971), Wynter Crawford (1910‚Äì1993), Hugh Springer (1913‚Äì1994), Frank Walcott (1916‚Äì1999), and H. A. Vaughan and many of these same leaders contributed directly to the creation and development of the BCL, the Barbados Labour Party, and Barbados Workers' Union.Sandiford, Keith A. P. (1998). Cricket Nurseries of Colonial Barbados: The Elite Schools, 1865-1966. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies, p. 21. Wickham founded and edited The Outlook: A Monthly Magazine and Review, known for his radical political views expressed primarily in his previous weekly Herald. It was not a true literary magazine since its focus was more ideological and political but the magazine considered the development of creative writing priority: \\"If we have any particular aspiration,\\" he wrote, \\"The Outlook may be the means of developing literary talent by providing opportunity\\" (October 1931). The magazine included short fiction, book reviews, and a sprinkling of poems in all its issues, along with its staples of political and social commentary. Its reviews of texts such as George S. Schuyler's Black No More (1931) were evidence of the linkages between the Harlem Renaissance and the West Indian awakening that would become even more pronounced in The Forum Quarterly. Unfortunately, The Outlook floundered by 1932 after only six issues. In its brief tenure, the journal served as a new avenue for literary expression, promoting language as a tool of resistance and cultural redefinition. In a manner that was revolutionary and unprecedented for the times, another short-lived journal published between 1931 and 1934, The Forum Quarterly envisaged its role as supplementing the work of other publications, such as the Herald newspaper edited by Wickham and Clement Inniss. Former Principal of UWI, Keith Hunte wrote: \\"The Herald provided a medium through which its editor, Clennell Wickham, poured trenchant criticism on the political behaviour of the local oligarchy and called attention to social ills that needed to be remedied.\\" The journal's further definition of its mission in The Literary Outlook, in the March 1932, recognized the potential of the synergies between literature and other publications of social discourse exploited chiefly by Clennell and Inniss, and O'Neale, with whom they had established the Democratic League in 1924: :\\"By hammering out a common language of the spirit we create a new kind of inter-colonial interest, and in accepting the fact that there lies about us material as artistic as any we know at only second or third hand, we emphasize West Indian consciousness. Indeed, this literary activity is only a reflection of a new activity in the social and political spheres.\\"Wade, Carl (2004). \\"A Forgotten Forum: the Forum Quarterly and the Development of West Indian Literature\\", Caribbean Quarterly. Vol. 50, No. 3, p. 63. Barbados: University of the West Indies. Barbados in the 1920s and 1930s was that liberalism was not rooted there. Were there any Liberals with whom Adams could ally? Wickham had demolished that idea in a devastating piece published in the Barbados Herald of 25 July 1925.Howe and Marshall (2001). The Empowering Impulse, pp. 170-71. When writing in January 1935, Wickham saw the need for mobilization of the workers as the basis for the democratic movement. A bill had been introduced every election campaign since August 1930 in the Assembly aimed at lowering the income qualification for a franchise but was thrown out by the Legislative Council. Not until an identical bill was introduced in the House in 1936 was it successfully moved and seconded by Chrissie Brathwaite; still, it failed: :\\"Till the working class is organized to provide the guts for the democratic movement political and social conditions will be what they are.\\"Howe and Marshall (2001). The Empowering Impulse, p. 144. Prior to the 1937 riots, the white planter and merchant were dominant in the Barbados Houses of the Legislature. But political activity in the working class was beginning to grow, under leaders such as Wickham, Inniss, and O'Neale. As a result of this rioting the Labour leaders of the time - Grant, Skeete, Lovell and Alleyne - were given heavy prison sentences for sedition, and one leader, Clement Osbourne Payne, was deported.Proudfoot, Mary (1954). Britain and the United States in the Caribbean: A Comparative Study in Methods of Development, London: Faber & Faber. p. 157. Clennell Wickham died in Grenada in 1938, aged 43. Barbara Wickham, his surviving younger sister (1999), related how on his return to Barbados he had been asked to vacate a church pew reserved for whites. Clennell stormed from the church, never to return. Gilbert Grindle, Assistant Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office in London, wrote that \\"the black man has come to think and feel of himself as good as the white\\".Smith, Richard (2008). Caribbean Studies - West Indians at War, Vol. 36, No. 1, ISSN 0008-6533. His son, John Wickham, followed in the footsteps of his father and became literary editor of The Nation,Gmelch, George, \\"Chapter 7: John Wickham\\", in Double Passage: The Lives of Caribbean Migrants Abroad and Back Home, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 129. one of the leading newspapers in Barbados. He had a career in the World Meteorological Organization, which took him to Europe for several years, and served for many years as the editor for the literary quarterly magazine BIM. His short stories have been widely anthologized. Among his collections are Casuarina Row (1974) and Discoveries (1993). He also co-edited The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories. Now an award in non-fiction prose, named after him, The John Wickham Scholarship, is presented each year to an individual who uses language to inspire, entertain and educate.BIM - National Cultural Foundation, Symbols of Excellence, Barbados (2007), Vol. 2, No. 1, p. 5.The John Wickham Scholarship, Barbados Community College website, 15 October 2010. The Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage was unveiled at the association's Clennell Wickham Memorial Lecture in 1996 by the Barbados Association of Journalists. Since November 2009, Clennell's grandchildren Fran Wickham and Peter W. Wickham (himself also a political journalist/commentator) now present the \\"Karin Dear‚Äôs Hall of Fame\\" award to deserving journalists at a ceremony held annually in Barbados. :\\"Regrettably I have to confirm that for the first time since my Grandfather Clennell Wickham started writing People and Things in the 1940s, this article has been unilaterally suspended by the Newspaper that agreed to host it. Clearly, my perspective on this occasion is very different to that which I offered during the 1999 and 2003 elections. I am therefore grateful to BU and to BFP for carrying this review of the politics of inclusion which is yet to see the light of day\\". ::- writes journalist Peter W. Wickham (31 December 2007) Rawdon J. H. Adams, son of Tom Adams and grandson of Grantley Adams, in a lecture in March 2010 said of Clennell: :\\"When my Grandfather returned to Barbados from Oxford in 1925 he was quickly marked as a man of argument ‚Äì opposing for opposing‚Äôs sake as his critics might have said. There were his battles with Clennell Wickham and the Democratic League of Dr Charles Duncan O‚ÄôNeal for which he was cast as a supporter of the status quo. Then came his attacks on the same status quo, the plantocracy, in the House of Assembly in 1934 one consequence of which was the near ruin of his legal practice.\\"Adams, Rawdon, \\"Tom Adams Memorial Lecture, March 11, 2010: The Value of Political Confrontation, Transparency and National Reputation in a Crisis\\".

It is one of 23 quota quickies Powell directed between 1931 and 1936. It features a largely forgotten cast - only Felix Aylmer, here in a minor role, would go on to a significant film career. Plot Impecunious bookmaker's clerk Arnold Grierson, seeing a way to easy money, forces his daughter Margaret to marry wealthy but obnoxious songwriter Nevern, ignoring her romance with local newspaper editor Michael Hardwick. Soon after the wedding, Grierson requests the loan of a significant sum of money from Nevern and is furious and humiliated to be flatly turned down. He begins to make elaborate plans to murder Nevern on the assumption that Margaret will then inherit her husband's estate. Meanwhile, the desperately unhappy Margaret has rekindled her relationship with Hardwick. Nevern finds them in a caf√© together and causes a public scene. Margaret determines that her only course of action is to divorce Nevern, a prospect which horrifies her father. Nevern is in the process of composing a new song, and lodges a draft manuscript with his publisher. Making sure he has set up a foolproof alibi, Grierson goes to Nevern's house and kills him as he is finalising his new composition. As he leaves through one door, Hardwick, intending to ask Nevern to divorce Margaret, arrives through another. Hardwick finds the body and alerts the police, who in the circumstances do not believe his story and arrest him on suspicion of murder. The interested parties later gather at Nevern's home to hear the reading of the will. Margaret is declared the sole inheritor of all her husband's money and assets, to the delight of her father. He is so happy that he begins to whistle, and gives himself away because it is Nevern's finished composition, which he could only have heard by being in the house on the night of the murder.

He was an uncle of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.  Background  Vicente Sodr√© was the son of Jo√£o Sodr√© (also known as Jo√£o de Resende) and Isabel Serr√£o. Although some say the Sodr√©s were a well-connected family of English origin, said to have been descended from Frederick Sudley from Gloucestershire, who accompanied the Earl of Cambridge to Portugal in 1381, and subsequently settled down there.(Subrahmanyam 1997: p.61) Sometime in the 1470s, Vicente Sodr√© entered the service of D. Diogo, Duke of Viseu, the grand master of the Order of Christ. Sodr√© joined the Order of Christ himself, and rose to the rank of commendador, holding the commenda of Maninhos in Idanha around 1493. In 1494, he was dispatched by the order's new grand master, Manuel, Duke of Beja, to the order-owned island of Madeira to audit the repairs of the defenses of the town of Funchal.See Vicente Sodr√©, o 1¬∫ Capit√£o-mor do Mar da √çndia (1465? - 1503) After Manuel, Duke of Beja succeeded to the throne as King Manuel I of Portugal in 1495, Vicente Sodr√©, became a knight of the royal household. Around 1501, Vicente Sodr√© succeeded his powerful relative Duarte Sodr√© as alcaide-mor of Tomar, that is governor of the town and great Templar citadel, the spiritual home of the Order of Christ.See Vicente Sodr√©, o 1¬∫ Capit√£o-mor do Mar da √çndia (1465? - 1503) Vicente Sodr√©'s siblings include his brother Br√°s Sodr√© and his sister Isabel Sodr√©, who married Est√™v√£o da Gama and became the mother of Vasco da Gama. Unlike the Sodr√©s, the Gamas were attached to the Order of Santiago, perennial rivals of the Order of Christ.  Expedition to India (1502)  In 1501, the 2nd Armada of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral finally returned from India, and preparations immediately began for the assembly of a new India armada (the 4th), to be sent out in 1502, again under Cabral. Vicente Sodr√© was appointed by King Manuel I of Portugal as the first Capit√£o-mor do Mar da √çndia ('Captain-major of the Indian Sea'), i.e. commander of the first Portuguese naval patrol in the Indian Ocean. Sodr√© was given a royal regimento, instructing him to patrol and prey on Arab shipping at the mouth of the Red Sea. Vicente Sodr√©'s patrol was designated to go to India as a distinct squadron of the 4th Armada of 1502, and to remain behind on patrol. However, Sodr√© insisted that his regimento be independent - that is, that the 4th armada's admiral, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, have absolutely no authority over his (Sodr√©'s) squadron for the duration of the voyage. King Manuel I of Portugal, who had strong doubts about Cabral's competence, agreed. Cabral found this condition humiliating and withdrew his name in a huff. Vicente Sodr√© helped secure the appointment of his nephew, Vasco da Gama, to replace Cabral as admiral of the 4th Armada. In the new regimento, Vasco da Gama would remain in command of Sodr√©'s squadron only until India, after which the new separate regimento would apply. The 4th India Armada under Vasco da Gama sailed out of Lisbon in February 1502, with Vicente Sodr√© in command of a squadron of five ships. After making stops in Mozambique Island and Kilwa, the armada arrived in India in September, engaging in various actions along the Indian coast in late 1502. Vicente Sodr√© is credited for rescuing Vasco da Gama from an ambush in Calicut harbor, and he took a leading role in the defeat of the large fleet of the Zamorin of Calicut at a naval battle before Calicut harbor in December. Vicente Sodr√© was responsible for a notorious incident (reported by chronicler Gaspar Correia (p. 307)) with a wealthy and well-connected Egyptian merchant in Cannanore, who was about to leave port without paying customs duties to the Cannanore port authorities. Sodr√© fetched him from his boat and marched him to the customs house. When the annoyed merchant, after paying his bill, muttered a curse about the Kolathiri Raja of Cannanore (a Portuguese ally), Vicente Sodr√© grabbed the merchant and, in full view of the customers officers and port crowds, stripped him naked, tied him to a post and had him beaten with clubs (the merchant being a fat man, Sodr√© ordered them to aim their clubs at his stomach). Taken down from the post half-dead, Sodr√© ordered the battered merchant tied up and then proceeded to fill his mouth with dirt and pieces of bacon (the merchant offered Sodr√© 10,000 gold pieces to forego this final humiliation, but he rejected it). The merchant would go on to Cairo, and report his mistreatment in the court of Mameluke Sultan al-Ashraf Qansuh al- Ghawri. Correia suggests the Egyptian merchant's testimony was critical in rousing the sultan into taking more active steps against the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean.  Indian Ocean Patrol (1503)  In February 1503, Vasco da Gama returned with the 4th Armada to Lisbon, leaving Vicente Sodr√© behind in the command of the Indian Ocean patrol (five or six ships, one of which was under the command of his own brother, Br√°s Sodr√©). However, before his departure, Vasco da Gama ordered his uncles to keep the patrol near the Malabar Coast of India, to protect the Portuguese-allied cities of Cochin and Cannanore from any vengeful attacks by the Zamorin of Calicut. However, as soon as Gama left, Vicente Sodr√© invoked his regimento and ordered the patrol to leave India and follow him to the Red Sea. The Portuguese factors in Cochin and Cannanore protested, citing evidence of imminent preparations for an attack by the Zamorin. It said that two of the patrol captains refused to go along, and resigned the commands of their ships. Vicente Sodr√© dismissed the rumors and took the patrol with him.The 1503 letter of Diogo Fernandes Correia (p.211), the Portuguese factor of Cochin notes how Vasco da Gama promised the King of Cochin \\"that he would leave him Vicente Sodr√© to guard this port and coast; after his departure, the coast was abandoned by our armed ships, and the King of Calicut came here and did what you already know.\\" [\\"que lhe leixaria aqui vicente Sodr√© para elle guardar este porto e costa; depois de sua yda, qua costa ficou despejada de nossas naos darmada, elRei de calecut veyo aqui e fez o que ja sabeis\\"] As expected, in March 1503, the Zamorin of Calicut arrived before Cochin with an army of 50,000, and seized and burned down the city. The Portuguese factors, along the Cochin's ruler, managed to escape to the nearby island of Vypin. They continued to hold out until August, when the next armada arrived. During the siege of Cochin, Vicente Sodr√©'s patrol was nowhere to be seen. It had gone first north to Gujarat, where it captured a great merchant ship off Chaul. The patrol then sailed west into the Gulf of Aden, at the mouth of the Red Sea, to catch more prizes. Vicente Sodr√©'s patrol captured around five Arab merchant ships at the mouth of the Red Sea. But the partition of the spoils left a lot to be desired - the Sodr√© brothers set about claiming the lion's share of the plunder for themselves, and leaving little for the others or even the crown(Br√°s Sodr√©, in particular, was accused of embezzling the royal fifth due to the crown).According to P√™ro de Ata√≠de's 1504 letter to King Manuel I (p.262-63), Br√°s Sodr√© took items from plunder despite \\"being told there and then by your clerk that such items had not yet been recorded in the your lordship's book\\" and, in his takings, \\"nobody dared grab his hand because his brother consented to everything he did\\". [\\"e dito loguo ally polo seu escrivam e mestre que taaes couzas naom eram asemtadas em livro de vosa senhoria afora outras muitas que elle tomava quando queria porque ninguem naom ousava de lhe ir a m√£o porque lhe seu irmao dava consentymento a tudo fazer\\"] Already unhappy at abandoning their brethren in India, the patrol captains quarreled with the Sodr√©s and nearly mutinied. Around 20 April 1503, the patrol anchored in at Kuria Muria islands (off the coast of Oman). The local inhabitants warned them that a seasonal tempest was forming and that they had better move their ships to a safer shelter on the southern side of the island. Four patrol captains moved their ships accordingly, but Vicente Sodr√© and Br√°s Sodr√© refused (the ongoing quarrel over the spoils may have been a factor in this separation.) As the locals predicted, the tempest came on April 30, and sunk the exposed ships of Vicente Sodr√© and Br√°s Sodr√©. In the aftermath, the four remaining ships of the Indian Ocean patrol, now under the command of P√™ro de Ata√≠de, elected to return at once to India. Ata√≠de would later (in February 1504) compose a letter to the king, with an account of the travails of the Indian Ocean patrol.\\"Carta de Pero de Atayde a El-rei D. Manuel, Fevereiro 20, 1504\\", as published in Bulh√£o Pato, R.A. editor, 1898, Cartas de Affonso de Albuquerque, seguidas de documentos que as elucidam. Lisbon: Academia Real de Sciencias, vol. 2, p.262-68 He carefully excused Vicente Sodr√©'s actions, laying most of the blame on the bad counsel and decisions of Br√°s Sodr√© (who really comes out as the villain of the story). Although it is significant that Ata√≠de, in that same letter, asked the king to grant him Vicente Sodr√©'s old position of alcalde-mor of Tomar (Ataide, alas, died shortly after in Mozambique). Ata√≠de wrote that Vicente Sodr√© sunk and died immediately in the tempest at Kuria Muria, but that Br√°s Sodr√© actually survived the wreck. However, once ashore, Br√°s Sodr√© decided to blame his Muslim pilots and executed them on the spot. Ata√≠de refrains from saying exactly what happened to Br√°s Sodr√© after that, only that 'many things transpired' before his death.Ataide, p.263; Subrahmanyam, 1997: p.231  Shipwrecks  The wreck site of Vicente and Bras Sodr√©'s ships was first discovered just off the north- eastern coast of Al Hallaniyah island, Oman, in May 1998 by a two-person team from Blue Water Recoveries Ltd (BWR); location was based on the company's own analysis of historical documents. Later that year, a larger team from BWR, including a contracted nautical archaeologist from Portugal, conducted a reconnaissance survey of the bay and wreck site. They recovered a number of artifacts consistent with an early 16th-century shipwreck, including lead- covered iron shot, stone cannonballs of varying sizes, and a sounding lead. Expeditions were conducted under a permit from the Oman Government. No further investigation of the site was conducted, primarily because of the considerable complexity and cost of supporting a full archaeological excavation in this remote location. These challenges were addressed in 2013 by David L. Mearns, owner and Director of BWR, and an agreement was made with Oman's Ministry of Heritage and Culture (MHC) to jointly conduct and co-manage the project. The MHC is the official government body responsible for the protection of Oman's underwater cultural heritage, and this was the first collaborative archaeological excavation of a historic wreck-site in Omani waters. Additional funding and support was provided by National Geographic's Expeditions Council and the non-profit Waitt Institute. Comprehensive geophysical surveys of Ghubatt ar Rahib bay and archaeological excavations of the near-shore wreck site took place in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Underwater archaeology was directed by Dave Parham, Associate Professor in Maritime Archaeology at Bournemouth University, while Dr. Bruno Frohlich, Emeritus Scientist from the Smithsonian Institution, led investigation of possible land burial sites. Over the three field seasons, expedition teams of 12 to 18 spent a total of 50 days working on site, and accumulated 1,079 hours underwater. More than 2,800 artifacts have been recovered from the site, including a ship's bell with a date of 1498, an important copper-alloy disc marked with the royal coat of arms of Portugal and the \\"esfera armilar\\"(armillary sphere) - a personal emblem of King Manuel I, and an extremely rare silver coin known as the \\"INDIO\\", first minted in 1499 by the Portuguese specifically for trade with India. The disc was later confirmed to be a unique and rare mariner's astrolabe that has been named the Sodr√© Astrolabe. Salvaged objects also included a large quantity of ordinance (stone, iron and lead shot, and 19 copper-alloy breech chambers). They underscore the military mission of the Sodr√© squadron. On 15 March 2016, the MHC formally announced the discovery of the wreck site at a press conference in Muscat, and simultaneously published an interim print report by Mearns, Parham and Frohlich in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. A project-specific website was also launched. The IJNA article, which relies on extensive scientific testing of the recovered objects and contributions from numerous other experts, also concludes that the probable source of the remaining, unsalvaged wreckage is from Vicente Sodr√©'s ship \\"Esmeralda\\".  Reputation  Despite Ata√≠de's efforts at gentle treatment, Portuguese 16th-century chroniclers have usually presented Vicente Sodr√© in a negative light - principally because of his abandonment of Cochin to the assault of the Zamorin of Calicut. Sodr√©'s greed for spoils is blamed for nearly costing the Portuguese their position in India and dishonoring their name before their Indian allies. At the Battle of Cochin (1504), the new Portuguese patrol captain Duarte Pacheco Pereira had a hard time persuading the Cochinese that he would not abandon them, as Sodr√© had done. In King Manuel of Portugal's regimento to Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1508, the king himself explicitly cites Vicente Sodr√©'s carelessness and cost to the crown.Subrahmanyam, 1997: p.234 Chronicler Gaspar Correia perhaps goes furthest in vilification, portraying Vicente Sodr√© as a brutish, greedy and petty tyrant. \\"A man of strong condition and lustful for money, with no other intention but to enrich himself\\"Correia (p.343) \\"homem forte de condi√ß√£o, e cobi√ßoso por dinheiro, e nom ficava com outra ten√ß√£o sen√£o de enriquecer, e como homem que bem queria arrecadar vendia e arrecadava dinheiro das cousas que tomava\\" Correia cites Vicente Sodr√©'s mistreatment of a well-connected Cairo merchant in Cannanore as the spark which set off the assembly of an Egyptian-led fleet to dislodge the Portuguese from the Indian Ocean in 1507. Vicente Sodr√© was the subject of an 1894 historical romance by Manuel Pinheiro Chagas. Vicente Sodr√© had two sons - Jo√£o Sodr√© and a natural son, Fern√£o Sodr√©, born of the unmarried Isabel Fernandes, who was legitimized by special letter from the king and went on to have a career of note as governor of Hormuz.See Liga√ß√µes familiares de Vasco da Gama pelo lado materno Sim√£o Sodr√©, later a captain in the Indies, was the only son of Br√°s Sodr√©. It is sometimes thought that the Lisbon railway station of Cais do Sodr√© (Sodr√©'s Wharf) was named after Vicente Sodr√©. In fact it was named after Duarte Sodr√©, his relative and predecessor in Tomar, who owned a couple of estates in the area.

History  Micha≈Ç Gryzi≈Ñski was working in a hot plasma group of the Polish Academy of Sciences on an approach to nuclear fusion which has later evolved to what is currently known as dense plasma focus. His experimental and theoretical consideration have led him 1957 to the \\"Stopping Power of a Medium for Heavy, Charged Particles\\" Phys. Rev. article emphasizing the importance of the orbital motion of electrons of a medium for stopping of slow charged particles. This work has received great interest and has led him to a series of articles about the problem of scattering with classical approximation of dynamics of the electrons, his 1965 articles have received a total of more than 2000 citations. This classical approximation of the dynamics of electrons in atoms has led him to the free-fall atomic model to improve agreement with scattering experiments comparing to the popular Bohr approximation as circular orbits for electrons. This dominant radial dynamics of electrons makes the atom effectively a pulsating electric multipole (dipole, quadrupole), what allowed him to propose an explanation for the Ramsauer effect (1970) and improve agreement for modeling of low energy scattering (1975). His later articles try to expand these classical approximations to multielectron atoms and molecules.  Free-fall atomic model  In the Bohr model electrons are imagined as traveling in circular orbits, which explains the quantized energy levels but leads to several other disagreements with experimental results. For example, in the observed electron capture process the nucleus captures an electron from an orbital, what needs this electron to get to a distance of the range of nuclear forces (femtometers), which is many orders of magnitude smaller than in Bohr model. Another fundamental disagreement for the circulating electron is the created magnetic field not observed for hydrogen. In contrast, the angular momentum of the electron in quantum ground state of hydrogen is zero. Gryzinski presents many other arguments, especially for agreement with various scattering scenarios, to focus on nearly zero angular momentum trajectories: with electrons traveling through nearly radial trajectories. Attracted by the Coulomb field they free-fall to the nucleus, then increase the distance up to some turning point and so on. The free-fall atomic model focuses on Kepler- like orbits for very low angular momentum. They are not exactly ellipses due to adding the magnetic dipole moment of the electron (electron magnetic moment) into considerations, which results in a Lorentz force proportional to v/r^3 and perpendicular to the velocity and spin of the electron. This spin- orbit interaction is nearly negligible unless the electron passes very close to the nucleus (small r\\\\approx 10^{-13} m , large v). This force bends the trajectory of the electron, preventing any collision with the nucleus. For simplicity, most of these considerations neglect small changes of orientation of the spin axis of electron, assuming that it is firmly oriented in space - this is called rigid top approximation. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is thousands of times smaller than the electron's, so such hyperfine corrections can be neglected in basic models. Finally the basic considered Lagrangian for dynamics of a single electron in these models is: \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\frac{1}{2}m\\\\mathbf{v}^2+\\\\frac{Ze^2}{r}+\\\\frac{Ze}{c}\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}}{r^3}\\\\right)\\\\right] The last term describes the interaction between the magnetic field of the traveling electron's magnetic moment and the electric field of the nucleus (spin-orbit interaction).

It lies at the top of the hill in Namobuddha Municipality. It is one of the most beautiful and a center for tourism. The main festivals and mela celebrated here are Kartik Purnima and Buddha Jayanti. According to the old legend, 6000 years ago, prince (Mahasatwo/Ngingdui Tshenpo), at the top of the hill, looking the jungle, discovers a tigress lying near the rock. Very quickly, he realizes that the tigress was about to die due to hunger with her five little babies still sucking milk from her, survivals of the babies depend on their mother. Mahasatwo, decides to give his life to the tigress in a bust of love and compassion. So Prince Mahasatwo cuts his body to present his warm blood in the mouth of the mother tiger, and the taste of blood gives the appetite to the starving family. As the tigress accepts the sacrifice from prince she leaves only the bones. The bones of prince were brought back in the village and buried in the tomb which is actual stupa of Namo Buddha. Some about 3500 years later, the Gautam Buddha came in the village of Sange da Fyafulsa, He conducts 3 tour around the Stupa before he declared that he was the reincarnation of prince Mahasatwo. It was the moment that Gautam Buddha renamed this village which is henceforth the name of Namo Buddha which means Hommage to Buddha. 160px The Ancient Story of Namo Buddha Thrangu Tashi Yangtse Monastery website Since it was founded by V.V.

Security * Perimeter security * CCTV in basement and main entrance lobby for surveillance * Video door phone at main door in every apartment. 2.1 Common Wealth Games Village, New Delhi The Commonwealth Games 2010 is being scheduled to be held in the capital city of New Delhi. The games village was accommodated by the players during the games and is now occupied by individual private home-owners. A 47.3 hectare (118 acre) picturesque site has been selected on the banks of holy river Yamuna for the purpose of construction of the games village. The project site is within the immediate vicinity of heritage monuments and historical landmarks, combined with dense green natural covers on the sides. 2.1.1 Site and landscape The proposed development consists of 4000 bedrooms spread across 34 towers varying in heights (such as; 7 storeys to 9 storeys high). The proposed apartment‚Äôs blocks are arranged in site in a way so as to create visual links with heritage sites in the vicinity. The topsoil of the entire excavated site has been collected and stored separately and special measures have been taken for soil stabilisation, such as- stockpiling, mulching, and so on. Pervious paving has been provided extensively in the site . All the service lines and utility corridors on the site are well aggregated and ensure minimum disruption during future maintenance work. 2.1.2 Health and well-being The sanitation/safety facilities for the construction workers are provided as per National Building Code 2005. These include provision of clean and hygienic accommodation, toilet facilities, purified drinking water, general store, a subsidised canteen, medical facilities, day care centre and onsite safety equipment, and so on. Significant measures have been taken to reduce air pollution during construction, such as ‚Äì site roads are regularly sprayed with water; wheels of all vehicles are washed, and so on. 2.1.3 Water Water efficient landscaping is being practised to minimise post construction water usage. This is being done by providing native species, efficient irrigation systems and by limiting lawn areas. The building water consumption also has been reduced by use of high efficiency low-flow fixtures. The construction water management on site is very efficient in terms of reuse of waste water and less utilisation of potable water in construction. 2.1.4 Building design and energy The building design has also included the existing site features, such as, the visual linkages with historical monuments, solar geometry, and so on. Due to high density planning requirements, the design did not permit optimum orientation for all apartment blocks. As a result, the apartment blocks have equal exposure towards all cardinal directions. However, the critical facades are shaded and have high performance glazing to negate impact of direct incident radiation. The buildings are fully compliant with the Energy Conservation Building Code 2007. Several energy efficiency measures such as roof insulation, high performance glazing, energy efficient lighting and variable refrigerant volume (VRV) based air conditioning system have been provided to reduce the energy consumption of the apartments significantly. 2.1.5 Renewable energy Solar photo voltaic system is proposed to meet the 10% of total energy requirements for internal lighting. 31% of outdoor lighting is provided through solar energy. Solar hot water systems are provided to meet part of water heating needs. 2.1.6 Other features Waste water recycling and solid waste management for the entire campus are being planned by the Delhi Jal Board at a macro level for the village as well as adjoining See also * 2010 Commonwealth Games * Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games References External links * BBC photos illustrating the Athletes' village construction controversy * Official site Village 2010 Commonwealth Games Village Category:Venues of the Commonwealth Games ","title":"Commonwealth Games Village, Delhi"},{"id":"28305661","text":"Photograph of Archbishop Chrysostomos II Chrysostomos II (, 1880‚Äì1968) was Archbishop of Athens and All Greece from 14 February 1962 to 11 May 1967.

Life  Patriarch Chrysostomos was born in 1878 in Asia Minor. After he completed his gymnasium education, he entered the Theological School of Halki, graduating 1902. He then joined the faculty of the University of Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland. At the university he was able to establish a relationship with the various heterodox people. After his return to Greece, Chrysostomos was ordained a deacon as he entered holy orders. In 1910, he was consecrated bishop as vicar to the Metropolitan of Smyrna. In 1913, he was appointed Metropolitan of Philadelphia. During his tenure at Philadelphia, Metr. Chrysostomos engaged in activities involving national liberation that resulted in his being sentenced to death by the Sultan's Viceroy Rahmi Bey. However, through the intervention of some influential people he escaped execution. Subsequently, Metr. Chrysostomos was transferred and named Metropolitan of Ephesus. In 1922, Metr. Chrysostomos moved to Greece following the exchange of people that took place after the Second Greco-Turkish War. In Greece, he was appointed the metropolitan of a new metropolis, a position he retained until he was elected Archbishop of Athens. In 1961, Metr. Chrysostomos presided at the Pan-Orthodox Meeting of Rhodes that was a preparatory meeting to an Orthodox wide synod . Metr. Chrysostomos was elected Archbishop of Athens on 14 February 1962. Following the military coup in April 1967, Abp. Chrysostomos was pressured by the new military government to step down. On 11 May 1967, Abp. Chrysostomos was forced to retire as the ruling hierarch of Greece. In June 1968, he died.

Only one was produced but this machine continues to fly in a research program into laminar flow over wings. Design and development The Leichflugtechnik-Union (LFU) was a consortium formed by the B√∂lkow, P√ºtzer and Rhein-Flugzeugbau companies specifically to produce an aircraft built entirely of glass reinforced plastic (grp). The result, the LFU 205 was one of the first all-grp light aircraft. The LFU 205 is a single-engined, low-winged monoplane of conventional appearance apart from slight, 7¬∞ forward sweep on the moderately tapered wing. This carries Fowler flaps along the whole trailing edge inboard of the Frise ailerons. The tail surfaces are also straight tapered, with the vertical surfaces slightly swept. The tailplane is a single piece, all moving surface. There are two pairs of side by side seats under a large curved, rearward sliding, canopy. Fuselage and flying surfaces are monocoque structures using a grp sandwich with a smooth outer surface bonded to a corrugated inner skin, the latter formed from parallel 10 mm (0.4 in) tubes wrapped in glass fibre. The corrugations run chordwise, rib-like, in the wings and tail and circumferentially in the fuselage. The tail structures have a foam plastic core. It is powered by a flat 4-cylinder, 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 engine and has a tricycle undercarriage with inward retracting main legs and an aft retracting nosewheel. The first flight was on 29 March 1968. Operational history The LFU 205 was intended as an experimental aircraft and only one was built. The initial flying programme was to test the constructional methods. Since 1984 it has flown with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at Brunswick, Germany. It has been used in a research program into laminar flow aerofoils by fitting a \\"glove\\" of the new profile over the wings of the LFU 205 in the central sections inboard of the ailerons on both sides. One prime interest is in the transition region between laminar and turbulent flow, studied using infra-red imaging. The gloved regions are also instrumented to gain data on pressure and drag distributions and boundary layer behaviour.

He is best known for his significant contribution to the renaissance and further development of the astronomical theory of paleoclimates and as a cited pioneer of the interdisciplinary study of climate dynamics and history. Biography Trained in mathematics, Andr√© Berger has a PhD in sciences from the Universit√© catholique de Louvain (1973) and a master of sciences in meteorology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1971). He received an honorary doctoral degrees from the Universit√© d'Aix-Marseille III (1989), the Universit√© Paul Sabatier de Toulouse (1999) and the Facult√© Polytechnique de Mons (2004). He is presently emeritus professor and senior researcher at UCL. Andr√© Berger is a very well known figure in the field of paleoclimatology. He is one of the pioneers who participated in the renaissance of the astronomical theory of paleoclimate (also known as the Milankovitch theory) in the 1970s, and to its promotion and development in the following decades. He has renewed this theory and improved the accuracy of the long term variations of the astronomical parameters used for the calculation of the incoming solar radiation (insolation) over the last and next millions of years. He became known in 1977 for his paper in Nature and later in the Journal of Atmospheric Physics (1978) delivering all the spectral components of the long term variations of eccentricity, obliquity (axial tilt) and climatic precession. His contributions have played a key role in the time scale calibration and interpretation of the paleoclimate records and in the modelling of the glacial-interglacial cycles. He has mainly worked on the simulation of past and future climates in close collaboration with physicists and geologists worldwide. He was at the origin of the very first Earth model of intermediate complexity. He was full professor of meteorology and climatology at UCL, ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the Universit√© de Li√®ge where he was Chaire Francqui in 1989, visiting professor at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and has been invited to many other universities in Europe, America and Asia. He was invited to deliver the Union Lecture of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 1987, the Society Lecture of European Geophysical Society (EGS) in 1994 and the Slichter Lecture at the University of California Los Angeles in 2001. He was chairman of the Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics Georges Lema√Ætre from 1978 to 2001, a period during which he started there to develop climate research. He was the supervisor of 22 doctoral degree theses and continues to serve as a jury member for academic tenure and habilitation.

It was formed by combining all previous Foot Guard Regiments and was, from its inception, the bodyguard-regiment of Kings of Prussia. Save William II, who also wore the uniforms of other regiments, all Prussian Kings and most Princes of Prussia wore the uniform of the 1st Foot Guard Regiment. All Princes of Prussia were commissioned lieutenants in the 1st Foot Guards upon their tenth birthdays. The King of Prussia was also the Colonel-in-chief of the regiment, as well as the Chief of the 1st Battalion and 1st Company of the regiment. Therefore, the regiment held the highest rank within the Prussian Army, which, among other things, meant that the officer corps of the regiment marched before the princes of the German Empire and the diplomatic corps in the traditional New Year's reception. Unofficially, the regiment was known as the \\"First Regiment of Christendom\\" (). The regiment was disbanded in 1919 when the Imperial German Army was dissolved, with the Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam of the new Reichsheer bearing its tradition.

In 1855 the Royal Navy launched a series of operations into the Gulf of Leotung and surrounding area to suppress piracy, several battles were fought and hundreds of pirates were killed.Wombwell, pg. 114-155 Background In the 1850s the southern China coast was base for many different pirate groups, Eli Boggs' being the most famous. Vessels used by the Chinese pirates were armed with guns ranging from thirty-two pounders and down and had complements on average of fifty or more. European and American sailors often were among the pirate crews. The war-junks engaged in the Leotung battle carried six to over eighteen guns each and all displaced ninety to 200 tons, with the exception of the lorchas which were larger and better armed. Several pirate fleets operated in the Pearl River Delta and it became the target of a British counter-piracy operation in mid to late 1855. One expedition of one brig and two chartered steamers was under the command of Captain Charles Turner. The brig was HMS Bittern carrying twelve guns and 125 officers, crew and marines, she was under Commander Edward W. Vansittart. The steamer Confucius was crewed by Chinese sailors and armed by guns from the frigate USS Macedonian but she did not engage in battle as she ran low on coal and was forced to leave the expedition not long after it began. The other steamer Pavushan or Paoushan was not armed but was commanded by Captain Turner and used to tow the Bittern through shallow water.Wombwell, pg. 114-155Cohen Battle A painting of Chinese junks, circa 1850. On August 18 while sailing in the Gulf of Leotung, the Pavushan and the Bittern came within sight of thirty-seven to forty junks, including two lorchas. They were positioned near the mouth of the river which led to Fuchan. Later Commander Vansittart reported that because of the heavy rain and thick mist he could not get an accurate count of the pirate ships he spotted. Bittern and Pavushan advanced until just over two miles away from the pirate fleet and anchored for the night. The following morning the pirates initiated the battle after they formed two divisions and began an advance towards the British ships. When within range the pirates opened up with their cannon and the British returned fire. The pirates' armament mostly included long 18-pounders which gave them a further range so for about ten minutes the two sides dueled but only the Chinese were capable making any hits. Bittern was the main target for Chinese fire and was struck a few times before achieving her first hit. Most of the pirates' fire reportedly passed over and through the sails and rigging of the Royal Navy vessels and when the pirates came within range of the Bittern her broadsides became more accurate and she raked several vessels and apparently damaged them severely. Due to this the pirates were forced to regroup and retreat. Attempting to trick the British into running aground; the pirates fled through a mess of reef and sandbars. The trick failed and the Bittern was able to maneuver through the treacherous waters and keep up her heavy fire. Both of the lorchas, the vessels said to have fired the most accurate shots, were sunk along with six other junks. The remaining thirty or so vessels escaped and towed at least five damaged junks away. An estimated 300 pirates became casualties and none were captured, some of the pirates were thought to be European. Bittern and Pavushan did not receive too much damage and none of the British service men were harmed in an action that lasted around an hour.Wombwell, pg. 114-155 Aftermath The pirate fleet headed north for New Chang where they seized several merchant ships and threatened to kill hostages and attack the port if $100,000 was not paid to them. They killed one Chinese sailor and sent his body ashore in a basket so afterwards the Chinese officials gave into the demands and the ransom was paid. Before freeing the merchantmen they forced the crews to pay them 1,200 dollars for each ship. Those who could not afford to pay were killed and their ships burned. The pirates then split into several smaller groups and hid themselves among the Pearl River's several streams and tributaries. On August 20, the morning after the battle, Bittern was under tow by Pavushan and headed north to begin freeing the dozens of captured merchantmen all over the region. In western Mid-Tao Strait they encountered thirteen of the pirate craft and after another battle, one was captured and turned over to the Chinese government and ten others were sunk by gun fire or first burned and then sunk. Bittern and Pavushan sunk another junk on August 30, north of Staunton Island and later in September, they fought the Battle of Sheipoo against Eli Boggs' fleet. Captain Charles Turner was killed in the battle and Commander Vansittart took command and finished the action with a decisive British victory.Wombwell, pg. 114-155 Vansittart later became a vice admiral in the Royal Navy.

It is one of the biggest international development organizations, with a network of hundreds of partner organizations in 31 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and has a disposable annual budget of around 115 million euros (2016).http://www.cordaid.nl/Over_ons/In_cijfers/Index.aspx?mId=5706 Cordaid directly employs almost 400 people, amongst them 182 are based in the Netherlands and the rest are stationed all over the world (2010). Cordaid is also known under the names of the funds it manages: Cordaid Memisa, Cordaid Mensen in Nood (People in Need), Cordaid Bond Zonder Naam (Association Without Name), Cordaid Kinderstem (Children's Voice).  History  Cordaid was founded in 1999 in The Hague, with the aim of helping people in distress and fighting structural poverty. It is a merge of three Dutch Catholic development organizations: Memisa Medicus Mundi (created in 1925), Mensen in Nood (People in Need, created in 1914) and Lenten Campaign/Bilance. The history of these organizations goes back to the beginning of the 20th century when they were active in the area of shelter and (missionary) care for refugees, providing direct aid in the event of disasters, medical care and direct improvement of the social and economic position of poor people. The merger allowed the newly created NGO to benefit from broader resources, rationalized management and organization and aimed at coordinating actions and projects. Each organization became a fund with Kinderstem (Children's voice) being part of Mensen in Nood, until October 2004, when Cordaid's General Assembly voted the creation of a separate fund focusing on aid to children living in slums. Cordaid Microcredit was formed in October 2006, following the tenth anniversary of the microfinance activities. On 1 January 2007, the Dutch NGO Bond Zonder Naam (founded in 1938) joined Cordaid. Since 2012 the campaigning cooperation with the Lenten Campaign Foundation ('Vastenaktie') has ended. In the beginning of 2018, Cordaid continues its activities under the brand name Cordaid. The different funds continue to exist as topics: humanitarian aid (Mensen in Nood), health care (Memisa), education (Kinderstem), investments (Microkrediet) and poverty in The Netherlands (Bond Zonder Naam).  Collaboration  Cordaid is represented in three international Catholic networks: CIDSE, Caritas International, and Medicus Mundi International. Cordaid is working closely with national and international NGOs, such as Darfur Emergency Response, Faith-Based Network, Pax Christi, STOP AIDS NOW!, Impunity Watch and United Civilians for Peace.

History The regiment's tradition dated back to 1626, when Elector George William of Brandenburg had a standing mercenary unit established during the Thirty Years' War, in order to defend the borders of his margraviate. The 1st Grenadier regiment was formed after the Napoleonic Wars of Liberation on 14 October 1814 by order of King Frederick William III of Prussia and was named in honour of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, who was also its first colonel-in- chief. Parts of the formation had distinguished themselves in the 1807 Siege of Kolberg, most of its officers had been decorated with the Iron Cross or the order Pour le M√©rite. The regiment was elevated to the rank of a royal guard on 18 February 1820. First based near Alexanderplatz in Berlin, the garrison about 1900 moved into larger barracks near Friedrichstra√üe station, which until 1990 were occupied by the Friedrich Engels Guard Regiment of the East German National People's Army. The former parade ground today is the site of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. After World War I, the regiment was demobilized on 27 November 1918, though volunteers were still employed by the Weimar government in the Silesian Uprisings and against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Officially disbanded with effect of 31 December 1920, the remaining forces formed the 9th and 12th company of the Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam, carrying the Alexandriner tradition further in the new Reichswehr military organization.

The Bali Peetam and the Kodi Maram (flag post) are seen at the entrance. Further ahead is \\"Garuda Azhwar\\" praying to the Lord with folded hands facing the main deity. Ahead is the Maha Mandapam and the Ardah Mandapam. On entering, devotees have a spiritual experience hearing the divine words \\"Om Namo Narayana\\" in their hearts. The main deity is in the form of a Swayambu in the sanctum sanctorum. The Lord \\"Sri Venkatesa Perumal\\" facing eastward gives his divine darshan to his devotees. As one continues to pray here, devotees receive the darshan with the blessings of the Lord and experience an inner calm and a flow of divine energy within. Devotees then come out to the inner \\"Prakaram\\" (corridor) of the temple. Moving clockwise, there is the sannidhi of \\"Venugopalaswamy\\" and then a passage having the sannidhi of \\"Chakrathazhwar\\" facing east. Coming back to the inner prakaram(outer courtyard) is the sannidhi of \\"Anjanaiyar\\" (Sri Hanuman).

The Sudarshana Chakra is the one which is known as the \\"Chakrathazhwar\\". Devotees performing this pooja will overcome their difficulties and will be blessed with wealth, prosperity, progeny and happiness in their family. =Homams= From time immemorial yagnas or homams are performed by devotees to seek the grace of the Lord and to grant happiness and prosperity to his bhaktas. A separate enclosure has been constructed at the temple for performing homams. These include * Sudarshana Homam * Lakshmi Narasimha Homam * Lakshmi Hayagrivar Homam These homams are performed every month (except in the Tamil month of Purattasi). Further details may be obtained by contacting the temple office. =Bhajans= Every month on the 2nd and 4th Saturday (except in the Tamil month of Purattasi), bhajans are performed at the temple. They sing devoutly in praise of Sriman Narayana and devotees join in the religious fervour. This is followed by annadanam. =Thirumanjanam (Abhishekam)= Thirumanjanam is performed for the mail deity (moolavar) on all Saturdays at 7.00 AM and on special days/festivals at the time fixed for the same. Thirumanjanam is performed for all the other deities/Azhwars on the 1st Friday of every Tamil month at about 9.00 AM. Devotees wishing to participate/contribute/donate for the same may contact the temple office. Festivals =Purattasi festival= This festival is celebrated with grandeur in the Tamil month of Purattasi (during September/October months) for six consecutive Saturdays. People converge at the temple from across India and overseas. During these days the temple presents a sea of humanity immersed in bhakthi for the Lord. These Saturdays at the temple begin as early as 4.00 AM with an \\"Abhishekam\\" or \\"Thiumanjanam\\" aradhanai for the Lord. The Maha Deeparadhanai is performed at noon. In the evening the Lord is taken along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi on a majestic Garuda vahanam around the four streets of the temple in a tastefully decorated floral palanquin (Pushpaka Pallaki). The unique feature of this is the bhaktas fulfilling their vows by carrying an arrow shaped \\"Meravanai\\". For generations people have been following this custom where they remit money in the name of their family members and receive this \\"Meravanai\\". They accompany the palanquin carrying it. On these days a special hundi is placed here. It is believed that devotees who wish to make their offerings to Tirupathi Balaji but who are unable visit Tirupathi Tirumala may place their offerings in this hundi to receive His blessings. The entire day is very busy with special programs, bhajans, etc. Annadanam (free feeding), is carried out throughout the day. To facilitate the transportation for pilgrims, several special buses ply from points in and around Coimbatore and nearby places on these days. =Temple Chariot festival= This festival commences in the Tamil month of Thai with the Dwajarohana the hoisting of the Garudadwaja (flag with the emblem of black Garuda). Following this, the festival is held for 11 days. The temple chariot is taken around the four streets of the temple on the day of the \\"punarpoosam\\" (punarvasa) star. On the evenings of the festival, the Lord and the consorts are taken around the streets of the temple on vahanams (vehicles) such as \\" Anna Vahanam\\" (peacock), \\"Simha Vahanam\\" (Narasimha), \\"Hanumantha Vahanam\\" (Hanuman), \\"Garuda Vahanam\\" (king of birds), \\"Pushpaka vimanam\\", \\"Yanai Vahanam\\" ( elephant), \\"Kudirai Vahanam\\" (horse), \\"Sesha Vahanam\\" (Adishesha ‚Äì Lord's serpent). Thirukalyana Uthsavam is performed the day before the car festival and \\"Theppothsavam\\" (Pushkarni or temple tank float) is performed on the day after the car festival. The Garudadwaja is then lowered. The temple wears a very festive look and thousands of devotees shouting \\"Govinda\\" throng the temple to participate in this unique festival. Other Sannathi in Temple Excluding Moolavar and Urchavar, there are Sri Venugopalan Sannathi, Sri Chakrathalwar Sannathi, Sri Anjaneyar Sannathi, Alwargal Sannathi, Sri Thumbikaialwar Sannathi, Sri Mahalakshmi Thayar Sannathi, Sri Andal Sannathi, Dasavatharam Idols, Sri Vaikunta Nathar Sannathi, Sri Saneeswaran Sannathi.

She reached the peak of her career in 1942-43, performing in Joseph Goebbels version of Titanic. After the war she was given a two-year ban by the Allies due to her role in the Nazi propaganda.Bj√∏rn-Erik Hanssen: Glamour for Goebbels Aschehoug Publishing House, Oslo 2014, p. 343 In Norway she was never punished, as she was a German citizen.Adresseavisen: Nazisten p√• Tr√∏ndelag Teater 2009, http://www.adressa.no/meninger/article1305752.ece Biography Heiberg grew up in the towns Krager√∏, Kongsberg and Oslo, and studied in Lausanne, Dijon and Paris. Later, she studied English in Oxford, England. She made her debut at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen in 1929, and in the 1930s at the Carl Johan Theater and Scala Revyteater in Oslo. Kirsten Heiberg also performed in several Norwegian and Swedish films in the early 1930s and had her breakthrough in the comedy Han, hon och pengarna (\\"He, she and the money\\") in 1936. After guest appearances in the operetta revue \\"Pam-Pam\\" at Theater an der Wien in 1937, she began a career in Germany both as a film actress and recording artist. She became a significant actress in the German film industry and The Third Reich's femme fatale - the \\"new Marlene Dietrich\\". In Vienna, she met the composer Franz Grothe, who was a member of the Nazi PartyCopy of Franz Grothe's membership book in the NSDAP, Bundesarchiv Lichterfelde, Berlin. They married in Oslo in 1938 and moved to Berlin. Kirsten Heiberg made her German film debut in Curt Goetz' Napoleon Is to Blame for Everything, and a row of films followed, among others: Frauen f√ºr Golden Hill (1938), Achtung! Feind h√∂rt mit! (1940) and Titanic (1942‚Äì43). Kirsten Heiberg was also very active in the German welfare for the troops (Truppenbetreuung), traveling around the country, also abroad, singing for the German soldiers.Referred by Heiberg herself in a radio interview in December 1940. Norwegian Broadcasting archive, program dated 22. of December 1940. Kirsten Heiberg claimed after the war that she was black listed by German Nazi authorities for not joining the Nazi Party, and that she spent two years without work. However, there is no evidence in German archive sources to prove this. On the contrary, Kirsten Heiberg's name can be found on the salary lists of the German film industry every year from April 1940, when she got her Reichsfilmkammer membership, until 1945.Bj√∏rn-Erik Hanssen: Glamour for Goebbels Aschehoug Publishing House, Oslo 2014, p. 475 Kirsten Heiberg was also, since April 1939, a member of the Kameradschaft der deutschen K√ºnstler, an organisation for artists founded by the SS member Benno von Arent in 1933.Mitgliederverzeichnis (Membership list) KddK, August 1940, Deutsches Nationalbibliothek, Leipzig. Kirsten Heiberg continued to act in the German Nazi propaganda until she left Berlin with her husband Franz Grothe at the end of April 1945. In 1946 she dubbed Marlene Dietrich in the German version of the French picture Martin Roumaniac. She was the sister of actress Else Heiberg. =After World War II= Back in Norway after the war, she met great difficulty in finding roles due to her time in Germany during the war. However, she was not arrested by the Norwegians since she still was a German citizen, her marriage to Franz Grothe having not been formally annulled.Bj√∏rn-Erik Hanssen: Glamour for Goebbels, Aschehoug Publishing House, Oslo 2014, p. 369 In Germany, she was seen in four films after the war. In Trondheim, she got an engagement as a resident at Tr√∏ndelag Teater 1952-60, acting in operettas, comedies, and serious classics and modern dramas. She also sporadically appeared at the Oslo scene in the 1960s and 70s, but she faced a boycott in Oslo, and never again was given a steady job at any theatre or film company.Bj√∏rn-Erik Hanssen: Glamour for Goebbels, Aschehoug Publishing House, Oslo 2014, p. 452 Legacy On 15 August 2008, the premiere was held of the monologue \\"Glamour for Goebbels\\" at Haugesund Teater as part of the film festival.

He served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary Wars. Molloy rose through the ranks to command a number of ships during the war with America, and saw action in most of the naval engagements of the conflict, both off the North American coast and in the Caribbean. He commanded several ships during the peace that followed, and after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, he served with the fleet in the Atlantic. He was part of Lord Howe's fleet at the Glorious First of June, but was sharply criticised by Howe in the aftermath. Molloy was then tried by court martial for failing to obey orders, or to do his utmost to engage the enemy. The charges were subsequently proved and Molloy was dismissed from his ship. Molloy's personal life was later the subject of some speculation, with rumours that he had acted dishonourably to a woman, who had then cursed him, resulting in his disgrace at the Glorious First of June. He married a daughter of Admiral Sir John Laforey, but it was imputed that his weak nature on the battlefield extended to his house, and that he was dominated by his wife. He died in 1814 at the age of 60, having never again served at sea. Early years and American War of Independence Molloy was born c. 1754 and embarked on a naval career. He was the nephew of another Royal Navy officer, Thomas Pye, who later became an admiral. He rose through the ranks and was promoted to his first commands during the American War of Independence, commanding the bomb vessel HMS Thunder off North America from June 1776. He was with Peter Parker's squadron at the Battle of Sullivan's Island on 28 June 1776, and was succeeded as commander of Thunder by Commander James Gambier in April 1778. Molloy was promoted to post-captain on 11 April 1778, and given command of the 64-gun , flying the broad pennant of Commodore John Elliot. Trident sailed for North America on 16 April, and Molloy was present with Lord Howe's force at Sandy Hook on 22 July 1778, where the comte d'Estaing was successfully repulsed without an action being fought. Molloy was present at Howe's next encounter with the comte d'Estaing, during the Battle of Rhode Island in August that year, and on Elliot's return to Britain in December, Molloy took Trident to join Vice-Admiral John Byron's forces in the West Indies. Trident was part of Byron's fleet at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779 and then at the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780. Molloy followed this up with service in the two actions off St Lucia on 15 and 19 May 1780, before handing over Trident to Captain John Thomas. Molloy's next ship was the 64-gun , which he commissioned in 1781. He was with Sir George Brydges Rodney during the Dutch West Indies campaign in early 1781, and was present at the capture of Sint Eustatius on 3 February, and at the Battle of Fort Royal on 29/30 April. He returned to North America with Sir Samuel Hood's fleet, and was present at the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. Molloy was commended for his efforts during the battle, being described as having 'behaved most gallantly', and for having assisted . Molloy returned to the West Indies with Hood, arriving there on 5 December 1781. He took part in the Battle of St. Kitts on 25 and 26 January 1782. Having served in many of the naval engagements of the American War of Independence, Molloy sailed to Jamaica in May that year, and then back to Britain with a convoy, where he paid Intrepid off in August. Peace Molloy commissioned the 74-gun as the Chatham guardship in March 1783, and remained with her until 1785, when she was moved to Plymouth. He is recorded as commissioning the 74-gun in October 1787, though she was paid off again in December 1787. He briefly commanded the Plymouth guardship, the 74-gun , until she was paid off to be fitted for sea again the following year. His last command during the peace was the 74-gun , which he recommissioned in December 1792. French Revolutionary Wars Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June, Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg, 1795 Molloy and Ganges were part of the fleet under Lord Howe which encountered and then pursued Pierre Jean Van Stabel's squadron in the Atlantic on 18 November 1793. Molloy left Ganges in late 1793, commissioning the newly built 80-gun in December that year. Molloy was attached to Lord Howe's fleet, hunting for the French convoys during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. When the French fleet, under Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, was sighted, Howe ordered an attack, with Molloy leading the column into battle at the Glorious First of June. Caesar sustained casualties of 18 men killed and 71 wounded, but in the aftermath Molloy was strongly criticised by Howe for failing to obey orders and break the French line. Court martial Accordingly a court martial was convened aboard at Portsmouth on 28 April 1795, and Molloy was charged with '[his failure to] cross the enemy's line, in obedience to the signal of the admiral', and 'that he did not use his utmost endeavours to close with and defeat the enemy'. Speaking for the prosecution was Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, the captain of the fleet during the battle. Molloy argued that the ship had been thrown into confusion after a ball had struck the stern-beam and left her unmanageable, but after three weeks of deliberations, the charges were found to have been proved. The court tempered the findings with the observation that his courage was unimpeachable, but nevertheless he was sentenced to be dismissed from his ship. Family and later life Molloy never again held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, one of the daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to circulate that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her to bring an action for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon she said to him \\"Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!\\" Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed to be the result of her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: > I, Anthony James Pye Molloy > Can burn, take, sink and destroy; > There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life! > And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife. Molloy died at Cheltenham on 25 July 1814, having sustained a fall down some stairs at Montpelier House and injured his back. He was 60 years old. Notes a. President of the court martial was Admiral Joseph Peyton, with Vice-Admirals Sir Richard King and Charles Buckner, Rear-Admiral John Colpoys, and Captains Francis Parry, Charles Powell Hamilton, Alexander Graeme, Charles M Pole, Christopher Parker, Lord Charles FitzGerald, Andrew Mitchell, Sir Erasmus Gower and James Richard Dacres.

The river is commonly called the \\"River of Five Colors\\" or the \\"Liquid Rainbow,\\" and is noted for its striking colors. The bed of the river from the end of July through November is variously colored yellow, green, blue, black, and especially red, the last caused by Macarenia clavigera plants (family Podostemaceae) on the riverbed. History Over the years some have said the river is one of the most beautiful on earth. National Geographic quotes that the river seems to have been from \\"The Garden of Eden\\" (). Geology The quartzite rocks of the Serrania de la Macarena tableland formed approximately 1.2 billion years ago. They are a western extension of the Guiana Shield of Venezuela. Ca√±o Cristales is a fast-flowing river with many rapids and waterfalls. Small circular pits known as giant's kettles can be found in many parts of the riverbed, which have been formed by pebbles or chunks of harder rocks. Once one of these harder rock fragments falls into one of the cavities, it is rotated by the water current and begins to carve at the cavity wall, increasing the dimensions of the pit. Fauna and flora Macarenia clavigera The Serran√≠a de la Macarena is located on the border of three large ecosystems, each of them with high diversity of flora and fauna: the Andes, the Eastern Llanos, and the Amazon rainforest. Plant and animal life are struggling with the lack of nutrients on the solid rock surface of the tableland and have developed diverse adaptations. The representative biome of the Serran√≠a de La Macarena is the hydrophytic rainforest: hot, warm, and cold. The tableland is home to about 420 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians, 43 species of reptiles, and eight primates. Ca√±o Cristales river has a wide variety of aquatic plants. The water of the river is extremely clear due to the lack of nutrients and small particles. Almost unique is the bright red - pink coloration of riverbed after the rainy period in the end of June - November. This color is caused by great quantities of endemic plant species Macarenia clav√≠gera. This plant is found in some more local rivers, such as the Ca√±o Siete Machos. These red plants adhere tightly to rocks in places where the river has faster current.

The Age. Retrieved 9 August 2010. One of the first actions of Reid's new Board was to sack coach Dennis Jones, who had been in the position for only a year.Sheahan, Michael (29 November 1978). \\"Demons coach to be axed?\\". The Age. Retrieved 9 August 2010. He appointed Carl Ditterich as captain-coach to replace Jones. Reid held the position of president for two years, until he resigned at the end of the 1980 season and Billy Snedden took over the presidency. Reid was approached by five clubs to contest the 1988 election for president of the Victorian Football League, but he decided against running after learning that Allen Aylett, who became president, was intending to run.  Further presidencies  He was also the inaugural president of the Confederation of Australian Sport, a position he held for eight years. In March 1981 he was elected president of the International Assembly of National Confederations of Sports, a position he also held for eight years.Perkin, Corrie (27 March 1981). \\"Reid reaches top in international sports\\".

There is a portrait drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger in the Royal Collection and an oil portrait after the same artist based on the drawing in the National Portrait Gallery, London. One further portrait also exists after Holbein. Life He was the eldest son of Sir Anthony Poyntz (1480?‚Äì1533), vice-admiral, and his first wife Elizabeth Huddefield. His uncle was John Poyntz. On Saturday 21 August 1535, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn visited Nicholas Poyntz at Acton Court, Iron Acton, Gloucestershire. Poyntz had built a special new lodging for his royal guests which still survives. It contained three first floor state rooms and one of these still has painted decoration by an artist of the Tudor court. These state rooms connected to the older house by a covered walkway called a 'pentice.' Archaeological excavations found fragments of precious Venetian glass and maiolica which Nicholas probably bought for the visit. The evidence of lengthy preparations by Nicholas at Acton shows that Henry's progress in the west of England was planned in advance.Bell, Robert, in Starkey, David, ed., Henry VIII, A European Court in England (BCA, 1991), pp. 118-125. In 1539 and 1545 he served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and in 1547 represented Gloucestershire in Parliament as a Knight of the Shire. Between 1544 and 1556 Poyntz built as a hunting lodge Newark Park, near the village of Ozleworth, Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. This was built at about the same time as nearby Siston Court was being built by Sir Maurice Denys (d.1563), first cousin of Poyntz's wife Jane Berkeley. He was elected MP for Cricklade in 1555. During the war of the Rough Wooing with Scotland (1543‚Äì1550), Poyntz commanded the warship the Great Galley.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 19, part 1 (London, 1903), no. 264.

They are known commonly as gliders.Van Velzen, R., et al. (2009). A new hidden species of the Cymothoe caenis-complex (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) from western Africa. Zootaxa 2197, 53-63. The genus is distributed in the Afrotropical realm, where species are found mainly in forest habitat. mainly in the Guinean Forests of West Africa and the Congolian forests. Description These are medium-large to large-size (wingspan 40-70 millimetres) often quite colourful butterflies. Species in this genus exhibit a number of different colours and patterns. Among the most remarkable are a number of species where the upperside is solid coloured bright red or orange. Another group is largely pale yellow; others deep ochreous yellow and chocolate brown or pure white. Biology The larvae feed on various shrubs and trees. Recorded host genera include Rawsonia and Kiggelaria (Achariaceae), Fernandoa and Kigelia (Bignoniaceae), Vismia (Hypericaceae), Dovyalis (Salicaceae) and Rinorea (Violaceae). The adults spend most of their time in the canopy but also seek out sunlit spots between the trees and feed on decaying vegetation on the forest floor. Taxonomy These butterflies exhibit sexual dimorphism. Individuals can also be variable within a species, especially females. The females of C. caenis, for example, are so variable that authorities have described 20 different forms of the species based on their differences. The sister genus is Harma. The type species of the genus is Papilio althea Cramer. Species groups Defining species groups is a convenient way of subdividing well-defined genera with a large number of recognized species. Cymothoe species are so arranged in assemblages called \\"species groups\\" but (not superspecies, but an informal phenetic arrangement). These may or may not be clades. As molecular phylogenetic studies continue, lineages distinct enough to warrant some formal degree of recognition become evident and new groupings are suggested, but consistent ranking remains a problem.

It is set in Timbuktu (Africa), but was filmed in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Kanab, Utah. Plot In 1940, France is at war with Germany. The French have removed large numbers of troops from their African possessions, leaving the way open for revolt. American soldier of fortune Mike Conway (Victor Mature) sees a chance to pay his way back to the United States by gunrunning to hostile Tuaregs. Wearing a slouch hat and bush jacket, Conway is armed with a Thompson sub machine gun and a wristwatch with an alarm engraved \\"From Conway to Conway\\". He finds himself walking a razor's edge between an anti-French Tuareg leader (John Dehner) keen for Conway's supply of weapons but keener to use his tarantulas on his prisoners, a moderate Imam (Leonard Mudie) wanting peace, the local French Foreign Legion commander (George Dolenz), and the commander's attractive wife (Yvonne de Carlo) who Conway cannot keep away from.

Production The film was originally meant to be shot on location in colour and widescreen based on an idea of Small and Frank Cavett with Stuart Heisler to direct. Later, there was a script done by Horace McCoy. At one stage, the film was going to be made by the team of Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse, who were making films for Small. In 1956 producer Edward Small registered several titles for the film, including: East of Timbuktu, West of Timbuktu, North of Timbuktu, South of Timbuktu (a technique of titling films that William Witney described as \\"boxing the compass\\"), The Road to Timbuktu, and Timbuktu Theme. However, he eventually settled on the plain title Timbuktu. In 1957, Anthony Veillier signed to write a script. Mature signed in February 1958. Filming started May 1958 in Kanab, Utah. Parts of the film were shot in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. Director Jacques Tourneur claimed that producer Small thought the film was not long enough so he inserted reaction shots of close-ups of various actors all throughout the film. Edward Small felt so embarrassed by the film that he removed his name from the final credits.Fujiwara, Chris Jacques Tourneur: The Cinema of Nightfall McFarland p.263 References External links * Category:1959 films Category:United Artists films Category:1959 adventure films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Films shot in Utah Category:Films directed by Jacques Tourneur Category:Films set in 1940 Category:Films about jihadism Category:Tuareg rebellions Category:French Foreign Legion in popular culture Category:Timbuktu Category:Films set in Mali Category:Films set in the French colonial empire Category:Films scored by Gerald Fried Category:Films produced by Edward Small ","title":"Timbuktu (1959 film)"},{"id":"28306729","text":"Cymothoe alcimeda, the battling glider, is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.

Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2015, , S. 43 Research of the Sarasins was primarily in the field of natural science: they collected geographical informations and also informations and objects related to Geology and Zoology (like Molluscs). Later, getting interested additionally in anthropology and ethnology, they collected also measures about the human body, they photographed and interviewed people, recorded their language and collected their works of art. Paul and Fritz Sarasin made several scientific expeditions to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Celebes (now Sulawesi). After their first journey to Ceylon 1883-1886 they stayed 1886-1893 in Berlin for evaluation and publication of results. 1890, 1902 and 1907 they travelled again to Ceylon and 1893-1896 to Celebes. After staying from 1896-1902 in Basel they went from 1902-1903 a second time to Celebes. In Celebes they tried to solve an open scientific question related to the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, about a detail concerned with the geographical distribution of plants and animals called the Wallace Line, that is whether Celebes belonged in this regard more to Asia or to Australia.Bernhard C. Sch√§r: Tropenliebe. Schweizer Naturforscher und niederl√§ndischer Imperialismus in S√ºdostasien um 1900. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2015, , S. 195 ff. A network of scientists publishing in English, German, French and Dutch competed for a solution to this problem.Bernhard C. Sch√§r: Tropenliebe. Schweizer Naturforscher und niederl√§ndischer Imperialismus in S√ºdostasien um 1900. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2015, , S. 204 ff. Instead of a sharp line the Sarasins proposed a zone of gradual change and asked for research about the kind of connections of land which would explain the existing populations.Bernhard C. Sch√§r: Tropenliebe. Schweizer Naturforscher und niederl√§ndischer Imperialismus in S√ºdostasien um 1900. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2015, , p. 214. In the context of the question of the origin and evolution of man Wallace had proposed a second line, hence called Wallace's other line east of the first line, separating two distinct groups of men: the Malay people in the West and the Papuan people in the East. To clarify this problem the Sarasins explored different groups and tribes in Cylon and Celebes, which they saw as varieties of men created differently by evolution and at different stages of biological and cultural development.Bernhard C. Sch√§r: Tropenliebe. Schweizer Naturforscher und niederl√§ndischer Imperialismus in S√ºdostasien um 1900. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2015, , p. 231ff, 278ff. In Ceylon they visited and studied intensively a tribe called Weddas which they considered to be the oldest and original population of Ceylon, living mostly as hunters in the mountains and inner parts of Ceylon. They compared them to other groups in Ceylon, the Tamils and the Sinhalese. Later the Sarasins found a group of people in Celebes, in their opinion similar to the Weddas, the Toala and Toraja.Eduard His: Basler Gelehrte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Benno Schwabe & Co., Basel 1941, S. 367 - 369. For their research the Sarasins crossed Celebes seven times on different routes. Since the island was at this time only loosely controlled by the colonial administration of the Netherlands, they had to travel through mostly unknown areas of the nearly independent kingdoms of Luwu, Sidenreng and Bone. These kingdoms belonged to the cultural groups named Bugis or Makassars. Hierarchically structured, each with a king on top, elected by noble families, and an associated parliament of lower nobles, they competed for power and resources, like slaves, to produce coffee and spices, which they sold to the world-market. Lower groups of the Bugis and tribes from the inner mountainous parts of Celebes, like the Toraja, lived in a kind of slavery.

The Army and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) were unable to reach agreement on the ship's specifications and the project was cancelled in the early 1970s. History In the late 1960s, the Australian Army saw a need to replace its four World War II-era Landing Ship Medium (LSM) which had been purchased from the United States in 1959.Alsop (1996), p. 65 In response to this requirement, the firm Burness, Corlett and Partners, along with the Australian Shipbuilding Board, drew up plans for a ship which was larger than the LSM and was capable of carrying a greater quantity of cargo. The resulting design included three engines and a long, slim hull, and later versions of the plans included a helicopter pad. The ship would be capable of embarking tanks in an enclosed tank deck or on the upper deck with other cargo, and specialised storage areas would be included for refrigerated, explosive and flammable supplies.Gillett (1988), p. 125 The Army and RAN disagreed on aspects of the Landing Ship Medium Mark II's design. Unlike other contemporary designs, it was planned that the ship would not carry smaller landing craft, but rather discharge her cargo via a ramp fitted to her bow. While the Army wanted the ship to have a bow door to enable her to be beached, the navy preferred a fully sealed bow so that she could make and sail in convoys. These differing views were not resolved, and the design team experienced problems meeting the Army's requirements. As a result of the difficulties with the project, the Landing Ship Medium Mark II was cancelled in the early 1970s. Instead, the Army ordered eight Balikpapan-class landing craft heavy to replace the LSMs. Only the first of these ships actually served with the Army, however, as responsibility for seagoing ships was transferred to the RAN shortly after she entered service.

The current building was opened in 1913 and it is one of the oldest continuously running cinemas in the UK. It is an example of the many purpose-built cinemas that followed the regulations set by the Cinematograph Act 1909. It is distinctive in the local area due to its fa√ßade outlined in red neon, along with a large canopy used for advertising current and upcoming films and events. Since 2008, the cinema has been operated by Everyman Cinemas Group, who have expanded their interests into a unique premium cinemas across London (including the original Everyman Cinema in Hampstead), Surrey and Hampshire. Now retitled as 'Everyman Screen on the Green', the cinema offers a variety of films and special events, including the National Theatre Live, live Q&As;, film festivals and seasons. The venue is equipped with Sony Digital 4K projectors and Dolby Digital surround sound. History =Early history and foundation (1910‚Äì1913)= Cinematic entertainment began at number 83 Upper Street, Islington when the Pesaresi brothers ran their original animated picture show in the then vacant shop. After success, and gaining financial assistance from Thomas Harrold who ran the \\"fancy drapery\\" store next door at number 82, they bought out Stean's Printers, Fosdykes' Confectionery and Vivian Lester's Sign Writers, numbers 84 to 86 respectively. They demolished the old shops and built a new purpose-built electric theatre designed by architects Boreham & Gladding, which opened in October 1913. =The Empress Picture Theatre (1913‚Äì1951)= Renamed from The Empress Electric Theatre shortly after opening, the new cinema seated 600 on a single floor. It was originally considered very smart, though by the late 1930s it had become tatty and was compared unfavourably with the new picture palaces of the time. It was however cheap and remained very popular with local children. =The Rex (1951‚Äì1970)= The Empress was closed, refurbished and re-opened in December 1951 as The Rex. Its capacity was reduced slightly to 514 http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=471 and a new single seat pricing policy was introduced, initially all seats being 1s 9d. The reopening ceremony included a fanfare of trumpets from the Islington Air Training Corps. In the early sixties the cinema ran regular film shows for the local Turkish population. The films were specially flown over from Turkey and shown without subtitles. In the late sixties the local Greek community organised Greek language film shows which ran every Sunday. The Rex closed on 20 June 1970. =The Screen On The Green (1970‚Äìpresent)= The cinema re-opened on 13 September 1970 as The Screen On The Green after being purchased by Romaine Hart's Mainline Pictures Group. It was comprehensively refurbished and modernised in February 1981 to plans by architect Fletcher Priest, one of the main modifications being the creation of foyer space, something the original building never had. This reduced the seating capacity to 300. It was operated as part of the small independent Screen Cinemas circuit until 2008, when the circuit was sold to the Everyman Media Group. In December 2009 the cinema underwent its third major refurbishment, the main change being the addition of a full size bar within the auditorium space. The seating was also replaced, the new seats being flanked by plush two-seater sofas with footrests, sold at a premium. It has retained the charm of its original barrel vault ceiling, its iconic working red curtain, and the exterior, which is especially noticeable at night due to its neon outline and sign.http://www.everymancinema.com/cinemas/screen- on-the-green/gallery Image Gallery of the new interior Live events Aside from films, the cinema is probably most widely known for its 'Midnight Special' on Sunday 29 August 1976 when The Clash and Buzzcocks supported The Sex Pistols in a showcase event organised by Malcolm Maclaren. This was notable for many reasons including, it was only The Clash's third gig and the first ever to be recorded, and is the earliest known (after the Manchester Free Trade Hall concert from April 1976) recorded performance and a rare recording of The Sex Pistols with Glen Matlock. The Screen On The Green was also the location for the first performance of Sid Vicious with the Sex Pistols, on April 3, 1977, following the dismissal of Matlock from the band.Recorded by Don Letts and included in Letts' Punk Rock Movie (1978). The cinema is referenced throughout Adam and the Ants' song \\"Fall in\\" - released as the b side to \\"Ant Music\\" in 1980. The Screen On The Green's 2009 refurbishment included the addition of a full-size stage in front of the screen, making the venue more suitable for live events. Since then the cinema has hosted award-winning comedy from Stewart Lee, Stephen K Amos and Phill Jupitus amongst others.

Her performances around the world have helped to promote the unusual musical instrument. Biography Carolina Eyck in the Jazz club \\"Telegraph\\" German- born musician and composer Carolina Eyck is one of the world‚Äôs foremost theremin virtuosi. After her debut with the Berlin Philharmonic, she was invited to the Bohuslav Martinu International Music Festival in Basel, the Davos Festival (Switzerland), the Konzerthaus Berlin, the Gro√ües Festspielhaus Salzburg (Austria), the Teatro Nacional Lisbon (Portugal) and the Palace of Arts Budapest. She has given concerts in Poland, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Sweden, Finland, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Mexico, Chile, Portugal, Hungary, Pakistan, Turkey and the United States. During her concert tours, Eyck has collaborated with other musicians and orchestras including Heinz Holliger, Robert Kolinsky, Gerhard Oppitz, Andrey Boreyko, Michael Sanderling, G√ºrer Aykal, John Storg√•rds, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Bern Symphony Orchestra, the Essen Philharmonic Orchestra, the Brandenburg State Orchestra, the Stuttgart Philharmonic Orchestra, the Lapland Chamber Orchestra, the Heidelberg Symphonic Orchestra and the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg.

Since 2010 she has been the artistic director of the Theremin Summer Academy in Colmar, France, and has since conducted workshops, lectures and master classes worldwide. Also in 2006 Eyck was the winner of the International Competition for Composers arranged by Radio/TV Berlin- Brandenburg in 2006.

On 14 August 2020, Eyck appeared on the BBC Radio 3 programme In Tune to discuss the theremin. During the show, she performed an excerpt from the self-composed tribute piece Friend as well as a complete version of the Doctor Who theme, the latter of which was recorded on video.
