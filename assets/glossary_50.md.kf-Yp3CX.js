In 2015, Ultra Mobile was ranked number #1 on Inc. magazine's list of the 5,000 fastest growing private companies in the United States, with a year-over-year growth rate of 100,849% and revenues of US$118 million in 2014, up from less than a million in 2012. As of 2016, Ultra Mobile was available in over 25,000 retail stores in the US, including Target and 7-Eleven. In 2017, the company offered unlimited calling to 75 countries, and access to over 200 countries. The company's business model is based on selling Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards which can be used with prepaid plans on unlocked phones. This contrasts to selling long-term contracts with a free or discounted locked phone, a model which is currently more prevalent in the US than in other parts of the world. The Ultra Mobile was co-founded by CEO David Glickman, who has previously founded companies such as TelePacific Communications, Justice Technology, and Primo Connect. In 2017, the company had approximately 150 employees across the US, Europe, and Asia, and has focused on hiring millennials. Brands Ultra Mobile is the company's flagship brand, which offers broad international calling plans targeted to diasporic communities in the United States, with the company specifically targeting people born outside of the US. In January 2016, the company acquired rights from Univision Communications to manage the Univision Mobile brand, another T-Mobile MVNO partner which specializes in US SIM-based international calling plans for calls to Latin American countries. In May 2017, Ultra Mobile announced that it was closing down the Univision Mobile brand and that it would automatically transfer all Univision Mobile subscribers over to Ultra Mobile. In August 2016, Ultra Mobile launched Mint Mobile, formerly Mint SIM, an online-only MVNO specializing in prepaid mobile plans on the T-Mobile cellular network, which provides discounted pricing based on monthly, quarterly, or yearly terms paid in advance. In October 2019, Mint Mobile started operating as their own company to serve customers as Mint Mobile LLC, which is separate from Ultra Mobile. On November 25, 2019, it was announced that actor Ryan Reynolds had purchased an ownership stake in Mint Mobile.https://bestmvno.com/mint-sim/mint-mobile-sells-ownership-stake-to- actor-ryan-reynolds/ References Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Mobile virtual network operators Category:Internet service providers of the United States Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States Category:Companies based in California ","title":"Ultra Mobile"},{"id":"53558916","text":"The Naguanagua Botanical GardenJard√≠n Bot√°nico de Naguanagua (), also known as Bachiller Jos√© Saer D'Eguert Botanical Garden, is a botanical garden located south of the city of Naguanagua, Carabobo State in the South American country of Venezuela.

It is a multiple day festival that consists of music, art, food and fashion events that take place along Wellington Avenue. The main hub is The Somerset Square Park with the other locations being the local galleries and caf√©s. The festival's mandate is to showcase the works of local artists, musicians and businesses. Hintonburg Happening thrives off of the enthusiasm of local residents, generous sponsors, and the help of dedicated volunteers as they have no paid employees. The co- founder of the Hintonburg Happening is Summer Baird. She is also the owner of the Hintoburg Public House and was named one of the 40 under 40 in the Ottawa Business Journal. As a part of this year's 2017 festival she is organizing the Art Throw Down, Beer Garden and finances.  2017  This year the festival is occurring over 3 days from May 3‚Äì6. They have forty-one different locations for events including Cube Gallery, Railbender Studio, Malenka Originals, Ola Cocina, Wabi Sabi, Hintonburger, Parkdale Food Center, and more. They will each be hosting an array of \\"happenings\\" such as live music shows, art shows, colourblock parties and various workshops. Although the big Park pARTy usually occurs in the Somerset Park, this year they are expanding and the party will be appropriately happening at Hintonburg Park. It will be happening on My 6th from 1 to 10 P.M. This year's sponsors include Wellington West BIA, Desjardins, the Hintonburg Public House, Character Creative and CHUO 89.1 FM.  2016  In 2016, the festival ran from May 6‚Äì14 with the closing party in Somerset Square on May 14. There were twenty-four different locations for events including Twiss and Weber, Beyond the Pale, Bread By Us, Mint Hair Studio, Maker House Co., and more. They each held unique events such as weaving workshops, floral pop ups, live music and live street art. This year's sponsors were Tamarack Wellington, HP Urban, the Hintonburg Public House, Beau's Brewery, Postering Ottawa, MASC and the Wellington West BIA. There were two grants given this year that helped create projects that will be displayed during the Happening in 2017. The first grant was awarded to Daniel Martelock who, with the money, created the project \\"Tying Our Community Together\\". This will be a permanent installation made with nails and wire on wood shaping the outline of Wellington West. It will be installed in the Ottawa Bagelshop and Deli. The next grant was awarded to Shanima Puppet Players which is a company which includes Anne Bourgault, Monica Bradford-Lea and Sheree Bradford-Lea. During the Happening 2017, there will be three puppets, ranging at about four feet tall, that will be walking around the neighbourhood meeting the festival goers and performing sketches.  2015  By the second year, the Hintonburg Happening had gained a huge following within the community. It occurred over the span of the first week of May. This year's sponsors included Tamarack Wellington, Beau's Brewery and Wellington West BIA. There were two art grants given this year, one for music and one for visual arts. The 2015 music grant winner was the band \\"Tilda\\". The members of this band include Michael Peterson on guitar and vocals, Andrew Long on bass and vocals, Bruce Aleya on percussion, Tom Thompson on pedal steel and guitars and finally, Nicolas Dyson on trumpet. With the grant money, the band decided to finish recording an album that was released in 2016. The second art grant was awarded to Daniel Martelock and Craig O‚ÄôBrien, two local artists who have a passion for birds. They used the grant money to create a collection of personalized bird houses for different businesses around the neighbourhood.  2014  In Spring 2014, the first ever Hintonburg Happening occurred as a nine-day festival from June 21 to June 29. There were twenty-one exhibits, demonstrations, workshops and other events over the course of the festival. Seeing as Ottawa's summers are packed with popular festivals, this new one had much competition with Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival, Glow Fair and Rock Fest. The launch party on June 21 included performances by the Death Bob Trip free jazz band, the 613 Casual Choir, Brad Morgan and Peter Joynt. There was one artist grant given during the festival's first year which was awarded to Shawn MacDonell. With this grant money he created the project \\"Air Your Dirty Laundry\\" which was a social project concentrated around the idea of mental health. During the festival, people were asked to write their \\"dirty little secrets\\" on underwear and T-shirts which were then placed around the neighbourhood in multiple popular locations.

For the first four seasons, she is the top female special agent of the intelligence agency ISIS (International Secret Intelligence Service), working at the agency's main headquarters in New York City, during the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union. After ISIS is shut down by the FBI, Lana takes on new roles as an unlicensed P.I., and later is imagined as a nightclub singer/undercover treasury agent by Archer while he is comatose. Lana has aspirations for advancement as a master spy and has considered positions offered by ODIN, both at their international headquarters and as Regional Director for the Americas, although her strong views often cause friction between her and her job. Attributes =Background= As a child, Lana was highly pressured by her parents, who were both college professors, to succeed. She was so nervous about going to science fairs that it led to her throwing up in the car. Lana got her job as an ISIS agent during a protest at a local furrier. She was about to throw red paint on Malory Archer's new fur when Malory pointed her gun at Lana's forehead. The rest of the protesters fled, including Joshua Gray, but Lana was not intimidated. Malory, impressed by her nerve, offered Lana a job. Three weeks later, she was on her first mission in Tunisia \\"killing a different man,\\" referencing that she restructured her priorities from being a college protester (sticking it to \\"the man\\") to who she is now. =Personality= Lana is strong-willed and tough, rarely if ever allowing herself to be pushed around or demeaned. She is, however, very short- tempered and does not hesitate to use violence to resolve conflictive situations, whether it's called for or not. Lana is a competent and deadly agent but is constantly frustrated that she is treated as the number two ISIS field agent because Archer's mother runs the agency. Like Archer, Lana is an expert in Krav Maga, in which all ISIS agents undergo training, and is usually seen carrying two Tec-9 submachine guns in shoulder holsters (her proficiency is disputed, as one example has her being able to write letters in cursive with her guns, while another episode has a former ISIS trainee mock her firing style as \\"spray and pray\\"). She drives a purple car that resembles a Living Daylights-era Aston Martin V8 Vantage. Lana also has incredibly large and strong hands, which have been (usually mockingly) likened by Archer and other characters to cricket bats, steam shovels, and the \\"Truckasaurus\\" to her ever- mounting frustration. Her liberal leanings do occasionally show, and she tends to be the most politically correct character on the show, as well as the straight man to the antics of the rest of the staff. However, she is shown to be as capable of questionable behavior as the rest, once charging every man in the ISIS office $600 to say they slept with her as a way to get revenge on her cheating ex-boyfriend Cyril, and on another occasion holding up a firefight on a space station until the other agents conceded her breasts are still perfect. She is also shown to be prone to mistakes, having once forgetting to get a receipt for a captured criminal, thus costing ISIS a massive bounty. Furthermore, in a moment of surprising insight, Cheryl accused Lana of being a hypocrite as her history as a social activist is not enough to drive her away from ISIS, which is deep down her only true love. She is also prone to extreme acts of unnecessary violence, such as giving Cyril, whom she was dating at the time, a black eye for merely implying that she might have been jealous of a rival agent. =Characteristics= Lana is one of the most recognizable characters from Archer because of her stunning good looks and body. Lana has large hands for a woman. Ridiculing her for this characteristic is one of many long-running jokes on the show, with such comments as \\"man hands\\" or \\"shovels\\". In flashbacks, she is shown sporting an afro, a hairstyle that, according to Archer, made her look \\"like Angela Davis had a love child with Sweet Lou Dunbar.\\" She eventually straightened her hair and grew it long enough to wear it in a tied back flip hairstyle. In season seven, she began wearing a hair weave, which she does not like the others noticing. Relationships =Relationship with Archer= Despite having a great disdain for Archer, Lana shares the closest connection with him of all the characters. They're frequently partnered together on missions, and despite all he has put her through, she still considers him a friend (Heart of Archness: Part III) and cares about him deeply. During a firefight, both Archer and Lana reveal they are each other's beneficiaries should they die. Lana stated she was going to change that, but it's unknown if she did. Lana showed great concern for Archer when he was diagnosed with breast cancer (Stage Two) and spent the night with him out of pity. After Archer found out his cancer medication was fake, Lana begrudgingly accompanied him in his \\"rampage\\", serving as his cameraman and chauffeuse, and is also convinced into pity sex with Archer. Lana began contemplating having a baby in Season 4. during one episode, she becomes conflicted as to who is going to be the unaware sperm donor for her, Archer or Cyril, seemingly changing her mind many times. During a mission to stop a radical environmentalist marine biologist from blowing up Sealab, Lana discloses that she is pregnant, angering Cyril because he isn't the father and prompting Archer to sacrifice his scuba gear and drown so that they could escape. In Season 6, Lana and Archer renew their relationship as Lana realizes how much more mature and caring Archer has become, even with some of his faults continuing, but she shows more trust in him, and especially enjoys the sexual connection they now have. =Relationship with Cyril= For the beginning of Season 1, Lana has a relationship with Cyril Figgis, though she seems to question the relationship at times, considering Cyril to be \\"clingy\\" (so much so, she once commented to Malory, \\"Saran Wrap could take a lesson.\\"), she still endures the relationship, until it becomes obvious that Cyril is insecure about their relationship, egged on by Pam and Carol, who suggest Lana is still sexually attracted to Archer, causing Cyril to constantly follow her on missions, finally frustrating Lana to where she declares them \\"on a break\\". Cyril tries to propose to Lana to prove his trust in her, but he's forced to sacrifice the engagement ring for a jury-rigged device to save her. Later, their relationship goes south again when Lana finds out that Cyril, out of his insecurity, slept with several women at ISIS, causing her to supposedly sleep with other men at ISIS (in reality, she just has each of them pay $600 to say they did), and officially ends their relationship. In Season 4, Lana, wishing to have a child, resumes her relationship with Cyril, considering him as a sperm donor for her pregnancy. This continues until in one episode, she and Archer pose as newlyweds for a stake-out, and Cyril is once again made insecure by Pam and Carol about her not falling for Archer and shadows them, and though he ends up saving them, Lana finally has enough of Cyril's lack of trust and ends their relationship again, as well as his status as a possible \\"donor\\" for her. =Marriage= In Season 11, it's revealed that Lana married in the three year period when Archer was in a coma, to Robert Kane, a billionaire philanthropist who Archer notes is balding and much older than her. They met at a charity auction eight months after Archer was in a coma. This seems to devastate Archer, who was ready to propose to Lana, pointing out that every coma dream he had, had Lana as a center point for him. Pam has commented to Archer that Lana is genuinely happy in her marriage.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Description The eclipse was visible in much of the South Island and the southernmost portion of North Island around Wellington in New Zealand, it was also visible in all of Antarctica (much of the areas had a 24-hour daylight), South America's Patagonia and Oceanian islands such as Macquarrie, Chatham, Antipodes, Tahiti and Tuamotu It was part of solar saros 119.

A physicist and engineer, Conn is also the current Board Chair of the Science Philanthropy Alliance, an organization that aims to increase private support for basic science research, and Dean Emeritus of the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). In the 1970s and 1980s, Conn participated in some of the earliest studies of fusion energy as a potential source of electricity, and he served on numerous federal panels, committees, and boards advising the government on the subject. In the early 1970s, he co-founded the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), and in the mid-1980s he led the formation of the Institute of Plasma and Fusion Research at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). As a university administrator in the 1990s and early 2000s, Conn served as Dean of the School of Engineering at UC San Diego as it established several engineering institutes and programs, including the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, known as Calit2, the Center for Wireless Communications, and the Whitaker Center for Biomedical Engineering. While at UC San Diego he also led the effort to establish an endowment for the School of Engineering, which began with major gifts from Irwin and Joan Jacobs. Irwin M.

Conn, American Institute of Physics Education Robert W. Conn was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1960 and attended Pratt Institute, also in Brooklyn, graduating with a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering with minors in Physics and Mathematics (1964). He did his graduate work at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA, where he received an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering (1965) and a Ph.D. degree in Engineering Science (1968).\\"Executive Profile of Robert W. Conn Ph.D.\\" Company Overview of The Kavli Foundation, Bloomberg Career =University of Wisconsin-Madison= In 1970, Conn began his professional career at the University of Wisconsin- Madison (UW), where he joined the nuclear engineering department as a visiting associate professor. He became associate professor in 1972 and full professor in 1975. It was at UW that Conn participated in some of the nation‚Äôs earliest feasibility studies of nuclear fusion energy. Between 1972 and 1980, he published nearly 100 articles and reports on plasma physics and fusion technology. Along with four colleagues, Conn founded UW's Fusion Technology Institute in 1972. He also became the university‚Äôs Romnes Faculty Endowed Chair Professor in 1978.Gerald Kulcinski, Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering and Director, Fusion Technology Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, \\"Early Days In Bob Conn's Career at Wisconsin\\", Robert W. Conn 70th Birthday Symposium at the University of California, San Diego, May 9, 2013 Conn‚Äôs early work came at a time when the federal government was eager to develop alternative sources of energy in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. He became one the first researchers to study the potential of nuclear fusion reactors, in which the fusion of hydrogen nuclei releases tremendous amounts of energy in the form of neutrons and energetic particles such as helium ions, the heat from which is then used to generate electricity. Nuclear fusion is the process that fuels stars, but triggering and sustaining nuclear fusion in a controlled manner on Earth so it can generate energy at a power plant is not yet a practical reality.\\"What is Fusion?\\", ITER Website Over his career Conn has conducted studies on designs for several different approaches to creating and confining high temperature fusion plasmas for energy production, among them magnetic confinement reactors, inertial confinement (sometimes called ‚Äúlaser fusion‚Äù) reactors, and nuclear fusion-fission hybrid reactors. Magnetic confinement reactor studies In magnetic confinement reactors, hydrogen gas (usually a 50-50 mixture of two heavier isotopes of ordinary hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium) is heated to very high temperatures (about 150 million degrees Celsius). At these high temperatures electrons separate from hydrogen nuclei and the gas becomes plasma, which is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. By controlling, or confining, the flow of plasma in test reactors, engineers can cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse ‚Äì creating for short amounts of time a nuclear fusion reaction that generates heat. One of the unsolved challenges of controlled nuclear fusion energy is to sustain a reaction that generates more energy than what goes into just maintaining the operation of the reactor plasma itself.\\"What is Fusion?\\", ITER Website In his early work, Conn studied numerous aspects of plasma for fusion applications, including how it can be confined with magnetic fields, thereby increasing its density and the likelihood that atomic nuclei collide and fuse. Conn also studied the boundary conditions between the plasma and the chamber walls inside a reactor, how to design the so-called ‚Äúblanket region‚Äù surrounding the plasma chamber so as to capture the fusion energy released as neutrons, and many other science and engineering challenges associated with practical reactor development.Robert W. Conn Biography Accompanying the Article, \\"The Role of Foundations and Societies in Supporting Frontier Research at Disciplinary Boundaries,\\" by Robert W.

Conn 70th Birthday Symposium at the University of California, San Diego, May 9, 2013 Inertial confinement reactor studies In inertial confinement reactors, lasers are fired at a pellet of fuel (often made from a combination of deuterium and tritium) with the goal of compressing, heating, and igniting the fusion fuel and creating a propagating burn through the compressed fuel plasma so as to burn approximately 30 percent before the compressed fuel, now in a very high temperature plasma state, itself disassembles.\\"Inertial Confinement Fusion: How to Make a Star\\", National Ignition Facility and Photon Science, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory While at UW, Conn collaborated with his colleagues on a research program called SOLASE that studied the physics and engineering challenges of inertial confinement reactors. The work identified the key physics, engineering, and technology issues that need to be solved if inertial fusion is to become a practical energy source. Among the many ideas advanced at that time was the use of a low-pressure gas in the chamber to absorb the primary radiation burst that accompanies each micro-explosion (not the neutrons generated) and cause that very short burst of radiation energy to be re-radiated to the walls over a much longer time scale. The SOLASE program studied numerous technological challenges, ranging from delivering fuel pellets to the center of the device at a rate of one to five per second, capturing the energy from the fusion events, shielding the laser beams from pellet explosion debris, and capturing the neutrons that carry 80 percent of the energy so as to make a practical power system.Gerald Kulcinski, Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering and Director, Fusion Technology Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, \\"Early Days In Bob Conn's Career at Wisconsin\\", Robert W. Conn 70th Birthday Symposium at the University of California, San Diego, May 9, 2013 Fusion-fission hybrid reactor studies In fusion-fission hybrid reactors, high-energy fast neutrons generated by nuclear fusion can be used to convert fertile materials such as Thorium-232 or Uranium-238 into fissionable fuels for fission reactors such as Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239. The high-energy fusion-generated neutrons can also be used to trigger nuclear fission in traditional nuclear fuels such as Uranium-235. The hybrid reactor concept has a fusion reactor at the core and a surrounding ‚Äúblanket‚Äù of fertile material, either Thorium-232 or Uranium-238. In a hybrid reactor, high-energy neutrons from fusion reactions are used to produce fissionable materials such as Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239 which would need then to be reprocessed and used as fuel in a fission nuclear power plant. One fusion hybrid plant can provide enough fuel for as many as five nuclear power plants of the same power. Conn‚Äôs work on inertial fusion hybrid reactors was conducted under the SOLASE-H program at the University of Wisconsin, and was supported by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).\\"SOLASE-H FTI Publications\\", Fusion Technology Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison =University of California, Los Angeles= In 1980, Conn left Wisconsin to join the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he continued research in plasma physics and nuclear fusion, as well as in materials science and energy policy. While at UCLA Conn led the establishment in 1986 of the Institute of Plasma and Fusion Research, and served as its founding director. It was during this time that Conn began more extensively to advise the federal government on fusion energy, specifically for the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the Department of Energy‚Äôs Magnetic Fusion Advisory Committee, among other governmental bodies. At UCLA Conn and his colleague, Farrokh Najmabadi, directed a national U.S. Department of Energy program known as ARIES, which prepared conceptual designs of possible fusion energy power plants. Conn also played a key role in the creation of PISCES, a laboratory research facility located first at UCLA and today at UC San Diego. The lab studies what happens when very high temperature plasma comes into contact with the material world, such as plasma chamber walls, as would occur inside a magnetic fusion reactor. Conn further led the formation of a multi-lateral experiment program, the Advanced Limiter Test or ALT program, that studied plasma as it interacts with components inside a tokamak fusion experiment, in this case the former TEXTOR tokamak machine at Germany‚Äôs largest national laboratory, the Forschungszentrum J√ºlich.

In Islamic jurisprudence, it typically refers to whatever intoxicates (in a large amount)https://sunnah.com/urn/1277530 Every intoxicant is haram... Sahih (Authentic) Hadith. What is commonly known as khamr however, is alcoholic beverages, and in more specific cases, wine. Most jurists from the 4 Madhahib generally agree that khamr encompasses all substances which intoxicate in large amounts, such as wine, whisky, beer etc. Over time, some jurists classified other intoxicants, such as opium and qat, as khamr, based on a hadith stating: Traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad indicated that khamr may for instance be made from two plants, the grape-vine and the date palm. Scriptural basis Quranic verses that regard alcohol (or intoxicants) as impermissible include According to a hadith where Imam Ahmad recorded what Abu Maysarah said, the verses came after requests by \`Umar to Allah, to \\"Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr!\\". Many Muslim believe the verses were revealed over time in this order to gradually nudge Muslim converts away from drunkenness and towards total sobriety. Since Islam brought \\"a society steeped in immorality\\" to one observing \\"the highest standards of morality\\", to ban alcohol abruptly would have been too harsh and impractical. Another hadith (coming from ‚ÄòAbd-Allaah ibn ‚ÄòUmar) report that Muhammad said: =Punishment= The Quran does not prescribe a penalty for consuming alcohol. Among hadith, the only reference for punishment comes from one by Anas ibn Malik, (according to Murtaza Haider of Dawn.com in Pakistan) who is reported to have stated that Muhammad prescribed 40 lashes \\"administered with two palm branches ... for someone accused of consuming alcohol\\". Saudi Arabian scholar Saalih al-Munajjid also states that a hadith report narrated by Sahih Muslim (3281) from Anas reports that Muhammad flogged someone who had drunk wine with palm branches stripped of their leaves and with shoes.search results, Sunnah.com Interpretation =Of prohibition= As far as the prohibition of alcohol in the Qur‚Äôan is concerned alcohol was prohibited after an incident which is recorded in the Sunni hadith literature in a hadith found in Jami Ω at-Tirmidhi where some companions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, were guests at a meal and drank wine and verses of the Qur‚Äôan were revealed. The narrative is found in Chapters of Tafsir Vol.5 Book 44 Hadith No. 3026. > \\"Narrated Abu 'Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami: that 'Ali bin Abi Talib said: > \\"'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf prepared some food for which he invited us, and he > gave us some wine to drink.

I do not worship what you worship, and we worship what we > worship' - so Allah, Most High, revealed: O you who believe! Do not approach > Salat when you are in a drunken state until you know what you are saying > (4:43).\\" ;All alcohol or only wine? The Mu'tazilites believe that khamr encompasses only wine made from e.g. grapes and dates, however the most popular opinion, if not more \\"correct\\" opinion, which is shared by all four greater schools is, that the prohibition of alcohol is not limited to wine only https://sorularlaislamiyet.com/sarhos-olmayacak-kadar-az-icki-icmek-haram-mi- alkol-alan-kendi-ifadesiyle-sosyal-icici-bir Sorularla Islamiyet (Questions on Islam) Turkish, Hanafi source.

It is permissible to consume food which has ethanol in it, if the purpose of the ethanol is not to consume it, but to dissolve and/or carry aromas, or as something which sterilizes the product. http://askimam.org/public/question_detail/32304 Ethanol in Ginger beerhttps://islamqa.org/hanafi/daruliftaa-birmingham/87720 Ethanolhttp://www.mufti-online.net/alcohol-in-soft-drinks.html Ethanolhttp://askimam.org/public/question_detail/6408.html Ethanol from sugar caneislamqa.org/hanafi/qibla-hanafi/35063 Ethanol purpose =Of punishment= According to scholar Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid of Saudi Arabia, the consensus of classical Islamic scholars of fiqh (fuqaha‚Äô) for the punishment for consumption of alcohol is flogging, but scholars differ as to the number of lashes to be administered to the drinker, \\"the majority of scholars are of the view that it is eighty lashes for a free man\\" and forty for slaves and women. However, according to Murtaza Haider of Dawn.com in Pakistan, \\"a consensus (ijma) on how to deal with alcohol has eluded Muslim jurist for more than a millennium\\". The \\"Maliki, Hanbali, and Hanafi schools\\" of Islamic jurisprudence consider 80 lashes to be lawful punishment, the Shafi‚Äôi school calls for 40 lashes. \\"The Hadith does not cover the matter in sufficient detail. ...

He was appointed as governor (beglarbeg) of Erivan Province (also known as Chokhur-e Sa'd) in 1568‚Äì1575. Thereafter, he led an embassy to the Ottoman Empire. On his return, he participated in some judicial developments, and was reappointed as governor of Erivan Province in 1578. In the same year, he served as main commander at the Battle of √áƒ±ldƒ±r during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War of 1578‚Äì1590, where his army was routed. A few years later, in 1583, Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq's second tenure over the Erivan Province was brought to an end due to encroachments by the Ottomans, who controlled the province until 1604. Biography =Embassy to the Ottomans= Painting of Tahmasp I at the Chehel Sotoun palace Erivan on a map of the Safavid Empire, created by Herman Moll Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq was the son of the previous governor of Erivan Province, Shahqoli Soltan Ustajlu, and was thus a member of the Turkoman Ustajlu tribe. The Erivan Province was centered on present-day Armenia, its provincial capital being Erivan (Yerevan). In 1568, king (shah) Tahmasp I (1524-1576) appointed him as his father's successor. Several years later, shortly before his death, Tahmasp I sent Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq as an ambassador to the neighboring Ottoman Empire to congratulate Murad III on his accession to the Ottoman throne. Tahmasp I wished to maintain the cordial relations that were initiated by the Peace of Amasya in 1555. The embassy, comprising some 250 men and 500 camels, arrived in Scutari, adjacent to the imperial capital, Constantinople, in May 1576. They brought numerous costly gifts, including precious manuscripts and stones, as well as weapons and fine rugs. The most costly gift of all was an imperial tent decorated with jewels. A grand reception followed, and the envoys were sent back with two luxuriously harnessed horses as well as 5,000 ducats. Both the ceremony and the construction of the tent are depicted in the first volume of the Shahanshah- nameh (dated 1581). The tent, considered to be a \\"magnificent piece of art\\" according to Zeren Tanƒ±ndƒ±, has not survived. Tahmasp I's letter of greeting, which Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq presented to Murad III, is in the archives of the Topkapƒ± Palace. =Judicial participation= During the short reign of king Ismail II (1576‚Äì1577), the king ordered Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq, Grand Vizier Mirza Shokrollah Isfahani, and Mirza Ali Qajar to function as members of the orf court within the court of justice, in order to assist the incumbent divanbegi (chancellor, chief justice) Soltan Ebrahim Mirza, in giving judgement on individual cases involving finance as well as matters affecting the interests of the state in general. The mandates and judgements proposed by Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq and the others were eventually endorsed by the \\"supreme divan\\", with Ismail II's approval, and for a few months, they were put to practise. =War= In 1578, king Mohammad Khodabanda (1578‚Äì1587) reappointed Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq as governor of Erivan Province. During the prelude to the Ottoman-Safavid of 1578-1590 the Safavids were well informed about the coming Ottoman assault but not about its magnitude. Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq was ordered by the king to recruit troops from all over northwestern Iran. Having assembled an army of some 15,000‚Äì30,000 men, he marched to the vicinity of √áƒ±ldƒ±r, not far from the Ottoman army, which was commanded by Lala Mustafa Pasha. Rudi Matthee states that his spies miscalculated the size of the Ottoman army, \\"only counting the ones that were visible to them\\". According to Iskandar Beg Munshi (died ) and Juan Tomas Minadoi (died 1615), Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq, \\"emboldened\\" by the news from his spies, decided to attack. Munshi put the blame on the Qizilbash, stating that they ruined \\"their potential strength through disunity and internal bickering and of foolhardily rushing into war, taking on an army of 100,000 with a mere 15,000 troops rather than waiting until all reinforcements had arrived\\". On 9 August, Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq and his men engaged the Ottomans. Heavily outnumbered, the Safavid forces were defeated, and some 5,000-7,000 were slain on the battlefield, while another 3,000 were taken captive and beheaded. Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq's second tenure over the Erivan Province was brought to an end in 1583 due to Ottoman encroachment, which resulted in an Ottoman takeover of the province until 1604. A gholam (slave-soldier) of Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq, Behbud Agha, was a Georgian who hailed from a Kartlian noble family (tavadi). He converted to Islam during his service to Mohammad Khan Tokhmaq. Two of Behbud Agha's sons, Ali-Qoli Beg and Emamqoli Beg, together briefly served as governors of Kartli in the 1610s.

Tao sold it to Fumio Hirahara (age 16) in 1940 for $10.00. Pajaro Valley Japanese Americans were removed in 1942 under Executive Order 9066 and the Hiraharas were sent to Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. The Hirahara family returned from Arkansas on June 4, 1945 and reoccupied the property. However, for many Japanese-Americans injustices continued after the war and many were unable to return to their prewar housing. Additions to the carriage barn on the Hirahara property were made in order to provide housing for other Japanese-Americans who did not have homes to which they could return.  House  The house was constructed in 1897 and designed by William H. Weeks, who was responsible for the design of hundreds of unique buildings throughout California.

Garhakota was then known as Hirdayanagar. The architecture of the temple is similar to the Shree Dig. Jain Chaudhari Mandir at nearby Garhakota. This temple was built in 1891(V.S. 1948), has 60 feet high spire. It consist 63 idols, moolnayak of this temple is an idol of Lord Parsvanath having 1000 serpent hoods. According to the inscriptions, Bhattaraka Mahendrakirti was the presiding Bhattaraka for most of pratishthas at Patnaganj (samvat 1835-1842 Bharat Ke Digambar jain Tirth, Pt 3, p. 176-181) and Bina Baraha (sam 1832), and was also responsible for administering Kundalpur during the Bundela period after its renovation in Samvat 1757. Jain Muni Shree Guptisagar was born in Garhakota. The nearby Garhakota fort has rivers Sunar and Gadhairi on the two sides. It covers 11 acres. This fort was the residence of Rajput Kings of Garhakota. Another fort was situated behind the main fort which was the residence of Pateriyas. They were Zameendars of the Pateriya Riyasat. During The War of Independence in 1857, Rani of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai wrote a letter to Raja Mardan Singh Bahadur of Garhakota to prepare against the British troops and to stop them at Sagar. Mardan Singh and Gunthai Pateriya were killed in this battle. The fort was raided and demolished by Sir Hugh Rose in 1858 in the course of Ghadar. Pateriya fort, Gopalji Krishna temple, Jagannathji Pateriya Vishnu temple and Shiv temple were built in 16th century AD. The Pateriya fort was abandoned after the Ghadar rampage. Pateriyas were Jijhotiya Brahmins and this was not their original surname but the title which was awarded by the Bundela king Jujhar Sing after their victorious participation in a big battle against the Moguls in 17th century. Architecture The tall temple is a pristine example of the Maratha/Bundeli architecture of Jain temples of the period. The temple is surrounded by a tall wall (parkota) with a walkway on the top. It is said that a gaddi (seat) for Bhattarak Mahendrakirti existed in the chamber above the main entrance. Internally there is an enclosed parikrama where additional shrines are now located. Reported Miracles According to the tradition, the water at a spring (kunda) just outside the temple was miraculously turned into ghee by Bhattaraka Mahendrakirti.Pateriaji Garhakota Dipika, Dr. Bhagchandra Jain Bhagendu, Bhagchand Jain Sarvajanik Nyas, 1997 There is an old column on the East side of the temple.

By the first half of the nineteenth century, St Johns's could only accommodate 250 people although the parish of Aberdare had a population of 13,000. The condition of the church was said to be poor, and one commentator stated that the parishioners worshipped their make in darkness. By 1853, the burial ground was full and the vicar, John Griffith, reported that until the ground was drained last year there was so much water in the soil that the coffins were often floating in it. The drainage now is not very complete. It took Griffith ten years to instigate the restoration of the church at a cost of ¬£900, and it only became suitable for regular worship once again shortly before his departure to be rector of Merthyr Tydfil.

His father subsequently married Elizabeth Robertson and had more children, the first being Alexander Lamont. Eventually, the family included 14 sons and one daughter. Trinidad sugar planter At the age of 20, John Lamont emigrated to the Caribbean, and arrived in Trinidad around 1801 or 1802. He served his apprenticeship as overseer and manager on the Eccles sugar plantation. before becoming a planter himself. In 1809, he and a friend bought the Cedar Grove sugar estate of in South Naparima, which had more than a hundred slaves on it. His family made contact again in 1816, when his half-brother Alexander Lamont wrote him a \\"truly fraternal letter\\" with news of their brothers. John Lamont replied that he was \\"charmed with your description of the happy party assembled at Kirkmichael. How delighted I should be to make one of the number.\\" In 1817 Boyden Lamont, one of his half- brothers, came out to Trinidad to join the sugar business. John bought Boyden the adjacent Canaan estate with 70 slaves, and in 1819 John purchased the lave (or remaining share) of the Cedar Grove estate. In 1823‚Äì1824 he gave evidence to the enquiry by Royal Commissioners, including Fortunatus Dwarris, into proposed changes to English law affecting the West Indies: Lamont described himself as \\"a sugar planter\\" who had two estates of his own, and \\"3 more under my superintendence as attorney\\". He said he had served \\"first as overseer, then as manager, and now a proprietor\\". in 1829, after a visit to Scotland, Lamont returned to Trinidad with his cousin George Cole, who became his Glasgow agent for sugar sales. Also in 1829, Lamont added called \\"La Grenade\\" to his Cedar Grove estate, and he later became part-proprietor of the \\"St Helena\\" estate. After the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, he got ¬£9,000 government compensation for 170 slaves, while Boyden got ¬£3,700 for 78 slaves on his Caanan estate. In 1836 John Lamont was a member of the Port of Spain Presbyterian Church Committee of Management. Boyden Lamont died in 1837, his estate was inherited by John who passed an interest in it on to their brothers James and Norman. Visits to Scotland, and Benmore Estate When Lamont's father fell ill, he greatly wished to see his oldest son again. John returned to Toward from October 1828 to June 1829 to see his father, who died on 6 December 1829, after John went back to Trinidad. From then on, John Lamont revisited Toward every year. Four of his brothers had already died, and Alexander was the only one who had a son; James Lamont. John became fond of his nephew and saw in him the potential to renew the position of the Lamont family. After visiting his uncle in Trinidad in 1847, James returned to Scotland and John engaged lawyers to find his nephew a suitable Scottish household. He bought Benmore Estate in 1849, and arranged for architects to construct a new Benmore House to replace the old manor house. John Lamont visited Scotland that year to see what progress was being made. He returned to Trinidad, but on 20 November 1850 died at his house, the Cascade, in Diego Martin. He was buried next to his brother Boyden in a cemetery in the Caanan estate, which now forms part of the La Romaine district of San Fernando. James Lamont inherited the estates, but his interests were in exploring and he sold the Benmore Estate, while continuing to profit from his Trinidad estates which he only visited five more times. In 1907 he handed them on to his son Sir Norman Lamont, 2nd Baronet, who diversified away from sugar planting and made considerable agricultural improvements. He lived at Palmiste, San Fernando, Trinidad, and on his death in 1949, Norman was buried in the Caanan cemetery beside Boyden and John Lamont.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. As is shown over 92% obscuration, the center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 250 km (150 mi) above the Antarctic Circle. It was the first of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the next occurred in the same hemisphere on November 21, nearly on the opposite side of the previous eclipse. It was part of solar saros 144. Description The eclipse occurred in the most of southern Africa, many of Indian Ocean's islands, a part of Western Australia and a very tiny part of Antarctica as the whole day was darkness in other parts. It occurred over a small piece of the Atlantic and many parts of the Indian Ocean and stretched just south of the Equator. The rim of the eclipse included Namacqualand (now Namibia), Great Zimbabwe (now Zimbabwe), Abyssinia (a part now Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania) and old Ethiopia (now Tanzania) and Port Herald, Western Australia. The eclipse started in Mozambique and southern Africa at sunrise and finished at sunset in Antarctica and off the coast of South Australia. It showed about up to 35% obscurity in Africa, 15 to over 40% in Madagascar, in Mozambique, 15% in Quelimane, 25% in Maputo and around 25% in Albany, Western Australia. The greatest eclipse was off the shore of Antarctica at 65.4 S and 60.8 E at 6:42 UTC (10:42 AM local time). The subsolar marking was in Central India.

Flash evaporation, or flashing, is the process of volatile components suddenly vaporizing from their liquid state. This often happens during the transportation of petroleum products through pipelines and into vessels, such as when the stream from a common separation unit flows into an on-site atmospheric storage tank. Vessels that are used to intentionally ‚Äúflash‚Äù a mixture of gas and saturated liquids are aptly named \\"flash drums.\\" A type of vapor-liquid separator. A venting apparatus is used in these vessels to prevent damage due to increasing pressure, extreme cases of this are referred to as boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). The composition of the gas that is flashed is dependent on many factors, therefore it is suggested that all extractions be analyzed to determine accurate compositional values. As a generality, this definition applies to the nature of flashing hydrocarbons (HC) that make up oil and natural gas, ‚ÄúIf the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the flashed vapor is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid\\". Although the flashed portion will be primarily components with higher volatilities (lighter HC), heavier HC will also flash into the vapor phase to some extent. Composition of flash gas is highly dependent on temperature and pressure and can therefore be manipulated using these control variables to become a usable resource (natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL‚Äôs), alternative fuels, etc.) if proper infrastructure and sponsorship is in place. The production of flash-gas and its release into the atmosphere, via venting and improper handling during production, is of concern to environmental efforts due to the presence of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP), Greenhouse Gases (GHG), and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) which have been suggested to have harmful long-term environmental impacts. Various efforts by organizations around the world have been made to develop appropriate guidelines for handling flash gas as well as tools for evaluating flash emissions through model based calculations. Natural Gas Liquids/Liquid Petroleum Gas Pumpjacks operating in North Dakota with a flare unit.

In other words, NGL is the liquids removed from natural gas such as ethane and heavier products.GPSA Engineering Data Book. S.l.: GSAP, 2004. Print. Components of NGL‚Äôs have varying states during production, meaning that some will exist solely as a liquid or vapor, and some will be a mixture of the two depending on the current temperature and pressure. Therefore, it is necessary that components of NGL are distinguished as either natural-gas condensate, heavier components (C5+), or ‚Äúother NGL‚Äù, lighter components that typically remain in the vapor phase during production. NGL is not to be confused with its subcategory LPG, liquefied petroleum gas, described as ‚Äúhydrocarbon mixtures in which the main components are propane, iso and normal butane, propylene and butylenes.‚Äù Capturing NGL‚Äôs has shown an uptick in their economic share of U.S. production levels the past few years,\\"U.S. Energy Information Administration - EIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis.\\" What are natural gas liquids and how are they used? - Today in Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Uses of NGLs vary, from other combustible fuels like autogas and natural gasoline, to the manufacturing of plastics. The apparent value of these materials has put the level of products developed from NGLs at an all-time high in the United States in 2015. Despite its value and use, many of the components that make up NGL and LPG become considered ‚Äúwaste gas‚Äù during production and are flared on-site or vented into the atmosphere as flash gas.Peterson, J.; Cooper, H.; Baukal, C.: Hydrocarbon processing, 2007, 111-115. This can be due to a lack of infrastructure to capture and store and/or transport these liquids to market. Profitability under current models is highly dependent on the access to pipeline infrastructure, gas volume produced, and the number of/distance between production facilities (batteries).Johnson, M.R.; Coderre, A.R.: Canada, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control. 2012, 8, 121‚Äì131.

Flash gas is the emissions from flash evaporation, breathing emissions, and working emissions. Breathing, or standing emissions, occur naturally as liquid sits in a vessel and undergoes normal evaporation into the atmosphere. Working emissions are created when the liquid is agitated, such as during transportation, emptying/filling of tanks, sampling, etc. Contained within all of these emissions are materials that have been deemed hazardous to humans and the environment by regulatory agencies and scientific bodies worldwide.Sources:  *Sources:  The complex nature of chemical interactions in flare, flash, and other production vapors have spawned many efforts to describe and control how these hydrocarbons interact with other materials in the atmosphere to create air pollution.Sources:  * The study of these interactions is encompassed by the field of atmospheric chemistry. =Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP)= The environmental impact of emissions can be quantified in terms of the amount of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) they contain.

These oxidants participate in further atmospheric reactions which are said to ‚Äúproduce haze, damage plant and animal life, and materials such as rubber, induce discomfort and are suspected to have toxic effects on humans.‚Äù Mechanistic description for the formation of Photochemical Smog :{\\\\mathit NO2} + \\\\mathit hv -> {\\\\mathit NO} + \\\\mathit O (1) Nitrogen dioxide reacts with UV radiation to form nitrogen oxide and an oxygen radical. :{\\\\mathit O} + \\\\mathit O_2 -> {\\\\mathit O_3} (2) The radical oxygen combines with O2 gas in the atmosphere to form ozone. :{\\\\mathit O_3} + \\\\mathit NO -> {\\\\mathit NO_2} + \\\\mathit O_2 (3) Ozone reacts with nitrogen oxide to form nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. :{\\\\mathit RH} + \\\\mathit OH{.} -> {\\\\mathit R{.}} + \\\\mathit H_2O (4) A species of VOC bound to hydrogen reacts with hydroxide to form a VOC free- radical and water vapor. :{\\\\mathit R{.}} + \\\\mathit O_2 -> {\\\\mathit RO_2} (5) The free-radical VOC reacts with oxygen to form a VOC bound with oxygen gas. :{\\\\mathit RO2} + \\\\mathit NO -> {\\\\mathit RO^-{.}} +\\\\mathit NO_2 (6) The VOC oxygen bond is broken in the presence of nitrogen oxide, forming a VOC-oxygen anion and nitrogen dioxide to further participate in reaction 3.

Retrieved April 11, 2017, from https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Case_Studies%3A_Kinetics/Smog Additionally, some organic compounds (notably aldehydes) can photolyze in the atmosphere to form radicals which participate in atmospheric reactions. [46] VOCs or oxidant precursors are emitted to the atmosphere from both natural and man-made sources. Globally, natural emissions appear to outweigh anthropogenic emissions. However, it is the high concentration of anthropogenic sources of volatile organics together with NOx emissions from combustion processes in urban areas which increase the risk of the urban ozone problem. Wind and other climatological activities (transport mechanisms) then carry the formed oxidant into rural areas. =VOC Diagnostics= Studies have been done to try to find if VOCs can be directly related to cancers in the human body. One such example is a group that collected breath samples from a lung cancer patient to determine the VOC content of the lungs before and after surgery. This study suggests that there may be certain biomarker VOCs that indicate the presence of a disease or cancer in a patient. Additional researchers have also begun trying to identify ties between the onset of cancer and the levels of VOCs in the environment.EPA-450/2-78-041 and \\"Measurement of Volatile Organic Compounds ‚Äì Supplement 1\\" (EPA-450/3-82-0m19, July 1982. A database to gather information on cancer and other aspects of VOCs in human cell lines, the human volatilome, has been started by researchers. Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) are a type of hazardous particulate that is not currently well understood, but is thought to make up a significant portion of the tropospheric aerosol or submicron atmospheric particle mass. [50,51] Aerosols effect the atmospheric radiative balance through the absorption and scattering of radiant energy, leading to shifts in weather via changes in cloud drop nucleation and the solar radiation budget.Williams, J., & Koppmann, R. (2007). Volatile Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere: An Overview. Volatile Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere, 1-32. They are said to be formed ‚Äúwhen the atmospheric oxidation products of volatile organic compounds undergo gas-particle transfer.‚Äù The contribution of VOCs to the levels of SOA in the atmosphere have been modeled using simulation chamber experiments to gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved. SOAs are said to be a major causative factor to the mortality rates associated with the exposure to harmful fine particulate air pollution however there is an absence of in vitro particle exposure techniques to test for toxicity. There is research currently being done to find the interaction between SOA‚Äôs and lung cells to see their potential harmful effects. Methods for Calculating and Estimating Flash Gas Composition and Flash Loss =Flash Gas Calculations= Calculation of flash gas content is often based on the principle of vapor- liquid equilibrium (VLE) and combines theories like Raoult‚Äôs Law with component mass/energy balances, similar to those used in distillation unit operations.Skogestad, Sigurd. Chemical and energy process engineering. Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2009. Print. Since the mixture is of multiple components, more complex equations like the Rachford-Rice equation are applicable in ideal situations and have frequently been used in chemical plants and refineries.Rachford, H.H. and Rice, J.D.: ‚ÄúProcedure for Use of Electrical Digital Computers in Calculating Flash Vaporization Hydrocarbon Equilibrium,‚Äù Journal of Petroleum Technology, Sec. 1, p. 19, Oct. 1952.) It is important to note that these equations are based on the ideal gas law and liquids at thermodynamic equilibrium, while hydrocarbons in oil and gas production are considered to be non-ideal or real, and may not be in equilibrium. Additional relationships, such as the Van Der Waals equation and other equations of state (EOS) can be applied to account for these discrepancies and can be used to provide a better estimation of flash gas content. Higher molecular weight hydrocarbons show even further deviation from ideal behavior and need additional computational adjustments, such as Sutton‚Äôs(Sutton, R.P. 1985. Compressibility Factors for High-Molecular-Weight Reservoir Gases. Presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, 22‚Äì26 September. SPE-14265-MS. https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/14265-MS) modification to Steward et al.(Stewart, W.F., Burkhardt, S.F., and Voo, D. 1959. Prediction of Pseudo-critical Parameters for Mixtures. Presented at the AIChE Meeting, Kansas City, Missouri, USA, 18 May 1959.) =Chemical Simulation= Example of a plot flow diagram (PFD) detailing a crude oil distillation operation. More realistic modelling techniques encompass variable conditions that can occur on-site during petroleum processing by using sample analysis software at the flash site, e.g. ProMax Software, which is able to predict emissions and losses due to flash, i.e. working and standing losses. Other techniques that are used to make calculations of flash losses (without sampling and analysis) are referred to as chemical process simulators, e.g. WinSim, Designer II, HYSIM, and VMG. These programs can also have the ability to incorporate data from site-specific samples to give more accurate results. Alternatively, a captured liquid or gas sample can be analyzed in a laboratory setting to determine the composition and dissolved gas-oil-ratio (GOR) using precise measurement techniques. However, this only provides insight on the sample of flash gas and does not account for real time fluctuations of all on- site sources of flash gas, including working and standing losses. =Estimations Based on Volatile Organic Compounds= Another acceptable technique in flash estimation is the Vasques-Beggs Equation (VBE) which calculates the amount of flash gas in terms of total VOC and not into their individual components.Cheremisinoff, Nicholas P. Pollution control handbook for oil and gas engineering. Beverly, MA: Schrivener Publishing, 2016. Print. This model can only calculate the instantaneous flash gas and does not calculate the working or standing flash gas losses.United States. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Calculating Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Flash Emissions from Crude Oil and Condensate Tanks at Oil and Gas Production Sites. Vol. 5942. Print. Air Permit Reference Guide. Additional equations have been developed to use in accordance with the VBE equation to determine species-specific losses, such as HAP-calc for determining the amount of Hazardous Air Pollution (HAP) produced. =Equations of State= An equation of state (EOS) is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describes the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions.Perrot, Pierre (1998). A to Z of Thermodynamics. Oxford University Press. . EOS are used to make calculations about the predicted phase-behavior of hydrocarbons before extraction from a reservoir.Ashour, I., 2011. Applications of Equations of State in the Oil and Gas Industry. Oman: Department of Petroleum and Chemical Engineering College of Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson are examples of two commonly used EOS in industry for determining critical properties of multicomponent mixtures.Sadus, R. J. (1994) Calculating Critical Transitions of Fluid Mixtures: Theory Vs. Experiment, AIChE J., 40, 1376-1403. These equations can be useful for the prediction and estimation of flash loss when used in conjunction with sampling and reservoir data. Reduction of Flare Gas =Vapor Recovery Units= Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant Scrubber Tower. The scrubber tower is part of the off-gas treatment system that will be used to filter air emissions from the Pueblo Chemical Agent- Destruction Pilot Plant. Vapor Recovery Units (VRU‚Äôs) have commonly been used to capture vented gas and other waste gas (vapor recovery) during petroleum production, it was originally created to capture hydrogen sulfide from oilfield stock tanks. A VRU works by compressing the flash gas that is produced in storage tanks and other units to be put into a pipeline. A basic VRU is made up of a scrubber, compressor, and a switch. Once the pressure in the tank reaches the set-point, the switch kicks on the compressor and sends the vapor to a scrubber where the liquid portion is separated out.\\"Vapor recovery unit.\\" Schlumberger. Web. 27 Mar. 2017. http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/v/vapor_recovery_unit.aspx The gas portions can be used to fuel on-site operation, be transported to storage tanks for further separation, can be piped out directly to another facility, or be injected into a compressor; the liquid portions (NGLs) that commonly form are normally sent to the water tank. If they are sent to oil storage they will re-vaporize and go through the VRU, creating an endless cycle. VRU‚Äôs can create revenue through the resale and use of the captured vapors that would have been vented into the environment and lost. The revenue produced is dependent on the amount of vapor captured and sold into a pipeline. Analysis has been done to show the economic impacts from emission reduction and capture using VRU and other technology.ICF International (ICF). (2014). Economic Analysis of Methane Emission Reduction Opportunities in the U.S. Onshore Oil and Natural Gas Industries. Fairfax, VA: ICF. Accessed September 2014: https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/methane_cost_curve_report.pdf. These units also reduce the amount of emissions of VOCs associated with oil and natural gas production, again by preventing them from being vented directly into the atmosphere. There have been concerns raised about the efficiency of VRU‚Äôs. It has been pointed out that vapor recovery units (VRU‚Äôs) cannot recover lighter hydrocarbons that have been dissolved into the liquid phase because the units are designed to recover what is already in the vapor phase. Also, when the gas in put under high pipeline pressure, NGLs are condensed out and are returned to the water tank (in rare instances they are processed and sold as NGL‚Äôs). =Thief Hatch Alternatives/Vapor Recovery Towers= Thief hatch, also known as a gauge hatch, is a term given to a close-able aperture on a tank or vessel used in the oil and gas industry.http://www.oilfieldpartsxpress.com/thief_hatches.html) These hatches are placed in atmospheric or low pressure tanks in order to allow for level or sample measurements and to provide vacuum relief to the vessel. Thief hatches are also used in gauge tanks and in transport vehicles where they must be opened to the atmosphere to take measurements and samples. Flash gas is readily leaked whenever these hatches are opened and therefore they can pose a problem in terms of emissions. There have also been reports of fatalities caused by manual tank gauging and sampling via thief hatches. Vapor recovery towers (VRT) have been posed as a potential solution for vapor loss via thief hatches. VRTs are a way to reduce the vapor loading on storage tanks by removing some of the flash gas before it gets to the oil tanks. The VRT can improve safety by reducing the potential for issues relating to high vapor evolution from the oil tanks. =Heater Treaters= Vertical and horizontal heater treaters. Heater treaters are often used in industry for the following: To break up emulsions to separate the oil from produced water, stabilize the crude oil or condensate by separating volatile, lighter hydrocarbon fractions, (C1-C8) from the heavy, less volatile fraction (C9+) for safety reasons. Vent gas from heater treaters is known as a significant source of flash gas and consequential VOCs. It is possible to re-route this vent gas to a VRU to capture some of the stream or other processing units in order to reduce emissions and make additional revenue. =Oil and Gas Separators/Pressure Optimization= Three phase separators are used in oil and gas production to separate water, oil, and gas into isolated streams. A separator, in general, is a pressurized vessel that is used to divide a product based on principles of chemical separation such as phase and density. These vessels are also known as de-liquidizers or degassers because they either remove liquid from the bulk gas stream or remove gas from the bulk liquid stream during processing. Pressure optimization based on sample compositions taken upstream can provide a solution to inefficient separations and can help to reduce the overall amount of flash gas produced.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. As is shown under 6% obscuration, the center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 2,670 km above the area (68 S) south of the Antarctic Circle. It was the first of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the last occurred in the same hemisphere on June 27, nearly on the opposite side of the previous eclipse. It was the last three of the solar saros 111, the next was on December 2, 1880 and the last was on January 5, 1935. Description The eclipse took place in a part of Northern Antarctica (in areas that had a 24-hour daylight at the time) to the area separating the Indian and Pacific Ocean, to the range of 170th meridian east and up to around the 50th meridian east. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean and ended at sunset in Antarctica. A very small part occurred on the location of the previous eclipse, many areas occurred on the opposite side. The greatest eclipse was off the shore of Antarctica at 68.8 S and 99.1 E at 18:29 UTC (10:42 AM local time). The subsolar marking was in the Pacific Ocean around the Tropic of Capricorn. The next solar eclipse which occurred in the same area was an annular eclipse on November 11, 1863, parts were inside the umbral portion.

Guns removed from ships of the Imperial German Navy were modified to perform Coastal Artillery and Railway Artillery roles and saw service in both world wars. The actual bore diameter was , but the classification system for artillery rounded up to the next highest centimeter. History In 1888 Krupp designed the 24 cm K L/35 and started production to arm two classes of the Imperial German Navy's coastal defense ships. Krupp also produced guns for export that armed one class of coastal defense ships for Argentina and one class of protected cruisers and one unique armored cruiser for Austria-Hungary. The Ottoman s were rearmed with these guns in the early 1890s. Naval Artillery The 24 cm K L/35 was the primary armament of the Siegfried-class and Odin-class coastal defense ships of the Imperial German Navy. :German ship details: :*Siegfried-class - The six ships of this class had a primary armament of three guns in an unusual arrangement.

Two MPL C/93 single gun turrets were mounted side-by-side forward, while a third was mounted aft of the central superstructure in a single gun turret. The 24 cm K L/35 was also the primary armament of the Argentine Navy's Independencia-class coastal defense ships. :Argentine ship details: :* Independencia-class ‚Äì The two ships of this class had a primary armament of two guns, which were mounted in two single gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. The 24 cm K L/35 was the primary armament of the Kaiser Franz Joseph I-class of protected cruisers and the unique armored cruiser SMS Kaiserin und K√∂nigin Maria Theresia. :Austro- Hungarian ship details: :*Kaiser Franz Joseph I-class - The two ships of this class had a primary armament of two guns, which were mounted in two single gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. :*SMS Kaiserin und K√∂nigin Maria Theresia - This ship had a primary armament of two guns, which were mounted in two single gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Coastal Artillery During 1916 the Odin-class ships were decommissioned and disarmed. The 24 cm K L/35 guns salvaged from these ships were converted to coastal artillery. Three guns were emplaced at Battery Bremen on Norderney and three guns were emplaced at Battery S1 on Sylt. They remained there until the late 1930s. There are currently four guns belonging to battery No4 at Puerto Belgrano, Argentina. Ottoman Empire purchased thirty 24 cm K L/35 guns during the 1880s and a number of these engaged the allied naval forces during the Gallipoli campaign.  Railway Artillery  Beginning in 1937 the six guns at Norderny and Sylt were converted to railway artillery and were collectively known as 24 cm Theodor Bruno Kanone (E). During the Battle of France Theodor Brunos equipped three batteries of two guns each. Later one battery of four guns defended Cherbourg from 1941 until June 1944 when they were destroyed during the Battle of Cherbourg.

It ended in victory for Milan. Background Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan, later the Duke of Milan, had ambitions to control the whole of northern Italy, but the city of Florence stood up against him and formed a defensive League which included Francis Novello da Carrara, Stephen III of Bavaria, and Jean III of Armagnac. In March 1390, they hired the English mercenary, John Hawkwood, and his private army to defend the town and requested help from Jean III. Hawkwood prepared defensive earthworks and repulsed an attack by a Milanese army led by General Jacopo dal Verme. He then dug in at Pandino, some 10 miles south-east of Milan, in June 1391 to await the arrival of Jean III, who was crossing the Alps from France with his army. However, after being continually harassed by Dal Verme's troops, Hawkwood's men struck camp and retreated from the district. Battle of Alessandria After Jean III's force had arrived in Italy it was attacked on 25 July 1391 by the Milanese army at Alessandria and decisively beaten. Jean III himself was killed.

Substitution is the second most effective of the five members of the hierarchy of hazard controls in protecting workers, after elimination. Substitution and elimination are most effective early in the design process, when they may be inexpensive and simple to implement, while for an existing process they may require major changes in equipment and procedures. The concept of prevention through design emphasizes integrating the more effective control methods such as elimination and substitution early in the design phase. Hazard substitutions can involve not only changing one chemical for another, but also using the same chemical in a less hazardous form. Substitutions can also be made to processes and equipment. In making a substitution, the hazards of the new material should be considered and monitored, so that a new hazard is not unwittingly introduced, causing \\"regrettable substitutions\\". Substitution can also fail as a strategy if the hazardous process or material is reintroduced at a later stage in the design or production phases, or if cost or quality concerns cause a substitution to not be adopted.  Examples  = Chemicals = A common substitution is to replace a toxic chemical with a less toxic one. Some examples include replacing the solvent benzene, a carcinogen, with toluene; switching from organic solvents to water-based detergents; and replacing paints containing lead with those containing non-leaded pigments. Dry cleaning can avoid the use of toxic perchloroethylene by using petroleum-based solvents, supercritical carbon dioxide, or wet cleaning techniques. Chemical substitutions are an example of green chemistry. Chemicals can also be substituted with a different form of the same chemical. In general, inhalation exposure to dusty powders can be reduced by using a slurry or suspension of particles in a liquid solvent instead of a dry powder, or substituting larger particles such as pellets or ingots. Some chemicals, such as nanomaterials, often cannot be eliminated or substituted with conventional materials because their unique properties are necessary to the desired product or process. However, it may be possible to choose properties of the nanoparticle such as size, shape, functionalization, surface charge, solubility, agglomeration, and aggregation state to improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired functionality. In 2014, the U.S. National Academies released a recommended decision-making framework for chemical substitutions. The framework maintained health-related metrics used by previous frameworks, including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, acute and chronic toxicity, dermal and eye irritation, and dermal and respiratory sensitization, and ecotoxicity. It added an emphasis on assessing actual exposure rather than only the inherent hazards of the chemical itself, decision rules for resolving trade-offs among hazards, and consideration of novel data sources on hazards such as simulations. The assessment framework has 13 steps, many of which are unique, such as dedicated steps for scoping and problem formulation, assessing physicochemical properties, broader life-cycle assessment, and research and innovation. The framework also provides guidance on tools and sources for scientific information. = Processes and equipment = An aerosol droplet containing nanomaterials ejected from a vial during sonication. Eliminating or limiting sonication and other handling processes reduces inhalation hazards. Hazards to workers can be reduced by limiting or replacing procedures that may aerosolize toxic materials contained in the item. Examples include limiting agitation procedures such as sonication, or by using a lower-temperature process in chemical reactors to minimize release of materials in exhaust. Substituting a water-jet cutting process instead of mechanical sawing of a solid item also creates less dust. Equipment can also be substituted, for example using a self-retracting lifeline instead of a fixed rope for fall protection, or packaging materials in smaller containers to prevent lifting injuries. Health effects from noise can be controlled by purchasing or renting less noisy equipment. This topic has been the subject of several Buy Quiet campaigns, and the NIOSH Power Tools Database contains data on sound power, pressure, and vibration levels of many power tools.  Regrettable substitutions  N-vinyl formamide requires use of the highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (H-CN). Even though the end product is a less-toxic alternative to acrylamide for end users, the hazards to workers manufacturing the material should also be considered in an alternatives assessment.alt=A three-reaction chemical synthesis scheme leading to N-vinyl formamide A regrettable substitution occurs when a material or process believed to be less hazardous turns out to have an unexpected hazard. One well-known example occurred when dichloromethane was phased out as a brake cleaner due to its environmental effects, but its replacement n-hexane was subsequently found to be neurotoxic. Often the substances being replaced have well-studied hazards, but the alternatives may have little or no toxicity data, making alternatives assessments difficult. Another type of regrettable substitution involves shifting the burden of a hazard to another party. One example is that the potent neurotoxin acrylamide can be replaced with the safer N-vinyl formamide, but the synthesis of the latter requires use of the highly toxic hydrogen cyanide, increasing the hazards to workers in the manufacturing firm. In performing an alternatives assessment, including the effects over the entire product lifecycle as part of a life-cycle assessment can mitigate this.

Formed in 1971 by the Association of American Colleges (AAC), known today as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU), PSEW worked to improve access to and equity within higher education for women, addressing the needs of university students, faculty, staff, and administrators. PSEW produced and distributed materials about the status of women in higher education, advised colleges and universities about policies related to affirmative action, women's studies programs, and hiring women faculty, and worked with policymakers to introduce legislation to improve gender equity in American higher education. PSEW's periodical, On Campus with Women (OCWW), ran from 1971-2013 through the AACU, publishing articles and research related to women in higher education. PSEW also played a significant role in the development and passage of Title IX, the portion of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits discrimination in education on the basis of sex.Project on the Status and Education of Women (Association of American Colleges) Records, 1969-1991; Finding Aid. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 and reincorporated into the AACU as the Program on the Status and Education of Women. The program was directed by Caryn McTighe Musil until its conclusion in 2012. An extensive collection of the materials and publications produced by PSEW is held at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. History and Formation The Project on the Status and Education of Women was founded in 1971 as the first step in a shift by the Association of American Colleges (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities) towards attention to student diversity. Located in the headquarters of the AACU in Washington, D.C., the organization operated with a small staff. PSEW received funding through grants, including from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Ford Foundation. PSEW was integral in the passage of Title IX. As part of this effort, the organization visited schools, educated lawmakers on women's issues in academia, and advocated for policies to improve women's situation on campuses. PSEW pursued a focus on sexual harassment and rape on campus, producing educational materials on these subjects in the 1980s. Notably, the organization coined the term \\"chilly climate\\", used in many of its works to describe the challenges faced by women in education. =People= Bernice Resnick Sandler served as the director of PSEW from 1971-1991. Sandler was also active in the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL), through which she did similar work promoting gender equity in higher education. After Sandler, Caryn McTighe Musil served as director of the successor Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW) until 2012. Margaret C. Dunkle served as the Associate President of PSEW from 1972-1977. Roberta M. Hall and Grace L. Mastalli were also important staff members. Main Contributions =Publications= PSEW was founded to aid colleges and universities in developing policies that addressed gender discrimination and sexual harassment. However, their work soon expanded beyond this mission, as PSEW staff began publishing original work on women in higher education. PSEW published over 100 reports, as well as booklets, pamphlets, and their newsletter On Campus with Women. Their publications addressed a range of subjects including recruiting women students and faculty, issues relevant to minority students, sex discrimination in hiring, sex bias in research, Title IX, financial assistance, sexual harassment on campus, and the academic climate for women. Their materials reached college presidents and faculty as well as policymakers, and not only disseminated information about events and research relating to women in education, but also informed women directly about their own legal rights to education. PSEW published the first papers on women of color in higher education and the first national reports on sex discrimination in college sports, hostile classroom environments, campus gang rape, and sexual harassment. \\"Chilly Climate\\" The organization additionally produced publications addressing a term it coined, the \\"chilly climate\\" facing women at colleges and universities, a program of discourse which became a defining initiative for the group's contributions to equality in education. The \\"chilly climate\\" was illustrated by descriptions of challenges experienced by women students and faculty, from disparaging comments made about women and their academic capacities to the sidelining and interruption of women in class. PSEW's discussion of these challenges to women's experiences in a learning environment contributed to wider dialogue about the unequal learning environments experienced by people from various underserved groups. The project published several influential works on the topic. In 1982, Hall and Sandler published \\"The Classroom Climate: A Chilly One for Women?\\" The paper was funded by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) of the U.S. Department of Education. PSEW held a conference in November 1982 called \\"The Chilly Classroom Climate: Sharing Strategies for Change\\" to publicize and discuss its findings. The final paper distributed at the conference sold over 40,000 copies between 1982 and 1990. On Campus with Women Perhaps PSEW's most prominent publication was their periodical, On Campus with Women (OCWW), which published research and articles on issues pertaining to women in higher education. Founded by Sandler at the inception of the PSEW in 1971, its content focused on women's leadership, campus climate, curriculum and pedagogy, and new research on women's participation in higher education. In the fall of 2002, OCWW moved exclusively online. In 2013, the publication of On Campus with Women as a separate periodical ended, and its mission to cover gender issues in higher education was absorbed by the AACU's other journals, such as Liberal Education and Diversity and Democracy. =Advocacy= Title IX PSEW played in an integral role in working with Congressional staff and other organizations on the drafting and implementation of Title IX, interfacing with other organizations and Congress to construct and pass the law. PSEW also acted as a resource for universities to consult on potential implementation and policy between the law's June 1972 passage and the 1975 final report on enforcement and regulations from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The organization helped colleges and universities to institute policies that limited their risk of violating the Title IX requirements. During this interim period, PSEW often worked with the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE), a consortium of organizations founded to advocate for implementation regulations of Title IX on the enforcement, implementation, and funding of women's educational programs. Post-Title IX After Title IX became law, PSEW continued to educate policymakers and government officials about women's issues on college campuses. PSEW staff often visited college campuses to identify issues and to work with administrations on the implementation and enforcement of Title IX. PSEW also created educational materials on rape and sexual harassment as resources for campuses. Legacy and Absorption into AACU The Project on the Status and Education of Women was the first national project directed at women of higher education and was one of first programs to address gender differences regarding campus climate. The project's involvement on the continued enforcement and implementation of Title IX has had lasting effects, as well as its creation and distribution of educational materials related to sexual harassment. Since its formation, PSEW has spearheaded a number of initiatives advocating gender equity in higher education. PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 as part of a push to focus on women's issues throughout the programming of the AAC. Sandler left her position of leadership and the group was reconstituted as the Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW). Upon being absorbed into the AACU, PSEW's primary source of funding no longer came from grants, as they were able to receive funding from the AACU. Musil directed the program until its conclusion in 2012, as the AACU redefined its mission to incorporate issues of gender equity. Some important reports and projects that were created during Musil's tenure were the report \\"A Measure of Equity: Women's Progress in Higher Education (2008)\\" and the establishment of the Campus Women Lead, which offered workshops on women's leadership, and the Women's Leadership Project for Inclusive Excellence.

History Enescu composed his First Piano Quartet in 1909: the first movement in Sinaia, the remaining two movements in Paris. The work was completed on 10 December, just over a week prior to the concert for which it was premiered, in the series Soir√©es d'Art on 18 December 1909‚Äîa programme that also included the premiere of the already ten-year-old Octet for Strings. The score is dedicated to Mme Ephrussi, the wife of the Parisian banker Michel Ephrussi (; ; ). There were only two further performances of the Quartet in the composer's lifetime: on 18 May 1910, and again in 1933, both times with the composer at the piano. It seems likely that Enescu had doubts about the work and might have wished to revise the score. This never happened, however, and the Quartet remained unpublished until 1965, a decade after the composer's death (; ). Analysis The quartet is in three movements: * Allegro moderato * Andante mesto * Vivace The opening movement, a sonata-allegro in D major, starts with the principal theme presented in the unison‚Äîa device of which Enescu was fond. This theme resembles the first theme of Enescu's Wind Decet, composed three years earlier, but its development occasionally looks forward to the heterophony characteristic of Enescu's later style . The central Andante movement is a song form in the key of A-flat minor, a tritone away from the home key of the outer movements‚Äîa relationship that Enescu will explore again in the Second Symphony . The main theme is particularly expressive, with modal coloring, and is presented at the outset of the movement in the cello . The second theme group is largely derived from the first theme, but displays a scalewise melodic cell alternating semitones and whole tones, which will emerge as a full descending octatonic scale five bars after rehearsal 39. In the coda, the piano unexpectedly introduces the secondary theme of the first movement, which is the only cyclic feature found in this work . The finale is, like the opening movement, in sonata-allegro form, but opens unexpectedly in D minor rather than major . It possesses a relentless rhythmic pulsation which, together with a vigorous cheerfulness, serves well the traditional function of a finale, but also that of a scherzo, a movement this work lacks .

She later passed away in 1992.  Early life  Adams was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and had a sister, Margaret. At age 19, Adams married a Navy officer. Their only child, a son named Kenneth, was born two years later.  Illness  At age 24, in 1950, Adams contracted polio after the Georgia/Florida game where she caught a chill after crossing the river in a boat that night. The last time her sister saw her move was that night as she danced with her brother-in-law to Glenn Miller. She was an art major before getting married at Florida State University and had started art school in Jacksonville in 1950. She was working at the shipyard in Jacksonville at the time when she became ill. The disease totally destroyed and paralyzed all but a few facial and neck muscles. She spent a year and a half in a hospital in Jacksonville and another year and a half in a rehabilitation center in North Carolina. After this, Adams spent five years, spending up to 24 hours a day, inside an iron lung due to her inability to breathe on her own. Polio does not destroy the nerves so she still had feeling through her body. Her husband was unable to cope with Adams' disability, divorcing her three years after contracting the illness and he received primary custody of their son due to her hospitalization. Her parents cared for her during this time, and the March of Dimes (then the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis) provided financial and medical assistance. Under the care of the Central Carolina Convalescent Hospital, she lay in a rocking bed which helped her body, paralyzed from the neck down, breathe. Her mind was alert and she was given an adaptive device invented by Frank Reck and made by a dentist, Dr. Coble, that allowed her to type letters using her mouth. She was also fitted with an electric typewriter and given a page turner, made by Harry Doll of Western Electric Company, so that she could read a book by herself. The Southeastern Respiration and Rehabilitation Center in Augusta, Georgia, provided Adams with a corset breathing device, where a rubber bag mimicked the negative pressure needed to breathe so that she could spend four hours a day where she was free of the iron lung; additionally, the center had a unique rocking bed and mouth hose device that allowed her to sleep normally, which meant that she could spend twelve hours a day outside the iron lung. Despite this freedom, it was eight years before she was able to return to artistic pursuits. She told her sister Margaret that the \\"positive Pressure\\" machine allowed her to embrace her art again and allowed her to express herself. Margaret says Ann is the bravest person she has ever known.  Artistic career  Ann Adams, Winter Birds, made between 1958 and 1992 After she was able to sit up in a wheelchair with a breathing device, she trained herself to draw using a pencil held between her teeth with a mouth grip. An adjustable easel was set up to hold her paper and a tray for paints. She finished her first drawing of a chapel in the woods ten years after getting polio. Each of her works of art took about two months to complete. She made drawings and paintings that were used in Christmas cards, like Madonna and Child. She also made drawings for other greeting cards and was nationally known for that work. Some of the drawings included landscapes, puppies, and kittens. The drawings were printed and sold through her mail-order business. By 1972, she supported herself with her artwork, living in her own home, and traveling with a portable iron lung. She required constant care and was still spending her nights in an iron lung. She was still working in 1990. She encouraged other people with disabilities and enjoyed reading, listening to music, and cooking. Conversion to Roman Catholicism Adams was born in a Presbyterian family, but in 1956 converted and was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church.

The film was widely seen as getting onto the YouTuber film \\"trend\\", featuring other famous YouTubers such as Shanna Malcolm, Shira Lazar, Sara Fletcher and Ashley Clements.  Plot  The film centres around a young woman named Amy Tyler, who books a surprise holiday to Europe with her boyfriend Josh Merit. However, the two separate before they are able to go onto the trip; therefore, she advertises her tickets online in search for another man with an identical name to her ex-boyfriend to go on the tour instead. The story, although written in 2012, bore similarities to a 2014 case of a 28-year-old Toronto man named Jordan Axani, who offered up free tickets to on Reddit a girl named Elizabeth Gallagher, when he broke up with his girlfriend of the same name. Although his ticket had a strict no-transfer policy, as passport information was not required when booking, the ticket could be used by anyone with the same name. When a BuzzFeed article about the story became popular, the script was given \\"new life\\". Brendan Bradley said that \\"I wrote this script five years ago\\", Bradley said, \\"and everyone told me ... 'This would never happen! This is too unrealistic!' And the project didn‚Äôt get any traction because everyone thought the premise was too crazy. And then it happened in real life.\\"  Filmmaking model  Despite having minimal production money in and of themselves, Bradley and the film crew worked with Turkish tourist companies such as Turkish Airlines, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and VIP Tourism Agency, as well as working with Land Rover. These companies partially funded the trip, in exchange for featuring the airline, hotels and tourist attractions in the film. Brendan said he came up with the idea after reading Blockbusters by Anita Elberse, which explains why it's difficult for new filmmakers to enter the industry. This has been seen as a tactical move on by Turkish Airlines in order to encourage millennial tourism.

Also known as the Kimberley Gown, this formal dress is a mantua, a two-piece costume consisting of a draped open robe and a matching underskirt or petticoat, and has been dated to ca. 1690‚Äì1700.  Cut and structure  Mantua, back view The mantua or manteau was a new fashion that arose in the 1670s. The dresses of the previous period featured of a separate bodice and skirt. In contrast, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor. The earliest mantua was a loose gown worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and then into a dress worn looped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The Kimberley mantua reflects a development of the style in the 1690s, when the back was pleated to fit and the front edges of the overskirt were pulled up to the waistline at the center back. The skirt panels are cut in a curve to allow some sort of padding to be worn beneath. It is clear that the dress has been altered: \\"the gown's sleeves were shortened or otherwise reshaped by cutting. Either then or in more recent times the cuffs were restitched to make them narrower. It was in recent times that the main sleeve seams were taken in from I to 2 inches and that the side seams of the bodice, running from under the arms to the waist, were also taken in about 2 inches. The two pleats at the front of the bodice, and the pleats at the back, have been altered. It seems likely that the back showed only two pleats originally rather than four.\\" Costume historians Blanche Payne and Norah Waugh took cutting diagrams or patterns from the mantua, which appear as Draft 13a and B in Payne's History of Costume (1965) and as Diagram IX in Waugh's The Cut of Women's Clothes 1600-1930 (1968). Of the dress, Payne wrote \\"One must see it to appreciate it, and the more closely it is examined, the greater the admiration and respect it arouses.\\"  Materials  Detail of the striped wool and silver-gilt embroidery. Unlike the majority of surviving mantuas, which are made of the rich brocaded silks popular at the turn of the 18th century, the Kimberley mantua is a practical winter costume, made of striped woolen fabric embroidered with silver-gilt yarns. The fabric, sometimes described as broadcloth, is actually a \\"soft, fine, tabby-woven (over one, under one) woolen fabric that has been given a napped surface though not the dense, felted finish characteristic of broadcloth.\\" The background color is something between \\"brownish\\" and \\"warm grey\\". The stripes, woven parallel to the weft (across the width of the fabric), are \\"ultramarine\\" blue \\"bordered by vibrant terracotta\\" and \\"dark mustard yellow\\" \\"bordered by a pair of magenta stripes\\". The stripes are embroidered with a pattern of alternating four- and five- petaled blossoms on the blue stripes and leafy vines on the mustard stripes. In addition to the striped fabric and its small embroidered motifs, the lower part of the petticoat, to about knee-height, is decorated with an elaborate scrolling design in silver-gilt thread that suggests gold lace. The pattern is similar to lace panels of the period, and is strictly symmetrical, in keeping with the taste of the late Baroque. What appear to be original seams are sewn with two sewing silks, \\"one pale beige, not plied, the other dark brown and plied.\\" The mantua was subsequently altered, possibly to accommodate a taller wearer; many of these alterations are made with a \\"plied, ocher-colored sewing silk.\\"  Provenance  Kimberley Hall The mantua came to public notice in 1932, when it was exhibited in London at the Art Treasures Exhibition held at Christie, Manson and Woods from October I2 to November 5. The exhibitors, Acton, Surgey, Ltd., did not indicate a source for the gown in the catalogue, but they exhibited it with other items from Kimberley Hall, near Norwich, home of the Wodehouse family, and named Kimberley Hall as its source in later correspondence. The Met negotiated with Acton, Surgey that winter, and bought the gown, with income from the Rogers Fund, in April 1933.  References   External links  * * Mantua 33.54a, b at the Met.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was last of four partial eclipses that took place that year, two in the space of two months each, the last one was on July 1819 and covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. It was the last six of the solar saros 111 cycle of eclipses, the next one was on November 21, 1862 and the last one on January 5, 1935. Description The eclipse was visible in much of the peninsular portion of Antarctica and the surrounding islands except for the largest island within Antarctica and the northernmost point and the surrounding islands. The eclipse started at sunrise at about 40% of the way between South America and the Antarctic Circle and finished at sunset offshore from Antarctica east of the 180th meridian, all of it occurred in the Western Hemisphere. To the earth's surface, the Moon was going to the bottom in the north and then to the right as the axis was rotating east at around 70 south. It was 5% obscured in the middle of the peninsula up to 8.4% obscuration of the sun at the area of the greatest eclipse. The center of the moon's shadow was missed by over 2,500 km over the area (69.8 S) south of the Antarctic Circle. The greatest eclipse was in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles (or kilometers) northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula at 69.8 S and 119.3 W at 9:51 UTC (7:58 PM local time on November 9). The subsolar marking was in the Great Zimbabwe (now Zimbabwe) in Africa.

Born Marie-√âlisabeth Blavot and also known as Marie Monchablon in her youth (from her mother's name), she married the painter Cl√©ment Boulanger and then, after Boulanger's death, Edmond Cav√©‚Äîwhom she also outlived. Known as Madame Cav√© during the July Monarchy due to her husband's official duties, she was equally friendly with Neoclassicist admirers of Ingres and with Romantic painters such as Delacroix, with whom she was friends. After she was widowed, she taught drawing to young women and published two teaching pamphlets on drawing and colour during the Second French Empire. She later also published reflections on women's conduct and place in society. Life Born in Paris, she was the daughter of , and her family was related to that of Charles Leclerc, first husband of Pauline Bonaparte. She was raised at a boarding school for young girls, where she learned drawing and watercolour under Camille Roqueplan, then genre painting under Cl√©ment Boulanger, a student of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who painted Boulanger's portrait around 1830. She and Boulanger married in 1831‚Äîthey had had a son together in Rome the previous year named Albert. Delacroix's letters. Cautious, beautiful and charming, she managed to live an independent life and her career as a painter continued without interruption until 1855. From 1836 she gave lessons in drawing and painting in a school for young girls. In 1833 she met Eug√®ne Delacroix at a ball‚Äîfour years later he offered her a small painting, Charles Quint at the Monastery of Yuste (18 x 26 cm). She and Delacroix travelled to Flanders together in 1839 Delacroix's letters and they remained close until his death. Her husband was appointed artist to Charles Texier's archaeological mission, which was sent to excavate Magnesia ad Sipylum (now Manisa in Turkey). He died there on 28 September 1842Bellier 1:136 and the following year she married Edmond Cav√©, twelve years her senior. She continued teaching and writing, gaining a certain notoriety under the name Madame Cav√© and obtaining several official commissions to produce paintings for churches. Although her husband's position between 1843 and 1852 certainly proved useful to her artistic career, it was not the decisive influence upon it as some writers have argued. She effectively exhibited at the Paris Salon and gained critical acclaim before her marriage to Cav√© and her career and official commissions continued after the 1848 French Revolution had cost Cav√© his post and after Cav√©'s death in 1852. Other authors attribute her notoriety to her intimate relationship with Delacroix, though this too can be argued against‚Äîshe was in contact with the whole artistic milieu of her era and able to understand her artistic contemporaries as an artist herself. = Painting = She exhibited at the Paris Salon several times and gained quite a favourable critical reputation, though critics praised her for not stepping beyond her r√¥le and talent as a woman. She herself wrote in 1850 \\"for too often ideas of great painting, of history painting, as it's called in our own times, come to trouble [the minds of young girls]. The ambition to equal men, to compete with them, destroys them.\\"Le dessin sans ma√Ætre (Drawing without a master), page 18 In 1847 she exhibited paintings of children‚Äî\\"its touch is light and its colour luminous‚Äîshe likes beautiful shimmering fabrics and coquettish adjustments, and the luxury of ornaments of the old courts\\".Th√©ophile Thor√©, Le salon de 1847, Paris, Alliance des arts, 1847, p. 149 In 1863 she exhibited \\"lively watercolours, in high colour and with a wholly masculine energy\\" at the permanent exhibition organised from that year onwards.Edmond About, Derni√®res lettres d'un bon jeune homme √† sa cousine Madeleine, Paris, 1863, p. 143. = Teaching = She initially wrote a work on artistic training, Le dessin sans ma√Ætre (1850), which explained the Cav√© Method, which she said she had used since 1847. It aimed to exercise visual memory, a basic aptitude necessary for drawing.Marcellin Jobard claimed he had invented these methods based on training one's visual memory, ideas he had described in 1831 in La Revue des Revues. See Les Beaux-Arts, revue nouvelle, volume 2, 1 January to 15 June 1961, pp.76-78. Delacroix wrote a favourable review in the Revue des deux Mondes of September 1850. A commission examined the method in 1850 and decided in favour of it and Lecoq's method (inspired by the same concept). The Minister of Public Education trialled Cav√©'s method in normal primary schools in Caen and Douai in 1862 and later the same year in those in Chartres.¬´ M√©thode de dessin de Madame Cav√© ¬ª, Bulletin administratif, Minist√®re de l'instruction publique et des cultes, no 146, f√©vrier 1862, p. 37 The results were judged to be satisfactory enough to recommend adopting the method in other normal schools.¬´ M√©thode de dessin de Madame Cav√© ¬ª, Code r√©pertoire de la nouvelle l√©gislation sur l'instruction primaire. Instructions et circulaires minist√©rielles, Minist√®re de l'instruction publique et des cultes, 1866, p. 1002 The assessors' arguments in favour of drawing training did not change the fact that they saw it as a pastime rather than an industrial skill‚Äîit is still impossible to say how far these methods were applied, if not by their inventors. Madame Cav√© then wrote L'aquarelle sans ma√Ætre (Watercolour Without a Master), in which she discussed colour. These two small books combined a learning method, practical advice, reflections on the theoretical order of arts and crafts and moral treatments of women's place in society. The works she published later did not contain moral discussions‚Äîafter she was widowed she became a more and more fervent Roman Catholic, in a way similar to other figures born during the First Empire. She died in Neuilly- sur-Seine. =Charity work= Aged 60, she seems to have abandoned painting and in 1866 she founded a society aiming to relieve women who had fallen into poverty and \\"were not used to the misery\\" of living off a wage‚Äîthis was known as the \\"Corporation des abeilles\\" (\\"the Corporation of Bees\\"). They were able to produce \\"ouvrages de dame\\" (i.e. artworks suitable for women to produce) which could then be sold to society figures.Angrand 1966, p. 169 ; M.me Cav√©, Beaut√© physique de la femme, 1868 ; Hippolyte Nazet, \\"La Corporation des abeilles\\", Le Figaro, 2 June 1868, pp. 2‚Äì3 Appearances in fiction Alexandre Dumas (p√®re) made her a character in one of the chapters of his memoirs, published between 1852 and 1856, in which he interwove some facts agreeing with historical documents with other contradictory, incoherent and mostly unverifiable ones. He portrayed her as a mad romantic young woman, a married artist and cousin of her first husband Boulanger, to whom Dumas dedicated the chapter.

He graduated from Ohio University in August, 1940, with a Bachelor of Science in Commerce degree and from Northwestern University in August, 1941, with an MBA. In 1942, McClure married Helen Oppegard, a fellow Northwestern student. After serving with the U.S. Navy during World War II, McClure entered the newspaper business as an advertising executive and business manager for the Grand Forks Herald (ND). In July 1952, he had joined The Burlington Free Press (Vermont), and in 1961 became the newspaper's major owner and publisher. Following a 1952 divorce, he married Lois Howe Ricker of Burlington in 1954. In 1971, McClure sold his newspaper holdings (including the Chambersburg (PA) Public Opinion, purchased in 1964) to Gannett Co. Inc. The sale made McClure Gannett's largest individual stockholder, and he became Gannett's first vice president of marketing and was elected to the board of directors. McClure retired from Gannett in 1975 but continued to serve on their board. He then started McClure Media Marketing Motivation Company, which conducted marketing and motivational seminars throughout the country and Canada, and developed the Ener/Gem Success System.

It was chosen best Scandinavian fiction by the French literary magazine Transfuge.Brynja, 'Heimska valin besti skandinav√≠ski sk√°ldskapurinn', B√¶jarins besta (6 January 2017), http://gamli.bb.is/Pages/120/?NewsID=201563 . Summary The novel is written in the third person, making some use of free indirect discourse and occasional included texts such as an email, an essay, and a book review. It is divided into ten sections, and ninety-four short chapters. The action is set in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur, implicitly in the near future. In addition to social media prominent at the time of the novel's composition (Facebook, Instagram and Skype are all mentioned, for example), it is usual for people to install webcams throughout their homes, enabling others to watch them at will. Drones also serve as flying eyes. Despite this highly technologised setting, for much of the novel there are irregular, unexpected power-cuts. The main characters are √Åki and Len√≠ta Talbot, a narcissistic, sex-obsessed couple around their late thirties, who are also among Iceland's pre-eminent novelists, and whose fractious relationship has for most of their careers generated the artistic inspiration that each needs. Fairly significant appearances are also made by Len√≠ta's twin sister Tilda and Tilda's husband Rag√∫el. The novel begins by explaining that √Åki and Len√≠ta have separated. Each had just finished drafting a novel and revealed its content to the other. It turns out that both wrote a novel set in the early twenty-first century about a man called Akme√∞. In each, Akme√∞ migrates from a majority-Islamic country to Iceland as a youth. He becomes an Islamic-fundamentalist terrorist, joins ISIS, and fights in the Syrian Civil War, before being found dead in a house on Laugavegur. (Chapter XLVI, apparently a review of the books, partly reproduced on the cover of Heimska, provides explicit commentary on the pomposity of two white authors largely ignorant of Islam writing this story.) Although Heimska mentions that the publishers' lawyers conclude that there is no plagiarism case to bring, √Åki and Len√≠ta are each convinced that the other has stolen their idea, and √Åki moves out of their shared home into H√≥tel √çsafj√∂r√∞ur, establishing an office in a disused seafood factory nearby. Both enter a period of profound creative block and devote their energies to trying to hurt each other emotionally, principally by sending each other video footage of themselves having sex with other people. This activity comprises a significant part of the book. It includes Len√≠ta recording footage of a drunken √Åki having sex with a teenager called Mar√Ω Steinsd√≥ttir, which Len√≠ta posts on an internet pornography site. In revenge, √Åki posts footage of Len√≠ta having sex with a barman in Tenerife, Bob Bourequat. Around section 6 of the novel, Iceland experiences an extended power-cut; section 6 itself comprises a series of vignettes portraying different people around √çsafj√∂r√∞ur coping with the disappearance of electricity from their lives. The power-cut is followed by an email sent to most of the country's citizens claiming that one Birta S√≥llilja has cut the power in order to promote calmer lifestyles and a more viable future. Through a flashback, the novel then explains that the furore over the publications of the videos of √Åki and Len√≠ta having sex with Mar√Ω and Bob leads Mar√Ω and Bob themselves to meet and become a couple, while Mar√Ω is studying art in Reykjav√≠k. Their friend Drafbjartur √û√≥r Lie convinces them and another friend, Gu√∞r√∫n (Grun) Valsd√≥ttir, to help him with his final degree project. He has been inspired to emulate the terrorist plot which Akme√∞ is described to plan in √Åki's novel Akme√∞, which involves shutting down Iceland's power through computer hacking and physical destruction. The team successfully applies for a grant to hire the Finnish computer hacker Sirpa Hietala, whose politics are inspired by the controversial deep ecologist Pentti Linkola, and move to √çsafj√∂r√∞ur to undertake their artistic project, working in the same disused factory as √Åki. Following the power-cut, the police arrest Drafbjartur, Grun, Mar√Ω and Bob, and in unspecified circumstances kill Sirpa. However, they also believe that √Åki is part of the plot, and torture him when he (who has not even noticed Mar√Ω's presence at the factory) refuses to confess. He consequently dies in police custody, and the police successfully claim that the internal bleeding that caused his death was the consequence of √Åki's own dissolute lifestyle.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Syria and Turkey. It has white or pale greenish flowers, heavily covered with dark purple veins or dots, deep purple round signal and a beard of long brown/purple hairs. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description The forms of Iris kirkwoodiae are between Iris gatesii and the also dark-veined Iris sofarana.British Iris Society (1997) It is also very similar in form to Iris susiana. It has a stout and compact rhizome, which is stoloniferous and between long, underneath the rhizome are long secondary roots, which help feed the plant mineral salts from the soil. It has 6-7 leaves, which grow up tall and between wide, They are falcate, or sickle shaped. It is tall, growing up to between tall. It blooms between April and May, with large,Basak Gardner & Chris Gardner sphere-like flowers. It was determined that the plants found in Maras, Turkey seem to have the largest flowered forms. It has a faint pleasant scent. The flowers are between in diameter, and come in shades of beige, white or pale greenish ground, which is covered with violet, or dark purple veins and spots. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The standards are generally paler than the falls. The standards are long and are wide. The deflexed falls, have a deep purple round or obovate signal patch, and in the centre of the fall, is a sparse, purple or brownish-purple beard. Occasionally forms have a red-brown or yellow beard. It has style arms which have erect or reflexed lobes. After it has flowered, it produces a seed capsule that is about long. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted as 2n=20, by Avishai and Zohary in 1977. Taxonomy It is known as Maras kurtkulaƒüƒ± in Turkish. and it is written in Hebrew as ◊ê◊ô◊®◊ô◊° ◊ß◊ô◊®◊ß◊ï◊ï◊ì . Specimens of the iris were collected by E. K. Balls and also by S. Albury, M. Cheese, and J. Watson in 1966, from Bishmishly, Northern Syria and Amanus Mountains, Turkey. It was then originally described and published as Iris kirkwoodii in 'Botaniska Notiser', Vol.125 Issue 4 on page 499 in 1972. The specific epithet kirkwoodii, refers to Mrs Grace Kirkwood. A botanist along with Shaukat A. Chaudhary and Carolyne Weymouth first published and described other 'Section Oncocyclus' irises Iris assadiana and Iris swensoniana. With the standard form of G.Kirkw. It was later published in Davis, P.H. (ed.) (1984). Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands 8: 381-450. Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh. The spelling of the iris was corrected in accordance with Melbourne ICN Art. 60.12 and Rec. 60C.1(b) in 2011 to Iris kirkwoodiae, because Grace Kirkwood was a women but much of the older published literature has the old spelling as I. Kirkwoodii. Iris kirkwoodiae was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated 21 May 2013. Although Iris kirkwoodiiis listed in the RHS Plant Finder 2017 and it is a tentatively accepted name. In February 2016, several 'Section Oncocyclus' irises Iris paradoxa, Iris iberica, Iris barnumiae, I. kirkwoodiae, Iris sofarana were resolved as monophyletic. It has 2 synonyms that are often called subspecies of Iris kirkwoodiae; Iris kirkwoodiae ssp. calcarea, (or Iris calcerea,) and Iris kirkwoodiae ssp. macrotepala. Iris kirkwoodiae ssp. macrotepala is sometimes referred to as a variety, such as Iris kirkwoodiae var. macrotepala. Having longer leaves and slightly different flowers, it was also published in 1976 in 'Bot. Not.' Vol.128: Distribution and habitat Iris kirkwoodii is native to temperate areas of western Asia. =Range= It is found in Syria, (near Aleppo, Bismishly and el Bara,) Turkey, (within the districts of Maras, Gazintep and Hatay,) and Lebanon. =Habitat= It grows on the limestone rocks, and stones, and between cultivated fields. It is normally found at above sea level. Conservation The plant is considered 'rare, as its natural habitat on Mount Ahƒ±r is threatened with destruction, due to the construction of houses and associated effects, road construction and the alteration to vineyards and gardens. Cultivation It likes to grow in rocky soils, which stay dry in summer. Hybrids and cultivars Iris kirkwoodii has several known crosses, such as: 'Code Of Silence', 'Delicate Embroidery', 'Diamond Tiara', 'Engraved Invitation' (I. calcarea x I. yebrudii v. edgecombii), 'Known Only To Him', 'Prim And Proper'. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Other sources * Davis, P. H., ed.

She joined the company in 2008 as CFO, and Patagonia's profits have tripled since then. After she was hired, she evaluated Patagonia's production processes and revised them to be more environmentally friendly, by eliminating waste and excess packaging materials. Prior to joining Patagonia, Marcario spent 15 years in private equity. She earned a BS in Business and Finance from the University of Albany and an MBA at California State University, Los Angeles. She currently serves on the Board of Trustees at Naropa University.  Employee child care facilities  Marcario has been a vocal supporter of on- site child care, which Patagonia established in 1983. Under her leadership, 100 percent of the company's working mothers have returned to work after giving birth. On June 1, 2017, Marcario opened an on-site child care facility at Patagonia's distribution center in Reno, Nevada. Marcario believes that employer-operated child care facilities are the answer to getting more women on company boards and in CEO positions.  Politics  In February, 2016, Marcario and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard made a public statement about the company's commitment to public lands by choosing to withdraw the company's participation from the annual Outdoor Retailer show trade show. The show was hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Marcario and Chouinard said they were protesting Utah Governor Gary Herbert's attempts to rescind the Bears Ears National Monument. Marcario is often a spokeswoman for Patagonia's stance on public lands, and other outdoor industry companies often follow the lead of Patagonia. Her decision to use the company's participation in Outdoor Retailer as a bargaining tool to change Herbert's stance on public lands spurred a boycott of the trade show, which put the $887 billion outdoor recreation industry into the national spotlight. Marcario and Patagonia said the brand would boycott the show, one of Salt Lake City's most profitable annual conventions, unless the state's elected officials backed down on their efforts to rescind Bears Ears. Many other companies said they, too, would boycott the show in solidarity with Patagonia, which caused Outdoor Retailer and the Outdoor Industry Association to seek a new home for the show in a state deemed more friendly to public lands. Patagonia has sought to mobilize its customers over Trump's executive order to reduce some national monuments, particularly Bears Ears National Monument, and has sued the Trump administration over the matter.David Gelles. \\"Patagonia v. Trump\\". The New York Times, May 5, 2018. Marcario closed Patagonia's doors on Election Day in 2016 to raise awareness about the importance of voting. Four days after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, she spoke out against the Trump administration in defense of public lands and the fight against climate change.  Departure from Patagonia  On June 10, 2020, Marcario announced she was stepping down as President and Chief Executive Officer of Patagonia, effective June 12, 2020.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The site is significant because it represents much of what is understood about Woodland period life in the region. The Hacklander site is a large multi-component Middle Woodland period site, likely representing an ongoing seasonal occupation of the site. It was discovered in the 1960s. Over two years of excavations, researchers discovered more than 20,000 ceramic potsherds, as well as 80,000 stone artifacts (including Woodland points) and debitage. Construction of a river access site by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources at the location has had a major impact on the site.

He was born at Turin, the son of Giovanni, count of Lavriano, and Anna Maria Re.Marina Velo, \\"Ferrero, Francesco Maria\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 47 (Rome: Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1997). Ferrero di Lavriano's portrait of his contemporary, Victor Amadeus II. In 1702, he published a collection of fine etchings of the rulers of Savoy, the Augustae regiaeque Sabaudae domus Arbor gentilitia regiae celsitudini Victori Amedeo II in Turin. On 3 June 1707, he was appointed royal bursar of the provinces of Alessandria, Lomellina, Valle di Sesia and Valenza, charged with administering vacant benefices. This was a new office at the time, and Ferrero was the first such officer appointed. On 8 June, Duke Victor Amadeus II sent Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani to Rome to obtain for Ferrero from Pope Clement XI the right to collect the revenues otherwise owed to the Apostolic Camera from vacant ecclesiastical benefices in the same provinces. Grimani delayed his departure, however, and Ferrero assumed the revenues without official authorization, thus prompting a dispute with the bishop of Novara. The matter was not finally cleared up until November 1712. He composed two detailed volumes on his work as a royal bursar, both now in the Royal Library of Turin: Memorie concernenti l'Economato regio, ricavate dagli Archivi del Senato e dai registri della Cancelleria dell'Economato di Milano and Istoria dell'Economato regio o sia Relazione distinta di tutti i successi seguiti pendente l'amministrazione di quest'officio dal 1707 al 1718 inclusivamente. He was a copious collector of documents relating to ecclesiastical benefices: imperial diplomas, papal concessions, nuptial agreements, treaties, most of which found their way into the Royal Library of Turin. In 1712, he published at Turin the Istoria dell'augusta citt√† di Torino, which was a continuation of the history of Turin written by Emanuele Tesauro (died 1675). A copy was presented to Victor Amadeus by city leaders in 1713 to mark the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, the favourable ending of the War of the Spanish Succession‚Äîespecially the siege of Turin in 1706‚Äîand Victor Amadeus' acquisition of a royal crown, that of Sicily. In 1717 he took over the provostship of Moncenisio. He renounced it in 1727 and became titular abbot of Santo Stefano in Ivrea in 1728. In 1718, he had helped the abbot of Santo Stefano, T. A. De Rossi, in settling a dispute with the Noble Consortium of the Fief of Passerano over the right to perform religious services. On 15 November 1720, Victor Amadeus nominated him one of the reformers of the University of Turin, praising him for his prudence and skill. Some of his ideas on reform can be found in the letter he wrote to the secretary of state G. L. Raiberti dated 21 July 1721. In 1722, he published Gli elementi della lingua toscana in Cologne, Germany. He died at Turin between 20 and 28 February 1730.

Unlike the rival dictionary of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, finally published in 1694, Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire included specialized technical and scientific vocabulary. It was also an encyclopedia of sorts in dealing with things as well as words. Despite having been banned in France, it was a commercial success and exerted an enormous influence on eighteenth-century French dictionaries and encyclopedias. Origins and Publication At the time of its founding, the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise had been entrusted with the task of producing a complete dictionary of the French language.John Considine, Academy Dictionaries, 1600-1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), 30-31. At first, Fureti√®re participated in the collaborative project with enthusiasm, but he eventually grew frustrated with his colleagues' approach and slow progress and began work on his own dictionary, probably around 1676-78.Alain Rey, \\"Antoine Fureti√®re, imagier de la culture classique,\\" vol. 1 of Le Dictionnaire universel d'Antoine Fureti√®re, facsimile edition (Paris: SNL - Le Robert, 1978), 54. In 1684 he published a sample of articles from his proposed dictionary under the title Essais d'un Dictionnaire universel. This work was reprinted in 1685 and 1687.Dorothea Behnke. Fureti√®re und Tr√©voux: Eine Untersuchung zum Verh√§ltnis der beiden W√∂rterbuchserien (T√ºbingen: Max Niemeyer, 1996), 9-14. When members of the academy heard that Fureti√®re was about to publish his dictionary, they interfered, alleging that he had stolen their material and violated the monopoly they had held on French dictionaries since 1674.Considine, Academy Dictionaries, 38. In 1685, after fierce recriminations on both sides, Fureti√®re was expelled from the academy, and the French government revoked his permission to publish the dictionary. In 1690, the Dictionaire universel was published posthumously in the Netherlands with a preface by Pierre Bayle, who had helped arrange for the work's publication.Walter W. Ross, \\"Antoine Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire universel,\\" in Notable Encyclopedias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: Nine Predecessors of the Encyclop√©die (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1981), 56-59. Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire continued to be edited and republished through 1727. The second edition (1701) and the third edition (1708) were revised and improved by the Protestant jurist Henri Basnage de Beauval (1656‚Äì1710). A fourth edition, edited by Jean-Baptiste Brutel de la Rivi√®re, appeared in 1727. * 1690 : Dictionaire universel. The Hague and Rotterdam: Arnoud et Reinier Leers. First edition. 3 volumes.

Fourth edition. 4 volumes. Edited by Jean-Baptiste Brutel de la Rivi√®re. The Reuse of Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire by the Encyclopedists of Tr√©voux In 1704, a three-volume encyclopedia was published outside Lyon at Tr√©voux, then the capital of Dombes, under the title of Dictionnaire universel fran√ßois et latin. It was different from Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire in two main respects. First, as its title indicated, it included a bilingual dictionary of French and Latin in the final volume. Second, the anonymous authors attempted to re- Catholicize the Dutch-published encyclopedia and cleanse it of Protestant notions. Otherwise, the Dictionnaire de Tr√©voux, as it came to be known, was nearly identical to the 1701 edition of Fureti√®re's Dictionnaire,Behnke, Fureti√®re und Tr√©voux, 104-20. a source of outrage to Basnage, who thought that his and Fureti√®re's work should have been acknowledged. The Dictionnaire de Tr√©voux continued to be published through 1771. Despite repeated denials on the part of the Jesuits, it seems clear that they were largely responsible for production of the encyclopedia at least prior to the suppression of the Jesuits in France in 1763.Marie Leca-Tsiomis, √âcrire l‚ÄôEncyclop√©die: Diderot: De l‚Äôusage des dictionnaires √† la grammaire philosophique (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1999), 75-84, 139-42.

When Flanner died in 1912 and the organization fell on financial hardships, they changed the name from Flanner Guild to Flanner House and added many services with the financial assistance from the Christian Woman's Board of Missions. The organization continues to assist senior citizens, those in financial straits, families, children and much more. History =Frank Flanner and Flanner Guild= Flanner House was named after Frank Flanner (1854‚Äì1912), a local philanthropist and mortician. In 1898, he donated a piece of property containing two buildings to the Charity Organization Society, a group operating a social settlement for the city's white population. The purpose of this gift was to create an African-American community service center. This became the first settlement house, called Flanner Guild, for African-Americans in the city. The organization was incorporated in 1903 and within a short time the main building was built in what is presently Lockefield Gardens. The purpose of the organization was to promote the social, moral, and physical welfare of the African-American community through the establishment and maintenance of academic and vocational education and self-help programs benefiting the surrounding community. Flanner Guild began operations in a small building on Colton Street under the direction of Sarah Colton Smith. The early programs of the organization were divided into several departments and included Employment, Recreation, Vocational Aids, Music, and a Day Nursery. One of Flanner Guild's first projects was the creation of a rescue home for unwed mothers and their children in 1908. =Flanner House= After Flanner's death in 1912, the agency faced financial difficulties that caused the Board of Directors to turn to the Christian Woman's Board of Missions for support. The Board was reorganized and the name of the organization was changed from Flanner Guild to Flanner House. Support received from the Board of Missions allowed Flanner House to continue operations and purchase a new facility by 1918. The new location at the corner of West and St. Clair Streets was purchased, remodeled and equipped with four buildings allowing for the creation of additional services including health clinics for tuberculosis and child care, a make over shop for clothing and furniture, and training classes through the Red Cross. Flanner House was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in 1935. In 1936, Cleo Blackburn began his tenure as Superintendent of Flanner House. Blackburn's primary goals included teaching individuals to achieve personal, economic and social progress. Under his leadership as Superintendent (1936-1975), a new facility was built and opened in 1944 at 16th and Missouri Streets (333 West 16th Street) as a result of the \\"Indianapolis Study.\\" This study, an analysis of the city's black population, began in 1937 with a grant from the Indianapolis Foundation. Completed in 1939, the study gave the city's first complete survey of the financial, educational, cultural, and medical background of its black population. Cleo Blackburn developed several dynamic programs that gave Flanner House national attention. Among those was his self- help housing project that began in 1946 called Flanner Homes, Inc. The project became a national model for providing local and federal funding to help low- income black war veterans (the first project participants) build their own homes. Developed with the support of the American Friends Service Committee, the Marshall Field Foundation, and Rosenwald Fund Support Division of Self- Help, the project helped revitalize the homes of the area while participants received free training house construction. Also developed in 1946, was the Herman G. Morgan Health Center. This center was constructed with support from the Indianapolis Foundation and Indianapolis Board of Health and Hospitals. The program was unique because it was the only structure in the state of Indiana designed and constructed to provide preventive medicine and a public health program to the community it served. The services of the Health Center included annual physical examinations and immunizations as well as consultation and instruction in proper nutrition. Organized by Cleo Blackburn in 1954, the Board of Fundamental Education was a nationally recognized experiment that built responsible citizens by teaching and encouraging their pride and initiative. Flanner House, in cooperation with other agencies (including Indiana University and Purdue University), improved and extended its services and became a national demonstration center of the Fundamental Education program. As a result, Blackburn received a congressional charter and obtained several large federal grants for the educational and health needs of the underprivileged. In 1967, Flanner House moved to 2110 North Illinois Street and in 1979 to its present location at 2424 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street. During the 1960s, the employment placement services were discontinued since this service fell under the jurisdiction of Marion County. Flanner House continued offering employment classes and added programs through Family Services and the Marion County Welfare Department. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Flanner House continued to add programs targeted at the specific needs of the community it served, including assistance to homebound senior citizens, a residential youth center with case referrals from the juvenile courts, and the addition of a branch of the Marion County Public Library in 1979. In 1987, Flanner House became a member of Community Centers of Indianapolis, Inc. (CCI), a federation of neighborhood multi-service centers located in Indianapolis. Today, Flanner House continues its mission of service and self- help through, senior citizen services, assistance programs for those in financial need, the Food Justice program, which includes the F.E.E.D. program and the Flanner Farm. Flanner House provides Economic Development initiatives that include a Great Places designation, and the Northwest Area Quality of Life initiative. There also is the Flanner House Child Development Center which provides care, and education for toddlers, and pre-school children. There is a Before and After Care program providing safe place care, and education for school-aged, and adolescent children. The agency also provides a Health and Wellness program through the onsite branch of the Center of Wellness for Urban Women. Flanner House is also a location for the Center for Working Families providing life skills, job readiness, and employment services through its unique Skills to Success program. Cleo's Bodega & Cafe = Cleo's Bodega & Cafe = Located within the North West Area (NWA) of Indianapolis, Cleo's Bodega & Cafe serves as a food access hub for the community. The NWA is the largest food desert in Indianapolis. While also taking on the issue of food security, this project is a Workforce Development initiative with a commitment that the people who work in the store will be hired from the neighborhood and community through the Flanner House Community Center for Working Families Program. The store also serves as a place where not only produce from Flanner Farms, & Brandywine Creek Farms organic farming, is sold.

In 1992, he released his second solo album, We Are the Majority. As of 1996, it had sold 350,000 copies worldwide. The NME once called him \\"A ludicrously talented maestro\\". Dave Marsh wrote in PLAYBOY \\"If there‚Äôs a cure for Morrissey, this is it\\". Muller later co-founded, together with Jack Rieley, the internet company JFAX, later renamed to j2 Global (), which initially allowed its users to receive fax and voicemail through their email, one of the first unified messaging systems. M√ºller is no longer active in the company since 2004, but remained shareholder until 2016. Musical career Born in East Berlin, Muller (then M√ºller) left East-Germany for Paris, France in May 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but prior to German unification. Muller‚Äôs mother encouraged Jaye early on to take up music, in the form of classic guitar. She sent him to a local music school. Soon, Muller decided to also take up drums, bass and electric guitar. Before leaving East Germany, Muller played as drummer in the East Berlin underground bands kleinkariert and later in die anderen in the mid 80s. In March 1992, he signed a contract with PolyGram in Paris, France. Later that year, he used some of the money from this contract to start the weekly newsletter Germany Alert, which chronicled neo-Nazi activity and warned of human rights abuses in Germany at the time. Muller was nominated for the Reebok Human Right Award for this work. In 1992, J. was the victim of a home invasion and robbery by three thugs in his apartment. The robbers stole everything they could find pertaining to J.'s music, but no valuables. As of January 1993, the identities of the robbers were still unknown, but J. suspected they were neo-Nazis. In January 1993, he also released his second solo album, We Are the Majority, in the United States on A&M; Records. It had previously been released in France in October 1992. In interviews, Muller expressed his views that the German government should somewhat restrict their people's freedom of speech to prevent violent fascism from experiencing a resurgence there, after the German Unification/Annexation of East Germany. He titled his album We Are the Majority to serve as a rallying cry to those in Germany who did not want their country to succumb to right-wing extremists again, but who felt they could do nothing about it. As he told the New York Times, M√ºller released several other solo albums as well as albums in partnership as the duo \\"Muller and Patton\\". In 2015 Muller released a rock album \\"Bandages Cover The Looting\\" under the name \\"Count Jaye & The Hard Beats\\" co-produced by M√ºller himself and industry veteran Morris D. Temple. This was followed up with Count Jaye & The Hard Beats' second release in 2019 named \\"Hippo Russian Pickle Giant Blue Disguise. The first single's video of the album for the song \\"Big TV Star\\" caused some controversy as it portrayed the mainstream media as \\"Fake News\\", but left out FOX in the accusation. The album included collaborations by Andy Chester of My Computer, Adam Marsland of Cockeyed Ghost, Roger Joseph Manning Jr. of Jellyfish, Nuno Bettencourt of Extreme, Jack Rieley of the Beach Boys, Ben Patton, Filipino singer Rio and others. In 2018 Jaye and his wife, singer Michelle Omba, created the live music venue FLASHER FACTORY in the Philippines, for original music only, with great success. In 2020 the FLASHER FACTORY concept is being expanded into a fully fledged live recording studio complex located in Lapu Lapu City, Philippines. Critical reception Fortune magazine wrote \\"Jaye Muller is a total babe\\". Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times called the music of We Are the Majority \\"a solid, one-man-band rap-rock collection reminiscent of the Dutch group Urban Dance Squad.\\" In a 4-star (out of 5) review, AllMusic's Roch Parisien called the album \\"A disc that helps tear down that intimidating wall that separates rap and rock.\\" Billboard wrote that \\"tracks like \\"Keep the Promise\\" and \\"Born on the Wrong Side of Town\\" \\"successfully incorporate elements of rap, rock, funk, and pop.\\" Aron Gibson of BandRumors wrote about the first Count Jaye album: \\"Jaye Muller, the charismatic German songwriter, frontman and accidental tech pioneer who shot to fame in the early 90s with his seminal record We Are The Majority, is back...\\" \\"Muller, who had made waves across Europe on shows like MTV Europe and who also made a splash on American TV...\\" \\"The rocky but Beatlesque sounding songs are ‚Äúraw and dirty‚Äù indeed but are also well crafted. The lack of autotuned vocals is apparent at times but welcome in today‚Äôs world of overproduced pop perfection.\\" Business career With his manager, Jack Rieley, he went on to co-found the company JFAX Personal Telecom Inc. (now j2 Global) in 1995. The company allowed users to receive numerous types of media through email, including not only emails, but also faxes and voice messages. It did this by assigning each customer a phone number that received voice messages and faxes, then rerouts them to an email account. He got the idea for the company when he missed his faxes while traveling to different locations on tour. In 2000, Muller was nominated for the \\"Entrepreneur Of The Year Award\\". He later chose Richard Ressler to be the CEO of JFAX.

Her father died bankrupted and her sisters swiftly married to support themselves; but she chose to become a governess. She corresponded with the poet Johan Elers. In 1793 she inherited a fortune from a relative. In accordance with the Civil Code of 1734, unmarried women were legal minors under the guardianship of their closest male relative for life and could not handle their own money, but they could have themselves declared of legal majority by a petition to the monarch, which was a common procedure for unmarried business women. Caroline Gother had herself declared of legal majority on 22 November of that year, and engaged in business. She used her fortune by managing her own bank, investing her money in real estate and speculated in business, buying shares. She was successful and reportedly managed to use her inherited fortune to create another one, and was at her death described as one of the richest women in Sweden.

(formerly Harold L. Oram, Inc.) was founded in 1939 as a fund raising and public relations consulting firm specializing in liberal social causes. Early clients of the Group addressed social and political issues including human and civil rights, the environment, nuclear weapons, and refugee relief. Today, the Oram Group, Inc. continues to serve the non-profit organization in the areas of religion, social action, health, civil rights, the environment, and performing arts. Founder The firm's founder, Harold Leon Oram, was born on December 2, 1907 in Butler, Pennsylvania to Austro- Hungarian immigrants, Samuel and Freda (Ginzler) Oram. After graduation from Butler High School, he spent two years at the University of Miami in Florida majoring in history and economics. In 1934, he earned a law degree from New York Law School, but appears never to have practiced law In 1930, Oram began a journalism career in Texas. His first venture, a weekly paper called the Fort Worth Monitor, partnered him with Leopold Mamolen. When the newspaper failed, he left Texas and went to work for newspapers in Hartsdale and Brooklyn, New York while he attending law school. In 1936, Oram began working with the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, an activist group committed to the Loyalist side in Spain's Civil War. When that organization split, Oram joined the group's liberal faction that included Ralph Bates, Varian Fry, and Roger Baldwin and helped form the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign. As Director of Publicity and Fund Raising for the organization, Oram was responsible for obtaining funds for relocating Spanish Loyalists who fled Spain following General Francisco Franco's victory.  Harold L.Oram, Inc.  In September 1939, Oram started a fund raising firm called Consultants in Fund Raising. Shortly afterward, he changed the name to Harold L. Oram, Inc. The firm's early clients were devoted to aiding victims of social injustice. Clients included the Emergency Rescue Committee (predecessor to the International Rescue and Relief Committee), an organization that helped anti-Nazi intellectuals and political leaders escape Europe following the fall of France during World War II. Another client, the National Sharecroppers Fund, sought to improve the conditions for tenant farmers and migrant workers in the United States. A third client from the early 1940s, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, sponsored the legal assault on segregation. Oram's first employees were women, Eileen Fry (wife of Varian Fry) and Anna Frank Loeb, who had also met Oram through the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign. Eve Bates (wife of Ralph Bates), another friend from the days of the Spanish Refugee Campaign, became a part of the firm in 1941. In 1942, Oram left to serve in the army during World War II, leaving them to manage the firm. When he returned from the army in 1946, Oram's business began to expand. At first, most of the firm's clients were associated with efforts to recover from the effects of World War II and to combat the spread of Communism. They included the American Association for the United Nations, the Citizens Committee for the Marshall Plan, and the Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign. Gradually the list began to include causes concerned with environmental, educational, and health issues. During the 1950s and early 1960s, he represented a number of anti-Communist Asian causes, including the American Friends of Vietnam, Aid Refugee Chinese Intellectuals, Inc., the Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Red China to the United Nations, and the Dr. Tom Dooley Foundation. Oram also handled public relations in the United States for the Republic of South Vietnam during the late 1950s.  1960s  During the 1960s and 1970s, the organization to expanded into new fund raising areas including the arts, education, and environmental campaigns. Beginning in the 1960s, Oram began raising money, through capital fund campaigns, for buildings and institutions as well as causes. Two of the earliest capital fund campaigns were designed for the Hampton Institute and Goodwill Industries of Greater New York. As the clientele of the organization made a gradual shift, so did the internal operations. The Oram firm had expanded into several branches and associate offices and found itself in a new era when the company's founder retired. In the course of his career, Oram was responsible for a number of novel fund raising techniques. He pioneered modern direct mail appeal methods, collecting and compiling lists of donors in the days before such lists were bought and sold wholesale. Once, when a suitable list was unavailable, he used Who's Who as a mailing list. Oram is reputed to be the first to take out full-page advertisements in prestigious newspapers, such as The New York Times, for their value as stuffers in direct mail appeals. Another early tactic he employed involved telegrams. Taking advantage of the sense of urgency a telegram conveyed, he first sent them to important and wealthy individuals inviting them to contribute funds to the client's particular cause. Later, he sent telegrams as urgent invitations to attend convocations (another Oram innovation) combining information sessions and fund raising events for his clients. Henry Goldstein, a long-time member of the Oram firm, purchased the company in 1977. Goldstein, a native of New York, entered the fund raising field in the mid-1950s. His first fund raising job was with the United Community Chest of Paterson, New Jersey,and he came to Harold L. Oram, Inc. in 1964. Shortly after Goldstein joined, the organization began to expand. A subsidiary, Oram Associates, was formed to handle capital campaigns, under the guidance of Goldstein and Sidney W. Green. When Green departed, the subsidiary became Oram-Goldstein Associates. Soon, there were other subsidiaries:. Constituency Builders, Inc. (CBI) handled the direct mail campaigns, and Rusk and Oram focused on annual giving. By the time Goldstein purchased the organization in 1977, it consisted of three corporations: the Oram Group, Oram International Corporation, and CBI. Goldstein merged the three into one corporation, Oram Group, Inc. After Goldstein's purchase of the firm, he continued the traditional fundraising that served as its foundation from the beginning, but began a gradual shi to also provide consultation to the client organizations,with traditional fund raising just one piece of the firm's service to an organization. The Oram Group, Inc. now operates out of two offices in New York and California. Areas of consultation include management counsel for successful interaction within an organization, fund development counsel from planning through implementation of a fundraising campaign, board development, planning studies, organizational assessments, and senior executive search t.

He is the grandson of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and is one of the most prominent supporters of the Titoist legacy within the former Yugoslavia. Broz has led Serbia's Communist Party since its formation in 2009 and has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2016, sitting with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) parliamentary group. Background and private career Broz was born in Belgrade, then part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He is the eldest son of Tito's son ≈Ωarko Broz and Tamara Veger, a Russian. He has a degree from the Belgrade University Faculty of Forest Management, and at different times worked at military game preserves (where he learned to cook wild game) and as a forester, metal worker, and policeman in charge of security for his grandfather.\\"Serbian newspaper profiles Tito's grandson, Communist Party leader,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 2 December 2009 (Source: Glas javnosti, Belgrade, in Serbian 29 Nov 09); \\"Tito's grandson registers Communist party in Serbia,\\" Agence France-Presse, 6 December 2010. Although he was in frequent contact with Tito, he was not raised in affluent conditions and did not become wealthy by inheritance; a 2002 newspaper profile described him as living in a small, dilapidated house in Belgrade's Dedinje area and working as a cook in Zemun. \\"I am not sorry because the family has nothing,\\" he was quoted as saying. \\"My grandpa raised me to be a modest man, not different from ordinary people.\\" He added that his modesty helped him to survive the tragedies that befell Serbia and Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Vesna Peric Zimonjic, \\"Tito's family fight to recover his belongings from the state,\\" The Independent, 26 September 2002, p. 14. Broz has consistently defended Tito's political legacy and rejected charges that his grandfather was a dictator. At a memorial ceremony for Tito in 2000, he told an interviewer that his grandfather had permitted the 1968 student demonstrations in Yugoslavia to take place and addressed the issues behind the protests by political means. During the same interview, he remarked that Tito confided to him in 1978 that his greatest mistake was allowing nationalists in Yugoslavia to present their beliefs for public discussion.\\"Anniversary of Tito's death marked in Belgrade,\\" IPR Strategic Information Database, 8 May 2000. Broz later welcomed the founding of the (ceremonial) \\"Republic of Titoslavia\\" in Rakovica, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005; he was quoted as saying, \\"This does not reflect some fashion trend or nostalgic feelings about Tito's state, which has been and forever gone. This reflects nostalgia about the time when we all lived well, when we all, generally, lived happy and dignified lives. Today, we are nobody and nothing.\\"\\"\\"Republic of Titoslavia\\" founded in Bosnian park,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 20 May 2005 (Source: SRNA news agency, Bijeljina, in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian 1236 gmt 20 May 05). In 2010, he said that the Tito years were ‚Äúa time of safety and security; a working father could support a whole family, education and healthcare was free for all [and] Yugoslavia had a good reputation around the globe.‚Äù\\"Legacy that lives in the Balkans,\\" The Statesman, 5 May 2010.

He used Tito's image and the motto, \\"Where I stopped, you continue,\\" in the campaign.\\"Tito's grandson registers Communist party in Serbia,\\" Agence France Presse, 6 December 2010. He subsequently withdrew from the contest, however, and did not appear on the candidate list of any party or alliance.There was a four-party coalition that went by the name, \\"–û–î–ë–†–ê–ù–ê –ò –ü–†–ê–í–î–ê - –í–£–ö –û–ë–†–ê–î–û–í–ò–ã –ò –ë–û–†–ò–í–û–à–ï –ë–û–†–û–í–ò–ã (–°–æ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–ª–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—ò–∞, –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞, –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∫–∞ —Ä–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –ø–µ–Ω–∑–∏–æ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞ - –°–†–ü –∏ –°–æ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–ª–¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—ò–∞ –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—Ö,\\" in this electoral cycle.

He played a pivotal role in Ismail I's conquests and expansion in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, and functioned as governor of the Diyarbakr Province from 1506 to 1514. Mohammad Khan was killed while serving as a commander at the Battle of Chaldiran. Biography Mohammad Khan Ustajlu was a son of Mirza Beg Ustajlu, and had three brothers; Owlash Beg Ustajlu, Evaz Beg Ustajlu and Qara Beg Ustajlu. He was married to one of king Ismail I's sisters. When Ismail I returned to Khoy in 1506, after some skirmishes with 'Ala' al-Dowleh, the ruler of the Zu'l-Qadr, he appointed Mohammad Khan Ustajlu as the new governor (hakem) of Diyarbakr. About two months before the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514), Ottoman Sultan Selim I (1511‚Äì1520) and his army had reached the town of Sivas. Aware of the massive approach, Mohammad Khan Ustajlu, during his retreat from his governoral seat in Diyarbakr, devastated the area, which slowed the Ottoman progress towards the east in the ensuing weeks to come. On 23 August 1514, the day the decisive battle took place, Mohammad Khan Ustajlu and Nur-Ali Khalifa were the two Safavid commanders who had first-hand experience with the Ottomans ways of warfare. They both advised to attack at once, in order to prevent the Ottoman's from establishing their proper defensive positions. Mohammad Khan also counseled against a frontal attack due to the strength of the Ottoman artillery. This advice however, was rejected by both Durmish Khan Shamlu as well as by the king himself. Durmish Khan, a high-ranking member of the Qizilbash and a prominent figure at court because of his connections, rudely rebuffed Mohammad Khan and Nur-Ali Khalifa. Durmish Khan considered it \\"cowardly to engage an unprepared enemy\\". Ismail I chose to endorse Durmish Khan Shamlu's suggestion for the attack and thus the Ottomans were allowed to prepare their defenses at their leisure. This would prove costly, contributing to the sound Safavid defeat at Chaldiran. Mohammad Khan, who was in command of the left wing of the Safavid army, was killed, and his men fell in disarray.

In may 1971 command responsibility for naval staff in the dockyard was merged into the wider local command structure, initially under the dual designation of Flag Officer, Portsmouth and Admiral Superintendent, Portsmouth Mackie, Colin, (2017), Royal Navy Senior Appointments, Gulabin, pp. 101-102. but in July 1971 was again renamed Flag Officer Spithead and Port Admiral Portsmouth after a couple of months.

History From 1546 until 1832 prime responsibility for administering H.M. Royal Navy Dockyards lay with the Navy Board, and resident commissioners who were naval officers though civilian employees of the Navy Board, not sea officers in charge of the day-to-day operational running of the dockyard and superintendence of its sea officer and ratings staff, following the abolition of that board its functions were merged within the Admiralty and a new post styled Admiral-superintendent was established the admiral-superintendent usually held the rank of rear-admiral though sometimes commodore and vice-admiral. His immediate subordinate was an officer known as the captain of the dockyard (or captain of the port from 1969). This followed the appointment of a (civilian) Chief Executive of the Royal Dockyards in September 1969 and the creation of a centralised Royal Dockyards Management Board that were responsible for the civilian functions and staff at dockyards. Admiral-superintendents ceased to be appointed in the royal navy after 15 September 1971, and existing post-holders were renamed port admirals. In May 1971 the post holder was given wider responsibilities and the additional title of Flag Officer, Portsmouth and along with Admiral- superintendent, Portsmouth until July 1971 when Flag Officer, Portsmouth's title was renamed Flag Officer, Spithead and Admiral-superintendent, Portsmouth became Port Admiral Portsmouth until August 1975 when the name was changed again to Flag Officer, Portsmouth and Port Admiral Portsmouth until October 1996, when it ceased to exist as a separate formation that was then absorbed into the Flag Officer First Flotilla's responsibilities, later renamed Portsmouth Flotilla.

Prelude Following the conclusion of Operation Tulsa, BG William E. DePuy kept Col. Sidney Berry's 1st Brigade in the field hoping to repeat the success of the Battle of Minh Thanh Road by establishing firebases in the area and then sending convoys along Highway 13 and the Minh Thanh Road to invite attack by the Viet Cong (VC). Operation From 18 October 1st Brigade sent units from its base at Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i Base Camp along Highway 13 to L·ªôc Ninh, this did not provoke any response from the VC. From 24 October patrols were sent southwest onto the Minh Thanh Road but the VC also ignored these. From 25 to 26 October the Brigade searched the Minh Thanh Plantation without success. On 28 October patrols encountered a VC force and Col. Berry ordered the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment (1/26th Infantry) and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment (1/28th Infantry) to search the area. A platoon from the 1/26th Infantry ambushed a VC unit and Col. Berry decided to surround it by airlifting the 2/28th Infantry to the west of the scene while the 2nd Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment was landed to the south, while the 1/26th Infantry covered the north and 1/28th Infantry covered the west. With this cordon established, at 17:45 the target area was hit by over 2000 rounds of artillery fire and 70 air sorties. During the night most of the VC were able to escape to the southwest through gaps in the American lines. On 29 October BG DePuy assumed direct command of the operation and deployed his units to the southwest to search the probable escape routes, but they were unable to locate the VC. A search of the battlefield found 60 VC dead. Aftermath Operation Shenandoah officially concluded on 2 November. BG DePuy considered it a limited success as the VC 9th Division generally avoided battle. Total US casualties were 5 killed, while VC losses were claimed to be 74 killed.

TransPeshawar BRT system consists of two parts: the first encompasses an east-west corridor served by 32 stations on a dedicated lane for exclusive use by buses, while the second part consists of a network of feeder routes in which buses can enter and exit the system to travel on city streets. The system was inaugurated on August 13, 2020, and is the fourth BRT system in Pakistan. History In 2013, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa requested technical support from the Cities Development Initiative for Asia to improve Peshawar's chaotic, mismanaged, and dilapidated urban transportation network. In 2017, the CDIA completed the Urban Transport Pre-Feasibility Study that devised a 20-year urban transport plan, with a 10-year action plan. The CDIA studied two corridors, an east-west corridor, and a north-south corridor and recommended that the east-west corridor be constructed first, along Peshawar's east-west axis along the Grand Trunk Road. Construction of the project, under the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA), began in 2017, and was executed by the Peshawar Development Authority. The system was inaugurated in August 2020. Features alt= TransPeshawar's first phase consists of an east-west busway which stretches from Chamkani in the east end to the Karkhano market in the west end of Peshawar. Feeder routes will also allow buses to enter/exit the system from city streets with mixed traffic. =Route= The core system has 30 stations and is mostly elevated (around 49 %) while 38 % is at grade, and 17 % in underpasses. The line has 3.4 kilometers of underpasses, 10.5 kilometers at grade, and 13.7 kilometers elevated. The entire busway is fenced to prevent unauthorized pedestrian crossings, and to prevent vehicular traffic from entering. Stairs, elevators and bridges were built to allow pedestrians to cross the BRT corridor. =Buses= TransPeshawar was originally planned to use a fleet of 255 buses, of which 155 will be 12 meter- long buses, while 65 will be 18 meter-long articulated buses. The articulated buses will run only within the Service route/within corridor while the 12 meter-long buses will run in primarily in the Feeder system. Buses arrive every 3 minutes during peak hours, and every 5 minutes during non-peak hours.National Highway Authority The buses are low-entry, which allow easy entry and disembarkation from the doorways, especially for patrons using wheelchairs. Each bus provides free Wi-Fi services for passengers, while stations have toilet facilities. Buses are diesel-electric Plug-In Hybrids, which allow them to have improved overall fuel economy and lower emissions, and charging stations allow for recharging of batteries. All buses are environmentally friendly, and aim to reduce emissions and pollution in Peshawar. Buses are supplied by Xiamen Golden Dragon Bus Co., Ltd. The tender allowed for a variation of +/-30% in the quantity of buses, thus as a start the contract has been signed for the supply of 155 units of 12-meter buses and 65 units of 18-meter articulated buses for a total value of PKR 5.478 billion. The provision to increase the quantity of buses to a maximum of 388 buses (+30% of 299) may be done depending on passenger numbers. =Stations= TransPeshawar's 32 stations feature passing lanes at each station, allowing the function of a \\"direct service\\" system in which buses from suburban areas can access TransPeshawar's dedicated bus-lanes for use as an express service directly to the city's centre. Each station is on average 850 metres from the previous station, with an estimated travel time of 2 minutes between adjacent stations. Stations, unlike the buses themselves, are not air conditioned. =Feeder system= The TransPeshawar system in phase 2 will be complemented by a feeder system consisting of 8 routes extending 68 kilometres. Feeder buses will use dedicated BRT lanes as needed before exiting the system and entering onto city streets as on-street bus service. The feeder routes will add an additional 100 stations along those feeder lines, all of which will be new construction. Feeder station will be spaced approximately 300-500 metres from one another. Construction Construction of the east-west corridor was done in 3 phases: *Phase 1: Chamkani to Balahisar Fort *Phase 2: Balahisar Fort to Aman Chowk *Phase 3: Aman Chowk to Karkhano Market The entire road structure along the east-west corridor will also be reconstructed, and will include a new bicycle lane. The number of traffic lanes along the GT Road will also be reduced, leading to what will be intended as a more pedestrian- friendly street. Project construction was launched in November 2017, and is being built concurrent to the Peshawar Ring Road, which will redirect heavy vehicles away from the city centre. The project was awarded to consortium led by China Railway 21st Bureau Group, while engineering consulting was provided by Mott MacDonald. Fares Fares are to collected via an automated ticketing system that is also intended to be used on all city routes. On typical buses in Peshawar, fares are collected by bus operators. With implementation of the automated ticketing system, TransPeshawar bus operators will not collect fares.. The minimum cost for a ticket will be 10 Rupees whereas the highest costing ticket will be 50 Rupees. Financing The project was built with assistance from the Asian Development Bank. It was initially projected to cost , but its final estimated cost is approximately . The provincial government will borrow for the project, The system is the most expensive BRT system in Pakistan,\\"'Peshawar metro bus project costlier than Lahore, Pindi's'\\" Dawn, 19 March 2017.

Corruption Allegations and Criticism  During the Pakistan General Elections in 2018, allegations were raised against the KPK government by an engineer who resigned and claimed corruption in the project resulting in it being delayed. The General Manager (Operations) Tariq Mehmood rejected the allegations and said the assistant resident engineer was sacked from his job due to his ‚Äòpoor performance‚Äô and ‚Äòincompetence‚Äô. In March/April 2019, under the orders and directions of Chief Minister Mahmood Khan Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa conducted an inquiry on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. The provincial inspection team submitted a detailed report on the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project with an estimate that ‚Äòsome people‚Äô allegedly received kickbacks totaling around Rs. 7 billion. The team had found that the project was constructed without proper planning and showed its concerns about faulty planning and poor management. https://tribune.com.pk/story/1941421/brt-report- uncovers-rs7b-kickbacks https://www.geo.tv/latest/232984-brt-inquiry-report- highlights-faulty-planning-technical-errors-poor-management However, KP CM criticized the inspection team for making Peshawar BRT report public and stated that flaws will be fixed, but rejected allegations of traffic bottlenecks caused by the operation of BRT project.https://tribune.com.pk/story/1941421/1-brt-report-uncovers- rs7b-kickbacks/?amp=1https://tribune.com.pk/story/1947061/1-k-p-cm-criticises- pit-making-peshawar-brt-report-public/?amp=1 https://thenews.com.pk/print/462757-brt-chief-engineer-terms-provincial- inspection/?amp=1 The principal engineer of the project Gul Hameed Khalil dubbed the inquiry report as unrealistic and said: \\"that the contracts of the project were awarded under Asian development bank\\". https://nation.com.pk/26-Apr-2019/top-brt-engineer-terms-pit-s-report-half- cooked.

It was set up for the Reds captured by the White Army after the Finnish Civil War Battle of Lahti.  History  As the Battle of Lahti was over on 1 May, the German troops and the Finnish Whites captured about 30,000 Reds in the surroundings of the town. Most of them were fleeing Reds from the southwest part of Finland on their way to the east. The refugees included Red Guard fighters, their family members and other Red supporters. As the captured were guarded by only one hundred Germans and a couple of Whites, about one third of them managed to escape. Finally, approximately 22,000 Reds were gathered to the shortly-lived Fellman camp, located in the fields of the Fellman Manor on the outskirts of Lahti. Most of the women and children were soon released. The men and those suspected as female fighters were transferred to the Hennala Garrison, where the prison camp was established. As there was not enough space in Hennala, some of the captured Reds were moved to camps established in Helsinki, H√§meenlinna and Lappeenranta. In Hennala, the total number of prisoners rose up to nearly 13,000, including 2,200 women and almost 300 children under the age of 15. In the next five months, almost 1,200 prisoners died of executions, disease and malnutrition. Hennala camp was active until 15 September 1918, when most of the prisoners were released on parole. The camp was turned into a forced labour camp for convicted Reds, which was finally closed on 1 October 1919.  Executions  Executed women in Hennala The number of Reds executed in Hennala was about 500, at least 218 of them were women, the youngest being only 14-year-old girls. A total of 13 underaged children were shot. The largest single execution in Lahti was made on 9 May, when at least 100 Red women were shot. All those executed women did not belong to the armed guards, the victims included women who had only joined the fleeing refugees. Among them were pregnant women and mothers of small children. According to the diaries of the German officer Hans Tr√∂bst, the women were shot with a machine gun in the nearby wood. They were most likely raped before the execution. The executions were carried out by the battalion of the notorious Estonian colonel Hans Kalm who was interested in eugenics. For him, the Red women represented the lowest category of society. One of the executed male fighters was the Red Guard commander-in-chief Ali Aaltonen who was shot by Kalm himself.  Memorials  The killed Reds were buried into a mass grave in the Mustankallio Cemetery. The first memorial was erected secretly in the night before the First of May in 1929. The monument was soon vandalized and destroyed by the Whites. The present memorial was finally erected after the World War II in 1946, as the political situation in Finland had changed. Another monument was unveiled in Hennala in 1949. The third memorial is placed in the area of the Fellman camp, which today is a park in the western side of the Lahti city center. The monument is a work of the sculptor Erkki Kannosto and it was erected in 1978.  Importance  In the post-war decades, the Hennala camp has become the best known and most remembered prison camp together with the Tammisaari camp. Hennala has been described in several pieces of literature, plays, films and music. Even the Finnish painter Henry Ericsson, who served in Hennala as a guard, has described the languished prisoners in his etchings.

The $32 million, 272-unit building opened in 2001, but was closed in 2010 after the discovery of major structural flaws and corrosion that forced evacuation and demolition. The building was demolished in 2011 using heavy machinery and filled with dirt. The site was re-excavated in 2017 for a new residential building that opened in 2019. History The McGuire Apartments opened in April 2001 at a cost of $32 million, a joint venture by the Carpenters Union Local 131 and Harbor Properties. The 272-unit tower was built by McCarthy Building Companies as part of a wave of condominium and apartment development in the Belltown neighborhood during the late 1990s. The building also had a five-story, above- ground parking garage topped by a private park. As early as 2004, issues with the building's exterior and water-proofing were discovered and reported to the municipal planning department. By 2010, the building was clad in scaffolding during repairs by the owners to the cracked exterior. During inspection of the building's frame in 2008, the building's owners discovered corrosion of cables and load-bearing cable ends in the post-tensioned concrete floors of the building, due to inadequate painting and the use of an improper type of grout that failed to keep water out. Repairs were estimated at $23 million in 2008, but this climbed to over $80 million by early 2010, forcing the building's owners to announce plans in April to demolish the nine-year-old building. The announcement forced 244 residents and several businesses to vacate the building by the end of 2010. A floor-by-floor demolition of the McGuire Apartments building, as opposed to the implosion method used for Seattle's Kingdome in 2000, was approved by the City of Seattle in March 2011. Contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis began salvage and demolition work on April 4, 2011, with the garage leveled beginning the following month. The demolition was completed in early 2012, and claimed the life of a construction worker during work on the 22nd floor in September 2011. City-hired inspectors were initially found to be negligent in failing to report the problems during construction and later inspections, and the incident led to reforms in the standards for post-tensioned concrete construction in building codes. =Planned replacement= After the completion of demolition work in 2012, reverting the building site into a surface parking lot, advisers to the pension firm that owns the site recommended building a new apartment building. A food truck stand and farmers' market were among ideas for temporary use of the site, but were rejected in favor of building as soon as possible. In June 2015, national developer AvalonBay Communities filed permits to explore a 24-story, 320-unit building on the site. AvalonBay bought the property for $24 million in April 2016 and hired architectural firm Ankrom Moisan to design the new building. A revised design was unveiled in September 2016, featuring 283 units arranged in three setback sections (ranging from 7 to 24 stories in height), allowing for the addition of rooftop sections. Construction on the new $147 million building began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, opening at the Avalon Belltown Towers. A 50-room part of the building was furnished into a small hotel operated by WhyHotel.

In 2011, Lansdorp sold a majority of his Ampyx Power shares to fund his new project, Mars One. Wubbo Ockels' interest in energy began when he let a kite line slip and it burned his hand. He became interested and started to study and research how this could be turned into electricity. At Delft University, he formed a team with Bas Lansdorp that worked on developing kites that could retrieve energy from the sky. Richard Ruiterkamp became the team leader and he created a fixed wing aircraft that allowed greater controllability and allowing the generation of more energy. In 2008 he founded the company with Bas Lansdorp. Lansdorp worked on the business aspect, and Ruiterkamp was head of the science division. Currently, Ampyx Power has a team of 40 engineers. The current prototype is the AP3 Ampyx Power Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES). The system is a tethered aircraft that converts wind into electric energy. The aircraft is tethered to an on the ground generator. When the aircraft moves and flies, it reels the tether and powers the generator. The plane is then reeled in through the tether and then re-released into the air.  History  = Founding = Originally, the company was a team that former astronaut Wubbo Ockels formed at Delft University of Technology to investigate how heat, wind, and friction energy could be converted into electricity. The team consisted of several scientists, including team leader Richard Ruiterkamp and Wubbo Ockels. Bas Lansdorp later stepped in as a business manager. In 2008 Ampyx Power was founded by Bas Lansdorp and Richard Ruiterkamp. The company's original prototypes were tethered flexible membrane kites but then Ruiterkamp began to work on fixed wing aircraft. The company now consists of 50 employees of which 40 are engineers. = AP0-AP3 Prototypes = Ampyx Power proved its concept with three generations of prototypes (AP0 ‚Äì AP2) constructed between 2009 and 2013. = 2009 - 2012: AP0 Prototypes = Ampyx Power showed that power production with a tethered aircraft is feasible with the first prototype, AP0. = 2012: AP1 Prototype - First Autonomous 1 Hour Flight = Ampyx Power reached a significant milestone in 2012 by showing fully autonomous power production for the first time. During a 50 minute flight, the possibility of autonomous operation was demonstrated. Many investors, such as EON, noticed the company at this point and started to take interest in Ampyx Power's take on wind power. = 2015: AP3 Design Started = Ampyx Power started the design of the last prototype AP3. The goal of AP3 was to prove scaling and robust continuous operation. Upon completion of AP3, the technology matured to a state that the commercial type can be defined. In December 2016 Orange Aircraft in Breda started the production of AP3. The company had also commissioned an assessment of the ecological impact of the technology. The technology was used as an example for a life cycle assessment of airborne wind energy. = April 2017: Ampyx Power and EON cooperation = On April 17, 2017, Ampyx Power signed a cooperation agreement with German energy company EON. Under the contract, EON and Ampyx Power collaborated to realise an AP3 and AP4 test site in Ireland. Following successful demonstration of AP3 and AP4 the companies continued with the first offshore test site and the subsequent re-powering of early EON offshore projects to prolong the technical lifetime. = April 2018: Sea Air Farm research - Demonstrating the potential of far offshore floating wind farms = The cost of offshore wind power increases significantly with water depth, due to the increased costs of foundation works either bottom-fixed or floating. Due to its much smaller overturning moments, Ampyx Power‚Äôs system, which generates electricity from wind using an aircraft flying 500m high, could be deployed on relatively small anchored floating platforms, allowing economically possible deployment of AWES in places where deployment of conventional offshore wind turbines is economically or technically impossible. The project, called the ‚ÄòSea-Air-Farm‚Äô project, was performed by a consortium of Ampyx Power, ECN (Energy Research Centre Netherlands), Marin (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) and Mocean Offshore. The consortium researched the offshore application of floating AWES and the possibilities and limitations of an entire airborne wind park with multiple systems, far- offshore and in deep waters. The project was carried out with subsidy of Topsector Energy from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. ECN validated the aerodynamic tools, modelled installation and O&M; scenarios, and calculated the yield and costs. Mocean Offshore designed the floating platform with its mooring and infield cables, which were tested in Marin‚Äôs test basin. Ampyx Power designed the conceptual aircraft and the entire offshore windfarm, studied the certification framework, and managed the project. The research indicates that a wind farm is technically possible and cost competitive. The figures are promising for the future of AWES, given the fact that MW-scale AWES are still at the very early stages of their technological and commercial development, and significant further cost reductions can be expected in the future. A public summary was published in April 2018.

The Manchega is most famous for producing the milk that is used to produce Manchego cheese, a very popular Spanish sheep's milk cheese. Origins Manchega sheep are native to the La Mancha plateau in New Castile. The Manchega sheep's ancestors were known as Ovis aries ligeries, and migrated across the Pyrenees and much of northern Spain before finally settling in La Mancha. The breed was domesticated by the early residents of La Mancha and bred to its current state. The Manchega were typically only bred among themselves and were seldom crossbred, resulting in a remarkably pure bloodline among today's animals. As a result, the Manchega's characteristics have remained relatively unchanged over the past several centuries. Characteristics The Manchega is a medium-sized, entrefino type sheep. The Manchega come in two colors, white and black, although the white Manchega comprises the vast majority of the animals, with roughly 90% of Manchega possessing this coloration. Both sexes of Manchega are polled. The sheep is of a medium weight and height, with rams typically weighing 85-90 kilograms and standing 76 centimeters tall, and ewes weighing 55-60 kilograms and standing 68 centimeters tall. The Manchega's wool has a staple length of about 14-16 centimeters and a fiber diameter of 26-8 microns. They are a medium wool breed. There are also three different sub types of Manchega: the alcarre√±a (also known as manchega peque√±a), the montesina and the black manchega. Use and raising The most famous product from Manchega sheep is the Manchego cheese made from their milk. True Manchego cheese must be made from the whole milk of Manchega sheep raised in La Mancha. In La Mancha, Manchego are primarily raised for dairy production, but elsewhere their use is more diversified and they may be raised for meat as well. The Manchega has an annual milk production of about 100 liters (26.2 gallons) a year, with production greatly increasing in the months of April, May, and June, and consequently decreasing the rest of the year. The milking is often done by hand. In La Mancha, Manchega are typically raised in flocks of 100-600, although herds of up to 2,000 sheep have been known to exist. Typically they are able to graze year-round on the grassy plains of La Mancha, although they may be fed supplementary feeds, especially during lactation or pregnancy. Their feed is often also supplemented in the fall and winter with tendrils from vines and stubble from cropland. The Manchega's genetics have also played a role in the development of two other breeds: the segure√±a and talaverana.

The building was one of the first theatres in the region, and was originally a vaudeville/opera house/live performance venue. Built in 1893, it was designed by architect Oscar Cobb. It is located in a spot that was originally surrounded by hotels. The massive two-story brick building was built in the Romanesque Revival Style. The auditorium is located on the second floor, which features graceful arched windows on the front side. The street level contains two storefront spaces with square window designs. According to the 1893 Ashland Daily Press Annual Edition, the original plan and location for this building were different. Proposed at a corner of Sixth Avenue West and Main Street West, it was built instead at the present location with a smaller and less expensive design. This was likely due to the financial panic of 1893. With Vacant and in need of restoration, the opera house received some redevelopment, including the restoration of the front facade. The building is a contributing resource within the West Second Street Historic District, of downtown Ashland. With Although not located directly on Second Street (later renamed Main Street), it is still considered a contribution to the Historic District, being located close to the District on a side street. In later years, the building housed a liquor store and a gun shop.

In his memoir, filmmaker Karl Brown described Kingsley's reporting style: > She would not touch scandal in any way, no matter how juicy it might be. She > reported picture doings only, not bedroom escapades, brawls, separations, or > desertions. Her idea of picture news was to tell who was doing what, where, > when, and for how long.

He was Mayor of Brisbane in 1906.  Personal life  Crase was born in 1837 in St Ives, Cornwall, and emigrated to Queensland, arriving in 1859. He had at least two daughters, Annie Eileen, who did not survive infancy and who died in 1891, and Elisabeth, who was married in 1889.  John Crase & Co.  Crase was in partnership with James H Phipps, the business being known as John Crase & Co. It was located in Warren Street, Valley.  Political career  Crase first came to public attention as an outspoken opponent of federation in Queensland. A report in the Brisbane Courier from April 1899 accused Crase of \\"(seizing) the opportunity of making an effort to keep Queensland outside the federation,\\" before concluding that \\"there need be no reason to fear the fate of the bill with such opponents as (Mr.) Crase\\". He was first elected to the Brisbane City Council as an alderman for the Northern Ward in 1904. Party allegiances at the time were not strong in local politics, and for the most part aldermen were elected as non-partisan representatives. There is some evidence, however, that Crase had sympathies in line with those of the Protectionist Party, adopting as his motto \\"Australian Goods for Australian Men\\", and having chaired meetings for the Queensland branch of the Australian National Protectionist Union where Protectionist candidates were endorsed for election to Federal Parliament. Nonetheless, he opposed the introduction of party politics into municipal government, believing it to be unnecessary and counterproductive. Crase was, during his time in office, widely considered to be an export on local government finance matters, and argued for numerous financial reforms in the way that government was run. In particular, he argued that it was \\"oppressive and unfair\\" for ratepayers to bear the complete cost of municipal government, given that non-property owners also benefited from municipal works, and opposed the expenditure of public money on public utilities wherever possible, referring to them as \\"experimental enterprises\\", and arguing that council had no reason to be competing with private businesses run by ratepayers. Nonetheless, he conceded that certain services could only be run effectively by the council (citing the provision of drinking water as an example), and argued that in these cases the public interest would best be served by council developing its own service delivery capacity, rather than relying on \\"lowest tenderer\\" contract labour. In 1906, Crase was elected by his fellow aldermen as mayor of Brisbane. The position of Mayor at this time was not a popularly elected position, instead being selected by the aldermen from amongst its number. It was common for the position to rotate regularly amongst the aldermen during this period. Nonetheless, Crase was referred to as \\"well-regarded\\" by the Brisbane Courier upon his election, and he was elected unopposed to his alderman's seat in the same year. Following his term as Mayor, Crase remained active in local government politics. He released a pamphlet entitled \\"Municipal Government\\" in 1908 that served as a political manifesto for his views on local government. He also vigorously advocated the \\"Greater Brisbane\\" doctrine, for the consolidation of the smaller municipal councils in the Brisbane region into a single, larger local government body. Crase would not live to see this happen though, dying in office in 1919.  Death  Crase died on 1 June 1919.

On 21 March 2017, the rebel offensive code-named the \\"Battle of Tell Them to Work\\" was launched when two Tahrir al-Sham suicide bombers detonated two large car bombs against government positions in the town of Suran. Rebel forces led by Tahrir al-Sham then proceeded to attack Suran and the nearby villages of Maardis and Ma'an. The rebels captured the three villages by 22 March, but this was denied by Hezbollah.

Reuters. 22 March 2017 The rebels aimed to capture Jabal Zayn al-Abidin and attack the Hama Military Airport, and reportedly advanced to within 7 kilometers of Hama city. On 23 March, rebels captured the villages of Kawkab and Iskandariyah, stormed Maardis, and cut off the road linking Mahardah to Hama. The advances that day brought HTS-led forces within 5 kilometers of Hama city. Pro-government al-Masdar News claimed that the rebels carried out a massacre of Alawites in the village of al-Majdal, killing up to 30 of them. According to an opposition source, Sham FM radio reported that this was denied by Mohaled Hazzouri, the governor of Hama. Later that day, the Syrian Army recaptured Kawkab. Al-Masdar News also reported that Khattab and one other village were recaptured amid an ongoing counter-offensive. =Syrian Army repels Ahrar al-Sham-led offensive on Kernaz= On 24 March, six rebel factions led by Ahrar al-Sham launched a separate offensive, code-named the \\"Echo of the Levant\\", on the northwestern front of Hama, with the goal to surround and capture Karnaz. However, after managing to initially capture three villages, the rebels were forced to retreat due to heavy artillery shelling. =Rebel attack on Qomhana and Syrian Army advance near Mahardah= Army of Glory fighter launches a BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile at government positions during the offensive. On 24 March, the rebels attacked the town of Qomhana, north of Hama. Following an attack by three suicide car-bombers, the rebels managed to penetrate the town's defenses and heavy fighting ensued inside it. However, the rebel attack was eventually repelled after the Army encircled the rebels inside Qomhana and cleared them out.

They claimed to had killed over 150 soldiers; however, sources on the ground gave a count of between 14 and 20 casualties. Elsewhere, the rebels started a new attack on Qomhana, which also involved a suicide bombing. Kawkab was once again captured by the rebels for several hours, before the Army retook it once again, as well as Tall al Abadi hill south of Maardes. On 26 March, after a new morning rebel attack was repelled on Qomhana's western flank, the HTS rebels withdrew their forces to the cemetery area outside the town. The Syrian Army then attacked the cemetery area, overrunning HTS positions that afternoon. Subsequently, the Army captured the nearby hilltop of Tal Al-Sammam and its three checkpoints. They then started preparing to enter Khitab, which was reportedly empty but still not safe due to the large presence of rebels around the village. In the evening, HTS-led forces launched another three-hour rebel assault on Qomhana. Despite the rebels initially managing to penetrate the Syrian Army's first defense line on the town's northern flank, Army reinforcements from the east and the west reportedly managed to besiege the rebel forces in Qomhana's north, killing a large number of them, and forcing the rest to retreat. On 27 March, the Army recaptured a village south of Mahardah.ŸÇÿµŸÅ ÿ¨ŸàŸä ŸÖÿ™ÿµÿßÿπÿØ Ÿäÿ±ÿßŸÅŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ®ÿßŸÉÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ŸàÿßÿµŸÑÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸàÿ± ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÅ ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿ© The military also reportedly seized the Mahardah bridge, reaching the outskirts of the village of Arzeh. =Second Ahrar al-Sham-led attack repelled= On 28 March, the rebels launched a new assault on two flanks north of Mahardah, capturing the Al-Qaramitah area. They also seized Tall Al-Sakhr hill, Al-Sakhir village and the nearby grain silos near Kernaz. However, the attack was eventually repelled later in the day, as the Syrian Army regained all the lost positions at Al-Qaramitah and Sakhir. Three Syrian Army tanks were destroyed or damaged by BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles during the day's fighting. =Syrian Army counterattack and rebels pushed back= On 29 March, HTS-led forces captured Tal Shihah hill, south of Khitab, bringing HTS-led jihadists within 3 kilometers of Hama city. Concurrently, the Army counter-attacked north of Qomhana and recaptured several positions, including Saman hill. Later in the day, the military also recaptured Tal Shihah. Subsequently, the Syrian army captured the strategic hilltop of Tal Bizam, north of Suran. The next day, the Syrian Army captured six locations, including the town of Arzah and Point 50, to the south west of Qomhana and south of Khitab. Meanwhile, another rebel attack on the northwestern front was repelled. On 30 March, a government airstrike hit al- Lataminah. More than 70 people in the area were then exposed to an unidentified chemical agent and showed symptoms of nausea, agitation, foaming, muscle spasm, and miosis (constriction of the pupil of the eye); cardiac arrest occurred in two of the victims and an orthopedic doctor died. On 31 March, the Syrian army recaptured Khitab and five other villages along with several hills and checkpoints. They also reopened the Hama-Mhardheh highway and pushed back the rebels to positions 11 kilometers from Hama Military Airport. =Back-and-forth fighting and the Syrian Army reaches Suran= On 3 April, the Syrian Army recaptured the town of Maardis, along with the nearby silos and hills. Subsequently, they shifted their assault and reclaimed the village of Iskanderiyah and Maardis bridge. A government aircraft was reported to carry out a chlorine gas attack on Al-Habit, injuring dozens and killing two children. The next day, the rebels counter-attacked against Maardis and recaptured it after more than nine hours of heavy fighting. The initial rebel assault involved three suicide car-bombers, according to pro-government sources. The town of Khan Shaykoun was reported to have been struck by an airstrike by government forces followed by massive civilian chemical poisoning. The release of a toxic gas, which included sarin, or a similar substance, killed at least 89 people and injured more than 541, according to the opposition Idlib Health Directorate.http://syriacivildefense.org/press- release/joint-statement-syria-civil-defence-and-health-directorate-idlib The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war since the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013. On 5 April, Maardis was once again contested, although by the afternoon the rebels managed to push back government forces and retain control of the town. Subsequently, a rebel suicide car-bomber attacked the government-held hill of Tall Abadah, 1,500 meters southeast of Maardis, reportedly immobilizing a tank. At the same time, the Army captured a checkpoint near Halfaya and managed to penetrate the town from the west. However, the rebels regained the lost ground at Halfaya later in the day, while also recapturing Iskandariyah. On 7 April, around noon, the rebels advanced and captured several positions south of Maardis. However, this turned out to be a trap set up by the Army with dozens of rebel reported killed. After several hours of clashes, the military recaptured the positions they had lost, in addition to Iskandariyah which they attacked from two flanks. Three days later, government troops recaptured Maardis as well. Fighting continued on 11 April, as the Army seized the ‚ÄúRussian Regiment‚Äù base, south of Suran. =All rebel gains reversed= On 14 April, the military launched an attack toward Halfaya, capturing several checkpoints south of the town. At the same time, the Army shelled rebel positions around Suran and Taybat al-Imam. However, despite these initial advances, the Army was eventually pushed back from Halfaya after suffering heavy casualties. Two tanks were also captured by the rebels. On 16 April, following over 40 air- strikes against rebel supply lines the previous night, the Syrian Army recaptured Suran after 10 hours of intense fighting, thus reversing all rebel gains during the offensive. Several hours later, the rebels fired more than 40 Grad rockets towards Hama Military Airport, destroying a MIG-23 fighter jet and several large ammo depots. =Army push into rebel territory; Taybat al- Imam and Halfaya captured= On 17 April, the military launched an attack on Taybat al-Imam and reportedly captured a checkpoint at the eastern entrance to the town. On 20 April, heavy fighting erupted in the areas of Taybat al-Imam and Halfaya, as government forces tried to capture both towns. Over the previous 48 hours, more than 400 air-strikes were conducted in the northern Hama countryside. Eventually, government troops managed to capture Taybat al- Imam and pushed further west towards Halfaya, taking a checkpoint. Subsequently, the rebels launched a counter-attack and managed to recapture large parts of Taybat al-Imam.ÿßŸÑŸÅÿµÿßÿ¶ŸÑ ÿ™ÿπÿßŸàÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿ∑Ÿäÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ŸàÿÆÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ÿ± ÿ®ÿ¥ÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÇÿ™ÿ≠ÿßŸÖ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿ®ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿ© However, after intense clashes that lasted several hours during the night, the military managed to push back the rebels and retain control of the town. On 22 April, the Army expanded the buffer zone around Taybat al-Imam with new advances. The next morning, the Syrian Army captured Halfaya and began operations to capture Morek. These advances left government forces once again in control of all areas they had lost during the rebel's previous offensive in late 2016. On 24 April, the Army continued its advance north towards Al-Lataminah and Morek. In the process, the SAA captured two or four more villages and a checkpoint, thus reaching the outskirts of Lataminah. The next day, the rebels partially recaptured Al-Massasnah in a counter-attack, before the Syrian Army regained their positions in the town the following morning, while also capturing the village of Zullaqiat, north of Halfaya. On 28 April, rebel forces again assaulted Al-Massasnah, but their attack was eventually repelled.  Aftermath  On 19 September 2017, Tahrir al-Sham, the Turkistan Islamic Party, and their allies launched a new offensive in northern Hama under the codename \\"Oh Servants of God, Be Steadfast\\". The rebels initially captured four villages, but after back-and- forth fighting during which the villages changed hands several times, government forces recaptured all of the villages by 22 September. 66 rebels and 38 soldiers were killed during the offensive, while more than 40 civilians were killed in nearly 500 air-strikes on about 40 towns and villages in retaliation for the rebel offensive.

Career  Beginning in 1972, she taught cultural anthropology at the Graduate Faculty of The New School for Social Research in New York, before accepting a professorship at the City University of New York. She was the editor of the international journal American Ethnologist (1984-1989), and later served as Book Review Editor for Anthropology Now (2010-2013). Professor Lindenbaum is currently living in New York and is emerita professor of the Graduate Division of the City University of New York.  Research on kuru  Lindenbaum began her investigative work on the cause of kuru in 1961. With her colleague and then- husband Robert Glasse, she did two years of fieldwork in the highlands of Papua New Guinea using a research grant from Henry Bennett of the Rockefeller Foundation. Bennett believed that kuru had a genetic origin, so he suggested that Lindenbaum and Glasse study Fore kinship. The two studied kinship in addition to oral histories, beliefs, and practices, while taking epidemiological notes on the disease itself.Lindenbaum S. Understanding kuru: the contribution of anthropology and medicine. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. 2008;363(1510):3715-3720. doi:10.1098/rstb.2008.0072. Lindenbaum and Glasse discovered that Fore kinship was not based strictly on biology, but rather it was determined by bonding with neighboring individuals. As a result, families were not described as traditional nuclear families: \\"Instead of depth, the Fore relied on lateral expansions of relatedness.\\" This finding was notable because kuru was not strongly correlated with biological relationships, but rather kin in this more extended sense. During this time, Lindenbaum and Glasse also discovered that the Fore people partook in a ritual called mortuary cannibalism, where kin honored the dead by feasting on their cooked bodies. People avoided eating kin who died of dysentery and leprosy, but did not shy away from eating people who died of kuru. Through oral histories, it was determined that the kuru epidemic had begun among the northernmost Fore at the turn of the century, some time in the 1890s. It is now presumed that a spontaneous case of Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (like kuru, a prion-related disorder) occurred at that time. When that person died and was consumed by kin, the kuru epidemic spread further south. Lindenbaum and Glasse noted also that the geographic spread of kuru closely matched the practice of mortuary cannibalism throughout this region, providing substantial evidence that cannibalism was the mode of transmission. Moreover, the research team noted that women and children were primarily impacted by kuru, which correlated with mortuary cannibalism practices. Men were less likely than women to partake in mortuary cannibalism, and when they did, they were less likely to eat women. As a result, men were less likely to get kuru compared to women and children. Professor Lindenbaum's work was originally resisted by genetic and biomedical researchers who insisted that the disease was likely genetic and non-infectious. This research contributed substantially to our current understanding of the nature and transmission of kuru. Since this research, Lindenbaum has written several reflections, articles, and books about kuru and the Fore people. Most importantly, her work led to the discovery of prion communicable diseases of which kuru was found to be one. Professor Lindenbaum was honoree for the year 2017 of the Journal of 'Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry', AD Gaines, Editor-in-Chief (q.v.) An essay on her career appears in the December 2017 (41(4)) issue of that journal.

Political career Agnihotri first became a sarpanch (head of a village) of Sheron (where his hospital is) and he was unanimously elected in 1997. Agnihotri was recruited by Amarinder Singh in 2007 to run as a candidate for the legislative assembly from Naushara Panwan, but lost by a slim margin of 2459 votes against Ranjit Singh Brahampura. In 2012 Dharambir switched constituencies and this time fought the election from the Taran Tarn constituency, again he lost this time by a narrow margin of 4621 votes to Harmeet Singh Sandhu. In 2010 he was made District President of Taran Tarn and he resigned in 2013. In 2014 he was made the general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. In 2017, Agnihotri again ran from Taran Tarn and this time he defeated the incumbent Harmeet Singh Sandhu by a margin of 14,629 votes. This was seen as a very historical win because it was the first time that a candidate from the Congress party won from this constituency in around 40 years. Along with this Dharambir was the first Hindu candidate to ever win an election from this constituency.

Its title is a tribute to Constantine P. Cavafy. Filmed during the Regime of the Colonels, the film draws parallels between the regime and the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, but it does so implicitly, in order to escape censorship. Angelopoulos elsewhere speaks of an \\"aesthetic of the unspoken.\\" He points out that the most important things always happen out of the field of view, behind closed doors or on the phone. When something is said, it is only whispered. Synopsis In May 1936, in a Greece riven by political strife, a trade union leader is assassinated. Sofianos, a petty criminal and smuggler as well as a police informant and leftist agitator, is accused of the murder. Kept incommunicado in a room separate from the other detainees, his only two visitors are a member of parliament from the Conservative Party and his driver, who is also his brother. One day, Sofianos takes the member of parliament as a hostage inside his cell to obtain his release before midnight; it is not clear how he has obtained the revolver which he was using. The prison guards are powerless, while the warden is under pressure from his political bosses to find a quick resolution to the standoff. Sofianos's lawyer tries to reason with him, explaining to his client that the weapon in his possession is a trap that has been set up for him, and that by taking the deputy as a hostage he is playing the game of those who accuse him. The lawyer conducts an investigation to exonerate Sofianos but ends up being beaten up in a deserted street. In the meantime, an escape attempt takes place in the prison, but three escapees are caught up in the countryside. Under pressure from representatives of the major powers, the political and prison authorities are trying to put an end to the hostage-taking by various means, including the poisoning of the prisoner. Eventually, at nightfall, a sniper shoots Sofianos in his cell. The next morning, the three escapees are shot and the body of Sofianos is added to the funeral truck.

He is the founder and chairman of Iceland Ocean Cluster. He is also the co-founder of Codland, Hlemmur Food Hall and Grandi Food Hall. He has written eight books on topics of international business, knowledge networks and salmon.  Early life and education  Sigfusson was born in the Vestman Islands archipelago just off the south coast of Iceland. He completed his BA degree from University of North Carolina in 1991.  Career  After completing his MS degree in Economics in 1993, he became a special advisor to the Minister of Finance of Iceland in January 1994. After working there for four years, he left the ministry to join the Nordic Investment Bank as deputy managing director. In January 2003, he left Nordic Investment bank and joined Iceland Chamber of Commerce as Managing Director. In 2005, Sigfusson joined Sjova Insurance as Managing Director of the company. He left Sjova Insurance in 2009, after technically bankrupting that company by spending the claims fund on stocks, and joined University of Iceland for PhD in Business. In his studies he focused on how entrepreneurs used networks in their internationalisation. His studies indicated companies and entrepreneurs in the marine industry were not well connected with each other. He began working on a network to increase interaction between marine tech companies and launched the Iceland Ocean Cluster in 2011. The cluster focuses on developing innovative ideas in the fishing industry. In May 2012, Sigfusson founded the Ocean Cluster House. Since establishing the Iceland Ocean Cluster, Sigfusson has spent his time speaking to audience in US and Europe about the opportunities in building networks in the marine industry. In 2015, Sigfusson co-founded a sister cluster to the IOC, the New England Ocean Cluster to drive new ideas in the marine industry. Using the research and information generated from Iceland Ocean Cluster, Sigfusson founded Codland in September 2012. Codland emerged as the merger of a biotechnology company and fishing companies with plans to fully utilize byproducts from the North Atlantic Cod. The cluster also initiated the North Atlantic Marine Cluster Project, which works to increase relations between ocean and marine industries in the North Atlantic. In 2013, he founded the company Collagen with the aim to use fish skin to create marine collagen. In 2016 he co-founded Hlemmur Food Hall, Sj√≥-Food Hall and Reykjavik Foods.

The kingdom of Macedonia was an ancient state in what is now the Macedonian region of northern Greece, founded in the mid-7th century BC during the period of Archaic Greece and lasting until the mid-2nd century BC. Led first by the Argead dynasty of kings, Macedonia became a vassal state of the Achaemenid Empire of ancient Persia during the reigns of Amyntas I of Macedon () and his son Alexander I of Macedon (). The period of Achaemenid Macedonia came to an end in roughly 479 BC with the ultimate Greek victory against the second Persian invasion of Greece led by Xerxes I and the withdrawal of Persian forces from the European mainland. During the age of Classical Greece, Perdiccas II of Macedon () became directly involved in the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC) between Classical Athens and Sparta, shifting his alliance from one city-state to another while attempting to retain Macedonian control over the Chalcidice peninsula. His reign was also marked by conflict and temporary alliances with the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian Kingdom. He eventually made peace with Athens, which formed an alliance with Macedonia that carried over into the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon (). His reign brought peace, stability, and financial security to the Macedonian realm, yet his little-understood assassination (perhaps by a royal page) left the kingdom in peril and conflict. The turbulent reign of Amyntas III of Macedon () witnessed devastating invasions by both the Illyrian ruler Bardylis of the Dardani and the Chalcidian city-state of Olynthos, both of which were defeated with the aid of foreign powers, the city-states of Thessaly and Sparta, respectively. Alexander II () invaded Thessaly but failed to hold Larissa, which was captured by Pelopidas of Thebes, who made peace with Macedonia on condition that they surrender noble hostages, including the future king Philip II of Macedon (). Philip II came to power when his older brother Perdiccas III of Macedon () was defeated and killed in battle by the forces of Bardylis. With the use of skillful diplomacy, Philip II was able to make peace with the Illyrians, Thracians, Paeonians, and Athenians who threatened his borders. This allowed him time to dramatically reform the Ancient Macedonian army, establishing the Macedonian phalanx that would prove crucial to his kingdom's success in subduing Greece, with the exception of Sparta. He gradually enhanced his political power by forming marriage alliances with foreign powers, destroying the Chalcidian League in the Olynthian War (349‚Äì348 BC), and becoming an elected member of the Thessalian and Amphictyonic Leagues for his role in defeating Phocis in the Third Sacred War (356‚Äì346 BC). After the Macedonian victory over a coalition led by Athens and Thebes at the 338 BC Battle of Chaeronea, Philip established the League of Corinth and was elected as its hegemon in anticipation of commanding a united Greek invasion of the Achaemenid Empire under Macedonian hegemony. However, when Philip II was assassinated by one of his bodyguards, he was succeeded by his son Alexander III, better known as Alexander the Great (), who invaded Achaemenid Egypt and Asia and toppled the rule of Darius III, who was forced to flee into Bactria (in what is now Afghanistan) where he was killed by one of his kinsmen, Bessus. This pretender to the throne was eventually executed by Alexander, yet the latter eventually succumbed to an unknown illness at the age of 32, whose death led to the Partition of Babylon by his former generals, the diadochi, chief among them being Antipater, regent of Alexander IV of Macedon (). This event ushered in the Hellenistic period in West Asia and the Mediterranean world, leading to the formation of the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, and Attalid successor kingdoms in the former territories of Alexander's empire. Macedonia continued its role as the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece, yet its authority became diminished due to civil wars between the Antipatrid and nascent Antigonid dynasty. After surviving crippling invasions by Pyrrhus of Epirus, Lysimachus, Seleucus I Nicator, and the Celtic Galatians, Macedonia under the leadership of Antigonus II of Macedon () was able to subdue Athens and defend against the naval onslaught of Ptolemaic Egypt in the Chremonidean War (267‚Äì261 BC). However, the rebellion of Aratus of Sicyon in 351 BC led to the formation of the Achaean League, which proved to be a perennial problem for the ambitions of the Macedonian kings in mainland Greece. Macedonian power saw a resurgence under Antigonus III Doson (), who defeated the Spartans under Cleomenes III in the Cleomenean War (229‚Äì222 BC). Although Philip V of Macedon () managed to defeat the Aetolian League in the Social War (220‚Äì217 BC), his attempts to project Macedonian power into the Adriatic Sea and formation of a Macedonian‚ÄìCarthaginian Treaty with Hannibal alarmed the Roman Republic, which convinced a coalition of Greek city-states to attack Macedonia while Rome focused on defeating Hannibal in Italy. Rome was ultimately victorious in the First (214‚Äì205 BC) and Second Macedonian War (200‚Äì197 BC) against Philip V, who was also defeated in the Cretan War (205‚Äì200 BC) by a coalition led by Rhodes. Macedonia was forced to relinquish its holdings in Greece outside of Macedonia proper, while the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC) succeeded in toppling the monarchy altogether, after which Rome placed Perseus of Macedon () under house arrest and established four client state republics in Macedonia. In an attempt to dissuade rebellion in Macedonia, Rome imposed stringent constitutions in these states that limited their economic growth and interactivity. However, Andriscus, a pretender to the throne claiming descent from the Antigonids, briefly revived the Macedonian monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War (150‚Äì148 BC). His forces were crushed at the second Battle of Pydna by the Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, leading to the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia and the initial period of Roman Greece. Early history and legend The entrance to one of the royal tombs at Vergina, a UNESCO World Heritage site The Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides reported the legend that the Macedonian kings of the Argead dynasty were descendants of Temenus of Argos, Peloponnese, who was believed to have had the mythical Heracles as one of his ancestors.; ; . The legend states that three brothers and descendants of Temenus wandered from Illyria to Upper Macedonia, where a local king nearly had them killed and forced into exile due to an omen that the youngest, Perdiccas, would become king. The latter eventually obtained the title after settling near the alleged gardens of Midas next to Mount Bermius in Lower Macedonia. Other legends, mentioned by the Roman historians Livy, Velleius and Justin and by the Greek biographer Plutarch and the Greek geographer Pausanias stated that Caranus of Macedon was the first Macedonian king and that he was succeeded by Perdiccas I.Titus Livius, \\"The History of Rome\\", 45.9: \\"This was the end of the war between the Romans and Perseus, after four years of steady campaigning, and also the end of a kingdom famed over a large part of Europe and all of Asia. They reckoned Perseus as the twentieth after Caranus, who founded the kingdom.\\"Marcus Velleius Paterculus, \\"History of Rome\\", 1.6: \\"In this period, sixty-five years before the founding of Rome, Carthage was established by the Tyrian Elissa, by some authors called Dido. About this time also Caranus, a man of royal race, eleventh in descent from Hercules, set out from Argos and seized the kingship of Macedonia. From him Alexander the Great was descended in the seventeenth generation, and could boast that, on his mother's side, he was descended from Achilles, and, on his father's side, from Hercules.‚ÄùJustin, \\"Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus\\", 7.1.7: \\"But Caranus accompanied by a great multitude of Greeks, having been directed by an oracle to seek a settlement in Macedonia, and having come into Emathia, and followed a flock of goats that were fleeing from a tempest, possessed himself of the city of Edessa...‚ÄùPlutarch, ‚ÄúAlexander‚Äù, 2.1: \\"As for the lineage of Alexander, on his father's side he was a descendant of Heracles through Caranus, and on his mother's side a descendant of Aeacus through Neoptolemus; this is accepted without any question.\\"Pausanias, \\"Description of Greece\\", 9.40.8-9: \\"The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of Macedonia, overcame in battle Cisseus, a chieftain in a bordering country. For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion, but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus, which then vanished. Caranus, they assert, realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so, they say, the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia, neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies, neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India.\\". Greeks of the Classical period generally accepted the origin story provided by Herodotus, or another involving lineage from Zeus, chief god of the Greek pantheon, lending credence to the idea that the Macedonian ruling house possessed the divine right of kings.; . Herodotus wrote that Alexander I of Macedon () convinced the Hellanodikai authorities of the Ancient Olympic Games that his Argive lineage could be traced back to Temenus, and thus his perceived Greek identity permitted him to enter the Olympic competitions.; . Very little is known about the first five kings of Macedonia (or the first eight kings depending on which royal chronology is accepted).; . There is much greater evidence for the reigns of Amyntas I of Macedon () and his successor Alexander I, especially due to the aid given by the latter to the Persian commander Mardonius at the Battle of Platea in 479 BC, during the Greco-Persian Wars.. Although stating that the first several kings listed by Herodotus were most likely legendary figures, historian Robert Malcolm Errington uses the rough estimate of twenty- five years for the reign of each of these kings to assume that the capital Aigai (modern Vergina) could have been under their rule since roughly the mid-7th century BC, during the Archaic period.. octadrachm of Alexander I of Macedon (), minted , showing an equestrian figure wearing a chlamys (short cloak) and petasos (head cap) while holding two spears and leading a horse The kingdom was situated in the fertile alluvial plain, watered by the rivers Haliacmon and Axius, called Lower Macedonia, north of Mount Olympus. Around the time of Alexander I, the Argead Macedonians started to expand into Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Greek tribes like the Lyncestae and the Elimiotae, and to the west, beyond the Axius river, into the Emathia, Eordaia, Bottiaea, Mygdonia, Crestonia and Almopia; regions settled by, among others, many Thracian tribes., see also for the Macedonian expulsion of original inhabitants such as the Phrygians. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest.. To the south lay Thessaly, with whose inhabitants the Macedonians had much in common, both culturally and politically, while to the west lay Epirus, with whom the Macedonians had a peaceful relationship and in the 4th century BC formed an alliance against Illyrian raids.. Prior to the 4th century BC, the kingdom covered a region approximately corresponding to the western and central parts of the region of Macedonia in modern Greece.. After Darius I of Persia () launched a military campaign against the Scythians in Europe in 513 BC, he left behind his general Megabazus to quell the Paeonians, Thracians, and coastal Greek city-states of the southern Balkans.; ; . In 512/511 BC Megabazus sent envoys demanding Macedonian submission as a vassal state to the Achaemenid Empire of ancient Persia, to which Amyntas I responded by formally accepting the hegemony of the Persian king of kings.; ; ; Errington seems far less convinced that at this point Amyntas I of Macedon offered any submission as a vassal at all, at most a token one. He also mentions how the Macedonian king pursued his own course of action, such as inviting the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias to take refuge at Anthemous in 506 BC. This began the period of Achaemenid Macedonia, which lasted for roughly three decades. The Macedonian kingdom was largely autonomous and outside of Persian control, but was expected to provide troops and provisions for the Achaemenid army.. Amyntas II, son of Amyntas I's daughter Gygaea of Macedon and her husband Bubares, son of Megabazus, was given the Phrygian city of Alabanda as an appanage by Xerxes I (), to secure the Persian-Macedonian marriage alliance.; ; . Persian authority over Macedonia was interrupted by the Ionian Revolt (499‚Äì493 BC), yet the Persian general Mardonius was able to subjugate Macedonia, bringing it under Persian rule.; ; . It is doubtful, though, that Macedonia was ever officially included within a Persian satrapy (i.e. province).. The Macedonian king Alexander I must have viewed his subordination as an opportunity to aggrandize his own position, since he used Persian military support to extend his own borders.; . The Macedonians provided military aid to Xerxes I during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480‚Äì479 BC, which saw Macedonians and Persians fighting against a Greek coalition led by Athens and Sparta.; . Following the Greek victory at Salamis, the Persians sent Alexander I as an envoy to Athens, hoping to strike an alliance with their erstwhile foe, yet his diplomatic mission was rebuffed.. Achaemenid control over Macedonia ceased when the Persians were ultimately defeated by the Greeks and fled the Greek mainland in Europe.; ; see also for further details. Involvement in the Classical Greek world tetraobol coins issued during the reign of Perdiccas II () Macedon (orange) during the Peloponnesian War around 431 BC, with Athens and the Delian League (yellow), Sparta and Peloponnesian League (red), independent states (blue), and the Persian Achaemenid Empire (purple). Alexander I, who Herodotus claimed was entitled proxenos and euergetes ('benefactor') by the Athenians, cultivated a close relationship with the Greeks following the Persian defeat and withdrawal, sponsoring the erection of statues at both major panhellenic sanctuaries at Delphi and Olympia.; . After his death in 454 BC, he was granted the posthumous title Alexander I 'the Philhellene' ('friend of the Greeks'), perhaps designated by later Hellenistic Alexandrian scholars, most certainly preserved by the Greco-Roman historian Dio Chrysostom, and most likely influenced by Macedonian propaganda of the 4th century BC that emphasized the positive role the ancestors of Philip II () had in Greek affairs.. Alexander I's successor Perdicas II () was not only saddled with internal revolt by the petty kings of Upper Macedonia, but also faced serious challenges to Macedonian territorial integrity by Sitalces, a ruler in Thrace, and the Athenians, who fought four separate wars against Macedonia under Perdiccas II.. During his reign, Athenian settlers began to encroach upon his coastal territories in Lower Macedonia to gather resources such as timber and pitch in support of their navy, a practice that was actively encouraged by the Athenian leader Pericles when he had colonists settle among the Bisaltae along the Strymon River.; see also for further details. From 476 BC onward, the Athenians coerced some of the coastal towns of Macedonia along the Aegean Sea to join the Athenian-led Delian League as tributary states and in 437/436 BC founded the city of Amphipolis at the mouth of the Strymon River for access to timber as well as gold and silver from the Pangaion Hills.; ; ; see also for further details. War broke out in 433 BC when Athens, perhaps seeking additional cavalry and resources in anticipation of the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC), allied with a brother and cousin of Perdiccas II who were in open rebellion against him.. This led Perdiccas to seek alliances with Athens' rivals Sparta and Corinth, yet when his efforts were rejected he instead promoted the rebellion of nearby nominal Athenian allies in Chalcidice, winning over the important city of Potidaea.; see also for further details. Athens responded by sending a naval invasion force that captured Therma and laid siege to Pydna. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking Chalcidice and Potidaea due to stretching their forces thin by fighting the Macedonians and their allies on multiple fronts, and therefore sued for peace with Macedonia.. War resumed shortly after with the Athenian capture of Beroea and Macedonian aid given to the Potidaeans during an Athenian siege, yet by 431 BC, the Athenians and Macedonians concluded a peace treaty and alliance orchestrated by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom.. The Athenians had hoped to use Sitalces against the Macedonians, but due to Sitalces' desire to focus on acquiring more Thracian allies, he convinced Athens to make peace with Macedonia on the condition that he provide cavalry and peltasts for the Athenian army in Chalcidice.. Under this arrangement, Perdiccas II was given back Therma and no longer had to contend with his rebellious brother, Athens, and Sitacles all at once; in exchange he aided the Athenians in their subjugation of settlements in Chalcidice.; . In 429 BC, Perdiccas II sent aid to the Spartan commander Cnemus in Acarnania, but the Macedonian forces arrived too late to enter the Battle of Naupactus, which ended in an Athenian victory.. In that same year, Sitalces, according to Thucydides, invaded Macedonia at the behest of Athens to aid them in subduing Chalcidice and to punish Perdiccas II for violating the terms of their peace treaty.; . However, given Sitalces' huge Thracian invading force (allegedly 150,000 soldiers) and a nephew of Perdiccas II that he intended to place on the Macedonian throne after toppling the latter's regime, Athens must have become wary of acting on their supposed alliance since they failed to provide him with promised naval support.; . Sitalces eventually retreated from Macedonia, perhaps due to logistical concerns: a shortage of provisions and harsh winter conditions.; . In 424 BC, Perdiccas began to play a prominent role in the Peloponnesian War by aiding the Spartan general Brasidas in convincing Athenian allies in Thrace to defect and ally with Sparta.; . After failing to convince Perdiccas II to make peace with Arrhabaeus of Lynkestis (a small region of Upper Macedonia), Brasidas agreed to aid the Macedonian fight against Arrhabaeus, although he expressed his concerns about leaving his Chalcidian allies to their own devices against Athens, as well as the fearsome Illyrian reinforcements arriving on the side of Arrhabaeus.; . The massive combined force commanded by Arrhabaeus apparently caused the army of Perdiccas II to flee in haste before the battle began, which enraged the Spartans under Brasidas, who proceeded to snatch pieces of the Macedonian baggage train left unprotected.; . Subsequently, Perdiccas II not only made peace with Athens but switched sides, blocking Peloponnesian reinforcements from reaching Brasidas via Thessaly.; . The treaty offered Athens economic concessions, but it also guaranteed internal stability in Macedonia since Arrhabaeus and other domestic detractors were convinced to lay down their arms and accept Perdiccas II as their suzerain lord.. A Macedonian didrachm minted during the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon () Perdiccas II was obliged to send aid to the Athenian general Cleon, but he and Brasidas died in 422 BC, and the Peace of Nicias struck in the following year between Athens and Sparta nullified the Macedonian king's responsibilities as an erstwhile Athenian ally.; . After the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC, Sparta and Argos formed a new alliance, which, alongside the threat of neighboring poleis in Chalcidice who were aligned with Sparta, induced Perdiccas II to abandon his Athenian alliance in favor of Sparta once again.; see also for further details. This proved to be a strategic error, since Argos quickly switched sides as a pro-Athenian democracy, allowing Athens to punish Macedonia with a naval blockade in 417 BC along with the resumption of military activity in Chalcidice.; see also for further details. Perdiccas II agreed to a peace settlement and alliance with Athens once more in 414 BC and, on his death a year later, was succeeded by his son Archelaus I ().; . Archelaus I maintained good relations with Athens throughout his reign, relying on Athens to provide naval support in his 410 BC siege of Pydna, and in exchange providing Athens with timber and naval equipment.; . With improvements to military organization and building of new infrastructure such as fortresses, Archelaus was able to strengthen Macedonia and project his power into Thessaly, where he aided his allies; yet he faced some internal revolt as well as problems fending off Illyrian incursions led by Sirras.. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, Archelaus I moved the capital of the kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea.; . He improved Macedonia's currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage.. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides.; . A silver stater of Amyntas III of Macedon () A stater of Perdiccas III of Macedon () Historical sources offer wildly different and confused accounts as to who assassinated Archelaus I, although it likely involved a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court.; . What ensued was a power struggle lasting from 399 to 393 BC of four different monarchs claiming the throne: Orestes, son of Archelaus I; Aeropus II, uncle, regent, and murderer of Orestes; Pausanias, son of Aeropus II; and Amyntas II, who was married to the youngest daughter of Archelaus I.; . Very little is known about this period, although each of these monarchs aside from Orestes managed to mint debased currency imitating that of Archelaus I.. Finally, Amyntas III (), son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of Amyntas I, succeeded to the throne by killing Pausanias. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus provided a seemingly conflicting account about Illyrian invasions occurring in 393 BC and 383 BC, which may have been representative of a single invasion led by Bardylis of the Dardani.; see also for further details. In this event, Amyntas III is said to have fled his own kingdom and returned with the support of Thessalian allies, while a possible pretender to the throne named Argaeus had ruled temporarily in Amyntas III's absence.; see also for further details. When the powerful Chalcidian city of Olynthos was allegedly poised to overthrow Amyntas III and conquer the Macedonian kingdom, Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, sailed to Macedonia with a large Spartan force to provide critical aid to Amyntas III.; The result of this campaign in 379 BC was the surrender of Olynthos and the abolition of the Chalcidian League.; . Amyntas III had children with two wives, but it was his eldest son by his marriage with Eurydice I who succeeded him as Alexander II ().; . When Alexander II invaded Thessaly and occupied Larissa and Crannon as a challenge to the suzerainty of the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, the Thessalians appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for help to expel both of these rival overlords.; . After Pelopidas captured Larissa, Alexander II made peace and allied with Thebes, handing over noble hostages including his brother and future king, Philip II.; . Afterwards, Ptolemy of Aloros assassinated his brother-in-law Alexander II and acted as regent for the latter's younger brother Perdiccas III ().; . Ptolemy's intervention in Thessaly in 367 BC provoked another Theban invasion by Pelopidas, who was undermined when Ptolemy bribed his mercenaries not to fight, thus leading to a newly proposed alliance between Macedonia and Thebes, but only on the condition that more hostages, including one of his Ptolemy's sons, were to be handed over to Thebes.; . By 365 BC, Perdiccas III had reached the age of majority and took the opportunity to kill his regent Ptolemy, initiating a sole reign marked by internal stability, financial recovery, fostering of Greek intellectualism at his court, and the return of his brother Philip from Thebes. However, Perdiccas III also dealt with an Athenian invasion by Timotheus, son of Conon, that led to the loss of Methone and Pydna, while an invasion of Illyrians led by Bardylis succeeded in killing Perdiccas III and 4,000 Macedonian troops in battle.; . Rise of Macedon Philip II of Macedon (), who spent much of his adolescence as a political hostage in Thebes, was twenty-four years old when he acceded to the throne and immediately faced crises that threatened to topple his leadership.; . However, with the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to convince the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their backing of another pretender named Arg(a)eus (perhaps the same who had caused trouble for Amyntas III).; . He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and removing a garrison of Macedonian troops from Amphipolis, establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to that city.; ; . He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.. Map of the Kingdom of Macedon at the death of Philip II in 336 BC (light blue), with the original territory that existed in 431 BC (red outline), and dependent states (yellow) The exact date in which Philip II initiated reforms to radically transform the Macedonian army's organization, equipment, and training is unknown, including the formation of the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the sarissa). The reforms took place over a period of several years and proved immediately successful against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies.. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much Philip II's royal predecessors may have contributed to these military reforms. It is perhaps more likely that his years of captivity in Thebes during the Theban hegemony influenced his ideas, especially after meeting with the renowned general Epaminondas.. Although Macedonia and the rest of Greece traditionally practiced monogamy in marriage, Philip II divulged in the 'barbarian' practice of polygamy, marrying seven different wives with perhaps only one that didn't involve the loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or the affirmation of a new alliance.; M√ºller is skeptical about the claims of Plutarch and Athenaeus that Philip II of Macedon married Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon, a younger woman, purely out of love or due to his own midlife crisis. Cleopatra was the daughter of the general Attalus, who along with his father-in-law Parmenion were given command posts in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) soon after this wedding. M√ºller also suspects that this marriage was one of political convenience meant to ensure the loyalty of an influential Macedonian noble house. For instance, his first marriages were to Phila of Elimeia of the Upper Macedonian aristocracy as well as the Illyrian princess Audata, granddaughter(?) of Bardylis, to ensure a marriage alliance with their people.. To establish an alliance with Larissa in Thessaly, he married the Thessalian noblewoman Philinna in 358 BC, who bore him a son who would later rule as Philip III Arrhidaeus ().; . In 357 BC, he married Olympias in order to secure an alliance with Arybbas, the King of Epirus and the Molossians. This marriage would bear a son who would later rule as Alexander III (better known as Alexander the Great) and claim descent from the legendary Achilles by way of his dynastic heritage from Epirus.; . It has been argued whether or not the Achaemenid Persian kings influenced Philip's practice of polygamy, although it seems to have been practiced by Amyntas III who had three sons with a possible second wife Gygaea: Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus.; . Philip II had Archelaus put to death in 359 BC, while Philip's other two half brothers fled to Olynthos, serving as a casus belli for the Olynthian War (349‚Äì348 BC) against the Chalcidian League.; ; . While Athens was preoccupied with the Social War (357‚Äì355 BC), Philip took this opportunity to retake Amphipolis in 357 BC, for which the Athenians later declared war on him, and by 356 BC, recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he handed over to the Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty of 357/356 BC.; ; . In this year, he was also able to take Crenides, later refounded as Philippi and providing much wealth in gold, while his general Parmenion was victorious against the Illyrian king Grabos of the Grabaei.; ; ; . During the siege of Methone from 355 to 354 BC, Philip lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but was able to capture the city and was even cordial to the defeated inhabitants (unlike the Potidaeans, who had been sold into slavery).; ; ; Cawkwell contrarily provides the date of this siege as 354‚Äì353 BC. It was at this stage when Philip II involved Macedonia in the Third Sacred War (356‚Äì346 BC). The conflict began when Phocis captured and plundered the temple of Apollo at Delphi as a response to Thebes' demand that they submit unpaid fines, causing the Amphictyonic League to declare war on Phocis and a civil war among the members of the Thessalian League aligned with either Phocis or Thebes.; . Philip II's initial campaign against Pherae in Thessaly in 353 BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general Onomarchus.; ; ; ; Conversely, Buckler provides the date of this initial campaign as 354 BC, while affirming that the second Thessalian campaign ending in the Battle of Crocus Field occurred in 353 BC. However, he returned the following year and defeated Onomarchus at the Battle of Crocus Field, which led to his election as leader (archon) of the Thessalian League, ability to recruit Thessalian cavalry, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council and a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis, niece of the tyrant Jason of Pherae.; ; ; . Niketerion (victory medallion) bearing the effigy of king Philip II of Macedon, 3rd century AD, probably minted during the reign of Roman Emperor Alexander Severus. After campaigning against the Thracian ruler Cersobleptes, Philip II began his war against the Chalcidian League in 349 BC, which had been reestablished in 375 BC following a temporary disbandment.; ; . Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus,. Olynthos was captured by Philip II in 348 BC, whereupon he sold its inhabitants into slavery, bringing back some Athenian citizens to Macedonia as slaves as well.; ; . The Athenians, especially in a series of speeches by Demosthenes known as the Olynthiacs, were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack, so in 346 BC, they concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates.; ; . The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that Philip would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese.; . Meanwhile, Phocis and Thermopylae were captured, the Delphic temple robbers executed, and Philip II was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council as well as the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games.; ; ; . Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they were eventually swayed to accept these conditions, partially due to the oration On the Peace by Demosthenes.. For the next few years Philip II was occupied with reorganizing the administrative system of Thessaly, campaigning against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I, deposing Arybbas in Epirus in favor of his brother-in-law Alexander I (through Philip II's marriage with Olympias), and defeating Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Asia.; ; ; ; . In what is now Bulgaria, Philip II conquered the Thracian city of Panegyreis in 342 BC and reestablished it as Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Roman-era Trimontium).. War broke out with Athens in 340 BC while Philip II was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonia's involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339 BC.; ; . Hostilities between Thebes and Macedonia began when Thebes ousted a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea (near Thermopylae), leading Thebes to join Athens, Megara, Corinth, Achaea, and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.; . The Athenian oligarch Philippides of Paiania was instrumental in the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea by assisting PhilipII's cause, but was later prosecuted in Athens as a traitor by the orator and statesman Hypereides. After the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea, Philip II imposed harsh conditions on Thebes, installing an oligarchy there, yet was lenient to Athens due to his desire to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire.; . He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek city-states minus Sparta, being elected as the leader (hegemon) of its council (synedrion) by the spring of 337 BC despite the Kingdom of Macedonia being excluded as an official member of the league.; ; see also for further details. The Panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece perhaps contributed to Philip II's decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persian aid offered to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341-340 BC highlighted Macedonia's strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential. The ruins of the Philippeion at Olympia, Greece, which was built by Philip II of Macedon to celebrate his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After his election by the League of Corinth as their commander-in-chief (strategos autokrator) of a forthcoming campaign to invade the Achaemenid Empire, Philip II sought to shore up further Macedonian support by marrying Cleopatra Eurydice, niece of general Attalus. Yet talk of providing new potential heirs infuriated Philip II's son Alexander (already a veteran of the Battle of Chaeronea) and his mother Olympias, who fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella.; . Further tensions arose when Philip II offered his son Arrhidaeus's hand in marriage to Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria. When Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead, Philip cancelled the wedding arrangements altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus.; see also for further details. To reconcile with Olympias, Philip II had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of Epirus, yet Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander.; ; ; see for details of the arrests and judicial trials of other suspects in the conspiracy to assassinate Philip II of Macedon. Empire The empire of Alexander the Great at the time of his death in 323 BC Before Philip II was assassinated in the summer of 336 BC, relations with his son Alexander had degenerated to the point where he excluded him entirely from his planned invasion of Asia, choosing instead for him to act as regent of Greece and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth.; . This, alongside his mother Olympias' apparent concern over Philip II bearing another potential heir with his new wife Cleopatra Eurydice, have led scholars to wrangle over the idea of her and Alexander's possible roles in Philip's murder.; ; Without implicating Alexander III of Macedon as a potential suspect in the plot to assassinate Philip II of Macedon, N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank discuss possible Macedonian as well as foreign suspects, such as Demosthenes and Darius III: . Nonetheless, Alexander III () was immediately proclaimed king by an assembly of the army and leading aristocrats, chief among them being Antipater and Parmenion.; ; ; ; see also for further details. By the end of his reign and military career in 323 BC, Alexander would rule over an empire consisting of mainland Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and much of Central and South Asia (i.e. modern Pakistan).. His first pressing concerns, however, would be to bury his father at Aigai and to pursue a campaign of suppression closer to home in the Balkans.. Following Philip's death, the members of the League of Corinth revolted, yet were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy, Alexander forcing them to rejoin the league and elect him as hegemon to carry out the planned invasion of Achaemenid Persia.; see also for further details. Alexander also took the opportunity to settle the score he had with his rival Attalus (who had taunted him during the wedding feast of his daughter Cleopatra Eurydice and Philip II) by having him executed.. In 335 BC, Alexander led a campaign against the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons, fighting them along the Danube and forcing their surrender on Peuce Island.; . Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king Cleitus of the Dardani threatened to attack Macedonia, yet Alexander took the initiative and besieged them at Pelion (in modern Albania).; . When Alexander was given news that Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and were besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege.; see also and for further details. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned the city to the ground as a warning to others, which proved effective since no other Greek state aside from Sparta dared to challenge Alexander for the remainder of his reign.; see also for further details. Throughout his military career and kingship, Alexander won every battle that he personally commanded.. His first victory against the Persians in Asia Minor at the Battle of the Granicus in 334 BC utilized a small cavalry contingent that successfully distracted the Persians, allowed his infantry to cross the river, and his Companions to drive them from the battle with a cavalry charge.. Following the tradition of Macedonian warrior kings, Alexander personally led the cavalry charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, forcing the Persian king Darius III and his army to flee. Darius III, despite having superior numbers, was again forced to flee the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. The Persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of Bactria and kinsman, Bessus, in 330 BC. The Macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed Bessus in what is now Afghanistan, securing the region of Sogdia in the process.; . At the 326 BC Battle of the Hydaspes (modern-day Punjab), when the war elephants of King Porus of the Pauravas threatened Alexander's troops, he had them form open ranks to surround the elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their sarissa pikes.. When his Macedonian troops threatened mutiny at Opis, Babylonia (near modern Baghdad, Iraq) in 324 BC, Alexander III offered Macedonian military titles and greater responsibilities to Persian officers and units instead, forcing his troops to seek forgiveness, which the king offered at a banquet urging reconciliation between Persians and Macedonians.; . The Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion, one of Alexander's loyal companions. Despite his skills as a commander, Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC.. When he attempted to have his men prostrate before him at Bactra in 327 BC in an act of proskynesis (borrowed from the Persian kings), the Macedonians and Greeks considered this blasphemy and usurpation of the authority of the gods. Alexander's court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual there and the others took his example, an act of protest that led Alexander to abandon the practice.. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people,\\" according to Errington.. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington.. He also pursued the polygamous habits of his father Philip II and encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria.. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.. Meanwhile, in Greece the only disturbance to Macedonian rule was the attempt by the Spartan king Agis III to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against the Macedonians.; . However, he was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead.; ; Gilley and Worthington discuss the ambiguity about the exact title of Antipater aside from deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth, with some sources calling him a regent, others a governor, others a simple general. N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank state that Alexander the Great left \\"Macedonia under the command of Antipater, in case there was a rising in Greece.\\" . Although the governor of Thrace, Memnon, had threatened to rebel, it appears that Antipater dissuaded him with diplomacy before campaigning against Agis III in the Peloponnese.; . Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install them in the first place).. A golden stater of Philip III Arrhidaeus () bearing images of Athena (left) and Nike (right) When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction with poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this.; see also for further details. With no official heir apparent, the loyalties of the Macedonian military command became split between one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus () as king and another siding with Alexander's infant son with Roxana, Alexander IV ().; see also for further details. Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323‚Äì322 BC).; ; . When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege.; ; . Although Antipater ultimately subdued the rebellion, he died in 319 BC and left a vacuum of power wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army who were now carving up his empire.; see also for further details. thumbKingdoms of the diadochi c. 301 BC, after the Battle of Ipsus Other A council of the army convened immediately after Alexander's death in Babylon, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent.; . However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great.; . When Perdiccas invaded Egypt in the summer of 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him.; . Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus.; . The council appointed Antipater as regent over the two kings, after which Antipater delegated authority to the leading generals. However, before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as the regent to succeed him, passing over his own son Cassander, ignoring the right of the king to choose a regent (since Philip III was considered mentally unstable), and bypassing the council of the army as well.; . Forming an alliance with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319‚Äì315 BC).; . Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317 BC Philip III, by way of his politically-engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias, mother of Alexander III who still resided in Epirus.; . A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide.; . Olympias then had Nicanor killed along with dozens of leading Macedonian nobles, yet by the spring of 316 BC Cassander defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.; . Cassander married Philip II's daughter Thessalonike, inducting him into the Argead dynastic house, and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos, although by 313 BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii.. By 316 BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his satrapy of Babylonia; in reaction to this a coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus issued an ultimatum to Antigonus in 315 BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia.. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, king Alexander IV and the queen mother Roxana.. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311 BC, when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as 'first in Asia', Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace.. Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana put to death in the winter of 311/310 BC, had Heracles of Macedon executed in 309 BC as part of a peace settlement with Polyperchon, and by 306‚Äì305 BC the diadochi were declared kings of their respective territories.; . Hellenistic era The beginning of Hellenistic Greece was defined by the struggle between the Antipatrid dynasty, led first by Cassander (), son of Antipater, and the Antigonid dynasty, led by Antigonus I Monophthalmus () and his son, the future king Demetrius I of Macedon (). While Cassander was besieging Athens in 303 BC, Demetrius invaded Boeotia in order to sever Cassander's path of retreat back to Macedonia, although Cassander managed to hastily abandon the siege and march back to Macedonia.; . While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate Philip II's Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter () of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, Seleucus I Nicator () of the Seleucid Empire, and Lysimachus (), King of Thrace decisively defeated the Antigonids at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, killing Antigonus and forcing Demetrius into flight.; ; . Cassander died in 297 BC and his sickly son Philip IV of Macedon died the same year, being succeeded by Cassander's other sons Alexander V of Macedon () and Antipater II of Macedon (), with their mother Thessalonike of Macedon acting as regent. While Demetrius fought against the Antipatrid forces in Greece, Antipater II killed his own mother and regent to obtain power. His desperate brother Alexander V then requested aid from Pyrrhus of Epirus (), who had fought alongside Demetrius at the Battle of Ipsus, yet spent time as a hostage in Egypt as stipulated in an alliance treaty between Demetrius and Ptolemy I.. In exchange for defeating the forces of Antipater II and forcing him to flee to the court of Lysimachus in Thrace, Pyrrhus was awarded the westernmost portions of the Macedonian kingdom.; . Demetrius marched north and invited his nephew Alexander V into his camp for a banquet on friendly pretenses, yet had him assassinated as he attempted to leave. Demetrius was then proclaimed king in Macedonia, yet his subjects became increasingly concerned by his conduct as a seemingly aloof monarch and Eastern-style autocrat.. War broke out between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290 BC when Lanassa, wife of Pyrrhus, daughter of Agathocles of Syracuse, left him for Demetrius and offered him her dowry of Corcyra. The war dragged on until 288 BC, when Demetrius lost the support of the Macedonians and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the former taking western Macedonia and the latter eastern Macedonia.; . By 286 BC, Lysimachus was able to expel Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia altogether, yet in 282 BC, a new war erupted between Lysimachus and Seleucus I.; ; ; Conversely, Errington dates Lysimachus' reunification of Macedonia by expelling Pyrrhus of Epirus as 284 BC, not 286 BC. The conflict came to a head at the Battle of Corupedion where Lysimachus was killed, allowing Seleucus I to claim both Thrace and Macedonia.; ; . In yet another reversal of fortunes, Seleucus I was then assassinated in 281 BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos, son of Ptolemy I and grandson of Antipater, who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia. There was little respite from the political chaos in Macedonia, though, since Ptolemy Keraunos was killed in battle in 279 BC by Celtic invaders in the Gallic invasion of Greece.; ; . The Macedonian army proclaimed the general Sosthenes of Macedon as king, although he apparently refused the title.. After defeating the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the raiding party of Brennus, Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia.. The Gallic warbands ravaged Macedonia until the arrival of Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, who defeated them in Thrace at the Battle of Lysimachia in 277 BC. He was then proclaimed king Antigonus II of Macedon ().; ; . Beginning in 280 BC, Pyrrhus embarked on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily.; . Ptolemy Keraunos had secured his position on the Macedonian throne by gifting Pyrrhus five-thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the stalemate and ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome now that Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum became Roman allies. Despite having a depleted treasury, Pyrrhus decided to invade Macedonia in 274 BC, due to the perceived political instability of Antigonus II's regime. After defeating the largely mercenary army of Antigonus II at the 274 BC Battle of Aous, Pyrrhus was able to drive him out of Macedonia and force him to take refuge with his naval fleet.; ; . Ancient Macedonian paintings of Hellenistic-era military arms and armor from a tomb in ancient Mieza (modern-day Lefkadia), Imathia, Central Macedonia, Greece, 2nd century BC Pyrrhus lost much of his support among the Macedonians in 273 BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal cemetery of Aigai.; . Pyrrhus pursued Antigonus II in Greece, yet while he was occupied with the war in the Peloponnese, Antigonus II was able to recapture Macedonia. While battling for control over Argos in 272 BC, Pyrrhus was killed while fighting in the city's streets, allowing Antigonus II to reclaim Greece as well.; ; . He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai by constructing a massive tumulus.; . Antigonus II also secured the Illyrian front and annexed Paeonia.. The Antigonid naval fleets docked at Corinth and Chalkis during the reign of Antigonus II also proved instrumental in the maintenance of Antigonid-imposed local regimes in various Greek cities.. However, the Aetolian League proved to be a perennial problem for Antigonus II's ambitions in controlling central Greece, while the formation of the Achaean League in 251 BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta.; see also about the resurgence of Sparta under Areus I. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia during the Syrian Wars against Ptolemaic Egypt, the latter used its powerful navy to disrupt Antigonus II's efforts in controlling mainland Greece.; . With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War (267‚Äì261 BC).; . However, by 265 BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by Antigonus II's forces, a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos, and Athens finally surrendered in 261 BC.; . After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II, a peace settlement between Antigonus II and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt was finally struck in 255 BC.. Temple of Apollo at Corinth, built c. 540 BC, with the Acrocorinth (i.e. the acropolis of Corinth that once held a Macedonian garrison) seen in the background However, in 251 BC, Aratus of Sicyon led a rebellion against Antigonus II and in 250 BC, Ptolemy II openly threw his support behind the self-proclaimed king Alexander of Corinth.; . Although Alexander died in 246 BC and Antigonus was able to score a naval victory against the Ptolemies at the Battle of Andros, the Macedonians lost the Acrocorinth to the forces of Aratus in 243 BC, followed by the induction of Corinth into the Achaean League.; . Antigonus II finally made peace with the Achaean League in a treaty of 240 BC, ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece.; . Antigonus II died in 239 BC and was succeeded by his son Demetrius II of Macedon (). Seeking an alliance with Macedonia to defend against the Aetolians, the queen mother and regent Olympias II of Epirus offered her daughter Phthia of Macedon to Demetrius II in marriage, which he accepted yet damaged relations with the Seleucids by divorcing Stratonice of Macedon.; . Although the Aetolians formed an alliance with the Achaean League as a result, Demetrius II was able to invade Boeotia and capture it from the Aetolians by 236 BC.. Demetrius II's control of Greece diminished by the end of his reign, though, when he lost Megalopolis in 235 BC and most of the Peloponnese except Argos to the Achaean League.; . He also was denied an ally in Epirus when the monarchy was toppled in a republican revolution.; . Demetrius II's struggle to defend Acarnania against Aetolia became so desperate that he enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron, whose Illyrian pirates raided the coasts of western Greece and even defeated the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos in 229 BC. Yet another Illyrian ruler Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of Demetrius II shortly before his death in 229 BC.; . Although his child son, Philip immediately inherited the throne, his regent Antigonus III Doson (), nephew of Antigonus II, was proclaimed king by the army and Philip as his heir following a string of military victories against the Illyrians in the north and the Aetolians in Thessaly.; . A tetradrachm minted during the reign of Antigonus III Doson (), possibly at Amphipolis, bearing the portrait image of Poseidon on the obverse and a scene on the reverse depicting Apollo sitting on the prow of a ship Although the Achaean League had been fighting Macedonia for decades, Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226 BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229‚Äì222 BC).; ; see also for further details. In exchange for military aid, Antigonus III demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225 BC.; ; . Antigonus III's first move against Sparta was to capture Arcadia in the spring of 224 BC.. After reforming a Hellenic league in the same vein as Philip II's League of Corinth and hiring Illyrian mercenaries for additional support, Antigonus III managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC.; ; . For the first time in Sparta's history, their city was then occupied by a foreign power, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece.; see also about the Macedonian military's occupation of Sparta following the Battle of Sellasia. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor Philip V.; . Philip V of Macedon () was only 17 when he acceded to the throne and, despite the successes of his predecessor Antigonus III, faced immediate challenges to his authority by the Illyrian Dardani and Aetolian League.; . Philip V and his allies were successful against the Aetolians and their allies in the Social War (220‚Äì217 BC), yet Philip V pursued a peace settlement with the Aetolians once he heard of a renewed presence of the Dardani in the north and the Carthaginian victory over the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC.; . Demetrius of Pharos is alleged to have convinced Philip V to first secure Illyria in advance of an invasion of the Italian peninsula.; see also for further details; Errington seems less convinced that Philip V at this point had any intentions of invading southern Italy via Illyria once the latter was secured, deeming his plans to be \\"more modest\\", . In 216 BC, Philip V sent a hundred light warships into the Adriatic Sea to attack Illyria, a motion that did not go unnoticed by Rome when Scerdilaidas of the Ardiaean Kingdom appealed to the Romans for aid.; . Rome responded by sending ten heavy quinqueremes from Roman Sicily to patrol the Illyrian coasts, causing Philip V to reverse course and order his fleet to retreat, averting open conflict for the time being.; . Conflict with Rome Philip V (), with Macedonian dependent states (dark yellow), the Seleucid Empire (bright yellow), Roman protectorates (dark green), the Kingdom of Pergamon (light green), independent states (light purple), and possessions of the Ptolemaic Empire (violet purple) In 215 BC, at the height of the Second Punic War with the Carthaginian Empire, Roman authorities intercepted a ship off the Calabrian coast holding both a Macedonian envoy and a Carthaginian ambassador to Macedonia, who possessed a Punic document (later translated into Greek and preserved by Polybius) of Hannibal Barca declaring an alliance with Philip V of Macedon.; ; ; also mentioned by . The treaty stipulated that Carthage had the sole right to negotiate terms with Rome after its hypothetical surrender, yet it deferred to the Macedonian interests in the Adriatic Sea and promised mutual aid in the event that a resurgent Rome, after losing its allies in northern and southern Italy, should lash out at either Macedonia or Carthage in revenge.; see also and for further details. Although the Macedonians were perhaps only interested in safeguarding their conquered territories in Illyria,. the Romans were nevertheless able to thwart Philip V's ambitions in the Adriatic during the First Macedonian War (214‚Äì205 BC). In 214 BC, Rome positioned a naval fleet at Oricus when it along with Apollonia were assaulted by Macedonian forces.; . When the Macedonians captured Lissus in 212 BC and potentially threatened southern Italy in support of Hannibal, the Roman Senate responded by inciting the Aetolian League, as well as Attalus I () of Pergamon, Sparta, Elis, and Messenia to wage war against Philip V, keeping him occupied and away from the Italian peninsula.; ; ; . A year after the Aetolian League concluded a peace agreement with Philip V in 206 BC, the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice, which ended the war and allowed the Macedonians to retain the settlements they had captured in Illyria.; ; ; ; see also for details on the Aetolian League's treaty with Philip V of Macedon and Rome's rejection of the second attempt by the Aetolians to seek Roman aid, viewing the Aetolians as having violated the earlier treaty. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202 BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201 BC.; see also for further details. These states grew increasingly concerned once Philip V formed an alliance with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202‚Äì195 BC), while Philip V captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea.; ; see also for further details. Although Rome's envoys played a critical role in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200 BC, the comitia centuriata (i.e. people's assembly) rejected the Roman Senate's proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia.; ; ; . Meanwhile, Philip V conquered vital territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos, which led Rhodes to form an alliance with Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and Chios against Macedonia.; see also for further details. Despite Philip V's nominal alliance with the Seleucid king, he lost the naval Battle of Chios in 201 BC and was subsequently blockaded at Bargylia by a combined fleet of the victorious Rhodian and Pergamene navies.; . A tetradrachm of Philip V of Macedon (), with the king's portrait on the obverse and Athena Alkidemos brandishing a thunderbolt on the reverse While Philip V was ensnared in a conflict with several Greek maritime powers, Rome viewed these unfolding events as an opportunity to punish a former ally of Hannibal, come to the aid of its Greek allies, and commit to a war that perhaps required a limited amount of resources in order to achieve victory.. With Carthage finally subdued following the Second Punic War, Bringmann contends that the Roman strategy changed from protecting southern Italy from Macedonia, to exacting revenge on Philip V for allying with Hannibal.; see also : \\"Roman desire for revenge and private hopes of famous victories were probably the decisive reasons for the outbreak of the war.\\" However, Arthur M. Eckstein stresses that the Roman Senate \\"did not plot long range-strategies\\" and instead \\"lurched from crisis to crisis\\" while allowing itself to become involved in the Hellenistic east only at the strong urging of its allies and despite its own exhausted and war-weary populace.. The Roman Senate demanded that Philip V cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for any and all grievances. Seeking either war or humiliation for the Macedonian king, his predictable rejection of their proposal served as a useful tool of propaganda demonstrating the honorable and philhellenic intentions of the Romans contrasted with the combative and antagonistic Macedonian response.. When the comitia centuriata finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate's declaration of war and handed their ultimatum to Philip V by the summer of 200 BC, demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it outright. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War (200‚Äì197 BC), with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations by landing at Apollonia along the coast of Illyria with two Roman legions.; ; see also for further details. Bronze bust of Eumenes II of Pergamon, a Roman copy of a Hellenistic Greek original, from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum Although the Macedonians were able to successfully defend their territory for roughly two years,. the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus managed to expel Philip V from Macedonia in 198 BC with him and his forces taking refuge in Thessaly.. When the Achaean League abandoned Philip V to join the Roman-led coalition, the Macedonian king sued for peace, but the terms offered were considered too stringent and so the war continued. In June 197 BC, the Macedonians were defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae.; ; . Rome, dismissing the Aetolian League's demands to dismantle the Macedonian monarchy altogether, ratified a treaty that forced Macedonia to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions, including Corinth, while allowing it to preserve its core territory, if only to act as a buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece.; ; . Although the Greeks, especially the Aetolians, suspected Roman intentions of supplanting Macedonia as the new hegemonic power in Greece, Flaminius announced at the Isthmian Games of 196 BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek liberty by leaving behind no garrisons or exacting tribute of any kind.; . This promise was delayed due to the Spartan king Nabis capturing Argos, necessitating Roman intervention and a peace settlement with the Spartans, yet the Romans finally evacuated Greece in the spring of 194 BC.; see also and for further details. Encouraged by the Aetolian League and their calls to liberate Greece from the Romans, the Seleucid king Antiochus III landed with his army at Demetrias, Thessaly in 192 BC, and was elected strategos by the Aetolians.; . However, Philip V of Macedon maintained his alliance with the Romans, along with the Achaean League, Rhodes, Pergamon, and Athens.; . The Romans defeated the Seleucids in the 191 BC Battle of Thermopylae as well as the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, forcing the Seleucids to pay a war indemnity, dismantle most of its navy, and abandon its claims to any territories north or west of the Taurus Mountains in the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC.; ; see also for further details. In 191‚Äì189 BC, Philip V, with Rome's acceptance, was able to capture some cities in central Greece that had been allied to Antiochus III, while Rhodes and Eumenes II () of Pergamon gained significantly larger territories in Asia Minor.; . A tetradrachm of Perseus of Macedon (); British Museum While becoming increasingly entangled in Greek affairs and failing to please all sides in various disputes, the Roman Senate decided in 184/183 BC to force Philip V to abandon the cities of Aenus and Maronea, since these were declared free cities in the Treaty of Apamea.; ; Bringmann dates this event of handing over Aenus and Maronea along the Thracian coast as 183 BC, while Eckstein dates it as 184 BC. It also assuaged the fears of Eumenes II that these Macedonian-held settlements would no longer threaten the security of his possessions in the Hellespont.; see also for further details. Perseus of Macedon () succeeded Philip V and executed his brother Demetrius, who had been favored by the Romans yet was charged by Perseus with high treason.; ; see also for a discussion about Perseus' actions during the early part of his reign. Perseus then attempted to form marriage alliances with Prusias II of Bithynia and Seleucus IV Philopator of the Seleucid Empire, along with renewed relations with Rhodes that greatly unsettled Eumenes II.; . Although Eumenes II attempted to undermine these diplomatic relationships, Perseus fostered an alliance with the Boeotian League, extended his authority into Illyria and Thrace, and in 174 BC, won the role of managing the Temple of Apollo at Delphi in the Amphictyonic Council.; ; . Eumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and delivered a speech to the Senate denouncing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Perseus.; . This convinced the Roman Senate to declare the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC), although Klaus Bringmann asserts that negotiations with Macedonia were completely ignored due to Rome's \\"political calculation\\" that the Macedonian kingdom had to be destroyed in order to ensure the elimination of the \\"supposed source of all the difficulties which Rome was having in the Greek world\\".; see also , who says that \\"Rome ... as the sole remaining superpower ... would not accept Macedonia as a peer competitor or equal.\\" Although Perseus' forces were victorious against the Romans at the Battle of Callinicus in 171 BC, the Macedonian army was defeated at the Battle of Pydna in June 168 BC.; ; ; . Perseus fled to Samothrace but surrendered shortly afterwards, was brought to Rome for the triumph of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, and placed under house arrest at Alba Fucens where he died in 166 BC.; ; ; see also for further details. The Romans formally disestablished the Macedonian monarchy by installing four separate allied republics in its stead, their capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia.; ; ; see also for further details. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many social and economic interactions between the inhabitants of these respective republics, including the banning of marriages between them and the (temporary) prohibition on the use of Macedonia's gold and silver mines. However, a certain Andriscus claiming Antigonid descent rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Iuventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150‚Äì148 BC).; . Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148 BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom.; ; . This was followed in 146 BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.; ; .

Development While recovering from injuries occurred during his professional basketball career in the 2010/2011 season, Behdad Sami decided to pursue his dream of creating a video game. Behdad Sami Interactive's first game, Get 'Em officially started production in 2011. It was planned to take a total of 6 months to produce, but due to numerous unfortunate setbacks, production took an extra 5 years. Get 'Em was finally released in summer of 2016 for the iOS platform and fall of 2016 for Android. Get 'Em was inspired by the open world free-roaming games Grand Theft Auto and Need For Speed Underground. The name comes from the term most dog owners use to tell their dog to fetch or \\"get\\" something. The concept of the game was to bring crime-fighting dogs into the spotlight, instead of being in a sidekick role. Behdad wanted users to play as superhero vigilante dogs in an open world environment, to give the users a sense of freedom as a dog in a big city. The art style created by SuperGenius Studios was designed to look like a cel-shaded 3D cartoon or comic book playable video game. Graphic novel On October 19, 2017, the first Get 'Em children's graphic novel, based on the Get 'Em video game, was released on iBooks. Stickers app On June 21, 2018, Behdad Sami Interactive released the Get 'Em iMessage stickers app. The stickers app has artwork from the actual video game and graphic novel iBook.

A specialist in liturgical music and a conservative Catholic of ultramontane and royalist leanings, he was a close friend of both Berlioz and Liszt. His most influential work was Dictionnaire liturgique, historique, et theorique de plain-chant et le musique d'√©glise, but he also wrote for many of the most prominent periodicals of the day, including Journal des d√©bats and Le M√©nestrel where he was the editor-in-chief from 1863 until his sudden death at the age of 64.Chouquet, Gustave (1900). \\"Ortigue, Joseph Louis D'\\", Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. 2, p. 614.

Early life D'Ortigue was born in Cavaillon, the son of Jacques and Marie Marguerite (n√©e Gaussen) d'Ortigue. His father was a justice of the peace and former army officer who had been educated at the Oratorian college in Tournon. The d'Ortigue family had lived in Provence for nearly six centuries, serving as magistrates, notaries, and legislators. Many other members had served as Catholic clergy or nuns. Five of the twelve brothers and sisters of d'Ortigue's grandfather, Henri Francois Xavier, had entered religious orders (two Carmelites, two Jesuits and one Bernardin). D'Ortigue received his earliest music education in Cavaillon, studying piano, violin and organ with his mother's cousin Henri S√©bastien Blaze and Blaze's son Castil-Blaze. Later, his parents sent him to Aix-en- Provence to be educated in the humanities by the Jesuits, and then, acceding to their wishes, he enrolled in the Faculty of Law at the Universit√© d'Aix. However, during his time at the university he also continued his study of the violin and took part in concerts at amateur salons and the Aix Cathedral.Lacroix, Sylvia L'√âcuyer (ed.) (2003).

First steps as a writer After finishing his law studies in 1827, d'Ortigue went to Paris to serve his internship. However, he soon became involved in the musical and literary life of the city, and in 1827 the journal M√©morial Catholique published his first piece of music criticism. He took up an appointment in Apt as a juge auditeur in 1828, but after a few months made the decision to abandon a legal career for a literary one. He returned to Paris in 1829, continued writing for M√©morial Catholique, and produced his first pamphlet, De la Guerre des dilettanti. The pamphlet which was critical of Rossini's influence on France's operatic and artistic life in general caused a considerable stir. Long an admirer of the Catholic priest and philosopher Felicit√© de Lamennais, d'Ortigue sent him a copy of De la Guerre des dilettanti. Lamennais invited him to work and study at La Ch√™naie, his house in Brittany. During his six months at La Ch√™naie d'Ortigue immersed himself in Lamennais's extensive library, became acquainted with the German philosophers, and researched the music of the ancient Greeks and Romans. He would later help Lamennais write the sections on music in his Esquisse d'une philosophie.Lacroix, Sylvia L'√âcuyer (April 1982). \\"Joseph d'Ortigue et la linguistique de la musique\\". √âtudes litt√©raires, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 11‚Äì31.

Frontispiece by C√©lestin Nanteuil for d'Ortigue's book Le balcon de l'op√©ra D'Ortigue returned to Paris in July 1830 when the city was in the midst of the 1830 Revolution. He became a founding editor of the short-lived journal L'Avenir which was established by Lamennais in 1830 to espouse his Liberal Catholic philosophy. D'Ortigue also wrote for several other journals including Le Correspondant, Le Courrier de l'Europe, La Quotidienne, Gazette musicale de Paris, and Revue de Paris. In 1833 he published Le Balcon de l'Op√©ra, a collection of his music criticism, and the following year a two-volume novel, La Sainte-Baume. Partially autobiographical, La Sainte-Baume recounts the pilgrimage of two artists to Sainte-Baume and expresses many of the philosophical and aesthetic views, especially those concerning music, that would mark d'Ortigue's work. During this time he also established close friendships with Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz and wrote the first serious biographies the composers. His biography of Berlioz was published in Revue de Paris in 1832. His biography of Liszt was published in Gazette musicale de Paris in 1835. It was d'Ortigue who arranged for Liszt, who shared many of his views on Catholicism and the role of the artist in society, to meet Abb√© Lammenais in 1834. Both Liszt and d'Ortigue were also among the earliest champions of Berlioz's music.\\"R.P.\\" (1834). \\"Roman et musique. La Sainte- Baume, par M. J. d'Ortigue.\\". Revue de Paris, Vol. 2, pp. 60‚Äì68 Mature years In February 1835 d'Ortigue married Fanny (Suzanne Fran√ßoise) Fran√ßois at Issy-les-Moulineaux where d'Ortigue was living at the time. Two of the couple's three children, Marie and Jacques, were born there. In 1840 they moved to a town house in Paris on the Rue Saint-Lazare where d'Ortigue would live for the rest of his life and where their youngest child, Jeanne, was born in 1843. From the late 1830s d'Ortigue took on a variety of posts in addition to his music journalism. In 1837 he was hired to catalogue the medieval music manuscripts in the Royal Library and in 1839 he was appointed professor of choral singing at the Lyc√©e Henri-IV. During this time he was also involved in organ manufacturing and sales and published articles on the history of the organ. It was an interest he would maintain throughout his life, later advising Berlioz, who was a musical instrument judge at the 1851 Great Exhibition, on the merits of French organs and composing some pieces of organ music himself. His reaction to the treatment of Berlioz's opera Benvenuto Cellini by the Paris Opera, the public, and most music critics led to his publication of a 350-page work, De l'√âcole musicale italienne et de l'administration de l'Acad√©mie royale de musique, √† l'occasion de l'op√©ra de M. H. Berlioz, in which he strongly defended Berlioz. Three years later d'Ortigue was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.Murphy, Kerry (January 2006). \\"Review: Joseph d‚ÄôOrtigue: √âcrits sur la musique 1827‚Äì1846\\".

Gazette musicale de Paris (11 June 1843). \\"Nouvelles\\", 10e Ann√©e, No 24, p. 204 In 1852 d'Ortigue published the work which cemented his reputation as a musicologist‚ÄîDictionnaire liturgique, historique et th√©orique de plain-chant et le musique d'√©glise. This dictionary of plain chant and liturgical music was over a thousand pages long and fifteen years in the writing. In 1857 he collaborated with Louis Niedermeyer in the founding of La Ma√Ætrise, a journal devoted to church music which published many of Niedermeyer's works. They also co-wrote Trait√© th√©orique et pratique de l'accompagnement du Plain-Chant, a treatise on the theory and practice of plain chant accompaniment published in 1856. After the demise of La Ma√Ætrise, d'Ortigue and founded the Journal des Ma√Ætrises in 1862. This periodical was short-lived and reflected d'Ortigue's increasingly conservative principles concerning in sacred music. Throughout this time, he continued writing as a music critic for multiple French periodicals and in 1861 published La musique √† l'√©glise, an anthology of those reviews and articles which pertained to sacred music. The last three years of d'Ortigue's life found his influence and authority on musical matters at their height. In 1863, he took over from Berlioz as the chief music critic of Journal des d√©bats and became the editor-in-chief of Le M√©nestrel. He was invited to judge international competitions, sat on various government commissions, and became a member of the music academies of both German and Italy. D'Ortigue died suddenly of a stroke on 20 November 1866. He was 64. Armand de Pontmartin wrote in one the many obituaries lamenting his early death that d'Ortigue had died in the fullness of his intellectual powers and at the climax of his career, surrounded by a brilliant group of younger musicians and critics who looked to him for guidance. After d'Ortigue's funeral at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, he was buried in Montmartre Cemetery. The eulogy at his graveside was given by Auguste L√©o, a young editor at the Journal des d√©bats who also read out passages from the journal's tribute to d'Ortigue written by Silvestre de Sacy.

Willamette River  The Willamette River runs through a large stretch of Oregon's Willamette Valley, with the main stem river stretching from south of Eugene to Portland, Oregon. Along its 187 plus miles, the river is impacted by a range of issues, from toxic pollutants and dams on the river's tributaries, to urban development and industrial waste. In addition to pollution, the habitat of the Willamette River was degraded to a significant extend. Overview Willamette Riverkeeper is the only organization that works solely to protect and restore the Willamette River's water quality and habitat. Over the years they have advocated, educated, and worked in a hands- on manner to improve conditions along the Willamette - with the support of many members of the general public. From their work on Superfund in Portland Harbor since 1995, to their advocacy for the Willamette Greenway, they have moved the Willamette River's health forward in a way that no other organization, funder, or government entity has. History Travis Williams has led the organization since 2000 as Riverkeeper and Executive Director, and the team at WR has made significant strides related to fish passage at the dams on the Willamette River's tributaries, in order to restore naturally reproducing populations of Spring Chinook and Winter Steelhead in the system. In fact, in 2007, Willamette Riverkeeper filed a lawsuit against the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) that forced the Corps to complete the Biological Opinion of the Willamette, and to begin work to reduce their impact. This legal action by Willamette Riverkeeper resulted in a settlement completed in 2008 that forced the US Army Corps and others to move forward in a robust fashion to improve fish passage and to restore habitat. This small non profit has also been responsible for bringing thousands of people to the river to canoe, kayak, paddle board, and swim over the years. Their work on the Willamette Water Trail has drawn thousands to the Willamette. Their signature event, Paddle Oregon, brings hundreds of people to the river every August to canoe, kayak and paddle board. Each day participants learn about the river and its needs. This small non profit continues to have a huge impact with its combination of advocacy, education, hands-on work, and policy expertise. In 2009, the organization worked hard to reignite the Willamette River Greenway Program by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. This effort sought to improve the understanding and stewardship of thousands of acres of public land along the Willamette River. Over the next several years, Willamette Riverkeeper was the lead proponent of protecting existing Greenway Lands, expanding public understanding of the value of public land along the Willamette, and increasing these lands each and every year. In January 2017, after 16 years of work the Portland Harbor Superfund site's Record of Decision was completed. Willamette Riverkeeper worked tirelessly over the time to push the many responsible parties to take action in regard to the Cleanup, and to support the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) work to complete the Record of Decision. Finally, after much political opposition, the Record of Decision was finished, and represented a major improvement over the Draft Plan issued but the EPA in June 2016. Travis Williams, the Riverkeeper and Executive Director of the organization has helped to lead the process during that time. Willamette Riverkeeper has been the primary non profit organization that worked to analyze the technical aspects of the cleanup, education the general public about the issue, and had taken thousands of people on the river to see it and learn about its issues since 1996.

BYU is the largest religious university in North America and is the flagship institution of the educational system of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Historically, experiences for BYU students identifying as LGBTQIA+ have included being banned from enrolling due to their romantic attractions in the 60s, being required by school administration to undergo electroshock and vomit aversion therapies in the 70s, having nearly 80% of BYU students refusing to live with an openly homosexual person in a poll in the 90s, and a ban on coming out into the 2000s. In the contemporary environment there is a continued lack of LGBTQIA+ - specific resources on campus , BYU students are at risk of discipline and expulsion by the Honor Code Office for expressions of same-sex romantic feelings that go against the school's code of conduct such as same-sex dating, hugging, and kissing, for gender non-conforming dress, and students and faculty are banned from meeting together in a queer- straight alliance group on campus. Several LGBT rights organizations have criticized BYU's policies around queer students and The Princeton Review has regularly ranked BYU as one of the most LGBT-unfriendly schools in the United States. Although BYU policies specific to same-sex romantic expressions have existed since the 50s, the first explicit mention of homosexuality in the language of the school's code of conduct was not publicly published until the Fall of 2009, and the first LGBT-specific campus-wide event was held in April 2017. Despite this historical and current environment, LGBT individuals have continued to enroll in and attend BYU with many participating in unofficial LGBT BYU communities. Ban on gay students general authorities. Before 1959 there was little explicit mention of homosexuality by BYU administration, but by 1962 a ban on homosexual students was enacted, though not mentioned in the media or in literature provided to students. On 12 September 1962, apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Mark E. Peterson and BYU President Ernest L. Wilkinson agreed on a university policy that \\"no one will be admitted as a student ... whom we have convincing evidence is a homosexual.\\" They agreed to share information about individuals cases of homosexual members between general church administration and BYU administration. This policy was reiterated in Wilkinson's address to BYU in September 1965 when he stated \\"we [do not] intend to admit to this campus any homosexuals. ... [I]f any of you have this tendency, ... may I suggest you leave the University immediately .... We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence.\\" The next month general authorities again stated that the \\"University does not permit any known homosexual to enter or remain at BYU\\", though they decided \\"for the purposes of admission or retention at BYU\\" that masturbation (or \\"self abuse\\") was \\"not considered homosexuality.\\" This decision forbidding the enrollment of homosexuals at BYU was again repeated in meetings on 27 January 1966 and 25 January 1968 and was codified in the 1967 version of the Honor code. The approved version read \\"homosexuality will not be tolerated\\", while the proposed sentence banning \\"masturbation\\" was removed in committee. The complete ban on any students with a homosexual orientation was softened a decade later by Wilkinson's successor, Dallin H. Oaks, in a 19 April 1973 Board of Trustees meeting. There it was decided BYU would allow students who had repented of homosexual acts and forsaken them for a lengthy period of time. Additionally, students guilty of infrequent sexual behavior (not including fornication or adultery equivalents) who were repentant and showed evidence that the act(s) would not be repeated would be admitted while overt and active homosexuals would still be barred from remaining and enrollment. Surveillance BYU bans extramarital sexual activity for straight students and further forbids any same-sex dating or physical expression of attraction including hugs for students identifying as LGBTQIA+. Under Oaks, a system of surveillance and searches of dorms of problem students, including suspected homosexuals, was implemented. This included electronic recording devices which BYU Security Chief Robert Kelshaw confirmed in 1975 had been planted on students to gather information. In reference to the widespread campaign to find homosexuals among BYU students, Oaks stated, \\"Two influences we wish to exclude from the BYU community are active homosexuals and drug users, and these subjects are therefore among those with which our security force is concerned.\\" Four years later BYU's newspaper reported Oaks asking BYU security to be \\"especially watchful\\" for any student homosexual infractions. Stake outs by BYU security looking for license plates of BYU students at gay bars in Salt Lake City and fake contact advertisements were placed in a gay Salt Lake City newspaper to ensnare gay students resulting in the arrest of former BYU student David Chipman. However, the director of public relations for the university stated that by 1979 Oaks ordered BYU security to stop surveilling gay bars and to cease posting entrapment advertisements. Values Institute In September 1976 top church leaders on the BYU Board of Trustees approved BYU president Dallin H. Oaks's Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior dedicated most heavily to search for evidence supporting church views on homosexuality. The primary assignment was writing a church-funded book on homosexuality to be published by a non-church source (in order to boost the book's scientific credibility). BYU psychologist Allen Bergin acted as the director, and book author. Institute member and church Social Services director Victor Brown Jr. wrote, \\"Our basic theme is that truth lies with the scriptures and prophets, not with secular data or debate.\\" Several dissertations were produced by the Values Institute before it closed in 1985. On July 13, 2020 former director Allen Bergin published an apology for promoting these views of homosexuality during his professional career. Payne Papers In 1977, gay BYU student Cloy Jenkins and gay BYU instructor Lee Williams Text reprinted at affirmation.org coauthored an open letter to refute the anti-gay teachings of BYU professor Reed Payne. The anonymous letter was later published with the help of Lee's gay brother Jeff and Ricks College faculty member Howard Salisbury as the \\"Payne Papers\\" pamphlet (later titled \\"Prologue\\"). This was anonymously mailed to all high-ranking LDS leaders and most BYU and Ricks College faculty causing a controversy. This elicited a response from apostle Boyd K. Packer in the form of his \\"To the One\\" 1978 BYU address on homosexuality Text reprinted at affirmation.org and an article from the recently formed BYU Values Institute. Policies and punishments in the 1990s and early 2000s A gay pride parody of the \\"Y\\" logo In the late 1990s a reference to \\"homosexual conduct\\" was added to the BYU Honor Code. In 1997 Honor Code Office director Rush Sumpter stated that BYU forbids actions of verifiable, overt displays of homosexual affection, but does not punish attractions. One student stated she tried to pray her feelings away, and another said her parents sent her to BYU to straighten out her homosexual feelings. In 2000 a reported 13 students were kicked off campus when caught watching the TV series Queer As Folk. Also archived here. The next year two gay students (Matthew Grierson and Ricky Escoto) were expelled under accusations deemed \\"more probable than not\\" of hand-holding or kissing. The Associate Dean of Students Lane Fischer over the BYU Honor Code Office stated in a letter to those two students that it was \\"inappropriate\\" for a BYU student to \\"advocate for the [homosexual] lifestyle\\" by publishing material or participating in public demonstrations as well as advertising ones \\"same-sex preference in any public way\\" reinforcing the existing honor code ban on coming out for lesbian, gay, or bisexual students. He also required homosexual students facing discipline to refrain from same- sex \\"dating, holding hands, kissing, romantic touching, showering, clubbing, ets., as well as regular association with homosexual men.\\" Current policies A gay superhero parody of BYU's Brigham Young statue In 2007, BYU changed the honor code to read that stating one's sexual orientation was not an honor code issue while removing the phrase that \\"any behaviors that indicate homosexual conduct, including those not sexual in nature, are inappropriate and violate the Honor Code.\\" The change also clarified the policy on advocacy of LGBTQ rights or romantic relationships. Several students, including those identifying as LGBTQIA+, thought that the previous wording was confusing and unclear. While both homosexuals and heterosexuals must abide by the church's law of chastity (i.e. no sexual relations outside of marriage, no crude language, and no pornography), the Honor Code additionally prohibits all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings (e.g. dating, hugging, kissing). There is no similar restriction against expressing heterosexual feelings. The policy on homosexuality was not noted in an online version of the honor code available to students until the fall of 2009. Both this version and the 2010 versions contained a clause banning homosexual advocacy defined as \\"seeking to influence others to engage in homosexual behavior or promoting homosexual relations as being morally acceptable.\\" In early 2011, BYU quietly removed the clause prohibiting advocacy. =Policies around gender expression= As for gender diverse students, policies remain unclear, and a BYU spokesperson has only stated that \\"transgender students are handled on a case-by-case basis.\\" One openly transgender student has tried discussing policies with the Honor Code office, but they've ignored his emails. No publicly available BYU policy seems to be in place for students transitioning with hormone therapy, or for an observed-male-at-birth student expressing their gender identity as a woman through clothing, makeup, or long hair. However, faculty are instructed that a female with a shaved head, or a male with long nails, brightly dyed hair, or makeup would be violating the Honor Code and should be reported to the Honor Code Office. BYU LGBTQ student group USGA meeting in 2017 In 2010, a group called USGA (Understanding Sexuality, Gender, and Allyship), consisting of BYU students and other members of the Provo community, began meeting on campus to discuss issues relating to homosexuality and the LDS Church. However, by December 2012, USGA was told it could no longer hold meetings on BYU's campus and BYU continues to ban USGA from meeting on campus . BYU campus currently offers no official LGBT-specific resources. Research at BYU around LGBT topics Research has shown a consistent presence of LGBT students attending BYU. In 1950, 1961, and 1972 BYU Sociology professor Wilford E. Smith conducted a survey of thousands of Mormon students at several universities including many from the BYU sociology department as part of a larger survey. His data spanning over 20 years found that 10% of BYU men and 2% of BYU women indicated having had a \\"homosexual experience.\\" He also found that \\"the response of Mormons [at BYU] did not differ significantly from the response of Mormons in state universities.\\" An informal poll of students in 1991 by an independent BYU newspaper found that 5% of students identified their sexual orientation as gay (similar to the 4% estimate by a BYU counselor in 1979), and 22% of all students knew of a BYU student who was gay or lesbian. A copy of the article can be found in the BYU Library's Special Collections Department at UA 1236, Box 4, Folder 8 In 1997 a poll of over 400 BYU students found that 42% of students believed that even if a same-sex attracted person keeps the honor code they should not be allowed to attend BYU and nearly 80% said they would not live with a roommate attracted to people of the same sex. In 2003 BYU's newspaper cited two LDS therapists who stated that \\"somewhere around 4 to 5 percent\\" of BYU students are gay. A BYU Spring 2017 survey taken by 42% of students found that .2% of the 12,602 who completed the survey (or 25 responders) reported their gender identity being transgender or something other than cisgender male or female. For comparison, a 2017 meta- analysis of 20 separate large surveys (with sample sizes ranging from over 30,000 US adults to over 165,000 each) found a conservative estimate of .39% for the portion of US adults who self-identify as transgender.  Aversion therapy at BYU  BYU's Honor Code office required some students reported for homosexual behavior to undergo electroshock and vomit aversion therapies in the 1970s Shortly after the 21 May 1959 meeting of BYU president Ernest Wilkinson and apostles on the executive committee of the Church Board of Education discussing the \\"growing problem in our society of homosexuality\\" BYU began administering \\"aversion therapy\\" to \\"cure,\\" \\"repair,\\" or \\"reorient\\" homosexual feelings among Mormon males. The on-campus program lasted through the 60s and 70s, and faded out around 1983. BYU mental health counselors, LDS bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, general authorities, and the BYU Standards Office (equivalent to today's Honor Code Office) all referred young men to the BYU program. Because of religious considerations, on 22 September 1969 BYU administration decided to reduce the amount of the on- campus \\"electrical aversive therapy\\" used to treat (among other things) what was deemed \\"sexual deviancy\\", though, the program continued. From 1971 to 1980 BYU's president Dallin H. Oaks had Gerald J. Dye over the University Standards Office (renamed the Honor Code Office in 1991). Dye stated that during that decade part of the \\"set process\\" for homosexual BYU students referred to his office for \\"less serious\\" offenses was to require that they undergo some form of therapy to remain at BYU, and that in special cases this included \\"electroshock and vomiting aversion therapies.\\" In an independent BYU newspaper article two men describe their experience with the BYU Aversion therapy program during the early 1970s. After confessing to homosexual feelings they were referred to the BYU Counseling Center where the electroshock aversion therapy took place using pornographic pictures of males and females. Jon, one of the individuals, implied that the treatment was completely ineffective. The experiences match most reports which state that shock therapy was ineffective in changing sexual orientation. From 1975 to 1976 Max Ford McBride, a student at BYU, conducted electroshock aversion therapy on 17 men (with 14 completing the treatment) using a male arousal measuring device placed around the penis and electrodes on the bicep. He published a dissertation on the use of electrical aversive techniques to treat ego-dystonic homosexuality. The thesis documents the use of \\"Electrical Aversion Therapy\\" on 14 homosexual men using a \\"phallometric\\" apparatus, \\"barely tolerable\\" shocks, and \\"nude male visual-cue stimuli.\\" Although it is not publicly published whether all top LDS Church leaders were aware of the electroshock aversion therapy program, it is known that apostles Spencer W Kimball, Mark E. Peterson, and now apostle Dallin H. Oaks were, and leaders involved in LDS Social Services thought the therapy was effective. At the time, homosexuality was considered by the medical community as a psychiatric condition, and aversion therapy was one of the more common methods used to try to change it. In 1966, Martin Seligman had conducted a study at the University of Pennsylvania that demonstrated positive results, which led to \\"a great burst of enthusiasm about changing homosexuality [that] swept over the therapeutic community.\\" After flaws were demonstrated in Seligman's experiments, aversion therapy fell out of popularity, and in 1994 the American Medical Association issued a report that stated \\"aversion therapy is no longer recommended for gay men and lesbians.\\" Participant in the 1975-76 BYU study Don Harryman wrote that he experienced \\"burns on [his] arms and ... emotional trauma.\\" Another participant, John Clarence Cameron, who wrote a play called \\"14\\" about his experiences, said \\"it didn‚Äôt change anything except increase my self-loathing. I didn‚Äôt know the ramifications of the experiment until years later.\\" Cameron stated that he \\"would like everyone to tell the truth, admit the mistakes that took place, and stop trying to act like it didn't happen\\" Another one of the test subjects described his experiences, stating \\"No one wanted to change more than I did. I did everything within my power to change, and it didn't alter my homosexuality one whit. All I had learned to do was suppress much of my personality ... I was shutting down, turning off.... I was making my life miserable by a pervasive denial of who I am.\\" Additionally, Connell O'Donovan describes the attempts by the University to 'cure' his homosexuality through vomit-inducing aversion therapy as well as electroshock aversion therapy. Val Mansfield and Drew Staffanson also describe undergoing aversion therapy and Raymond King describes his involvement as an intern with the BYU psychology department's electroshock aversion therapy program in the 1996 short documentary Legacies. The documentary 8: The Mormon Proposition also contains an interview wherein Bruce Barton states that BYU coerced him into vomit aversion therapy, as well as electroshock therapy, which later precipitated his suicide attempt. Jayce Cox also reported his experience with BYU shock therapy and suicidal ideation in articles and an MTV documentary. Reprinted here. Scott Burton discusses the burn marks on his wrists he developed when undergoing electroshock therapy from ages 13 to 15 at the hands of a Mormon therapist by request from his Mormon parents. In 2011 BYU admitted to the past use of electroshock therapy but denies that it had ever used vomit-inducing therapy \\"in the BYU Counseling Center\\" (which has been in the Wilkinson Student Center since 1964). However, the students that underwent the treatment have stated that the vomit therapy took place in the basement of the Psychology department's Joseph F. Smith Family Living Center (built in 1957, demolished in 2002).  Conversion therapy at BYU  Church leaders taught for decades that members could and should try to \\"turn off\\" gay attractions through means including conversion therapy. A 2011 Broadway play satirized these teachings with an LDS missionary character stating that he could \\"turn it off like a light switch\\" in reference to his gay feelings. In 2016, the church's official website declared that conversion therapy or sexual orientation change efforts are \\"unethical.\\" Prior to this change in stance BYU ecclesiastical leaders and Honor Code office administrators have encouraged or required students with homosexual feelings to undergo conversion therapy (also known as sexual orientation change efforts), sometimes under threat of expulsion. This therapy focused on diminishing same-sex romantic attraction sometimes happened on campus by church-employed therapists. For example, National Geographic journalist Andrew Evans has discussed the compulsory year of conversion therapy and \\"traumatic moments\\" BYU made him undergo in the late 90s as a student after he was caught kissing a man by his roommate. BYU told him he could be expelled or visit weekly with his bishop, turn in fellow gay students, cut off contact with any gay friends, and have frequent visits with a BYU therapist until he was heterosexual and \\"safe\\" for other students to be around. Included in the therapy was weekly dates with women as an additional attempt to change his attractions. Similarly, LGBT activist Michael Ferguson also discussed the many years and different modalities of expensive conversion therapy he underwent (including with a BYU psychologist) starting with a 2004 recommendation from his BYU bishop. He was told by local church leaders that many had \\"overcome\\" and diminished their same-sex romantic feelings and their \\"addiction\\" to those of the same sex. Ferguson believed that through this he could follow church teachings and marry a woman and enter the highest degree of glory in the afterlife. Much of the therapy focused on repairing alleged emotional damage from things deemed to cause homosexuality like an overbearing mother, distant father, and rejection from same-sex peers. Timeline of BYU LGBT History A timeline of events, publications, people, and speeches at the intersection of LGBT topics and BYU. Before 1959 there was little explicit mention of homosexuality by BYU administration. =1940s= * 1948 ‚Äì Gay BYU students Kent Goodridge Taylor and Richard Snow who were in love went to visit with church president George Albert Smith who told them to \\"live their lives as best they could\\" in their companionship. Smith wrote the words \\"Homo Sexual\\" in his appointment book. Earl Kofoed who went to BYU from 1946 to 1948 similarly reported a \\"live and let live\\" attitude of leaders towards LGBT Mormons, and described a thriving gay community of friends at BYU. He stated that there were no witch hunts, excommunications, or pressure to change ones sexual orientation at BYU like there would be in later decades. =1950s= * 1959 ‚Äì BYU began their on-campus electroshock and vomit aversion therapy program for males experiencing same-sex sexual attractions. =1960s= Under BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson, any non-straight students were banned from attending the university. * 1962 ‚Äì The apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Mark E. Peterson told BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson that no student suspected of experiencing homosexual feelings should be allowed to attend BYU. * 1962 ‚Äì BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson stated in a speech to the student body that people with homosexual feelings would not be allowed to enroll or remain as students since they contaminate the campus. * 1963 ‚Äì Elouise Bell began teaching in the BYU English Department. Bell lived with and was in a long-term relationship with Provo High School teacher Margo E. LeVitre for many of her years at BYU, which she apparently kept secret from the university administration. In 2015, after her retirement, Bell married Nancy R Jefferis.http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/2017/10/in-memoriam-elouise- m-bell/ * 1964 ‚Äì Apostle Kimball addressed seminary and institute faculty in a July 10 speech on BYU campus titled \\"A Counselling Problem in the Church\\", in which he called homosexuality a \\"malady\\", \\"disease\\", and an \\"abominable and detestable crime against nature\\" that was \\"curable\\" by \\"self mastery.\\" He cited one lay bishop (a businessman by trade) assigned by the church to administer a \\"program of rehabilitation\\" through which there had been \\"numerous cures.\\" He said \\"the police, the courts, and the judges\\" had referred \\"many cases directly\\" to the church. * 1965 ‚Äì Kimball again addressed homosexuality in his January 5 BYU speech \\"Love vs. Lust.\\" He called it a \\"gross\\", \\"heinous\\", \\"obnoxious\\", \\"abominable\\" \\"vicious\\" sin. The text states that those with homosexual \\"desires and tendencies\\" could \\"correct\\" and \\"overcome\\" it \\"the same as if he had the urge toward petting or fornication or adultery\\", but that \\"the cure ... is like the cure for alcoholism, subject to continued vigilance.\\" In the speech he stated BYU \\"will never knowingly enroll ... nor tolerate ... anyone with these tendencies who fails to repent\\", and that it is a \\"damnable heresy\\" for a homosexual person to say \\"God made them that way.\\" He also states that sometimes masturbation is an introduction to homosexuality.. Transcript reprint with permission by the Mental Health Resource Foundation at mentalhealthlibrary.info. Note: References to homosexuality were removed in the reprinted version of the speech in the 1972 book compilation of Kimball's speeches \\"Faith Precedes the Miracle.\\" * 1965 ‚Äì Five suicides of gay male BYU students are reported in one year. * 1967 ‚Äì After a policy change allowing BYU bishops to share confidential information gained from the students during interviews with BYU administration took place, a dramatic rise in students suspected of homosexual activity was reported totaling 72 recorded by BYU administration by the end of August 1968. Security files were kept by BYU on students suspected of being gay and students were encouraged to spy on other students. * 1969 ‚Äì BYU alumnus and Mormon painter Trevor Southey joined BYU's faculty teaching art until he was fired in 1979. He had attended the university as a student from 1965‚Äì1969 and later divorced his wife and came out as gay in 1982. He died in 2015 at the age of 75. =1970s= * 1971 ‚Äì Jim Dabakis enrolled at BYU after serving an LDS mission, but left and came out at as gay at the age of 23. He was elected to the Utah State Senate in 2012. * 1971 ‚Äì Kenneth Mark Storer was a gay Mormon BYU graduate student. He would later become a pastor in the gay-friendly Metropolitan Community Church in Salt Lake, Boise, and Tacoma, and a leader in an AIDS-victim advocacy group in the 80s. * 1973 ‚Äì It was decided by the BYU Board of Trustees that the ban on people attracted to those of the same sex would be lifted and they could enroll at BYU with local church leadership permission as long as they were not sexually expressing their attractions. * 1973 ‚Äì BYU psychology professor Allen Bergin published an article in the July New Era portraying some homosexuals as \\"psychologically disturbed persons\\" who are \\"compulsively driven to frequent and sometimes bizarre acts.\\" He cited two clients with \\"compulsive or uncontrollable homosexuality\\" caused by intense fear for the opposite sex, a lack of social skills for male-female relationships, and seeking security exclusively from the same sex. Bergin discussed the behaviorist sexual orientation change efforts he used in an attempt to change their same-sex sexual behavior and attractions. Oaks instituted a system of surveillance to identify and expel or attempt to \\"cure\\" homosexual students in the '70s. * 1974 ‚Äì BYU president Oaks delivered a speech on campus in which he spoke in favor of keeping criminal punishment for \\"deviate sexual behavior\\" such as private, consensual, same-sex sexual activity. The speech was later printed by the university's press. * 1974 ‚Äì Church president Kimball addressed the BYU student body stating that sex reassignment surgeries were an appalling travesty. Alternative youtube.com and archive.org links. * 1975 ‚Äì As part of the ongoing BYU security homosexual entrapment campaigns, BYU security claimed that an agency director for the US Department of Social Services man was caught soliciting sex by tapping his feet in a bathroom stall next to an undercover officer while visiting the campus, but the man denied the charges and called the security sting harassment. BYU banned the man from campus after he refused to meet with campus officials. * 1976 ‚Äì The church-operated university BYU began a purge in January to expel homosexual students as part of president Oaks' widespread campaign to curtail the influence of homosexual people on campus. The purge including interrogations of fine arts and drama students and surveillance of Salt Lake City gay bars by BYU security. These activities were noted in the Salt Lake Tribune and the gay newspaper Advocate. * 1976 ‚Äì BYU music professor Carlyle Marsden completed suicide two days after being outed by an arrest for alleged homosexual activity. * 1976 ‚Äì A 20-year study by a BYU Sociology professor is published showing that 10% of BYU men and 2% of BYU women indicated having had a \\"homosexual experience.\\" In 1950, 1961, and 1972 Wilford E. Smith conducted a survey of thousands of Mormon students at several universities including many from the BYU sociology department as part of a larger survey. He found that \\"the response of Mormons [at BYU] did not differ significantly from the response of Mormons in state universities.\\" * 1977 ‚Äì After hearing anti-gay rhetoric from BYU professor Reed Payne, BYU student Cloy Jenkins and gay BYU instructor Lee Williams produced the Payne Papers (later called Prologue) outlining information and experiences in defense of homosexual Mormons. It was later anonymously mailed to all high-ranking church leaders. * 1977 Stephan Zakharias (formerly Stephen James Matthew Prince) and a group of other lesbian and gay Mormons and former-Mormons organized the first official LGBTQ Mormon group under the name Affirmation: Gay Mormons United on June 11 in Salt Lake City at the conference for the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights.. Packer's BYU speech on homosexuality. * 1978 ‚Äì The apostle Boyd K. Packer delivered a sermon at BYU on March 5 entitled \\"To the One\\", which went on to be published by the church as a pamphlet. Packer characterizes homosexual interaction as a perversion and presents the possibility that it had its roots in selfishness and could be cured with \\"unselfish thoughts, with unselfish acts.\\" He states that the church had not previously talked more about homosexuality because \\"some matters are best handled very privately\\" and \\"we can very foolishly cause things we are trying to prevent by talking too much about them.\\" Three text advertisements placed by BYU security in a gay Salt Lake City monthly newspaper in order to entrap gay students. * 1978 ‚Äì In November BYU Security began placing entrapment ads in a monthly Salt Lake City LGBT newspaper to ensnare BYU students. This resulted in the 1979 arrest of David Chipman, a former BYU student, who made a romantic advance after being taken on a drive by undercover BYU security agent David Neumann posing as a gay BYU student. Chipman's controversial conviction due to the security officers making an arrest outside their jurisdiction for an entrapment case went to the Utah State Supreme Court. * 1979 ‚Äì Under the guidance of BYU president Dallin H. Oaks, BYU security began campaigns to entrap any students participating in same-sex sexual behavior and purge them from the university. * 1979 ‚Äì BYU's newspaper published a series of articles in April quoting BYU and church leaders and gay students on homosexuality.

It became popular in 2017 after the United States Senate voted to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren's objections to confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made this remark in defense of the silencing, during his comments following the vote. The expression went viral as feminists posted it on social media with hashtag references to other women. Its meaning has expanded to refer more broadly to women's persistence in breaking barriers, despite being silenced or ignored.  Background  = Senate debate on confirmation of Jeff Sessions = On February 7, 2017, the U.S. Senate debated confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to become Attorney General. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts spoke against confirmation, criticizing his record on civil rights. Senator Warren quoted a statement from 1986 by former Senator Ted Kennedy regarding Senator Sessions' nomination to federal court judge, \\"'He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department, and he should withdraw his nomination and resign his position.'\\" Senator Warren said she \\"will stand with Senator Kennedy, and, like he did, I will cast my vote against the nomination of Senator Sessions.\\" Senator Warren continued by reading a letter that Coretta Scott King had written to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986: = Senate Rule XIX = Senator Daines Cuts Off Senator Warren's Speech on Attorney General Nominee Jeff Sessions (video) While Senator Warren was reading the letter from Mrs. King, Presiding Senate Chair Steve Daines of Montana interrupted her, reminding her of Senate Rule XIX, which prohibits ascribing \\"to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator\\". Senator Warren stated that she had said that only former Senator Kennedy had called Senator Sessions a disgrace, and she asked whether reading King's letter, which had been admitted into the Senate Record in 1986, was a violation of Senate Rules. Senator Daines again quoted Rule XIX. Senator Warren asked to continue reading Mrs. King's letter, and Senator Daines allowed her to do so. = McConnell's objection = Sen. McConnell Refuses to Let Sen. Warren Speak About Attorney General Nominee Sessions (video) While Senator Warren continued reading the letter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky interrupted, saying, \\"The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the chair.\\" Senator McConnell objected to a line from Ms. King's letter, \\"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens\\", which Senator Warren had quoted prior to the warning. Senator Warren said she was \\"surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate\\" and requested to continue. Senator Daines asked whether there was objection. Senator McConnell objected, and Senator Daines called for a vote, saying, \\"The senator will take her seat\\", preventing Senator Warren from continuing. The Senate voted to sustain McConnell's objection along party lines, 49‚Äì43, silencing Warren for the duration of the Sessions confirmation hearings. Thirty hours remained in the hearings, and Democrats objected to Senator Warren's silencing. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon subsequently read the letter from Coretta Scott King without objection. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey pointed out that the letter was already in the 1986 Congressional Record. = After the vote = \\"Nevertheless, she persisted\\", by Mitch McConnell, about Elizabeth Warren (video) Following the Senate ruling to silence Senator Warren, Senator McConnell said on the Senate floor:  Reactions  = Rallying cry = \\"Nevertheless she persisted\\" on a Rosie the Riveter T-shirt at San Francisco March for Truth Feminists and supporters of Senator Warren immediately adopted as a rallying cry the three-word sentence, \\"Nevertheless, she persisted.\\"Bruce, Mary. \\"Silencing the Senator ‚Äì GOP Rebukes Warren: Speech Goes Viral\\".

According to BuzzFeed, the quotation was shared on social media along with pictures of strong women \\"who refused to be silenced\\". Amy Wang of The Washington Post observed, CNN reported, \\"For Warren's supporters, it was a textbook case of mansplaining followed by males silencing a woman\\". On National Public Radio's All Things Considered, Scott Detrow said that \\"Nevertheless, she persisted\\" had become the new \\"nasty woman\\", which had become a rallying cry derived from Donald Trump's description of Hillary Clinton in 2016. Tattoo Megan Garber of The Atlantic wrote that \\"Nevertheless, she persisted\\" appeared on the internet next to \\"images not just of Warren and King, but also of Harriet Tubman, Malala Yousafzai, Beyonc√©, Emmeline Pankhurst, Gabby Giffords, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Princess Leia. It accompanied tags that celebrated #TheResistance\\". Hillary Clinton tweeted, \\"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. So must we all.\\" It also appeared on merchandise: Reebok produced tee shirts with the expression and gave the proceeds to the Women's March. Hoodies and mugs with the meme were also produced. Salon reported women getting tattoos of the three words, more than 100 women in Minneapolis alone. On June 7, 2017, Senator Warren tweeted support for Senator Kamala Harris using the \\"Nevertheless She Persisted\\" hashtag, after Harris was admonished for interrupting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during a hearing. In 2018, the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination against Women\\", intentionally referring to the \\"Nevertheless, she persisted\\" remark by Mitch McConnell. = Criticism = Others were less favorably inclined toward the expression and its application to Warren. Charlotte Allen of The Weekly Standard suggested that #Shepersisted was yet another tactic in the marketing of Warren as a possible presidential candidate, describing it as \\"Red meat for Warren's supporters, who promptly cried sexism and compared her to Rosa Parks in her refusal to move to the back of the bus, and also to Marie Curie, who never gave up on her quest to discover radium. Within hours entrepreneurs were grinding out 'Nevertheless, she persisted' T-shirts in every size and color\\". The incident was also discussed in the context of Senator Warren's possible presidential candidacy by the National Reviews David Harsanyi, who referred to Rule XIX as \\"an arbitrary, speech-inhibiting rule that should not be used\\". Stating that \\"it was unlikely any persuadable voter would have even heard about Warren's grandstanding if it weren't for the kerfuffle,\\" he suggested that the \\"fuss\\" (including popularity of the hashtags \\"#Shepersisted\\" and \\"#LetLizspeak\\") was indicative of a Democratic tendency to \\"rely heavily on the identity politics that have failed them for six years, if not longer\\". Also in the National Review, Alexandra Desanctis wrote that McConnell's remark was \\"inviting endless inappropriate comparisons between Warren and female political activists from around the world\\". Desanctis continued: Gretel Kaufman of The Christian Science Monitor noted that some Democrats used the hashtag #LetLizSpeak to call Senator McConnell's remarks sexist and that the video of Senator Warren reading the full letter was widely viewed on social media. Raising concerns that the incident was \\"an example of partisanship getting in the way of productive debate\\", Kaufman quoted Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, as saying, \\"All of us need to take stock and need to start thinking about the people on the other side of the aisle and need to start thinking about how we might bring each other together.\\" = Broader themes = People's Climate March (2017) Tax March attendee in San Francisco carrying a tote bag displaying the phrase Some observers posited non-political reasons for the meme's proliferation. According to Daniel Victor of The New York Times, \\"A broader theme‚Äîthat women are too commonly shushed or ignored‚Äîemerged on social media.\\" Victor also noted that \\"a man silencing a woman struck some as all too common\\", and \\"rang familiar with many women who had their own stories of being silenced.\\" The Atlantics Megan Garber wrote, \\"American culture tells women to be quiet‚Äîmany ways they are reminded that they would really be so much more pleasing if they would just smile a little more, or talk a little less, or work a little harder to be pliant and agreeable.\\" Further, she wrote, when Senator Warren was silenced, \\"many women, regardless of their politics or place ... felt that silencing, viscerally ... Because, regardless of their politics or place, those women have heard the same thing, or a version of it, many times before.\\" Heidi Stevens of the Chicago Tribune commented, \\"Three little words that women can draw on for decades to come, when something needs to be said and, darn it, we plan to say it. When we're being talked over in meetings. When we're fighting to be heard in male-dominated fields. When we're standing up for our values. When we're doing valuable work and people reduce us to our appearance.\\" Valerie Schultz wrote in America: the Jesuit Review of Faith & Culture, \\"It is a phrase we women embrace because persistence is what we do.\\" After describing stories of persistent women from the Gospels, she concluded:  Cultural references  *In March 2017, Chelsea Clinton announced she had written a picture book for children about 13 inspirational American women, titled She Persisted. Clinton's book was adapted into a musical by playwright Adam Tobin and composer Deborah Wicks La Puma that premiered at Bay Area Children's Theatre in February 2019.

She is known for her romantic, spiritually conscious folk-rock which blends British progressive rock and American pop influences and for her critically acclaimed album, On the Dying Breath of Wisdom. Career Born into a military family to a career U.S. Air Force father and an English mother, Krissy Ramsey grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, East Sussex, England, and South Florida, before her father (who was also a jazz drummer) retired and settled the family in his hometown of Chattanooga in September 1973. Falling in love with the American and British pop music of the 1960s and 1970s, Ramsey was classically trained, playing French horn, bass clarinet and trumpet in her junior high and high school bands, simultaneously making her first songwriting efforts while playing electric piano in a garage band in her early teens. After graduating from Hixson High School in 1979, she enlisted in the U.S. Army where she played a critical role in the re-activation of 2nd Chemical Battalion at Fort Hood, Texas. After completing her military service in 1982, and being further exposed to her major British folk-rock influences (Al Stewart, Renaissance, Sandy Denny, and Strawbs), Ramsey taught herself to play the guitar and honed her songwriting skills while performing in local bars and coffee shops. Following her graduation from her Master's program at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Ramsey began recording her debut album, On the Dying Breath of Wisdom, in 1997 while simultaneously developing her career as a mental health counselor. Produced and arranged by keyboardist/composer Joseph Akins, and engineered by Glass Hammer's Fred Schendel, the album features guest appearances by soprano, Unita, on backup vocals and former Legend guitarist Ed Holub. The music combines introspective lyrics, soulful melodies, and lush keyboards with a mix of folk, rock, pop, and classical elements reminiscent of the British art rock of the 1970s. Its ten songs comprise a musical portrait of Ramsey's spiritual evolution as reflected in her relationships and the historical events of the time, and \\"offers the timeless message that humankind has the power to realize its highest destiny by transcending age-old divisions and embracing the unity of all life.\\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/krissyramseymusic/about While recording on the album was completed in 2000, Ramsey's ensuing life challenges prevented its release until 2012, a year which coincided with the revival of her music career. As she prepares to record her second album, Ramsey's notoriety has continued to grow through a well-received series of live solo shows, as well as positive reviews in music blogs such as the Chattanooga Pulse., JamSphere, and Indie Band Guru. Ramsey is also an interfaith minister and pastor of Crossvine Church, a community ministry she founded in 2013.

He also supported the cooperation of European companies with Iranian partners after the signing of the Iran nuclear deal.  Early life  Alireza Nasiri was born in Iran and finished highschool in the city of Qazvin.Alireza Nasiri as general director of Educational Support Department for Veteran Students at University of Tehran.  Education  Nasiri graduated from Iran University of Science and Technology with a bachelor of Industrial Engineering in 1993 and began his profession as an industrial planner. In the 1990s the Iranian energy and engineering industry was just taking off, having to fill the vacuum left by the exit of companies such as Bechtel and withdrawal of American blue collar engineers from Iran such as Bell Engineers from the times of Richard Nixon, a large need for industrial engineers developed in Iran. Nasiri joined many others who studied at the University of Science and Technology by completing the Iranian Concours, the Iranian equivalent of the SAT. In 2000 he acquired a M.Sc in Executive Management from the Industrial Management Institute (IMI) of Iran in Tehran and started working as an executive manager specializing in industry and engineering. 192x192pxIn 2010 he gained a PhD in Management Science and Engineering from the Dalian University of Technology in China and became an academic instructor with extensive experience in management and various industrial planning.  Career  First workshops held in Iran on the launch and management of online degree programs in University of Tehran.Nasiri began his career as an industrial planner in 1993 by working on industrial design projects. Later by 1999 he moved towards consulting and management, using his knowledge of industry and management techniques to improve the internal policy of industrial companies in Iran. He had a full-time career at the University of Tehran and often consulted companies in various industries and was appointed to several board of directors in those companies. Nasiri was among others part of a push to start a commercial ICT sector in Iran. Since 1998 he worked as acting general manager in the University of Tehran Public Relations office until 1999, working as chief executive of the influential Tehran University Monthly Press (ŸÖÿßŸáŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ).

In 2002 he shifted departments and his full-time job at University of Tehran changed to the General Director of Educational Support Department for Veteran Students, shortened as Isargaran, in the University of Tehran. In 2003 he launched Iran's first online degree program based out of University of Tehran. In 2003 online degree programs were an unexplored subject in Iran and the Middle East, and Nasiri managed workshops on the launch and management of online degrees in Iran at the University of Tehran and the 1st National Exhibition on IT and launched the E-City project. In 2004 he became a member of board at Darya Bandar Shipping Lines Co. In the same year he exited the University of Tehran and started working full-time at the Ministry of Cooperatives as General Director of Planning and Development during the tenure of President Khatami. While serving as director of planning and development he was the acting vice minister in the absence of Bahman Salehi.  Commercializing Forestation in Iran  Commercial forest planted in Janat Shahr by Aras GED. 221x221px After exiting the Ministry of Cooperatives in 2005 he began a PhD course on Management Science and Engineering in China, Dalian. After completing his PhD in the city of Dalian he was impressed by Chinese city planning utilizing green spaces as both a decorative and commercial tool to fight pollution and soil damage in the coastal city of Dalian. He began a campaign to solve Iran's pollution, deforestation and green city planning problem using commercial forestation. The effort would be supported by a series of greenhouses which produced genetically modified trees in a dozen locations across Iran. During this campaign Aras Green Economic Dawn (), or Aras GED, was established to manage the commercialization of forestation in Iran and cut down on the import of paper into the country which amounted to a billion dollar industry in 2013. The campaign had many setbacks in areas outside of Tehran, but for the most part has succeeded in making artificial forests commercially viable and profitable for forest owners in Iran. By creating economic value for forests with modified trees land owners would be part of a countrywide push towards commercial forestation. Aras GED's commercial afforestation began in several large cities in Iran. Namely Tehran, Shiraz, Tabriz, Masshad, Bandar Abbas, Anzali and Ardebil. Artificial forests were also planted in less urban locations such as Janat Shahr. The genetically modified nature of the trees made them both heat and chill resistant which was important in Iran's diverse weather environment. However Aras GED came up with a solution that would solve Iran's forest and pollution problem with a single tree that could be planted in the cold hills of Ardebil and also the hot valleys of Sistan and Baluchestan. Depending on a variety of factors from the ground's red soil content to moisture, the Aras GED tree grows anywhere between 2 and 3 meters in the first 7 months of planting. Using experience gained in the first few years of the commercial forestation campaign in Iran, the company will start to provide a green environment warranty with every Aras GED tree sold across Iran in order to make commercial forestry in Iran more widespread.  Consulting in China  240x240px Nasiri consulted several Iranian companies doing business in China and several Chinese companies doing business in Iran. Among these companies was Shiraz Metro which purchased rolling stock from China National Railway Company and its subsidiary in Dalian, DLRC. under an investment and sales agreement with the municipal government of Fars. Nasiri represented the Shiraz Metro company in Dalian. Since 2016 Nasiri's consulting office is based out of the top floor of the SUNIR Co building. SUNIR Co is the 8th global private contractor for electricity transmission and distribution and is based in Tehran. Board of directors In 2000 he joined the board of directors at National Industrial Shoe Co. In 2004 he served as a member of the board of directors at Darya Bandar Shipping Lines Co.

Aware that the musical manuscripts represent the most precious items of his collection, in 1958, he allowed an inventory to be completed by Raymond Meylan,Meylan, Raymond, La collection Antonio Venturi, Montecatini Terme (Pistoia), Italie, in Fontes artis musicae, n. 5 (1958), Kassel, B√§renreiter, 1958, pp. 21-44. a musicologist and flautist from Switzerland, and who was Venturi's colleague in the summer season orchestra of the Giglio Theater in Lucca. When Venturi died in 1981, his daughter donated everything to the Public Library in Montecatini, which in 1989 carried out a complete cataloguing on the collection. In 2016, the musical manuscripts were restored thanks to a grant given by the Tuscan Region, and inserted in the OPAC for the Documentary Network of the Pistoia Province (Rete documentaria della provincia di Pistoia: REDOP) (Italian site) and National Library Service. For the on-line recataloguing, the Center of Tuscan Musical Documentation (Centro della Documentazione Musicale Toscana: CeDoMus) collaborated. Description The Collection consists of 399 musical manuscripts, originating from Buggiano, Pistoia and Florence, most of which date from the second half of the 1700s and include works of some internationally famous composers (Domenico Cimarosa, Giovanni Paisiello, Pasquale Anfossi, Giuseppe Sarti, Florian Gassmann, Giovanni Francesco Giuliani), and of many local musicians (such as Alessandro Felici, son of Bartolomeo Felici, Giuseppe Aloisi, Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, Vincenzo Panerai, Charles-Antoine Campion), which often represent the only examples that exist today. It also conserves theoretical works, such as Musico prattico by Giovanni Maria Bononcini, L'armonico pratico al cembalo by Francesco Gasparini, and the three notes, titled Combinazioni di registrature, Regole generali and Regole generali per la Messa, which was anonymous and conserved by the nobleman Pietro Sermolli of BuggianoPietro Sermolli of Buggiano was one of the first to acquire and produce the papers of the collection. on the correct recording of the organ during the performance of the eight ecclesiastic tones of the Latin mass. These examples represent one of the extremely few existing records dedicated to the established customs of the organ in the 1700s.Pineschi, Umberto, Una tabella settecentesca toscana di registrazioni organistiche, pdf published at the on-line Accademia Gherardeschi di Pistoia and in CeDoMus. (Italian sites and texts) Given the uniform dates of the works conserved in the collection (all of the manuscripts come from the second half of the 1700s in the area around Pistoia), the collection is an essential source for the reconstruction of the production and circulation of the musical culture in the Eighteenth Century. Expositions Music collected in the fondo have been exposed in an exhibition in 2016 prepared by Lucca's Institute of History (division of Montecatini and Monsummano), and in an on-line exhibit created in 2017 by the same institute and by Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany, published in the Movio platform as Note di Carta (Paper Music Notes).

The microbial biomass blocks the pathway of water in the pore space, forming a certain thickness of impermeable layer in soil, and it reduces the rate of infiltration of water remarkably. Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded infiltration at various field conditions such as artificial recharge ponds, percolation trench, irrigation channel, sewage treatment system and landfill liner. It also affects groundwater flow in aquifer, such as permeable reactive barrier and microbial enhanced oil recovery. In the situation where infiltration of water at appropriate rate is needed, bioclogging can be problematic and countermeasures such as regular drying of the system are taken. In some cases bioclogging can be utilized to make impermeable layer to minimize the rate of infiltration. General description =Change in permeability with time= Bioclogging is observed as the decrease of the infiltration rate. Decrease in the infiltration rate under ponded infiltration was observed in 1940s for studying the infiltration of artificial recharge pond and the water-spreading on agricultural soils. When soils are continuously submerged, permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity changes in 3 stages which was explained as follows. # Permeability decreases for 10 to 20 days possibly due to physical changes of the structure of the soil. # Permeability increases due to dissolving the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water. # Permeability decreases for 2 to 4 weeks due to disintegration of aggregates and biological clogging of soil pores with microbial cells and their synthesized products, slimes or polysaccharides. The 3 stages are not necessarily distinct in every field condition of bioclogging; when the second stage is not clear, permeability just continues to decrease. =Various types of clogging= The change in permeability with time is observed in various field situations. Depending on the field condition, there are various causes for the change in the hydraulic conductivity, summarized as follows. # Physical causes: Physical clogging by suspended solids or physical changes of soils such as disintegration of aggregate structure. Dissolving of the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water is physical cause for the increase of the hydraulic conductivity. # Chemical causes: Change in the electrolyte concentration or the sodium adsorption ratio in the aqueous phase, which causes dispersion and swelling of clay particles. # Biological causes: Usually bioclogging means the first of the following, while bioclogging in broader sense means all of the following. ## Bioclogging by microbial cell bodies (such as bacteria, algae and fungus) and their synthesized byproducts such as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) (also referred to as slime), which form biofilm or microcolony aggregation on soil particles are direct biological causes of the decrease in hydraulic conductivity. ## Entrapment of gas bubbles such as methane produced by methane producing microorganisms clog the soil pore and contributes in decreasing hydraulic conductivity. As gas is also microbial byproducts, it can also be considered to be bioclogging. ## Iron bacteria stimulates ferric oxyhydroxides deposition which may cause clogging of soil pores. This is an indirect biological cause of decrease in hydraulic conductivity. Field observation =Under ponded infiltration= Field problem and countermeasure Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded infiltration in such places as artificial recharge ponds and percolation trench. Reduction of infiltration rate due to bioclogging at the infiltrating surface reduces the efficiency of such systems. To minimize the bioclogging effects, pretreatment of the water to reduce suspended solids, nutrients, and organic carbon might be necessary. Regular drying of the system and physical removal of the clogging layer can also be effective countermeasures. Even operated cautiously in this way, bioclogging is still likely to occur because of microbiological growth at the infiltrating surface. Septic drain fields are also susceptible to bioclogging because nutrient rich wastewater flows continuously. The bioclogging material in the septic tank is sometimes called biomat. Pretreatment of water by filtration or reducing the load of the system could delay the failure of the system by bioclogging. Slow sand filter system also suffers from bioclogging. Besides the countermeasures mentioned above, cleaning or backwashing sand may be operated to remove biofilm and recover the permeability of sand. Bioclogging in rivers can impact aquifer recharge especially in dry regions where losing rivers are common. Benefit Bioclogging can have a positive effect in certain cases. For example, in the dairy waste stabilization ponds used for the treatment of dairy farm wastewater, bioclogging effectively seals up the bottom of the pond. Algae and bacteria may be inoculated to promote bioclogging in irrigation channel for seepage control. Bioclogging is also beneficial in landfill liner such as compacted clay liners. Clay liners are usually applied in landfill to minimize the pollution by landfill leachate to the surrounding soil environment. Hydraulic conductivity of clay liners become lower than the original value because of bioclogging caused by microorganism in the leachate and pore spaces in clay. Bioclogging is now being studied to be applied for geotechnical engineering. =In aquifer= Water withdrawal from well Bioclogging can be observed when water is withdrawn from aquifer (below groundwater table) through a water well. Over months and years of continued operation of water wells, they may show a gradual reduction in performance due to bioclogging or other clogging mechanisms. Bioremediation Biofilm formation is useful in bioremediation of biologically degradable groundwater pollution. Permeable reactive barrier is formed to contain the groundwater flow by bioclogging and also to degrade pollution by microbes. Contaminant flow should be carefully analyzed because preferential flow path in the barrier may reduce the efficiency of the remediation. Oil recovery In extraction of petroleum, a technique of enhanced oil recovery is implemented to increase the amount of oil to be extracted from an oil field. The injected water displaces the oil in the reservoir which is transported to recovery wells. As the reservoir is not uniform in permeability, injected water tends to go through high permeable zone, and does not go through the zone where oil remains. In this situation, bacterial profile modification technique, which injects bacteria into the high permeable zone to promote bioclogging can be employed. It is a type of microbial enhanced oil recovery.
