Under the name Taishi Zaō, she writes boys love and girls love manga while under Mikiyo Tsuda she writes comedy-shōjo manga. Her reasons for doing this mainly had to do with keeping the fact that she drew manga centered on homosexual relationships from her family but they eventually found out anyway. Many manga artists often adopt artistic personas for themselves in order to represent themselves in sections of their manga not attributed to the story, as in an author's note section. Mikiyo Tsuda's persona is that of a teddy bear wearing a red bow tie with a bell at its center. One of her friends, and also a fellow manga artist, is Eiki Eiki. They often co-author manga together, display their art together, and have autograph sessions together. Eiki Eiki has even been known to sometimes act as Taishi Zaō's manager.

Publication history The Scarecrow was created by writer Scott Edelman and artist Rico Rival and first appeared in Dead of Night #11 (August 1975). Gil Kane and Bernie Wrightson provided the cover art. Artist Bill Draut was to have drawn the first appearance of the Scarecrow but did not complete the assignment. The Scarecrow was originally scheduled to appear as a feature in Monsters Unleashed and Giant-Size Werewolf but both of those series were cancelled before the Scarecrow feature could appear. It was then rescheduled for Dead of Night and after that series was cancelled as well, the character was to have a self-titled Scarecrow series but it was not published. Edelman and artist Ruben Yandoc produced a follow-up story which appeared in Marvel Spotlight #26 (February 1976), and was eventually concluded by Bill Mantlo and Ron Wilson in Marvel Two-in-One #18 (August 1976). Many years later, he was brought back in the pages of Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #31 (July 1991) in which he took on the name \\"Straw Man\\" to differentiate himself from the costumed killer the Scarecrow. He subsequently appeared in issues #38 and #40 meeting Daredevil in the latter issue. The Scarecrow did not speak in his early appearances, but in his later appearances he did and he pretended to be a newscaster named \\"Skirra Corvus\\", Latin for \\"Scarecrow.\\" Fictional character biography The Scarecrow is an extra–dimensional magical entity, possibly a demon, which takes vengeance on its enemies. He lives inside a palimpsest painting of a laughing scarecrow purchased by Jess Duncan and opposes the centuries-old Cult of Kalumai. The Scarecrow battled demons at a police station to recover the Horn of Kalumai, which would have allowed Kalumai to travel to Earth. Kalumai later spread his influence through the painting into a man who was mutated into a fiery creature and then fought the Thing and the Scarecrow. The Straw Man was invited by the Dweller-in-Darkness to join the Fear Lords, but he betrayed them to Doctor Strange. During the Fear Itself storyline, the Straw Man fought against Nightmare's attempt to use the fear brought by the Serpent to become the King of Fear. Powers and abilities Straw Man possesses superhuman strength, plant and weather manipulation, the ability to command crows, the ability to create portals and induce fear in others. He is also invulnerable to anything except fire. Reception The Straw Man was ranked #30 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters.

It was created from the northern portion of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Rauracian Republic existed for just a few months. It was inaugurated on 17 December 1792 and absorbed into France on 23 March 1793. Twenty-two years later, in 1815, Basel and Bern divided the territory of the former republic between them. The name of the Republic was taken from the Latin name of an ancient Celtic tribe, the Raurici, who settled the southern part of the Upper Rhine. The Raurici were related to the Helvetii, whose name was later bestowed on another French client state, the Helvetic Republic. Chronology Following the proclamation in September 1792 of the French First Republic, unrest quickly spread in the lands of the Prince-Bishop of Basel, leading to the creation of \\"revolutionary committees\\". On 17 December 1792, the Rauracian Republic was proclaimed as the first \\"daughter republic\\" of revolutionary France. Following the successive collapses of two national assemblies, a third voted for incorporation into France, backed by a referendum believed to have been supported by French pressure and manipulation. This was achieved on 23 March 1793 with the creation of the French Department of Mont-Terrible which had its capital at Porrentruy. Administrative frontiers changed more than once in the ensuring two decades, but when the war finally came to an end, the territory of Mont-Terrible, previously the Rauracian Republic, was divided by the victorious powers at the Congress of Vienna between the cantons of Bern and Basel. Unlike other \\"daughter republics\\" of France, the Rauracian Republic seems never to have acquired a national flag. It did, however, adopt a coat of arms. In essence, this portrayed the old Lictors' Bundle which had been a favoured symbol of authority under the old Roman Republic and which still appears in the seal of the French state and on the cantonal shield of St. Gallen.

It was the last release by the group before they split up the following year. Striving for The Lazy Perfection was the group's third album (excluding the compilation Epicurean) and its mixture of musical styles was heavily at odds with the usual perception of Sarah Records as a twee pop label. With the assistance of long-serving producer Ian Carmichael (also a member of the dance music group One Dove), the group recorded an album which took in styles ranging from their traditional melancholy guitar pop to rock numbers with a harder edge, upbeat pop songs and dancefloor-friendly electronic music. As was usual for albums on Sarah Records, no singles were released from it, though the title track did appear on a split 7\\" on the Bring On Bull label. Although the 7\\" fades out early, it is otherwise the same version as appears on the album. The album was well received by critics but sold poorly at the time. It was reissued in 2005 with five bonus tracks.

It lived in Europe, Asia, and Africa, during the Miocene epoch. Characteristics With a maximum length of 1.50 m (5 ft), Percrocuta was much bigger than its modern relatives, but smaller than a female lion. Like the spotted hyena, Percrocuta had a robust skull and powerful jaws. Similar to modern hyenids, its hind legs were shorter than the front legs, resulting in a characteristic sloping back. Classification Percrocuta was introduced as a genus of Percrocutidae in 1938. Percrocuta's relation to the family Hyaenidae was debated until 1985, when Percrocuta, Dinocrocuta, Belbus, and Allohyaena were accepted as the four genera of Percrocutidae. More recent evidence, however, has shown that Belbus and Allohyaena at least, are not percrocutids. Fossil evidence P. abessalomi is known only from a skull, two mandibles, and two teeth. These fossils were all collected from the Belomechetskaja, Georgia area and date from the sixth mammal neogene (MN) zone. This species is the best known of the family Percrocutidae. P. miocenica is known from only a few mandibles, found in Yugoslavia and Turkey. These fossils also date from 6 MN.

It is used to identify the potential impact of a project on the environment. The system consists of a matrix with rows representing the various activities of the project, and columns representing the various environmental factors to be considered. The intersections are filled in to indicate the magnitude (from -10 to +10) and the importance (from 1 to 10) of the impact of each activity on each environmental factor. Measurements of magnitude and importance tend to be related, but do not necessarily directly correlate. Magnitude can be measured, in terms of how much area is affected by the development and how badly, but importance is a more subjective measurement. While a proposed development may have a large impact in terms of magnitude, the effects it causes may not actually significantly affect the environment as a whole. The example given by author Luna Leopold is of a stream that significantly alters the erosion patterns in a specific area, which will have a significant magnitude, but may not be important, provided the stream in question is swift moving and transports large amounts of soil anyway. In this case, an impact of significant magnitude may not actually be important to the environment in question.

History Finds of bronze rings imply a settlement in the area during the La Tène era. During the Roman Empire the area was an estate which supplied the nearby city of Aventicum. In the Middle Ages, Clavaleyres was under the lordship of the Münchenwiler Priory. In 1527 the town was acquired by Bern. From 1798 to 1807, the town belonged to the canton of Fribourg, before it was finally returned to the canton of Bern. There have been various attempts to merge the municipality with Münchenwiler, another exclave of the canton of Bern in the nearby area. The proposals have failed because of the opposition of the inhabitants. Geography Clavaleyres village and surrounding fields Clavaleyres has an area of .

He appeared in horror, war, action and science fiction movies, but is best remembered for his many westerns. Early years Cameron was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and grew up in New Jersey. He played on his high school basketball team and on a semi-professional football team. Despite those activities and others such as swimming and playing ice hockey, he couldn't join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police because he failed the physical examination.  Films  Cameron moved to Hollywood as a young man and started out as a stuntman and bit player for Paramount Pictures as well as a stand-in for Fred MacMurray.p. 33 Wise, Wyndham Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film University of Toronto Press, 200 His early films include Heritage of the Desert with Donald Woods and Russell Hayden, Rangers of Fortune with Fred MacMurray, North West Mounted Police and Henry Aldrich for President with Jimmy Lydon. He also played bit roles at Universal Pictures, including in If I Had My Way, starring Bing Crosby and Gloria Jean. He appeared in a horror film The Monster and the Girl and played Jesse James in The Remarkable Andrew for Paramount. In 1943, Cameron gained star status in action serials for Republic Pictures. As crime-busting federal agent Rex Bennett, Cameron battled enemy terrorists in 15 weekly episodes of G-Men vs. the Black Dragon. He was already working in another serial when audience reaction to Black Dragon made him a hit. Cameron was sufficiently popular for the studio to turn the new production into another Rex Bennett adventure, Secret Service in Darkest Africa, with Cameron again battling against Axis agents. When cowboy star Johnny Mack Brown left Universal Pictures for Monogram Pictures, Cameron replaced him as Universal's western series star. Tall and rugged, Cameron looked good in the saddle and was very popular. Universal soon gave him straight character roles in feature films, including Salome, Where She Danced and River Lady both co-starring fellow Canadian Yvonne De Carlo. During World War II Cameron played in Commandos Strike at Dawn and played a US Marine in Wake Island (1942) and Gung Ho! (1943). Universal reorganized as Universal-International and downsized its activities in 1947, leaving Cameron and other contract players unemployed. He was hired by Monogram Pictures for a long string of outdoor action pictures. In 1948, he starred in Panhandle (a movie with a script co-written by Blake Edwards) for Allied Artists. In 1949, Cameron appeared with Bonita Granville in the comedy film Strike It Rich. He then appeared in many westerns and other films for Republic Pictures including Santa Fe Passage (1955), and later The Gun Hawk (1963), Requiem for a Gunfighter (1965) and The Bounty Killer (1965). Cameron traveled to Europe in 1964 to play the lead in spaghetti westerns such as Bullets Don't Argue (1964) and Bullet in the Flesh (1965). He later appeared in such films as The Last Movie (1971), Evel Knievel (1971) and Psychic Killer (1975). Television Cameron starred in three syndicated television series: City Detective (1953–1955), State Trooper (1956–1959), and the Coronado 9 (1960–1961). In City Detective, Cameron appeared as the tough New York City police Lieutenant Bart Grant.Erickson, Hal (1989). Syndicated Television: The First Forty Years, 1947–1987. McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 22–23 In State Trooper, a 1950s-style western-themed crime drama, Cameron starred as Lieutenant Rod Blake of the Nevada State Police. In Coronado 9, set in the San Diego area, Cameron appeared as Dan Adams, a private detective. Hal Erickson, in his book, Syndicated Television: The First Forty Years, 1947–1987, cited Cameron's business sense in confining his work in TV series to syndication: \\"A canny businessman, Cameron knew that his City Detective residuals wouldn't have been as fat had a major television network been claiming a percentage of the action, and as a result the actor vowed to remain in syndication for the rest of his TV career. By 1960, Cameron was drawing over $200,000 per annum in residuals [from his three syndicated programs]...\\" Cameron himself guest starred in many westerns, including six appearances on NBC's Laramie, with John Smith and Robert Fuller. In \\"Drifter's Gold\\" (November 29, 1960), Cameron plays Tom Bedloe, an outlaw who has started the rumor of a nearby gold strike. When series lead Slim Sherman, played by John Smith, comes to Laramie to buy supplies, he finds the town nearly deserted and must pretend to be an outlaw to survive. Meanwhile, Bedloe is looking for Marcie Benson, the daughter he has never seen, played by Judi Meredith. Gregory Walcott plays Duke, Bedloe's partner in crime. In another Laramie episode, \\"Broken Honor\\" (April 9, 1963), Cameron and Peggy McCay portray Roy and Martha Halloran, a farm couple who stumbles upon $30,000 in money found inside a strong box on their property. The loot had been seized in a stagecoach heist and hidden away for later retrieval. Roy, who is bound to a wheelchair, insists on keeping the money until Jess Harper arrives amid grave danger to all of their lives from the bandits searching about for the missing money. One of the bandits is played by Don \\"Red\\" Barry, best remembered from the 1940 film Adventures of Red Ryder. Cameron also guest starred in the NBC's western Bonanza in 1966: he portrayed Curtis Wade in the two-part episode \\"Ride The Wind\\". Cameron guest starred in such dramatic series as Crossroads, in which he portrayed Dr. Ervin Seale in the 1956 episode \\"Deadly Fear.\\" He guest starred too on CBS's Perry Mason, with Raymond Burr, as defendant Grover Johnson in the 1963 episode, \\"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang.\\" He continued to work in motion pictures and television into the 1970s. He appeared in season 2 of James Garner's NBC detective series, The Rockford Files. Personal life In 1960, he divorced his wife and later married her mother. Hence his former director, William Witney, publicly acclaimed Cameron the bravest man that he had ever seen. In his later years, Cameron lived on Lake Lanier in northern Georgia. After an extended battle with cancer, Cameron died in a hospital in the nearby city of Gainesville in Hall County, fourteen days after his 73rd birthday. The location of his ashes is unknown. He was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Quote I got on a horse and that was my big mistake. I didn't even know how to ride a horse when I came to Los Angeles. Even after I did 400 episodes on three different detective series, \\"Coronado Nine\\", \\"City Detective\\" and \\"State Trooper\\", casting directors would say \\"Oh yes, Rod Cameron, the cowboy\\".http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/22/Actor- Rod-Cameron-dies/7923440917200/ Selected filmography *Heritage of the Desert (1939) - Cowhand (uncredited) *The Old Maid (1939) - Minor Role (scenes deleted) *If I Had My Way (1940) - Slim - Bridge Worker (uncredited) *Those Were the Days!

It served the area between San Jose, Los Gatos, and Palo Alto, comprising much of what is today known as \\"Silicon Valley\\". For much of its existence it was a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad. History The Peninsular Railway was incorporated in January 1906 as a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific in response to calls for an interurban line from San Francisco to San Jose. In addition to the line to Los Gatos, branches were also planned to extend to Alviso, Oakland and Lick Observatory. However, due to the Colorado River flood of 1905 (which created the Salton Sea), many of the rails to be used for this construction had to be rushed to the Imperial Valley to rebuild the Southern Pacific line between Los Angeles and Yuma, Arizona. Therefore, only the lines connecting San Jose, Palo Alto and Los Gatos were constructed, and interurban service did not exist between Palo Alto and San Mateo. Another attempt to complete this line came in the next decade, but construction was again delayed by a scarcity of steel rails, this time due to World War I. Before the Peninsular Railway had built any track or started running interurban operations, F.S. Granger and J.W. Rea, who owned the San Jose Los Gatos Interurban Company, sold their tracks to the Pin to avoid competing with a company backed by the Southern Pacific. The original Pin tracks were from several other already existing interurban companies, such as the Alum Rock Railway Company, the Peninsular Railroad, and the Santa Clara Interurban Railroad. Some of the Peninsular Railroad and Alum Rock Railway trackage in San Jose became owned by the San Jose Railroads and were never a part of the Peninsular Railway. The trackage that the Peninsular Railway built itself was the line to Los Gatos through Campbell, the line along Stevens Creek Road to Cupertino, the two lines along the Mayfield cutoff from Cupertino to Mayfield, and Cupertino to Los Gatos, the spur to Congress Springs from Saratoga, and part of the line to Alum Rock Park. All of the lines were replaced by bus service by the late 1930s. By 1931, the system was operating 34 streetcars on of track.Demoro (1986) p.202 Electric passenger service between San Jose and Palo Alto began on March 5, 1910 and ended on October 1, 1934.McCaleb (1981) p. 57 and p. 97 Route =San Jose= By 1920, the sixty-eight-mile system had several main tracks originating in San Jose. San Jose to Cupertino :Downtown to Monta Vista via Stevens Creek Road (now Stevens Creek Boulevard) San Jose to Los Gatos :via several county roads and San Jose-Los Gatos Road (now Bascom Avenue and Los Gatos Boulevard) San Jose to Los Gatos :via Saratoga-Santa Clara Road (now Saratoga Avenue) and Saratoga-Los Gatos Road Berryessa (North 10th Street and Madera Avenue) to Alum Rock Park :using dedicated right of way parallel to Berryessa Road and Penitencia Creek =Palo Alto= The Pin also operated several local lines in and near Palo Alto, California: Mayfield - Palo Alto :From what is today the California Avenue train station to the Palo Alto train station, primarily along El Camino Real Palo Alto - Stanford University :From the Palo Alto train depot to Stanford University over El Camino Real and a track leased from Stanford (This track was on the south side of Galvez st, and continued past the Stanford Stadium until Lasuen St, where it continued until turning west along Serra Mall and ending at the Palm Dr loop) Palo Alto - University Avenue :From the Palo Alto train depot to San Francisquito Creek along University Avenue Palo Alto - Waverley Street :From the Palo Alto train depot to Oregon Avenue along University Avenue and Waverley Street =Other Lines= Cupertino to Mayfield along current Union Pacific track and Foothill Expressway. (This route, the so-called \\"Mayfield cutoff\\", was also used by Southern Pacific starting in 1908 as part of its steam train passenger service between San Francisco and Santa Cruz.)McCaleb (1981) p. 52 Cupertino to Los Gatos From Monta Vista (Cupertino) to Vasona Junction (Now the junction of California State Route 85 and Winchester Boulevard) along current Union Pacific track Saratoga to Congress Springs A branch line from Saratoga-Santa Clara Road and Saratoga-Los Gatos Road to Congress Springs along Big Basin Road Peninsular Railway car 52 & 61 These cars are all that's left of the Peninsular Railway. Both 52 and 61 are currently at the Western Railway Museum, and were two of twelve wooden cars operating for the San Jose Los Gatos Interurban Company. They were renumbered when the Peninsular Railway took over. The 52 is still operational , and is used for tourist excursions. It was restored to operating condition after spending many years in a backyard being used as a sewing room. The 61 was a trailer car and is currently awaiting restoration.

The station was previously known as Interlaken Zollhaus. The town has one other station, Interlaken West. Interlaken Ost is an important railway junction at the meeting point of three railway lines, the Thunersee line of the BLS AG, the Brünig line of the Zentralbahn, and the Bernese Oberland railway (BOB). In addition to trains operated directly by the owners of these lines, the station is also reached by passenger trains of the Swiss Federal Railways, Deutsche Bahn, all of which operate over the Thunersee line. The station provides an interchange with the local bus network provided by PostBus Switzerland and the regional bus line to Thun provided by Verkehrsbetriebe STI. Ships of the BLS-owned fleet on Lake Brienz serve a quay at Interlaken Ost, which they access via a navigable reach of the Aar river.  History  A BOB train at Interlaken Ost, note the former brown / cream livery In 1872, the standard gauge Bödelibahn railway opened from Därligen, on Lake Thun, to Interlaken, as Interlaken West station was then known. Two years later it was extended to Bönigen, on Lake Brienz, via a new station that was at first known as Interlaken Zollhaus. Initially this line was unconnected to the rest of the Swiss railway system, and merely served as a link between the steamships on both lakes. In 1893, the line reached Thun, with onward connections to Bern and beyond, eventually becoming part of the BLS. In 1890, the metre gauge Berner Oberland railway opened, adopting Interlaken Zollhaus as the terminus of its route to the tourist destinations of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. As a consequence, Interlaken Zollhaus became more important, and was renamed Interlaken Ost. At the same time the original Interlaken station became Interlaken West. Meanwhile, in 1888, the metre gauge Brünig railway had opened between Brienz, on Lake Brienz, and Alpnachstad, on Lake Lucerne, thus providing a through steamer and rail connection from Interlaken to Lucerne. By 1916 the Brünig railway had reached Interlaken Ost from Brienz, and, together an earlier extension at its eastern end, provided a through rail route to Lucerne. Standard gauge passenger service between Interlaken Ost and Bönigen ceased in 1969, although much of the line still exists in order to provide access to the BLS workshops as described above.  Operation  The station seen from the east. The BOB line curves in from the left, serving the leftmost platforms. The Brünig line arrives from the right and serves the central platforms. The Thunersee line arrives from the far end of the station, and serves the rightmost platforms. The station looking east. The standard gauge Thunersee line platforms are nearest the camera, and run beyond the station into turnback sidings. To the right of this, the line to Bönigen can be seen curving rightwards. On the other side of the depot building, the metre gauge Brünig can be seen climbing and curving left, in order to pass over the Bönigen line and the Aar river. The BOB lines are out of shot to the right. The station seen from the west. The Thunersee line enters the station from behind the camera, serving the northernmost three platforms. To the right are a pair of platform tracks used by the Brünig line, and out of shot beyond them are the platforms used by the BOB. = Layout = The station is notable in that although lines converge on it from three directions, it is the terminus of every passenger service which enters it. There are no through services due to incompatibilities in gauge and electrical systems. The Thunersee line is standard gauge while the BOB and Brünig tracks are metre gauge. Additionally, there are two electrical systems; 1500 V DC for the BOB services and 15 kV AC for all the rest. The platforms used by the Brünig line and BOB are terminal platforms and no metre gauge track exists west of the station. Whilst no standard gauge passenger trains now run to the east of the station, that section of the station is configured for through traffic, and the tracks continue for about to the east in order to provide access to the BLS workshops at Bönigen. None of the eight platform tracks are dual-gauge or dual-system, from the south side of the station, where the station building is located, the first three platform tracks are used by the BOB, the next two by the Brünig line, and the final three by the Thunersee line. = Services = The following services call at Interlaken Ost: * EuroCity / InterCity / Intercity Express (ICE): half-hourly service to Basel SBB. Most northbound trains terminate in Basel; a single EuroCity continues to Hamburg-Altona and two ICEs continue to Berlin Ostbahnhof. * InterRegio: hourly service to Lucerne. * RegioExpress: four trains per day to Zweisimmen. * Regio: ** Zentralbahn: hourly service to Meiringen. ** BLS AG: hourly service to Spiez. ** Berner Oberland Bahn: half-hourly service to Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald; trains operate combined between Interlaken Ost and Zweilütschinen.

He was inoculated by close friends with blood which had been taken from a wart of a 14-year-old patient.Top 10 Researchers Who Experimented On Themselves; Top Tenz; accessed ??? Carrión's aim was to prove a link between the acute blood stage of Oroya fever with that of the later chronic form of the disease, called verruga peruana, typified by numerous red, wart-like dermal nodules. Neither the cause nor mode of transmission of Oroya fever was then known and, furthermore, the relationship between the acute and chronic forms of the disease was not yet proven. Carrión developed the classic symptoms of the acute phase of the disease, thereby establishing the link. After Carrión's death from the disease, a fellow student who had assisted in the experiment was arrested for his murder, but later released.Cutis, vol. 48, iss. 4-6, p. 339, 1991.

Measures in information theory  Many of the concepts in information theory have separate definitions and formulas for continuous and discrete cases. For example, entropy \\\\Eta(X) is usually defined for discrete random variables, whereas for continuous random variables the related concept of differential entropy, written h(X), is used (see Cover and Thomas, 2006, chapter 8). Both these concepts are mathematical expectations, but the expectation is defined with an integral for the continuous case, and a sum for the discrete case. These separate definitions can be more closely related in terms of measure theory. For discrete random variables, probability mass functions can be considered density functions with respect to the counting measure. Thinking of both the integral and the sum as integration on a measure space allows for a unified treatment. Consider the formula for the differential entropy of a continuous random variable X with range \\\\mathbb{R} and probability density function f(x): : h(X) = -\\\\int_\\\\mathbb{R} f(x) \\\\log f(x) \\\\,dx. This can usually be interpreted as the following Riemann–Stieltjes integral: : h(X) = -\\\\int_\\\\mathbb{R} f(x) \\\\log f(x) \\\\,d\\\\mu(x), where \\\\mu is the Lebesgue measure. If instead, X is discrete, with range \\\\Omega a finite set, f is a probability mass function on \\\\Omega, and u is the counting measure on \\\\Omega, we can write: : \\\\Eta(X) = -\\\\sum_{x\\\\in \\\\Omega} f(x) \\\\log f(x) = -\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) \\\\log f(x) \\\\,d u(x). The integral expression, and the general concept, are identical in the continuous case; the only difference is the measure used. In both cases the probability density function f is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the probability measure with respect to the measure against which the integral is taken. If P is the probability measure induced by X, then the integral can also be taken directly with respect to P : : h(X) = -\\\\int_X \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d P}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\mu} \\\\,dP, If instead of the underlying measure μ we take another probability measure Q , we are led to the Kullback–Leibler divergence: let P and Q be probability measures over the same space. Then if P is absolutely continuous with respect to Q, written P \\\\ll Q, the Radon–Nikodym derivative \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dP}{\\\\mathrm dQ} exists and the Kullback–Leibler divergence can be expressed in its full generality: :D_\\\\operatorname{KL}(P \\\\ Q) = \\\\int_{\\\\operatorname{supp}P} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dP}{\\\\mathrm dQ} \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dP}{\\\\mathrm dQ} \\\\,d Q = \\\\int_{\\\\operatorname{supp}P} \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dP}{\\\\mathrm dQ} \\\\,d P, where the integral runs over the support of P. Note that we have dropped the negative sign: the Kullback–Leibler divergence is always non-negative due to Gibbs' inequality. Entropy as a \\"measure\\" Venn diagram for various information measures associated with correlated variables X and Y. The area contained by both circles is the joint entropy H(X,Y). The circle on the left (red and cyan) is the individual entropy H(X), with the red being the conditional entropy H(XY). The circle on the right (blue and cyan) is H(Y), with the blue being H(YX). The cyan is the mutual information I(X;Y).Venn diagram of information theoretic measures for three variables x, y, and z. Each circle represents an individual entropy: H(x) is the lower left circle, H(y) the lower right, and H(z) is the upper circle. The intersections of any two circles represents the mutual information for the two associated variables (e.g. I(x;z) is yellow and gray). The union of any two circles is the joint entropy for the two associated variables (e.g. H(x,y) is everything but green). The joint entropy H(x,y,z) of all three variables is the union of all three circles. It is partitioned into 7 pieces, red, blue, and green being the conditional entropies H(xy,z), H(yx,z), H(zx,y) respectively, yellow, magenta and cyan being the conditional mutual informations I(x;zy), I(y;zx) and I(x;yz) respectively, and gray being the multivariate mutual information I(x;y;z). The multivariate mutual information is the only one of all that may be negative. There is an analogy between Shannon's basic \\"measures\\" of the information content of random variables and a measure over sets. Namely the joint entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information can be considered as the measure of a set union, set difference, and set intersection, respectively (Reza pp. 106–108). If we associate the existence of abstract sets \\\\tilde X and \\\\tilde Y to arbitrary discrete random variables X and Y, somehow representing the information borne by X and Y, respectively, such that: * \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cap \\\\tilde Y) = 0 whenever X and Y are unconditionally independent, and * \\\\tilde X = \\\\tilde Y whenever X and Y are such that either one is completely determined by the other (i.e. by a bijection); where \\\\mu is a signed measure over these sets, and we set: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Eta(X) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Eta(Y) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde Y), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Eta(X,Y) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cup \\\\tilde Y), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Eta(X\\\\mid Y) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\setminus \\\\tilde Y), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{I}(X;Y) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cap \\\\tilde Y); \\\\end{align} we find that Shannon's \\"measure\\" of information content satisfies all the postulates and basic properties of a formal signed measure over sets, as commonly illustrated in an information diagram. This allows the sum of two measures to be written: : \\\\mu(A)+\\\\mu(B)=\\\\mu(A\\\\cup B)+\\\\mu(A\\\\cap B) and the analog of Bayes' theorem (\\\\mu(A)+\\\\mu(B\\\\setminus A)=\\\\mu(B)+\\\\mu(A\\\\setminus B)) allows the difference of two measures to be written: : \\\\mu(A)-\\\\mu(B)=\\\\mu(A\\\\setminus B)-\\\\mu(B\\\\setminus A) This can be a handy mnemonic device in some situations, e.g. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Eta(X,Y) & =\\\\Eta(X)+\\\\Eta(Y\\\\mid X) & \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cup \\\\tilde Y) & =\\\\mu(\\\\tilde X)+\\\\mu(\\\\tilde Y \\\\setminus \\\\tilde X) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{I}(X;Y) & =\\\\Eta(X)-\\\\Eta(X\\\\mid Y) & \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cap \\\\tilde Y) & =\\\\mu(\\\\tilde X)-\\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\setminus \\\\tilde Y) \\\\end{align} Note that measures (expectation values of the logarithm) of true probabilities are called \\"entropy\\" and generally represented by the letter H, while other measures are often referred to as \\"information\\" or \\"correlation\\" and generally represented by the letter I. For notational simplicity, the letter I is sometimes used for all measures. Multivariate mutual information Certain extensions to the definitions of Shannon's basic measures of information are necessary to deal with the σ-algebra generated by the sets that would be associated to three or more arbitrary random variables. (See Reza pp. 106–108 for an informal but rather complete discussion.) Namely \\\\Eta(X,Y,Z,\\\\cdots) needs to be defined in the obvious way as the entropy of a joint distribution, and a multivariate mutual information \\\\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z;\\\\cdots) defined in a suitable manner so that we can set: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Eta(X,Y,Z,\\\\cdots) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cup \\\\tilde Y \\\\cup \\\\tilde Z \\\\cup \\\\cdots), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z;\\\\cdots) & = \\\\mu(\\\\tilde X \\\\cap \\\\tilde Y \\\\cap \\\\tilde Z \\\\cap \\\\cdots); \\\\end{align} in order to define the (signed) measure over the whole σ-algebra. There is no single universally accepted definition for the mutivariate mutual information, but the one that corresponds here to the measure of a set intersection is due to Fano (1966: p. 57-59). The definition is recursive. As a base case the mutual information of a single random variable is defined to be its entropy: \\\\operatorname{I}(X)=\\\\Eta(X). Then for n\\\\geq 2 we set : \\\\operatorname{I}(X_1; \\\\cdots; X_n) = \\\\operatorname{I}(X_1; \\\\cdots; X_{n-1}) - \\\\operatorname{I}(X_1; \\\\cdots; X_{n-1}\\\\mid X_n), where the conditional mutual information is defined as : \\\\operatorname{I}(X_1; \\\\cdots; X_{n-1}\\\\mid X_n) = \\\\mathbb E_{X_n}\\\\big(\\\\operatorname{I}(X_1; \\\\cdots; X_{n-1})\\\\mid X_n\\\\big). The first step in the recursion yields Shannon's definition \\\\operatorname{I}(X_1;X_2)=\\\\Eta(X_1)-\\\\Eta(X_1\\\\mid X_2). The multivariate mutual information (same as interaction information but for a change in sign) of three or more random variables can be negative as well as positive: Let X and Y be two independent fair coin flips, and let Z be their exclusive or. Then \\\\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z) = - 1 bit. Many other variations are possible for three or more random variables: for example, \\\\operatorname{I}(X,Y;Z) is the mutual information of the joint distribution of X and Y relative to Z, and can be interpreted as \\\\mu((\\\\tilde X \\\\cup \\\\tilde Y) \\\\cap \\\\tilde Z). Many more complicated expressions can be built this way, and still have meaning, e.g. \\\\operatorname{I}(X,Y;Z\\\\mid W), or \\\\Eta(X,Z\\\\mid W,Y). References * Thomas M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas.

It is a asphalt oval owned and operated by Sue Clements and Patsy Stargardt. The track originally canceled the 2011 racing season after announcing that owner Sue Clements was battling health problems. However, a shortened 11-week 2011 season took place, which saw the return of the Legends and Pro Six divisions. History Southside Speedway, which used to be known as Royall Speedway and Wack-A-Mole Speedway in the early 1950s, first opened in 1949 and hosted midget races. The track was built by Nelson Royall, who leased the land from the Wilkerson family. It reopened on April 15, 1959 with Modifieds as the feature division. For a few years, it was used as a part of NASCAR's early circuit. The first NASCAR Cup Series race on Southside speedway happened on August 18, 1961. At that time, the track was a 1/4 mile dirt oval. At , Junior Johnson took the pole for the 150-lap race in his 1960 Pontiac. He led every lap of the race that took about 45 minutes to race. By the next year, Southside Speedway had become a 1/3 mile asphalt oval. At , Rex White took the pole, but would duck out on lap 134 with engine trouble, which would lead Jimmy Pardue to win the 200-lap feature in his 1962 Pontiac. Richard Petty would finish third in that race. Later that season, Rex White's bad luck would continue. After leading 276 laps of a 300 lap feature, he would lose his lead to Cliff Stewart, who would win the event in his 1962 Pontiac. The last main circuit race recorded at Southside Speedway was on May 19, 1963, in which Ned Jarrett would lead the most laps and win the 300-lap feature in his 1963 Ford. Since this time, Southside Speedway has been used to house several NASCAR syndicated feature series, in which the track has seen great names such as Darrell Waltrip and Bobby Allison turn left at the 1/3 mile track. Throughout the track's history, there has often been one or two single divisions that brought the fans to the track, and several other novelty divisions that have been used by drivers as a stepping stone to the more prominent divisions. Usually, the more prominent division has been any variety of late model cars or modifieds, and its immediate predecessor division has been the Grand Stock class, or something similar, such as Pure Stocks. During the 1970s, three names emerged that would plant the seed for future generations of competition at Southside Speedway. Ray Hendrick, Cal Johnson and Ted Hairfield were older drivers whose sons and grandsons have become competitive forces throughout the decades. =The Hendricks= Ray Hendrick raced his burgundy Modified car during the 1960s and 1970s, and quickly planted the seed for the Hendrick dynasty. In 1974 and 1975, he placed 8th and 9th respectively in the National Late Model Sportsman Points, which would later become known as the Busch Grand National Series. At Martinsville Speedway, Ray Hendrick is 1st in all-time wins after he won 20 collective races between 1963 and 1975. He sits atop this list of great drivers including Richard Petty and Geoff Bodine. Ray Hendrick is best known for his philosophy of racing anywhere and everywhere. He participated in 17 NASCAR Winston Cup races, of which he captured six career top fives. Cancer claimed Ray Hendrick's life on September 28, 1990. Later down the road, his son Roy Hendrick would enter the Late Model Stock Car division in a Pontiac whose paint scheme would become identical to his father's modified car. These cars were burgundy, whose white number 11 was encased in a white circle with a wing coming from the side. Roy Hendrick also made a name for himself and neighboring short tracks that feature Late Model-type racing including Langley Speedway in Hampton, Virginia and South Boston Speedway. Roy Hendrick dominated Southside Speedway for years, because of which he is commonly referred to as \\"Rapid\\" Roy Hendrick. Because of his and his father's reign at these tracks, the \\"Flying Eleven\\" logo has become as common among the Virginia short track circuit as Dale Earnhardt's number three has become an iconic symbol among the NASCAR circuit. Over the past few years, Roy's son, Brandon Hendrick has peeked his head into the Late Model Sportsman and Modified divisions. Brandon currently races the number 55 car in Southside Speedway's Late Model Sportsman division. Roy Hendrick currently races the number 39 car in the Late Model Sportsman division at Southside Speedway. Also Roy Hendrick has of late mentored a driver named Mark Simpson #36 driving a car in the Grand Stock division maintained by Roy and won in only his 6th race and has finished 2nd in points in 2009 and 3rd in 2010 and has numerous heat and feature wins and also won the 2008 Thanksgiving Classic at Southern National Speedway, in keeping with the Hendrick tradition. =The 1980s= During the mid to late 1980s, the three prominent divisions at Southside Speedway were the Late Model Stock Cars, Grand Stocks and Mini Stocks. The elite of Southside Speedway's limelight through the 1980s was shared by the rivalry between Wayne Patterson and Roy Hendrick, but Bugs Hairfield, Roger Sawyer, David Blankenship and Eddie Johnson was always in competition, and passed the track championship around throughout the decade. On Saturdays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the track would often feature an enduro race that would include upwards of 80 cars racing in a 100-lap melee. These races were incredibly hard to keep up with, as the track was constantly completely congested with cars. The track would also feature a number of other divisions on certain occasions, including Modifieds, Pure Stocks, Factory Stocks, Go- Karts, and many others. In the early 1990s, Southside Speedway created an Enduro-type division that would race every week with the rest of the Friday night racing activity. Originally, these cars were called Street Stocks, but the name was changed the next year or two years later to \\"Southside Chargers.\\" Wayne Patterson lost his sponsorship with Pabst Blue Ribbon during the late 1980s, giving way for Roy Hendrick to dominate the Late Model Stock Cars throughout the early 1990s. The battle for second was almost always fought between Bugs Hairfield, Eddie Johnson and Shayne Lockhart. This continued until Wayne Patterson made his return during the mid-1990s and resurged the Hendrick/Patterson rivalry. During the mid-1990s, Shayne Lockhart was the dominant force, and Eddie Johnson fell into the limelight during the late 1990s. =Denny Hamlin= In the early 2000s, Denny Hamlin first started racing in the Mini Stock division at Southside Speedway in 1997. Within the next five years, he would see his share of wins and track records at Southside Speedway, as well as in neighboring tracks in Southampton, Langley and South Boston. After racing in the Craftsman Truck Series and the Busch Series, Hamlin was signed by Joe Gibbs Racing and ran his first full-time Nextel Cup season in 2006. That year, he swept both races at Pocono International Raceway, earned the Nextel Cup Rookie of the Year title, and qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup. Curtis Markham, former Southside Speedway track champion, is currently Hamlin's spotter. From 2008 to 2010, Hamlin has hosted the Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown (previously known as the Denny Hamlin 175), which later moved to Richmond International Raceway. =The Present= During the mid-2000s, Southside Speedway vastly expanded its horizons by offering up to eight divisions of racing. The two main attractions, the Late Model Sportsman division and the Modified division, typically alternate between their respected Friday nights. Chris Dodson was the 2007 track champion in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson was the 2007 Modified track Champion. To keep the three family traditions going, Brandon Hendrick and Chris Hairfield, grandsons of Ray Hendrick and Ted Hairfield and sons of Roy Hendrick and Bug's Hairfield, have become contenders in the Late Model Sportsman division. Chris Johnson, grandson of Cal Johnson and son of Eddie Johnson, also races the #36 car in the Modified division and won his first feature event on opening night of 2008. During the 2007 season the two feature divisions were dominated by Chris Dodson in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson in the Modified Division. Rudy was the only driver other than Stinson to win in the Modified division in 2007. In 2008 that would change. The 7-car invert before each race has made winning a bigger challenge for Stinson, which has allowed other drivers such as Chris Johnson and Billy Morris to capture wins, but consistency still keeps Stinson in a generous points lead. Thomas Stinson has proven to be a class by himself. An unparalleled financial devotion to his car and race team has made him the obvious front-runner in the Modified division. In clean air, it is obvious to any spectator that Stinson's car is blatantly unmatched. Despite the 7-car invert and shortening modified races to 33 laps, current Modified events at Southside are often viewed as Stinson's struggle against the clock to gain the lead. It isn't a question of whether Stinson can gain the lead, rather a question of whether he has enough time. This is a contrast to the Late Model Sportsman division where, though many races may be decided upon qualifying, you never know who that driver will be walking into the gate. In the modified division, if Stinson's car is in the pit stall, chances are it'll be in victory lane. Since 2006, Stinson has won 48 out of 76 (63%) Modified events, including 9 out of 12 in 2007. Current Racing Divisions =Late Model Sportsman= The Late Model Sportsman division essentially entails cars built for racing that are modeled after modern 4-door sedans. The cars are typically badged as Chevrolet Monte Carlos, Dodge Chargers, Toyota Camrys, or Ford Fusions, but are built ground-up for racing. Like cars featured in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, they are \\"stock\\" cars in theory. Aside from being shaped similar to the street model cars they represent, they are essentially fabricated and built identically, and for the sole purpose of stock car racing. Parts may be built by different manufacturers and may come from a differing manufacturing process, however the differences between the cars themselves are negligible. This is opposed to other divisions like Grand Stocks or Street Stocks in which actual street cars are gutted and fitted with the necessary modifications for the race track. It is a common misconception that the Late Model Stock Car division was renamed to Late Model Sportsman at some point. According to track ownership, the current Late Model Sportsman division is a result of the 2003 migration from the old Grand Stock division. Technically, the current Grand Stock division is a new division, and the Late Model Stock Cars are now defunct. The older Late Model Stock Cars were highly modified street cars, but the new Late Model Sportsman cars are actual racing cars with fabricated bodies and contain mostly racing parts. The current Late Model Sportsman division qualifies via time trials and runs features of 150 laps, 100 laps, 75 laps, or 50 laps. =Modifieds= \\"Modifieds\\" are open- wheel cars that behave similarly to the Late Model Sportsman cars. Most modern Modifieds are built as if they will be raced on dirt, and the suspension is designed to drift into turns on dirt tracks as opposed to \\"sticking\\" on pavement. Though modifications are made, Modifieds are typically harder to handle on the pavement, and are still driven to glide into turns as opposed to railing around them. The Modified class was the original feature class at Southside Speedway, though by comparison, the original Modifieds and the modern class of Modifieds have opposite theories. In the early days of short track racing, all stock cars were modified street cars. From there, further modifications would be necessary for them to qualify as a part of a \\"Modified\\" class. Today, since most premier stock car racing series' feature cars built specifically for their destined racing purpose, current Modifieds are built with the premise of becoming \\"Modifieds.\\" Thus, they are being used for their essential conceived purpose, and are \\"modified\\" in name-only. These cars, which are now one of the premier classes at Southside Speedway alternate with the Late Model Sportsman division, running every other Friday night. In past years they have run 100-lap features, but in 2008 they are only slated for one 100-lap feature, and most other nights they are scheduled to run twin 50-lap races. =Grand Stock= The Grand Stock class as seen as the first level under the Late Model Sportsman and the Modifieds. While Southside Speedway has historically almost always had a Grand Stock division, this is seen as a \\"new\\" division as of a few years ago. This class is the more premier class of actual street cars. While the front-end may be customized, the rest of the body is mainly stock. Almost always 90% of a Grand Stock field will consist of the Monte Carlo of the late 1980s. The Grand Stock division runs 30-lap races and qualifies via 10-lap heat races. =U-Cars= The U-Cars were debuted in 2003. While Southside Speedway features a karting division, the U-Cars are seen as the beginning class. U-Car is an acronym meaning \\"U Can Afford to Race\\", and encompasses American-made 4-cylinder cars. The U-Car race is seen as a \\"new\\" division, but is practically a recycled version of the Mini Stock class of the 1980s and 1990s. =Street Stock= The Street Stock division is the evolution of the old Enduro Races on Saturdays brought to Southside Speedway by Joe Kelly in the mid-80's. During the late 1980s, Southside began experimenting with an Enduro-type class on Friday nights by bringing the Factory Stocks to Southside once or twice a year. When the Enduro races became a Friday night feature at Southside, they were brought on as Street Stocks and eventually became the Southside Chargers. After the series was changed back to Street Stock for several years, they were disbanded for a few years. They were brought back in the mid-2000s, being known as the \\"Enduro\\" division and was meant as a no-holds-barred, anything-goes division. After the apparent need for some safety considerations were met, the Enduro cars were fitted with roll cages, the rules were changed and the division became known as Street Stocks again. Attendance Southside Speedway has gone through a roller coaster of variations in attendance over the years. At times, Southside Speedway has struggled and survived many years of near shut-down, and at other times Southside Speedway packs the stands every Friday night. During the early 1980s, attendance was an issue as the track found it difficult to find cars to race, and would often jump through hoops to provide extra incentive for fans to show up. Around this time, the track was condemned by Chesterfield County because of serious safety hazards associated with the old wooden grandstands. The stands were upgraded in 1983. In the late 1980s however, the track was fitted with newer aluminum grandstands that could hold twice as many fans and there was promise for a next generation to begin. Despite these changes, Southside Speedway was rumored to be replaced by a shopping mall in 1987–88. There were even talks of building a new track to replace it in neighboring Dinwiddie County. In the early 2000s, there was talk of possibly lengthening the track, but ultimately the decision was made to keep it the way it was. When Denny Hamlin came from Southside and landed in the Sprint Cup series, fans all over Richmond who have jumped on the bandwagon have caused a resurgence of attendance at Southside. In 2007, Denny Hamlin came to Southside on a Thursday night on the week of the May Sprint Cup race at Richmond International Raceway and Southside saw the best attendance it had seen in years. The following year, Denny Hamlin brought Joe Gibbs teammate Kyle Busch to the track to race in a special 175-lap Late Model Sportsman event to benefit the newly founded Denny Hamlin Foundation. Kyle Busch won that race after Denny Hamlin was sent to the rear of the field early in the event after an incident involving Billy Morris. The race put Southside Speedway in the national spotlight as the event was talked about that weekend during coverage of racing, qualifying and practice for the ensuing races at RIR on Speed and FOX.

The teams were: *(1) Atlanta Braves (Eastern Division champion, 96–66) vs. (4) Los Angeles Dodgers (Wild Card, 90–72): Braves won series, 3–0. *(2) San Diego Padres (Western Division champion, 91–71) vs. (3) St. Louis Cardinals (Central Division champion, 88–74): Cardinals won series, 3–0.The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was not tied to playing record but was predetermined—a highly unpopular arrangement which was discontinued after the 1997 playoffs. Also, the team with home field \\"advantage\\" was required to play the first two games on the road, with potentially the last three at home, in order to reduce travel. The Padres played the Cardinals, rather than the wild card Dodgers, because the Padres and Dodgers are in the same division. Had the 1996 NLDS been played under the 1998-2011 arrangement, then Atlanta (1) would have still faced off against Los Angeles (St. Louis had a worse record, but would have faced Atlanta because of the mandate of no teams from the same division playing against each other in the Division Series) and San Diego likewise would have still faced off against St. Louis, but the Cardinals would have had home field advantage. Under the 2012-present format, which removed the prohibition against teams from the same division meeting in the Division Series, the matchups still would have been Atlanta-Los Angeles and St. Louis- San Diego, with the Braves and Cardinals having home field advantage. The St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves both swept their Division Series, and went on to meet in the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Braves would rally to win that series four games to three and become the National League champion, but would lose to the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1996 World Series. Matchups =San Diego Padres vs. St. Louis Cardinals= =Atlanta Braves vs. Los Angeles Dodgers= San Diego vs. St. Louis =Game 1= Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis The Cardinals and Padres met for the first time in the postseason. A three-run home run by Gary Gaetti off Joey Hamilton put the Cardinals up for good. Todd Stottlemyre pitched masterfully, allowing only a home run by Rickey Henderson. Rick Honeycutt and Dennis Eckersley shut the Padres down for the win. =Game 2= Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis A well fought Game 2 saw the Cardinals squander two leads. Scott Sanders faced Andy Benes. Willie McGee put the Cardinals on top on the third with an RBI single after two walks. Ken Caminiti tied the game with a leadoff home run in the fifth. In the bottom of the inning, Sanders allowed two singles and a walk to load the bases with one out before Ron Gant cleared them with a double off of Dario Veras to make it 4–1 Cardinals. In the sixth, after back-to-back one- out singles, a two-run single by Tony Gwynn aided by center fielder Willie McGee's throwing error made it a one-run game in the Padres sixth. In the eighth, Benes allowed a leadoff single and walk. A sacrifice bunt moved the runners up off of Rick Honeycutt before an RBI ground out by Steve Finley tied the game, but in the bottom half, Doug Bochtler walked two and threw a wild pitch to put runners on second and third with one out. Tom Pagnozzi's ground out off of Trevor Hoffman scored Brian Jordan and put the Cardinals up 5–4. Dennis Eckersley got his second save of the postseason with a perfect ninth. =Game 3= Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego In Game 3, the Cardinals looked to Donovan Osborne to put the Padres away. Opposing the potential sweep was Andy Ashby. Brian Jordan put the Cardinals ahead when he singled to center field to score Royce Clayton, who walked to lead off and moved to second on a single. After back-to-back one-out singles, Chris Gomez's fielder's choice and Jody Reed's double scored a run each to put the Padres up 2–1. Then Ken Caminiti homered to make it 3–1 in the third. An RBI single in the bottom of the fourth by Reed after back-to-back leadoff singles made it 4–1 Padres and Osborne was done. A leadoff homer by Ron Gant made it 4–2 in the sixth. Then, Jordan singled, stole second, and scored on a one-out triple by John Mabry. Tim Worrell relieved Ashby and allowed an RBI single to Tom Pagnozzi to tie the game at four. The Cardinals would take the lead in the seventh when Ray Lankford scored on a bases-loaded double play by Gant. Caminiti's second home run of the game off of Rick Honeycutt tied the game in the eighth, However, after a walk in the ninth, Jordan hit a two-run home run off of Trevor Hoffman that proved to be the series winner. A one-out single by Rickey Henderson in the ninth put the tying run at the plate but nothing would be made of it as Eckersley got his third save in as many tries to win the series. =Composite box= 1996 NLDS (3–0): St. Louis Cardinals over San Diego Padres Atlanta vs. Los Angeles =Game 1= Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles The Braves were heavy favorites against the Dodgers, who sneaked into the playoffs on a Wild Card berth. This would be manager Bill Russell's only postseason series as Dodgers manager. The Braves sent 24-game winner John Smoltz to the mound for Game 1. Opposing Smoltz would be Ramón Martínez. The Braves struck first when Fred McGriff's sacrifice fly brought Marquis Grissom, who singled to lead off, stole second and moved to third on a groundout, home in the fourth. Todd Hollandsworth tied the game with an RBI-double in the fifth after a lead off double by Greg Gagne. Smoltz and Martinez dueled for eight innings, when Martinez left the game. When the game moved to extra innings, eventual playoff MVP Javy López hit the go-ahead home run in the tenth off of Antonio Osuna. Mark Wohlers recorded the save and the Braves led the series 1–0. =Game 2= Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles Greg Maddux faced Ismael Valdez in Game 2. Another pitcher's duel took place. Todd Hollandsworth singled to lead off the first and moved to second thanks to an error by Ryan Klesko, Hollandsworth moved to third on a groundout, then scored on Mike Piazza's groundout, but Klesko homered with one out in the bottom half to tie the game at one. Piazza singled to lead off the fourth and moved to second on an error by Marquis Grissom, then Raul Mondesi's RBI double made it 2–1 Dodgers. Fred McGriff led off the seventh inning with a home run to tie the game at two. After Klesko was called out on strikes, Jermaine Dye hit a home run to give the Braves a 3–2 lead. Mark Wohlers got another save in the ninth as the Braves now led the series 2–0 going home. =Game 3= Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta Hideo Nomo faced Tom Glavine for Game 3. The night would sour for Nomo as he gave up a first-inning run, thanks to a McGriff double that scored Chipper Jones, who singled with two outs, and squandered the series in the fourth. Glavine doubled with two outs, then Grissom walked. A double by Mark Lemke scored both Glavine and Grissom. Then Jones homered to put the Braves up 5–0. Nomo was finished and so were the Dodgers. They would scratch out a run apiece in the seventh (on Juan Castro's double to score Greg Gagne, who singled with two outs) and eighth (on Mike Piazza's sacrifice fly off of Mike Bielecki after Greg McMichael allowed a leadoff walk and subsequent double), but no more. Wohlers got his third save in as many tries to end the series. =Composite box= 1996 NLDS (3–0): Atlanta Braves over Los Angeles Dodgers References External links *STL vs. SDP at Baseball-Reference *ATL vs. LAD at Baseball-Reference Category:National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:Atlanta Braves postseason Category:St. Louis Cardinals postseason Category:San Diego Padres postseason Category:Los Angeles Dodgers postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:1996 in Atlanta Category:1996 in Los Angeles Category:1990s in San Diego Category:20th century in St. Louis Category:October 1996 sports events in the United States ","title":"1996 National League Division Series"},{"id":"5642812","text":"Rutgers University Press is a nonprofit academic publishing house, operating in New Brunswick, New Jersey under the auspices of Rutgers University.

History The village church of Ferenbalm, rebuilt after a fire in 1657. Ferenbalm is first mentioned in 1123 as villa de Balmis. Since the 16th Century it was called Feren-Balm to differenate it from Oberbalm. The oldest trace of settlements in the area are scattered grave mounds which are probably from the Hallstatt era. In addition, a grave mound from the La Tene era has been discovered. There was a Roman settlement at Gümirain, of which only bricks and ceramics remain, and another at Biberen, from which bronze pipes have been found. A document has been found which claims that the Kings of Burgundy gave this region to Payerne Priory in 961-62. However it is now believed to be a later forgery. However, by 1123, Ferenbalm was part of the estates of the Priory. During the 13th century the Counts of Kyburg acquired the village and made it part of the Herrschaft of Oltigen. In 1410, the Kyburg Counts were deep in debt and were forced to sell Oltigen and its Herrschaft to the city of Bern. Part of the modern municipality of Ferenbalm was placed in the district of Laupen in 1483. The villages of Biberen and Gammen were added later between 1502 and 1527. The village church of St. Peter and Paul was first mentioned along with the village in 1123. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, which quickly spread throughout the entire canton. In Ferenbalm, the village church converted to the new faith and became a Reformed parish church. The parish included many of the surrounding German speaking communities, some of which were part of the French-speaking Canton of Fribourg. The church of St. Peter and Paul was rebuilt following a fire in 1657. The villages that make up Ferenbalm have always profited from their location at the fork of the road from Bern to Lausanne and Neuchatel. When the railroad built a station in the municipality, it brought additional revenue and residents. Beginning in the 1960s many commuters moved to Ferenbalm and the housing developments of Kleingümmenen, Biberen and Rizenbach were built. Today about half of the working residents commute to jobs in nearby cities. Municipal schools were built in Ferenbalm, Vogelbuch and Gammen.

Of the agricultural land, 54.2% is used for growing crops and 12.3% is pastures, while 1.7% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. Ferenbalm lies on the plateau between the Saane and Bibern rivers. The municipality does not have a central town; it is instead made up of the villages of Ferenbalm, Vogelbuch, Kleingümmenen, Rizenbach, Biberen, Jerisberg, Jerisberghof, Haselhof and the exclave Gammen. It is on the border with the Canton of Fribourg and surrounds an exclave of that Canton. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Laupen, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

The myriad applications for logarithmic information measures tell us precisely how to take the best guess in the face of partial information.Jaynes, E.T. (1998/2003) Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (Cambridge U. Press, New York). In that sense, information theory might be considered a formal expression of the theory of gambling. It is no surprise, therefore, that information theory has applications to games of chance.  Kelly Betting  Kelly betting or proportional betting is an application of information theory to investing and gambling. Its discoverer was John Larry Kelly, Jr. Part of Kelly's insight was to have the gambler maximize the expectation of the logarithm of his capital, rather than the expected profit from each bet. This is important, since in the latter case, one would be led to gamble all he had when presented with a favorable bet, and if he lost, would have no capital with which to place subsequent bets. Kelly realized that it was the logarithm of the gambler's capital which is additive in sequential bets, and \\"to which the law of large numbers applies.\\" =Side information= A bit is the amount of entropy in a bettable event with two possible outcomes and even odds. Obviously we could double our money if we knew beforehand for certain what the outcome of that event would be. Kelly's insight was that no matter how complicated the betting scenario is, we can use an optimum betting strategy, called the Kelly criterion, to make our money grow exponentially with whatever side information we are able to obtain. The value of this \\"illicit\\" side information is measured as mutual information relative to the outcome of the betable event: :\\\\begin{align}I(X;Y) & = \\\\mathbb{E}_Y \\\\\\\\{D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}\\\\big(P(XY) \\\\ P(XI) \\\\big) \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbb{E}_Y \\\\\\\\{D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}\\\\big(P(X\\\\textrm{side\\\\ information\\\\ } Y) \\\\ P(X\\\\textrm{stated\\\\ odds\\\\ }I) \\\\big) \\\\\\\\}, \\\\end{align} where Y is the side information, X is the outcome of the betable event, and I is the state of the bookmaker's knowledge. This is the average Kullback–Leibler divergence, or information gain, of the a posteriori probability distribution of X given the value of Y relative to the a priori distribution, or stated odds, on X. Notice that the expectation is taken over Y rather than X: we need to evaluate how accurate, in the long term, our side information Y is before we start betting real money on X. This is a straightforward application of Bayesian inference. Note that the side information Y might affect not just our knowledge of the event X but also the event itself. For example, Y might be a horse that had too many oats or not enough water. The same mathematics applies in this case, because from the bookmaker's point of view, the occasional race fixing is already taken into account when he makes his odds. The nature of side information is extremely finicky. We have already seen that it can affect the actual event as well as our knowledge of the outcome. Suppose we have an informer, who tells us that a certain horse is going to win. We certainly do not want to bet all our money on that horse just upon a rumor: that informer may be betting on another horse, and may be spreading rumors just so he can get better odds himself. Instead, as we have indicated, we need to evaluate our side information in the long term to see how it correlates with the outcomes of the races. This way we can determine exactly how reliable our informer is, and place our bets precisely to maximize the expected logarithm of our capital according to the Kelly criterion. Even if our informer is lying to us, we can still profit from his lies if we can find some reverse correlation between his tips and the actual race results. =Doubling rate= Doubling rate in gambling on a horse race is Thomas M. Cover, Joy A. Thomas. Elements of information theory, 1st Edition.

This quantity is maximized by proportional (Kelly) gambling: : b = p \\\\, for which : \\\\max_b W(b,p) = \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\log_2 o_i - H(p) \\\\, where H(p) is information entropy. =Expected gains= An important but simple relation exists between the amount of side information a gambler obtains and the expected exponential growth of his capital (Kelly): : \\\\mathbb E \\\\log K_t = \\\\log K_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^t H_i for an optimal betting strategy, where K_0 is the initial capital, K_t is the capital after the tth bet, and H_i is the amount of side information obtained concerning the ith bet (in particular, the mutual information relative to the outcome of each betable event). This equation applies in the absence of any transaction costs or minimum bets. When these constraints apply (as they invariably do in real life), another important gambling concept comes into play: the gambler (or unscrupulous investor) must face a certain probability of ultimate ruin, which is known as the gambler's ruin scenario. Note that even food, clothing, and shelter can be considered fixed transaction costs and thus contribute to the gambler's probability of ultimate ruin. This equation was the first application of Shannon's theory of information outside its prevailing paradigm of data communications (Pierce). Applications for self-information Surprisal and evidence in bits, as logarithmic measures of probability and odds respectively. The logarithmic probability measure self-information or surprisal,Tribus, Myron (1961) Thermodynamics and Thermostatics: An Introduction to Energy, Information and States of Matter, with Engineering Applications (D. Van Nostrand Company Inc., 24 West 40 Street, New York 18, New York, U.S.A) ASIN: B000ARSH5S. whose average is information entropy/uncertainty and whose average difference is KL-divergence, has applications to odds-analysis all by itself. Its two primary strengths are that surprisals: (i) reduce minuscule probabilities to numbers of manageable size, and (ii) add whenever probabilities multiply. For example, one might say that \\"the number of states equals two to the number of bits\\" i.e. #states = 2#bits. Here the quantity that's measured in bits is the logarithmic information measure mentioned above. Hence there are N bits of surprisal in landing all heads on one's first toss of N coins. The additive nature of surprisals, and one's ability to get a feel for their meaning with a handful of coins, can help one put improbable events (like winning the lottery, or having an accident) into context. For example if one out of 17 million tickets is a winner, then the surprisal of winning from a single random selection is about 24 bits. Tossing 24 coins a few times might give you a feel for the surprisal of getting all heads on the first try. The additive nature of this measure also comes in handy when weighing alternatives. For example, imagine that the surprisal of harm from a vaccination is 20 bits. If the surprisal of catching a disease without it is 16 bits, but the surprisal of harm from the disease if you catch it is 2 bits, then the surprisal of harm from NOT getting the vaccination is only 16+2=18 bits. Whether or not you decide to get the vaccination (e.g. the monetary cost of paying for it is not included in this discussion), you can in that way at least take responsibility for a decision informed to the fact that not getting the vaccination involves more than one bit of additional risk. More generally, one can relate probability p to bits of surprisal sbits as probability = 1/2sbits. As suggested above, this is mainly useful with small probabilities. However, Jaynes pointed out that with true-false assertions one can also define bits of evidence ebits as the surprisal against minus the surprisal for. This evidence in bits relates simply to the odds ratio = p/(1-p) = 2ebits, and has advantages similar to those of self-information itself. Applications in games of chance Information theory can be thought of as a way of quantifying information so as to make the best decision in the face of imperfect information. That is, how to make the best decision using only the information you have available. The point of betting is to rationally assess all relevant variables of an uncertain game/race/match, then compare them to the bookmaker's assessments, which usually comes in the form of odds or spreads and place the proper bet if the assessments differ sufficiently.Hansen, Kristen Brinch. (2006) Sports Betting from a Behavioral Finance Point of View (Arhus School of Business). The area of gambling where this has the most use is sports betting. Sports handicapping lends itself to information theory extremely well because of the availability of statistics. For many years noted economists have tested different mathematical theories using sports as their laboratory, with vastly differing results. One theory regarding sports betting is that it is a random walk. Random walk is a scenario where new information, prices and returns will fluctuate by chance, this is part of the efficient market hypothesis. The underlying belief of the efficient market hypothesis is that the market will always make adjustments for any new information. Therefore no one can beat the market because they are trading on the same information from which the market adjusted. However, according to Fama,Fama, E.F. (1970) \\"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Independent Work\\", Journal of Financial Economics Volume 25, 383-417 to have an efficient market three qualities need to be met: * There are no transaction costs in trading securities * All available information is costlessly available to all market participants * All agree on the implications of the current information for the current price and distributions of future prices of each security Statisticians have shown that it's the third condition which allows for information theory to be useful in sports handicapping. When everyone doesn't agree on how information will affect the outcome of the event, we get differing opinions.

Bowen by Anton Schaaf at Vicksburg National Military Park, dedicated 1916 John Stevens Bowen (October 30, 1830 - July 13, 1863) was a career United States Army officer who later became a general in the Confederate Army and a commander in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. He fought at the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, and the Vicksburg Campaign. He is often said to have died just as his abilities were gaining attention.Tucker, p. 74. Early life and education Bowen was born in Bowen's Creek, Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia in Athens (UGA) in the early 1840s where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society, but left before graduating. He later entered the United States Military Academy in 1848, but was suspended in March 1851, for a year. He graduated 13th of 52 cadets in the class of 1853. Among his classmates were future Confederate generals Henry Brevard Davidson, John Bell Hood, and John R. Chambliss, Jr..Patterson, p. 162. He subsequently was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Regiment of Mounted Rifles. He was first assigned to the army cavalry school at Carlisle, Pennsylvania until 1855, when he was transferred to the Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri; while in St. Louis, he met and married Mary Kennerly. He eventually became acting adjutant of the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment; then in early 1855, he was reassigned to Fort McIntosh, Texas. While there, he decided to resign from the army due to loneliness and moved to Georgia, becoming an architect. He designed and built his family's home on Michigan Avenue in St. Louis. Bowen was an acquaintance of Ulysses S. Grant before the war as Grant used to deliver firewood in Bowen's neighborhood. Bowen became a lieutenant colonel in the Georgia militia, but then moved to Missouri in 1857. There he became active in the Missouri Volunteer Militia (MVM). In 1861 he was appointed as lieutenant colonel commanding the MVM's Southwest Battalion, patrolling Missouri's western border against raids by bands of Kansas Jayhawkers.Tucker, pp. 28-30, 32-36, 45, 53-58. Career =American Civil War= In early May 1861, Bowen was ordered to St. Louis where he took command of the new 2nd Regiment MVM, largely composed of members of the pro-secessionist Minutemen paramilitary organization. While serving as the Colonel of the MVM's 2nd Regiment and Chief of Staff to Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost on May 10, 1861, Bowen was captured at Camp Jackson by Union Army Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. As he waited to be exchanged, he was commissioned a colonel in the Confederate States Army on June 11, 1861. After arriving in Memphis, Tennessee he set about recruiting for and organizing the 1st Missouri Infantry.Bowen's actions in entering CSA service and building and training a CSA regiment were almost certainly a violation of his oath of parole as his activities materially assisted the CSA war effort. After Bowen's capture at Vicksburg, Missouri officers in Federal service protested that Bowen was a parole-breaker, but General Grant allowed Bowen, mortally ill at the time, to be paroled again. He was reportedly officially exchanged on November 1 and became a brigade commander, serving at Columbus, Kentucky, under Major General Leonidas Polk.Tucker, pp. 66-72, 80-91. Bowen was promoted to brigadier general on March 14, 1862, and his brigade was assigned to Major General John C. Breckinridge's Reserve Corps of the Army of Mississippi. He distinguished himself in command of his brigade at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was severely wounded by an artillery shell.Tucker, pp. 98, 104-112. After his recovery he was given a brigade command in Mansfield Lovell's division of the Army of West Tennessee and took part in the Second Battle of Corinth. On the first day, Bowen's brigade helped overrun the initial Union positions but Lovell refused Bowen's repeated requests to make further attacks. The following day, Bowen advanced his brigade to within sight the Union fortifications but failed to overrun the Union lines due to the artillery fire and to Lovell's orders not to advance any further. During the Confederate retreat from Corinth, his brigade served as part of the rear guard and held off part of the Union army along the Tuscumbia River for an entire day. Once the army reached Ripley, Mississippi, Bowen brought charges against army commander Earl Van Dorn for failing to make a proper reconnaissance of the Union positions before the battle, \\"marching the troops in a hastily and disorderly manner\\",Tucker, p. 159. failing to attack early on the second day, and neglecting the wounded. The court-martial cleared Van Dorn of all charges.Cozzens, pp. 142, 174, 271-272, 295, 308-309. Van Dorn was relieved of command in December and John C. Pemberton was put in his place commanding the Vicksburg, Mississippi garrison. Bowen was assigned to fortify the post of Grand Gulf with a brigade of infantry. Over the next several weeks, he constructed naval batteries along the river. After becoming convinced that Grant would land near Grand Gulf, he repeatedly requested Pemberton for additional supplies and men but each request was refused. At the Battle of Port Gibson, Bowen, despite being severely outnumbered, managed to delay Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee for most of a day and he personally led two counterattacks. For his stand, he was promoted to major general on May 25, 1863, although his nomination was never approved by the Confederate Congress. Despite pleas for reinforcements, Pemberton and General Joseph E. Johnston failed to react quickly and Grant was able to resume his march through Mississippi. After uniting with the rest of Pemberton's army, Bowen was given a division.Tucker, pp. 176-184, 227-262. He next fought at the Battle of Champion Hill, where a counterattack by his division almost split Grant's army in half. When the rest of the army failed to support his attack, Bowen was forced to retreat. After battle Pemberton retreated to Vicksburg and he ordered Bowen to cover the retreat. He suffered defeat at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on the Big Black River. Accompanying Bowen to Mississippi was his wife, Mary Kennerly Bowen of St. Louis. She refused to be separated from her husband. When Bowen left St. Louis to enter the war, Mary was by his side, leaving their two young children, Menard Kennerly (age 7) and Anna (age 2) at the family home to be cared for by Mary's mother. He took part in the final defense of Vicksburg, helping in the defeat of Union assaults, but grew ill with dysentery during the siege. Early in the siege, Bowen tried to negotiate surrender with Grant, a friend from the antebellum days, but was turned away; he did help ease the negotiations that led to the July 4 surrender. After being paroled, he succumbed to dysentery and died near Edwards, Mississippi.Tucker, pp. 274-285, 289-291, 297-314. He was at first buried near where he died in Mississippi but his body was later transferred to the Confederate States Army Cemetery in Vicksburg. Following his death, he was praised by his contemporaries as being one of the best generals of the Western Theater and referred to by one biographer as being the real \\"Stonewall of the West\\". Other contemporaries also believed that Bowen, \\"was not second to any Major General then in the Confederate Service\\".Tucker, p. 314. An attempt after to war to erect a monument to Bowen failed to raise the necessary funds.Tucker, pp. 2-8, 313, 323-324. His bust stands in the Vicksburg National Military Park near Stockade Redan on Graveyard Road with his brigade.

Fearn Abbey – known as \\"The Lamp of the North\\" – has its origins in one of Scotland's oldest pre-Reformation church buildings. Part of the Church of Scotland and located to the southeast of Tain, Ross-shire, it continues as an active parish church (united with Nigg and linked with Tarbat). Design The church is extremely simple in design. It is oblong in shape, 96 feet long and 26 feet wide internally. The windows are tall lancets. In the east gable there are four lancets equal in height, and similar openings appear in pairs between all the buttresses around the wall. The eastern end was partitioned off and set aside as the burial vault of the family of Ross of Balnagown. The chapels or aisles attached to the church were erected at later dates against the original walls. The most important addition to the building was the south wing, a chapel dedicated to St. Michael, which was probably erected by Abbot Finlay McFead (d. 1485). It is 32 feet long by 23 feet wide and is connected to the main building by an archway 14 feet wide. On the west side is a doorway; on the east side, an ambry, or recess; on the south side, a canopied monument to Abbot Finlay, which displays the abbot’s shield and the inscription: “Hic jacet Finlaius McFaed abbas de Fern qui obit anno MCCCCLXXXV” (Here lies Finlay McFaed, abbot of Fearn, who died in the year 1485.) A small monumental chapel was erected, probably in the sixteenth century, against the southeast angle of the church, blocking two of the windows. Another chapel was built against the north wall of the church. The cloister and domestic buildings no longer survive. Over the centuries, the rope of the church bell has worn a deep crevice into the stones of the church wall beneath the bell tower. History =Medieval Period= The original Fearn Abbey was established during the reign of Alexander II by Premonstratensians from Whithorn Priory, a monastery of white canons, who provided the first abbot. The Abbey was originally settled by Fearchar, 1st Earl of Ross, in the 1220s but was moved ten miles to the southeast in 1238 during the time of the second abbot, Malcolm of Nigg. The move was deemed necessary because of the turbulence created by the northern clans, but the richer soil for agriculture was also a boon. The Abbey was within the domains of the earls of Ross, who maintained and protected it over the years. In 1321, Mark, a canon of Whithorn, was presented to the abbacy by the prior of Withorn, rather than being elected by the canons. On the orders of William III, Earl of Ross, the rebuilding of the Abbey was begun during Abbot Mark’s time in 1338, and completed during the tenure of Abbot Donald Pupill in 1372. During the forty-four year tenure of Abbot Finlay McFaed (1442-1485), numerous improvements were made. A cloister was added and the Abbey was enriched by an organ, tabernacles, chalices, vestments, and other embellishments from Flanders. =Reformation Era= In the early sixteenth century, the commendatorship was assumed by Patrick Hamilton, a boy at the time. Hamilton, who adopted Reformation principles, was burned as a heretic at the age of twenty-six in 1528. In 1539, King James V recommended to Pope Paul III that Robert Cairncross, Bishop of Ross, be appointed abbot of Fearn, primarily because Cairncross, as a man of wealth, was deemed capable of restoring the buildings, which had fallen into disrepair. Nicholas Ross, provost of the collegiate church of Tain, held the abbacy after the death of Cairncross in 1545. He is thought to have held the position as a secular charge since he sat in Parliament in 1560 and voted for the abolition of Catholicism in Scotland. =Post-Reformation Era= In 1587, during the commendatorship of Walter Ross of Morangy, son of Abbot Thomas Ross, the lands were resumed by the Crown. The Abbey was granted to Patrick Gordon of Letterfourie in 1591. Fearn was erected into the barony of Geanies in favor of Sir Patrick Murray by James VI in 1598. In 1609, it was annexed to the see of Ross for Bishop David Lindsay, and, in 1616, to Bishop Patrick Lindsay, as confirmed by Act of Parliament on 28 June 1617. The grants were confirmed to Bishop John Maxwell by Charles I in 1633. Following the Reformation, the Abbey remained in use as a parish church, but disaster struck in 1742 when the flagstone roof collapsed during a service, killing nearly fifty members of the congregation. Though a new church was built adjacent to the ruined church, it too had fallen into a ruinous state by the early 1770s. As a result, part of the original ruined Abbey was rebuilt in 1772, and the Abbey again became the parish church as part of the established Protestant Church of Scotland. =20th and 21st Centuries= The current building substantially dates from the restoration of 1772, but still incorporates parts of the medieval structure. It was restored by Ian G. Lindsay & Partners in 1971. Further restoration was carried out in 2002–2003 under the auspices of Historic Scotland. The congregation of Fearn Abbey take part in outreach work in the local area and have active links to the Church of Scotland's World Mission projects in Ekwendeni, Malawi, and the Tabeetha School in Israel.

Ekgmoiteptecela MacDonald, 1963 was synonymized with Eusmilus by some authors, but is actually synonymous with Hoplophoneus. One study performed in 2016 suggests that Eusmilus is a non-valid genus, and moved all North American species to Hoplophoneus. Morphology Eusmilus had a long body and was about as tall as a leopard. It had developed long saber teeth and looked like a saber-toothed cat, but was actually a so-called 'false saber-tooth'. Most were leopard-sized and rather long-bodied and short-legged compared to modern leopards. Some reached 2.5 metres (8 ft) long. Eusmilus had lost many other teeth, possessing only 26 instead of the 44 usually seen in carnivore mammals. Its mouth could open to an angle of 90 degrees, allowing the creature to properly use its saber teeth. Bony flanges projected from Eusmilus ' lower jaw to protect the sabers (this is also seen in the unrelated marsupial Thylacosmilus and felid Megantereon). There is fossil evidence of conflict between Eusmilus and Nimravus, another genus of nimravid. Growth and Development Eusmilus cubs and adolescents have been discovered, and examinations of their skeletons indicates that their saber-teeth emerged late in life, indicating the animals were dependent on their mothers for a relatively long period. The milk teeth of Eusmilus, upon their eruption, were large enough to allow it to hunt effectively. The added advantage of these milk sabers was that because of the late growth of the permanent sabers, if the milk saber-teeth were damaged, the nimravid had a chance to grow a new set of saber-teeth, allowing it to continue hunting.

Woodstock is bounded on the north by Southeast Holgate Boulevard, east by Southeast 45th and Southeast 60th Streets, south by Johnson Creek, and west by Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard (formerly Southeast 39th Avenue). Woodstock borders the neighborhoods of Reed and Eastmoreland on the west, Creston-Kenilworth on the north, Mt. Scott-Arleta and Brentwood-Darlington on the east, and Ardenwald-Johnson Creek on the south. Geography Woodstock, located in inner southeast Portland, is bounded on the north by Southeast Holgate Boulevard, east by Southeast 45th and Southeast 60th Streets, south by Johnson Creek, and west by Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard (formerly Southeast 39th Avenue). History The Woodstock neighborhood is one of Portland's oldest, first platted in 1889. Many of its oldest houses, some constructed as early as the 1880s, are located in the northern part of the neighborhood. The northeast corner and southern panhandle contain mostly houses built following World War II. Urban infill is spread throughout the neighborhood but is concentrated in its eastern section. The land now occupied by Woodstock was wilderness until the 1850s. In 1848, Clinton Kelly and his extended family arrived from Kentucky. Kelly, a Methodist minister, and his brothers migrated their families to the Oregon Territory, fleeing the Civil War and taking advantage of offers for free land. The Kelly family sought land suitable for farming. In December 1852, at the age of 21, Archon Kelly (Clinton and Mary's third son) received of wilderness on a plateau overlooking the underdeveloped area of land that now encompasses the Eastmoreland neighborhood and Reed College. Using current markers, Archon's land was bounded on the north by Southeast Raymond, on the east by Southeast 52nd Avenue, on the south by Duke Street, and on the west by Southeast 42nd Avenue. Archon lived on the farm until he sold it to Clinton for $2,500 in January 1863. Ownership changed several more times and in 1889 the land was platted for residential development. A group of five men, including trustee James Havely, purchased of the land for $48,000. They named the subdivision Woodstock after Walter Scott's 1826 novel of the same name (naming residential subdivisions after romantic novels became \\"en vogue\\" as family names were used and became more scarce over time; Woodstock is one of several subdivisions in southeast Portland named after Scott's writings). In 1893, Havely built one of Woodstock's first houses, a Queen Anne style residence on Southeast 40th Avenue now designated as a historic landmark. Havely is also credited for arranging to supply the neighborhood with electricity and water. Description Business and civic activity is concentrated in Woodstock's Village Center located on Southeast Woodstock Boulevard between Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard (Southeast 39th Avenue) and Southeast 52nd Avenue. Churches, the Woodstock Library, and the Woodstock Community Center are interspersed with large and small commercial establishments offering a wide range of consumer goods and services.

History Frauenkappelen church and village Frauenkappelen is first mentioned in 1158 as Capela. In 1574 the town became a parish. The oldest traces of a settlement in the area are several Hallstatt era grave mounds in the Spilwald forest. A Roman era estate has also been found in the woods. It appears that the area around the modern municipality was abandoned until the Early Middle Ages. By 1241 the Alt-Bubenberg Castle was built on the hills above the Aare river. Between 1228 and 1240, the Augustinian Sancta Maria de Cappellis Abbey was built in Foresto. Over the following centuries Alt-Bubenberg Castle lost its importance and was abandoned in the 14th century. Today only the ruins of the walls are still visible. The Abbey, on the other hand, grew with donations from local nobles. By the 14th century it owned land throughout the Sense valley, especially around the town of Rüti bei Büren. The Abbey also owned vineyards along Lake Biel. The Abbey had its own seal in 1251. It had about ten nuns under an Abbess with a provost supplied from another Abbey. Initially the Abbey was under the Augustinian Köniz Abbey, until was absorbed by the Teutonic Knights in 1226 or 1235. After that the provost was appointed by a local committee or by the Bishop of Lausanne. In 1486 the newly created college of canons at the Cathedral of Bern acquired the entire Abbey and its lands. The remaining six nuns were allowed to remain at the Abbey for the rest of their lives. The Abbey church was initially part of the parish of Mühleberg. It remained part of the parish after the Canton of Bern converted to the new faith during the Protestant Reformation. When it was rebuilt in 1574, it became the parish church for the new Frauenkappelen parish. The Abbey buildings were used as a rectory until they were demolished in 1640. In 1742-48 Bern built a road from Murten to Bern to Lausanne and Frauenkappelen was the first way station out of Bern on the road. An inn, a blacksmith, a general store and a pilgrim's hostel were built for the travelers. However, the municipality remained generally rural until the 1960s when the expanding agglomeration of Bern brought factories and commuters to the municipality. During the same decade the Federal Bureau for Infantry moved into the municipality. Today Frauenkappelen is a mostly rural community on the outskirts of the suburbs of Bern.

Les Wampas are a French punk rock/psychobilly band, who refer more exactly to their music as \\"Yé-yé-punk\\". The band was formed in Paris in 1983. History :See also Discography The band's first album, Tutti Frutti was released in 1986. Their third album, Les Wampas vous aiment (Les Wampas love you), released in 1990, contained the popular single \\"Petite Fille\\", whose video was played on French TV channel M6, and also includes crowd favorites \\"Ce soir c'est Noël\\" (a personal version of the Christmas Carols, available all year long on stage...) and \\"Quelle joie le rock'n'roll\\". Following this album's release they were signed by the major label BMG. However, a shadow was cast across the band for many years when guitarist Marc Police committed suicide in December 1991. =Simple et Tendre= Simple et tendre (1993) was recorded at London's Roundhouse and Abbey Road studios and featured the London Session Orchestra. Recorded one year after guitarist Marc Police's suicide and probably their most inspired album, it includes a heart-breaking, breathtaking — and yet hilarious — tribute song to their friend (\\"Les îles au soleil\\", \\"Islands under the sun\\"). The video to the band's \\"Comme un ange (qui pleure)\\" (1992) was directed by Michel Gondry. =Never trust a guy... and \\"Manu Chao\\"= Having been back on the 'independent circuit' since their contract with BMG ended in 1998, Les Wampas released the single \\"Manu Chao\\" in 2003. It, along with the album's full title, Never trust a guy who after having been a punk, is now playing electro, made fun of Manu Chao, who was a member of the successful punk band Mano Negra in the early 1990s (like Wampas guitarist Jo Dahan), but who now, according to Didier Wampas, \\"had accepted the system. You're inside of it, you profit from it, you're not going to criticize it 'on the side', or else you might not get back in.\\" With a riff similar to The Ramones' \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\", Manu Chao was the band's most popular single to date, reaching number 20 in France in June 2003 and features as a bonus track in the European version of Rock Band. Les Wampas played at the Eurockéennes and Vieilles Charrues festivals in that year, and a rockumentary about them, For the rock, was made in 2004. =Rock'n'Roll Part 9= On Rock'n'Roll Part 9, Les Wampas' ninth album (not including two live albums), they released the controversial single \\"Chirac en prison\\" in January 2006. The song contains the lyrics: \\"Elle ne pense qu'à ça, elle n'en dort plus la nuit [...] La seule chose qui lui ferait plaisir Ce serait de voir Chirac en prison.\\" \\"She thinks only of this, she doesn't sleep anymore at night [...] The only thing that would give her pleasure Would be to see Chirac in prison.\\" However, Didier Wampas said, \\"It isn't really a song against Chirac [...] I just wanted to see how far freedom of expression can go\\".Article in Le Monde, 14 January 2006 \\"Chirac en prison\\" was mainly banned upon its release by French TV and radio; some TV advertisements for the single were even populated with bleeps and on-screen rectangles, to disguise the fact that the song was about the president. It was played by radio stations Ouï FM and Le Mouv', however, and achieved much more publicity when Les Guignols de l'info, a satirical puppet show on Canal+ television, made a video for the song. \\"Rimini\\" was the most notable success from Rock'n'Roll Part 9. This song has become widely popular among the fans. It is about the death of the famous Italian cyclist Marco Pantani who was found dead in an hotel of the Italian seaside resort of Rimini. =2007 Eurovision entry= Les Wampas competed against nine other popular French acts for the chance of representing France at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, with a song called \\"Faut voter pour nous\\" (\\"You gotta vote for us\\"), but did not win the vote.

He deliberately sings off-key and often high- pitched, hence his recognizable voice. His on-stage energy, and crowd surfing, hoisted and hauled up on garden chairs, are major features of the band's live shows, which frequently end up in a complete mess, Didier Wampas singing among the audience, and a large part of the audience going onto the stage. Since the release of the album Kiss (2000), he comes to hug members of the audience at the end of the show and kiss them goodbye on each cheek. In interviews, Didier Wampas often repeats that he earns approximately a quarter of his private incomes from his activity as a singer, and the rest from his job as a mechanic at the RATP (public transportation service in Paris), which he kept in spite of the increasing fame and success of the band. He frequently asserts his opposition to the French system of giving grants to professionals in the performing arts — this attitude is remarkable in the French culture. In October 2011, Didier Wampas released his first solo album entitled Taisez moi (Silence me) which was recorded in Los Angeles and Brussels with musicians Ryan Ross (Ex Panic! at the Disco), Nick Johns and Kevin Harp. The album included the songs \\"Chanteur de droite\\" (a defense of the French singer Michel Sardou) and \\"Karmann\\"; a tribute to deceased ex-guitarist Marc Police. In May 2012, he announced his retirement from the RATP on French TV. In January 2013, Didier began recording his second solo album entitled Comme dans une garage (Like in a garage) at Toerag Studios in London with the Bikini Machine. It was released in April 2013 credited to \\"Didier Wampas & Bikini Machine\\".

Les Wampas have toured in most western European countries, as well as Quebec, Japan, India, and La Réunion. However, they had seemingly never played in English-speaking Canada or Great Britain, until January 2013 when they played the Paris is Burning show at the Lexington, London. They only played once in the United States (in Austin, April 1995). Commercial success has mainly been in France, Les Wampas mainly singing in French.

Design and construction 25-ton disappearing muzzle-loading rifles photographed in its raised, or firing, position. Depictions in the 1888 edition of Brasseys Naval Annual of Temeraires disappearing gun in its loading and firing positions. She was built at Chatham, on a slipway adjoining that on which , who would precede her into service by some seven months, was being built. She was designed at a time when the shortcomings of the traditional broadside battery - limited axial fire, low command, inactivity of half the guns in single-ship duels, heavy crew and difficulty in working the guns in seaway - were stimulating designers to develop improvements in artillery deployment. Her armament was partly conventional, being deployed on the broadside, and partly experimental; she was the first British ship to be equipped with guns in barbettes located on the midline on the upper deck. Indeed, she was the first British ship with barbettes of any kind. The foremost barbette was located ahead of the foremast, and had a field of fire ahead, extending to well abaft the beam on both sides. To achieve the same degree of freedom of fire from the after barbette the mizzen mast was deleted, and the after barbette placed aft of the mainmast. Temeraire and Alexandra were the only British battleships ever to carry guns of calibre. The design of the barbettes was itself unique, being one of the few ships to have been equipped with disappearing guns. On firing, the recoil of the gun caused it to drop below deck level; this allowed re-loading without the exposure of the gun crew to aimed enemy fire. After loading, the gun was rotated by a hydraulic system back into the firing position. While this system was effective, it was slow and expensive and was never repeated. The suppression of the mizzen mast resulted in Temeraire being the largest ship ever to sail with brig rig, that is, with sail carried on only two masts. She was known during her life as \\"the Great Brig\\".  Service history  She was commissioned at Chatham in 1877 for service in the Mediterranean, where she spent the next fourteen years with the exception of the winter of 1887-1888, when she was with the Channel Fleet. She was with Admiral Geoffrey Hornby through the Dardanelles in 1878, and remained in the vicinity of Constantinople for a year thereafter. After recommissioning at Malta in 1881 she was present at the bombardment of Alexandria (1882) under command of Captain H F Nicholson, firing 136 shells and 84 .Goodrich, Caspar F (Lt Cdr), Report of the British Naval and Military Operations In Egypt 1882, Navy Department, Washington, 1885, p.29 Captain Compton Domvile was in command 1884-87, when she served on the Mediterranean Station. She paid off at Portsmouth in 1887, and then returned to the Mediterranean for her final three years of active service. In October 1890 Temeraire made port at Suda Bay, Crete, under sail alone, the last British naval ship ever to do so.Sam Willis,The Fighting Temeraire, Postscript. She was paid off at Devonport in 1891. She was in the Reserve Fleet until 1893, when she was downgraded to Fleet Reserve. She was dockyard Reserve in 1901, and in January the following year it was announced that she would be removed from the effective list of navy ships. Captain Arthur William Edward Prothero was appointed in command on 16 July 1902, when she was commissioned as depot ship for the Devonport Fleet Reserve, and later that year he became flag captain to the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, who used the ship as his flagship from 1 October. In 1904 she became part of the Indus stoker training establishment, and was renamed Indus II. In 1915, under the new name of Akbar, she was transferred to Liverpool as a reformatory ship. During the First World War she served as a depot ship, and was finally sold 26 May 1921.  References  Publications * * Oscar Parkes British Battleships * Roger Chesneau and Eugene M.

Geology Mount Slesse & its neighbouring range. Most of Mount Slesse is made up of granitic rocks related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaMiocene peralkaline volcanism in west- central British Columbia - Its temporal and plate-tectonics settingCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier The primary rock comprising Slesse is grey diorite from the batholith. However the summit ridge and the west face are composed of Darrington Phyllite, a metamorphic rock, produced by contact metamorphism with the rock of the batholith and with an intrusion of granodiorite. History Mount Slesse was first climbed on August 10, 1927, by Stan Henderson, Mills Winram, and Fred Parkes, via a route starting from Slesse Creek. The standard route today is the Southwest Route, which involves approximately of ascent, a good deal of scrambling and some sections of technical rock climbing up to class 5.6. However Slesse is most famous for the Northeast Buttress, first climbed on August 28, 1963 by Fred Beckey, Steve Marts, and Eric Bjornstad. It is a serious multi-day rock climb (Grade V) with technical difficulty of class 5.8 or 5.9. This climb is featured in Roper and Steck's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America. In July 1966 Hans Baer and Jack Bryan did the second ascent of this route, with one bivouac and a straightline exit at the top of the buttress.

Prominent among the dead were team members of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Saskatchewan Roughriders, on their way home from the annual East-West All-Star Game in Vancouver. A memorial to the dead can be found on a spur road just above the Chilliwack River Road. The site itself was supposed to have been consecrated by the Cemeteries Act after the discovery of the crash site and associated human remains, some of which were gathered into a common grave, others found by climbers and hikers have been placed in a \\"shrine\\" out of the weather in a discreet location. In the 1990s the provincial government, under pressure from the Families of Slesse organization, finally passed legislation to enshrine protection of the site, which was under threat from clearcut logging at the time, and markers have been placed on trails leading into the site requesting it be respected by hikers and others accessing it.

It is a variant of Baskerville, which was designed in Birmingham, England, in the 1750s. Mrs Eaves adapts Baskerville for use in display contexts, such as headings and book blurbs, through the use of a low x-height and a range of unusual combined characters or ligatures. Mrs Eaves was released by Emigre, a type foundry run by Licko and husband Rudy VanderLans, and has been joined by an 'XL' version for body text, as well as Mr Eaves, a sans-serif companion.Lupton, E. (2004). Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editers, and Students. New York, Princeton Architectural Press.  Description  Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville's wife. Like his typefaces, John Baskerville was, himself, a controversial character. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, he hired Sarah Eaves as his live-in housekeeper; eventually, her husband Richard abandoned her and their five children, and Mrs Eaves became Baskerville's mistress and eventual helpmate with typesetting and printing. She married Baskerville within a month of her estranged husband's death. Selection of the name Mrs Eaves honors one of the forgotten women in the history of typography. Stylistically, Mrs Eaves is a revival of the Baskerville typefaces cut for Baskerville by John Handy. Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves has a near vertical stress, departing from the old style model. Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville's types, are the lowercase g with its open lower counter and swashlike ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swashlike tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif. Licko's design is unorthodox and not a pure revival. In creating it, she was influenced by how it would be printed by contrast to printing in Baskerville's time: considering the flatness of offset lithography in comparison to letterpress printing, and the resolution of set devices and on-screen display. The overall stroke weight of Mrs Eaves is considerably heavier than most other revivals, countering the often anemic reproduction of smaller point sizes in other digital revivals of Baskerville, and restoring some of the feeling of letterpress printing's unpredictability. To compensate for this and create a brighter-looking page, Licko lowered the x-height, reducing the amount of space taken up by ink on the page. Issue 38, The Authentic Issue, saw the first extensive use of Mrs Eaves in Emigre Magazine. In an interview featured in Eye (No. 43, Vol. 11, Spring 2002), Licko explained why she thought Mrs Eaves was a successful typeface: Derivatives Several derivatives of Mrs Eaves have been released. These include Mrs Eaves XL (2009), a tighter derivative with a higher x-height intended for body text, and Mr Eaves and Mr Eaves XL, a sans-serif design similar to Johnston and Gill Sans. Mrs Eaves XL was intended to provide a solution to a common criticism of Mrs Eaves' original release: its very loose and uneven spacing, which makes Mrs Eaves unsuitable for body text. Emigre noted themselves that \\"The spacing is generally too loose for large bodies of text, it sort of rambles along ... Economy of space was not one of the goals behind the original Mrs Eaves design.\\" Mr Eaves was released in both regular and XL designs, matching the original Mrs Eaves and Mrs Eaves XL. Both heights were released in two widths: regular and narrow, and in two styles: Sans, a humanist design closest to the original serif model, and a more simplified Modern design resembling geometric sans-serif fonts like Futura. Ligatures Mrs Eaves is particularly well known for its range of ligatures, ranging from the common to the fanciful and including intertwined and swash designs. Ligatures in all variants of Mrs Eaves include the standard fi, ffi, and fl ligatures, as well as the classic eighteenth-century ct and st ligatures and others with no historical precedent. These have been released in a variety of formats: originally ligatures were released in separate expert set fonts; more recently they are issued as stylistic alternates using the OpenType format. A Just Ligatures variant is available in roman and italic. The OpenType format fonts also contain all 213 ligatures. Identifying characteristics * Tail on lowercase g does not close * Swash-like tail of Q * small counter of italic e compared to italic a * J well below baseline * High crossbar and pointed apex of A * Top and bottom serifs on C * W and w have no middle stroke * Long lower arm of E * Many versions feature a calligraphic J * T has wide arms Prominent uses The WordPress logotype is set in Mrs Eaves. It is also used for the titles (but not author names) on the covers and spines of the current Penguin Classics from Penguin Books. Blacktree's Quicksilver wordmark uses Mrs Eaves.

It was thought to have been the ancestor of the modern leopard seal, however it is now thought to be a species of monk seal. Taxonomy The fossils of A. longirostris have been discovered in the Pisco Formation of Peru and the Bahía Inglesa Formation of Chile. When it was first described in 1981, it was thought to have been closely related to the lobodontine seals which includes the modern day leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), the crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli), and the Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii). However, it is now thought to be a basal species of monk seal of the subfamily Monachinae, closely related to the extinct seal Piscophoca. Description Restoration Acrophoca was around long, and was not as well-adapted to swimming as its descendants, possessing less developed flippers and a less streamlined neck. This may indicate that it spent a lot of time near the coast. Its teeth were built for piercing, implying a diet consisted primarily of fish. However, it also had interdigitated tooth cusps causing the teeth on the upper jaw to fit with the teeth of the lower jaw, which is consistent with filter feeders. Unlike other earless seals, Acrophoca had a long and flexible neck, with an elongated body. The orientation of the pelvis, which in comparison to modern earless seals is everted, as well as adaptations to the hind limbs suggest that swimming was mainly powered by the back flippers. It was less adapted for the sea than the lobodontine seals, suggesting it inhabited nearshore waters. Paleoecology Acrophoca captured by Acrophyseter Its fossils have been found alongside those of the marine sloth Thalassocnus and tusked cetacean Odobenocetops, as well as modern animals such as bottlenose dolphins, gannets and cormorants.

Inherent in the goals of Zeta Omega Eta is a commitment to action and engagement on the campus, in the community, and in the world. Through their work in community service, their roles as leaders in campus organizations, and their pursuit of academic excellence, Zetas seek to reclaim and redefine what it means to be a feminist and to be a sorority sister. The Alpha chapter of the Sisterhood of Zeta Omega Eta was started at Trinity College in 2003 by then Sophomore Meghan Boone as part of a project for Tutorial College. As outlined in the Constitution of the Sisterhood, Zeta Omega Eta is a non-traditional sisterhood devoted to diversity, inclusiveness, and the advancement of feminist ideals. Inherent in the goals of Zeta Omega Eta is a commitment to action and engagement on the campus, in the community, and in the world. Through their work in community service, their roles as leaders in campus organizations, and their pursuit of academic excellence. As of 2007, Trinity College has recognized Zeta Omega Eta as an active Greek organization on campus. Subsequently, Zeta has been granted two seats on the Inter-Greek Council, an organization which seeks to steer the role of the Greeks on campus. As of 2006, Zeta began hosting an annual Young Women's Leadership Conference, which invites girls from the surrounding middle schools to come to the College for a series of discussions and activities which allow them to explore what is ahead in their future as leaders, feminists, and students. The Young Women's Leadership Conference seeks to encourage young women to pursue their dreams and to interact with college women who are available to answer their questions in an open, enthusiastic environment. Zeta is also known for its annual Women in Academia banquet which honors Trinity's female professors and college employees for their pursuits in academia, their roles as female leaders on campus, and their achievements for the Trinity College community. Participants and speakers at the event explore the continuing issue of women's roles in higher education, and to celebrate the triumphs of the women in academia at our college. Interest in the work and achievements of Zeta Omega Eta have led to the publication of several articles regarding the organization in Bust magazine, the Hartford Courant, the Trinity Tripod, Bitch magazine, and salon.com among others. Currently the only active chapter of Zeta is at the University of Michigan. It was founded by then sophomore Courtney Cook in 2015. At Michigan Zeta's primary philanthropic cause is Out of the Darkness, a charitable organization dedicated to suicide awareness and prevention. Zeta Omega Eta at UM continues to uphold the feminist values that the alpha chapter at Trinity were founded on.

History Gals is first mentioned in 1185 as Galles. In French it was known as Chules. The area around Gals has been inhabited for thousands of years. Some of the earliest archeological discoveries include a Bronze Age dug out canoe, Hallstatt grave mounds, La Tène and a Roman era wall. The recorded settlement was a large farm or estate that was built by the Counts of Neuchâtel. The village gradually grew up around the farm. During the 12th or 13th century the village was acquired by the Bernese Abbey of St. Johannsen. It remained part of the Abbey's land until the Abbey was secularized in 1528 during the Protestant Reformation. Gals became part of the Bernese bailiwick of Erlach. Serfdom was abolished relatively late, in 1551. The village first received a village charter in 1652. In the years 1746, 1837, 1852 and 1869, large fires ravaged the village. Between 1874 and 1883 the Zihl canal was built through the region. The canal allowed the villagers to drain the Grissachmoos marsh, which became rich farmland for sugar beets and other crops. In 1894 the village of Zihlbrücke was incorporated into Gals when the border between the Cantons of Bern and Neuchâtel was moved. A brickyard was in operation in the village from 1658 until 1960. In the 19th century a watch parts factory opened, which provided manufacturing jobs. In 1960 the Compagnie Industrielle Radioélectrique opened a factory in Gals. In 1998 it was acquired by Alcatel Space SA. In 1883, the Canton of Bern bought and converted the Abbey of St. Johannsen into a prison, which still continues to provide jobs for the municipality.

They were: *(1) San Francisco Giants (Western Division champions, 90–72) vs. (4) Florida Marlins (Wild Card, 92–70): Marlins win series, 3–0. *(2) Houston Astros (Central Division champions, 84–78) vs. (3) Atlanta Braves (Eastern Division champions, 101–61): Braves win series, 3–0.The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which was not tied to playing record but was predetermined—a highly unpopular arrangement which was discontinued after the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Also, the team with home field \\"advantage\\" was required to play the first two games on the road, with potentially the last three at home, in order to reduce travel. Had the 1997 NLDS been played under the 1998-2011 arrangement, then Atlanta (1) would still have faced off against Houston (3) and San Francisco (2) would likewise have faced off against the wild card winners in Florida (4). Under the format adopted in 2012, which removed the prohibition against teams from the same division meeting in the Division Series, the matchups instead would have been Atlanta-Florida and San Francisco-Houston, with the Braves and Giants having home field advantage. The Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins went on to meet in the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Marlins became the National League champions, and defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series. Matchups =San Francisco Giants vs. Florida Marlins= =Houston Astros vs. Atlanta Braves= San Francisco vs. Florida The San Francisco Giants made it back to the postseason for the first time since the 1989 World Series. The Florida Marlins were in the postseason for the first time ever. =Game 1= Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida Game 1 was a matchup between Kirk Rueter and Kevin Brown. Both pitchers were on even terms, allowing one run and four hits through seven innings. Both teams struck in the seventh with leadoff homers by Bill Mueller and Charles Johnson. The game was tied 1–1 in the bottom of the ninth inning With the bases loaded, Édgar Rentería singled to right to give the Marlins their first ever postseason win with a walk-off. =Game 2= Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida Shawn Estes faced Al Leiter in an exciting Game 2. An RBI single by Mark Lewis made it 1–0 Giants in the first. The Marlins would strike back in the bottom half. Bobby Bonilla hit a two-run homer to make it 2–1 Marlins, but a homer by Brian Johnson tied the game in the second. Then Barry Bonds hit a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 3–2 lead in the third. The Marlins tied it in the bottom half with an RBI single by Bonilla. Stan Javier's infield hit gave the Giants the lead back in the fourth. Hits by Alex Arias and Kurt Abbott gave the Marlins the lead in the bottom half. The Marlins would add another run on a homer by Gary Sheffield in the bottom of the sixth. It was 6–4, but the Giants refused to concede. An RBI double by Bonds made it a one-run game in the seventh. The one-run lead would stand into the ninth. With Robb Nen pitching, the Giants managed to tie the game thanks to a key error by Craig Counsell. However, the Marlins would not wait until extra innings to try to win. Sheffield led the inning off with a single; then he stole second. After Bonilla walked, Moisés Alou hit the game-winning single to center field. The ball was scooped up by Dante Powell, whose throw home was in line with home plate, but the ball hit the mound, allowing Sheffield to score easily. This play would be the defining moment of the series, being replayed many times on highlights, as well as mainstream shows such as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. The Marlins took the series lead, 2–0. =Game 3= 3Com Park at Candlestick Point in San Francisco, California In Game 3, the Giants looked to Wilson Álvarez to keep them alive. Opposing him would be Alex Fernandez, hoping to close out the series. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Jeff Kent hit a home run with one out to make it 1–0 Giants. Later, however, the Marlins would put the series away when Devon White hit a stunning grand slam into the left field bleachers in the top of the sixth. Kent would hit another home run in the bottom half, but two RBI doubles by Charles Johnson and Craig Counsell put any hopes of a Giants comeback out of reach. Robb Nen got Damon Berryhill to ground out to end the series. In response to their team being swept, Giants fans littered the field with garbage as the Marlins players celebrated. This was the final MLB playoff game at Candlestick Park. Until 2016, this was the last time the Giants lost a postseason series at home. In their next 7 appearances, including the wildcard tiebreaker in 1998, they either lost the series on the road or won the World Series until finally losing at home in the 2016 NLDS. As of the 2016 season, this series is the last time the Giants were swept in the postseason. =Composite box= 1997 NLDS (3–0): Florida Marlins over San Francisco Giants Houston vs. Atlanta The Houston Astros finally made it back to the postseason for the first time since the 1986 National League Championship Series. The Atlanta Braves were hosting their first postseason series at Turner Field. =Game 1= Turner Field in Atlanta Game 1 was a matchup between Darryl Kile and Greg Maddux. Kenny Lofton led off the bottom of the first with a double, the first postseason hit at Turner Field. Keith Lockhart flied to right, putting Lofton at third. Then Chipper Jones hit a sacrifice fly to left field to make it 1–0 Braves in the first. Then Ryan Klesko homered to lead off the second, a homer which would prove to be the game winner. The Astros would strike for a run in the fifth, thanks to an RBI single by Kile. Maddux and Kile dueled for seven innings. Kile allowed only two hits and Maddux pitched a complete game. The Astros left five men on base, a fatal error, as the Braves won 2–1. =Game 2= Turner Field in Atlanta The Astros sent Mike Hampton to the mound against Tom Glavine. The game was quiet through the first innings, but, in the bottom of the third, Jeff Blauser hit a three-run homer to put the Braves ahead. The Astros, however, would tie the game thanks to a two-run double by Brad Ausmus and an RBI single by Mike Hampton that scored Ausmus. The Astros would make a game of it, but only for the moment. With two outs in the bottom of the fifth, Hampton would surrender four consecutive walks to give the Braves the lead. Hampton would leave, but Mike Magnante gave up two more runs thanks to a two-run single by Greg Colbrunn. Next inning, Magnante allowed three singles, the last of which to Fred McGriff scoring a run. Ramon Garcia walked Javy Lopez to load the bases before first baseman Jeff Bagwell's error on Andruw Jones's ground ball allowed two runs to score and put runners on second and third. Danny Bautista's two-run single extended the Braves' lead to 11–3. In the eighth, Lopez's two-run double off of Billy Wagner made it 13–3 Braves. Glavine pitched six innings for the win while Mike Cather and Mark Wohlers pitched three scoreless innings of relief to give the Braves a 2–0 series lead. =Game 3= Astrodome in Houston, Texas Game 3 was a battle between John Smoltz and Shane Reynolds. Chipper Jones got the Braves started with a two-out homer in the top of the first. An RBI single by Jeff Blauser made it 2–0 in the second, and another RBI single, by Michael Tucker, made it 3–0 in the seventh. John Smoltz pitched brilliantly, allowing only three hits and one run, a homer by Chuck Carr, in a complete-game victory. A passed ball allowed one final insurance run to make it 4–1 Braves in the eighth.

Grove Music Online. Accessed March 15, 2012.\\"James Oswald (1711–1769)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Accessed March 15, 2012. Life Oswald was born in Crail, Scotland in 1710, being baptised on 21 March, and died in Knebworth, Hertfordshire on 2 January 1769. As a young man he worked in Dunfermline, Fife as a musician and dancing master. Throughout his career he maintained an interest in traditional Scottish music, but he also composed in classical style galant forms. In 1741 he left Edinburgh, eloping to London with Mary Ann Melvill. The poet Allan Ramsay lamented his departure in \\"An Epistle to James Oswald\\". The couple had their first child in 1742 and married on 12 February 1744 in St. James's Church, Piccadilly. They had three daughters.Purser, John (2019), A Champion of Scottish Musical Genius, The National, Monday 18 November 2019, pp. 20 & 21 In London Oswald eventually set up his own publishing house and published the Caledonian Pocket Companion, a collection of Scottish folk tunes, some with his own variations. This ran to 12 volumes and many editions. Like many others whose works feature in the Wighton Collection in Dundee, he was a member of \\"The Temple of Apollo\\", a secret musical society of composers in London along with Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie, John Reid, Charles Burney and others. Oswald's first wife, Mary Ann, died in 1756. He married Leonora Robinson Lytton after she was widowed in 1762.Purser, John (2019), Remarkable Scot's Royal Approval, The National, 25 November 2019, p. 21 Compositions He wrote variations of popular Scottish folk tunes, arranged these for the fiddle and composed other original tunes in the same genre. He published his chamber works under the nom de plume \\"Dottel Figlio\\". A \\"Collection of Minuets\\" was published in Edinburgh in 1736 and a \\"Curious Collection of Scots Tunes\\" in 1740. He probably composed \\"The East Neuk of Fife\\" and \\"The Flowers of Edinburgh\\", \\"two classic reel tunes of the Scots fiddle repertory\\", and wrote tunes which were later used for some of Robert Burns's song lyrics, included in his Caledonian Pocket Companion. The earliest version of 'Ae Fond Kiss' was closely modelled on Oswald's tune 'Rory Dall's Port'. Later, he wrote a collection of German military music, \\"40 Marches, Tattoos and Night Pieces for two German flutes, violins or guittars as performed by the Prussian and Hessian Armies\\". He was appointed Chamber Composer to George III in 1761, when George became King. Since many of his compositions were written anonymously, research still needs to be done to identify them. Some of Oswald's most remarkable creations are his two sets of 'Airs for the Seasons' - some 96 compositions in all - each named for a different flower or shrub, and attributed to their appropriate season of the year. They are playable by violin (flute, oboe) and cello, with second violin parts available for 12 of them and therefore performable as trios. Contained within the Wighton Collection in Dundee is a manuscript of \\"Airs for Autumn\\" in the composer's own hand.

Prior to the discovery of Puijila, the five species in the genus Enaliarctos represented the oldest known pinniped fossils, having been recovered from late Oligocene and early Miocene (ca. 24–22 million years ago) strata of California and Oregon. Description E. emlongi and Macrodelphinus (background) It had a short tail and developed limbs with webbed feet. Unlike modern sea lions, it had a set of slicing carnassials; the presence of slicing teeth (rather than purely piercing teeth as in modern fish-eating pinnipeds) suggests that Enaliarctos needed to return to shore with prey items in order to masticate and ingest them. Still, Enaliarctos had some sea lion-like characteristics, such as large eyes, sensitive whiskers, and a specialized inner ear for hearing underwater. Evolution Enaliarctos has been heralded as the ancestor of all known pinnipeds, including the families Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Desmatophocidae (extinct seal convergent pinnipeds), Phocidae (true seals), and Odobenidae (walruses). Investigations of the biomechanics of Enaliarctos indicate that it used both its forelimbs and hindlimbs during swimming. Modern fur seals and sea lions only use their forelimbs, while true seals primarily use their hindlimbs for aquatic propulsion; lastly, the extant walrus uses both fore- and hindlimbs for swimming. It has been postulated that the condition in Enaliarctos is ancestral for all pinnipeds, and that forelimb swimming was lost in true seals, while hindlimb swimming was lost in fur seals and sea lions. This is significant because there has been considerable debate as to whether pinnipeds share common ancestry. Interpretation of Enaliarctos indicates that all pinnipeds share a common ancestor (which, if it was not Enaliarctos, must have been something very similar, such as the more newly discovered Puijila darwini, of controversial affinities, though). Enaliarctos emlongi is represented by fossils from coastal Oregon. It existed between 13 and 20 million years ago, during the Hemingfordian age of the Miocene epoch. It was named for renowned fossil collector Douglas Emlong in 1991 by paleontologist Annalisa Berta. Notes References * Berta, A., C.E. Ray and A.R. Wyss. 1989.

Stone (November 24, 1927 – December 22, 2014) was alderman of the 50th Ward of the City of Chicago, Illinois from 1973 to 2011. The 50th Ward encompasses part of Chicago's far North Side and includes the West Ridge, West Rogers Park and Peterson Park neighborhoods. First elected to the Council in 1973, Stone was the second longest-serving alderman (after Edward M. Burke). His tenure spanned the terms of seven Mayors, from Richard J. Daley to Richard M. Daley. Stone was also Vice Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1998 to 2011. Stone was a part of the \\"Vrdolyak 29\\", which opposed Mayor Harold Washington's agenda. Though he was a Democrat for most of his life, Stone briefly followed Alderman Edward Vrdolyak to the Republican Party, and unsuccessfully challenged Carol Moseley Braun for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone was a protagonist in a protracted legal conflict with the neighboring suburb of Evanston in 1993–1994. Employees of Stone's 2007 re- election campaign were convicted of vote fraud in 2010. Stone was \\"outspoken\\" and \\"relished the rough and tumble of politics\\". Early life and education Stone was born on November 24, 1927 in Chicago to Jewish immigrant parents. He was educated in the Chicago Public Schools system at Von Humboldt Elementary and Tuley High School, which is now Roberto Clemente Community Academy. Stone enlisted in the United States Army in 1945. Stone attended Wright Junior College, now known as Wilbur Wright College, and John Marshall Law School.  Early political career  =Early attempts at elected office= In 1956, Stone ran in the Democratic primary for the Illinois House of Representatives, but was defeated by Esther Saperstein, who went on to serve in the Illinois House for ten years and became Illinois' first female state senator. In 1963, Stone was one of a record 233 candidates filing to run for Chicago alderman, and one of ten challengers to the incumbent in the 50th Ward, Republican Alderman Jack I. Sperling, who sought a third four-year term. Stone filed without the endorsement of a political party. By February, 1963, Stone was not on the ballot for the February 26, 1963 election. =1973 campaign for alderman= On January 29, 1973, the Supreme Court of Illinois appointed Alderman Sperling to fill a vacancy as Cook County Circuit Court judge. The Chicago City Council called a special election for June 5, 1973 to fill vacant City Council seats, including the 50th Ward alderman seat. Stone was an employee in the office of Cook County Sheriff Richard Elrod and the vice president of the 50th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, which endorsed him for alderman. Stone was one of five candidates who filed to finish Sperling's term. Another candidate, independent Theodore Berland, was a medical writer and nationally recognized anti-noise activist who was chiefly responsible for Chicago's anti-noise ordinance. Stone organized the \\"Concerned Citizens of the 50th Ward\\" to counter neighboring Lincolnwood's opposition to a bridge over the North Shore Channel at Pratt Avenue, which Stone called a \\"necessity\\" for the 50th Ward. In the first round of voting, Stone led with 47% of the vote and Berland finished second, with 27%. In the run-off election on July 3, 1973, Stone defeated Berland 12,882 to 10,958, with a turnout of about 53%, winning the 50th Ward for Democrats for the first time since 1955.  Chicago City Council (1973–2011)  =The Republican years (1987–1990)= Former Alderman and former Cook County Democratic Party chairman Edward R. Vrdolyak converted to the Republican Party and encouraged Stone to follow suit and run for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. By threatening Republican Party of Cook County leadership that he would run for county Chairman and Cook County State's Attorney, Vrdolyak brokered a deal to slate himself for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County and Stone for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. On October 29, 1987, Stone announced he had joined the Republican Party and expressed his intention to run for Recorder. \\"I can no longer be part of a party that punishes law-abiding, tax-paying citizens and communities\\", Stone said, adding that he also felt \\"the Democratic Party is drifting away from America's historically strong commitment to Israel\\". HighBeam On November 25, 1987, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington died. Stone announced his candidacy for mayor to fellow aldermen on November 29 and to the public on December 1. Many saw Stone's mayoral candidacy as an attempt to publicize his Recorder race. Two days later the City Council elected Alderman Eugene Sawyer as mayor. In 1988, Stone ran as a Republican against African-American Democratic Illinois State Representative Carol Moseley Braun for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone told reporters that although he did not expect their newspapers' endorsements, \\"Just run a picture of Braun. That's all I ask\\". Stone included Braun's photograph in his campaign flyers. Stone was defeated by Braun and contributed to a sweep of Cook County offices by Democrats. In 1989, Stone unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Mayor of Chicago, to unseat Mayor Sawyer. Richard M. Daley defeated Sawyer in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Edward Vrdolyak in the general election to become mayor. In 1990, Stone returned to the Democratic Party. =\\"Berny's Wall\\"= Although resident and corporate relations between Chicago and neighboring suburb Evanston are generally cordial and co-operative, Stone was a protagonist in perhaps the most significant altercation in recent decades. The Evanston City Council adopted the Southwest II Tax Increment Financing (TIF) District, also called the Howard-Hartrey TIF, on April 27, 1992, in order to incent the development of a disused 23-acre Bell and Howell distribution center. A city contractor installed a $150,000, high, three- block-long, continuous steel guardrail down the middle of Howard Street, from Kedzie Avenue to California Avenue, blocking vehicles from crossing between Evanston and Chicago, to protect residents from the vehicular traffic expected at a proposed shopping center on the Evanston side of Howard Street that was projected to open in 1995. A Cook County Circuit Court judge denied Evanston's request for a restraining order to halt the erection of the barrier, which became known in the media as \\"Berny's Wall\\". The Chicago Tribune editorialized calling Stone \\"silly\\" and the guardrail a \\"senseless idea...just an insipid ploy by a useless alderman who has too much time on his hands and too much of the taxpayers' money at his disposal\\". On May 28, 1993, Evanston Mayor Lorraine H. Morton, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Stone, and city officials met at Chicago City Hall, and hours later, Morton announced that Evanston would drop legal action against Chicago. The next day, after consultation with Evanston's corporation counsel and others, Evanston announced they would continue legal recourse in conjunction with negotiations. Stone demanded that Evanston pick up the cost of the installation and removal of the guardrail. On June 1, 1993, the Evanston City Council voted to refuse to contribute funds, to continue their lawsuit, and to defer modifications to the site plan until the barrier was dismantled. Testimony began July 25, 1994. Chicago Transportation Commissioner Joseph Boyle Jr. and Planning Commissioner Valerie Jarrett testified that the guardrail had been installed at Stone's request without the benefit of traffic or planning studies. A partner of the shopping center's construction firm testified that Stone had discussed with him in 1992 the idea of siting the project on vacant land near the Lincoln Village Shopping Center, a site that was scheduled to be redistricted into the 50th Ward in 1995. Evanston officials said Stone was jealous of the project going to Evanston. On September 21, 1994, the judge ruled that the March 25, 1993 resolution which Stone ushered through the Chicago City Council authorized Chicago's Department of Transportation commissioner to consider a barrier, declared that the Department had no authority to install the guardrail, ordered Chicago to remove it and pay all costs including Evanston's legal fees, and dismissed Chicago's countersuit to block the shopping center. Chicago's request for a stay pending appeal was denied, Bell and Howell agreed to pay the estimated $35,000 to remove the barrier, and removal began on October 4, 1994. \\"The party isn't over until the fat man sings, and I'm the fat man\\", said Stone. The Chicago Tribune editorialized calling the barrier \\"a petty, indulgent waste of money at the people's expense\\". Stone passed legislation through the Chicago City Council to change to one-way, northbound only, portions of Kedzie and Sacramento Avenues, two Chicago streets south of the shopping center. After the changes were implemented November 10, 1994, Stone's office received numerous complaints, and by November 16 Kedzie was again a two-way street. On November 3, 1999, the City of Chicago established the Lincoln Avenue TIF district, including the Lincoln Village Shopping Center area. =Sleeping in Council Chambers= Chicago Alderman Bernard L. Stone (50th) at his desk in Chicago City Council Chambers, January 2004 A photograph of Stone asleep in Council Chambers, during a hearing on an ordinance restricting the use of a cell phone while operating an automobile, ran on the front page of the Chicago Sun-Times in January, 2004. \\"Some aldermen have a tendency while they're thinking to close their eyes and that may register with their constituency as not paying attention or, perhaps, even sleeping during the session\\", Stone later explained. Stone fell asleep at his desk in Council Chambers in City Hall during the City Council's Finance Committee debate on the controversial parking meter lease in December, 2008 and was photographed by the press. Stone was videotaped sleeping during a Finance Committee hearing on the transparency of the City's tax increment financing program in March, 2009. =Campaign employees convicted of vote fraud= On September 4, 2007, speaking from the floor of Council Chambers during a meeting of the Buildings Committee, Stone warned fellow aldermen of an ongoing investigation into absentee balloting. On January 28, 2008, two employees of Stone's 2007 re- election campaign were arrested and charged with improperly influencing voters, primarily from the ward's Indian and Pakistani communities, to vote absentee for Stone. Anish Eapen, a precinct captain and a ward superintendent with the city's Streets and Sanitation Department, was charged with \\"official misconduct, absentee ballot fraud, and mutilation of election materials\\". Eapen allegedly partnered with Armando Ramos, an unemployed student, who was also charged with absentee ballot fraud and mutilation of election materials. Stone accused the state attorney's office of acting at the behest of the area's U.S. Representative, Jan Schakowsky. \\"We know where this all started. We know it's politically based. ... Her [Schakowsky's] aide was soliciting the state's attorney to investigate. It's absolutely a devious political trick\\", he said. Schakowsky denied involvement. HighBeam Bond was set at $50,000 and $40,000 for Eapen and Ramos, respectively. City Inspector General David H. Hoffman called for Eapen to be fired. For nearly two years, Eapen was on paid administrative leave from his $83,940-a-year job with the city. On October 8, 2009, Streets and Sanitation Department Commissioner Tom Byrne found Eapen a job tracking equipment. Stone blamed Byrne's predecessor for Eapen's paid leave, saying \\"Mike Picardi has no cojones\\". On October 24, 2008, during the annual budget hearing process, Inspector General Hoffman testified before the Committee on the Budget of the Chicago City Council. \\"It is my intent, Mr. Inspector General, to wipe your entire office out of the budget\\", Stone told Hoffman. \\"It is my intent to submit a budget amendment which will destroy your department\\". \\"He's come after me, so I'm going after him. That's the way the game is played\\", Stone said. HighBeam Stone's amendment came before the Budget Committee on November 17, 2008 and was tabled 14-2. Eapen and Ramos waived their right to trial by jury. In a bench trial, four members of a family who lived in the ward testified that Eapen came to their homes, watched as they completed the absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots, collected their ballots, and mailed them. One family member, who was not registered to vote, testified that Eapen filled out her ballot and she signed it. Another witness testified that when she told Stone in his office that Ramos filled out her ballot, Stone was dismissive, saying, \\"This meeting is over\\". Stone commented on the testimony, \\"I have no recollection of what she is talking about\\". On June 24, 2010, Cook County Judge Marcus Salone found Eapen and Ramos each guilty on one count of attempted mutilation of voting materials and additional counts of attempted absentee ballot violations. On August 4, 2010, Salone sentenced Eapen and Ramos to prison terms of 364 days and 270 days, respectively. Salone said \\"I think the evidence is overwhelming. The reality is that Mr. Eapen and Mr. Ramos attempted to steal democracy and they did it in a vicious way\\". Stone called the case \\"a witch hunt\\", said that Ramos and Eapen were \\"political prisoners\\", and compared their crimes to \\"spitting on the sidewalk\\". Stone said Inspector General Hoffman targeted his staff while failing to investigate other aldermen's staffs. \\"They are not the ones who attempted to steal democracy. The one who attempted to steal democracy was David Hoffman\\", Stone said. \\"This is a miscarriage of justice\\". HighBeam =Committees= Stone was the Chairman of the City Council Committee on Buildings, and also served on the following City Council committees: Budget and Government Operations, Finance, Historical Landmark Preservation, Housing and Landmark Preservation, Traffic Control and Safety, and the Committee on Committees. Loss in 2011 run-off In 2008, Illinois State Senator Ira Silverstein defeated Stone in the voting for the 50th Ward Democratic committeeman, an unpaid party post. In February 2011, in a five-way race for alderman including Silverstein's wife, Certified Public Accountant Debra Silverstein, no candidate garnered 50% plus one of the vote, forcing a run- off. In the April 2011 run-off, Debra Silverstein prevailed with 62% of the vote to 38% for Stone. On election night, Stone said Silverstein would be \\"a disaster for this ward. There's no way I'll help her. She knows nothing\\". Stone's tenure as alderman spanned seven Chicago Mayors, including two Mayors Daley. Political philosophy Stone stated his political philosophy as \\"You take care of the people who take care of you – you know, the people who voted for you. That's not Chicago politics, that's Politics 101\\". Legacy In 2017 a 1.8 acre greenspace along the North Shore Channel just south of Devon Avenue in the 50th ward was dedicated Berny Stone Park. Personal life Stone married his wife, Lois (d. 1995), in 1949. They had three daughters and a son. HighBeam Stone worshipped at Congregation Ezras Israel and served on their Board of Directors. Stone also served on the Board of Directors for the Bernard Horwich Jewish Community Center, the Associated Talmud Torahs, and the Jewish National Fund. In 2003, Stone's son, Jay, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent 32nd Ward Alderman Theodore Matlak. Stone supported Matlak, calling his son \\"an embarrassment\\" who \\"doesn't know what he's doing\\". Father and son remained on good terms. Stone died on December 22, 2014 at age 87 from complications from a fall. Stone was remembered by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times as \\"outspoken\\"; by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as \\"fiercely loyal to his constituents\\"; and in a City Council resolution as \\"a vigorous advocate for the people of the 50th Ward\\".

The first occurrences of merengue in print in Venezuela are from scores of “dance merengue” of the second half of the 19th century. As a dance craze, merengue acquired popularity in Caracas during the 1920s. It is distinct from the vastly more popular Dominican merengue. Although they share the same name, the rhythms have very little in common, except that they were commonly written for partner dancing. History The origins of the word are controversial. For some people, the word merengue comes from the French word “meringue”, a confection made from whipped egg whites. However, this concoction is called suspiro in Venezuela. There is a stronger link to a Haitian popular dance with that name. Another theory links the name to African words like “muserengue” or “tamtam mouringue”. In Caracas, the term merengue rucaneao designated a way of dancing with couples holding and often featuring exaggerated hip movements (which added to the craze and subsequent controversy). Dances were paid affairs, with popular prices being “a locha” ( cents) or “a medio” (25 cents) in dance halls known then as mabiles. Live accompaniment consisted of four solo instruments: trumpet, trombone, saxophone and clarinet and rhythm instruments such as the cuatro, bass and percussion (which, depending on the size of the ensemble, could be as simple as a scraper, or incorporate maracas and even a snare drum) . Travelling groups known as cañoneros walked around the neighborhoods staging impromptu performances for tips. The name \\"cañoneros\\" comes from their marketing approach, which included firing a carbide charge from a blank cannon made of a thick, hollowed-out bamboo cane. Rhythmic structure right right There is no agreed way to properly notate the lilt of the Venezuelan Merengue. There are two main camps, or schools of thought, neither of which represents it properly: The most frequently used option is to designate a rhythm. The first half of the bar is written as an eighth-note triplet. The second half of the bar is written as two eighth notes. The unique swing in the second half is what gives Venezuelan merengue its lilt. Another approach is to notate the Venezuelan merengue as . This is the way that traditional musicians used to prefer it as the notation is less busy, but it assumes familiarity with the unique swing of Venezuelan merengue. Fredy Reyna proposed a third way in his cuatro method, Alfa Beta Cuatro, which consists of a bar. It has not been widely adopted. Regardless of notation, the juxtaposition of 3 against 2 is a very common theme that pervades Venezuelan music and is found in most of its forms, from joropo, to the myriad of Afro-Venezuelan drumming patterns. Venezuelan merengue today Venezuelan merengue is not quite the popular phenomenon that it was in the 1920s, but it still a popular dance, especially in Caracas. Several \\"nostalgia\\" groups attempt to preserve the form by performing it exclusively (often dressing in historic garb): Los Antaños del Stadium, Cañón Contigo, Los Cañoneros, Cuarteto Caraquita. Modern ensembles which incorporate Venezuelan merengues in their repertoire include: Grupo Raíces, El Cuarteto, Beto Valderrama, Henry Rubio, Luis Laguna, Ensamble Gurrufio. Formal musicians' contributions Despite, or perhaps because its popular origins, Merengue was embraced wholeheartedly by the vast majority of Venezuela's Nationalistic classical composers. Pianist-composer Teresa Carreño wrote several merengues, and incorporated the form as an interlude in some of her pieces (for example, in her piece entitled Un Bal en Rêve). Pianist- composer Moisés Moleiro also wrote and performed merengues in his classical repertoire, as did Evencio Castellanos. Saxophonist-composer Daniel Milano Mayora penned quite a few merengues, both for popular interpretation as well as virtuoso solo piano pieces. Guitarist-composer Antonio Lauro wrote what is believed to be the first piece in the form for solo classical guitar, simply entitled Merengue (1945). Rodrigo Riera composed his first merengue for solo guitar, entitled Merengue Venezolano in the 1950s. Later, he wrote many other merengues. Singer Jesús Sevillano included several merengues in his repertoire, during the height of his singing career. Contemporary Venezuelan formal musicians continue to cultivate and preserve the form. Jhibaro Rodriguez' (Maracay, 1971) arrangement of La Zapoara for solo guitar and León Zapata's (Caracas, 1955) composition entitled El Guaro are examples of Merengues written or arranged in the latter half of the 20th century. Venezuelan merengue outside of Venezuela Outside of Venezuela, Merengue simply did not catch on. Even on its heyday very few composers and bandleaders dedicated any effort to this form, maybe because of the difficult rhythm. Trinidadian Lionel Belasco composed, performed and recorded some Venezuelan Merengues and Waltzes between the 1910s and the 1930s. Venezuelan composer Aldemaro Romero had a shot in the 1950s with an international release that included several merengues, but didn't go very far in the charts. More recently, Paquito D'Rivera wrote a Merengue, again, simply titled Merengue Venezolano. Perhaps the best hope for the preservation of the form lies in the labor of active musicians that continue to compose, perform and teach merengue in other countries. Guitarist Aquiles Báez, multi-instrumentalist and educator Jackeline Rago, Canadian-based Ensemble Çavana, and the aforementioned Barradas and Gurrufío all are active practitioners of Venezuelan music worldwide.

The series was serialized in Shinshokan's manga magazine South between April 1998 and February 2001. The manga is licensed in English by Digital Manga Publishing and has been released in North America in 2006. Two drama CDs based on the series were produced, the first in July 2001 and the second in March 2002. The story mainly focuses around a boy who starts to live as a girl and how his group of friends changes due to his new lifestyle. Plot The Day of Revolution revolves around Kei Yoshikawa, a boy in high school who one day is informed that he is genetically female. This shocking realization causes his family to grow closer together and Kei decides that he is going to restart his life as a girl named Megumi. Megumi takes a six-month leave from school and returns as a first-year student with Makoto Yutaka, the niece of the doctor who aided in Kei's transition; Makoto also helps Megumi adjust to living life as a girl. Megumi is quickly found out by her old male friends who all start hitting on her once they discover the truth that she was Kei. Shocked at their new behavior, Megumi is appalled at the thought of ever dating any one of them or even getting a boyfriend. After a traumatic experience with a former enemy, she tells her friends that she has chosen Makoto instead of any of them, though they do not back down in their pursuits. Megumi, in an attempt to avoid her persistent male friends, starts spending more time at Makoto's house where she meets her younger brother Mikoto, who is home during the summer from an all-boys boarding school. Megumi starts to become more fond of Mikoto, though still only thinks of him as a younger brother, while at the same time Mikoto harbors feelings for Megumi. Megumi and Mikoto go on a date together but are interrupted by Megumi's male friends and Makoto. Megumi attempts to protect Mikoto from her friends' teasing of him, and in the process causes Mikoto to confess his love to her. Megumi and Mikoto begin dating though are still constantly interrupted and are thus unable to progress their relationship very far even two years later. However, they resolve to make progress together. Characters ; : :The main character, Kei was a rebellious boy in high school who would get into fights along with his three close friends. However, one day his doctor tells him and his parents that while Kei may appear to be physically male, he is in fact genetically female. He thus starts to live as a girl and even changes his name to Megumi, which uses the same kanji as 'Kei'. After the change in lifestyle, Megumi still has a problem with the transition from male to female. Even as Megumi dresses as a girl, she still feels more like a boy, and feels more comfortable when around Makoto. As a guy, he was often told he was cute, causing him to physically retaliate and retains much of the same personality after his transition. Megumi tends to be very outspoken and even blunt sometimes. :Megumi appears in the series Princess Princess, by the same author of The Day of Revolution, as Mikoto's girlfriend, though only references are made about her past life in the manga and nothing in the anime. In the manga, Megumi once fears that Mikoto had something with the other Princesses and that the only reason he is interested in her is because of her past life. ; : :Makoto is Megumi's best female friend who acts as a kind of coach to guide her through the process of becoming a typical girl. She teaches Megumi things such as feminine mannerisms, and speech patterns that only Japanese girls use. She was given this task because she is the niece to Kei's doctor and because she wants to become a counselor after high school. Makoto is very protective of Megumi, not wanting anything bad to happen to her. She has a very strong personality and uses it to command people around her however she likes. Makoto often uses this trait to coerce her younger brother, Mikoto, into doing things she wants him to do, whether they be for her own benefit or his own. :Like Megumi, Makoto also appears in the series Princess Princess as a minor character; she is still portrayed as Mikoto's sister. In the Princess Princess manga, once Megumi tells Makoto about her insecurities regarding Mikoto's sexual orientation, Makoto tells Megumi not to let him know that. Megumi thinks it is because it would hurt his feelings, but Makoto says that she does not want him to know how much Megumi loves him because it would make him happier. ; : :Mikoto is Makoto's younger brother who later becomes Megumi's boyfriend. He is a rather short guy who is in his second year at an all-boys junior high school. He is usually a very shy person but speaks out with much emotion. Ever since he entered junior high, he has been plagued by other students who treat him more like a girl than a guy due to his appearance and feminine face and is intensely embarrassed about this happening to him. He takes an early liking to Megumi by the pictures of her that are displayed at his house. Mikoto even takes a few of the pictures for himself, something his sister reminds him about later to the embarrassment of Mikoto. Eventually, he wants to become a doctor and take over the family hospital. :Mikoto appears in Mikiyo Tsuda's later work Princess Princess as one of the series' main characters and Princesses. The main reason he expresses to object being a Princess (aside from male pride) is the fear that Megumi will reject him if she finds out. ; : :Hiroaki Kawada is a former classmate of Kei's who eventually becomes the student council president. He has a lot of traits that fit well for a school president, such as forcefulness and being straightforward. ; : :Shuji Toba has a very lively personality and is one of Megumi's main friends. Back when Megumi was Kei, he would love to hug her, much to the detest of Kei. ; :Tadashi Tachimachi is also one of Megumi's close friends; he is usually very silent. He is also rather short, only a few centimeters taller than Megumi. ; : :Kazutoshi Shinmei is one of Megumi's friends that she knew as Kei. He constantly smiles and is shown to be the leader of Toba and Tachimachi. He can be very domineering and intimidating at times. ; :Taisei Nakagawa is a third-year student at the school who is at odds with Shinmei, Toba, Tachimachi and Kei since they took over the roof position at the top of the school. He is rather idiotic and does not always think up the best of plans on how to go about things. Also, he is the main reason Megumi starts to avoid guys after he assaults her one day. ; & :They are twin brothers who serve as the voice of reason for the otherwise idiotic Nakagawa. They always hang around with him and follow him as their leader.

Conservation The Ilha dos Lobos Ecological Reserve was created on 4 July 1983 by presidential decree with an area of . This was revoked and the island was reclassified as a wildlife refuge on 4 July 2005, the Refúgio de vida silvestre Ilha dos Lobos. The reserve was created to protect and monitor marine species, for research and environmental education. Fishing or landing on the reserve is prohibited.  Recreational use The island has started to attract surfers, who come by boat. They have found it is a giant point break with proper conditions for Tow-in surfing. Much of the effort to establish Ilha dos Lobos as an international class tow-in surf spot is credited to Torres Local Surf hero Zeca Scheffer, who died in a car crash in Dec 2006.

The city of Lüderitz is located at the edge of the bay. Geography The bay is indented and complex in structure. It opens to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. Lüderitz town is located in the southern shore of the inner eastern bay, which is known as Angra Pequena in Portuguese and opens towards the north. Further west Griffith Bay, a deep inlet, stretches southwards in the southern part. The bay west of 'Angra Point' is known as Shearwater Bay, the location of a proposed port for the export of amongst other things, coal from Botswana. This requires the construction of the 1600 km Trans Kalahari Railway.Railways Africa - Trans Kalahari Railway There are two islands facing Agate Beach in the northeastern part of the bay, Penguin Island and Seal Island. History The easternmost bay was named Angra Pequena when first mapped in 1487 by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, although in some maps it appeared as Angra de São Christóvão. In 1883 the bay area was made into a trading station by German trader Adolf Lüderitz. He renamed it Lüderitz and concluded treaties with the neighbouring chiefs, who ceded large tracts of country to the newcomers. Under the belief that Britain was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Lüderitz transferred his rights over the bay on 24 April 1884 to the German Imperial Government, and on the following 7 August Chancellor Otto von Bismarck proclaimed a German protectorate over the station and the surrounding area. Renamed Lüderitzbucht (Lüderitz Bay) by the Germans, the location then became a naval base for German South West Africa, modern day Namibia. The two islands off Agate Beach, rich in guano deposits, were annexed by Great Britain in 1867 and added to Cape Colony in 1874 as part of the offshore territory known as Penguin Islands.

He was Jay Leno's announcer on The Tonight Show from 1992 to 2004 and replaced Tonight Show announcer Ed McMahon after Johnny Carson's retirement. Hall introduced himself by saying, \\"...And me, I'm Edd Hall.\\" He left the show in March 2004. Early career Hall was born in Boston, Massachusetts, grew up in upstate New York, and attended Syracuse University. Best known as Jay Leno's announcer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 12 years, Hall started in show business at an early age.

He was also founder of the Arnotts department chain. Background Born in Auchtermuchty, Fife, he was the son of John Arnott and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Paton. Arnott arrived in Cork in 1837 to work at Grants of Patrick Street; he later opened his own shop which failed to prosper. After starting a business in Belfast which prospered he returned to Cork and opened a drapery store which he later expanded across Ireland and Britain, including Arnotts in Henry Street, Dublin and in Glasgow (where the name continued until the early-1990s). Career Among the other businesses he started or was involved in included Cash and Company Cork, Baldoyle and Cork Race Park Meetings, the City of Cork Steamship Company, Cork and Macroom Direct Railway, Passage Docks Shipbuilding Company, the Bristol General Steam Navigation Company and Arnotts Brewery Cork. He acquired the Irish Times and The Northern Whig newspapers, though he later disposed of the Whig over disputes relating to its editorial policy. His family retained a connection with the paper until the 1960s, although they had disposed of their interest earlier. Arnott was elected Lord Mayor of Cork three times, in 1859, 1860 and 1861. He was Justice of the Peace for Cork City and County and served as Member of Parliament for Kinsale between 1859 and 1863. Arnott was created a Knight Bachelor by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1859 and became a baronet, of Baily, in the County of Dublin on 12 February 1896. He was a philanthropist and was heavily involved into an investigation in the treatment of children at the Cork workhouse. In this period the Irish Poor Law Relief Bill was going through Parliament and he sat on the select committee. There is a plaque on St Patrick's Bridge in Cork that commemorates its opening by Arnott on 12 December 1861. He married Mary, the daughter of John James McKinlay. See Arnott baronets for his descendants. Arnott Street in Portobello, Dublin, is named for Arnott. In 1874, Arnott along with James Fitzgerald Lombard JP, a long-time director of Arnott's department store, and Edward McMahon purchased property in this area. Lombard Street West and McMahon Street were also eponymously named in this area.

It is the only Dutch hermitage currently inhabited by a hermit. The name draws upon the traditional epithet for the Virgin Mary (\\"Our Lady\\") of hortus conclusus or enclosed garden, a reference to the Song of Songs that indicates the Virgin's \\"perpetual virginity and at the same time her fruitful maternity\\". The hermitage was founded in 2001 as the dwelling of a Roman Catholic consecrated hermit. As is typical of Dutch hermitages, it includes a public chapel that has a distinct role in popular devotions, here to the Virgin Mary, also known as \\"Our Lady\\". It is the northernmost Marian shrine in the Netherlands. History The hermitage in Warfhuizen is a continuation of the tradition of hermits which arose in Limburg and North Brabant, following the Counter Reformation. The last brother of that tradition died in 1930 in de Schaelsberg hermitage in Valkenburg aan de Geul. Contrary to most hermitages abroad, these hermitages featured a public chapel which often played a part in local devotions. After a slow decline since the 1880s, the number of Roman Catholic hermits in Europe started to increase again towards the end of the 20th century, although the Netherlands did initially lag in this development. There have always been members of religious orders who lived as hermits, but the 'true hermits' became extinct after 1930. The old hermitages were left empty and mostly disappeared. This bothered some of the faithful. In 2001, the empty church of the village of Warfhuizen was acquired by Catholics and a simple hermit's dwelling was realised in the bay adjacent to the tower, which since then has been inhabited by a hermit (Brother Hugo). The rest of the building serves as a chapel. The hermit is part of the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden and has made his religious oaths to the bishop of that diocese. Since the Second Vatican Council revitalised the hermetic ideal, a small amount of new legislation has been created. The Code of Canon Law, can. 603, requires hermits to be more secluded than was the custom in the Netherlands. As a result, there is an enclosed area in Warfhuizen in which the hermit lives and works. In the chapel this is created by the large rood screen which separates the choir from the nave. Office and customs Similar to contemplative monasteries, the Office is kept in Warfhuizen. In the West, that is often prayed in accordance with the precepts of Saint Benedict, but in 2009, the hermit switched to the office of Saint John Cassian from the 5th century. Cassian based his schedule on the customs of the hermits in the Egyptian desert, the so-called Desert Fathers. As such, it is very suitable for hermits. Instead of the eight (usually short) offices of Benedict, Cassian prescribes two (longer) vigils, one at the start and one at the end of the night. In Warfhuizen, these vigils are sung softly in Latin. The other hours do not have an office with Psalms, but are prayed in silence by means of the Jesus Prayer. As such, the modern Warfhuizen office clearly deviates from that of the ancient Dutch hermits, who usually used a (shorter version of) the Liturgy of the Hours of Benedict. But the influence of the Limburgian tradition on the atmosphere in the hermitage remains clearly noticeable through the various additions from popular devotions, such as praying the Rosary and various litanies, which are sung at various moments during the day, out loud. The chapel's decorations also betray a continuation of 17th century examples, through Baroque elements. The devotion to Saint Gerlach of Houthem, of whom there is a reliquary in the retable of the right side altar, has a special place in the hermitage. Saint Anthony Abbot is also especially honoured. A relic of him is kept in the Holy Cross altar. In addition to the old southern tradition, there are also other influences on the liturgy. The fact that some of the volunteers are of the Russian Orthodox faith has led to the Jesus Prayer being sung (in Greek) after Compline. The Carthusian tradition is noticeable in the manner of executing Gregorian chant. =Eucharistic Adoration= Since May 2009, the bishop of Groningen-Leeuwarden has appointed the hermitage of Warfhuizen as a place where Eucharistic adoration could take place. Since then this, including the Rosary for pilgrims, takes place every day at 4 pm. Warfhuizen as a Marian pilgrimage site Most visitors to the chapel specifically come to venerate Mary. This began after a life-size processional statue, the 'Sorrowful mother of Warfhuizen', was placed in the chapel. The statue had such an appeal to faithful from the Netherlands and abroad that the chapel became a pilgrimage site.

A taxon of the family Desmatophocidae, it shares some morphological similarities with modern true seals.Ray, C. (1976). Fossil Marine Mammals of Oregon. Systematic Zoology, 25(4), 420-436. Two species are recognized: Desmatophoca oregonensis and Desmatophoca brachycephalaBerta, A. (1994). A New Species of Phocoid Pinniped Pinnarctidion from the Early Miocene of Oregon. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 14(3), 405-413.. Little information exists regarding Desmatophoca, due to the small number of fossil samples obtained and identified. Unlike modern pinnipeds, Desmatophoca did not survive into the Holocene. There is some scientific debate as to whether any Desmatophoca species may have been present in the Oligocene, but without fossil samples obtained from this era, this is based primarily on conjecture. All samples of fossil Desmatophoca were found in marine deposits in Washington and Oregon, in the USA, which could indicate a geographic range of what is now the Pacific Northwest. Description Despite sharing morphological similarities with extant true seals, Desmatophoca differ in unique and important ways. They had significantly shorter tails, and were likely much shorter overall than modern seals. Despite their small size compared with the seals of today, they had heavier, and likely more powerful jaws.Wortman, J. T. (1906). A new fossil seal from the marine Miocene of the Oregon coast region. Science, 24(603), 89-92). Because of this, it is likely they had a stronger bite force than any seal alive today, making them formidable hunters of their time. Like modern seals, they were carnivorous, and their large orbits indicate a sight-based hunting strategy. = Skull and dentition = Desmatophoca skulls are characterized with large orbits, indicating the carnivorous pinnipeds were likely hunters reliant on sight.Valenzuela-Toro, A. & N. Pyenson. (2019). What do we know about the fossil record of pinnipeds? A historiographical investigation. Royal Society Open Science, 6(11), 191394. Through comparisons with extant pinnipeds, Desmatophoca were determined to be either grip and tear feeders (biting prey and shaking it into smaller portions to consume) or pierce feeders (biting prey and using slight suction to draw it fully into the mouth). Desmatophoca mandibles are thick, and they possess wide coronoid processes; both of which provide jaw strength associated with grip and tear feeders.Kienle, S., & Berta, A. (2018). The evolution of feeding strategies in phocid seals (Pinnipedia, Phocidae). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 38(6), Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 02 November 2018, Vol.38(6). The thickness of the mandible is especially important, as it provides both high bite force and increased surface area for muscular attachment between the jaws, which allows for stronger mastication.Churchill, M., & M. Clementz. (2015). Functional Implications of Variation in Tooth Spacing and Crown Size in Pinnipedimorpha (Mammalia: Carnivora). The Anatomical Record, 298(5), 878-902. The extremely thick mandibles also serve as a diagnostic characteristic of this genus. Despite this evidence that indicates they may have been grip and tear feeders, Desmatophoca possess long tooth rows, which is characteristic of pierce feeders. But, they likely lacked the diagnostic small mastication muscles that would be present on a true pierce feeder. Because they have traits that would lend themselves to either strategy, it is still heavily debated which feeding strategy Desmatophoca utilized. Many agree it is likely the seals used some combination of pierce and rip and tear feeding, or potentially a new strategy not yet observed that served as a middle ground between the two. Desmatophoca have morphologically similar skulls to other predators of fish and squid, indicating this was the prominent makeup of their diet. However, it has been proposed that D. oregonensis were actually filter feeders, though their lack of diagnostic features (such as complex tooth cuspation and simple dentition). Further comparisons between Desmatophoca teeth with extant seals indicates they were a generalist species. A distinct diagnostic characteristic of Desmatophoca skulls is the unusually large and widely-spaced paraoccipital process, something not seen in modern carnivores. They also have a rudimentary postorbital process compared with extant seals and other Desmatophocidae.  Classification  Desmatophoca is the genus within the larger clade Desmatophocidae, which also contains the genus Allodesmus. Allodesmus and Desmatophoca are both monophyletic, and are closely related sister groups.Boessenecker, R. & Churchill M. (2018). The last of the desmatophocid seals: A new species of Allodesmus form the upper Miocene of Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 184(1), 211-235. The two genera both have large preoccipital processes, similar cranium shapes, and short rostrums. Desmatophoca is thought to be the more primitive of the two, lacking the two-rooted postcanine teeth and prenarial shelf of Allodesmus. Desmatophocidae have a close sister taxon as well, Phocidae, and both are found within the broad monophyly of Phocoidea.Berta, A., & R. J. Emry. (2002). The Miocene pinniped Desmatophoca oregonensis Condon, 1906 (Mammalia, Carnivora), from the Astoria Formation, Oregon. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, 93, 113-147. All members of Phocoidea, including Desmatophoca, share large orbits, bulbous cheektooth crowns, and expanded contact between the squamosal and the jugal.Fulton, T. & C. Strobeck. (2010). Multiple fossil calibrations, nuclear loci and mitochondrial genomes provide new insight into biogeography and divergence timing for true seals (Phocidae, Pinnipedia). Journal of Biogeography, 37(5), 814-829. The genus Desmatophoca consists of two known species: D. oregonensis (named for Oregon, the state it was discovered in) and D. brachycephala.  Discovery  The first Desmatophoca discovered was D. oregonensis, by Professor Thomas Condon in 1906, a year before his death. It was found in the middle Miocene layer of the Astoria Formation in Newport, Oregon. It was described and classified based solely off of a skull and partial jaw, and at the time, it helped shed light on the relationship between modern pinnipeds and other terrestrial carnivores. The use of D. oregonensis helped solidify the theory that modern seals evolved from terrestrial carnivores, and not the other way around. By comparing morphologies of D. oregonensis with extant terrestrial carnivores, it was determined that Desmatophoca shares a most recent common ancestor with bears and mustelids. This fossil sample also helped throw out the theory that seals share their most recent common ancestor with dogs and other canines, which was a popular thought at the time. The second species of Desmatophoca, D. brachycephala was discovered in 1987 by Barnes, in the late Miocene layer of the Astoria Formation that jetted into southwest Washington state. = Limitations = Because fossil Desmatophoca have only appeared from the same site, the Astoria Foundation in the Pacific Northwest, there is a bias in the data that has been collected. Additionally, few fossil Desmatophoca have been found and successfully categorized, meaning there is still much to be discovered about this species. In fact, of 388 instances of fossil pinniped species being identified successfully, only 5% of these samples belong to Desmatophocidae, comprising 11 species.

Manufactured by Intamin and situated in the Pioneer Frontier section of the park, the Accelerator Coaster opened to the public on May 8, 2004. It reaches a height of and catapults riders from 0 to in two seconds. Storm Runner features a top hat element, three inversions, a dual loading station and a magnetic braking system. In addition, it was designed to interact with three other Hersheypark rides: Dry Gulch Railroad, the Monorail, and Trailblazer. Storm Runner is the first accelerator coaster to utilize over-the-shoulder restraints and the first to have a dual-loading station with switch tracks. Likewise, it was also the first accelerator coaster to feature inversions; Kanonen at Liseberg was the second. History When Storm Runner first opened on May 8, 2004, the queue line would often be extended with ropes due to the ride's popularity. In 2005, the park added an overflow queue line located next to Trailblazer's first drop. In 2020, for reasons related to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, Storm Runner did not open for the summer season. Also that year, Storm Runner was the subject of litigation. A parent alleged that their 9-year old child was not properly secured and needed to escape from the ride while it was moving in the station. Ride experience As the train leaves the station, it moves slowly onto the launch platform. As it is rolling to its launch, a pre-recorded sound of a heartbeat is heard along with a voice announcing \\"All right, riders, sit up right with your head back, hold on tight to the grab handles at all times and keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times\\", followed by the whinny of a stallion. After a few seconds, the trains rolls back as the magnetic brakes drop and riders hear a voice saying \\"Now get ready, here we go\\", then the train suddenly launches from 0–72 mph in 2 seconds (just when he says the word \\"go\\"). Riders are then photographed by the on-ride camera a short way down the launch track. In 2004 during the wait, riders would listen to a heartbeat then a countdown from five before hearing the voice. After traveling down the take-off runway and hitting a speed of 72 mph, the train climbs straight up the 150-foot-tall \\"top hat\\" element providing some airtime, and back down again, dropping 180 feet, reaching the top speed of 75 mph down the side of a hill leading down toward Spring Creek. The train next climbs and rolls left through a \\"Cobra Loop\\". The train then speeds up and into a straight-line barrel roll which then leads to a \\"Flying Snake Dive\\" which consists of a heartline roll followed by a half Immelman roll that makes a vertical plunge back down toward Spring Creek. The train shoots back up and to within 10 feet under the park's Monorail track, over a portion of the TrailBlazer, quickly twists to the left and to the right, then back above the treetops for one last dose of airtime before descending onto the final brake run. From the brake run, the train makes a left turn back into the station. The duration of the ride is 28 seconds from launch to the brakes.

This system is similar to the propulsion on a locomotive wheel except it doesn't spin completely. The inner diameter of the wheel is attached to the hydraulic actuator and the outer radius of the wheel is then attached to the launch mechanism. The outer diameter of the wheel amplifies the energy output from the slow actuator stroke creating a high speed launch in a matter of seconds. A catch car is attached to the launch mechanism and the train attaches to this catch car prior to launch. Once the train reaches the end of the launch area, the pusher car disengages and gravity does the rest. The launch track features magnetic brake fins. These slow down the car in the event of a rollback. Storm Runner does not have a very tall top hat like Top Thrill Dragster or Kingda Ka, and usually does not have a problem clearing it. After a successful (although slightly rocky) first season, the ride's launch system is generally considered reliable. In video games Storm Runner is also a coaster available for construction in the video game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 with the Soaked! expansion pack.

They may have been a branch of the larger Roanoke people or allied with them.\\"Indian Towns and Buildings of Eastern North Carolina\\", Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, National Park Service, 2008, accessed 24 Apr 2010 The Croatan people of North Carolina who exist today live in Cumberland, Sampson, and Harnett counties predominantly. The Croatan lived in current Dare County, an area encompassing the Alligator River, Croatan Sound, Roanoke Island, Ocracoke Island, and parts of the Outer Banks, including Hatteras Island. Now extinct as a tribe, they were one of the Carolina Algonquian peoples, numerous at the time of English encounter in the 16th century. In 1580 Sir Walter Raleigh sent English explorers near what would be the Americas. That same time, the Croatan were living on the island of present-day Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. The Croatan people of North Carolina who are alive today live in Cumberland, Sampson, and Harnett counties. The Roanoke territory also extended to the mainland, where they had their chief town on the western shore of Croatan Sound. For the most part, the groups involved with the Croatan Indians were small. Even though the majority of these groups were small, they did have about 30 groups that consisted of 100 plus members in 1930. The Croatan Indians also had a group in Robeson County N.C that had nearly 15,000 members. Croatan Americans were a part of the Carolina Algonquians, a southeastern designation of the greater Algonquian source. Agriculture was the Native Americans' primary food source, and the fact that they could feed the colonists, as well as themselves, demonstrates very effectively the efficiency of their farming. The Native Americans regulated each person's position in society by public marks. The chiefs or leaders, called werowances, controlled between one and eighteen towns. The greatest were able to muster seven or eight hundred fighting men. The English marveled at the great awe in which these werowances were held, saying no people in the world carried more respect towards their leaders. Werowance means \\"he who is rich\\". Chiefs and their families were held in great status and with respect, but they had to convince followers that action or cause was wise, they did not command. The role of the chief was to spread the wealth to his tribe, otherwise, respect was lost. The legislature on June 30, 1914 declared a thorough investigation to decide what tribal right the \\"Cherokees\\" formerly known Croatan Indians of North Carolina had. The Croatan Indians were granted rights which enabled them to be designated and known as \\"Croatan Indians\\". They were also granted the right of \\"Indians and their descendants shall have separate school for their children, school committees of their own race, and shall also have the right to choose their own teachers based upon the General assembly of North Carolina. A scholar of Algonquian linguistics has suggested that the word \\"Croatan\\" means \\"council town\\" or \\"talk town,\\" which likely indicates the residence of an important leader and a place where councils were held. They fished along the northern Outer Banks, but most of their fields and towns were in present day Buxton and Hatteras. Descendants of the Croatan are known as the Lumbee tribe. In 1880 they tried to obtain Indian tribal recognition. The state acknowledged them as a tribe, but they could not be recognized by the federal government due to mingling and mixing from other tribes. (Powell)  Beliefs  The Native Americans living in the Carolinas believed in the immortality of the soul. Upon death, the soul either enters heaven to live with the gods or goes to a place near the setting sun called Popogusso, to burn for eternity in a huge pit of fire. The concept of heaven and hell was used on the common people to respect leaders and live a life that would be beneficial to them in the afterlife. Conjurors and priests were distinctive spiritual leaders. Priests were chosen for their knowledge and wisdom and were leaders of the organized religion. Conjurors, on the other hand, were chosen for their magical abilities. Conjurors were thought to have powers from a personal connection with a supernatural being (mostly spirits from the animal world).  European colonization  It is known that the arrival of English Settlers upset some pre-existing tribal relationships. The Algonquian people advocated cooperation while others (the Yamasee, Cherokee and Chickasaw, for example) resisted. Later, this conflict between tribes and settlers would lead to the Yamasee War. Tribes that maintained mutually beneficial contact with the settlers gained power through their access to and control of European trade goods. While the English may have held great military superiority over the Carolina Algonquians, the Native Americans' control over food and natural resources was a much more decisive factor in the conflict with early settlers. Despite the varying relationships among tribes, the Roanoke and Croatan were believed to have been on very good terms with English Settlers of the Roanoke Colony. Wanchese, the last leader of the Roanoke, accompanied the English on a trip to England.  The Lost Colony  Roanoke in 1590 to find the word \\"Croatoan\\" carved on a tree. Some of the survivors of the Lost Colony of Roanoke may have joined the Croatan. Governor White finally reached Roanoke Island on August 18, 1590, three years after he had last seen them there, but he found his colony had been long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and \\"the houses [were] taken down\\". The few clues about the colonists' whereabouts included the letters \\"CROATOAN\\" carved into a tree. Croatoan was the name of a nearby island (likely modern-day Hatteras Island) in addition to the local tribe of Native Americans. Roanoke Island was not originally the planned location for the colony and the idea of moving elsewhere had been discussed. Before the Governor's departure, he and the colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if they had moved and would include an image of a Maltese Cross if the decision was made by force. White found no such cross and was hopeful that his family was still alive. The Croatan, like other Carolina Algonquians, suffered from epidemics of infectious disease, such as smallpox in 1598. These greatly reduced the tribe's numbers and left them subject to colonial pressure. They are believed to have become extinct as a tribe by the early seventeenth century.  Speculation of the fate of the \\"Lost Colony\\"  Based on legend, some people said that the Lumbee tribe, based in North Carolina, were descendants of the Croatan and survivors of the Lost Colony of Roanoke Island. For over a hundred years, historians and other scholars have been examining the question of Lumbee origin. Although there have been many explanations and conjectures, two theories persist. In 1885, Hamilton McMillan, a local historian, and state legislator proposed the \\"Lost Colony\\" theory. Based upon oral tradition among the Lumbees and what he deemed as strong circumstantial evidence, McMillan posited a connection between the Lumbees and the early English colonists who settled on Roanoke Island in 1587 and the Algonquian tribes (Croatan included) who inhabited coastal North Carolina at the same time. According to historical accounts, the colonists mysteriously disappeared soon after they settled, leaving little evidence of their destination or fate. McMillan's hypothesis, which was also supported by the historian Stephen Weeks, contends that the colonists migrated with the Indians toward the interior of North Carolina, and by 1650 had settled along the banks of the Lumber. It is suggested the present-day Lumbees are the descendants of these two groups. Other scholars believe the Lumbees to be descended from an eastern Siouan group called the Cheraws. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several Siouan- speaking tribes occupied southeastern North Carolina. John R. Swanton, a pioneering ethnologist at the Smithsonian Institution, wrote in 1938 that the Lumbees were probably of Cheraw descent but were also genealogically influenced by other Siouan tribes in the area. Contemporary historians such as James Merrell and William Sturtevant confirm this theory by suggesting that the Cheraws, along with survivors of other tribes whose populations had been devastated by warfare and disease, found refuge from both aggressive settlers and hostile tribes in the Robeson County swamps in eastern North Carolina.Encyclopedia of North American Indians, Houghton Mifflin Late twentieth-century research has demonstrated that among surnames established as Lumbee ancestors were numerous mixed-race African Americans free in Virginia before the American Revolution, and their descendants who migrated to Virginia and North Carolina frontiers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These \\"free people of color\\" were mostly descendants of European women and African men, who worked and lived together in colonial Virginia. These connections have been traced for numerous individuals and families through court records, land deeds and other existing historical documents. In Robeson County, they may have intermarried with Native American survivors and acculturated as Native Americans. Modern era and legacy The Lost Colony Center for Science and Research has excavated English artifacts within the territory of the former Croatan tribe. The artifacts may also be evidence of trade with the tribe, or of natives finding them at the former colony site. The Center is conducting a DNA study to try to determine if there are European lines among Croatan descendants. In 1890 a group of about 100 Croatan Indians left Robeson County N.C, for South Georgia. By building a church and school for their people they established themselves in a time where racial barriers were very distinct between \\"black\\" and \\"white\\". The Croatan people Instead considered themselves as \\"Indians\\". The South as a whole tried to force them into segregation, but the Croatan people of Bulloch County wanted no part of it. Instead of obeying the people of the south they headed back to Bulloch County where they could keep their people together as \\"Indians\\". The Croatan Indians established themselves in a place that was not home to them. It was unheard of for Indians to hold an identity in this way. They used the segregation of Jim Crow South to develop themselves as an entire community. In 1910, the North Carolina state legislature renamed the Croatan Indians in North Carolina to \\"Cherokee\\" and designated them a branch of the Cherokee Nation.http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/mcpherson/mcpherson.html A historical marker placed by the state of Georgia states \\"In 1870 a group of Croatan natives migrated from their homes in Robeson County, North Carolina, following the turpentine industry to southeast Georgia. Eventually, many of the Croatans became tenant farmers for the Adabelle Trading Company, growing cotton and tobacco. The Croatan community established the Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Adabelle, as well as a school and a nearby cemetery. After the collapse of the Adabelle Trading Company, the Croatans faced both economic hardship and social injustice. As a result, most members of the community returned to North Carolina by 1920.\\"http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bulloch/croatan- indian-community Researchers from the University of Bristol, UK have also been excavating on Hatteras Island in conjunction with the Croatoan Archaeological Society. Hatteras Island is the main locus for the settlement of the Croatoan tribe, and to date, they have discovered a large contact/pre-contact period settlement, midden deposits and European trade items.

It is situated close to the village of Wremen. History The station was opened in 1896 as part of the extension from the Bremen to Bremerhaven line toward Cuxhaven. It has been a minor station during its whole existence, as the single-track line toward Cuxhaven allowed for crossings at Dorum railway station only. South of it, in the village of Imsum, used to be another, similarly minor station. However it was closed and removed in the late 1970s. The Bremerhaven-Speckenbüttel railway station, south of Imsum, was closed in 1988, so Wremen is a notable distance north of the next station currently in operation. Ever since the advent of the motorcar, the station mainly serves commuters into Bremerhaven and tourists. At some point even international InterRegio trains to Luxembourg and Saarbrücken called at the station, though this service was removed in the late 1990s. Train services The following services currently call at the station:Timetables for Wremen station *Local services Cuxhaven - Dorum - Bremerhaven - Bremervörde - Buxtehude Operational usage The station today is a very minor station, as all buildings have been scrapped in the 1960s and 1970s, it has since been reduced to the status of a stop. It underwent some renovation in the early 2000s (decade) to bring its sub-standard platform up to par; when InterRegio trains to Luxembourg were still calling at the station (mainly for tourist reasons), the passengers had to deal with a height difference of 85 centimetres between car floor and platform. Today, EVB services call at the station in varying intervals, usually hourly during weekdays.

Fossils of Imagotaria are known from the early late Miocene of California (c. 10-12 million years ago). Description The long pinniped more closely resembled in its overall shape a sea lion rather than a walrus. Unlike the extant walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), Imagotaria did not possess elongate, ever-growing tusks, but instead bore enlarged canines (with respect to other pinnipeds). Imagotaria is an example of a primitive walrus that does not grossly appear similar to a modern walrus. However, the walrus family (the Odobenidae) is a more inclusive group, that includes walruses without tusks (e.g. Imagotaria), walruses with upper and lower tusks (the subfamily Dusignathinae), and walruses with upper tusks like the extant walrus (subfamily Odobeninae, tribe Odobenini). It is possible to classify these pinnipeds as walruses because they share many other skull features (besides tusks) as well as many skeletal features, all of which indicate common ancestry. Palaeobiology The teeth of Imagotaria indicate that its feeding ecology was markedly different from that of modern walrus, and more similar to that of less specialized pinnipeds like seals, fur seals, and sea lions. Conical, unworn teeth and the lack of a vaulted palate indicate that Imagotaria did not feed on molluscs like modern walrus. Modern walruses do not use their teeth to chew molluscs like sea otters do. Instead, they hold a clam in their lips, and the vaulted palate allows them to use their tongue as a powerful piston to suck the soft parts right out of the clam shell. The shell is then dropped to the seafloor, never entering the oral cavity. Additionally, fossils of Imagotaria (and the earlier Neotherium, c. 15 million years ago) demonstrate that early walruses had, by the middle and late Miocene, already developed extreme sexual dimorphism (males and females having different body sizes). It is unclear whether extreme sexual dimorphism is ancestral to all pinnipeds, or if it has been independently acquired in multiple pinniped lineages.

Its original purpose was to demonstrate better breeding and feeding techniques to area stockmen. The founders included Elias M. Ammons, president of the Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association and later governor of Colorado; George Ballentine, general manager of the Denver Union Stock Yard Company; and Fred P. Johnson, publisher of the Record Stockman. Since first held in 1906, it has become the world's largest stock show by number of animals and offers the world's only carload and pen cattle show. Quarter Horses at the National Western Stock Show, Circa 1950 Originally limited to the livestock from the western United States, the show was expanded by 1908 to include entrants from around the world. A horse show was included as an annual event in 1908, and a rodeo was added in 1931. By 1925, an event for 4-H, the 4-H Roundup, was also held in conjunction with the stock show. By 1981 the organization owned numerous buildings, more than twenty acres of stockyards, several acres of parking, and total assets of about five million dollars.

Known as a residential area for actors and other people in the motion-picture industry, it is divided between a hillside single-family district and an apartment area. It is notable for an attempt by its homeowners' group and the city to close off public streets to outside traffic, an effort that was ruled illegal by the courts. Geography The preservation zone is split into two parts by the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Highway 101) running through the Cahuenga Pass. Streets within the zone's northern part are a one-block portion of Cahuenga Boulevard, Iris Drive, and some of Whitley Avenue; it consists almost exclusively of single-family homes. The southern zone, about 80% of the original plot, embraces Fairfield Avenue, Wedgewood Place, Whitley Avenue, Cerritos Place, Hollyhill Terrace, Grace Avenue, Emmet Terrace, Las Palmas Avenue, and Milner Road, and is almost exclusively zoned for apartments. It is within walking distance of the Hollywood Bowl, and Hollywood Boulevard is nearby. History =Early days= Hobart J. Whitley bought the hillside area in 1901 and 1903, and hired architect Arthur Barnes to build houses in a Mediterranean style he thought would suit Southern California's climate. Five years later, Whitley Heights was seen as a \\"magnificent hill of forty acres situated in the very center of Hollywood and overlooking the entire city.\\" On June 30, 1907, a fire kindled by a resident at the foot of the hill swept over the land, which was covered by a heavy growth of wild mustard and barley, and destroyed \\"many rare and valuable trees and shrubs\\" Whitley had planted. It threatened a large reservoir owned by the United Hollywood Water Company atop the rise and burned several tons of hay. The fire was quenched the same day by the volunteer Hollywood fire department headed by E. Fossler. As a contemporary account noted, \\"This hill has been one of the show places of Hollywood for some time. Here. Mr. Whitley intends erecting a handsome home at some future date, and toward this end, he has cultivated and beautified the grounds, laying them out in winding roads and planting a great variety of rare trees and shrubs, some of which were imported from the Hawaiian Islands and Mexico.\\" Whitley had sold some of his land for one dollar to the water company for the reservoir about 1904 and bought it back 16 years later at a cost of $30,000. In 1918, Whitley commissioned architect A.S. Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean village on the steep hillsides above Hollywood Boulevard. Whitley sent Barnes to tour the Mediterranean area to study its architecture and landscaping of Italy's historic hill towns before returning to the Southland, where he designed most of the Whitley Heights houses between 1918 and 1928. The development grew during the 1920s, and it became the first Hollywood celebrity community. City of Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources The streets in the development were dedicated to public use in 1920 and 1921, and they were improved by the city between 1924 and 1927. Most of them had no sidewalks, with stairways built from level to level to encourage walking. On the evening of June 23, 1920, the residential subdivision of Whitley Heights was opened with a festive barbecue that gathered an assemblage of businessmen and politicians. \\"The occasion was attended with a special significance as it was the scene of a reunion of many men who were connected with Mr. Whitley in his first efforts to make the vegetable gardens into a wealthy city more than twenty years ago, men who had gathered at a similar affair in 1902 to watch the turning on of the first electric lights in Hollywood,\\" wrote The Times. The subdivision already had several homes on the terraces that divided the hill into four grades. Three years later, in 1923, the Whitley Heights Civic Association was founded. =Preservation zone= In 1982, Whitley Heights was made a state historic district by the California Historical Resources Commission after research done by actor Brian Moore, president of Whitley Heights Homeowners. Moore traced property titles in the area, gathered old photographs and articles, and read through the papers of Hobart J. Whitley, which were housed in the special collections library at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was impelled to begin his research in 1981 after a bungalow was demolished by a developer who wanted to build tract homes. To qualify for the designation, an area had to be at least 50 years old and retain many of its original characteristics. At the time almost all of the homes, with their red tile roofs, balconies, and arched windows and doorways, were original.\\"Area Was Home to Stars of '20s: Whitley Heights Wins Historic Status,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1982, page WS-1 Later, the district was also made a national historic place, the first such in Hollywood. In 2004, the area was made into a Los Angeles historic preservation overlay zone. =Street closure= Over time, the placid nature of Whitley Heights and its 168 homes changed. In April 1983, the Whitley Heights Civic Association was incensed at a developer's plans to build an apartment complex on Las Palmas Avenue, which stirred up a community surge on behalf of fencing off streets around the neighborhood as protection against what one resident called \\"animal people\\" who walked up the hill to burglarize homes. By 1985, there were burglaries, assaults, vandalism, and car thefts. Prostitutes came up from nearby Hollywood Boulevard to work in parked cars, and the area extending north from Hollywood Boulevard into Whitley Heights had the highest crime rate in Hollywood. For four years, residents had been beseeching the city to approve the installation of 10 gates across the public streets leading into the community, and in May 1985, the Public Works Committee of the City Council agreed with the area's city council representative, Peggy Stevenson, and recommended that streets to the enclave be closed to non-residents. In 1991, the city issued a permit to the Whitley Heights Civic Association to allow the installation of gates that would turn the community into a private enclave. Construction, funded by Whitley Heights homeowners, began in January 1991 and was substantially completed by April 1992, at a cost of more than $350,000. Construction was permanently halted in 1992 when a group called Citizens Against Gated Enclaves successfully sued to prevent the closure of public roadways in Whitley Heights. The trial court held that state law prohibited the city from withdrawing a street from public use in that fashion. An appellate court agreed, and the end result was that the gates were removed at the expense of the Whitley Heights homeowners and the streets put back in good repair at the expense of the city, with all court costs paid by the defendants. Notable houses Construction of the Hollywood Freeway through the district resulted in the destruction of 49 houses, including those where actors Rudolph Valentino and Charlie Chaplin had lived. A home belonging to actress Bette Davis was destroyed in the early 1960s for a proposed Hollywood museum that was never built. * Villa Vallambrosia is a three-story residence built in 1929 by Eleanor DeWitt, who was described by Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith as a \\"wealthy and fastidious widow.\\" Smith wrote: \\"Like most of the houses in Whitley Heights, it is … a collection of rooms and courtyards of various shapes and levels, fitted to the steep hillside.\\" The architect was Nathaniel Coleman, who had been sent abroad to study Italian architecture and who modeled the house after a villa on the Grand Canal in Venice. In its three stories it had a \\"concave facade, a five- sided filigreed balcony and an interior courtyard with a fireplace and fountain. * The home of actors Patrick Bauchau and Mijanou Bardot was featured in a 2003 book, Secret Gardens of Hollywood and Private Oases in Los Angeles, in which author Erica Lennard wrote, \\"Their yard, abundant with fruit trees — olive, lemon, pomegranate, guava, fig — and bamboo, jasmine, lavender, passionflowers, was too seductive to leave.\\" In 1999, Bauchau had run afoul of the wishes of a local Historical Preservation Zone review board, which ordered him to cut back the overgrown foliage at the front of his property because it was shrouding the view of his house and the look was not in keeping with the original atmosphere of Whitley Heights from the 1920s.

Early life According to court documents, Denovo had changed her name from Laura Miller; she had run away from Lexington, Kentucky. She had been committed to a mental hospital by her parents when she was 14 after a history of discipline issues in school, and was released after 10 months of treatment. She was again confined in 1989, but escaped in September 1990 and hitchhiked to Berkeley by late 1990 via Portland, Oregon. At one point, Denovo was squatting in a house at 2628 Regent Street in Berkeley; coincidentally, the cottage (at 2628A Regent) behind it was where Theodore Kaczynski lived in 1968 while teaching mathematics at Berkeley from 1968–69. Other sources claim Denovo lived in the cottage, not the house. Activism In July and August 1991, protests erupted at People's Park in Berkeley, California over the construction of beach volleyball courts on the site; although the site belonged to the University, it had remained vacant since the Bloody Thursday riot of May 15, 1969, after it had been cleared in 1968 for student housing that was never built. Denovo had been involved in those 1991 riots, leading to her arrest that summer for trespassing and vandalism on campus property, and for carrying concealed weapons and attacking police officers at the People's Park protests. On July 31, 1991, Denovo, her boyfriend, and a transient they had befriended were arrested while hiding in bushes near University House, the Chancellor's residence. They were cited for prowling and released; according to the transient, they had gone to \\"find the chancellor's house to see how to get inside it to blow it up.\\" After Denovo was arrested again on August 8, 1991, article continuation police searched a campsite where she was living with a boyfriend in the Berkeley hills, and discovered explosive devices and a list of potential targets, including several university officials. The couple also possessed crossbows, arrows, a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook (which contains instructions for making homemade bombs), and a journal tied to her that made threatening references to Chancellor Tien. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, a diary entry dated June 25, 1991 read \\"Tien, you're not getting off that easy. Man, I want to destroy something.\\" Her trial was pending on the 1991 explosives possession charges at the time of her death. In total, Denovo had been arrested or questioned more than a dozen times in the year prior to her death. =Break-in and death= University House (2006) On August 25, 1992, Denovo broke into the basement of University House, the residence of Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien on the UC Berkeley campus at 5:51 am, using a blow torch to cut through bars securing a window. This triggered a silent alarm that summoned the University of California Police Department (UCPD); while enroute, the UCPD woke the Chancellor and his wife with a phone call, warning them to lock their bedroom door. Onsite, officers from the UCPD and the Oakland Police Department (OPD) spotted Denovo through a window and demanded she surrender; she fled into the house instead. The OPD had been called in to assist. After the responding officers escorted Tien and his wife safely off the premises, OPD police officers with dogs entered the house, where one shot and killed Denovo. Denovo was carrying a note demanding an end to the construction in People's Park; it read, in part: \\"We are willing to die for this piece of land. Are you?\\" According to UCPD Chief Victoria Harrison, canine patrol officer Craig Chew of the OPD shot Denovo three times in self- defense after she lunged at Chew with a machete. Chew had previously been shot five times in July 1991 by a teenage robbery suspect during an investigation in Temescal, and had just returned to duty in July 1992. In addition, Chew had been investigated three times in 1989 for the use of excessive force during his tenure with the Berkeley Police Department, where he served prior to joining the OPD in 1990. Response and legacy Several protests over Denovo's death were made in the week following the shooting. According to her parents, who had come to visit Denovo in July 1992, she had been planning to enroll at Berkeley. Although the Office of the Alameda County District Attorney determined the police had acted appropriately in a report released in October, park activists and street people doubted the use of deadly force was justified. According to the autopsy report, Denovo was shot at least once in the back; UCPD Chief Victoria Harrison theorized that Denovo may have continued to twist around after she swung the machete at Officer Chew, presenting her back during that shot. The city of Berkeley began to renovate People's Park in 1995, following a resolution to ensure cooperation with the University that unanimously passed the city council. The volleyball courts at People's Park were removed in 1997. That year, Steven Starr and Patrick Dillon completed their screenplay for a film entitled A.K.A. Rosebud; Natalie Portman and Monica Keena performed read-throughs (Keena, at the Nuyorican Poets Café) for the lead role. A copy of the synopsis and research for the screenplay is held in the Amos Poe Papers collection of the Fales Library at New York University.

Pourtout. Between two World Wars Georges Irat MDU The company's first product was an ohv 1990cc four-cylinder car designed by Maurice Gaultier who had been with Delage. This was joined in 1926 by a 2985 cc six-cylinder. The company turned to producing Lycoming powered models in 1929, both sixes and eights; this was also the year in which they moved from Chatou to Neuilly. A small car with 1086 cc four-cylinder engine and designed by George's son Michel, was added to the range in 1929 but sales of this and the large cars were poor resulting in a financial crisis. The manufacturer was partially taken over by Godefroy et Levecque, makers of the Ruby engine, in 1934, consequently moving to that company's works in Levallois. Here they made two front-wheel-drive sporting roadsters, one with an 1100 cc Ruby and the other with a six-cylinder 2450 cc Lycoming engine. The smaller car sold well but there were few takers for the six. In 1938 a new sports car with a 1911 cc engine produced by Citroën with independent suspension using rubber springing on all wheels was announced but war broke out after about 200 had been made. During the Second World War After the outbreak of war, Georges Irat was among the first auto-makers to focus on electric cars, there being diminishing quantities of oil based motor-fuel available for civilian use, especially after the German invasion in May/June 1940. An all-new electric car was designed during Summer 1940 and developed rapidly in order to be ready for public launch at the Lyon Fair during the autumn of 1941. The little car was designed to be as light-weight as possible and the electric motor had a number of ingenious features. The vehicle had a top speed of 30–35 km/h (roughly 20 mph) and the lead battery provided for a range of 90-100 kilometres (nearly 60 miles) between charges. Both a small 2-seater cabriolet and a 2-seater mini-van were produced, although most of the rear portion of the car and indeed of the van was permanently occupied by the electric motor and batteries. The first few cars were produced for use by Georges Irat employees, but small batches of the cars were built for sale via an exclusive deal with a car dealer on the Rue de Passy on the western side of central Paris. After the end of 1942 significant levels of auto-production were no longer possible due to the non-availability of materials and labour for civilian production. Production of electric cars did not restart when peace returned in 1945. After the Second World War Voiture du Bled (VDB) A prototype with an 1100 cc flat four engine driving the front wheels was shown at the October 1946 Paris Salon. It reappeared at the 1947 Motor Show looking broadly similar but the front panels were slightly reworked and the headlights were covered over with an extra layer of glass in order to present a smoother profile. Under the bonnet/hood the engine had now been replaced by a 1996 cc 4-cylinder in-line unit featuring a twin overhead camshaft and driving, now, the rear wheels via a more conventional transmission. At this time the French auto-industry was subject to extensive government intervention, and in this dirigiste context Georges Irat thought that the larger-engined car might be classified by the government, which controlled supplies of materials necessary for auto-production, as an \\"exceptional car reserved in the first instance for export\\" ... parmi les \\"véhicles d'exception réservés en priorité a l'exportation\\" However, the car never entered production even though it re- appeared at the 1949 show. In 1950 Georges Irat announced the VdB or \\"Voiture du Bled\\" made by a new company, Société Chérifienne George Irat in Casablanca, Morocco. This was a jeep-like three-seat vehicle powered by a rear-mounted Panhard engine. Only a few were made up to 1953. The engine was originally of 610 cc and , which meant a top speed of . It could climb a 40% grade and ford a deep stream. The vehicle later received updated bodywork, and the car displayed at the 1953 Paris Show had a 745 cc version of the Panhard engine, producing . With and in reserve, the effective range of the VdB was . It was rear-wheel drive only, but had a locking differential and a low gear transfer case for its three-speed gearbox.

Family and early life  Sherwood was born in Augusta Township in 1811, the son of Levius Peters Sherwood and Charlotte (Jones) Sherwood. He was of United Empire Loyalist stock on both sides of his family.The Canadian biographical dictionary and portrait gallery of eminent and self-made men: Ontario Volume, (Toronto: American Biographical Publishing Co., 1880), pp. 235–236. His older brother, Henry Sherwood, later became Joint Premier of the Province of Canada. George Sherwood studied law and was called to the bar in 1833, as a barrister at law. The same year he married Marianne Keegan, originally from Nova Scotia. He set up practice in Prescott, originally in partnership with his brother Henry.  Later career  Elected a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1849, Sherwood was named Queen's Counsel in 1856. A member of the Church of England, Sherwood donated land valued at ₤25 for the foundation of Trinity College, an Anglican college in Toronto.Henry Melville, The Rise and Progress of Trinity College, Toronto (Toronto: Henry Rowsell, 1852), p. 94. Sherwood was an officer in the local militia, and eventually reached the position of lieutenant-colonel, commanding the 1st Battalion of the Leeds militia. He was also a director of the Brockville and Ottawa Railway.Henry J. Morgan, The Canadian Parliamentary Companion, 2nd ed. (Quebec: Desbarats & Derbishire, 1863), p. 73. In his later years, Sherwood was a warden of the Anglican church in Brockville.  Political career  The Sherwoods were part of the Family Compact, the inter- connected families of strong British and Loyalist sympathies which dominated the government of Upper Canada in the early years of the 19th century. When he first entered politics in the general election of 1841, George Sherwood was associated with the Upper Canada Tories. Although he supported the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the new Province of Canada, he was a critic of the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, in the 1841 election.Paul G. Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada, 1841-67 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962; reprinted in paperback 2015), pp. 93-94. The Tories disagreed with the Governor General's policy of seeking a broad-base of support in the Legislative Assembly, including Reformers, rather than drawing support solely from the Family Compact, as previous governors of Upper Canada had done. Sherwood successfully stood for election for the electoral district of Brockville in the 1841 general election for the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada. He was re-elected in the elections of 1844 and 1848, but defeated in the general elections of 1851 and 1854. He was re-elected in the general election of 1857 and served in Parliament until 1863. In 1845, Sherwood was appointed a commissioner to review the management of public works in the Province. By 1858 he was a supporter of the Liberal-Conservative party, and entered Cabinet that year in the John A. Macdonald–George-Étienne Cartier ministry. He served from 1858 to 1862 as Receiver General, and was an ex officio member of the Board of Railway Commissioners. He held those positions until March, 1862, when he became Commissioner of Crown Lands. He resigned from Cabinet in May, 1862.  Judicial career  In 1865, he was appointed judge of the County Court for Hastings County, a position he held until his death. As a judge, he was reported to be \\"courteous, cool and impartial\\".

It is one of two parishes serving the West Lothian county town of Linlithgow, the other being St. Ninian's Craigmailen. St Michael is the town's patron saint; the town's motto is \\"St Michael is kinde to strangers\\". History King David I of Scotland granted a charter for the establishment of the church in 1138. The church was built on the site of an older church and was consecrated in 1242. Following a fire in 1424, most of the present building dates from the mid 15th century, with extensive restorations in the 19th century. Parts of the Church of St Michael were brought into use as they were completed, and the church was completed in 1540. Built immediately to the south of Linlithgow Palace, the church was much favoured as a place of worship by Scottish Kings and Queens. Mary, Queen of Scots, was born in Linlithgow Palace on 8 December 1542 and was baptised in St Michael’s Church. In 1559, at an early stage of the Scottish Reformation, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation destroyed the statues adorning the exterior and interior of the church as signs of \\"popishness\\", and defaced the statue of St Michael which formed part of the structure. Following the Reformation, the interior of the church was reordered. Some traces of pre-Reformation artefacts can still be detected. In 1646, Oliver Cromwell's troops stabled their horses within the nave. Following the departure of the troops, considerable restoration was required. By the early 19th century the church was in a very poor physical condition. Although repairs were made, many of the historic features of the church were destroyed, the interior walls were whitewashed, a plaster ceiling replaced a fine 16th- century one and in 1821 the stone Crown Tower (a crown steeple similar to that of St Giles' Cathedral) had to be dismantled. Rev Archibald Scott introduced the first church organ in 1871 (following the \\"Crieff Organ Case\\" of 1867), and also removed the whitewash from the walls.https://archive.org/stream/drarchibaldscott00sanduoft/drarchibaldscott00sanduoft_djvu.txt While other repairs were completed and the church was rededicated in 1896, the tower was too weakened for restoration of the original crown steeple. By the late 19th century tastes had changed radically, with the installation of the church's first post-Reformation stained glass windows. In 1964, an aluminium crown was installed (replacing the Crown Tower removed in 1821).

In Texas, all cases appealed from district and county courts, criminal and civil, go to one of the fourteen intermediate courts of appeals, with one exception: death penalty cases. The latter are taken directly to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the court of last resort for criminal matters in the State of Texas. The highest court for civil and juvenile matters is the Texas Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court (SCOTX) and the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) each have nine members per the Texas Constitution, the sizes of the intermediate courts of appeals are set by statute and vary greatly. The total number of appellate court seats currently stands at 80, ranging from three to thirteen per court. To equalize caseloads, the Texas Supreme Court regularly transfers batches of cases from one court to another. The transferee court must then apply the precedents of the court from which the case was sent, rather than its own, unless there is no controlling precedent from the court from which the appeal originated. Appellate courts consisting of more than three justices hear and decide cases in panels of three. Occasionally, the entire court sits en banc to reconsider a prior panel decision and to assure consistency in the court's jurisprudence. The en banc process is also used to overrule prior precedent of the same court which its panels would otherwise have to follow. The precedents established by a court of appeals are binding on the lower courts in its own district, but not in others. The First and Fourteenth Court of Appeals, both sitting in Houston in the historic Harris County Courthouse, have coinciding appellate districts, and occasionally hand down conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. Such conflicts may ultimately be resolved by the Texas Supreme Court (in civil cases) or Court of Criminal Appeals (in criminal cases). Decisions of the two courts of last resort on questions of law are binding on all state courts, and are also followed by federal courts when they hear cases governed by Texas state law. The federal courts sitting in Texas apply state law when the case is not controlled by federal law or by the law of another jurisdiction based contractual choice of law or other basis for application of another's jurisdiction's law. Not infrequently the federal district courts sitting in Texas and the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals make guesses as to how the Texas Supreme Court would rule on an issue of state law that is still unsettled due to a conflict among the intermediate courts of appeals.Boren v. U.S. Nat'l Bank Ass'n, 807 F.3d 99, 105-6 (5th Cir. 2015)(Where, as here, the proper resolution of the case turns on the interpretation of Texas law, we are bound to apply Texas law as interpreted by the state's highest court.\\" Am. Int'l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. Rentech Steel LLC, 620 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Because the Texas Supreme Court has not decided whether a lender may abandon its acceleration of a loan by its own unilateral actions and, if so, what actions it must take to effect abandonment, we must make an \\"Erie guess\\" as to how the Court would resolve this issue. Id.) Such an issue may also be referred to the Texas Supreme Court by certified question,TEX. CONST. Art. V, § 3-c(a) (\\"The supreme court [has] jurisdiction to answer questions of state law certified from a federal appellate court.\\"); TEX. R. APP. P. 58 (certified questions of law). but this procedure is rarely employed. Like the members of the Texas Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Justices of the intermediate Texas Courts of Appeals are elected in partisan elections to six-year terms. Many, however, are initially appointed by the Texas Governor to fill vacancies and then run as incumbents in the next election. In the November 2018 general election, many Republican incumbents lost to Democrats, which entailed a switch from Republican control to majority control by Democrats in the Houston, Dallas, and Austin Courts of Appeals. Because not all members were up for reelection in 2018, however, these previously all-Republican courts now have a mixed partisan makeup. Unlike the now more diverse intermediate courts of appeals, the Texas Supreme Court remains under solid Republican control with no minority party representation at all, and is also less diverse demographically than the appellate judiciary as a whole. The intermediate Courts of Appeals have better representation of women and minorities. Some have female majorities and several are led by women as chief justices. Following the recent appointment of Jane Bland, who formerly served on the First Court of Appeals, the Texas Supreme Court now has three women jurists out of nine. History Harris County Courthouse, home of the First Court of Appeals of Texas Courts of civil appeals in Texas were established in 1891 by constitutional amendment to help handle the increasing load of the court system. They had jurisdiction to hear appeals and mandamus petitions of any civil case from their region, with the regions decided by the legislature. The amendment provided that three- judge courts of appeals were to be created by legislature, and in 1892, the legislature created 3 courts of appeals: The First Court of Civil Appeals in Galveston, the Second Court of Civil Appeals in Fort Worth, and the Third Court of Civil Appeals in Austin. In 1893, the legislature created the Fourth Court of Civil Appeals in San Antonio out of territory taken from the first and third courts, and the Fifth Court of Appeals in Dallas. In 1907, the legislature created the Sixth Court of Civil Appeals in Texarkana. Then in 1911, the Seventh Court of Civil Appeals in Amarillo and the Eighth Court of Civil Appeals in El Paso were created. Soon after that, the Ninth Court of Civil Appeals was created in Beaumont in 1915, the Tenth was created in Waco in 1923, and the Eleventh was created in Eastland in 1925.About the Court In 1957, after Hurricane Audrey severely damaged the Galveston County Courthouse, the legislature moved the First Court of Appeals to Houston (where it sits today) and required Harris County to provide facilities.Welcome to the official site of the First Court of Appeals of Texas! It was not until the 1970s that any more courts were created with the Twelfth Court of Civil Appeals in Tyler, the Thirteenth in Corpus Christi and Edinburg, and the Fourteenth in Houston. The latter exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the First Court. In 1977, the legislature increased the number of judges of various courts and authorized courts of appeals to sit in \\"panels\\" of not fewer than three judges. On September 1, 1981, all Courts of Civil Appeals were given criminal jurisdiction, and in 1985 a constitutional amendment was passed so that all courts were known as \\"Courts of Appeals\\" instead of \\"Courts of Civil Appeals.\\" Until 1981, all criminal appeals cases went directly to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and all cases involving capital punishment still do.Justices of Texas 1836–1986 – Timeline of the Texas Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals Texas Court of Criminal Appeals In January 2019, a large number of newly elected justices took office, which required panels that included incumbents who were defeated in the November 2018 elections to be reconstituted. Because of similar turnover in many metropolitan trial courts, pending mandamus cases had to be abated and remanded for the new trial court judge to reconsider the challenged order of his or her predecessor. The overall effect of the November 2018 Democratic sweep of the appellate courts in Houston, Dallas, and Austin was to make the intermediate appellate judiciary more diverse in terms of party affiliation, gender, and race/ethnicity, as can be seen by comparing the demographic statistics reported by the Office of Court Administration for 2018 and 2019.

The Thirteenth Court of Appeals has seats in two cities: Corpus Christi and Edinburg.  Opinion output and public access to opinions and orders  Collectively the Texas Courts of Appeals issue close to 10,000 opinions a year (9,909 in FY 2018) which are almost equally divided between civil and criminal cases. The number is high because appeals to these courts are \\"of right\\" and each case must be decided with an opinion, even if the disposition is in the form of a voluntary dismissal or an involuntary dismissal for noncompliance with briefing rules or a fatal jurisdictional defect. Although the COA follow different conventions in the formatting of their opinions, all are issued in standard PDF and are posted on the COA's respective websites, where they can be looked up through the online docket sheet created for each case. The courts' Case Search portal allows searches by appellate case number, but also by party name and attorney name or bar number, and by other case attributes. Most COAs also make other documents filed in a case available online, including briefs, letters, and notices. The issued opinions can also be found on Google Scholar (CaseLaw) and on other repositories of appellate opinions. Google Scholar additionally includes procedural orders in its database, which are linked to the pages featuring the opinions by the hot-linked appellate case number. Whereas the courts issue majority and dissenting/concurring opinions as separate PDF documents, Google Scholar combines them into one page and displays onscreen in a larger font and more user-friendly format, in addition to providing much better search functionality and hotlinks to cited cases if they are available from its database.  Dissents and Concurrences  Only about 1% of the issued COA opinions are dissents. Concurrences (separate opinions in which a justice agrees with the disposition, but not with the reasons for it, or only in part) accounted for 7% in 2018, up from 0.5% the previous year. The proportion of dissents and concurrences will likely be higher in 2019 and beyond because the largest courts, which were previously controlled by Republicans, now have mixed partisan membership due to the Democratic sweep in 2018 that replaced Republican incumbents who were up for re-election that year. Party affiliation and mixed composition are not the only sources of disagreement that manifest themselves in dissents. Kem Thompson Frost, the Chief Justice of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, is known as an independent thinker and prolific dissenter. She wrote a total of 21 concurring or dissenting opinions in FY 2018 while her counterpart in the First Court of Appeals, Chief Justice Sherry Radack, wrote none. Both presided over all-Republican courts, although one member on the First Court who had been elected as a Republican, Justice Terry Jennings, switched to the Democrats and also wrote large number of separate opinions (19). Statewide, there were 175 dissents and concurrences in Fiscal Year 2018, out of a total of 6,540 merits opinions. The total tally was 9,909, which includes per curiam opinions. As seen by the data for the Houston Courts of Appeals, individual justices can have a big impact on their respective court's comparative ranking, and on the statewide total. By definition, a dissent in the Court of Appeals does not decide the case. Dissents (and concurrences) are nevertheless important because they typically highlight unsettled areas of the law or splits among the Courts of Appeals, and increase the chance that Texas Supreme Court will exercise discretionary review if a petition is filed in a case that drew a dissent in the Court of Appeals.

Retrieved March 2013. Description Restoration of D. hesperus Skull of D. japonicus at the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan. Holotype Desmostylus was a large, hippopotamus-like creature of about long which weighed about . It had a short tail and powerful legs with four hooves. Both the creature's jaws were elongated and sported forward-facing tusks, which were elongated canines and incisors. Most likely fully aquatic, Desmostylus is thought to have lived in shallow water in coastal regions, usually less than 30 meters deep.Kumiko Matsui; Katsuo Sashida; Sachiko Agematsu; Naoki Kohno (2017). \\"Habitat preferences of the enigmatic Miocene tethythere Desmostylus and Paleoparadoxia (Desmostylia; Mammalia) inferred from the depositional depth of fossil occurrences in the Northwestern Pacific realm\\". Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. 471: 254–265. doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.02.005. Recent isotope work indicates that Desmostylus more likely lived (or spent a large amount of time) in freshwater or estuary ecosystems foraging for aquatic freshwater plants. Its less dense bone structure suggests that Desmostylus had a lifestyle of active swimming and possibly feeding at the surface, unlike other desmostylians that were primarily slow swimmers and/or bottom walkers and sea grass feeders. Species Desmostylus hesperus (synonyms and invalid names: D. watasei, D. cymatias, D. californicus, D. mirabilis, D. minor, Desmostylella typica), D. coalingensis (syn. Vanderhoofius coalingensis), and D. japonicus. named the type specimen D. hesperus based on a set of isolated teeth that he had found near Mission San Jose, California (type locality: , paleocoordinates ). Marsh described his specimen as a sirenian and proposed affinities with Metaxytherium (a genus of extinct dugongs) and Halicore (an obsolete name for dugong). Several other species were later described based on minor differences in tooth morphology. Most or all of these species have been synonymized with D. hesperus since variation in tooth morphology between individuals assigned to one of these species has proven to be to greater than the differences between species. Desmostylus japonicus was described by based on a well- preserved partial skull and named by . It has been reproposed as distinct species based on cranial morphology. Fossil distribution Fossils have been discovered from along the northern Pacific Rim from Baja California Peninsula northward along the coast of California, Oregon, Washington and west to Sakhalin Island, Hokkaido, Japan, and south to the Shimane Prefecture, Japan.

Writing career In 1832, Nyren was living in London when he began his collaboration with Cowden Clarke, who recorded Nyren's reminiscences of the Hambledon era and published them serially in The Town as The Cricketers of My Time. The following year, the series with some modifications appeared as part of an instructional book entitled The Young Cricketer's Tutor. It became a major source for the history and personalities of Georgian cricket and also came to be regarded as the first classic in cricket's now rich literary history.Altham, p. 39–40. Personal life As well as being a devotee of cricket, Nyren was a talented musician who played the violin and composed music. Some of his compositions were published by Vincent Novello, who was a close friend. For 13 years Nyren was the choir master at St Mary's, Moorfields, where Novello was the organist. Nyren married Cleopha Copp, aged 17, in 1791. They had two sons and five daughters, as well as two children who died in infancy. They lived first in Portsea, then in 1796 they moved to Bromley in Kent, and later lived in Battersea, London, then Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, and finally moved back to Bromley to live in Bromley Palace, where Nyren died.

Radial artery puncture is a medical procedure performed to obtain a sample of arterial blood for gas analysis. A needle is inserted into the radial artery and spontaneously fills with blood. The syringe is either prepacked with a small amount of heparin to prevent coagulation, or must be heparinised, by drawing up a small amount of heparin and squirting it out again. Most commonly, radial artery puncture is performed to obtain arterial blood sampling for gas analysis. The partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and the pH of arterial blood are important in assessing pulmonary function. These data indicate the status of gas exchange between lungs and blood. Radial artery puncture can also be used for coronary catheterization through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Contraindications * Cellulitis or other infections over the radial artery * Absence of palpable radial artery pulse * A negative Allen test (see below), which indicates that only one artery supplies the hand. A positive Allen test indicates the blood supply to the hand is normal. * Coagulation defects (relative) =Allen test= It is important to perform an Allen test to confirm the patency of the ulnar artery—because, with no collateral flow through the ulnar artery, radial artery puncture can result in a gangrenous finger or loss of the hand from spasm or clotting of the radial artery. The Allen test is performed with the patient sitting with hands resting on knees. A medical professional stands at the patient's side with fingers around the patient's wrist and compresses the tissue over both radial and ulnar arteries for a few minutes—waiting for the blood to drain from the hand while the patient opens and closes the hand several times. Releasing pressure on the ulnar artery while keeping the radial artery occluded should return normal skin color to the ulnar side of the palm in one to two seconds, followed by quick restoration of normal color to the entire palm. A hand that remains white indicates either absence or occlusion of the ulnar artery, and radial artery puncture is contraindicated. Anatomical review The radial artery runs along the lateral aspect of the volar forearm deep to the superficial fascia. The artery runs between the styloid process of the radius and the flexor carpi radialis tendon. The point of maximum pulsation of the radial artery can usually be palpated just proximal to the wrist.

It connects Schurz to Interstate 80 via the cities of Yerington and Fernley. The highway is one of three routes in Nevada that has existed as US 95 Alt. Route description The present US 95 Alt. begins at its junction with US 95 in Schurz and runs west to Yerington. From there, it runs north to Silver Springs (located at the junction with US 50 and Alternate US 50), then continues north to Fernley. Alternate US 95 is routed concurrently with Alternate US 50 from Silver Springs to Fernley. View north from the south end of US 95 Alt. in Schurz Nevada’s official highway log lists the northern termination of the route at its junction with I-80 at Fernley. However, maps, including Nevada’s own official state maps, show the route continuing northeast along I-80 to its junction with mainline US 95 at exit 83. History Dates are based on when changes appear on official Nevada state highway maps unless otherwise noted. The present US 95 Alt. was commissioned in 1941. It ran from its current southern terminus at Schurz to the junction with US 40 and US 95 at Fernley. However, it was displayed on the official 1941 Nevada highway map as US 95, making it appear as if there were two different highways with the same number. The error was corrected on the 1942 map. Alternate US 95 replaced part of SR 3 between Schurz and Yerington; SR 2B from Yerington to present-day Fort Churchill Road, south of Silver Springs; and State Route 1B from Fort Churchill Road to Fernley. A second US 95 Alt. was created in 1960 due a realignment of mainline US 95. Mainline US 95 was extended due north from Fallon to US 40 over the former SR 1A. The former route of US 95 via Fernley was renumbered as Alternate US 95. Strangely, this placed two different routes numbered as US 95 Alt. in the same area of Nevada with the two meeting at Fernley. This lasted until around 1978, when the route from Fallon to Fernley was renumbered as US 50 Alt., except for the easternmost nine miles (14 km); they had been concurrently numbered as US 50 and retained that number.

The remains of timber buildings have been found at the site which may have formed the early residence. Domesday Book records that the bishop had a park for wild animals here in 1086. The first stone building was built by Henry de Blois in 1135. Little remains of this palace, apart from part of the undercroft as it was probably slighted, along with Henry de Blois' other palaces after Henry II came to the throne. The bishop having supported his brother, King Stephen in the civil war with Matilda. After Henry de Blois returned from exile in 1158 the palace was rebuilt, probably with further development under his successor, Richard of Ilchester. In the late 13th and 14th centuries, it was regularly used by the Bishops of Winchester as they travelled, along with Farnham Castle and Wolvesey Castle. Henry III also stayed there a number of times. Richard I held a council here in 1194 before his last expedition to France. Between 1378 and 1401 the palace was largely rebuilt by Bishop William of Wykeham. Further additions were made by his successor Cardinal Beaufort. The final phase of work was carried out by Bishop Langton from 1495. The palace was popular with Royalty, visited by Henry V, and used by Mary Tudor just prior to her marriage to Philip II at Winchester Cathedral.Three Palaces of the Bishop of Winchester, English Heritage, 2000 Henry VIII met Emperor Charles V at the palace in 1522 to negotiate the Treaty of Waltham.

In 1869 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners took over the site and sold it in 1889. The last owner, Viscount Cunningam, passed the ruins into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1952.

Robinson and Miriam Hopkins Barbary Coast is a 1935 American historical and drama film directed by Howard Hawks. Shot in black-and-white and set in San Francisco during the Gold Rush, the film combines elements of crime, Western, melodrama and adventure genres, featuring a wide range of actors, from good-guy Joel McCrea to bad-boy Edward G. Robinson, and stars Miriam Hopkins in the leading role as Mary 'Swan' Rutledge. In an early, uncredited appearance, David Niven plays a drunken sailor being thrown out of a bar. Plot On a foggy night in 1850, Mary Rutledge (Hopkins) and retired Colonel Marcus Aurelius Cobb (Frank Craven) arrive in San Francisco Bay aboard the clipper Flying Cloud. She had come to wed a wealthy owner of a gold mine, but it is revealed that he had lost his mine when the roulette wheel landed on red 13 times at the Bella Donna. The men at the wharf reluctantly inform her that her fiancé is dead, murdered most likely by Louis Chamalis (Robinson), the powerful owner of the Bella Donna restaurant and gambling house. Mary is upset, but quickly pulls herself together and asks the way to the Bella Donna. Mary meets Chamalis and agrees to be his companion, not only for business reasons (as an attraction, she helps draw in customers), but for personal pleasure as well. Chamalis gives her the name 'Swan', and she becomes his female escort. She accompanies him on promenades in town, and he showers her with extravagant gifts. Their relationship sours quickly because Swan is angered by Chamalis's destructive power-mongering. She does not, however, mind running a crooked roulette wheel and cheating the miners out of their gold. Colonel Cobb purchases a printing press, with the intention of starting a respectable newspaper for the people of San Francisco. His first issue includes an article criticizing an unpunished murder by Chamalis and his entourage. When Chamalis finds out, he threatens to destroy Cobb's printing press and burn down the building, but is halted by Swan. Chamalis demands that Cobb never print anything attacking him. The colonel unwillingly complies. Swan becomes disillusioned with her life in San Francisco. Her distant behavior irks Chamalis. One morning, she sets out on horseback. When it begins to rain heavily, she seeks refuge in a seemingly abandoned cabin, where she meets poet and gold miner Jim Carmichael (McCrea). Swan is taken with him, but lies about her current situation after hearing his criticisms of the city. He gives her his book of poems as a memento. Carmichael decides to return to New York. Because of fog the ship will not leave for a few days. He meets Chamalis' helper, Old Atrocity (Walter Brennan), who, seeing his bags of gold is happy to show him to the Bella Donna. Carmichael is surprised to find Mary working there. He is served drugged liquor and plays roulette at her table. He loses his composure, insults 'Swan' and eventually loses his money. Carmichael wakes the following morning in the Bella Donna's kitchen. His eloquent speech impresses Chamalis, who hires him on the spot as a waiter. Carmichael's presence perturbs Mary, who offers him money to depart. Carmichael refuses, wishing to earn the fare on his own. Cobb puts up a poster telling about a murder Chamalis ordered and how the Bella Donna cheats customers. Seeing it, Chamlis' henchman \\"Knuckles\\" Jacoby (Brian Donlevy) shoots both the man who put it up and the publisher when he tries to defend him. Dying, Cobb orders his assistant to print the truth. A vigilante group is formed and hangs Knuckles. Devastated by Cobb's death, Mary acknowledges her love for Carmichael, and works the roulette table so that he wins back the gold he previously lost. Chamalis finds out and sets out to kill Carmichael, who has snuck into Mary's bedroom. The lovers decide to leave together. They find a rowboat and attempt to board the ship in the harbor. They have trouble seeing in the fog, but can hear Chamalis pursuing them. He shoots and injures Carmichael, and corners them beneath a pier. Mary begs him, as proof of his love for her, not to kill Carmichael. Chamalis agrees, but tells her he does not want her anymore. The sheriff arrives with a mob, and Chamalis allows himself to be taken away. Mary returns to Carmichael's side aboard the ship as it prepares to set sail. Cast Production The film is based on the bestseller The Barbary Coast (1933) by Herbert Asbury. When the first draft of the script was submitted to Joseph Breen, he commented to Samuel Goldwyn that \\"The whole flavor of the story is one of sordidness, and low-tone morality.\\"Gregory Black, Hollywood Censored, Cambridge University Press, 1994. 218–220 After months of revisions by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the story changed from a story of an area of San Francisco where men came to find pleasure in drinking, prostitution, and gambling to a love story. Breen commented to Will Hays that it was now a love story \\"between a fine, clean girl\\" and a sentimental young man and that there was \\"no sex, no unpleasant details of prostitution\\" and contains \\"full, and completely compensating, value [...] the finest and most intelligent picture I have seen in many months\\". Reception Andre Sennwald of The New York Times found the film entertaining.Andre Sennwald, \\"'Barbary Coast,' a Thumping Melodrama of the Gold Rush Days\\", The New York Times, Oct, 14, 1935, p. 21 Time felt it was \\"painfully uninspired\\".\\"Cinema: The New Pictures: Oct. 21, 1935\\", Time, Oct. 21, 1935, p. 45 Scholastic, a magazine for youth recommended the film for its \\"authentic background and characters of the days of gold- discovery\\".Scholastic, Nov. 2, 1935, p. 28 (quote obtained from Gregory Black, Hollywood Censored, Cambridge University Press, 1994. 218–220) Newsweek complained that the plot from the original book was thrown away.Newsweek, Oct. 19, 1935, p. 25 (quote obtained from Gregory Black, Hollywood Censored, Cambridge University Press, 1994. 218–220) Canadian Magazine assured Canadians that the film had \\"nothing to do with the cheap, tawdry 'coast' \\" from the novel.Canadian Magazine, Oct. 1935, p. 42 (quote obtained from Gregory Black, Hollywood Censored, Cambridge University Press, 1994. 218–220) Chicago threatened to ban the film. Goldwyn edited a few scenes, and the film was allowed to be exhibited there. The Chicago Legion of Decency condemned Barbary Coast. The Bishop of Los Angeles, John Cantwell, saw the movie with four other priests and enjoyed it; none found it immoral. Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene declared the film a triumphant success, describing it as \\"melodrama of the neatest, most expert kind, well directed, well acted and well written\\". Despite the film's use of what Greene regarded as a conventional plot, he lauded the \\"fresh and interesting\\" use of flawed characters to \\"make something real out of the hocus-pocus\\".

Taxonomy The generic name Prorastomus, a combination of Greek (prōra), prow, and (stoma), mouth, refers to the lower jaw of the animal \\"resembling the prow of a wherry\\". The genus name Prorastomus comes from Greek prora meaning \\"prow\\" and Latin stomus meaning \\"mouth.\\" In 1892, naturalist Richard Lydekker respelled it as Prorastoma with a feminine ending, however this was unjustified as stomus is masculine in Latin. Prorastomus is one of two genera of the family Prorastomidae, the other Pezosiren. These two species are the oldest sirenians, dating to the Eocene. The first specimen was described by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen in 1855, and, being found in Jamaica in the Yellow Limestone Group, pointed to the origin of Sirenia as being in the New World rather than the Old World as was previously thought. However, the modern understanding of Afrotheria as a clade that originally diversified in Africa overturns this idea. The holotype specimen, BMNH 44897, comprises a skull, jaw, and atlas of the neck vertebrae. When Owen first acquired the skull, it was broken in two between the eyes and the braincase. Another specimen was found in 1989 in the same formation, USNM 437769, comprising the frontal bone, a tusk, vertebrae fragments, and ribs. Description While modern sirenians are fully aquatic, the Prorastomus was predominantly terrestrial, judging from the structure of its skull. Judging from its crown-shaped molars and the shape of its snout, it fed on soft plants. The snout is long, narrow, and, at the tip, bulbous. The nasal bones are larger than other sirenians. The nasal ridge is well developed, indicating it had a good sense of smell. The frontal bones are smaller than usual for sirenians, though, as in other sirenians, it had a pronounced brow ridge. Since Pezosiren has a sagittal crest, it is possible the Prorastomus specimen had one too before being eroded away.

It is one of the first television news programs in Venezuela. History El Observador is one of the first television news programs in Venezuela. It has aired almost continuously since November 1953 and was originally known as El Observador Creole. =El Observador Creole= El Observador Crole's first broadcast on November 16, 1953 with anchor Francisco Amado Pernía. Presented by the Creole Petroleum Corporation (a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey), El Observador Creole was Venezuela's first regular news program. The face and voice of Francisco Amado Pernía animated the newscasts from Monday to Saturday and Sunday the newscast corresponded to Cristóbal Rodríquez Pantoja. Seeing that the majority of the personnel that created RCTV originally came from Radio Caracas (later known as Radio Caracas Radio to differentiate it from Radio Caracas Televisión), it was clear that radio personalities such as Amable Espina, Carlos Quintana Negrón, Marco Antonio de Lacavalerie, and Pedro José Fajardo participated in the contest run by The Creole Oil Company to select their pair of hosts for their news program. According to some sources, El Observador Creole first went on the air on 16 November 1953, one day after the inauguration of Radio Caracas Televisión, but José Luis Sarzalejo, manager of the telefilm department of the network at the time, claimed that the first newscast aired on 15 November at 8:00 pm. Everyday, 300 national and international news stories were processed as so were a significant number of photographs and material in 35mm. This consumed an average of 240 feet of film (which was about seven minutes in playtime). The first technical team of the program were Juan Zabala (first technical director), Mario Corro (operator of the video control), Alejandro Wessolowski (coordinator), Alcides Longa (cinematographic editor), Ramiro Vegas (cinematographic coordinator), and Antonio Di Mola (studio photographer). In 1971, RCTV decided to eliminate sole sponsors. The Creole Petroleum Corporation moved to Cadena de Venezolana de Televisión (CVTV) on 3 January 1972, and remained there for the rest of the time that the company remained in Venezuela, which was a little less than two years, until nationalization of oil industry. =El Observador Venezolano= When The Creole Oil Company moved to CVTV, they took two very important things from RCTV: one was El Observador Creole and the other was its host Francisco Amado Pernía. This loss obligated the directors of the network to search for a new presenter and Eladio Lárez, current president of RCTV, was selected to be the conductor of El Observador Venezolano, a variation of the original newscast. Other presenters of El Observador Venezolano included Guillermo Vilchez, Antonio José Marcano, and Inés Sancho. In 1975, Marcel Granier proposed to Luis García Mora, who at that time was the Director of Information of RCTV, to come up with a newscast with the same credibility of a daily newspaper such as El Nacional. The result was the introduction of the figure of the news reporter; the first of these were Marietta Santana and Darcy Alvarado. In the early 1980s, El Observador Venezolano became known simply as El Observador. =El Observador= El Observador's headquarters Over the years, El Observador had been hosted by a number of people including Franklin Villasmil, Tinedo Guia (now retired), Unai Amenábar (now at Venevisión), Alba Cecilia Mujica (now at Globovisión), Jaime Suarez, Anna Vaccarella, and Kristina Wetter to name a few.http://www.venevision.com/estrellas/index.asp?id_estrella=200607200003 In 1996, the El Observador website was launched. In 1998, a computerized system was introduced to make the editing process more efficient and effective, which helped facilitate labor production, save on resources and time, and permit better control and organization. On 18 July 2005, the Centro Nacional de Noticias (National Center for News), El Observador's new headquarters, was inaugurated. From here, RCTV broadcasts El Observador (all three daily emissions), La Entrevista, and other special programs of information and opinion. The President of Empresas 1BC and General Director of RCTV, Marcel Granier, and the President of RCTV, Eladio Larez, were present at its inauguration. It is located in Quinta Crespo, a neighborhood in central Caracas, Venezuela where Radio Caracas Televisión's other studios can be found. The National Center for News has three new and modern studios equipped with the latest technology, a press room with 35 workstations, 10 editing booths, 10 visualization stations, a department of digitalization, a graphics room, and a room dedicated to the reception of satellite and microwave signals. The new center contains six robotic cameras (which do not require the use of a cameraman) and one wireless camera. Also, the center contains a special system of lights that does not produce heat in the studio. New programs were purchased to manage texts and video. One of the most technological advances introduced with the opening of the center is the discontinued use of the VTR, or videotape system, as the center contains a server with the capacity to hold 300 hours of video.Rctv.Net Rctv.Net Rctv.Net On 28 December 2006, President Hugo Chávez announced that the government would not renew RCTV's broadcast license when it expired in May 2007, which threatened the existence of RCTV and El Observador.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061229/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/venezuela_media_1 After the shutdown of RCTV on terrestrial television, El Observador became a webcast, with newscasts being uploaded onto YouTube,YouTube - elobservadorenlinea's Channel venezuelapress.com, and El Observador's own website. It was also aired on Globovisión. During this period, the El Observador channel on YouTube had the most subscribers of all YouTube users. El Observador returned to the air when RCTV relaunched as a cable and satellite channel on 16 July 2007 and currently airs three times a day (9:30 am, 12:00 pm, and 11:00 pm). On 15 June 2008, Javier García, a reporter and part-time anchor for El Observador, was found stabbed to death in his bed at his apartment in the Bello Monte neighborhood of Caracas. A suspect was later arrested. García's murder was the first, and so far only, murder of a current El Observador journalist.http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/americas/ven16jun08na.htmlhttps://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=5176449 El Observador logo from the 1980s News Team Anchors *Alejandro Tastets - morning edition anchor *Roxana Castillo - morning edition anchor *Ana Virginia Escobar - noon edition anchor *Andrés Mendoza - noon edition anchor *Francia Sánchez - night edition anchor *Pedro Guerrero - night edition anchor Reporters *Laura Castellanos *Yanitza León *José Pernalete *María Elisa González *Iris García *Jessica Flores *Violeta Rosas *Junior Acosta *Jennifer De Santana *Romy Gómez *Anahís Cruz - based in Zulia *Edward Rodríguez - based in Zulia *Yamile Jiménez - based in Táchira *Atamaica Briceño - based in Lara *Enler García - based in Anzoátegui *Eillen Salomón - based in Carabobo *Kristian Rodríguez - based in Aragua *Francine Howard - based in Bolívar *Adriana Díaz - based in Sucre *Lisbeth Miquilena - based in Nva.

They display a mix of neo-Classic and neo- Gothic styles. Design influences The following factors affected house design in Goa: *Protecting oneself from the fierce monsoons was the basis of architectural form. *The architectural style of Portuguese-built churches. Exteriors The traditional pre-Portuguese homes were inward-looking with small windows; this reflected the secluded role of women. The houses opened into courtyards, and rarely opened onto streets. The Catholic houses built or refurbished between the middle of the 18th and the 20th centuries were more outward-looking and ornamental, with balcões (covered porches) and verandas facing the street. The large balcões had built-in seating, open to the street, where men and women could sit together and ‘see and be seen’, chat with their neighbours, or just enjoy the evening breeze. These balcões are bordered by ornamental columns that sometimes continued along the steps and added to the stature of the house. This, together with the plinth, which usually indicated the status of the owners. The houses of rich landlords had high plinths with grand staircases leading to the front door or balcão. Large ornamental windows with stucco mouldings open onto verandas. These may appear purely decorative, but have their origins in similar mouldings in the windows of Portuguese houses. There these elements of style were devices to help sailors identify their homes at a distance as they sailed in. The design is therefore an import but serves a similar purpose in Goa: to help construct the identity of the home. Windows gradually became more decorative, ornate, and expressive. Front doors were flanked by columns or pilasters. Railings were the most intricate embellishment in a Goan house. Pillars, piers, and colours do not seem to be influenced by any style in particular; rather they conform to a rather mixed bag of architectural styles. =Cornices= Country tiles used as a corbel are a feature peculiar to Goa. The effect achieved is aesthetically pleasing, giving the roof projection a solid, moulded appearance. =Gateposts and Compound walls= Gateways consisted of elaborately carved compound walls on either side of the gate posts. =Use of colour= Dramatic and startling colour--initially achieved with vegetable and natural dyes--plays an important role in Goan architecture. Colour was decorative and used purely to create a sensation. With a colour wash, the house looked \\"dressed\\" and therefore displayed the economic well-being of the family that lived in it. Here art in architecture performed a social function. However, this was not completely a matter of individual choice, since during Portuguese rule the owner of the house could be fined if his house was not painted. The walls were made of mud and then later of laterite stone; they were usually plastered then painted. Very few buildings are coloured exactly alike and solid colours are used for front facades; interiors are usually in paler colours/white with solid color highlights. This rendering or piping in white is the result of the unwritten rule during the Portuguese occupation of Goa that no private house or building could be painted in white. Only churches and chapels enjoyed this privilege. It is understandable that Goan Christians followed this rule, as white was associated with the Virgin Mary and therefore the virtues of purity and chastity (both desirable in Goa), but, surprisingly, Goan Hindus also respected this practice. As a result of this code, an interesting and aesthetically pleasing trend developed, as competition among neighbours gave impetus to variety. Interiors Most houses are symmetrical with the entrance door occupying the place of honour. Typically this front door leads to a foyer which then either leads to the sala (the main hall for entertaining a large number of guests) or the sala de visita (a smaller hall for entertaining a small number of guests) and in some cases the chapel in the house. From here one can also directly enter the rest of the house, which usually revolved around a courtyard. Typically the master bedroom opens into the sala or is close to it. The dining room is usually perpendicular to these rooms; the bedrooms flank the courtyard, and the kitchens and service areas are at the rear of the house. In the case of two-story houses, a staircase, either from the foyer or the dining room, leads to more bedrooms. Consisting of humble burnt earth plastered over with cow dung and hay, or with elaborate patterns made with tiles imported from Europe, the floors in Goan houses have been both workplaces and statements. Almost all Goan houses have a false ceiling of wood. Goan Hindu houses The goan Hindu Architectural style is different from the Portuguese-influenced style. Hindu houses have little colonial influence. Most of the big houses have a courtyard called as Rajangan in Konkani where a Tulasi Vrindavan is seen. A special place called a Soppo is often used for relaxing. Goan traditional Hindu houses have the following features: *Angan (courtyard with a Tulasi Vrundavan) *Rajangan (a courtyard inside the house) *Deva kood (a place for daily prayer and other rituals) *Saal (a hall) *Raanchi kood (a kitchen with a door which is called Magil daar) *A room special meant for pregnant and nursing mothers. *Kothar (store room) *A hall specially meant for celebrating Ganeshotsav References *Heta Pandit and Annabel Mascarenhas, Houses of Goa, Architecture Autonomous, Goa, 1999. *The Goan House Category:Architecture of India Category:Buildings and structures in Goa Category:Houses in India ","title":"Goan houses"},{"id":"5643954","text":"The year 1634 in music involved some significant events.

He played for the Seattle Mariners, Tigers, and the Cleveland Indians of the Major League Baseball (MLB), and also the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He previously worked as an analyst for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Baseball =Playing career= Allen was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the sixth round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. He enjoyed a brief stint with the Seattle Mariners in 1983. He was 23 years old when he made his major league debut on April 7, 1983. He hit .296 in 27 at-bats during a 15-game stint as an outfielder and designated hitter with the World Series Champion Detroit Tigers in 1984, but was not on the team during the postseason. He enjoyed another brief stint in the majors with the Cleveland Indians in 1988. Allen spent the last three years of his playing career with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of the NPB. He hit a pair of home runs against Seibu Lions in the 1991 Japan Series and set a Japanese regular season record with four home runs in four consecutive at bats during his time in the league. He is infamous for charging the mound after Yokohama Taiyo Whales pitcher Kazuhiko Daimon hit him in the back with a pitch, subsequently chasing Daimon across the entire field with both teams' benches in tow. =Coaching career= Prior to his work as a broadcaster, Allen spent four seasons as a hitting instructor in the Florida Marlins organization from 1992 through 1995. In 1994 and 1995, he was the hitting coach for the Kane County Cougars, the Marlins Single-A affiliate in the Midwest League. Some of the notable batters he coached include Mike Redmond, Kevin Millar, and Luis Castillo. During his time in the organization, Allen worked under Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski, who would later become the Tigers president, CEO, and general manager. =Broadcasting= Arizona Diamondbacks From 1998 to 2002 he spent five seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks as a television (Fox Sports Arizona) and radio (KTAR) analyst. He served as the color commentator on the Diamondbacks radio broadcasts during the 2001 postseason, including the World Series win against the New York Yankees. Allen was replaced as Diamondbacks television analyst by former major leaguer Mark Grace. Detroit Tigers Allen was the regular color commentator on Detroit Tigers telecasts for Fox Sports Detroit, joined by play-by-play man Mario Impemba. Allen won Michigan Emmys in 2006 and 2007 for his analysis of Detroit Tigers baseball. Allen is a longtime member of the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association founded in 1948 by Tigers broadcaster Ty Tyson. On September 21, 2016, Tigers catcher James McCann hit a three-run home run against the Minnesota Twins that put the Tigers up 6-0 in the sixth inning. Allen excitedly shouted \\"Second Deck!\\", but when heard, it sounds like \\"suck a dick.\\" This was picked up by Detroit radio station WXYT-FM and is quickly becoming their most popular drop.http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/09/22/rod-allens-second-deck-home-run- call-is-an-internet-sensation-video/ On September 4, 2018, Allen and Impemba were allegedly involved in a physical altercation off the air after broadcasting the Tigers game against the Chicago White Sox. Fox Sports Detroit sent the men home on different planes after the game, and the next night's telecast was covered by Kirk Gibson and field-level reporter Matt Shepard. One source claimed that there was an argument over a chair, followed by Allen using a choke hold on Impemba, but Allen's agent denied that his client choked Impemba. On September 7, Fox Sports Detroit suspended both men from calling any Tigers games for the remainder of the 2018 season. It was later announced that Impemba and Allen's contracts were not renewed for future seasons, ending their 17-year partnership.Broadcasters Rod Allen, Mario Impemba won't return to Detroit Tigers The Detroit Free Press, October 9, 2018 Fox Saturday Baseball In addition to his work for the Diamondbacks and Tigers, Allen did color commentary for Fox Saturday Baseball, including games involving the Tigers until 2018. Family life Allen and his wife, Adrian, have four children: Rhonda, Rod, Jr., Andrew, and Rachel. The Allens live in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Rod, Jr. was selected by the New York Yankees in the 12th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft after a collegiate career at Arizona State University. He played the 2004 season with the Staten Island Yankees in the New York–Penn League, and played for the Class A Winston-Salem Warthogs in 2006 and 2007. His most recent professional stint was in 2011 with the White Sands Pupfish in the Pecos League. Andrew was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 43rd round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. He attended Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona.

Charged with espionage-related offenses in connection with passing sensitive military and diplomatic information to Greece, he was arrested in Greece through a FBI sting operation. Lalas pled guilty in federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit espionage, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Later paroled, Lalas emigrated to Greece to serve out the remainder of his parole. Spying activities During his active years as a spy, Lalas passed an estimated 700 highly classified documents, that included U.S. gathered intelligence information of Turkish military strategy in the Aegean Sea and Cyprus, and U.S. diplomatic assessments and views on the Republic of Macedonia. Athens was Lalas' fourth communications posting with the State Department. He also served at posts in İzmir (where he was allegedly recruited by the Greeks), Belgrade, Istanbul, and Taiwan. U.S. investigators claimed he made an average of US$24,000 over a two-year period by providing documents, thus earning a steady income selling Defense Intelligence Agency reports about troop strength, political analyses, and military discussions contained in cables between the U.S. Embassy in Athens and the White House. He also obtained information from FBI communications about counterterrorism efforts, and the names and job descriptions of CIA personnel stationed overseas.  Lalas' apprehension According to the U.S. government, it received the first tip that led to identification of Lalas as a spy as a result of an accidental slip in a conversation between an official of the Greek Embassy in Washington and a State Department official. The Greek official knew of information that could only have come from a secret communication between the U.S. Embassy in Athens and the State Department. The State Department official recognized something wasn't right and reported it. This led to an FBI secret investigation, and Lalas was later observed through a video monitoring system stealing documents intended for destruction, taking them out of the US embassy and handing them over to his Greek liaison. Also according to U.S. authorities, Lalas originally claimed he had been recruited by Greek military officials in 1991, and that he feared for the welfare of relatives living in Greece if he had not cooperated. Authorities later discovered that he began spying for the Greek government in 1977 while with the U.S. Army. Trial and sentence  In June 1993, Lalas pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit espionage and on September 16 was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison without possibility of parole. Prosecutors had recommended the 14-year sentence in return for Lalas’ promise to reveal what documents he turned over and to whom. The full extent of his espionage activity was confirmed prior to his sentencing only after he failed two FBI polygraph examinations. Yet in debriefings the prosecutors said Lalas did not reveal the full extent of his spying. Current events Lalas was on parole until July 2010. He returned to Greece on November 25, 2007, after written assurances from Greek Justice Minister Sotiris Hadjigakis that the Greek government would fulfill any U.S. court decision regarding Lalas' parole. Greek public opinion is divided between those who consider him an heroic example of a dedicated patriot and those who consider him as an opportunist and a media sellout. The Greek intelligence community regard him as the most important agent they had ever recruited in the past half of the 20th century. As for Steven Lalas himself, even though the Greek government did not support him or his family in Greece when he was arrested, he continued to praise his country of origin while in prison. In his appearances in Alexis Papahelas' show \\"Oi Fakeloi\\", he stated that if he had the chance he would do it all over again, even if he was to be arrested and spend again 14 years in prison separated from his wife and two kids. He also publicly denies that he ever received any money, and insists that his motivation was only inspired by patriotic feelings for his country of origin.

It represents positions as X, Y, and Z coordinates. The point (0, 0, 0) is defined as the center of mass of Earth, hence the term geocentric coordinates. The distance from a given point of interest to the center of Earth is called the geocentric radius or geocentric distance. Its axes are aligned with the international reference pole (IRP) and international reference meridian (IRM) that are fixed with respect to Earth's surface, hence the descriptor earth-fixed. This term can cause confusion, since Earth does not rotate about the z-axis (unlike an inertial system such as ECI), and is therefore alternatively called ECR. The z-axis extends through true north, which does not coincide with the instantaneous Earth rotational axis. The slight \\"wobbling\\" of the rotational axis is known as polar motion. The x-axis intersects the sphere of the earth at 0° latitude (the equator) and 0° longitude (prime meridian in Greenwich). This means that ECEF rotates with the earth, and therefore coordinates of a point fixed on the surface of the earth do not change. Conversion from a WGS84 datum to ECEF can be used as an intermediate step in converting velocities to the north east down coordinate system. Conversions between ECEF and geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are discussed at geographic coordinate conversion. In astronomy Geocentric coordinates can be used for locating astronomical objects in the Solar System in three dimensions along the Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes. They are differentiated from topocentric coordinates, which use the observer's location as the reference point for bearings in altitude and azimuth. However, neither system takes Earth's constant motion into account, which requires the addition of a time component to fix objects. For nearby stars, astronomers use heliocentric coordinates, with the center of the Sun as the origin. The plane of reference can be aligned with the Earth's celestial equator, the ecliptic, or the Milky Way's galactic equator. These 3D celestial coordinate systems add actual distance as the Z axis to the equatorial, ecliptic, and galactic coordinate systems used in spherical astronomy. The distances involved are so great compared to the relative velocities of the stars, that for most purposes, the time component can be neglected.

Luu's parents came to the United States in 1975, with her birth coming just a year afterward. During her childhood, Luu attended Haley Elementary and Blackhawk Middle School. Luu later attended Snider High School, where she won first place for a speech written for 'Project XL', an Indiana competition sponsored by Farm Bureau and the Indiana High School Athletic Association. Having co-anchored the school's weekly television show known as Panther's Pause, Luu also graduated as valedictorian from Snider High School, having been labeled as \\"Most Likely to be the First Woman President\\" in the school yearbook. Luu's parents had many expectations for her that involved a degree in medicine. She had wanted to be a doctor since she was young, which was why she first enrolled in and graduated from the University of Michigan, pursuing a pre-med double major and earning Bachelor of Science degrees in both biology and Latin. She graduated in 1998, but decided afterward that she \\"didn't want a medical career\\". Career For her first job, she worked at the ABC affiliate, 21-Alive WPTA TV, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States as a production assistant in charge of minor editing and running the teleprompter. Rising to the position of full television reporter after a year and a half, Luu was known to be the \\"second Vietnamese TV reporter in her city\\". In 2004 Luu helped organize 'Pop Filter' as an art installation and event. Its success led to her creating 'City Prototype' with Matt Stuart, as an event to highlight the importance of ideas and creativity in relation to Fort Wayne's economic growth. This event prompted proactive involvement from school students and recent graduates in sharing their own visions for the future of the city. Also in 2004, she was a winner of the 2004 Future 40 Award presented by the Fort Wayne Business Journal, to individuals selected for their achievements in professional accomplishment.

History Saint Marcellin Champagnat, a young priest in rural south-east France, founded the Marist Brothers to educate the poor. The Brothers then spread to many parts of the world, arriving in Cape Town in 1867. In 1929, (after the Brothers had opened St. Charles College, Pietermaritzburg), the Brothers opened St Henry's with Brother Paul Eusterius as principal. Since then the school has greatly expanded, particularly under the previous principal, Dr Anthony Akal, who was at the helm from 1982 until 2011. The school has a wonderful aspect, along the Ridge above Durban with a view over the City to the bay on the one side and inland towards the Valley of a Thousand Hills on the other. The school started as a day school for boys, but has recently become co-educational. The Brothers gradually withdrew from the teaching life of the school (which is now under lay control) but still play a major part in the religious aspects of the school, upon which the College prides itself. The emphasis on religion, discipline and a strong sense of a \\"school-family\\" add to the school's appeal. The school motto is Omnia Vincite,which means Conquer all difficulties. Recent history Facilities =General facilities= The school recently refurbished its two tennis courts and the tuck shop. The school also has four fields, an amphitheater, an observatory, and a state-of-the-art Learning Resources Center, which contains a library section, teaching venues, a computer room and a Long Distance Audio Visual room. Many of the school's classrooms were recently equipped with Smartboards. The school also has a gymnasium, chapel and two laboratories. The Foundation Phase playground and school gardens have also been significantly improved. =Recent expansions= In 2010, the College moved its Art Department to a large house next to the school. The ground floor of this house was converted into a teaching venue complete with a small library, classroom, office and veranda for working on large projects. An Academic Support Center has been launched on the upper floors of the house. The College also recently expanded its Music School, which now contains four practice rooms, and a main teaching room. Each room has been soundproofed, and the syllabus has been broadened to include music as an official school subject. The school is a member of the Durban Youth Council, and has a strong representation in the organisation. Uniform The school colours are gold, navy blue and platinum. These are incorporated into the uniform of each phase. =Foundation Phase (Grade 000 – 0)= Boys wear navy blue tee shirts (without the school badge) and navy blue tracksuit pants or shorts. Girls wear sleeveless blue checked dresses with a navy blue tee shirt underneath. =Intermediate Phase (Grade 3 – 7)= Boys wear short- sleeved navy blue collar shirts, with the school badge on the front chest pocket, and navy blue shorts. Knee-length black socks with a fold-over blue band with two gold stripes are also worn. Black boys' lace-up school shoes are also worn. Girls wear a short-sleeved checkered dress, a pattern of gold and platinum stripes. The sleeves and collar are edged in navy blue. =High School (Grade 8 – 12)= The boys wear long-sleeved or short-sleeved white shirts with the school tie. Gray trousers, grey socks and black lace-up school shoes are also worn. The school blazer, which is navy blue with gold stripes, must be worn when travelling to and from school, or in public, but may be removed during the day on the school grounds. The girls wear long-sleeved or short-sleeved white shirts with the school tie. Gray knee-length skirts, white ankle-length socks, and black buckle shoes are worn. The same rules with regards to the blazer applies to girls. =The school blazer, badge and tie= The school blazer is single-breasted, with two silver buttons, and a small silver cuff button on each sleeve. It is navy blue with vertical gold stripes, with the school badge emblazoned onto the chest pocket. The school badge consists of an intertwined \\"A\\" and \\"M\\" (Ave Maria) in gold, within an escutcheon. Beneath the shield is a scroll bearing the initials \\"M.B.D.\\" for Marist Brothers' Durban. The school tie is navy blue with diagonal gold stripes. College Awards The College may award students with Half Colours, Full Colours, Colours Blazers and Honours Blazers, for outstanding achievements in a variety of fields. =Half Colours= Half Colours may be awarded to a student who meets certain criteria, as laid down in the College's School Diary. For achieving Half Colours in a particular field, the student is presented with a Half Colours Tie, which is worn instead of the normal school tie. The Half Colours Tie is navy blue with the school badge and the field of achievement (for example, Cross Country) on it. =Full Colours= The criteria for Full Colours are far more stringent than those for Half Colours. Upon achieving Full Colours, the student is presented with a gold scroll bearing the name of the field of endeavour. This scroll is sewn onto the normal school blazer, below the school badge. Each Full Colours scroll bears a certain number of points, either 2 points or 4 points. These points are used to calculate whether an individual is qualified for a Colours Blazer. =Colours Blazer= To receive a Colours Blazer, a students must have accrued a minimum of 10 points. Once obtained, the Colours Blazer replaces all the student's scrolls and the normal school blazer. Therefore, any existing scrolls or scrolls acquired after the student receives a Colours Blazer may not be sewn onto the Blazer. The Colours Blazer is navy blue. The Colours Blazer Badge also consists of the escutcheon and interwoven \\"A\\" and \\"M\\", but has gold laurel leaves around the shield. =Honours Blazer= To receive an Honours Blazer, a student must have received a Colours Blazer, and a Merit Scroll. The Head Boy, Head Girl and their deputies all automatically receive Honours Blazers upon their appointment. The Honours Blazer is the College's highest award, and is not given to individuals based on their performance or achievements. It is only presented to students who show outstanding leadership qualities, and are involved in service both within the school, and in the greater community. The Honours Blazer is navy blue with gold braiding around the sleeves, lapels and edges of the blazer. The badge for this blazer is completely different, as it is the school's individual badge, rather than the general Marist badge used worldwide.

Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “homo economicus” as well as behavioral economics. Economics of security addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions. Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks? Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in security engineering.  Emergence of economics of security  National security is the canonical public good. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues. In 2000, Ross Anderson wrote, Why Information Security is Hard. Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on altruism for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security. Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a public good but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative externality value. Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods. Six years later, iDEFENSE, ZDI and Mozilla have extant markets for vulnerabilities. In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi- faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: OCTAVE. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice. In 2001, in an unrelated development, Lawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb published Using Information Security as a Response to Competitor Analysis System. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost- benefit) aspects of information security. The authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.  Examples of findings in economics of security  Proof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that proof of work cannot work. In fact, the finding was that proof of work cannot work without price discrimination as illustrated by a later paper, Proof of Work can Work. Another finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of privacy is not, in economic terms anonymity, but rather price discrimination. Privacy and price discrimination was authored by Andrew Odlyzko and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior. Hal Varian presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. Free riding is the end result, in any case. Lawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb wrote the Economics of Information Security Investment. The Gordon–Loeb model is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.

Originally hailing from Isfahan, Iran, the family have been settled in the Indian subcontinent for more than a century. History Mirza Abu Talib Ispahani visited England in 1799, and the family have maintained a presence and properties in Richmond, London. In 1820, Mohammed Hashim (1789–1850) moved from Isfahan in Qajar Iran to Bombay and established the Ispahani Group business. In the 1830s, the business extended to Calcutta in Bengal. Hashim was notable as the first Muslim of the Assam Tea Company's Calcutta Committee. The family business also expanded from Madras in the south and Burma in the east. Many of their descendants were educated at English private schools and top universities in UK. Hashim's grandson, Mirza Mehdy (1841–1913) made Madras as the business's headquarters. He spent twelve years in Cairo, Egypt trading Indian produce such as leather, tea, turmeric, tamarind and peanuts amongst others. In 1888, he established a branch in Dacca. Mirza Mohamed Ispahani was the son of Mehdy and was born in 1871. Mohamed established the Calcutta office of MM Ispahani & Sons in 1900.

He was then the Minister of Industries and Commerce until 1955. The final move of headquarters was made in 1947 with the shifting of the corporate headquarters to Chittagong in the newly created Dominion of Pakistan where it stands today. The Company continued to operate as a foreign company in Calcutta until 1965 when its operations in India were taken over by the Government of India. It was under the visionary leadership of Ahmad that the company rapidly expanded its business. By 1947, MM Ispahani Limited was a leading exporter in shellac, kapok, hessian, jute bags, tea and chemicals. In 1948, Mirza Ahmad Ispahani left the family business for public service in Pakistan (which included what is now Bangladesh).

It lived during the middle Eocene period 45 million years ago. The first discovered protocetid, Protocetus atavus was described by based on a cranium and a number of associated vertebrae and ribs found in middle Lutetian Tethyan marine limestone from Gebel Mokattam near Cairo, Egypt. Description Restoration Protocetus had a streamlined, whale-like body around long, but was relatively primitive in many respects; it still had small hind flippers, and its front flippers had webbed toes. Its jaws were long and lined with deadly teeth. The shape of the bones in the tails suggests that it may have evolved tail flukes, like those of modern whales, and, while it did not have a true blowhole, the nostrils had already begun to move backwards on the head. Unlike its more primitive predecessor Pakicetus, the structure of the ears suggests that Protocetus was able to hear properly underwater, although it is unlikely that it could echolocate. Similarly, it retained sufficient olfactory apparatus to have a good sense of smell, although it probably relied more on its eyesight to find prey.

The object of the game is for the other players to deduce what the original homophone pair is. The first person to correctly identify the secret homophones \\"wins\\" for that sentence and creates a new homophone puzzle. Like the word game \\"Ghost\\", this game is often played on long car rides with multiple people.

For this example, the player decides the sentence will be, \\"George had to pay a sales tax when he bought a box of tacks.\\" The player then chooses a word to substitute for both homophones in the homophone pair. Let us say that he chooses the word \\"chicken\\". He then says aloud to the other players, \\"George had to pay a sales chicken when he bought a box of chicken.\\" The player that created the sentence then tells the other players which pair of identical words, in this case \\"chicken\\", has replaced the homophone pair.

In the video for \\"Boyz Are Gonna Rock,\\" the singer in the video is Mark Slaughter rather than the actual singer Robert Fleischman. Fleischman left the band prior to filming the video and Mark Slaughter lip-synched to Fleischman's vocals. \\"Back on the Streets\\" was originally written by Vincent and recorded by 3 Speed for the 1984 movie Voyage of the Rock Aliens. It was later covered by Europe's original guitarist John Norum for his 1987 solo album Total Control. This song was also played by Ace Frehley during his earliest shows with his post-Kiss band Frehley's Comet in 1985 and also demoed by his band as well during this time, but the song has never appeared on any of Ace Frehley's solo albums. The song \\"Invasion\\" (for the CD and cassette versions) contained about three minutes of looping guitar feedback at the end of the song. The record version had the same feedback, but the difference was that it never ended until you picked up the needle. This was because the sound went all the way to the end of the vinyl, causing the needle to loop it over and over again. The liner notes state (somewhat implausibly) that no pedals, outboard gear or synthesizers were used anywhere on the album. The band opened for Alice Cooper in 1986 and Iron Maiden in 1987 to support the record. The song \\"Animal\\" appeared on the soundtrack for the 1987 movie Summer School.

He made 78 known first-class appearances and was mainly associated with Hampshire when its teams were organised by the Hambledon Club. As well as playing for Hampshire, Harris appeared for a number of other teams including Berkshire, Kent, Surrey, Marylebone Cricket Club and several invitation XIs. Noted for his fast and accurate bowling, Harris was a right arm fast underarm bowler and a left-handed batsman. Career Born in 1755 at Elvetham, Hampshire, the earliest known mentions of Harris are playing for Odiham in 1782.Waghorn, p.55.Waghorn, p.56. Harris' first recorded game for Hampshire was against Kent in July 1782.Haygarth, p. 51. Although he was never noted as a batsman, Harris made the top score of 27 in Hampshire's first innings, in which they were dismissed for 87. Harris played three times for Hampshire in the 1783 season, twice against Kent and once against All-England. He took nine wickets in these matches.Haygarth, p.57–59. Harris is only recorded once in 1784 when he again played for Odiham in a minor match. In 1785, when few first-class matches took place, Harris played for Berkshire against Essex.Waghorn, p. 64. On 13 July 1776, Harris had his best known performance to date when he took four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at Windmill Down, Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket. This was the match in which Tom Sueter was given out hit the ball twice, the earliest recorded instance of this form of dismissal.Haygarth, p. 66. On 8–12 August of the same year, Harris played for the White Conduit Club against Kent at Bourne Paddock and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to Tom Walker and Tom Taylor becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.Haygarth, p. 68. Playing for Sir Horatio Mann's XI against the Earl of Winchilsea's XI at the new Lord's Old Ground on 26–28 May 1788, Harris took 10 wickets in the match with 4 in the 1st innings and 6 in the 2nd. But it was to little avail as Winchilsea's XI won by 106 runs.Haygarth, p.81. By now, Harris' reputation was well established and he played regularly in major matches into the 1790s. He was a frequent taker of wickets and again took ten in a match on 30–31 August 1790 when he guided Hampshire to a 10-wicket win against All-England at Lord's Old Ground.Haygarth, p.108. On 15–17 August 1792, Harris had the best known return of his career when he took 11 wickets in the match for Hampshire against Kent at Cobham Park, including eight in the first innings. Hampshire won by 8 wickets.Haygarth, p.140. His later career was ruined by attacks of gout and Harris played his final match on 13–15 August 1798 for All-England v. Surrey at Lord's Old Ground. He took five wickets in the 1st innings and his last, subject to the batting order, was when he bowled W Wells for 5. He scored 0* in his final innings and his team won the match by an innings and 1 run.Haygarth, p.243–244. He died 19 May 1803, Crookham Village, Hampshire Style and technique Harris was highly rated by his contemporaries, especially John Nyren, who called him \\"the very best bowler; a bowler who, between any one and himself, comparison must fail\\". Nyren described Harris' style and technique in some detail. Harris began from an erect stance \\"like a soldier at drill\\" and raised the ball to his forehead before stepping forward. In his delivery stride, he brought the ball from under his arm \\"by a twist\\" and nearly as high as his armpit. With this action he would \\"push it, as it were, from him\\". Nyren says the speed of the delivery was \\"extraordinary\\" and that he could not understand how Harris managed to achieve such speed. Some line drawings of Harris and other players of the 1790s have survived.Mote, endpaper. Harris is shown in the characteristic pose described by Nyren as he began his action, standing erect with the ball raised over his head. The ball when delivered was pitched very fast and accurately. Harris seems to have got \\"pace off the pitch\\" and Nyren has recorded that numerous batsmen received nasty injuries to their unprotected hands from balls that trapped their (ungloved) fingers against the bat handle.Nyren, p.95. Like Thomas Boxall and the brothers Tom and Harry Walker, Harris used to practice his bowling in a barn during the winter.Pycroft, p.51 & 75. Personal life Harris was born at Elvetham but moved when still a child to Crookham (now known as Crookham Village), where he lived for the rest of his life. He never married and was a potter by trade. Nyren, who knew Harris personally, described him as \\"a muscular, bony man, standing about five feet 9½ inches\\".Nyren, p.93. Nyren remarked on Harris' personality and looks by saying he had \\"a remarkably kind and gentle expression\\" and an \\"honest face\\". Harris, said Nyren, was \\"a man of so strict a principle\\" and \\"such high honour\\".Nyren, p.94. Harris suffered from gout in his later years and the sources have recorded how he would arrive at a game on crutches and then sit on a chair between deliveries.Haygarth, p.52. He was unable to play after 1798 and \\"latterly, in fact, was quite a cripple\\". He died in 1803 at Crookham and was buried at nearby Crondall, though no tombstone was erected.

The panorama itself is also known as The Great Siberian Route: the Main Trans-Siberian Railway. The Railway Panorama was commissioned by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, and shown in the Siberian section of the Exposition's Russian pavilion. It recreated the most interesting stages of a journey from Moscow to Beijing on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The actual trip would have been 6,300 miles, and taken 14 days, although not all of the tracks were in fact complete by 1900; the simulated experience lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour. The installation included three 70-foot-long luxury railway cars, complete with saloons, dining rooms, and bedrooms. The audience would sit in the railway cars, and view the panorama through the windows. Additional spectators could watch from rows of seats placed alongside the cars. The moving panorama was a stage-like area with multiple layers of moving objects and scrolling paintings. The nearest objects were sand, rocks, and boulders attached to a horizontal belt that moved at a speed of 1000 feet per minute. Next was a low screen painted with shrubs and brush, which moved at 400 feet per minute. Behind that, another screen with paintings of more distant scenery moved at 130 feet per minute. The final screen showed mountains, forests, and cities; it was 25 feet tall and 350 feet long, and moved just 16 feet per minute. The net result of these four layers was to produce a simulated perspective of great depth, via motion parallax. \\"A Trip to Siberia\\" - Panorama building at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904 The panorama was created under the direction of Pavel Yakovlevich Pyasetsky. Pyasetsky made numerous sketches and watercolor drawings based on trips along the railway route through Siberia beginning in 1897. Features shown included the cities of Moscow, Omsk, Irkutsk, and Beijing, and the Great Wall of China. The panorama was not fully complete until 1903, years after the Paris Exposition. According to a newspaper article and comments of filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché, Pyasetsky was also commissioned to make a cinematograph of the trip, which was reportedly shown to Tsar Nikolas II, but the film was not used in the public exhibit. The jury at the Paris Exposition awarded the Railway Panorama a Gold Medal, and Pyasetsky received the Order of the Legion of Honor. The exhibit was also shown at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. The panoramic painting itself still exists, in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. In 2004, the Hermitage announced plans to restore, document, and exhibit the painting.

In the late 19th century there was a debate whether large and small specimens attributed to Zeuglodon brachyspondylus (declared a nomen dubium by Uhen 2005) were separate species or not. Hoping to clarify things, restricted Z. brachyspondylus to the large fossils (including the Z. brachyspondylus lectotype) and created the subspecies Z. brachyspondylus minor for the small specimens which had previously been synonymized with Dorudon serratus. proposed the genus Zygorhiza for the subspecies.

P2–M2 have two widely separated roots, accessory denticles on the anterior and posterior cutting edges, and anastomosing striae on the enamel. P1 is caniniform with a single root. P2–4 have laterally compressed crowns and accessory denticles on the anterior and posterior cutting edges. P4 is the largest lower tooth. M1–3 have accessory denticles on the posterior cutting edges. P2–3 are two-rooted. Outside the upper one-rooted teeth and inside the upper two-rooted teeth there are pits for reception of the lower teeth. Zygorhiza (and Dorudon) replaced their upper and lower deciduous first premolars with permanent teeth. This is very unusual in modern mammals and contrasts to extant toothed whales that only develop a single set of teeth. It might indicate that Zygorhiza represents a stage in archaeocete evolution where skeletal maturation was delayed like in modern cetaceans. Zygorhiza differs from all other dorudontines in the presence of well-developed cuspules on the cingula of the upper premolars. =Skeleton= Fossil in Teylers Museum, Haarlem The skull is elongated with a narrow rostrum and a flattened forehead; the premaxillae are laterally convex. The high sagittal crest is flanked by two large temporal fossae, resulting in a narrow intertemporal region. The hyoid apparatus consists of a small, central, and hexagonal basihyoid bone. From this bone project a pair of thyrohyoid bones (homologous with the greater cornua in humans) that are slightly expanded anteriorly and tapper off posteriorly, and another pair of slender and elongated bones, the epihyoid and stylohyoid bones. The elbow is a hinge joint without rotary movements and the forelimbs are relatively short. The humeri of Zygorhiza and Chrysocetus are more gracile than those of Dorudon. The vertebral formula is 7 cervicals, 15 thoracics, probably 13 lumbars, 2 sacrals, and at least 21 caudals. The centra of the posterior thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and anterior caudal are slightly elongated. The centra of the cervicals are compressed and the flexibility in the neck is limited by the interlocked lateral processes. The atlas has a hypapophysial (ventral) process. The axis, a small odontoid (tooth-like) process, short and narrow transverse processes, and an elongated neural spine.

History They were signed to Rough Trade Record Company (home of many notable acts such as The Strokes and The Long Blondes) when they were spotted at only their sixth gig (a first for Rough Trade) and released two albums, Cookies and Kicks. Lead singer Jackie (aka John) McKeown and bassist, Jamie McMorrow, were the founding members of Scottish indie band The Yummy Fur. The line-up over the years that The Yummy Fur existed changed on numerous occasions. At one point, both Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos and drummer Paul Thomson were members of the group. 1990s' drummer Michael McGaughrin and bassist Dino Bardot were also in Glasgow band V-Twin, signed to Domino Records, before 1990s were formed. 1990s had supported Babyshambles at the Glasgow Barrowlands, and Franz Ferdinand at the SECC and Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre, as well as releasing their debut single, \\"You Made Me Like It/Arcade Precinct\\" on limited edition vinyl. They played at the Indian Summer festival at Victoria Park in Glasgow on 2 September 2006, alongside bands such as Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Fall and Antony and the Johnsons and also Bestival on the Isle of Wight. 1990s went on tour in October 2006 with The Long Blondes, and with CSS in November. According to the band, they play music \\"like a blonde gets out of a car\\". On the official website it was revealed Jamie McMorrow left the band on 5 September 2007. He was replaced by Norman Blake of Teenage Fanclub on the 2007 European tour. Dino Bardot of Stinky Munchkins (also formerly of V-Twin alongside Michael McGaughrin), played the bass on the Australian and North American shows in late 2007, and was confirmed as a new member of the band on their MySpace page early in 2008. The band's second album, Kicks, was produced by Bernard Butler and was released on 23 March 2009. This twelve-track sophomore effort included the glam-stomp of \\"The Box\\", \\"Everybody Please Relax\\" and the single \\"59\\" (the video of which was shot on the number 59 bus around Glasgow). It boasted a beefier, harmony-driven sound, whilst maintaining the band's trademark style and wit. Kicks also featured a guest turn from former The Long Blondes singer Kate Jackson, who lent backing vocals to the track \\"Kickstrasse\\". NME wrote that \\"like Supergrass and British Sea Power before them, 1990s’ refusal to be difficult and consistent greatness makes them a hard concept to market. But a fantastic one to listen to.\\" The song \\"You Made Me Like It\\" can be heard in the pilot for Community.

Local tangent plane coordinates (LTP), sometimes named local vertical, local horizontal coordinates (LVLH), are a geographical coordinate system based on the local vertical direction and the Earth's axis of rotation. It consists of three coordinates: one represents the position along the northern axis, one along the local eastern axis, and one represents the vertical position. Two right-handed variants exist: east, north, up (ENU) coordinates and north, east, down (NED) coordinates. They serve for representing state vectors that are commonly used in aviation and marine cybernetics.  Axes  These frames are location dependent. For movements around the globe, like air or sea navigation, the frames are defined as tangent to the lines of geographical coordinates: *East-West tangent to parallels, *North-South tangent to meridians, and *Up-Down in the direction normal to the oblate spheroid used as Earth's ellipsoid, which does not generally pass through the center of the Earth.  Local east, north, up (ENU) coordinates  In many targeting and tracking applications the local East, North, Up (ENU) Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or Geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a \\"Local Tangent\\" or \\"local geodetic\\" plane. By convention the east axis is labeled x, the north y and the up z.  Local north, east, down (NED) coordinates  In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number. The North, East, Down (NED) coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis is labeled x', the east y' and the down z'. To avoid confusion between x and x', etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU. The origin of this coordinate system is usually chosen to be a point on the surface of the geoid below the aircraft's center of gravity. However, care must be taken since, if the aircraft is accelerating (turning or accelerating linearly), then the NED coordinates are no longer inertial coordinates. NED coordinates are similar to ECEF in that they're Cartesian, however they can be more convenient due to the relatively small numbers involved, and also because of the intuitive axes. NED and ECEF coordinates can be related with the following formula: : \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{NED}} = R^\\\\mathsf{T} (\\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{ECEF}} - \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{Ref}}) where \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{NED}} is a 3D position in a NED system, \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{ECEF}} is the corresponding ECEF position, \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{Ref}} is the reference ECEF position (where the local tangent plane originates), and R is a rotation matrix whose columns are the north, east, and down axes. R may be defined conveniently from the latitude \\\\phi and longitude \\\\lambda corresponding to \\\\mathbf p_{\\\\mathrm{Ref}}: : R = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\sin(\\\\phi) \\\\cos(\\\\lambda) & -\\\\sin(\\\\lambda) & -\\\\cos(\\\\phi) \\\\cos(\\\\lambda) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin(\\\\phi) \\\\sin(\\\\lambda) & \\\\cos(\\\\lambda) & -\\\\cos(\\\\phi) \\\\sin(\\\\lambda) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos(\\\\phi) & 0 & -\\\\sin(\\\\phi) \\\\end{bmatrix} See also * Axes conventions * Geodetic system  References  Category:Aerospace Category:Geographic coordinate systems ","title":"Local tangent plane coordinates"},{"id":"5644219","text":"The Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize, established in 1985, is awarded annually as the BC Book Prize for the best non-fiction book by a resident of British Columbia, Canada.

History Soon after Charles Darwin published his theory of Natural Selection, he was faced with a puzzle. If natural selection suggests \\"survival of the fittest,\\" then why do some males have traits that detract from their survival? For instance, the peacock grows a colorful, cumbersome tail that not only attracts predators, but makes it difficult for him to escape those predators. Similarly, the buck grows enormous antlers which are heavy to carry and can easily become tangled in branches, interfering with effective escape from pursuing hunters. Of course, Darwin knew that there was more to natural selection than simple fitness. An equally important part of the struggle of life regards reproduction. In this case, the question becomes, \\"Why would a female burden her offspring with dangerous traits by mating with a similarly burdened male?\\" Noting that the males with burdensome traits are almost entirely those in polygamous species, where a minority of males generally mate with many females, Darwin had an insight. He realized that if females found these male burdens more \\"attractive,\\" and if that attractiveness resulted in more matings by burdened males, then the increase in matings of a few sons might offset the death of many other sons as a result of the burden. In effect, if the success of the surviving males produced enough offspring to cover more than the loss of potential offspring from their lost brothers, then the female who mated with a burdened male had chosen correctly. The female sabotage theory In 1996, however, Joe Abraham presented a re-interpretation of the problem. In polygamous species, males generally contribute nothing to the nurturing of offspring, but nevertheless continue to consume finite resources. In such situations, males effectively become competitors with females and young once they are finished mating. This gives females a reason to sabotage males, and mating gives them an opportunity to do so. By choosing to mate exclusively with males who are unlikely to survive because of their burdens, the females ensure that as the males die, more food and other resources will remain for females and their young. Because females are the limiting resource in most species, as their numbers increase, population fitness will also increase. Just as a given amount of land can only produce a finite amount of grazing, and a limited amount of grazing can only support a limited number of grazing animals, so a given number of grazing animals can only sustain a limited number of predators. Similar limitations apply to all living things, and are known as the carrying capacity of a physical area. If males' burdens are more likely to draw the interest of local predators, then such males effectively shift predation away from females and their young. In this case, the females and young will gain an added benefit from decreased predation, and enjoy even higher rates of survivability. Abraham's explanation reunites the major split in sexual selection—intrasexual competition (male combat) and intersexual selection (female choice)--together under one rubric. Under female sabotage, the increase in resources becomes the critical factor, and the cause of increased male mortality is secondary. The theory also offers new, feminist approaches to leks, harems, resource guarding and mate location. Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Abraham's explanation, however, is that it can easily work with any of the many current theories of sexual selection, and must play some role in them. An increase in resources and a decrease in predation for females and their young is an inevitable result of increased male mortality, regardless of what mechanism drives females to mate with males carrying burdensome traits.

Although the manga avoids openly image of any LGBT-themed content, it is also known because of the easy parody of yaoi and yuri fanservice. Plot The story centers around Akira Sakamoto, who is a part of a very unusual family. Everyone in his family is incredibly beautiful, except him. Compared to the rest of his family, Akira is often overshadowed and feels left out of the rest of the family when they go out in public. Despite this, his family has never tried to distance themselves from him and they treat each other the same way. Akira and his entire family also appear in the series Princess Princess by the same author of Family Complex. Characters ; The main character and the narrator of the story who's 14 years old and a junior at Fujimori Junior High School. He feels that he is the only normal person in his whole family of beauties. He is a supporting character in Princess Princess, another one of Tsuda's works. ; The eldest brother of the family at 17 years old. He's called \\"Sakamoto-sama\\" by his peers at school and could easily be a model. He experiences problems with girls, because, because of his feminine beauty, he enjoys great popularity with most male classmates, many of whom are openly in love with him. ; She is the eldest sister of the family at 16 years old.

He was born at Chailey, East Sussex and died at Deptford. Cricket career Colchin lived in Bromley for several years and was associated with the local Bromley Cricket Club, which was prominent through the 1740s and declined after his death. In addition to his prowess as a single wicket player, Colchin played for Kent in top-class eleven-a-side matches including the famous match against England at the Artillery Ground in 1744.Haygarth, pp. 1–2. Colchin had strong associations with the Artillery Ground and is known to have promoted many matches there, often fielding his own team under the name of Long Robin's XI. Style and technique Colchin was an accomplished single wicket performer. He is held to have been probably the finest all-round player of his day and was called \\"Long Robin\\" because he was so tall: \\"And Robin, from his size, surnamed the Long\\".Ashley-Cooper, At the Sign of the Wicket, 26 April 1900, p. 84. According to a contemporary article about Colchin in The Connoisseur (no. 132, dated 1746): \\"his greatest excellence is cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the Bennetts; and is at length arrived at the supreme dignity of being distinguished among his breathren of the wicket by the title of Long Robin\\". Family and personal life Away from cricket, Colchin chose to lead a shadowy existence among \\"low company\\" and is believed to have been something of an underworld figure.. According to The Connoisseur (see above), Colchin's favourite amusement was attending the executions at Tyburn. He had been \\"born and bred a gentleman, but has taken great pains to degrade himself, and is now as complete a blackguard as those whom he has chosen for his companions\\". The companions are said to include \\"the vulgar\\" among whom Colchin \\"has cultivated an intimacy with Buckhorse (i.e., John Smith, a noted prizefighter), and is very proud of being sometimes admitted to the honour of conversing with the great Broughton himself (Jack Broughton was probably the most famous prizefighter of the 18th century)\\". Colchin died in the last few days of April 1750, aged 36 or 37. He had taken part in an athletics race on 9 April and a contemporary report said he developed a \\"surfeit\\" doing that \\"which threw him into the Small-Pox\\".Maun, p. 203.

History Geography Unguja is a hilly island, about long (north-south) and wide (east-west) at its widest, with an overall area of about . It is located in the southern half of the Zanzibar Archipelago, in the Indian Ocean, about south of the second largest island of the archipelago, Pemba. Unguja and mainland Tanzania are separated by the Zanzibar Channel. Unguja is surrounded by a number of smaller islands and islets, with only two of them, Tumbatu and Uzi, being inhabited. Other minor islands around Unguja include Bawe, Chapwani, Changuu, Chumbe, Kizingo, Kwale, Latham, Mautani, Miwi, Mnemba, Mwana wa Mwana, Nianembe, Popo, Pungume, and Ukanga. Politics Unguja and the surrounding islands are divided into three regions: Zanzibar Central/South (capital: Koani), Zanzibar North (capital: Mkokotoni), Zanzibar Urban/West (capital: Zanzibar City). Unguja belongs to Zanzibar, which is defined by the Tanzanian Constitution as \\"a part\\" of Tanzania with a high degree of autonomy. The local Zanzibari government is based in Stone Town, on the west coast of Unguja. Population As of the 2012 census, the total population of Unguja was 896,721, mostly concentrated in the Zanzibar urban region. The main settlement on the island is Zanzibar City, which serves as a capital for Zanzibar and which includes the renowned historical city of Stone Town as well as other populated areas such as Michenzani. Other major settlements on Unguja include Mbweni, Mangapwani, Chwaka, and Nungwi. People of Unguja mostly speak kiunguja (\\"the language of Unguja\\"), which is the dialect of the Swahili language that was used as the main model for the definition of standard Swahili.Kiunguja Economy Soap made of seaweed Unguja is the island of the Zanzibar Archipelago that has the most developed tourism industry. This accounts for a substantial part of Unguja's economy. Agriculture (including the production of spices such as cloves) and fishing are other relevant activities.

Mukhherjee or H.C. Mukherjee or H.C. Mukherji or H.C. Mukherjee, was the Vice- President of the Constituent Assembly of India for drafting the Constitution of India before Partition of India, and the third Governor of West Bengal after India became a republic with partition into India and Pakistan. He was an educationalist, prominent Christian leader of Bengal, and was the chairman of the Minority rights committee and Provincial constitution committee of the Constituent Assembly—consisting of indirectly elected representatives to draft the Constitution of India, including for provinces of present Pakistan and Bangladesh (then East Bengal) – the assembly considered only Muslims and Sikhs as religious minorities – after India became republic, the same Constituent Assembly became the first Parliament of India in 1947. Biography Born in Bengali family in Bengal, he did MA, PhD, D.Litt, and was the first Indian to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree (from the University of Calcutta). Mookerjee's doctorate was in English literature, and he went on to become a philanthropist, and teacher. At Calcutta University, he served at various positions—as lecturer, secretary, council of Post-Graduate Teaching in Arts, Inspector of Colleges, professor of English from 1936 to 1940, and head of English department. He was later nominated to \\"Bengal Legislative Council\\" and elected to \\"Bengal Legislative Assembly.\\" While he was vice-president of the Constituent Assembly of India, and chairman of the Minority rights sub- committee and Provincial constitution committee, he began suggesting reservation for the upliftment of minorities in all fields, including politics. With partition of India, he changed his stance and limited it to provision for preservation of the language and culture of minorities—over the period, this has been interpreted to open educational institutes and other institutions by minority communities. Following the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Mookerjee was appointed Governor of West Bengal from 1 November 1951 through 7 August 1956. While working as Bengal governor, he served as the president of \\"Desh Bandhu Memorial Society\\" from 1953. He died in office on 7 August 1956 in Calcutta. Christian leader He represented Bengali Christians in Bengal, and after his entry into national politics, he was elected as the president of \\"All India Council of Indian Christians,\\" representing All-Indian Christians other than Anglo-Indians. He was also the member of Indian National Congress and participated in national movements representing Bengali Christian community. He confessed to his community as: He was the only candidate to be unanimously nominated for Vice-Presidency, with a resolution moved by Pattabhi Sitaramayya, a member of Indian National Congress and Constituent Assembly of India; consequently, he expressed his gratitude in the Constituent Assembly of India that met in the Constitution Hall, New Delhi as: See also * Constituent Assembly – India References External links * Minorities Sub-Committee – H.C.

A specialist batsman, he was mainly associated with Kent sides but also represented All- England. Although information about his career is limited by a lack of surviving data, he is known to have made 11 single wicket and 14 eleven-a-side appearances between 1743 and 1751. Cricket career =First mention= The first definite mention of Val Romney is dated Monday, 11 July 1743, when he took part in a single wicket \\"threes\\" match at the Artillery Ground and the six players were stated to be \\"the best in England\\".Ashley-Cooper, p.21. They were William Hodsoll, John Cutbush and Romney playing as Three of Kent; and Richard Newland, William Sawyer and John Bryant playing as Three of All- England. Hodsoll and Newland were the captains. Kent won by 2 runs. The London Evening Post says the crowd was computed (sic) to be 10,000. A return match was arranged at Sevenoaks Vine on Wednesday 27 July but \\"it did not come off\\". =1744 to 1745= Romney was lauded as a \\"mighty play'r\\" (sic) in Cricket, An Heroic Poem (1745) by James Love.Love, Cricket, An Heroic Poem This poem was written to commemorate a celebrated match between Kent and All-England at the Artillery Ground on 18 June 1744,Haygarth, p.1. in which Romney was captain of the Kent XI.Underdown, p.66. In August and September of the same year, Romney played for London Cricket Club as a \\"given man\\" in three matches against Surrey.Ashley-Cooper, p.36. At the end of the 1744 season, Romney played in two \\"threes\\" matches at the Artillery Ground. The first was billed as \\"Long Robin's Side v Richard Newland's Side\\", the teams being Robert Colchin (aka Long Robin), Romney and John Bryant against Richard Newland, Edward Aburrow senior (replacing John Mills) and Joe Harris. The stake was two hundred guineas and the players involved were stated to be the \\"best in England\\". In the second match on Monday, 1 October, the sides were Colchin, James Bryant and Joe Harris versus Romney, John Bryant and Thomas Waymark. In the 1745 season, Romney again played in a major \\"threes\\" match at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 24 June, when he was teamed with Hodsoll and Newland against Colchin, John Bryant and one of the Harris brothers. Hodsoll, Newland and Romney won by 7 runs. The biggest first-class match of the year took place two days later between Long Robin's XI and Richard Newland's XI at the Artillery Ground. Long Robin's XI, including Romney, won \\"by over 70 runs\\". =1746 to 1750= Romney is not mentioned in 1746 sources. In 1747 he played for Kent against All-England on Monday, 31 August, at the Artillery Ground; and on Wednesday, 2 September, on Bromley Common.Ashley-Cooper, p.51. On Saturday, 5 September, there was a \\"threes\\" game at the Artillery Ground billed as \\"Long Robin's Side versus Stephen Dingate's Side\\". The teams were Colchin, John Harris and Romney against Stephen Dingate, Richard Newland and Thomas Jure. It was played for sixty guineas per side and the players were specially chosen from those who had played in the two Kent v All-England games. In 1748, Romney is recorded in two single wicket matches. On Monday, 8 August, he and Colchin opposed Tom Faulkner and Joe Harris at \\"twos\\" in the Artillery Ground for twenty guineas a side.Ashley-Cooper, p.52. On Monday, 29 August, he took part in a \\"fives\\" game at the Artillery Ground in which Tom Faulkner's Side defeated Long Robin's Side by four runs. The prize was 200 pounds. Romney was badly injured and could not run but, the rules being \\"play or pay\\", he was obliged to play as well as he could. The teams were Faulkner, Joe Harris, James Bryant, John Bryant and Durling versus Colchin, Romney, John Larkin, Jones and Maynard. In 1749, Romney made first-class appearances for All- England against Surrey at Dartford Brent and for Long Robin's XI against Stephen Dingate's XI at the Artillery Ground. In July he played for All- England in a \\"fives\\" match\\" against Addington.Ashley-Cooper, p.53. There is just one mention of Romney in 1750 when he played in the Kent side that defeated Surrey by 3 wickets in a first-class match at Dartford Brent.Ashley- Cooper, p.68. =Last known season= 1751 is Romney's last known season although he may have continued for a few years more. Surviving data about matches in the 1750s is scarce. There was a general reduction in matches through the decade caused initially by the deaths of key patrons and then compounded by the impact of the Seven Years' War. Romney made two first-class appearances in May 1751 when he played for Kent against All-England. Kent, weakened by the recent death of Robert Colchin, were well beaten in both games. Val Romney's last recorded appearance was in a single wicket \\"fives\\" match for Kent against Surrey at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 3 June 1751. Kent won \\"although the betting was in favour of Surrey\\".Waghorn, p.26. =Cricket in Romney's time= In Romney's career, the cricket bat was shaped like a modern hockey stick, this being the ideal shape for addressing a ball that was \\"trundled\\" along the ground, as in lawn bowls. The wicket consisted of two stumps and a single bail. Bowlers used the underarm style exclusively but at varying pace. The ball was either rolled along the ground or, if a fast bowler, skimmed across the surface; pitching was not introduced until about 1760, which would have been after Romney retired. Legacy F S Ashley-Cooper says of Romney that \\"he was a most famous player, his name being found in nearly all the great matches of his time\\" and that \\"as a batsman and single wicket player he was very celebrated\\".Ashley-Cooper, p.84. Personal life Romney lived mostly at Sevenoaks and was employed by the 1st Duke of Dorset as head gardener at Knole House, a post later occupied by John Minshull. By 1768, the Sackvilles still rewarded him with a Christmas gratuity of two guineas.Underdown, p.70.

Life Huan Fan was from Pei State (), which is around present-day Suixi County, Anhui. He started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty as a minor official in the office of the Imperial Chancellor, the position held by Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian at the time. Sometime in early 220, he was promoted to Left Supervisor () of the Feathered Forest () section of the imperial guards. Later that year, Cao Cao's son Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian and established the Cao Wei state with himself as the new emperor. Cao Pi put Huan Fan, Wang Xiang () and Liu Shao in charge of writing the Huang Lan (). During the reign of the second Wei emperor Cao Rui ( 226–239), Huan Fan served as a Master of Writing () and Commandant of the Central Army (). Later, he was promoted to East General of the Household () and General Who Attacks Barbarians (), granted imperial authority, and put in charge of overseeing military affairs in Qing and Xu provinces. During his tenure, Huan Fan got into a housing dispute with Zheng Qi (), the Inspector () of Xu Province. He attempted to abuse his powers by executing Zheng Qi, but the latter reported him to the imperial court first, resulting in Huan Fan being dismissed from office. However, Huan Fan was soon recalled to serve in the Wei government, first as the Inspector of Yan Province and later as the Governor of Ji Province. When he saw that Lü Zhao () had reached a higher position than him even though he started serving in the Cao Wei state later than him, he became unhappy and claimed to be ill and stayed at home. During the Zhengshi era (240–249) in the reign of the third Wei emperor Cao Fang, Huan Fan was appointed as the Minister of Finance (). He gained a reputation for being an honest and thrifty official, and was even referred to as \\"a bag of wisdom\\" (). Cao Shuang, the general serving as a regent for the emperor Cao Fang, treated Huan Fan cordially and respectfully, but was not close to him. During his regency, Cao Shuang and his brothers often went out on excursions because they believed that no one posed a threat to them. Huan Fan tried to advise them to be more mindful but they ignored him. In early 249, Cao Shuang and his brothers followed the emperor Cao Fang out of the imperial capital Luoyang to visit the Gaoping Tombs. During their absence, Cao Shuang's co-regent, Sima Yi, used the opportunity to stage a coup d'état against Cao Shuang in Luoyang. He ordered all the gates of Luoyang to be shut and then issued an order to Huan Fan in Empress Dowager Guo's name, ordering him to take command of the troops under Cao Xi (), Cao Shuang's brother. Just as Huan Fan was about to follow the order, his son urged him to side with Cao Shuang instead since Cao Shuang had a political advantage over Sima Yi because the emperor Cao Fang was with him. Huan Fan agreed and headed to Gaoping Tombs, against the advice of his subordinates. He managed to leave Luoyang through the Changping Gate because Si Fan (), the officer guarding the gate, used to serve under him and trusted him when he said he had authorisation to leave. After meeting Cao Shuang and his brothers at Gaoping Tombs, Huan Fan urged them to bring Cao Fang to Xuchang, issue an imperial edict in the emperor's name and denounce Sima Yi as a traitor and call all military forces in the Cao Wei state to attack Sima Yi. He also reassured the Cao brothers that they would not run out of food supplies because he, as the Minister of Finance, had full control over the distribution of food supplies. However, Cao Shuang and his brothers eventually decided to surrender to Sima Yi after Sima Yi promised them that they and their families would not be harmed if they handed over power to him. When Huan Fan heard about it, he cried, \\"How could a hero like Cao Zidan have pigs and dogs like you as his sons? How could he have not foreseen that one day his family will be doomed because of you!\\" After returning to Luoyang, Huan Fan was arrested along with Cao Shuang and his brothers, charged with treason, and executed along with the rest of their families.

It was originally released in 1979 as a 6-track extended EP, dubbed an 'Alternate Play' record (AP) by Safari Records, and was expanded into full-album status the following year. The album was later reissued on CD, cassette and white vinyl by Great Expectations in 1990 (As PIPCD 014), and again on CD by Safari themselves in 2002, digitally remastered and coupled with the band's second album, The Blue Meaning (1980). The album was produced by Steve James and future band member Keith Hale and was released as an AP on 3 August 1979, with the album version following in February 1980. The album was originally compiled by the band's German record label, EMI Electrola, but the importation of the disc was so widespread, Safari decided to cash in and follow suit. The tracks added included several songs which did not make the original track listing and the début single \\"Victims of the Riddle\\" (originally released in July 1979), plus its B-side \\"Victims of the Riddle (Vivisection)\\". The album's title refers to sheep being seen in a field in Finchley just off Regent's Park Road. According to John Craig of Safari, the cover featured Toyah at the RAF Fylingdales radar station near Whitby in Yorkshire, \\"a shoot achieved with considerable difficulty as, quite predictably, guards chased Toyah and the crew from the high-security site\\".

The film stars Clint Eastwood and Bernadette Peters and also has small cameo appearances by Jim Carrey and Bryan Adams.  Plot  A white supremacist group is chasing Lou Ann (Bernadette Peters), whose husband Roy (Timothy Carhart) is a member. She has inadvertently taken counterfeit money from them by running away with his car (the pink Cadillac), which held the supremacists' stash. Tommy Nowak (Clint Eastwood) is a skip-tracer whose speciality is dressing up in disguises, such as a rodeo clown, to fool whomever he is after. Tommy takes on the job of finding Lou Ann because she skipped bail. When he finally finds her in Reno, Nevada, Tommy slowly becomes enamored. Roy and his gang kidnap her baby, whom Lou Ann has left with her sister (Frances Fisher), so Tommy decides to help Lou Ann get the baby back instead of turning her in. While driving through the West, seeking the baby, romance blossoms. They eventually fight the white supremacists and retrieve the baby.

Caryn James wrote: \\"When it's time to look back on the strange sweep of Clint Eastwood's career, from his ambitious direction of Bird to his coarse, classic Dirty Harry character, Pink Cadillac will probably settle comfortably near the bottom of the list. It is the laziest sort of action comedy, with lumbering chase scenes, a dull-witted script and the charmless pairing of Mr. Eastwood and Bernadette Peters.\\" (New York Times, May 26, 1989.) Hal Hinson praised the performers: Peters \\"...plays her comic scenes with a vivacious abandon...\\" She \\"loosens him (Eastwood) up... and humanizes him. These two make a nifty comic team.\\"Hinson, Hal.‘Pink Cadillac’ (PG-13)\\".Washington Post, May 26, 1989 Pink Cadillac was released in May 1989, opening against Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The film eventually grossed $12,143,484.

During the Gold Rush in 1849, a small group of Jews held the first High Holy Days services on the west coast of the United States in San Francisco. This group of traders and merchants founded Congregation Emanu-El sometime in 1850, and its charter was issued in April, 1851. The 16 signatories were mostly German Jews from Bavaria. In 1884 Julie Rosewald became America's first female cantor when she began serving in Emanu- El, although she was not ordained. She served as a cantor there until 1893. As the Reform Movement in Judaism spread in the United States during the early twentieth century, the synagogue became affiliated with this framework. Among its major programs today, the synagogue includes strong support for Israel, with a number of trips and related activities. As with many Reform congregations, there is also a major emphasis on social justice with the congregation's Tzedek Council (social justice council), such as the 2016 Tikkun Tikvah effort to reform California's criminal justice system, and ongoing work to advocate for the rights of refugees and immigrants.

As a highlight in Swedish art history, the Pavilion is a fine example of the European neoclassicism of the late 18th century in Northern Europe.Nilsson, p. 21. Beside the Pavilion lie the \\"Sultan's Copper Tents\\", buildings designed to resemble big tents.  Pavilion  The pavilion was built in 1787 by the architect Olof Tempelman with detailed instructions from King Gustav III who was highly personally involved in the project, producing some basic designs himself and suggesting changes once the work was under way. These changes included extending both wings by the span of two windows. The designer Louis Masreliez– who became a trendsetter in the interior design of the period– was commissioned for the interiors. The pavilion was just one of many great plans and visions that Gustav III had for the Haga Park, many of which made it no further than the drawing board. Gustav III made use of the pavilion for a few years before his assassination. It was from the pavilion that Gustav III left for the fateful masquerade ball at the Opera on 16 March 1792. After the assassination of Gustav III, Duke Charles used the pavilion as his temporary residence. In the 1840s, King Oscar I commissioned a restoration of the building by architect George Theodor Chiewitz. Sculptures and other plasterwork ornamental features were painted grey and added to the façade, which was originally yellow and without decoration. The ionic columns at the gables were replaced by new columns in Italian marble. The glass wall of the Hall of Mirrors was re-worked with new, thin bronze glazing-bars and the outdoor stairway was clad in white marble. The dining room was decorated in a Pompeian style, including the ceiling. The Pavilion underwent a major restoration between 1937 and 1946 under palace architect Ragnar Hjort. During this time, thanks to the discovery of original Masreliez designs for each room, it was possible to restore the interior to its original form. In 2005 the pavilion inspired the design of the music pavilion at Stålboga.  Copper Tents  The Copper Tents in winter. The Sultan's Copper Tents, originally three buildings for the palace guard, designed by the painter Louis Jean Desprez and built during 1787 to 1790. Desprez proposed that all the façades of the buildings should be designed as three Turkish tents, clad in decoratively painted copper plate. However, tent façades were only built on the side facing the main lawns, which still gives the desired illusion of a sultan's encampment on the edge of the forest. The middle tent was destroyed completely by fire in 1953. The front of the tent was rebuilt during 1962 to 1964 under the leadership of palace architect Ragnar Hjorth. The buildings behind the tent façades were rebuilt in 1977-1978, following plans by palace architect Torbjörn Olsson. He turned the stableyard, formerly open, into a tent room with a ceiling. Today the middle copper tent is home to the Haga Park Museum. The tent to the east houses a restaurant and the one on the western side is accommodation. The copper tents are a national monument and protected under law. In 1996, the area comprising Ulriksdal, Haga Park, Brunnsviken and Djurgården became the world's first National City Park. The area is unique by virtue of its natural, cultural and recreational value and its direct proximity to a big city. Mainly administered by the Royal Djurgården Administration, the creation of the National City Park serves to strengthen the prospects of perpetuating the royal historic heritage spanning from Djurgården hunting park to the Gustavian parklands of Haga.

","title":"Gustav III's Pavilion"},{"id":"5644591","text":"Miguel Asín Palacios (July 5, 1871 – August 12, 1944) was a Spanish scholar of Islamic studies and the Arabic language, and a Roman Catholic priest. He is primarily known for suggesting Muslim sources for ideas and motifs present in Dante's Divine Comedy, which he discusses in his book La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia (1919). He wrote on medieval Islam, extensively on al- Ghazali (Latin: Algazel). A major book El Islam cristianizado (1931) presents a study of Sufism through the works of Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi (Sp: Mohidín Abenarabe) of Murcia in Andalusia (medieval Al-Andalus). Asín also published other comparative articles regarding certain Islamic influences on Christianity and on mysticism in Spain. Life Miguel Asín Palacios was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, on July 5, 1871, into the modest commercial family of Don Pablo Asín and Doña Filomena Palacios. His older brother Luis, his younger sister Dolores, and he were little children when their father died of pneumonia. His mother the young widow continued in business with help and made ends meet with decorum but not as well as before. He attended the Colegio de El Salvador instructed by Jesuits in Zaragoza, where he began to make lifelong friendships. He entered the Seminario Conciliar, singing his first Mass at San Cayetano in Zaragoza in 1895.Emilio García Gómez, \\"Don Miguel Asín (1871-1944) Esquema de una biografía\\" in Al-Andalus 9: 266-291, 269 (1944). At the Universidad de Zaragoza Asín had met and begun study under the Arabist Professor Julián Ribera y Tarragó.Asín would later write the long introduction to the jubilación for Prof. Ribera, Disertaciones y Opúsculos (Madrid: Imprenta de Estanislao Maestre 1928), 2 volumes, at I: xv-cxvi. In 1896 at Madrid he defended his thesis on the Persian theologian Ghazali (1058–1111) before Francisco Codera Zaidín and Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo.Emilio García Gómez, \\"Homenaje a Don Francisco Codera: 1836-1917\\" in Al Andalus at 15: 263-274 (1950). All three professors guided his subsequent studies. Asín then developed his study of Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. He also wrote on Mohidin Abenarabe, who is often called the leading figure in Islamic mysticism. Thus Asín was running parallel with a then European-wide effort to understand Muslim inner spirituality.José Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios. Mística cristiana y mística musulmana (Madrid: Ediciones Hiperión 1992) at 19-25, 66.James T. Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (Leiden: Brill 1970) at 176. Professor Codera then retired from his chair in the Arabic Language at the Universidad de Madrid in order to create room there for Asín; Ribera in Zaragoza allowed Asín to leave to assume this Madrid cátedra in 1903. Professor Asín lived in the same well-connected boarding houseThis boarding house was well known for its residents and visitors, past (e.g., Sanz del Rio) and current. The tertulia (discussion group) of Menéndez y Pelayo met there, as did a variety of politicians and their supporters, and the young Duque de Alba (hence Asín's entrée to royalty). Emilio García Gómez, \\"Don Miguel Asín\\" in Al-Andalus 9:266-291 at 274-275 (1944). as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid; together with Asín they soon founded the journal Cultura Española (1906–1909). Asín attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other Arabists and academics in Islamic studies. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of Alfonso XIII.Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 175-178, 129.Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 25-27, 68. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. thumb Asín, is known for his academic work concerning the medieval Muslim-Christian interface of theology, mysticism, and religious practice, with a focus on Spain. His was a form of intellectual history. Among the figures studied were Al-Ghazali, Ibn 'Arabi, Averroës (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Masarra, and Ibn Hazm, as well as the rabbi Maimonides (all from Al-Andalus except al-Ghazali). Asín did comparative work vis-à-vis Islam respecting Ramon Lull, Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Blaise Pascal. Asín's manner of approach was to stick to a theme, to keep circling over it, each time adding to the understanding. His method of work involved meticulous planning, by first conceiving the order of presentation in detail, then straight ahead, without a rough draft (\\"sin borrador\\"), redacted with each reference note on its proper page.Emilio García Gómez, \\"Don Miguel Asín\\" in Al-Andalus 9:266-291 at 284, 287 (1944). In 1932 the journal Al-Andalus began publication under the direction of Asín Palacios; it was technically equipped to satisfy a readership of academic specialists. Asín himself was a frequent contributor. In the universities, a new generation of Spanish Arabists was emerging, such as Emilio García Gómez, influenced by Asín.See the Continuations section below. In 1936 Asín was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936, and caught Asín Palacios while in San Sebastián in the Basque country visiting his nephew and family. The horrors of this struggle remain very painful to contemplate with regard to both sides; over six thousand priests were assassinated by factions of the Second Spanish Republic.https://www.acton.org/publications/transatlantic/2017/11/06/remembering- martyrs-socialism-spanish-civil-war Asín was in personal danger, yet that September nationalist forces captured San Sebastián. During the war he taught Latin and managed to obtain photocopies of Arabic texts.Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 34-35.Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 192.Emilio García Gómez, \\"Don Miguel Asín\\" in Al-Andalus 9:266-291 at 284-285 (1944). After the trauma of Civil War, Asín was able to return to Madrid and resume his professorship at the university. There he continued his duties and his work on his multi-volume study of Al-Ghazali. Don Miguel Asín Palacios had intense black eyes, fine hands; photographs did not seem to capture his personality or expressions. He was well dressed (\\"entre cardenal y torero\\"). Not ambitious but for the tranquility in which to work, he was a good and generous friend. His colleagues recognized in him an enduring innocence, so that he was \\"not knowing\\" in the mixed turbulence of the world.García Gómez affectionately commented that Asín sometimes would appear \\"un poco en la luna\\". \\"Don Miguel Asín (1873-1944) Esquema de una biografía\\" in Al-Andalus 9:266-291 at 289 (1944). One may conjecture whether Prof. García Gómez tended to type his teacher. He projected a brightness (\\"diafanidad\\"); his mind had developed to become a great work of refinement. A pious priest, an admirer of John Henry Newman, \\"a child of 73 years\\" when he died.Emilio García Gómez, \\"Don Miguel Asín (1873-1944) Esquema de una biografía\\" in Al-Andalus 9:266-291 at 287-289 (1944). He died on August 12, 1944, in San Sebastián. His passing prompted many scholars to review his work.See bibliography below. Works Following early publications on Al- Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi as noted above, Asín Palacios discussed, edited and rendered into Spanish translation many Arabic writings, and composed books and essays on related themes, including an occasional piece in Latin, French, or Italian.See \\"Selected Publications\\" section below. For descriptions of different critiques of Asín's works generally, see Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 147-175; also the \\"Selected Commentary\\" section, infra. =Aquinas and Averroës= Thomas Aquinas, sculpture (17th century). Ibn Rushd (Averroës), detail from the painting Triunfo de Santo Tomás by Andrea da Bonaiuto. Asín Palacios researched Muslim influence on Tomás d'Aquino (c. 1225-1274), which would most likely come from the philosopher Ibn Rushd of Córdoba (1126–1198), whether as protagonist or antagonist. Ibn Rushd came to be written Averroës in Latin. The result was the 1904 article, \\"El Averroísmo teológico de Santo Tomás de Aquino\\" by Asín, the professor from Zaragoza newly arrived in Madrid.Originally published in Homenaje a D. Francisco Codera en su jubilación del profesorado. Estudios de erudición oriental (Zaragoza: Escar 1904) at 271-331; reprinted in the collection of Asín's articles, Huellas del Islam (1941), at 11-72. With respect to Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotle, Asín infers that the religio-philosophic world inhabited by Averroës is analogous to that of Aquinas, and also to that of ben Maimon or Maimonides (1135–1204) the Jewish philosopher and talmudist, also from Córdoba.Asín Palacios, \\"El Averroísmo\\" (1904), in Huellas del Islam (1941), e.g., cf., section III at 49, also VI at 63-64. Asín understood that it was with piety that Averroës used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes this issue for the sake of clearly distinguishing Averroës from several of the not-so-pious Latin \\"Averroístas\\".Asín, \\"El Averroísmo\\" (1904), in Huellas del Islam (1941), III at 43, 45-46, especially 49; see also II at 21, and again V at 60.Earlier Asín quoted rather extensively from Averroës, his Kitab al-Tahafut (ed. Cairo A.H.1303), and the Kitab al-falsafat Ibn Rusd (ed. Cairo AH.1313), which contains two works including Fasl al-maqal (Doctrina decisiva). Asín, \\"El Averroísmo\\" (1904) in Huellas (1941), II at 21-41. Asín also refers to medieval voluntarism (called asaries in Islam), in order to contrast and distinguish the similar rationalisms held by Averroës and by Aquinas.\\"El Averroísmo\\" (1904), in Huellas del Islam (1941), IV at 52, V at 57-60. Duns Scotus (1266-1308) was an advocate of voluntarism.Asín understood that Santo Tomás and Ibn Rusd, rather than legendary enemies, shared a similar task that encumbered their age, i.e., to reconcile faith and reason. Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 104-107, 104. Yet, many Thomists did not then accept without great controversy Asín's point of view.P. Chalmeta Gendrón, \\"Asín Palacios, Miguel\\" in Gran Enciclopedia Rialp [GER] (1991) GER. As a medieval tactician, St. Thomas did write his De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averroistas [Paris 1270], translated as On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists (Marquette Univ. 1968); cf., Etienne Gilson, The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy (New York: Scribners 1936) at 176-178, 182-183. Nonetheless, what Asín presents here may be considered a modernist view point through a wide-angle lens, a philosophical anthropology. =Ibn Masarra= In his 1914 book, Abenmasarra y su escuela. Orígenes de la filosofía hispano- musulmana,Translated by Douglas and Yoder as The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1978).For Asín's Abenmasarra (1914) in general, see: Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 107-114; James Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (1970) at 180-182; and the somewhat sceptical Claude Addas, Quest for the Red Sulphur (1993) at 57-59. Asín opens by describing the evolution of Islamic philosophy and cosmology at the center of Islamic civilization in the East, in comparison with its later emergence in Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia).Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978), Chapters I [1-14] and II [15-29]. A brief biography of Ibn Masarra (883-931) follows. There Asín posits the continuation of pre- existing Iberian culture among Hispanic natives who, following its conquest, converted to Islam. Because of Abenmasarra's father's client status (to his Berber mawla), Asín infers that he was such a Muslim 'Spaniard' (a muladi). Asín describes his affinity to Greek philosophy, i.e., neoplatonism, then notes the accusations of heresy against him, and that he early concealed his teachings.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978), Chap. III [30-42]: at 30 (continuity of thought), at 30-31 (father's client status), at 32 (his early ideas [received from his father]). At the time the Umayyad Emir Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi challenged by political unrest, and armed rebels such as 'Umar ibn Hafsun, showed little tolerance for religious dissenters such as Abenmasarra.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978), Chap. III: at 33-34 ('Umar ibn Hafsun), 33-35 (political oppression).J. Spencer Trimingham, The Sufi Orders in Islam (Oxford University 1971) at 46: > \\"In Spain, although there was a brief flowering associated with Ibn Masarra > (AD 883-931) and his pupils, Sufism could not thrive openly in the > atmosphere of intolerance and suspicion that prevailed there. Ibn Masarra's books were later burned in public during the year 951. Claude Addas, \\"Andalusi Mysticism and the rise of Ibn 'Arabi\\" at 909-933, 918, in The Legacy of Muslims Spain (Leiden: Brill 1992). Ibn Masarra felt compelled to flee, traveling to Qairawan and Mecca. He eventually returned to Córdoba under the tolerant rule of the Umayyad caliph Abd ar-Rahman III (r.889/91-961), where he founded a School with elements of Sufism.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978), Chap. III [30-42]: at 35-38 (ostracism by pressure from the Córdoba faqih), 36-37 (travels), 38-41 (Ibn Masarra's return to Córdoba and his \\"tariqah\\"), 41 (his books). The Umayyad Abd ar-Rahman III (891-961) (r.912-961) in 929 became the first Caliph of Córdoba.Using newly discovered sources, Ibn Masarra is called a \\"Neoplatonist philosopher\\" of the Qur'an by Ahmet Karamustafa in his Sufism. The formative period (University of California 2007), at 72; Asín heads the long list of his references at note 63 (pp.80-81). Ibn Gabirol, influenced by Ibn Masarra's school. Due to a lack of extant works by Ibn Masarra of Córdoba available to Asín, his book treats the general context of the School and teachings of early Muslim mystics in al- Andalus.In 1914 Asín thought that not a single work of Ibn Masarra nor any fragments survived [The Mystical Philosophy at IV:43]. Asín inferred his school's original teachings based on, for example, medieval biographers (al- Faradi, al-Dabbi, Ibn Khaqan, and al-Maqqari [III:32,n.6]), two Iberian commentators (Ibn Hazm, and Sa'id of Toledo) [IV:43; VI:73], and on the writings of his followers (in particular Ibn 'Arabi) [IV:43-44; VI:73] and of his adversaries.Subsequently, two manuscripts of Ibn Masarra have been located (Kitab al-huruf [Book of Letters], & Kitab al-tabsira [Book of Clear Explanation]); very recently both have been translated into Spanish by Pilar Garrido. Cf., P. Garrido, \\"The Science of Letters in Ibn Massara\\" in Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society 47: 47-61, at 48. Asín [Mys. Phil. at III:41,n.23] knew of these titles only from references to them by others, for example, Ibn Hazm.These works of Ibn Masarra are discussed by Claude Addas, \\"Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn 'Arabi\\" at 909-933, 916-918, in The Legacy of Muslim Spain (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1992), edited by Salma Khadra Jayyusi. Asín discusses the Batini, the Mutazili, the Shi'a, the Sufi, the Greco-Roman mystic Plotinus (205-270), and Pseudo-Empedocles in particular.Asín's theory that the pseudo-Empedocles was a source for Ibn Masarra's teachings has been challenged. Cf., Claude Addas, her Ibn 'Arabi ou La quéte du Soufre Rouge (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by Peter Kingsley as Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 57-58, and the article by the Ismaili scholar Samuel Miklos Stern, cited there at note 113. Elsewhere Addas states, \\"[T]he possible influence exerted by Eastern [Muslim] mystics on Ibn Masarra [is] a more decisive influence, in my view, than any pseudo-Empedocles might have had.\\" Addas, \\"Andalusi Mysiticism and the rise of Ibn 'Arabi\\" at 909-933, 914, 918, in The Legacy of Muslim Spain (Leiden: Brill 1992).But compare the pseudo-Empedocles named by Shem Tob Falaquera (1225-1290) in discussing Ibn Gabirol (1021-1058), cited by Isaac Husik in his A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941), at 60-61, 64. Mentioned several times by Asín is a perspective he favored: eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west.Asín, Abenmasarra y su escuela (1914), translated as The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers (1978), for example, at 2-3, 12-13, 28, 88-89, 91 (and in Asín's prior works referenced at 12, footnote 25).Confirmation of Asín's perspective appears to be given in a later book by the scholar Margaret Smith, Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at Chap.VI, 103-124.Cf., R.C.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (Univ.of London 1960; reprints: Schocken 1969, Oneworld 1994) at 86-87, 92, 112. Asín infers that Ibn Masarra's school influenced Ibn al-Arif (1088–1141) of Almería.Asín's inference is based on an admitted dearth of 10th-century sources but indirectly on later Muslims of al-Andalus, i.e., on Ibn 'Arabi, whose own early writings drew heavily on the circle formed by Ibn al'Arif. Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:122-123. This Ibn al-'Arif became the focus of an emerging Sufi circle later called the muridin. His followers spread out over al-Andalus, but they became too strong in the opinion of the governing power;One muridin shaikh managed to set up a rival government in the Algarves. This Abu 'l-Qasim \\"demonstrated how easily spiritual power can aspire to mundane power when he rose from his rabat [fort], [the year Ibn al- Arif died], and subjected [lands in Southern Portugal] before he was killed in 546/1151.\\" Trimingham, The Sufi Orders in Islam (1971) at 46. they were variously suppressed by the Almoravids who then ruled al-Andalus from Marrakech.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:121-123 (Ibn al-'Arif and his circle). The Berber Almoravids deported Ibn al-'Arif to Marrakech, where he was accused of heterodoxy and died in 1141. His follower Ibn Qasi managed to escape, to organize adepts into a militia under the mystic name muridin, and to prosecute a sustained revolt. Ibid. at VIII:122. Asín then discusses the influence of the school on Jewish figures of al-Andalus, for example, Judah ha-Levi (c. 1085-c. 1140),Cf., Isaak Heinemann, editor, \\"Jehuda Halevi: Kusari\\", in Three Jewish Philosophers (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America c. 1946; reprint by Atheneum 1969). and in particular on Solomon ibn Gabirol (c. 1021-1058), known in Latin as Avicebron.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131 (ibn Gabirol, aka Avicebron) and 129 (Judah ha-Levi).Cf., Isaac Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941) at 59-79 (Solomon ibn Gabirol), and 150-183 (Judah Halevi). Ibn Gabirol wrote in Arabic the book Fons Vitae which still survives.Fons Vitae being the book's well-known title in its Latin translation, meaning \\"Fountain of Life\\". It apparently shows clear neo-Platonic references to the school of Ibn Masarra.Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131. Regarding Ibn Gabirol, Asín cites to the near contemporary writings of Shem-Tob b. Joseph Falaquera, and also references to 19th-century scholarship by David Kaufmann, Studien über Salomon Ibn Gabirol (Budapest 1899) at 52-58, and Solomon Munk, Mélanges de Philosophie Juive et Arabe (Paris 1859) at 241 [generally 151-306]. Munk made the then surprising discovery that it was Ibn Gabirol who wrote the Fons Vitae. Asín (1914, 1978) at VIII:130.Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (1941) at 60, 63-64. Asín points to the impact of these Muslim and Jewish thinkers of Spain regarding medieval Christian theology, for example, the long drawn-out struggle between the Aristotilean ideas of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) and those of Duns Scotus (1266–1308).The Mystical Philosophy at VIII:144-145. Asín's dogged research, on the persistent influence of Ibn Masarra's school of mystical philosophy, leads him to follow its tracks eventually to Ibn 'Arabi (1165–1240),Ibn 'Arabi wrote that Ibn Masarra was \\"one of the greatest masters of the Way in terms of knowledge, spiritual state and revelation.\\" Claude Addas, Quest for Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi (Cambridge: Islamic Text Society 1993) at 58, citing the Futuhat of Ibn 'Arabi at I: 147. as well as to Ramon Lull (1233–1315) and to Roger Bacon (c. 1214-c. 1294).Asín, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at 73-82, 123-143, 173-183 (Ibn 'Arabi); at 136-144, 173-183 (Ramon Lull); at 134-137, 144 (Roger Bacon). Asín quoted from Bacon's Opus majus as edited by Jebb, at 26: \\"Philosophy comes through the influence of divine illumination.\\" Bacon later refers to \\"the Muslims\\" and, at 46, to the \\"illumination\\" taught by the Persian philosopher Ibn Sina [Avicenna]. The Mystical Philosophy at VIII:136 n.48. Later another scholar would find evidence that may link the school of Ibn Masarra to the philosopher of light [al-Ishraq] and mystic of Iran, Suhrawardi (c. 1155-1191).Independently, Henry Corbin in his L'imagination créatrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated as Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi (Princeton Univ. [Bollingen] 1969), \\"saw\\" connections, through the alam al-mithal [subtle world] [35-36] and perhaps via Ibn 'Arabi, between the school of Ibn Masarra and the mystical philosophy of Muslim Iran, for example, Suhrawardi's Ishraq [light]. Corbin (1958, 1969) at 25-26, 48-49; cf., 367-368. Corbin cites Asín here, and elsewhere.Cf., Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi, The Mystical & Visionary Treatises of Suhrawardi, translated with an introduction by W. M. Thackston, Jr. (London: The Octagon Press 1982). Asín's 1914 Abenmasarra y su escuela established a lasting influence on subsequent scholarship.\\"It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of this work, which has exerted a decisive and lasting influence on the whole approach taken toward Andalusi Sufism by orientalists.\\" [Emphasis added]. Claude Addas, \\"Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn 'Arabi\\" at 909-933, 912, in The Legacy of Muslim Spain (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1992), edited by Salma Khadra Jayyusi. Regarding Asín, the sometimes mistaken yet respected 'pioneer', cf., 912-913, 919-920. She discusses Ibn Masarra at 911-919. =Dante Alighieri= Statue of Dante Alighieri, at Palazzo degli Uffizi, Florence. Perhaps Asín Palacios is best remembered for his 1919 book, La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia,[Muslim eschatology in the Divine Comedy]. See below under \\"Selected Publications\\" for details on its editions.Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 118-120, 150-160.Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (1970) at 182-184. which sparked lively and extended discussions among Dante scholars. Asíin here suggests Islamic sources for the theological landscapes used by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) in his work La Divina Commedia,Dante's admiration for Islamic philosophy was clear from his \\"favorable\\" placement of the philosophers Ibn Rushd (Averroës) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) in the poem. Cf., Frederick Copleston, A History of Philosophy, vol. 2, Mediaeval Philosophy at Part 1: 225-226; and at Part 2: 161 (Westminster MD: Newman Press 1950; reprint [in two parts] by Doubleday/Image 1962).Asín refers to his own precursors regarding Dante, for example, Bruno Nardi. Asín, La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia (Madrid-Granada: Escuelas de Estudios Árabes, segunda edición, 1943) at 4; & 397-399, 452. written c.1308 to 1320.R. W. B. Lewis, Dante (New York: Viking 2001), p. 101 (1308 or 1309 start), p. 189 (1320 finish). Specifically, Asín compares the Muslim religious literature surrounding the night journey [al-'Isra wal- Mi'rag] of Muhammad (from Mecca to Jerusalem and thence up with the prophets through the seven heavens),The Mi'raj or night journey [mi'ray in Spanish] is briefly mentioned in the Qur'an at the sura so named (XVII, 1-2), and perhaps alluded to twice more (LIII,1; LXXXIV, 19).The Mi'raj is described authoritatively in Hadith, for example, of Sahih Muslim, whose text in English can be found in Early Muslim Mysticism edited by Michael A. Sells (Paulist Press 1996) at 49-53.The Mi'raj is also described by Ibn Ishaq (A.H. 85-151) in his \\"biography\\" of the prophet, in Alfred Guillaume (ed.), The Life of Muhammad. A translation of Ishaq's \\"Sirat Rasul Allah\\" (Oxford University 1955) at 181-187.Geo Widengren, Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and his Ascension (Uppsala 1955), for example, at 96-114. with Dante's story describing his spiritual journey in which he meets various inhabitants of the afterlife and records their fate.Dante, The Divine Comedy (New York: New American Library 1954), translated by John Ciardi.

Prior to Asín's La Escatologia it was assumed that Dante drew from the long poem the Aeneid by the ancient Roman poet Virgil for the inspiration to create the memorable scenes of the afterlife.In Virgil's Aeneid, Book VI, lines 301-447, the hero Aeneas enters the underworld, and later visits his deceased father Anchises (lines 910-972), who shows Aeneas a vision of the future, and of Rome (lines 973-1219). In his Divina Comedia, Dante himself plays the leading role; he is guided by the deceased poet Virgil as they travel through the Inferno and the Purgatorio.Dante, The Inferno (New York: New American Library 1954; reprint Mentor Books), Canto 1, lines 61-84 (Dante meets Virgil, who acts as his guide).Dante, Purgatorio (New York: New American Library 1954; reprint Mentor), Canto XXX, lines 46-56 (his guide Virgil disappears), lines 55-75 (replaced by Beatrice).R. W. B. Lewis, Dante (New York: Viking 2001), pp. 102-104 (Virgil and Beatrice, as guides); 113-114 (Virgil's role), regarding the Divine Comedy. Asín remarks that the addition of the Muslim sources in no way detracts from Dante's achievement, and that Dante remains a luminous figure and his poem retains its exalted place in world literature.Asín Palacios, La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia (2d ed., 1943), for example, at 420 (el \\"inspirado\\" florentino que por \\"su poema inmortal\\" alcanzó \\"enamorados de la belleza de su arte exquisito\\"). Asín's book inspired a wide and energetic reaction, both positive and negative, as well as further research and academic exchanges.See \\"Commentary\\" section, regarding: Massignon, G. Gabrieli, Guillaume, Arnold, Levi della Vida, Cerulli, Muñoz Sendino, F. Gabrieli.See also Asín's response to his critics, \\"Historia y crítica de una polémica\\" (1924).Cf., Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 150-160. Eventually two scholars, an Italian and a Spaniard, independently uncovered an until-then buried Arabic source, the 11th-century Kitab al-Mi'raj [Book of the Ladder (or of the ascent)],José Muñoz Sendino, La Escala de Mahoma, tradución del árabe al castellano, latín y francés, ordenada por Alfonso X el sabio (Madrid 1949). Muñoz Sendino also wrote the prólogo to La escala de Mahoma (Madrid 1949).Concurrent work by Enrico Cerulli, Il \\"Libro della Scala\\" e la questione della fonti arabo-spagnole della Divina Commedia (Vatican 1949). which describes Muhammad's night journey. This work was translated into Spanish as La Escala de Mahoma [The Ladder of Muhammad] by a scribe (Abrahim Alfaquim) of the Spanish king Alfonso X el Sabio in 1264.Regarding the translations made by this royal scriptorium of Alfonso X (r.1252-1284), cf., Escuela de Traductores (in English). Information also surfaced about another translation of it into Latin, Liber Scalae Machometi, which has been traced to the Italian milieu of the poet, Dante Alighieri.Francesco Gabrieli, \\"New lignt on Dante and Islam\\", in East & West, IV: 173-180 (Rome 1953) at 175-176. This article includes a review of the prior scholarship of Cerulli and Muñoz Sendino.Gérman Sepúlveda, Influencia del Islam en la Divina Comedia (Santiago de Chile: Instituto Chileno-Arabe de Cultura 1965). Evidently Dante's mentor Brunetto Latini met the Latin translator of the Kitab al-Mi'raj while both were staying at the court of king Alfonso X el Sabio in Castilla.As reported, in 2000 Maria Corti discussed Dante's Italian mentor Brunetto Latini (1220-1294), that he met Bonaventura de Siena, thought to be the Latin translator of the Kitab al-Mi'raj, at the court of Alfonso X of Spain. Cf., Dante e l'Islam (Italian interview with Maria Corti, April 2000). Latini's trip was probably circa 1259; he returned to Tuscany in 1266. Dante wrote La Divina Commedia much later, in his last years, 1308-1321. Prof. Corti comments on our 'surprise' if Latini had given Dante a copy of the translation.Cf., Ramón Menéndez Pidal, España, eslabón entre la Cristiandad y el Islam (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1956, 2d ed. 1968) at 59-60, where he further corroborates this connection.Cf., Julia Bolton Holloway, \\"The Road through Roncesvalles: Alfonsine formation of Brunetto Latini and Dante-- Diplomacy and Literature,\\" 109-123, e.g., at 109, 112, 123, in Robert I. Burns, editor, Emperor of Culture. Alfonso X the Learned of Castile and his thirteenth-century Renaissance (University of Pennsylvania 1990). Although this missing link was not available to Asín, he had based his work on several similar accounts of Muhammad's ladder then circulating among the literary or pious Muslims of Al-Andalus.Asín Palacios, La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia (2d ed., 1943), especially in Part I at chapters 2 & 3, and translations in the first Appendix. Regarding Ibn 'Arabi: his derivative work, at 76-77, 79-84, 181-184; Asín's comparison of him with Dante, at 399-412, 417-418; and Asín's epilogue, at 418-421. =Ibn Hazm= The importance of Ibn Hazm of Córdoba (994-1064) to the Muslim culture of Spain was earlier recognized by Asín. He had outlined Ibn Hazm's influence on medieval Islam,Asín, Discursos leídos ante la Real Acadamia de la Historia en la receptión publica del señor D. Miguel Asín Palacios el día 18 de mayo de 1924 (Madrid 1924). Cited by Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (1970) at 186. and had published a study with translation which addressed his ethical thought,Asín, Los caracteres y la conducta, tratado de moral práctica por Abenházam de Córdoba (Madrid 1916), an ethical study by Asín, which translates Ibn Hazm's Akhlaq. followed by a volume concerning Ibn Hazm's views on religious history.Asín, El Cordobés Abenházam, primer historador de las ideas religiosas (Madrid: Estanislao Maestre 1924). During his career, Ibn Hazm became a remarkable figure, not least for the wide scope of his abilities, e.g., producing significant writings as a theologian, as a jurist,Ibn Hazm was then a leading Zahiri jurist, whose influence was lasting. Cf., Knut S. Vikor, Between God and Sultan. A History of Islamic Law (Oxford University 2005) at 117-119. and as a poet.His poetry appears in annotated translations by Asín's former student, Emilio García Gómez, in his El collar de la poloma, tratato sobre el amor y los amantes de Ibn Hazm de Córdoba (Madrid 1952).Also the English translation of A. R. Nykl, The Dove's Neck-Ring (Paris 1931).Such medieval Arabic poetry influenced the troubadours. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, España, Eslabón entre la Christiandad y el Islam (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1956, 1968) at 17-18 (citing Asín). Mezquita at Córdoba. From 1927 to 1932, Asín published a 5-volume study, Abenházam de Córdoba y su historia crítica de las ideas religiosas [Ibn Hazm of Cordoba and his \\"Critical History of Religious Ideas\\"].Citations here to Asín's Abenházam (1927-1932) are generally to the reprint by Ediciones Turner (Madrid, 1984), also 5 volumes.For a contemporaneous review by Ángel González Palencia, see Al Andalus at I: 213-214 (1933). Asín's first volume presents a biography, including his life as a jurist/politician and his trail through the world of intellect; Asín here gives a critique of the writings of the medieval Spanish Muslim, focusing on Ibn Hazm as a theologian and as an early historian of religions.Thus Asín did not intend to elaborate on his poetry, his jurisprudence, his political history, or his ethics, as these subjects had already been addressed by others, for example, Nykl, Goldziher, Dozy, and Asín himself. Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932) at I: 9. Yet Asín's bibliography, at I: 246-279, provides a catalogue of Ibn Hazm's works in Philosophy, Jurisprudence, Theology, History, and Literature.Monre, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (Leiden: E.J.Brill 1970) at 187. The remaining four volumes comprise an incomplete yet lengthy translation of Ibn Hazm's Fisal,Asín does not translate the entire text; for various sections he provides only a summary with analysis.Roger Arnaldez criticized Asín as a translator of Ibn Hazm's Fisal for not sufficiently entering into the Islamic language and its special environment, and for \\"Christianizing\\" some lexicon. Arnáldez, Grammaire et théologie chez Ibn Hazm de Cordoue. Essai sur la structure et les conditions de la pensee musulman (Paris 1956) at 320. Nonetheless Arnáldez approved of Asín's biography and of his respectful commentary on Ibn Hazm. Cited by Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín (1992) at 160-161. a very long work on the history of religious ideas, its Arabic title being Kitab al-Fisal fi al-milal wa-al-ahwa' wa-al-nihal [Book of Separation. Concerning Religions, Heresies, and Sects].Ibn Hazm's Fisal became well-known, for example, it is cited by Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) in his Muqaddimah, e.g., at the end of section 25 on the Shi'a (Rosenthal's 1958 translation, v.1 at 414).On the Kitab al-Fisal, cf., Reynold A. Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs (London: T. Fisher Unwin 1907; reprint: Cambridge University 1962) at 427-428. Ibn Hazm's Fisal has six parts: 1. non-Muslim religions (in Asín's volumes II-III), 2. Muslim sects (Asín's III-IV), 3. Muslim faith and theology (IV), 4. several constitutional questions regarding Islamic government (V), 5. Muslim heresies (V), 6. theology in 29 questions (V). In part 1 of the Fisal, Ibn Hazm gives a polemical description of Christian scriptures and trinitarian doctrine, its putative errors and contradictions, showing familiarity with the texts. He also comments on Judaism, Zarathustra,About Zoroastro and his religion (II: 127-131, 231-237), Ibn Hazm acknowledges them as people of the book (II: 233), yet whose sacred writings have been alterred--like those of Jews and Christians (II: 233, 237). Brahmans, sophists, atheists, and polytheists. According to Asín, many subsequent anti-Christian polemics by Muslims more or less followed part I of Ibn Hazm's Fisal.Asín, Discursos leídos ante la Real Acadamia de la Historia (Madrid 1924). Cf., Monroe, Islam and the Arabs (1970) at 186.Cf., Abdelilah Ljamai, Ibn Hazm et la polémique Islamo-chrétienne dans l'Histoire de l'Islam (Leiden: Brill 2003), e.g., the Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328) at 175-183.Cf., Ignaz Goldziher, Die Zâhiriten (Leipzig 1884), translated by W.Behn as The Zahiris. Their Doctrine and their History (Leiden 1971). Goldziher makes a reference to \\"Ibn Hazm who distinguishes himself by his fanatical enmity against everything non-Islamic.\\" Goldziher (1971) at 56; also at 60, \\"his personal fanaticism against followers of other religions\\"; and at 122. Asín, in his \\"Disertación preliminar\\" to the Fisal, compares the late emergence of comparative religious history in Christian Europe with its relative early start in Islam, noting the geographical proximity of Islam to a variety of differing religions.Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932) at II: 7-79. For example, an early Islamic work that discusses Buddhism appeared in the 9th century.This being the Fihrist, which sets out its perceptions about Buddhism, its sects, cults, monastic orders, ceremonies, temples. Asín, Abenházam de Córdoba (1927-1932) at II: 16.Relevant here is a near contemporary Zoroastrian work, the Shikand-gumanic Vichar, a synchronic approach to differing religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) with an evident polemical purpose. Yet Asín more than once refers to Ibn Hazm as the first historian of religions.Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932) at II: 33-79. Asín Palacio's biography shows Ibn Hazm as once vizier to the declining Umayyad caliphs before retiring to his study.Cf., Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932) at I: 136; compare, at 227. During the course of his career Ibn Hazm had become a Muslim jurist of the Zahiri (or \\"literalist\\") school of law.Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932) at I: 5; discussion in his chapter X, \\"Abenházam, Jurista Xafeí\\" at I: 121-130, and chapter XI, \\"Abenházam, Jurista Dahirí\\" at I: 131-144. Yet the Maliki was the madhhab which prevailed in al- Andaluz.Generally: Ignaz Goldziher, Die Zâhiriten (Leipzig 1884), translated by W.Behn as The Zahiris. Their Doctrine and their History (Leiden 1971). Goldziher recognizes Ibn Hazm: \\"Among the champions of the Dawudi [Zahiri] school this remarkable man is known as the most famous by far.\\" Goldziher (1971) at 109. His legal treatise on fiqh, Ibtal,Longer title: Ibtal al-qiyas wa-al-ra'y wa-al-istihsan wa-al-taqlid wa-al-ta'wil [Refutation of analogy, learned opinion, social equity, juristic authority, and 'insight' text interpretation]; title in Spanish per Asín: \\"Libro que de muestra la inanidad del uso de estos cinco criterios jurídicos: el argumento de analogía, la opinión personal, la equidad o preferencia, la autoridad de los maestros y la investigación del espiritu de la ley\\". Listed in Asín's biography in his Abenházam (1927-1932) at I: 259; cf., his chapter XI, \\"Abenházam, Jurista Dahirí\\" at I: 131-144. is referenced by Asín and regards the Zahiri rejection of the heuristic use of analogy, learned opinion, social equity, juristic authority, and 'spirit' of the law, as unacceptable legal method.Asín, Abenházam (1927-1932), at I: 140-144. Late in his Fisal, as a jurist Ibn Hazm addresses possible rebellion against an unjust Imam; the distinction is made between not obeying an unjust order and taking action to overthrow an unjust ruler.At part 4 of the Fisal (Asín's volume V, at 7-51), at chapter 4, which Asín entitles \\"Necessity of the Imam\\" (Asín at 34-43). Ibn Hazm enters another controversy, opining that women may be given inspiration by God, referring to the \\"mujer de Abraham\\" (i.e., Sarah) and to the \\"madre de Jesús\\" María (like Mahoma visited by the \\"ángel Gabriel\\").Asín, Abenházam de Córdoba (1927-1932) in vol.V: 175-180 (part 6, Ch.4), at 177-179. After publication of Asín's 5-volume study, additional writings of Ibn Hazm were discovered in the library of the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul, including legal responsa, to which Asin devoted an article.\\"Un Códice inexplorada de Cordobés Ibn Hazm\\" in Al Andalus, 2: 1-56 (1934). =Ibn 'Arabi= Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabī Arabic: ابن عربي Spanish: Abenarabi. Another work by Asín, which became well known to scholars of Islam, addresses the life and the sufi philosophy of Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi (1165–1240) of the Iberian city of Murcia. Asín Palacios had already written a number of studies and translations of Ibn 'Arabi, the revered (and controversial) mystic,Six prior articles (1899, 1906, 1925, 1926, 1926, 1928) of Asín are listed in El Islam cristianizado at p.6 note 1, as well as the discussion of Ibn 'Arabi in his 1919 book on Dante. Several later articles by Asín are cited in Al Andalus, V: 239-241, 240 (1940), where Asín reviews A.E.Affifi's The Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid Din Ibnul Arabi (1939); therein Asín refers to Ibn 'Arabi as \\"profound, knowledgeable and erudite, complicated and subtle, well versed in all the Islamic systems of thought.\\" Ibid. at 241. but his major work was El Islam cristianizado. Estudio del sufismo a través de las obras de Abenarabi de Murcia (Madrid 1931).For details see \\"Selected Publications by Asín\\" below, under \\"Books\\".See the discussions in: Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 127-136, 162-174; Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 188-189; Addas, Quest for the Red Sulphur, mixed at 1-10.Henry Corbin remarks on Asín's title El Islam cristianizado: > \\"The pious sentiment which inspired the great Spanish Arabic scholar with > this strange title is perceptible throughout the work, which is still of the > utmost value. But it is regrettable that he should have applied language and > ideas befitting a Christian monk to a Sufi like Ibn 'Arabi; their vocations > are different, and in employing such a method one runs the risk of blurring > the originality of both types.\\" Corbin, L'imagination créatrice dans le > Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated by Ralph Manheim > as Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi (Princeton Univ. > [Bollingen] 1969) at 39 n.12. Following an introduction that proposes that Sufism emerged from the influence of Christian monasticism on Islam, the book presents three parts: first, a short life of Ibn 'Arabi [31-118]; second, commentaries that approach the complexity of his voluminous writings, his mystical teachings, his place in sufism, and his subsequent influence [119-274]; third, selections translated from seven of Ibn 'Arabi's works, including the Meccan Fotuhat [275-518].Works translated by Asín: Tohfa (Regalo para el Viaje a la Corte de la Santidad) [277-299], Amr (La regla taxativa que fija las condiciones que deben cumplir los que siguen el camino de Dios) [300-351], Tadbirat (Polítical Divina en el Gobierno del Reino Humano) [352-377], Cunh (Epístola sobre lo que es esencialmente Indispensable al Novicio) [371-377], Mawaqui (Descenso de los Astros y Ascensiones de los Místicos) [378-432], Anwar (Tratado de las Luces, o sea, de los Misterios con que favorece Dios al que entra en la Soledad) [433-449], and Fotuhat (Las Revelaciones de Meca acerca del Conocimiento de Dios y del Mundo) [450-518]. Asín's brief biography describes Ibn 'Arabi's youthful 'conversion' to an inward path and first teachers,When about fifteen years old, after his acknowledgement of his young wife's virtues, as well as his suffering through a severe illness, Ibn 'Arabe received a calling and so changed his life. Before devoted to literature and hunting, afterwards he found and followed spiritual teachers. Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990) at 36-37, et seq.Shortly after finishing El Islam Asín translated Ibn 'Arabi's Ruh al- Quds, his tribute to his early teachers of al-Andaluz. Vidas de santones andaluces, la \\"Epistola de la santidad\\" de Ibn 'Arabi de Murcia (Madrid 1933). See Asín's bibliography below. his adolescent meeting with Averroës,The elder Averroes as the logical philosopher was pleased to meet Ibn 'Arabi, a respected young student of the intuitive, wise beyond his years. Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990) at 39-40. three of his visionary encounters with the 'maestro de verde' [green master] Jádir,Here Asín each time provides lengthy quotations from the Fotuhat which give Ibn 'Arabi's retelling of these events. Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990) at 49-50, 62-63, 72-73. and his travels visiting various sufis in al-Maghreb (e.g., Fes, and Túnez).Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990), at 60-76 (Fez, Túnez). In 1201 Ibn 'Arabi traveled further east across North Africa in pursuit of his spiritual journey, to Meca, Bagdad, Mosul, Cairo, Conia, Medina, Jerusalén, Alepo, and Damasco, where he died and where his tomb now draws pilgrims.Ibn 'Arabi's travels east in Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990), e.g., at 77-100 (Meca), at 101-117 (Damasco) and at 118 & 120 (photographs of his resting place there). Ibn 'Arabi was prolific teacher, leaving us a vast corpus of written works.Asín in his El Islam (1931, 1990) at 123 n.5, mentions the 150 items of Ibn 'Arabi listed by Carl Brockelmann in his Geschichte der arabisches Literatur, 5 volumes (Weimer & Leiden 1898-1942) at I: 442-448.The immense multi-volume al-Futuhat al-makkiyya is the major work by Ibn 'Arabi. Selections are translated as The Meccan Revelations, 2 volumes (New York: Pir Press 2002 & 2004), edited by Michel Chodkiewicz [first published in French and English as Les Illuminations de La Mecque (Paris: Sinbad 1998)]; Rev. Miguel Asín had translated a few selections of the Fotuhat in his El Islam (1931, 1990) at 450-518. Another major work by the Ibn 'Arabi is the shorter Fusus al-hikam, translated by R. W. J. Austin as The Bezels of Wisdom (Paulist Press 1980), Preface by Titus Burckhardt. Twenty-seven prophets are here individually addressed. Asín functioned as a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly with respect to the difficult and demanding Ibn 'Arabi, the Shaykh al-Akbar.Up to 1911, only one of the 150 extant works of Ibn 'Arabi had appeared in a European edition: a \\"brief glossary of Sufi technical terms\\" published by Gustav Flügel in 1845. Reynold A. Nicholson, \\"The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq\\" 1-9, at 1, in Muhyi'ddín Ibn Al-'Arabí, The Tarjumán Al-Ashwáq. A Collection of Mystical Odes (London: The Royal Asiatic Society 1911; reprint Nabu 2010).Cf., Claude Addas, Ibn 'Arabi ou La quéte du Soufre Rouge (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by Peter Kingsley as Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 1, and generally 1-10, in which Asín the pioneer undergoes a critique. Yet unfortunately the Addas biography at 40, note 24, apparently mistakens Asín's text at 37, notes 1 & 2, which does cite and quote to the Fotuhat [III:311 & I:363] regarding Ibn 'Arabi's young wife; cf., Austin's \\"Introduction\\" 17-59, at 46 n.3 and 22-23, to Ibn 'Arabi, Sufis of Andalucia (1971; 2002).Shaykh al-Akbar or greatest Teacher. Not surprisingly Asín assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystics and doctrines. Consequently, Asín brings his specific, spiritually-informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi.Asín, El Islam (1931, 1990), for example, at 5-7 (explaining his title), and at 7-28 (adumbrating his 'hypothesis'). According to Prof. Alexander Knysh, Asín was one of the earlier western scholars of Ibn 'Arabi, a motivated European clergyman who was: > \\"concerned with detecting the underlying affinities between Christian and > Islamic theology with a view to advancing an Islamo-Christian dialogue. Such > Christian scholars treated Ibn 'Arabi, if not exactly as a crypto-Christian, > then at least as a freethinker open to other religious confessions, > especially Christianity. However, a scrutiny of Ibn 'Arabi's attitude toward > other confessions, reveals little direct indebtedness to, or sympathy for, > Christian doctrines.\\"Alexander D. Knysh, Ibn 'Arabi in the Later Islamic > Tradition. The making of a polemical image in medieval Islam (Albany: State > Univ. of New York 1999) at 19 (& 283-284 [note 5]). Asín Palacios begins his second part by discussing the Sufi spiritual journey, its methods and discipline, and its various supporting societies. Here, Asín describes the distinct approaches found or developed by Ibn 'Arabi.From time to time Asín compares the Sufi practice of Ibn 'Arabi and the Christian. Asín, El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990), e.g., at 138-139 re St. Anthony the Great (251-356), 141-142 re St. John Chrysostom (347-407), 145-147 re Christian monasticism, 153-155 re St. Basil the Great (329-379), 158 re St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), 159-160 re St. Augustine (354-430), 169-171 re St. Ephraem the Syrian (c. 306-373), 174 re St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), 183 re St. Pachomius (292-348), 185 re St. John Cassian (c. 360-433), 187 re St. Paul (c. 5 BC-c. 67 AD), 191 re the Monks of Egypt, 195 re repetition of prayer [cf. John Main (1926-1982)], 202 re borrowing of the word charism (Arabic: carama[t]), 212-215 re St. Athanasius (297-373), 225 re St. John of the Cross (1542-1591), 231 re Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th-early 6th), 234 re 16th-century Spanish mystics, 246-247 re Richard of Saint Victor (died 1173), 248-249 re Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215), 257-258 re Jesus Christ, 260 re Greek lexicon, and 264-274 re Christian spirituality. For example, Asín mentions the purgative preparation required by Ibn 'Arabi regarding the four deaths, i.e., white, death to hunger; red, dying to passion; black, to endure suffering; green, to enter poverty.Asín, El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990) at 163, citing Ibn 'Arabi's work Amr at §109 (p.339), selections of which Asín translated (at 300-351) as Amr. La regla taxativa que fija las condiciones que deben cumplir los que siguen el camino de Dios [Restictive measures setting conditions to be fulfilled by those on the way of God]. While some see adjacent virtues clearly when young, and others take first a hard path of trials and of sorrows ... eventually to meet a challenging paradox and become humbled in the wilderness;Cf., El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990) at 254-255, which cites Ibn 'Arabi's Mawaqui [Mawaqi' al-nujum] at §193 (pp.390-392). Asín translated it in part (at 378-432) as Mawaqui. Descenso de los Astros y Ascensiones de los Místicos. Asín comments: \\"Para Abenarabi, ... la tristeza espiritual es la llave de las gracias de oración y contemplación, sin la cual el alma cae en la vanidad e ilusión de espíritu.\\" [Suffering is key to the graces, else the soul becomes vain by spiritual illusions]. El Islam cristianizado, at 254-255. yet each soul may mercifully receive a spiritual transformation, to become ultimately possessed by divine love in a felicitous vision of unity.The ultimate abode [Arabic: macam; Spanish: morada] on the mystic path is \\"love\\" [Arabic: mahaba; Spanish: amor]. Cf., Asín, El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990), at 199-200. Later he comments: \\"Todos los caminos, hasta aquí recorridos por el alma, tanto los de la vida ascética como los de la vida mística, deben conducir a este fin último: la unión con Dios por el amor. Abenarabi desenvuelve este tema, con difusión desacostumbrada, en su Fotuhat. (All roads, here running across the soul, as much for the ascetic as for the mystic, will lead to this ultimate end: the union with God through love. Ibn Arabi discloses this theme, with diffuse juxtapositions, in his Futuhat.) Asín, El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990), Capítulo XIII, \\"El Amor de Dios\\", at 240-251, 240.A characteristic doctrine widely attributed to Ibn 'Arabi is wahdat al-wujud [\\"unity of being\\"]. \\"Ibn al-'Arabi is known as the founder of the school of the Oneness of Being (wahdat al-wujud). Though he does not employ the term, the idea permeats his works.\\" William Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge. Ibn al-'Arabi's Metaphysics of Imagination (SUNY 1989), at 79 and 226. Wm. Chittick, Imaginal Worlds. Ibn al-'Arabi and the Problem of Religious Diversity (SUNY 1994), Chapter 1, \\"Oneness of Being\\" at 15-29. Ibn 'Arabi has described several varieties of sacred experience, including one in which, having known an awareness of unity with the Divine, a soul may return to the former daily life, yet nonetheless remaining aware also of the fruit of mystical events, conscious both of the \\"I and the not I\\", the commonplace and the transcendent.Asín, El Islam cristianizado (1931, 1990) at 255. Asín later refers us to the Christian experience mentioned by St. Paul of \\"Christ living within us\\". Ibid. at 257. Asín's discussion mentions different levels and approaches, and the virtues practiced. Here Asín apparently \\"avoided any analysis of Ibn 'Arabi's metaphysics.\\"Masataka Takeshita, Ibn 'Arabi's theory of the Perfect Man and its place in the history of Islamic thought. (Tokyo: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa 1987) at 2. In his introduction, Asín observes that while Christian Spain later became deeply influenced by Muslim mysticism, previously the oriental Church had equally influenced early Islam.Miguel Asín Palacios, El Islam cristianizado (Madrid: Editorial Plutarco 1931; reprint Ediciones Hiperión 1990), for example, at 12-13. Also, Asín Palacios, \\"Influencias evangélicas en la Literatura religiosa del Islam\\" at 8-27, in A volume of oriental studies dedicated to Edward G. Browne (Cambridge Univ. 1922), edited by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson.The same year Margaret Smith described this Christian influence on early Islam in some detail in her Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at chapters VI, VII, and XI. (This book also said to be reissued in 1976 as The Way of the Mystics, reprint Oxford Univ. 1978). Islam then arrived in the far west, the Maghreb al-Aksa and Andalusia, where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of religious studies, it might be said that Asín Palacios here presents us with a multidimensional, polyphonic text for comparative religion. In his other works on Sufi practice, Asín mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in al-Andalus (i.e., the school of Ibn Masarra), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (for example, the tariqah of the Sadilies [or xadilíes]).El Islam cristianizado at 171-174; cf. \\"Selected Publications\\" below (for example, Abenmasarra y su escuela, and Sadilies y alumbrados). Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 132-133. Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 180-181, 193-194. Asín refers to the many parallels between al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi,El Islam cristianizado, at 263 note 1, itemizing several with reference to the Fotuhat, and noting that Ibn 'Arabi gave public courses at Mecca on the Ilya of al-Ghazali. both well-known and still studied teachers. =Varia= Blaise Pascal Among the many articles of Asín Palacios are studies concerning the following subjects:Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios at 114-116 (Lull), 116-118 (Pascal), 125-126 (Ibn al-'Arif), 137-145 (Juan de la Cruz, Ibn 'Abbad of Ronda, Teresa of Avila, Sadilies and Alumbrados). Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 190-191, 193-194.See bibliography. *Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) and his notion of placing a wager concerning the chances of reward or punishment after death, with respect to similar ideas in Al-Ghazali; *Alumbrados, dissident religious groups organized in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, similarities compared with the Sadili school (tariqah). Ramon Lull *Ramon Lull (1233–1315), mystic who sought to convert Islam to Christianity, whose ideas Asín discussed in his book on Ibn Masarra, and also with respect to Ibn 'Arabi; *Ibn al-Arif (12th century) de Almería, influenced by Ibn Masarra, mentioned by Ibn 'Arabi; arif meaning \\"contemplation\\", although his practice was associated with quietist tendencies; *Ibn Bajjah (1106–1138) of Zaragoza, known in Latin as Avempace, particularly with regard to Aristotle's impact on European and Arab philosophy. Although Asín carefully followed the leads he found, nonetheless he continually seemed to remain grounded to his core area of research: the mutual influence of the distinctive civilizations of Islam and of Christianity during the centuries of Muslim rule in Spain, and thereafter, and the multilateral implications.Cf. Luce López-Baralt, her \\"Estudio introductorio\\" to Asín's Sadilies y Alumbrados (1990), regarding St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, as well as the Sadilies (a major Sufi tariqah located mainly in Northern Africa) and the Alumbrados; and her Islam in Spanish Literature (1985, 1992) on the two saints (chapters III and IV); and as well her San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam (1985, 1990); and her \\"Saint John of the Cross and Ibn 'Arabi\\" (2000). Here is the transliteration of Asín's name to reflect its Arabic pronunciation: Asīn Balāthīus.Cf., Arabic translation by Badawī of Asín's major work on Ibn 'Arabī (Cairo 1965). =Al- Ghazali= Autobiography of Al-Ghazali: the last page.Manuscript: Istanbul, Shehid Ali Pasha 1712. Text: Deliverance From Error (al-munqidh min al-ḍalāl). In the 1930s, Asín began yet another study of Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), which is entitled, La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano.Madrid-Granados: Escuelas de Estudios Arabes, 1934-1941. Nine of his prior works on al-Ghazali are cited therein by Asín (at I: 20-21). Work on these volumes was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.Asín's writings on Algazal are addressed by Valdivia Válor in Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 97-102, 116-118, 120-123, and La espiritualidad de Algazal at 123-125, 147-150. Asín expressly declared that the work was limited to a Christian interpretation of the celebrated Muslim and his work.Asín states that he purposely omits discussion of al-Ghazali's Muslim sources because already adequately covered by other scholars, e.g., Goldziher, MacDonald, Massignon, and Nicholson. Asín Palacios, La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano (Madrid-Granados 1934-1941): Prologue at 9-10.Monroe in his Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (1970) at 191-192, 194-195, probes this approach by Asín, and then censures what it may infer. Monroe cites to a blanket critique of orientalists (\\"dry and sterile\\") made by [Seyyed] Hossein Nasr, Three Muslim Sages (Harvard University 1964) at 156,n1 (to text at 83). His investigation focuses on themes of spiritual practice from the forty volume magnum opus of al-Ghazali, the Ihya 'Ulum ad-Din [Revival of the Religious Sciences].Only a few volumes of al-Ghazali's Ihya have been translated into English, for example, The Book of Knowledge or Kitab al-'ulm by Nabih Amin Faris (Lahore: Asraf 1962); and Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife or Kitab dhikr al-mawt wa ma ba'dahu by Timothy J. Winter (Cambridge: Islamic Text Society 1989).There are several abridgements of al-Ghazzali's Ihya 'Ulum-ud-Din including an English translation (\\"not too literally but in substance\\" which omits dated material [Preface]) by [Al-Haj] Maulana Fazal-ul-Karim in four-volumes (c. 1971), reprinted in Lahore by Sh. Muhammad Ashraf (2000), and by Kazi Publications. British scholar A. J. Arberry in 1942 called Asín's multivolume study \\"by far the most important monograph on Ghazali so far written,\\" but adversely noted the importation of foreign religious sentiments into Asín's work on the Muslim theologian.A. J. Arberry, An Introduction to the History of Sufism (Oxford 1942) at 53; cited by Monroe at 192. Yet Asín, noting the multiple interpenetration of the two rival faiths, felt justified in his course.Cf. Valdivia Válor (1992) at 161. Asín saw Islam as manifesting some similarity to a Christian heresy in its doctrines, given its espoused heritage, for example, referring to Ramadan and Lent [Prologue at 15-16].Asín repeatedly commented on the centuries of mutual influence between the two religions, hence his perceived bona fides in taking a Christian approach to al-Ghazali. González Palencia, \\"Necrologia: Don Miguel Asín\\" in Arbor II: 179-206 (1944), e.g., at 193-194, 198; cited by Valdivia Válor (1992) at 162-164.In this regard, Asín in his Prologue (La espiritualidad de Algazal at I: 18-19) refers to the Syrian Christian theologian Bar 'Ebraya (1226-1286), his Book of the Dove, in the annotated translation by Wensinck (1919). Another Syrian Christian theologian, Joannis Damascenus (676-749), in his Concerning Heresies discusses the \\"Heresy of the Ishmailites\\" at chapter 100 (attribution questioned), Muslims being called after Ishmael [Ismail] son of Abraham [Ibrahim].Interfaith dialogue will always have its troubles. \\"In the dialogue with Islam, Catholics have not always avoided, in an attempt to find shared beliefs and common ground, the danger of 'catholicizing' Muslim concepts and terminology and reading into them a Catholic sense they cannot possess.\\" Cardinal Francis George, The Difference God Makes. A Catholic Vision of Faith, Communion, and Culture (New York: Crossroad 2009), quoted by Robert P. Imbelli, \\"Identity Crisis?\\" in America, v.201 #12 at 36 (Nov.2, 2009). After addressing Al-Ghazali the person, including a short biography, Asín analyses the teachings of his Ihya in four parts: *first, his purgative ascetics, for example, how to overcome sensuality, idle talk, anger and hatred, envy, worldliness, greed, glory, hypocrisy, pride, vanity, and spiritual illusion (in volume I); *second, his path to unity, for example, penance, patience, gratitude, hope and fear, voluntary poverty, renunciation of the world, trusting in God, and love of God (vol. II); *third, his way to perfection, for example, the life plan, purity and sincerity, conscience, meditation, and the religious song (vol. III); *fourth, al-Ghazali's mystical doctrine, to which Asín also provides a Christian interpretation (also in vol. III).Discussion of the mystical is in Asín's third volume, at chapters 30 [211-268] and 31 [269-289]. In Asín's concluding volume IV, he translates selections from works by Al-Ghazali (21 titles other than the Ihya) and provides a brief analysis of each.Included are selections from his well-known Tahafut al-falasifa, or The Incoherence of the Philosophers. =John of the Cross= St. John of the Cross, Doctor of the Church. In 1933 Asín published in the first issue of the journal Al-Andalus an article about San Juan de la Cruz (1542–1591) and a doctrine he shared with spiritual Islam.\\"Un precursor hispano musulman de San Juan de la Cruz\\", which was later reprinted in Huellas del Islam (1941), at 235-304. An English translation was made by Douglas and Yoder as Saint John of the Cross and Islam (New York: Vantage 1981). This work can be seen to be equally about the saint's suggested forerunner, a Muslim mystic from Ronda, Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (1332–1389); and also about Ibn Abbad's own sources in the Sadili school (tariqah).Over half of Asin's article is selected translations of a text by followers of the tariqah's founder, Abu'l-Hasan ash-Shadhili (1196-1258), i.e., the Maxims [Kitab al-Hikam] of Ibn 'Ata Allah of Alexandria (died 1258), with a commentary thereon by Ibn Abbad of Ronda. The shared doctrine concerns the soul on the path toward union with the Divine. God, being unreachably transcendent, the soul's only approach is to renounce everything but God.Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios (1992) at 137-139, 138, citing Asín, Huellas del Islam (1933) at 249 [Saint John of the Cross and Islam (1981) at section II, pages 12-13]. Thereby the soul enters a desolation in which he (or she) lives only for God, yet the desolation may become too severe, causing the soul to despair, so that the merciful Deity grants him (or her) inspiration, followed by a phase of elation; afterwards the soul returns to the way through desolation in order to move closer to God. The doctrine shared teaches that the soul passing through these alternating states of \\"night\\" (contraction, due to despair) and \\"day\\" (inspired expansion) may relinquish the charismata of God's inspiring favors, i.e., the \\"day\\", so as to pass more quickly beyond the difficult rhythm of \\"night\\" and \\"day\\". Thereafter the soul finds repose, wherein to enter the transforming union.Asín Palacios, Saint John of the Cross and Islam (1933; 1981) at section II, 11-13. Asín analyses the technical vocabulary used by the sadilis and by San Juan de la Cruz in order to further establish the connection.Asín, Saint John of the Cross and Islam (1933; 1981) at 24-27 [in section III]. For further research which develops the work of Miguel Asín Palacios here, see Luce López-Baralt's book, San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam (1985, 1990). While not disputing these similarities as discussed by Asín, a subsequent scholar, José Nieto, remained critical of any implied linkage between the earlier teachings of the Sadili sufis and San Juan de la Cruz. To the contrary, the suggestion is that this 'shared mystical doctrine' functions at such a level of generality that it will arise spontaneously.José C. Nieto, Mystic Rebel Saint. A study of Saint John of the Cross (Geneva: Droz 1979) at 25-27.Cf., Swietlicki, Spanish Christian Cabala (1986) at 184. =Teresa of Ávila= St. Theresa of Ávila, Doctor of the Church, by Peter Paul Rubens. In a posthumously published article, Asín discusses Santa Teresa de Ávila (1515–1582).In Al Andalus XI:263-274 (1946), later reprinted in a collection of Asín's related articles (introduced by López-Baralt), Sadilies y Alumbrados (1989) at 179-190. Asín had left it untitled (López-Baralt, ibid., at xviii); now called: \\"El símil de los castillos y moradas del alma en la mística Islamica y en Santa Teresa\\" [\\"The figure of castles and dwellings of the soul in Islamic mysticism and in Saint Teresa\\"]. The similes and analogies she employed to communicate the experiences of her spiritual lifeSpecifically in Teresa's book Las Moradas o Castillo interior (1577), [The Dwellings or interior Castle], translated as Interior Castle by Kavanaugh in Saint Teresa of Avila (Paulist Press 1979); and by Peers (Sheed & Ward 1943; reprint Doubleday [Image Books] 1961). are discovered by Asín to parallel those previously employed by mystics of Islam. In this instance the image used is of seven dwelling places or castles, one inside the other.López-Baralt, Huellas del Islam en la literatura española (Madrid: Hiperión 1985), translated as Islam in Spanish Literature (Leiden: Brill 1992), at 107-113 (commenting on Asín's article). For St. Teresa's image of the soul as seven concentric castles: López-Baralt, Ibid., at 93.St. Teresa of Ávila, Interior Castle (1577; Image 1961) at 11-13 [Peers' Introduction], and at 28, 29, 37, etc. [Santa Teresa's text]; also cf., E. Allison Peers, Studies of the Spanish Mystics (London 1927-1930), at I: 162-191.Santa Teresa previously used like imagery in her Camino de perfección of 1566, at chapter 67 (cited in Asín's posthumous article at 185). Asín mentions the TanwirKitab al-tanwir fi isqat al-taqdir, cited by Asín (1946, 1989) at 179, 180, 183, 186; as well as his Miftah, at 183n1. of the sadili Ibn 'Ata Allah; the TayridKitab al-tayrid, or Libro de la desnudez espiritual [Book of spiritual nakedness], Asín (1946, 1989) at 181, 188. of Ahmad al-Gazali (brother of Algazel); and, the anonymous NawadirKitab nawadir, redacted in the 16th century from older material [183], cited by Asin (1946, 1989) at 183, 185, 186, 187, 190. compiled by Ahmad al-Qalyubi, with its seven concentric castles.Asín (1946, 1989) at 183, 186; parallel in number and array. Asín draws out other mutualities in the matrix of symbols, for example, the Divinity being in the central dwelling.At 182, 184, 186 in Asín (1946, 1989). Among other coincidences: the demonic dog lurking outside, trying to enter [181, 183, 186]. Luce López-Baralt further explores this association of images, tracing the parallel to a 9th-century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, Abu- l-Hasan al-Nuri (died 907), whose Maqamat al-qulub [Stations of the Heart] describes seven castles, one inside the other, through which the soul travels toward God.Luce López-Baralt, Huellas del Islam en la literatura española (Madrid: Hiperión 1985), translated as Islam in Spanish Literature (Leiden : E.J.Brill 1992) at 110; for Santa Teresa generally, Chapter Four, 191-142. López-Baralt later translated al-Nuri into Spanish (Madrid 1999). Also: López- Baralt, The Sufi Trobar Clus and Spanish Mysticism (Lahore 2000, as translated by Huxley) re St. Teresa and al-Nuri at 75-85, while she refers to Asín's work at 79-82, 85-87. After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image,López-Baralt, Islam in Spanish Literature (1985, 1992) at 91-92 text, and at note 2. López-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably from a popular allusion that lay dormant within her for years, resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences.López-Baralt, Islam in Spanish Literature at 91, note 2; she discounts a possible \\"Jungian\\" dimension to the symbolic similarities. Following other similar studies,For example, Francisco Marquez Villanueva, \\"El símil del Castillo interior: sentido y génesis\\" in Acta del Congreso Internacional Teresiano (Univ. Pontifica de Salamanca 1983); and, J. A. Carpenter and Come Carpenter, \\"La experiencia y la escatología mística de Santa Teresa y sus paralelos en el Islam medieval de los sufis\\" at 159-187 in Actas del I Congreso Internacional sobre Santa Teresa y la Mística Hispanica edited by Manuel Criado de Val (Madrid 1984). Catherine Swietlicki took a new but related direction, discussing Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage,Santa Teresa's father, Don Alonso Sanchez de Cepeda, was pius and learned; his father (her grandfather) was a \\"New Christian\\" or Jewish converso. Cf., Swietlicki, Spanish Christian Cabala (1986) at 49-51. and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths.Catherine Swietlicki, Spanish Christian Cabala. The Works of Luis de Leon, Santa Teresa de Jesus, and San Juan de la Cruz (University of Missouri 1986), i.e., St. Teresa and the Christian Kabbalah generally at 51-81, re Sufis and the seven castles at 62-66. Swietlicki here is cited by López-Baralt, Islam in Spanish Literature (1985, 1992) at 127-131, 134. The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de Ávila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of convivencia in medieval Spain.\\"Convivencia\\" signifies \\"living together\\" in Spanish, and may refer to an early medieval Golden Age ideal, in which the three faiths would share their cultures in peace. Prof. Asín contributed to the reification of the third pillar.The 16th century when Saint Teresa lived, however, was a period of prolonged conflict and discord. For the Convivencia epoch, e.g., Mann, Glick, Dodds, editors, Convivencia. Jews, Muslims, and Christians in Medieval Spain (New York: George Braziller, & The Jewish Museum 1992); Burns, editor, Emperor of Culture. Alfonso X the Learned of Castile and His Thirteenth Century Renaissance (University of Pennsylvania 1990); Américo Castro, The Spaniards. An Introduction to Their History (University of California 1971); Richard Fletcher, Moorish Spain (New York: Henry Holt 1992). Perspectives The works of Asín Palacios are widely admired, notwithstanding criticism that his view point was of a Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, it can be said that the Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the Nostra aetate document of Vatican II (1962–1965).Valdivia Válor, Don Miguel Asín Palacios.

It stars Christopher Lee as the eponymous villain, a Chinese criminal mastermind, and Nigel Green as his pursuing rival Nayland Smith, a Scotland Yard detective. The film was a British-West German co-production, and was the first in a five-part series starring Lee and produced by Harry Alan Towers for Constantin Film, the second of which was The Brides of Fu Manchu released the next year, with the final entry being The Castle of Fu Manchu in 1969. Only the first two were directed by Sharp. It was shot in Technicolor and Techniscope on location in County Dublin, Ireland. Plot The beheading of international criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu is witnessed in China by his nemesis Nayland Smith. Back in England, however, it is increasingly apparent to Smith that Dr. Fu Manchu is still operating. Despite the skepticism by his close friend Dr. Petrie, Smith is quick to detect that the execution he witnessed was that of a double, an actor hypnotized into taking Dr. Fu Manchu's place. The villain is back in London, and has kidnapped the esteemed Professor Muller, whose research holds the key to a potentially deadly solution from the seeds of a rare Tibetan flower: the Blackhill poppy. The seed of this poppy is sometimes referred to as \\"The Seed of Life\\", and Tibetans spoke legends of it being the secret to eternal life. Although the poppy seed's poison loses its toxicity when exposed to heat, Fu Manchu has heard Tibetan legends that the poison was once weaponized. A pint of this poison is powerful enough to kill every person and animal in London. Nayland Smith correctly deduces that Professor Muller had received his supply of Blackhill poppy seeds from illegal drug trade. After Fu Manchu cut off the drug trade, the poppy seeds were mainly acquired from Hanuman - a warehouse owner who is secretly in cahoots with Fu Manchu. Nayland Smith meets Hanuman in his warehouse to question him on the whereabouts of Professor Muller. In Hanuman's office, Hanuman pulls a gun on Smith, who is able to knock him out before he can fire. Nayland Smith quickly leaves the building and deliberately avoids giving his attention to Hanuman's secretary, whom he recognizes as Lin Tang - Fu Manchu's daughter and partner-in-crime. Lin Tang recognized Nayland Smith when he entered the building, and she phoned Hanuman to kill Nayland Smith before their meeting in the office. Hanuman regains consciousness, then he and Lin Tang go underground to a secret base under the River Thames. There, Lin Tang informs her father that his nemesis Nayland Smith has gotten involved in their plans. Lin Tang informs Fu Manchu that their prisoner Professor Muller has refused to divulge how to extract the poisonous essence from the Blackhill poppy seeds. To coerce Professor Muller, Fu Manchu has his henchmen kidnap the professor's daughter Maria. After both prisoners are forced to watch one of Fu Manchu's henchwoman drown (as the henchwoman's punishment for trying to free Professor Muller), Professor Muller then reveals that documents detailing the properties of the Blackhill poppy were given to Professor Gaskel by the Grand Lama. The documents were given during the Younghusband expedition that Professor Muller resents not being a part of. The documents are currently locked in a vault that only Professor Gaskel has access to. The vault is in a guarded room of the Museum of Oriental Studies. Fu Manchu's daughter Lin Tang dons a disguise and infiltrates the museum. She drops a listening device. Meanwhile, Fu Manchu's henchmen break into the museum's guarded room by entering through the sewer tunnels. However, Nayland Smith and his allies kill the henchmen only to discover that the vault had been emptied by Professor Gaskel earlier ago. This information is heard through the listening device of Lin Tang, whom Nayland Smith and company recognize. Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie engage in a car chase after Lin Tang and Fu Manchu, but the duo escapes. Professor Gaskel is in his study when Lin Tang and Fu Manchu emerge. Fu Manchu hypnotizes Professor Gaskel to be under his control. They go to Fu Manchu's underground lair, where Professor Gaskel works on distilling the poisonous essense of the Blackhill poppy with Professor Muller. As they work, Fu Manchu is informed that the Essex village of Fleetwick is currently under freezing temperatures, so the poppy seed's poisonous properties will persist if used there. He makes an announcement on the radio to let the entire country know of his return, and to obey him. As a show of his power, he announces that he will target Fleetwick [sic]. Nayland Smith has British soldiers sent to protect Fleetwick. Fu Manchu has a plane fly over Fleetwick. From the plane, the Blackhill poppy poison is sprayed onto the almost 3000 civilians and soldiers below, killing them within seconds. By this point, Professor Gaskel has also been hypnotized into committing suicide. Nayland Smith and his associates use some maps and detective work to deduce the entrances and location of Fu Manchu's hideout. With the intent of flooding the hideout, they break in through the hidden entrance in Hanuman's warehouse. They confront Fu Manchu and his minions, and a brawl ensues. After the lights go out, Fu Manchu and his minions escape to a Tibetan monastery with Professor Muller while the River Thames hideout is flooded. Nayland Smith and his team leave the underground hideout via an exit that leads to a graveyard. Deducing that Blackhill poppy seeds only grow in Tibet, Nayland Smith and company go to there and find Fu Manchu. He is at a Tibetan monastery receiving Blackhill poppy seeds from the Grand Lama. Nayland Smith and company find Professor Muller, who informs them that Fu Manchu already has all the knowledge and poppy seeds he needs to bring the world to its knees. Nayland Smith reassures Nayland Smith by revealing that he has a detonator hidden underneath the poppy seeds in one of Fu Manchu's boxes, and it is rigged to explode. Nayland Smith, Professor Muller, and their allies leave the monastery, much to Fu Manchu's frustration. Fu Manchu ponders why Nayland Smith did not take the poppy seeds. A few seconds later, Smith's detonator blows up and the monastery grounds burst in an enormous ball of flame. Nayland Smith is riding horseback with his allies and sees the explosion from afar. The film ends with a medium closeup of Fu Manchu fading in over the explosion, and his voice uttering, \\"The world shall hear from me again... the world shall hear from me again\\".

It has all the ingredients of Sherlock Holmes plus a touch of the Kaiser's Yellow Peril. I bet more people have heard of Fu Manchu that Mao Tse-Tung. And anyway these days you couldn't have a better nationality for a villain.\\" He said his intention from the beginning was to make \\"four of five of these\\" but denied the films were made to cash in on the James Bond craze: > No relationship. Action, adventure, open-air, escapism – yes – but nothing > to do with Bond-ism – Fu Manchu's atmosphere is a kind of timeless Never > Never land. Bond is gimmicky and with-it. Towers decided to make it a period film (it is set in 1912) because it \\"adds to the plausibility\\". The film was shot on location in the Republic of Ireland, with Towers commenting: > It's a good country for location work; the British quota helps; on costs, > there is not much difference between making a film here and in Britain – > both sets of unions see to that. Ardmore? It seems to be doing alright with > the present film – and Ireland will always be attractive as long as > filmmakers and their artists are seeking refuge from super tax. The prison sequences were shot at Kilmainham Gaol. Director Don Sharp said \\"you never know what his [Fu Manchu's] motives are. I mean, he may want to rule the world, blow it up, corner the gold or seduce all the women. The script doesn't say. So we just keep everything moving fast so the audience doesn't have time to think 'but that's impossible' until they get outside.\\" \\"There's not much sex in the books,\\" said Towers, \\"but we've remedied that. We've got damsels in distress, a woman kidnapped, slave girls whipped. It's very kinky.\\" Soundtrack The British version of the film was scored by Christopher Whelen, while the German release version was scored by Gert Wilden. A tie-in song, \\"Don't Fool with Fu Manchu\\" performed by The Rockin' Ramrods,The Face of Fu Manchu Pressbook was not heard in the film. Release In order to promote the film in the U.S., \\"Fu Manchu for Mayor\\" posters were done up and distributed in New York City during a mayoral election. The New York Times did not like the film, saying: > The Face of Fu Manchu, back again after all these years, is about as > frightening as Whistler's Mother. If this slow, plodding, simple-minded > little color melodrama were not so excruciating, it might have been > acceptable farce. Christopher Lee, as the old evil one, complete with waxy > mustache, looks and sounds like an overgrown Etonite. Fu Manchu, fooey. Nonetheless, the film was successful enough to result in four sequels. \\"The first one should have been the last one\\", Lee wrote in 1983, \\"because it was the only really good one.\\"  Sequels  * The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966) * The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967) * The Blood of Fu Manchu (1968) * The Castle of Fu Manchu (1969) References External links The Face of Fu Manchu at BFI Screenonline * Category:1965 films Category:1960s adventure thriller films Category:1960s crime thriller films Category:British adventure thriller films Category:British crime thriller films Category:British films Category:West German films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Don Sharp Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland Category:Films based on British novels Category:German crime thriller films ","title":"The Face of Fu Manchu"},{"id":"5644609","text":"Borat is a 2006 mockumentary comedy film directed by Larry Charles.

Born in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, McGarry first played competitive hurling whilst at school in Kilkenny CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Kilkenny junior team. He joined the senior team for the 1997 championship. McGarry went on to play a key part for Kilkenny for over a decade, and won five All-Ireland medals, seven Leinster medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner- up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, McGarry won three Railway Cup medals. At club level he enjoyed a lengthy but largely unsuccessful career with Bennettsbridge. Throughout his career McGarry made 35 championship appearances. His retirement came following Kilkenny's defeat of Waterford in the 2008 championship. In retirement from playing McGarry became involved in team management and coaching. He was joint-manager of the Ballyhale Shamrocks team that claimed county, Leinster and All-Ireland titles during the 2009-10 season. In September 2013 McGarry was appointed as a selector to the Kilkenny senior team. Playing career =Club= McGarry was born in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, and plays his club hurling with his local club in Bennettsbridge. Although best known as a goalkeeper, McGarry began his playing career as an outfield player. While Bennettsbridge were once regarded as one of the best clubs in the county championship their fortunes have taken a downturn in the last few decades. In spite of this McGarry has still had some success with the club, winning intermediate league county medals and county junior football medals. =Junior= Surprisingly McGarry never lined out at minor or under-21 levels for his native county. Instead he first came to prominence as a goalkeeper on the Kilkenny junior hurling team in the 1990s. He first tasted success in 1993 when he won a Leinster junior title following a win over Wexford. McGarry later lined out against Clare in the All-Ireland final, however, Kilkenny were completely outclassed on that occasion. A final score of 3-10 to 0-8 gave Clare the victory. In 1994 McGarry added a second Leinster junior title to his collection as Wexford fell again in the provincial decider. Once again Kilkenny later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Cork provided the opposition. After a close and exciting game it was Cork who stole the victory with a 2-13 to 2-11 score line. In 1995 McGarry collected a third consecutive Leinster medal. Once again Kilkenny subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final. It was their third consecutive championship decider in-a-row; however, defeat had been their lot in the previous two deciders. Clare were the opponents on this occasion, however, Kilkenny won 1-20 to 1-6, giving McGarry an All-Ireland junior medal. =Senior= McGarry subsequently joined the Kilkenny senior hurling panel in 1997 as sub goalkeeper to Joe Dermody. At the age of 26 it appeared that his chance at senior championship hurling may have passed by. All this changed in 1999 when he took over as the first-choice goalkeeper on the senior team under the new manager Brian Cody. That year he won his first senior Leinster title following a comprehensive victory over reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly. McGarry later lined out in his first All-Ireland final, with arch-rivals Cork providing the opposition. Although he kept a clean sheet, a Cork team, with an average age of 22, came back from four points down to win the game by a solitary point. In 2000, McGarry captured a second Leinster title as Kilkenny steamrolled Offaly once again in the provincial final. The ‘back-door system’ allowed the two sides to later meet again in the All-Ireland final. The game turned out to be a complete mismatch as the Kilkenny forwards went on a goal-scoring spree. It was one of the most one-sided All-Ireland finals in decades as ‘the Cats’ won by 5-15 to 1-14. This victory gave McGarry his first senior All-Ireland medal. In 2001 McGarry added a third successive Leinster medal to his collection as Kilkenny completely overpowered Wexford in the provincial final once again. After such a huge win ‘the Cats’ were hot favourites to retain their All- Ireland title; however, Kilkenny were outsmarted by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. ‘The Cats’ bounced back in 2002 with McGarry claiming a first National Hurling League medal. He subsequently claimed a fourth Leinster title before later lining out in a third All-Ireland final. Clare, who were defeated in the first-round of the Munster championship but had made it to the final via the newly introduced qualifier system, put up a good fight, however, McGarry claimed another clean sheet in a championship decider. A combined tally of 2-13 for Henry Shefflin and D.J. Carey gave Kilkenny a seven-point victory and gave McGarry a second All-Ireland medal. In 2003, McGarry captured a fifth consecutive Leinster medal after another huge win. The subsequent All- Ireland final saw ‘the Cats’ take on arch-rivals Cork. It was a close and tense affair as the Leinster men never led by more than four points. Kilkenny only secured victory with a late Martin Comerford goal and won the day with a 1-14 to 1-11 score line. It was McGarry’s third All-Ireland medal in four years. In 2004, Kilkenny were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, the team was now under severe pressure from all quarters. For the first time in seven years Kilkenny failed in their bid to become Leinster champions as a last-gasp Wexford goal ended a run of success in the provincial championship. Kilkenny took the scenic route via the qualifiers system; however, after a scare against Clare they still reached the All-Ireland final. Once again Cork provided the opposition on a gloomy and overcast day. The sides were level for much of the game; however, in the final twenty minutes Cork scored nine points without reply and secured the victory. Kilkenny ended the year with no silverware, however, McGarry kept a clean sheet in a third All-Ireland final. Kilkenny were back in form in 2005 with McGarry adding a second National League medal to his ever-growing collection. He later collected a sixth Leinster title as ‘the Cats’ had a narrow win over reigning provincial champions Wexford. While a third successive All-Ireland showdown with Cork seemed extremely likely, Galway defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the most exciting games of the decade. In 2006 McGarry captured a third National League medal. He later won a third Leinster title following another victory over Wexford before later lining out in his third All-Ireland final. The game that everyone had predicted would happen in 2005 was now taking place as Cork squared up to Kilkenny for the third time in four years. The Leesiders were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, revenge was foremost in the minds of Kilkenny as it was Cork who denied their three-in-a-row bid in 2004. On the day Kilkenny were far too strong for Cork with McGarry playing a key role on the goal-line. The score of 1-16 to 1-13 gave Kilkenny a 29th All-Ireland title and gave McGarry a fourth All-Ireland medal. For the seventh time in eight years McGarry was nominated for an All-Star award, however, once again he was overlooked. In 2007 McGarry was dropped as the first-choice goalkeeper on the Kilkenny senior team and was replaced by P.J. Ryan, his understudy of many years. In the All-Ireland semi- final against Wexford Ryan fractured his arm and for a while it looked like McGarry would make an emotional return to senior hurling after his wife’s death in a road traffic accident earlier in the year.http://www.hoganstand.com/Kilkenny/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=81567 In the end Ryan made a spectacular recovery and was fit to play. Kilkenny went on to defeat Limerick by 2-19 to 1-15 and McGarry and his son received a special mention from captain Henry Shefflin as he received the Liam MacCarthy Cup. While many expected McGarry to retire from inter-county hurling following this win he returned to the panel in 2008 as Kilkenny launched an all-out attack in an attempt to capture a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. He remained on the substitutes’ bench for the entire campaign until the All-Ireland final against Waterford. After fifty minutes the game was effectively over due to the huge score that Kilkenny had recorded. At that point goalkeeper P.J. Ryan was called to the sideline and McGarry went in as a substitute. He received a warm welcome from both the Kilkenny and the Waterford fans as they both realised the significance of the situation. Although the game was well beyond Waterford at that stage, McGarry did leave in an Eoin Kelly goal. In spite of this Kilkenny won the game by 3-30 to 1-13. It was McGarry’s sixth All-Ireland medal and his fifth on the field of play. Furthermore, the team made history by capturing their elusive three-in-a-row. He retired from inter-county hurling following this win. =Personal life= McGarry currently lives in Thomastown with his son Darragh (born 1996), who plays goalkeeper for Thomastown GAA. In 2007, shortly before the 2007 All Ireland Final his wife Vanessa was killed in a car crash outside Thomastown. McGarry and his son were honored at the final and Darragh helped Henry Shefflin hold up the Liam MacCarthy Cup. =Provincial= McGarry has also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and has enjoyed some success. He won his first Railway Cup medal in 2002 as Leinster defeated arch-rivals Munster. McGarry won a second Railway Cup title in 2003 when Leinster defeated a Connacht side made up entirely of Galway players. 2006 saw McGarry add a third and final Railway Cup medal to his collection. Coaching career In 2009 McGarry took up a coaching and joint-managerial role with the Kilkenny club Ballyhale Shamrocks. He has guided the club to a record-equalling four-in-a- row in the county championship. This was followed by the Shamrocks retaining the Leinster club title and regaining the All-Ireland title.

The Morgan Line was the line of demarcation set up after World War II in the region known as Julian March which prior to the war belonged to the Kingdom of Italy. The Morgan Line was the border between two military administrations in the region: the Yugoslav on the east, and that of the Allied Military Government on the west. After 15 September 1947, the Allied Military Government was composed of both the British Element Trieste Forces (BETFOR) troops from the United Kingdom and the Trieste United States Troops (TRUST) from the United States. Boundary The Morgan Line established a temporary boundary between the Yugoslav and Allied administrations in the region of Julian March (Venezia Giulia), contended by Italy and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and also to reduce the possibility of combat between Allied and Yugoslav forces in the area. The line was named after the British representative at the negotiations in Duino that resulted in the demarcation, Lieutenant General Sir William Duthie Morgan. Morgan, chief of staff to Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, had been sent to Belgrade on May 7 to remind Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito that Yugoslav forces were in violation of a February 1945 written agreement between Tito and Alexander in occupying the territory. During the negotiations, Morgan drew up a line, then called the \\"Blue Line\\" and, when Allied troops of the British XIII Corps began moving forward to the blue line on May 22, Tito agreed in principle to the demarcation the next day, with the agreement signed in Duino on June 10, 1945. Location Memorial plaque to the Morgan line in Spodnje Škofije, Slovenia. In Istria, the line served as the border between Zone A and Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste between 1947 and 1954. Today, almost all of the former Morgan Line lies within Slovenian territory. The line, approximately 70 miles in length, began on the coast just south of Trieste, curved 15 miles to the east and then northwest to Gorizia, Italy, then north along the Isonzo/Soča River through Kobarid to Rateče near the Italian-Austrian border. The demarcation divided the Julian March into two zones, \\"Zone A\\" under Allied military administration and \\"Zone B\\" under the administration of the Yugoslav People's Army. =Zone A= Zone A comprised the western portion of the region, which included the current Italian provinces of Trieste and Gorizia, a strip of territory between the current Slovene-Italian border and the Soča/ Isonzo river, the Brda/ Collio hills, the lower Vipava Valley/ Valle del Vipacco (corresponding roughly to the current Slovene municipalities of Šempeter-Vrtojba, Renče-Vogrsko, Miren-Kostanjevica and most of the municipality of Nova Gorica, except the Banjšice Plateau), the western section of the Karst Plateau (corresponding more or less to the current Slovene municipalities of Sežana and Komen), and the Istrian villages of Plavje, Spodnje Škofije, Elerji, and Hrvatini, now in Slovenia. The Istrian coastal town of Pula (now in Croatia) was also under Allied administration, forming an enclave of Zone A within the territory of Zone B. =Zone B= The Yugoslav- administered Zone B extended to almost two-thirds of the region, including the city of Rijeka/ Fiume, most of the Istrian peninsula (with the exception of the town of Pula/Pola and the municipalities of Muggia and Dolina), the Cres- Lošinj/ Cherso - Lussino archipelago, and the eastern portion of the Slovene Littoral. The village of Opatje Selo/ Oppachiesella on the northwestern edge of the Karst Plateau formed a small enclave of Zone B within the territory of Zone A. End of the line The Morgan Line ceased to exist on 15 September 1947, when the Treaty of Peace with Italy came into effect. The Treaty established the border between Italy and Yugoslavia in the northern sections of the contended territory, as well as the border between Yugoslavia and the Free Territory of Trieste established as new independent, sovereign State under a provisional regime of Government Article 21 and Annex VII, Instrument for the Provisional Regime of the Free Territory of Trieste. See: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2049/v49.pdf under the direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Councilsee: United Nations Security Council 16, 10 January 1947: http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/16(1947) in its southern part. Allied troops along the Morgan Line withdrew several miles to a parallel \\"French Line\\" (adopted at the recommendation of the French Foreign Minister), part of which ran along sections of the former Morgan Line. The Free Territory was divided into two administration zones (Zone A, under an Allied Military Government and Zone B under a Yugoslav Military Government), and the demarcation line between the two zones ran along the Morgan line.

Science College and Academy status Hounsdown gained Science College status in 2005, and the school changed its official title to 'Hounsdown School – A Science College'. With the new title came a new logo, new uniform and a £500,000 government grant to be spent on science equipment.

On 1 August 2011, Hounsdown School officially gained academy status. Ofsted The school's most recent Ofsted inspection judgement, in 2017, was Outstanding. Department for Education Investment In May 2013, Hounsdown School was successful in achieving approximately £1.3 million for essential Capital refurbishments/decorating works.School Newsletter Structure Pupils begin at the school in year seven, most having attended one of the three feeder primary schools: Abbotswood Junior School (majority), Bartley Junior School or Foxhills Junior School. Until KS3 SATs were abandoned nationally, pupils studied the Key Stage 3 syllabus until the SATs. In 2005, instead of taking SATs in year nine, the decision was taken that students would take them in year 8 to give students an extra year of GCSE help. They then pick a cycle of three subjects at the end of year 8 (e.g. drama, music, history) and a language to carry on into year nine. Students then try out these subjects and pick their final GCSE options at the end of year nine, which they could drop at any time during year 10. Many schools in Scotland and Wales use a more traditional system, which, in year nine, has pupils consolidating their learning from primary school and KS3. GCSE courses start for all subjects in year 10, with the examinations held during the summer term of year 11. Pupils can then enter employment, or continue their education at 6th Form College. Colleges which most students go onto from Hounsdown are Totton, and Brockenhurst. Key Stage Four Unlike most schools, pupils at Hounsdown start studying for their GCSE in year nine, rather than year 10. The pupils choose their GCSE options at the start of year nine, but they can be changed at the start of year 10 at the pupil's behest. Compulsory subjects including Science, Mathematics, English, ICT and Religious Education (also known as Applied Ethics) although this may be subject to change. Students were previously required to take one foreign language as well as a course from the Design and Technology category but these are no longer compulsory. Most students take their final GCSE exams in Year 11 but some students take them in Year 10 for particular subjects. Coursework, commonly associated with subjects such as Art and Design and Technology, is also accounted towards their final GCSE grades. Resource centre The Resources Centre provides a wide range of materials for pupils to use for their coursework in different subjects. The Resources Centre is involved with the Hampshire Book Award, and pupils regularly review new books for the school's library service. The library keeps audio tapes, CDs, and computers, the latter of which include word-processing programs. Photocopying and document-production is also available at the library. The Library has movie editing facilities and has a range of Technical Resources. Facilities/ Sport The school provides for hire a swimming pool (although this has been block booked by the Swim School Academy for the last couple of years and is no longer available for other clubs), two rugby pitches, two football pitches, their classrooms, the sports hall and the Library (Resources Centre). The Main hall provides a large and flexible staging area where concerts and productions are regularly performed, and is also equipped with lighting and PA theatre equipment. The School provides 6 ICT suites and in early 2013, the school applied for funding for an Apple Mac suite, now situated in the Art block. The Library (Resources Centre) was recently refurbished in 2009 and provides a vast array of books, as well as 50 Networked computers, and a number of Apple Macs. The school has 10 science laboratories, a sports hall and 3 Drama studios and a brand new dance studio, each fitted with multi-fixture lighting rigs and PA systems, also used for lower scale productions. In 2014, the East Block was completed of Re-cladding, a brand-new purpose built Dance Studio was built next to the Sports Hall and the Music areas were refurbished with the inclusion of a new recording studio for GCSE work and professional standard compositions.In 2005, The year 10 team reached the National Cup Semi-Finals losing to Bayhouse in Fareham, Matt Ritchie, who now plays for Newcastle scored 2 goals.

He was a member of CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) from 1939. Biography Stolyarsky was born in 1871 in Lypovets, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Ukraine). He first studied with his father, then with Stanisław Barcewicz in Warsaw, and subsequently with Emil Młynarski and Josef Karbulka in Odessa. In 1893 he graduated from Odessa music school. In 1893-1919 became a member of the Odessa Opera House orchestra. From 1898 commenced his pedagogical activity teaching children from the age of 4. In 1912 he opened his own music school. From 1919 he taught at the Odessa conservatory (where he became a professor in 1923). He founded the Odessa School of violin playing and became one of the founders of the Soviet violin school. With regard to violin teachers, through his teacher Emil Młynarski he is the \\"great-son\\" of Leopold Auer and the \\"great-great-son\\" of Joseph Joachim. Through his teacher Stanisław Barcewicz he is the \\"great-son\\" of Niccolo Paganini. His students won top prizes among important competitions. In the 1935 Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Warsaw two of his pupils won prizes: David Oistrakh and Boris Goldstein. (Official result; Ginette Neveu from France came first, David Oistrakh second, Henri Temianka won third, Boris Goldstein came in fourth and Josef Hassid from Poland received an honorary diploma.) In 1937, at one of the most prestigious international competitions of its time, the International Ysaye Competition, Stolyarsky students caused a sensation. Top prizes were garnered by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. \\"The results of the sessions created a profound impression: the Soviet school, with an assurance that bordered on arrogance, carried off all the prizes from the first down. The latter was awarded without the slightest discussion to the great David Oistrakh. Everyone else had to be content with crumbs; the Belgian violin school, though still a source of pride, failed, and its absence at the final was much commented on; Arthur Grumiaux and Carlo Van Neste, both young and inexperienced, were not able to convince the jury.\\" The Queen Elisabeth Competition In the Soviet Union Stolyarsky's name was always associated with the special pedagogic method for professional instruction(s) in music for gifted children (from an early age). Stolyarsky had superb personal qualities of a master teacher, highest musical instincts and organizational talent which made it possible for him to attain maximum results. Among his star pupils were David Oistrakh, Nathan Milstein, Iosif Brodsky, Samuil Furer, Boris Goldstein, Mikhail Goldstein, Daniel Shindarov, Elizabeth Gilels (wife of the Soviet violinist Leonid Kogan and sister to the eminent pianist Emil Gilels), Igor Oistrakh, Mikhail Fikhtengoltz and Eduard Grach who was one of his last pupils. Stolyarsky's name is also associated with the School of Stolyarsky, a special music school for gifted children in Odessa (which was opened in 1933 upon his initiative). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. Honours and awards * Order of the Red Banner of Labour * People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR He died in Sverdlovsk, USSR in 1944, aged 72.

As their name implies, some of the better known forms were generally hog-like, and the group has traditionally been placed within the Suina (pigs, peccaries and their ancestors), though some recent work suggests they may have been more closely related to camels.Spaulding, M., O'Leary, M.A. & Gatesy, J.

They were heavy-bodied, with short four-toed hooves and comparatively long tails. The animals would have looked rather pig- or sheep-like, but features of their teeth indicate they were more closely related to camelids. They were most likely woodland and grassland browsers, and were widespread in North America during the Oligocene and Miocene. Later forms diversified to suit a range of different habitats. For example, Promerycochoerus had adaptations suggesting a semiamphibious lifestyle, similar to that of modern hippos.  Taxonomy  Diplobunops skeleton The two families of oreodonts are the Merycoidodontidae (originally known as Oreodontidae) which contains all of the advanced species, and the Agriochoeridae, smaller, primitive oreodonts. Together they form the now-extinct suborder Oreodonta. Oreodonts may have been distantly related to pigs, hippopotamuses, and the pig-like peccaries. Indeed, some scholars place Merycoidodontidae within the pig-related suborder Suina (Suiformes). Other scholars place oreodonts closer to camels in the suborder Tylopoda. Still, other experts put the oreodonts together with the short-lived cainotheres in the taxonomic suborder Ancodonta comprising these two groups of extinct ancodonts. All scholars agree, however, that the oreodont was an early form of even-toed ungulate, belonging to the order Artiodactyla. Today, most evidence points towards the oreodonts being tylopods, along with camels, xiphodonts, and protoceratids. Over 50 genera of Oreodonta have been described in the paleozoological literature. However, oreodonts are widely considered to be taxonomically oversplit, and many of these genera may prove to be synonymous. The last researchers to fully review oreodont taxonomy, C. Bertrand Schultz and Charles H. Falkenbach, have been criticized for erecting excessive numbers of genera, based in part on apparent anatomical differences between different specimens that were actually taphonomic deformations due to postburial forces. Undeformed skulls would be placed in one genus, while skulls crushed from side to side would be placed in a second genus and skulls crushed from front to back would be placed in a third genus. Researchers are beginning to restudy oreodonts and synonymize many genera, but only a few groups have been reviewed.  Natural history  This diverse group of stocky prehistoric mammals grazed amid the grasslands, prairies, or savannas of North and Central America throughout much of the Cenozoic era. First appearing 48 million years ago (Mya) during the warm Eocene epoch of the Paleogene period, the oreodonts dominated the American landscape 34 to 23 Mya during the dry Oligocene epoch, but they mysteriously disappeared 4 Mya during the colder Pliocene epoch of the late Neogene period. Today, fossil jaws and teeth of the Oreodonta are commonly found amid the 'Oreodon beds' (White River Fauna) of the White River badlands in South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Many oreodont bones have also been reported at the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in Oregon. Some oreodonts have been found at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument. In Oligocene/Miocene Florida, oreodonts are surprisingly rare. Instead of the swarms found elsewhere, only six genera of oreodonts are known to have ranged there, and only one, Mesoreodon, is known from a single, good skeleton.  Lifestyle  The majority of oreodonts are presumed to have lived in herds, as suggested by the thousands of individuals in the various mass mortalities seen in the White River Badlands, Nebraska Oreodont beds, or Chula Vista, California.  Diversity  Merycoidodon from the Oligocene of Nebraska Oreodonts underwent a huge diversification during the Oligocene and Miocene, adapting to a number of ecological niches, including: *Semiaquatic – hippo- like Promerycochoerus *Trunked browser – tapir-like Brachycrus *Large grazer – cow-sized Eporeodon *Medium grazer – goat-like Merycoidodon *Small desert herbivore – goat- to cat-sized Sespia *Medium desert herbivore – Mesoreodon and the ubiquitous Leptauchenia  Classification  The family Merycoidodontidae is divided into eleven subfamilies, with four genera not included in any subfamily (incertae sedis) because they are either regarded as basal oreodonts, or their status within the family remains uncertain. *Family †Merycoidodontidae **subfamily incertae sedis ***†Aclistomycter ***†Merychyus ***†Pseudogenetochoerus ***†Pseudoleptauchenia **Subfamily †Oreonetinae ***†Bathygenys ***†Megabathygenys ***†Oreonetes **Subfamily †Leptaucheniinae ***Tribe †Leptaucheniini ****†Limnenetes ****†Leptauchenia ***Tribe †Sespiini ****†Sespia **Subfamily †Merycoidodontinae (syn.

It is part of the Capital District of the Province. Business and buildings Downtown Portland Alderney Located in downtown Dartmouth are Alderney Gate which houses a branch of the Halifax Public Libraries and other municipal office space, the Alderney Landing market, gallery and theatre building, the 19-story highrise office building Queen Square, as well as the main branches of the Royal Bank of Canada and CIBC. Also in the area there several condominium highrise buildings. The \\"Restaurant 73\\" building on 73 Alderney Drive is the oldest commercial brick building on the Dartmouth side of the harbour. Downtown Dartmouth also features historic landmarks such as the Quaker Whaler House, one of the oldest buildings in Halifax Regional Municipality (open to the public seasonally) and Evergreen House, Victorian home to nationally acclaimed folklorist, Helen Creighton (open year-round). Transportation Downtown Dartmouth is connected by ferry to downtown Halifax operated by Metro Transit from Alderney Landing. North America's oldest continually operating saltwater ferry service was started in 1752 by one man rowing customers across the harbour for three cents per trip. The three main streets are Alderney Drive (Trunk 7), Portland Street (Route 207), and Ochterloney Street. Along Alderney Drive and north of the downtown is the CN railyard. CN's Dartmouth Subdivision (a freight line) runs along the waterfront to Autoport near Eastern Passage.Train Geek: CN's Dartmouth Subdivision Parks Dartmouth Landing Ferry Terminal Park is the park space along the waterfront adjacent to the Dartmouth Ferry Terminal. In it resides the World Peace Pavilion, opened during the 1995 Halifax G7 Economic Summit. Conceived by Metro Youth for Global Unity, this structure contains stones and bricks donated by more than 70 countries, lying on a bed of Nova Scotian sand. Also within the Ferry Terminal Park is the huge bronze propeller from the CCGS John A. Macdonald, an icebreaker damaged during its 1969 journey through the Northwest Passage, as well as the inlaid granite compass rose in the park, which is a replica of the compass detail on a 1749 map of Halifax Harbour. Extending from Alderney Landing is the Events Plaza, a specially designed and equipped outdoor space for festivals and events. Eastern Front Theatre performs at Alderney Landing's theatre. The Leighton Dillman Scenic Garden, named after a diligent voluntary keeper of the gardens, sits adjacent to Alderney Drive on a hillside of what is left of the Dartmouth Commons, approximately set aside by the government in the late 18th century for the settlers' common use. Only a small portion of the Commons today remains. Past industry and redevelopment On Dartmouth Cove were the former Dartmouth Marine Slips, former site of the Nantucket Whaling Company. The Dartmouth Marine Slips were purchased in the 1990s by Irving Shipbuilding, owners of Halifax Shipyard which became known for a time as the Halifax Shipyards. Irving operating the two sites together with the marine slips specializing in smaller and faster repair jobs and employing about 44 people. In 2003, Irving announced plans to sell the Slips. Forty-four workers still employed at the shipyard were relocated to other Irving sites in the HRM region. The Dartmouth Marine Slips closed on June 20, 2003. The plans for development of the property, called Kings Wharf, were published in on July 31, 2007 and a long term construction program began in 2009. Plans for the tallest building in eastern Canada have been introduced and talked about for several years but construction has been delayed with no confirmed start date given.

They are best known for their 1963 song \\"Easier Said Than Done\\". Career Founding members Walter Vickers (guitar) and Rodney Taylor (drums) were members of the United States Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa, Japan. After being transferred to Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, they enlisted fellow Marines Billy Hill (aka Billy Proctor) and Rudolph Johnson as group members. Next they added a female lead singer, Anita Humes, another Marine. The band was signed to a recording contract in 1963 after submitting a demo to Roulette Records. \\"Easier Said Than Done\\" was written by Larry Huff and William Linton. Released as the B side of their first single, the song reached the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The track sold over one million records and received a gold disc award from the R.I.A.A. \\"Easier Said Than Done\\" charted at No. 41 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1963. Rudolph Johnson left the group, and the Essex became a quartet. Three months after \\"Easier Said Than Done\\" reached No. 1 in July 1963, the group had a No. 12 hit with the follow-up song, \\"A Walkin' Miracle\\" in September 1963. On the label of this single, the group name appeared as 'The Essex Featuring Anita Humes.' \\"She's Got Everything\\", their next single, written by Jimmy Radcliffe and Oramay Diamond, was a No. 56 hit. Being Marines made it hard for the group to take advantage of their hits; for example, before long, Johnson was posted to Okinawa. Rodney Taylor was killed in 1966 in New York City during an attempted mugging. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Gary, Indiana. All of his former bandmates attended his funeral. Humes released several solo singles for Roulette, but had no chart success. She died on May 30, 2010, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, aged 69. In the 1970s, Hill headed up a group called The Courtship.

This congregation is overseen by the Presbytery of Newton.Presbytery of Newton. \\"The Presbytery of Newton Encompasses Churches in Four Counties of New Jersey\\". Retrieved 30 April 2013. Many Hungarians were drawn to work at the region's center of iron mining, steel, railroad, and canal industries. Worship services were conducted in their native language. Joseph Wharton, the owner of the local steel mill, benefactor of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, and namesake of the community, donated the land where the Church is now located. In 1950, English language worship services were added to accommodate the original immigrants' children and grandchildren. After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Church was active in settling 61 refugee families into the Wharton area. Many became pillars of the Church and community. In 1964, the Church merged with the other Presbyterian Church in Wharton, the Luxemberg Presbyterian Church, to become the United Presbyterian Church of Wharton. This combination lasted until 1978, when both congregations decided to again spread the Word of our Lord separately. The Church today is composed of a combination of Hungarian immigrants, their American children and grandchildren, and the general population including recent Spanish speaking immigrants who adhere to Reformed theology. The Church is a member of the Presbyterian Church (USA) through the Newton Presbytery and is committed to the Confessing Church Movement within the Presbyterian Church (USA)[2].  Belief and Mission  The Church is founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ, as written in the Holy Bible. While many in the congregation are proud of their Hungarian heritage, many others are equally proud of other ancestry. The Church is firmly anchored in the Reformed Faith or what is commonly called Calvinism (Református). Worship services include separate English and Hungarian language services, with occasional combined language services. The Church's primary mission effort for the past several years has been as the major sponsor of the SonBeam Bible Camp in Košice, Slovakia. The largest minority group in Slovakia is people of Hungarian descent. Slovakia was long run by a Communist government, and as a result Christianity was not openly disseminated. This evangelical camp has brought many young people to know the love of our Lord. About 500 young people between the ages of 6 to 14 attend this summer Bible Camp every year at no charge; all camp staff are volunteers including 22 teachers, 4 Pastors, and a full-time doctor, only the food preparation staff is paid. In addition to hearing about the grace of God, the campers are also taught religious music by professional musicians, leaving time still for play and creative activities such as ceramics, paper art, painting, and making corn husk dolls.  Session and Staff  The Session of the Hungarian Presbyterian Church of Wharton, New Jersey consists of: Gabriella Ilkei, Stephen Lance, Jolan Szmetena, Ilonka Zajos.

OME also administers several contracts and special initiatives. The Office of Migrant Education was created out of a response from the public out-cry resulting from Edward R. Murrow's 1960 documentary \\"Harvest of Shame.\\" This documentary described the deplorable working conditions and interrupted educational experiences of many migrant children. Federal Migrant Education, was therefore, created to remediate the educational deficiencies that many migrant children had. The legal premise that supported the idea of migrant education was that all students regardless of national origin deserved an equal opportunity of access to high quality, fee public education. Administered programs The administered programs, as of June 2006, include: =College Assistance Migrant Program= (CAMP)- Assists migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their children to successfully complete the first undergraduate year of study in a college or university, and provides follow-up services to help students continue in postsecondary education. =High School Equivalency Program= (HEP) - Assists migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their children who are 16 years of age or older to obtain a High School Equivalency (HSE) certificate or the equivalent to a high school diploma and subsequently to gain employment in a career position or the military or entry into postsecondary education. Since most HEP programs are located at Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), migrant and seasonal farmworkers also have opportunities to attend cultural events, academic programs, and other educational and cultural activities usually not available to them. =MEP Consortium Incentive Grants= On an annual basis, the Secretary may reserve up to $3 million to award grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) that participate in a consortium arrangement with another State or appropriate entity to improve the delivery of services to migrant children whose education is interrupted. The grants are used by the SEAs to provide additional direct educational and support services to migrant children. =Migrant Education Coordination Support Center= A logistics and project support services contract that provides the logistical support and technical assistance needed to arrange effective meetings and facilitate special projects that are national in scope and are in support of the interstate and intrastate coordination of migrant education programs. =Migrant Education Even Start (MEES)= MEES is designed to help break the cycle of poverty and improve the literacy of participating migrant families by integrating early childhood education, parenting education, and adult literacy or adult basic education (including English language training, as appropriate) into a unified family literacy program. MEES is funded from a three percent set-aside under the Even Start Family Literacy State Grants program. Grants are made directly to projects in areas that include significant concentrations of migrant agricultural families with children from birth through 3 years of age. =Migrant Education National Hotline (ESCORT)= The Hotline provides a toll-free number (800-234-8848) for migrant farm workers and their families to call from anywhere in the country. The Hotline is designed to help enroll migrant children in school and to access migrant education program services. Hotline specialists, who take calls, also refer callers to appropriate agencies and organizations when they are seeking other supportive services, such as housing, transportation, health or legal aid. =Title I Migrant Education Program (MEP)= The MEP provides formula grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to establish or improve programs of education for migratory children. The overarching purpose of the MEP is to ensure that children of migrant workers have access to and benefit from the same free, appropriate public education, including public preschool education, provided to other children. To achieve this purpose, MEP funds help state and local educational agencies remove barriers to the school enrollment, attendance, and achievement of migrant children.

Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, Cedar City, UT. 81 pp. Utah prairie dogs are only found in the southern part of Utah; today they are only found in the central and southwestern part of Utah in Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane, Piute, Sevier, and Wayne Counties. However, it was recorded that Utah prairie dogs existed as far north as Nephi, and south to Bryce Canyon National Park, and Aquarius Plateau to the east in 1920, but the number declined from the 1920s to 1970s by 87%, and this was thought due to human settlers who caused overgrazing of soil, thus catalyzed the invasion of shrub to the grass land. =Diet= Utah prairie dogs are mainly herbivores, but they sometimes choose small insects also, such as cicadas.Hoogland, J. L. 2003a. Black-tailed prairie dog: Cynomys ludovicianus and allies. Pp. 232–247 in Wild mammals of North America (G. A. Feldhamer, B. C. Thompson, and J. A. Chapman, eds.).

Journal of Mammalogy 82:917-927 =Reproduction= Utah prairie dog shows polyandry behavior, and lays only one litter per year, which generally consists of 1 to 8 litter size.Hoogland, J. L. 2013. Why do female prairie dogs copulate with more than one male?—Insights from long-term research. Journal of Mammalogy, 94(4), 731-744. The breeding occurs generally from mid-March through early April. =Behavior= They build extensive \\"towns\\" of tunnels and chambers, each town composed of a population of members of an extended prairie dog family group called “clan”, and they forage from dawn to dusk. Conservation status The species appears in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with a status of Endangered, last assessed in 2008. The Utah prairie dog is listed as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1972, studies estimated a population of 3,300 Utah prairie dogs in 37 colonies. Studies by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources in spring 2004 reported 4,022 Utah prairie dogs, a number believed to reflect half of the total current population. The Utah prairie dog can do significant damage to farms by digging holes and eating crops, drawing the ire of Utah farmers, who have used poison liberally to destroy the animal. This is a major reason for the population decline, though there are other factors, such as \\"land development, deteriorating rangeland health, the encroachment of woody vegetation, sylvatic plague, and drought.\\" Conservation efforts include encouraging landowners to improve the health of their rangelands, and compensating farmers who set aside areas the prairie dogs may use.

These are cars that were disbanded when the UK national Formula Ford category adopted the 1800cc Zetec engines in 1993. However, has been running as several regional club championships ever since and has recently enjoyed renewed success. Several cars constructed to Zetec rules have been converted to accept a Kent engine, as well as the Duratec powered cars that followed. There have also been several recent purpose-built kent cars which have enjoyed successes. Championships In the British Isles, several championships are in existence for this type of car. These are; Castle Combe, which races exclusively at the Wiltshire venue of the same name with classes for cars constructed after 1995, 1990 and before 1990 with the championship winner being decided by which driver has the best results irrespective of class; Midlands-South, which is an amalgamation of the former Star of the Midlands and Motor Sport Vision championships and races at Mallory Park, Silverstone, Snetterton and Brands Hatch, with a comparable class structure to Castle Combe, except that the Pre 1990 class is divided into cars constructed between 1985 and 1990, cars constructed before 1985 and cars constructed before 1980. An identical class structure is used in the North West series which races at Oulton Park in Cheshire and Ty Croes in Anglesey. However, due to the number of competitors, races are held for cars constructed before and after 1990, with separate champions being crowned. National championships exist for the Classic championship which caters for cars manufactured between 1974 and 1982 and pre-1974. However, the championship is awarded to the driver with the best results in the 1974-1982 class, irrespective of the results of any competitor driving a car built before 1974. The Historic Sports Car Club organises a championship for cars constructed before 1971, which also features a race at Croix-en-Ternois in France. There is also the Northern Irish championship which is for cars of any age and races predominantly at Kirkistown, with additional races held at Oulton Park and Mondello Park, in the Republic of Ireland. Finally, an Irish championship is held, with the bulk of races held at Mondello Park as well as the aforementioned Kirkistown and Pembrey in Wales. An innovation within this championship is that Class A is intended for the serious championship contender, whilst Class B is for drivers competing solely for their own enjoyment, regardless of the age of their car. There is also the Scottish championship which races predominantly at Knockhill but is set to host one race weekend at Croft, it is organised by the Scottish Motor Racing Club. An interesting element of Formula Ford 1600 racing is that a pre 1971 car is eligible for every other championship run, meaning that the driver of such a car could conceivably race every weekend if they so desired. Trophy Events A notable feature of the Formula Ford 1600 calendar is the presence of one-off ‘Trophy Events’. These bring together drivers, regardless of championship they contest for a series of races without any class structure. Notable examples include the Castle Combe Carnival, the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, the Edwina Overend Memory Trophy at Mallory Park and the Anglesey Circuit Club’s December Trophy. In addition, the BRDC arranges a number of races, such as the Cheshire Trophy at Oulton Park, the Chris Mudge Memorial Trophy and a race at Scotland’s Knockhill circuit; these culminate in November’s Walter Hayes Trophy at Silverstone which features up to 200 drivers, including some more famous names, such as, Neil Cunningham, Danny Watts, Steven Kane and Joey Foster. Constructors Despite the homogeneity of mechanicals, the number of car constructors is vast, which include; Van Diemen, Swift, Mygale, Reynard, Vector, Crossle, Royale, Hawke, Mallock, Merlyn, Palliser, Macon, Lotus, Elden, Lola, Brabham, Titan, Jamun and Nike.

He first appeared in The Eternals #11 (May 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby. He is a member of the Eternals, a race of superhumans in the Marvel Universe. Barry Keoghan portrays Druig in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in Eternals (2021). Publication history Druig first appeared in The Eternals #11 (May 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby. The character subsequently appears in Eternals Vol. 1 #17-19 (November 1977-January 1978), and Thor Annual #7 (1978). After disappearing for some time, the character returns in Captain Marvel #5 (April 1996) and later reappears in the mini-series The Eternals written by Neil Gaiman, in Eternals Vol. 3 #3-4 (November–October 2006), and #6-7 (January–March 2007). Druig received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #4 (2007). Fictional character biography Druig is the son of Valkin and cousin to Ikaris. In modern times, Druig served as an agent of the KGB in Russia, and found that he enjoyed torturing people. When Ziran the Tester came through Polaria, Druig planned to slay him using \\"the Weapon\\", which he had learned of by torturing his cousin Ikaris, but Ikaris disintegrated Druig before he could fire the Weapon.Eternals #11 His body was then recovered by the Celestials, and put into everlasting containment at the Desecration Annex.The Eternals #6 =Eternals (2006)= Much later, Druig is now deputy Prime Minister of Vorozheika (a fictional country to the northeast of Chechnya, formerly part of the USSR) and is currently using the name Ivan Druig. Druig hires Sersi to organize a party at the Vorozheikan embassy, asking her to invite wealthy guests and prominent scientists. He then arranges for armed men to storm the party, kidnapping the scientists and manufacturing a hostage situation - however, his troops betrayed him and he swiftly lost control of the situation. At this point, like Mark Curry, Druig's powers inexplicably \\"kick in\\". Unlike Mark Curry though, he immediately gains some control over his powers. He has displayed a limited form of telepathy, allowing him to view a person's most traumatic memory - and then immobilise them by forcing them to face that memory again. However, he does not appear to be able to read other memories from a target's mind. Druig also seems able to conceal his presence, by influencing the minds of others so that they do not see him - so far, the limits of this ability are unclear. Returning to Vorozheika, Druig then seizes control of an army unit and then quickly rounds up all heads of the government. He then has all the people involved in the betrayal at the embassy dragged before him and the government heads, and gives the heads a choice. They either kill a betrayer, or kill themselves. After one government head tries killing Druig, and is then forced to kill himself, the other heads all turn on the betrayers. He then leaves to find the other Eternals, and help them prevent the Dreaming Celestial from destroying the Earth. In the end of the series, he remains absolute ruler of Vorozheika. While he in fact despises the people of Vorozheika, seeing them all as beneath him, he gladly uses his position to send out people in his intelligence services to find other \\"unawakened\\" Eternals before Thena and Ikaris, so as to mold their mind in their weakened state into following him, and using their combined forces to become the leader of the Eternals. Powers and abilities Druig possesses the conventional abilities of an Eternal; he can manipulate all forms of matter and energy, including the atoms of his own body. He can teleport, manipulate gravitons in order to fly, control the minds of others, and project energy from his body, usually from the hands or eyes.

In 2011, a new, sixth level was added: Ambassadors. Girl Scouts move or \\"bridge\\" to the next level, usually at the end of the school year they reach the age of advancing. They are considered in the appropriate level based on their grade on October 1, the start of each new Girl Scout year. There are exceptions for \\"special needs,\\" but Girl Scouts who are \\"young in grade\\" have not been specifically considered. Each year of membership in Girl Scouting is represented on the uniform by a small, golden, six-pointed membership star (one per year) with colored background discs which represent a level. Girl Scouts wear uniforms consisting of a white shirt and khaki bottom under the appropriate uniform item for their level: a blue tunic or vest for Daisies (kindergarten and grade 1), a brown sash or vest for Brownies (grades 2-3), a green vest or sash for Juniors (grades 4-5) and a tan sash or vest for the older girl levels of Cadettes (grades 6-8), Seniors (grades 9-10) and Ambassadors grades (11-12). All uniform tunics, vests, or sashes must include the American flag patch, council ID patches troop numbers, and a tab with the WAGGGS pin and the membership pin. Daisies Daisy is the initial level of Girl Scouting. Named for Juliette \\"Daisy\\" Gordon Low, they are in kindergarten and first grade (around ages 5–7). They meet in minimally groups of five girls with two adult leaders who help the girls plan activities to introduce them to Girl Scouts. Daisies earn the Promise Center and Petals, which focus on the Girl Scout Law and are placed on the front of the tunic in a daisy design. They also earn Leaves and Journey Leadership Awards. Their uniform consists of a light blue tunic. They may also wear their tunic with a white shirt and khaki bottoms or with an official Girl Scout Daisy uniform. The Girl Scout Membership Star is worn with blue membership disks and they wear the Girl Scout Daisy Membership Pin. Daisies use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Daisies and the National Leadership Journeys to work on activities, may camp only with a parent present, and have the option to sell Girl Scout cookies. They may earn the Daisy Safety Award and the Bridge to Brownies Award. Brownies Brownies are in second and third grades (around ages 7–9). and earn triangular shaped Brownie Leadership Journey Awards and National Proficiency Badges. Their uniform consists of a brown vest or sash which may be worn with a white shirt and khaki bottoms or with an official Brownie uniform. The Girl Scout Membership Star is worn with green membership disks, and they wear the Brownie Membership Pin. Brownies use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Brownies and the National Leadership Journeys to work on badges and activities. They may earn the Bridge to Juniors Award and the Brownie Safety Award. Unlike some of the other levels, the name Brownie is commonly used with Girl Scout/Girl Guide organizations around the world and has its origin from Brownies in the British Girl Guides. Juniors Juniors are in fourth and fifth grades (around ages 9–11). Their uniform is a green vest or sash which may be worn with a white shirt and khaki bottoms. Juniors are the first level to wear the official Girl Scout Membership Pin on their uniform. The Girl Scout Membership Star is worn with yellow membership disks. They use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Juniors and the National Leadership Journeys to work on badges and activities. They earn circle shaped Junior Leadership Journey Awards and National Proficiency Badges. Badges require more skill at this level as the girls gain proficiency. They may earn the Girl Scout Junior Safety Award, the Junior Aide Award, and the Bridge to Cadettes Award. Juniors are eligible to earn the Bronze Award, the highest award in Girl Scouting available at this level. Cadettes Cadettes are Girl Scouts who are in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades (around ages 11–14). Their uniform is a khaki vest or sash with white shirts and khaki bottoms. They wear the official Girl Scout Membership Pin on their uniform. The Girl Scout Membership Star is worn with white membership disks. Cadettes use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Cadettes and the National Leadership Journeys to earn diamond shaped badges. Typically, Girl Scouts at this level are encouraged to assume leadership roles within them, such as assisting in leading and coordinating service unit or association events. They may also earn the Cadette Program Aide award, the Cadette Community Service Bar, the Cadette Service to Girl Scouting Bar, the Cadette Safety Award and the Bridge to Senior Award. They are eligible to earn the Silver Award, which is the highest award available to girls at this level. Seniors Seniors are Girl Scouts who are in ninth and tenth grade (around ages 14–16). Their wear the same uniform as Cadettes—however, the disks for their membership stars are red and their badges are a rectangular shape. Seniors use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Seniors and the National Leadership Journeys to earn badges. They are typically encouraged to create and lead activities for the younger Girl Scouts, and to take a leadership role in organizing and assisting with Council and service unit/association events and activities. They may earn the Counselor-in-Training (CIT), the Volunteer-in-Training (VIT), the Girl Scout Senior Safety Award, the Gold Torch Award, the Senior Community Service Bar, the Senior Service to Girl Scouting Bar and the Bridge to Girl Scout Ambassador award. Seniors are eligible to earn the Gold Award. Ambassadors Ambassadors are Girl Scouts who are in eleventh and twelfth grade (around ages 16-18). They wear the same khaki colored vest or sash as Cadettes and Seniors. The Girl Scout Membership Star is worn with navy membership disks. Ambassadors use the Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting for Ambassadors and the National Leadership Journeys to earn badges that are shaped like an octagon. They may earn the Counselor-in-Training (CIT), the Counselor-in-Training (CIT) II, the Volunteer-in-Training (VIT), the Ambassador Community Service Bar, the Ambassador Service to Girl Scouting Bar, the Gold Torch Award, the Ambassador Safety Award, and the Bridge to Adult Award. Ambassadors are eligible to earn the Gold Award. Adults Adults, both men and women, can join Girl Scouts and participate as leaders or in other volunteer roles. They do not need to have a child in the program in order to volunteer with Girl Scouts. History Initially the United States Girl Scout program, started in 1912, had one level for girls ages ten through seventeen, but it soon added two more levels. Brownies for younger girls was officially recognized in the mid-1920s though it had existed earlier. At the same time older girls (over eighteen or over sixteen if First Class Scouts) became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938 age divisions were set as * Brownies (ages seven through nine) * Intermediates (ages ten through thirteen) * Seniors (ages fourteen through seventeen) In 1963 this was rearranged to * Brownies (ages seven through nine) * Juniors (ages nine through eleven) * Cadettes (ages eleven through fourteen) * Seniors (ages fourteen through seventeen) In the 1970s the age divisions were * Pixies (ages five through six) Pixies was a pilot program, available only in limited areas. * Brownies (ages seven through nine) * Juniors (ages nine through eleven) * Cadettes (ages eleven through fourteen) * Seniors (ages fourteen through seventeen) In 1984, the Daisy program for kindergartners (age five) was introduced, and around 2003 the Studio 2B program for girls eleven through seventeen was introduced as a way to give older girls more options in Girl Scouts, although many girls still called themselves Cadettes and Seniors. STUDIO 2B was discontinued as a program option in 2007. * Daisies (5-6 years old or in kindergarten) * Brownies (6–8 years old or in grades 1–3) * Juniors (8–12 years old or in grades 4–6. In some situations, girls age eight and in third grade may be Juniors.) * Cadettes (12–13 years old or in grades 7–8) * Seniors (14–17 years old or in grades 9–12)http://www.main.org/gsusa/division.htm Lone Star Girl Scout Council In 2008 another reorganization took place. The Ambassador level was added in 2011. All levels were changed to have Girl Scouts at the start of their name, e.g. \\"Girl Scout Brownies\\" instead of \\"Brownie Girl Scouts\\", and levels were changed to be by grade only instead of by age or grade. * Daisies (grades K–1) * Brownies (grades 2–3) * Juniors (grades 4–5) * Cadettes (grades 6–8) * Seniors (grades 9–10) * Ambassadors (grades 11–12) Outside the age level programs, there have been somewhat separate programs for Mariner Scouts (1934–present) and Wing Scouts (1941–1970s). In addition, there are Girl Scouts known as Juliettes, who are independent of any troop due to lack of a troop to join or because other commitments do not allow them to actively participate with available troops. A Juliette is still placed in her appropriate grade level and works on program as would any other girl her age in a regular troop.

The track opened to the public in the spring of 1950 and has operated for at least a part of every year since. The track was an early home to racing stars Ray Evernham and the Truex family of Martin Sr., Martin Jr. and Ryan Truex. Also, it hosted a NASCAR Convertible Series race in 1956 and a NASCAR Grand National Series event in 1958. The more prominent drivers over the years have included Gil Hearne (eight-time champion), Tommie Elliott (the youngest driver ever to race in NASCAR's highest division) and Charlie Kremer Jr. (both four-time champions), John Blewett III, Jimmy Blewett (four time champion), Jimmy Spencer (Garden State Classic winner), Tony Siscone (six-time champion), Richie Evans, and Charlie Jarzombek (Garden State Classic winner). Wall Stadium is also known for hosting Round 4: The Gauntlet of the Formula DRIFT Pro Championship. History =Origins= Founders Tom and Jennie Nicol sought to build their own racetrack after enjoying stock car racing at Long Branch Speedway. The couple bought 55 acres of land off Route 34 in Wall Township and built a one-third mile oval with 30° banking in the turns, unheard of at the time. Racing began in 1950 with the annual Turkey Derby capping each season on the Saturday following Thanksgiving Day beginning in 1974.Wall Stadium-Track History, retrieved 2011-01-09. =New ownership= After the 2001 season, the late Jennie Nicol's son Tucker (Thomas Nicol, Jr.) decided to sell the speedway and, it was purchased by Timothy Shinn. His co- owners were Tom Mauser, Joe Sanzari, and Fletcher Creamer for the 2002 season. The track was retitled Wall Township Speedway. After two months, Mauser was dismissed as the Track Operations Manager. In 2004, Fred Archer came to the fold as co-owner. By 2005, car counts and capacity crowd started to decline and, there were rumors swirling about the track's pending demise. =Demise= After the 2007 season, several employees were laid off. The track closed on March 14, 2008, with the track's marquee reading CLOSED FOR GOOD. =Revival= After eleven months sitting inactive, former track operations manager Jim Morton secured a lease to operate the race track for one race, the traditional season ending Turkey Derby in November 2008, and the crowd was overwhelming for what was the track's only race of the season. The track officially reopened for a full season of racing in 2009, capped by the Turkey Derby. The name was changed back to the familiar \\"Wall Stadium\\". The 2010 season started as usual, but as of September 2, 2010, the track closed once more, due to the expiration of Morton's lease on the property. The marquee, which earlier that week had noted the weekend's upcoming races, simply read \\"Racing cancelled till further notice\\".\\"Wall Stadium closed, races cancelled\\", Asbury Park Press, 09-03-2010, retrieved 09-05-2010 However, the 37th annual Turkey Derby ran as scheduled on November 26 and 27, under the terms of a short-term lease to Don Ling and the Blewett family. The track was put up for sale shortly thereafter with an asking price of $18 million. Racing resumed in 2011 under new management. Cliff Krause of Holmdel signed a one-year lease with track owners to conduct a full schedule of races.Wall Township Speedway website. Retrieved 2011-01-07. After running a full schedule of races, Krause secured a three-year extension on the track's lease after the 2011 Turkey Derby. After its three-year deal, the Krauses signed one more agreement for 2015. Annual lease renewals have been signed in subsequent years. A 1/5 mile oval flat track was added for ATQMRA and Karting events. =Modifieds dropped from schedule= For several years, two different Modified classes competed at Wall Stadium, the more traditional \\"Tour Type\\" Modifieds, considered to be the top tier series, and the Modified Affordable Division (MAD), similar to the Stafford Motor Speedway SK Modified division, using small block engines and narrower tires, to reduce costs. Because of a purse structure dispute, in 1993, the Tour Type Modified division left the weekly feature at the track for the now defunct Flemington Speedway. Currently, the Modified division has rules similar to Stafford's SK Modified, although Tour Type cars participate in the Turkey Derby. Events ; NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour The 2003 season, hosted a NASCAR (then Featherlite) Whelen Modified Tour event. The race was contested at 150 laps, and that race was held the next year (2004), but was quickly dropped from their future scheduling. In 2007, the cars returned to the speedway after, being absent from the schedule for two seasons, and it hosted a \\"Flash\\" event with a pair of 50 lap races, and the feature is the final 50. The NASCAR Modified Tour wasn't scheduled again for the following season, in 2008. In 2019 after a 12 year absence, the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour returned to schedule for one race yearly visit. The event, was canceled from the schedule due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020. ; Turkey Derby After the 1974 season, the management/staff added a race for the Thanksgiving weekend, entitled \\"Turkey Derby\\", a 150-lap open competition race for Modified stock cars which attracted many of the top drivers in the division. After a successful debut, the race grew in stature and popularity and, in 1981, attracted a record field of 75 cars including NASCAR National Champion Richie Evans. From 1974–1992, the Modified race was contested as a 150-lap event. When the years went by, the format had been changed to three 50 lap events, if the driver finishes in a certain spot, he will be declared the overall winner. The Tour Type modifieds (to refer to big block engines, similar to that of the Valenti Modified Racing Series and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour cars), returned in 2002 it was 150 laps. In 2004, it was 125 laps. From 2004–2009, it was 100; since 2010, it has been 150 laps. ; Garden State Classic The Garden State Classic was established in 1957. The format of the event was first consisted of a 300-lap event, originally a NASCAR National Championship Modified race. When the 1980s started, it was cut to 200 laps (to eliminate pit stops, which were impractical at the track, and save the race teams much additional expense. The purse remained the same), 100 laps (1993–2002), Twin 50's (2003), 100 laps (2004–2007), 150 (2009–2010), and 125 laps (2011–present).

The Independent Film Channel said that Pyun \\"has carved out a unique niche as a director of low-budget, high-concept genre films starring actors past their prime\\", adding that \\"others believe this a charitable description for Pyun, who has also been derided as the new Ed Wood.\\" Though he frequently blends kickboxing and hybrid martial arts with science fiction and dystopic or post-apocalyptic themes, which often include cyborgs, Pyun stated in an interview that \\"I have really no interest in cyborgs. And I've never really had any interest in post- apocalyptic stories or settings. It just seemed that those situations presented a way for me to make movies with very little money, and to explore ideas that I really wanted to explore — even if they were [controversial].\\" Pyun's films include The Sword and the Sorcerer, Cyborg, Captain America, and Nemesis. Pyun was a military brat and lived on bases around the world until his father settled in Hawaii. Pyun went to school in Kailua, a small town located on the windward side of Oahu. Pyun's first 8mm and 16mm movies were made in Kailua and he credits living in foreign countries and growing up in Hawaii as strong influences on his filmmaking style. Early career While in high school, Pyun worked at a number of production houses in Honolulu before receiving an invitation by the Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune, to travel to Japan for an internship. Initially Pyun was to intern on the Akira Kurosawa film, Dersu Uzala, which was to star Mifune but the actor decided not to do the film and instead Pyun found himself working on a Mifune TV series under the tutelage of Kurosawa's Director of Photography, Takao Saito (Red Beard). Pyun returned to Hawaii and began working as a commercial film editor at KGMB in Honolulu and edited commercials for agencies such as Bozell Jacobs and Leo Burnett. After several years as an editor, Pyun moved to Los Angeles to become a feature film director. 1980s Pyun's first film The Sword and the Sorcerer remains his highest grossing, eventually earning $36,714,025 in the United States. Opening on April 30, 1982, it grossed $4,100,886 which ranked the film second that week in America. Richard Lynch received the Best Supporting Actor Saturn Award for his performance as Cromwell. During the production of the film stuntman Jack Tyree was killed while doing a high fall stunt at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. While performing a 78-foot fall in heavy costume and makeup, Tyree struck his airbag off center, resulting in a fatal impact. With the success of The Sword and the Sorcerer, Pyun was attached to several science fiction projects in 1984 including Total Recall, to be produced by Dino DeLaurentiis at Universal Pictures, with a screenplay based on the Philip K. Dick story written by Ronald Shusett (Alien). At the time, William Hurt was attached to star. His second film, Radioactive Dreams, was awarded the Golden Raven at the 5th Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival in 1987. \\"Radioactive Dreams\\" recently screened at Exhumed Films' 2013 eX Fest. Pyun's career took a more mainstream turn with the thriller Dangerously Close, and the romantic adventure film, Down Twisted, starring Carey Lowell, Charles Rocket, and Courteney Cox. In the late 1980s, Pyun made Alien from L.A., featuring supermodel Kathy Ireland; the film was later mocked on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. This episode was released on DVD in March 2013. Pyun's Cyborg opened as the fourth highest-grossing film in America on April 7, 1989. It eventually grossed $10,166,459 in the United States. 22 years after making \\"Cyborg,\\" Pyun released his director's cut in 2011. A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer re-release on Blu-ray followed in October 2012. In 1989, Pyun made Deceit, and Captain America. A director's cut of Captain America was released in May 2011. 1990s In the early 1990s, Pyun made Nemesis with Olivier Gruner and Thomas Jane; Brainsmasher... A Love Story followed in 1993 with Teri Hatcher and Andrew Dice Clay; and Mean Guns with Christopher Lambert and Ice-T in 1997. In June 1991, Pyun's film Kickboxer 2, written by David Goyer (Ghost Rider, Blade, The Dark Knight), opened in theaters to mixed reviews. Other 1990s films include: Knights with Kris Kristofferson, Kathy Long and Lance Henriksen; \\"Dollman\\" starring Tim Thomerson as a 13 inch tall Dirty Harry type cop from another planet. Jackie Early Haley played the villain; Raven Hawk with Rachel McLish and William Atherton; Spitfire with Henriksen, Sarah Douglas, Tim Thomerson and Kristie Phillips; Hong Kong '97 with Robert Patrick and Ming-Na Wen; Adrenalin: Fear the Rush with Christopher Lambert and Natasha Henstridge; Post Mortem with Charlie Sheen; Crazy Six with Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and Burt Reynolds; Omega Doom with Rutger Hauer and Shannon Whirry; Arcade with Megan Ward, Seth Green, Peter Billingsly and John Delancie. Pyun also made his only episodic TV work to date for the NBC/Columbia Tri-Star show The Fifth Corner with Alex McArthur, Kim Delaney and James Coburn. 2000s Pyun directed and produced Ticker for Artisan Entertainment in May 2000, which featured Steven Seagal, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Hopper, Jaime Pressly, Nas and Ice-T plus Chilli of the R&B; group TLC. In 2002 it was among five films honored for sales by the Video Software Dealers Association in the category of Direct-To-Video/Limited Release By An Independent Studio. In 2004 Pyun went to the U.S. territory of Guam and, along with film producer John Laing, convinced the Guam government to put up an $800,000 loan guarantee to finance their film Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon. In his effort to convince Guam officials to approve the loan guarantee, Pyun told them that he and his producer (Laing) had a \\"sterling financial record\\" and that neither he nor John Laing had ever defaulted on a loan. In 2006 Laing defaulted on the loan, and Guam lost its guarantee. Laing blamed Pyun for the failure of the film. An out of court settlement was reached between John Laing and the Guam Economic Development Authority in May 2012 but up until October 2012 Laing has not honored the terms of that settlement. In late 2012 GEDA Administrator Karl Pangelinan reported Laing had made a $75,000 payment on the balance of the settlement amount and the balance outstanding was $75,000. GEDA officials confirmed the final payment was made in February 2013 bringing the matter to a close. Pyun was not involved in any of the legal litigation between GEDA and Laing. In September 2008, Pyun began production on Tales of an Ancient Empire. Shooting began on October 12, 2008. The film premiered at Louisville, Kentucky's Fright Night Film Fest. The film was eventually released by Lions Gate Films in January 2012 and stars Kevin Sorbo, Michael Paré, Melissa Ordway and Ralf Moeller. 2010s Pyun's film Road to Hell won the Best Picture award at the Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival in Belfast in 2011. Later in 2012, it opened the PollyGrind Film Festival in Las Vegas where it won Best Fantasy Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Song, Best Use of Songs, Best Use of Music, Best Visual Effects, Best Screenplay, and the Newcomer Award. In late 2013, Pyun announced he had multiple sclerosis.Twitch Film In March 2014, Pyun's health had improved enough for him to film The Interrogation of Cheryl Cooper.Dread Central He also has dementia.https://www.bulletproofaction.com/2017/06/27/an-interview-with- albert- pyun/https://twitter.com/albertpyunfilms/status/698544248195543040?lang=enhttp://bzfilm.com/articles- notes/albert-pyun-seeks-funding-for-new-film/ Awards * 2005 – Golden Unicorn Award for lifetime achievement at the Estepona International Film Festival of Fantasy and Horror. * 2011 – Induction into the B-movie Hall of Fame at the B-Movie Celebration. * 2012 – Lifetime Achievement-Filmmaker of a Different Breed Award at the PollyGrind Film Festival. * 2013 – Groundbreaker Award – BUT FILM FESTIVAL (Breda, Netherlands) * 2013 – Indie Genre Spirit Award – Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival Selected filmography * The Sword and the Sorcerer (1982) * Radioactive Dreams (1985) * Dangerously Close (1986) * Vicious Lips (1986) * Down Twisted (1987) * Alien from L.A.

Immigration The brothers, Joseph Brooks (1802–1835), George (1805–1875) and Edward (1814–1893), founded their establishment at Otago Heads in 1831, the first enduring European settlement in what is now the City of Dunedin. Members of a wealthy land- owning family from Folkestone, Kent, they moved serially to Australia, partly to alleviate Joseph Brooks Weller’s tuberculosis. Joseph Brooks left England on 20 October 1823.Weller Family Tree: Joseph Brooks He arrived in Hobart on 4 February 1824 and then went to Sydney. After 18 months he returned to England, and left there for good on 1 January 1827 accompanied by Edward. In the meantime George had already left England and arrived in Australia in March 1826.Weller Family Tree: George and had bought the Albion. By 1830 Joseph Brooks, Edward, George and his new wife, Elizabeth (formerly Barwise), their parents, Joseph (1766–1857) and Mary (née Brooks) (b.1779), and two sisters, Fanny (1812–1896) and Ann (1822–1887), were all in Sydney. Development of trading Joseph Brooks Weller interested himself in flax and timber trading at the Hokianga. In 1831 he called at William Cook's shipbuilding settlement at Stewart Island/Rakiura to commission a vessel before visiting Otago in the Sir George Murray, reaching an agreement with Tahatu and claiming territory for William IV. He returned in the Lucy Ann with goods and gear to establish a whaling station, (it is believed with Edward) in November. George and his wife came too, or arrived soon after. The Wellers continued to trade in flax and spars, maintaining operations at the Hokianga even as they developed Otago. At that time and throughout the decade they were the only merchants regularly trading from one end of New Zealand to the other. A fire soon destroyed the Otago station, but it was rebuilt. Edward was kidnapped by Māori in the far north and ransomed. Whale products started flowing from Otago in 1833 where Joseph Brooks based himself and European women went to settle. Relations with Māori were often tense, the establishment being ransacked and the Wellers keeping Māori hostages in Sydney, reverberations from earlier conflicts (Sealers' War). Joseph Brooks died at Otago in 1835, and his brother Edward shipped his remains to Sydney in a puncheon of rum. At 21 Edward became the resident manager while George maintained the Sydney end of the business. At this time there were 80 Europeans at Otago which had become a trading, transshipment and ship service centre as well as a whaling station. A measles epidemic greatly reduced the Māori population. Further developments New fisheries were established inside the harbour and up and down the coast. The Wellers' ships cruised beyond Australasia and they tested the tax regime preventing direct shipment of whale products to Britain. Edward made strategic marriages to a daughter of Tahatu, Paparu, and after her death to Taiaroa’s daughter, Nikuru. There were daughters, Fanny and Nani, by each alliance. By the end of the 1830s, exports of whale products (southern right or humpback whales) were at a peak, the station taking about 300 southern right whales on the first season, as was the resident European population. Anticipating British annexation the Wellers started buying land and settling it. But a sudden decline in whales saw Edward's exit at the end of 1840 followed by the firm’s bankruptcy. He and George lived out their lives in New South Wales. Otago, now the name of their settlement, reached a nadir in 1842 but revived, remaining the centre of port operations until after the establishment of Port Chalmers and Dunedin. As \\"Otakou\\" it is still the home of Pākehā and Māori. Notes References * *The Weller Brothers in the 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand *Entwisle, P. in Griffiths G.

M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up and 1911 novel Peter and Wendy. History Mr. Smee seems an oddly genial man for a pirate; Barrie describes him as \\"Irish\\", the only Nonconformist among Hook's crew, and \\"a man who stabbed without offence\\" – and is portrayed in the multiple pantomimes or movies of Peter Pan as a rather stupid but entertaining man interested in loot rather than Hook's more evil pleasures. Smee typically represents a humorous side to pirating, often portrayed as a portly man with a bulbous nose and red cheeks, although Barrie hinted at a darker side. When captured by Hook, every child in the brig loves Smee – he cannot lay a fist on them and does their darning – despite his belief that they fear him. Hook considers that Smee has good form without knowing it, which is of course the best form of all. He almost tears into Smee for this but knows that clawing a man for having good form is very bad form. Smee offers to save Wendy from the plank, if only she promises to be his mother – an offer she refuses, in Barrie's words, \\"Not even for Smee\\". Smee's position on the Jolly Roger is presented inconsistently (in a sense, it could be said that \\"no two 'Smees' are alike\\"). In Peter and Wendy, he is identified as the ship's boatswain. He is one of two pirates (the other being Starkey) who survive the final battle between the children and the pirates, and \\"henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.\\" In Peter Pan in Scarlet, he has moved into the Underground Home of the Lost Boys. He leaves Neverland by the end of the book and opens up a shop in London that sells souvenirs collected from Neverland. Adaptations =Disney version= Mr. Smee appears in Walt Disney's 1953 film version of Peter Pan voiced by Bill Thompson, and in the 2002 sequel Return to Never Land voiced by Jeff Bennett. In this version, he serves as Captain Hook's first mate. He is also Hook's assistant, although he is sometimes referred to as the cook. In the first film, he is never referred to as the first mate but consistently acts as one to Captain Hook (though with varying degrees of personal loyalty). Mr. Smee appeared in the Kingdom Hearts video game series voiced by Jeff Bennett. He appears as one of the main characters in the Disney Junior TV show Jake and the Never Land Pirates. He also appears in a cameo in the Disney Fairies film The Pirate Fairy. Both are voiced by Jeff Bennett. Mr. Smee is interpreted in Disney Channel's live- action film Descendants 3 by actor Faustino Di Bauda. Mr. Smee appears in the Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character alongside Captain Hook in Adventureland. =Peter Pan and the Pirates= In Peter Pan and the Pirates, Mr. Smee (voiced by Ed Gilbert in an Irish accent) is Captain Hook's right- hand man. His weapon is named Johnny Corkscrew. He is small, but not very thick, has grey hair and pale blue eyes. His biggest difference from the other pirates is that he is often clumsy and not really able to capture one of the Lost Boys (as seen in \\"Slightly Duped\\" and \\"Play Ball\\"). =Hook= In Steven Spielberg's 1991 film Hook, Smee (played by Bob Hoskins) and Hook's relationship takes on an almost intimate tone, at times even resembling an old married couple or a master/servant arrangement. Smee is allowed access to Hook's private quarters, is seen preparing meals for the Captain and even helps him disrobe before bed. When Hook threatens suicide, he makes it obvious that he expects Smee to stop him, to which Smee replies \\"not again\\". Hook also confides all of his darkest and most personal thoughts and concerns to Smee, seemingly exclusively. When Hook claims (untruthfully) that he wants to die, Smee embraces the captain and kisses him on the cheek to dissuade him. He also talks Hook into trying to persuade Peter's children, Jack and Maggie, to remain in Neverland permanently by using their father's repeated broken promises and prolonged absences as examples. Though Hook is successful with Jack, Maggie refuses to be swayed and retains her faith in Peter. Smee eventually abandons Hook when he realizes how much Peter loves his children. Near the end of the film, a man bearing a striking resemblance to Smee is seen sweeping garbage in Kensington Gardens, to Peter's surprise, but whether or not he is the real Smee is left unclear. =Peter Pan= Richard Briers portrays Smee in the 2003 live-action adaptation of Peter Pan with Jeremy Sumpter and Jason Isaacs =Neverland= Bob Hoskins reprises the role of Mr. Smee in the 2011 miniseries Neverland. =Once Upon a Time= Mr. Smee appears as William Smee in Once Upon a Time played by Chris Gauthier. William Smee is a man capable of procuring objects that are hard to find. In the Enchanted Forest, he makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin in order to get his life extended: a magic bean for his age reversal. Captain Hook, then the pirate Killian Jones, manages to intervene and kidnaps Mr. Smee to obtain the magic bean. He later becomes a crewman on Hook's ship (like the original Peter Pan story) as the ship sails off to Neverland where he and his crew will never age. In Neverland, Mr. Smee serves as an adviser to Hook, assisting in his murderous aspirations to kill Rumplestiltskin and his aspirations to obtain information and raise the newly arrived Baelfire. He worries of the crew being murdered by the Lost Boys who are searching for Baelfire whom the pirates had rescued from drowning. In Storybrooke, Mr. Smee appears as a homeless man who kidnaps Belle under the orders of Moe French (Maurice). When Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin) captures Mr. Smee to learn where Hook is, he states that he wasn't able to find Hook in Storybrooke. Mr. Gold later uses him as a guinea pig for a spell that would enable anyone to cross the border to Storybrooke without losing their memories again. When Hook does get to Storybrooke, Smee immediately begins following orders; he gives Hook Gold's most prized possession: Baelfire's shawl. In retaliation, Gold turns Mr. Smee into a rat. Following the Dark Curse's being undone, Mr. Smee was restored to human form as he was seen in the company of Hook and his pirates when they were robbing a stagecoach. However, he still has some side effects of being in rat form. Hook volunteers Smee to sail Henry to New York when Henry wants to run away from Storybroke to go home. =Pan= Smee appears in the film Pan, portrayed by Adeel Akhtar. His real name is Sam Smiegel shortened to Smee. References Bibliography * Barrie, J.M. (1904). Peter Pan * Barrie, J.M. (1911). Peter and Wendy * Hart, J.V. (2007). Capt.

He was recalled by Atlanta on August 18 and made his major league debut August 21 at Los Angeles, pitching the eighth inning. He did not allow a hit and fanned two. He earned first ML win on August 30 versus San Francisco with a scoreless ninth inning. He suffered his first MLB loss on September 9 against Philadelphia. He had filled in admirably in an injury depleted Atlanta Braves rotation in 2005, holding the Chicago Cubs to one run in seven innings on July 5. =Detroit Tigers= The Detroit Tigers acquired Colón from the Braves (along with Zach Miner) for Kyle Farnsworth at the July 31, , trade deadline. He spent most of his Tigers tenure in the bullpen before making two spot starts in September, and was shelved after that with stiffness in his throwing elbow. In , he appeared in 20 games for the Tigers. Colón started the season on the DL. During a rehab assignment in Triple-A Toledo, he was involved in an altercation with fellow pitcher Jordan Tata. During the course of the fight, Colón attempted to punch Tata and instead landed a punch to the face of Jason Karnuth, the Mud Hens closer who was trying to intercede and break up the fight. The resulting injury caused Karnuth to be admitted to the hospital and undergo plastic surgery to his face. According to his wife, who filed an assault report against Colón on her husband's behalf, Karnuth required a titanium plate to be screwed into his head. Karnuth missed most of the 2007 season as a result of the injuries. The Tigers suspended Colón for 7 days after the incident. On January 15, 2008, Colón pleaded no contest to an assault charge and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. =Kansas City Royals= Colón was traded to the Kansas City Royals on July 13, , for a player to be named later (minor league pitcher Daniel Christensen). He was outrighted to the minor leagues after the season and was invited to spring training in . He became a free agent after the 2008 season, but was re-signed by the Royals and invited to their 2009 spring training. He pitched in 48 Major League games with the Royals in 2009 and 2010, finishing 2–3 with a 4.83 ERA. =Kia Tigers= Colón signed with Kia Tigers of South Korea on May 5, 2010. He made 21 starts for the Tigers, finishing 8–7 with a 3.91 ERA. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 12, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, which included an invitation to spring training. He was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He appeared in 26 games with a 2–1 record and 5.02 ERA for the Isotopes. =Return to Kansas City= Colón signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals on January 25, 2012, and received an invitation to spring training. He was promoted to the Royals on June 14, 2012. On October 6, 2012 Colon elected free agency. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Colón signed a Minor League contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates in February 2013.http://www.piratesprospects.com/2013/02/pirates-add-two-minor-league- free-agents.html =Atlanta Braves= Colón was traded to the Atlanta Braves in April 2013.http://www.piratesprospects.com/2013/04/pirates-trade-roman- colon-to-the-braves.html He was released after 6 games. =Colorado Rockies= He signed with the Rockies in May. =Third Stint with Royals= On January 10, 2015 Colon signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals. Personal life He resides in the Dominican Republic with his wife Monica.

His popular hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s include \\"一場遊戲一場夢\\" (A Game A Dream) and \\"幾分傷心幾分痴\\" (Bits of Sadness, Bits of Craze), \\"是否我真的一無所有\\" (Do I Really Have Nothing?), \\"誰明浪子心\\" (Who Can Understand A Loner's Heart?), \\"忘了你 忘了我\\" (Forget You Forget Me), and \\"安妮\\" (Annie).  Life and career  Wang was born in British Hong Kong,Dave Wang interview on Be My Guest from TVB-1 on Channel 34 as the son of a former Shaw Brothers actor, Wang Hsieh. He moved to Taiwan when he was 17. Before landing his first record deal in 1988, Wang wrote songs for other singers under pen-names such as \\"Little Grass\\" and \\"Northern Wind\\". He worked as a Tae Kwon Do instructor, ice-skating coach, taxi-driver, delivery-man, waiter, bartender, and cook. He also spent three years in the Taiwanese military to obtain a Taiwan ID card, despite holding a Hong Kong British passport. His first marriage ended when his wife at the time left him while he was serving in the military. Wang released his Chinese debut album A Game A Dream (一場遊戲一場夢), which sold over 500,000-copies in December 1987, which was used as the theme song in the 1988 telemovie The Game They Call Sex. Another of his hits, \\"幾分傷心幾分痴\\" (Bits of Sadness, Bits of Craze), released in 1988, shares the melody and base music of \\"一場遊戲一場夢\\" (A Game A Dream) but sung in Cantonese with different lyrics. It was an insert song on Looking Back in Anger and the music video features Yin Szema. He found success in Hong Kong during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many of his songs were used as the theme songs of popular TVB series. He is one of the few artists from Taiwan to break into the Hong Kong market, with four years of chart-topping record sales. He is likewise successful in other markets such as Malaysia, Singapore and mainland China. Wang migrated to Canada in 1994, after his second marriage on 1 April 1993. He carried on releasing 2-Chinese albums a year until 1998. On 1 June 1996, It was moved to officially released a new Chinese album under a different label names Pony Canyon Taiwan, which ceased operations in Taiwan in late 1997 due to the Asian financial crisis. Altogether, he had released a total of five Mandarin albums in just a period of two years at Pony Canyon with notable hits like \\"I Love You (我愛你)\\". On 1 January 1999, Wang made a comeback in the Hong Kong music industry and signed a recording contract with Emperor Entertainment Group. On 1 January 2000, the album Giving was released with a few new songs as well as remixes of his older classics. Following the success of this album, Wang held a major charity concert in late February of the same year at Hong Kong Coliseum in Hong Kong. Two years later, he released his latest Cantonese album through called L'Amour et le Rêve (愛與夢). Around the same time, he participated in various movies including Jackie Chan's New Police Story (新警察故事). He performed his first Beijing concert on 26 November 2004crienglish.com.

On 1 January 2007, he released his latest Mandarin album Goodbye Madman (別了瘋子); like his previous Mandarin album Regaining Consciousness (甦醒), it was not heavily promoted. After his 10-year contract with EEG expired, Wang held his 'I am Back' Concert on 23 October 2009 at the Hong Kong Coliseum. He held a series of world tour concerts from August to November 2010 in Beijing, Singapore and Tianjin. He stated during a television interview in July 2010 that he would retire from the music industry after the tour.Singer Dave Wang announces retirement from showbiz, Channel News Asia, 21 July 2010. Retrieved 10 December 2011. He then clarified in September that it was only song-writing that he would be leaving, after the completion of the album he was working on, and that he will still continue to perform in concerts.\\"I, Dave Wang, have nothing to hide!\\", Channel News Asia, 28 September 2010. Retrieved 10 December 2011. On June 10, 2017, he announced he will eventually retire, saying his voice is no longer as good as it should be, as it was damaged due to an unknown offender that drugged him, affecting his voice many years ago. Musical style and output His music and lyrics can be described as being melancholy and haunting in a blend of rock ballads and blues, which is attributed to his impoverished and tough upbringing. Wang is also an established songwriter, having written many of his most popular songs but also covers songs by other artists, both from Asia and other continents.E.g. Chang Yu-sheng's \\"No Smoking Days\\"; Dan Hill's \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\" To date, he has recorded 26 studio albums in Mandarin and 11 in Cantonese. In addition, numerous compilations of his popular songs have been released.

In 1958, Air Defense Command planned to acquire 13 Q-32 centrals for several Air Divisions/Sectors. Background In 1956, ARDC sponsored \\"development of a transistorized, or solid-state, computer\\" by IBM and when announced in June 1958, the planned \\"SAGE Solid State Computer...was estimated to have a computing capability of seven times\\" the AN/FSQ-7. ADC's November 1958 plan to field—by April 1964—the 13 solid state AN/FSQ-7A was for each to network \\"a maximum of 20 long-range radar inputs [40 LRI telephone lines] and a maximum dimension of just over 1000 miles in both north-south and east-west directions.\\" \\"Low rate Teletype data\\" could be accepted on 32 telephone lines (e.g., from \\"Alert Network Number 1\\"). On 17 November 1958, CINCNORAD \\"decided to request the solid state computer and hardened facilities\\", and the remaining vacuum-tube AN/FSQ-8 centrals for combat centers were cancelled (one was retrofitted to function as an AN/FSQ-7). \\" AN/FSQ-32 computer would be\\"* used: :1. for \\"a combat center\\" (as with the vacuum-tube AN/FSQ-8), :2. to accept \\"radar and weapons connections\\" for weapons direction as with the AN/FSQ-7--e.g., for backup CIM-10 Bomarc guidance or manned interceptor GCI if above-ground Direction Center(s) could not function, and :3. for \\"air traffic control functions\\". \\"Air Defense and Air Traffic Control Integration\\" was planned for airways modernization after the USAF, CAA, and AMB agreed on August 22, 1958, to \\"collocate air route traffic control centers and air defense facilities\\" (e.g., jointly use some Air Route Surveillance Radars at SAGE radar stations). The May 22, 1959, agreement between the USAF, DoD, and FAA designated emplacement of ATC facilities \\"in the hardened structure of the nine U. S. SCC's\\", and SAGE Air Defense Sectors and FAA regions were to have coincident boundaries in a June 19, 1959, air defense plan used to create a new SAGE Implementation Schedule on July 1, 1959. On December 21, 1959, the Office of Defense Research and Engineering informed NORAD a stop order had been placed on AN/FSQ-32 production and in January 1960, the Office of the Secretary of Defense recommended the SCC program be cancelled. The AN/FSQ-32, as part of the SCC Program, was cancelled by March 18, 1960, and the SAGE Air Traffic Integration (SATIN) was similarly cancelled by the DoD.Missile Master Plan (described by Schaffel p. 260: \\"…the Defense Department to issue, on June 19, 1959, the Master Air Defense Plan. Key features of the plan included a reduction in BOMARC squadrons, cancellation of plans to upgrade the interceptor force, and a new austere SAGE program. In addition, funds were deleted for gap-filler and frequency-agility radars.21\\" and publicized as the \\"Missile Master\\" Plan Back-Up Interceptor Control eventually with smaller solid-state computers at above-ground SAGE radar stations was instead implemented for survivability. Planned deployment was for Ottawa, St Louis, San Antonio, Raleigh, Syracuse, Chicago, Spokane, Minot, Portland, Phoenix, Miami (above-ground), Albuquerque (above-ground), and Shreveport (above-ground). (During 1959 SAGE/FAA \\"boundary alignments\\", the total was reduced to 12.}}The 1959 plan retained AN/FSQ-32 deployments for the Albuquerque DC, Chicago SCC, Great Falls SCC, Ottawa SCC/DC, and San Antonio SCC/DC but redesignated 7 of the sector names for the deployments: 1958 plan Portland, Spokane, Minot, St Louis, Syracuse, Raleigh SCC/DC, Miami DC 1959 plan San Francisco SCC, Seattle SCC, Denver SCC/DC, Ft Knox (SCC/DC), Boston SCC, Atlanta SCC/DC, Montgomery DC and in effect, the Shreveport Q-32 (for a sector between the San Antonio and Miami/Montgomery sectors) was eliminated, reducing the planned AN/FSQ-32 deployments to 12.) Prototype The prototype of the AN/FSQ-32 was the largest transistor (solid state) computer ever made. Initial weight: , expanded (18 tape drives, 10 storage units): . * *Larger text, second half: search only for \\"weight 90 tons\\" (with quotes): ** The Q-32 prototype was installed at System Development Corporation (SDC) headquarters in Santa Monica, California, and SDC developed the prototype software using JOVIAL. The mainframe occupied nearly an entire floor of a large office building (refrigeration units were also in the building). The prototype used batch processing of the military data. =ARPA research= In the early 1960s, the AN/FSQ-32 prototype was taken over by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and remained in Santa Monica. This action set the stage for ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office. SDC's research included ways to permit the prototype to handle multiple batch tasks simultaneously (\\"time-sharing\\") and to simultaneously process data multiple geographically-separated computer users.Oral History interview with Jules I. Schwartz, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota. Schwartz worked for the Rand Corporation on time-sharing for the prototype. On April 23, 1963, Dr. J.C.R. Licklider, ARPA Director of Behavioral Sciences Command & Control Research, identified early challenges in establishing a time-sharing network of computers with the software of the era. An early remote user of the prototype was the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute. Time-sharing By June 1963 the Time-Sharing System (TSS) Model Zero was demonstrated after magnetic drums were added to the time- sharing. Each user was given a priority-based time slice, measured in milliseconds, when the user's program was written from the magnetic drums into much higher speed memory, processed, and then written back to the magnetic drums with any computational changes that had occurred. It was influenced by early experiments at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, and the CTSS project at MIT. Terminals included several Teletype Model 33 ASRs. Computer network After the SAGE Sector Warning Network for the 1st operational SAGE direction center used the 1st operational computer network (cf. the experimental networks for Bomarc test launches and SAGE compatibility tests), in October 1965 Lincoln Labs' used a TX-2 solid-state computer tied to the Q-32 prototype for the first telecommunication of time packets. =Description= The prototype was an IBM 4020 Military Computer that included a Central Processing Unit, memory, High-Speed Input/Output, Low-Speed Input/Output, and for both computer operations and maintenance, an Operations Console. The AN/FSQ-32 central would have included additional equipment such as display and console equipment for use by Air Defense Command, Army Air Defense Command, Federal Aviation Administration, and other personnel (e.g., at SCC/DCs, weapons direction consoles for dispatching/guiding manned interceptors, launching/guiding CIM-10 Bomarcs, and launching Nike surface-to-air missiles). Central Processing Unit The Instruction set used a fixed length of one word providing 24 bits for the operation and 24 bits for the address. The address consisted of 18 bits (3 bytes) for the memory address, with other bits used for the specification of index registers and indirect addressing. The operation field provided the operation code and a variety of modifiers. Some modifiers allowed instructions to operate only on specific bytes of a word or on specific bits of a byte without separate masking operations. Other modifiers allowed the single 48-bit ALU to operate on a pair of 24-bit operands to facilitate vector operations. CPU controls included sense switches to control various software functions, a run/halt switch, and a switch, amplifier, and speaker assembly, to provide audio feedback or even play music, by connecting one of four bits in the main accumulator which could then be toggled under software control at an appropriate rate to produce whatever tones one wanted. Memory Memory was addressed by words, which were 48 bits long. Each word was divided into eight 6-bit bytes. A 6-bit byte, as opposed to the 8-bit byte in common use today, was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time. The address space provided a maximum of 256K words. The prototype was equipped with 128k words (48 bits plus two parity bits) of memory that was oil and water cooled. Also considered as part of the memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were 4 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a plug panel, similar to the one used in IBM Unit-Record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in plug panels which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used as a primitive ROM. The memory had a cycle time of 2.5 microseconds, and the lack of memory management was a limitation in the computer. Input/Output High-Speed Input/Output provided interfaces to the Drum Memory system, which consisted of a control system, and two vertical drum memory devices. Each drum read and wrote 50 bits at a time in parallel so transferring data could be done quickly. The drums were organized as 17 fields with 8192 words per field for a total capacity of 139264 words. The motors that rotated the drums required 208 VAC at 45 Hz so a motor generator unit was required to change the frequency from 60 Hz. This added to the noise level in the computer room. The other connection to/from the HSIO was to the SACCS EDTCC, which then interfaced to the rest of the SACCS. Low-Speed Input/Output interfaced to several different devices: * Communications Multiplexor * Tape Controllers 1 and 2, connected to 16 IBM 729-V Tape Drives * Disk File Controller, which was a modified Tape Controller, connected to a Bryant Disk File, which had 25 disks that were 39\\" in diameter, 125 read/write heads that were hydraulically actuated, and had a total capacity of 26 megabytes * IBM 1401, which controlled data transfers from unit-record equipment: IBM 1402 Card Reader/Punch, IBM 1403 Line Printer, & 2 IBM 729-V Tape Drives * 2 IBM Selectric Typewriters, (I/O Typewriters) one of which was used for operational messages and the other for diagnostic messages and maintenance activities. Notes *The AN/FSQ-32 planned for the \\"Canadian\\" 35th Air Division (in the Ottawa Air Defense Sector) was to have the \\"DC program only\\", and the 3 centrals for Albuquerque, Miami, and Shreveport were planned for use only in Direction Centers (rather than Super Combat Centers or SCC/DCs).

Besides portraying the deceased title character of the comedy Weekend at Bernie's and its sequel, Weekend at Bernie's II, he has more than 140 acting credits to his name, with a career spanning more than 50 years. He is the co-founder of the now defunct acting school The Actors Arena in Austin, Texas. Early life and education Kiser was born on August 1, 1939 in Elmhurst, Illinois, and was raised in Omaha, Nebraska. He attended the University of Kansas, where he received a football scholarship. He graduated in 1962 with a degree in industrial engineering. A few years later, on the advice of a drama teacher, he made the decision to pursue acting full-time and moved to New York City in 1965. He moved to New York City after his decision to quit his engineering profession to pursue acting. He joined the Actors Studio and worked with Lee Strasberg. Career After college, Kiser returned to his hometown Omaha and worked as an engineer for three years while acting in amateur productions; more than 50 plays. Kiser's first two years in New York City included an array of small parts, ranging from theater to television to commercials. By 1967, Kiser gained significant recognition for his work, winning both an Obie Award and Theater World Award for Fortune and Men's Eyes. Becoming a life member of The Actors Studio, Kiser was a regular on several soap operas, The Secret Storm and The Doctors. In 1978, he starred on the short-lived sitcoms The Roller Girls, and Sugar Time!. It was during the 1970s and early 1980s that Kiser appeared in Three's Company, One Day At A Time, The Love Boat, Night Court, 227, Maude and The Golden Girls. One of his roles was on the TV drama Hill Street Blues, playing comedian Vic Hitler (\\"Vic the Narcoleptic Comic\\"). He was a cast member on the syndicated sketch comedy show Off the Wall and a part of the ensemble on Carol Burnett's Carol & Company, which aired in 1990. In the 1990s, he appeared on Walker, Texas Ranger, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (as H. G. Wells) and Will & Grace. His film appearances include Fast Charlie... the Moonbeam Rider (1979), Rich Kids (1979), Steel (1979), An Eye for an Eye (1981), Making Love (1982), Six Pack (1982), Starflight: The Plane That Couldn't Land (1983), Surf II (1984), From a Whisper to a Scream (1987) and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988). Kiser starred in Weekend at Bernie's (1989), in the title role of Bernie Lomax, the corrupt insurance executive who is dead for most of the film. Bernie's young employees, played by Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy, attempt to convince people that Bernie is still alive. He reprised the role in Weekend at Bernie's II (1993). Since 2012, several YouTube videos featuring \\"The Bernie Dance\\" generated more than 17 million views collectively by April 2016. Other film appearances include Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991), Into the Sun (1992), The Pledge (2011), and A Christmas Tree Miracle (2013). In the early 2010s, Kiser began work on The Accidental President, which led to his participation in the second season of Johnny Dynamo. That show was followed with Kiser's lead role in the feature The Body Sculptor as Dr. Jason Stone. The film was scheduled for completion and release in 2016. In 2013, Kiser moved to Austin, Texas where he founded an acting school, The Actors Arena, which closed in 2016. Instruction was open to students of all ages and experience levels, and served approximately 300 students during its three-year run. Personal life In 2013, Kiser moved to Austin, Texas.

The elevated station is a transfer point to the AirTrain people mover system at Garage G/BART station. The station opened for AirTrain service in February 2003, with BART service beginning that June. After several service changes between 2003 and 2020, the station is served by the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line and the SFO–Millbrae line at all operating hours. Station layout The station structure viewed from AirTrain San Francisco International Airport station is an elevated structure about wide and long. It is located on the northwest side of the group of terminals; the west half of the station is adjacent to Garage G, while its east end connects to the north end of the International Terminal. A stub-end terminal station, the BART level has three tracks served by two island platforms. An elevated wye and crossovers to the west of the station allow trains arriving from the north or south to use any track. The south track is used for all trains departing to the north; on nights and weekends, Millbrae- bound trains use the north track. The middle track was not used in regular service until; its platform edges were blocked off. The AirTrain station, located above the west half of the BART station, has a single island platform serving the two AirTrain guideways, plus a side platform serving the inner loop. A footbridge above the AirTrain level provides access from the parking garage. BART faregates are located in the AirTrain station, and at the east end of the station where it connects to the departures level of the International Terminal. =Wind Portal= Wind Portal in 2009 Wind Portal is a 2003 artwork by Sebastopol artist Ned Kahn on the surface of the cylindrical opening in the floor separating the BART station from AirTrain. Passengers transferring between the two rail services ride escalators or walk on stairs through the opening, which measures high with a radius. The artwork consists of 200,000 stainless steel disks, each in diameter and individually hung so they respond to air currents induced by train traffic. John King, urban art critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, praised it, saying it was \\"[m]esmerizing ... an ever-changing silver shimmer ... indefinable movements reacting to distant winds as well as the whoosh of trains. The experience is hard to predict; there's a sense of anticipation.\\" History The station under construction in 1999 SFO–Millbrae line train at the station in 2019 A BART extension to San Francisco International Airport was first proposed in 1970 - before the initial system even opened. In 1972, a \\"trace\\" - a concrete shell with space for a station - was built into the North Terminal (now Terminal 3) during its construction; it was blocked from use by later construction. Planning began in the early 1990s; after a great deal of political controversy over where the airport station would be located, construction began in 1997. The BART extension was constructed in concert with the International Terminal (which expanded the airport's capacity) and the AirTrain system (which connects the BART station to the other airport terminals). The AirTrain system opened on February 24, 2003. BART service to SFIA station began on June 22, 2003. The station was initially served by the Dublin/Pleasanton line, plus a shuttle service to Caltrain connections at Millbrae station. The shuttle service was discontinued on February 9, 2004. The Pittsburg/Bay Point line began serving SFIA station (as well as Millbrae on nights and weekends), with northbound trips on the Richmond line also serving SFIA station at peak hours. Peak-hour Richmond line service began serving the station in both directions on September 13, 2004. Within the first two weeks of service to SFIA station, ridership was 50% below the projected 6,500 passenger exits per day. BART service to stations in San Mateo County is funded by SamTrans, rather than county tax revenues. As ridership stayed below expectations, SamTrans had to pay a larger-than-planned operating subsidy to BART. On September 12, 2005, in order to lower these subsidies, BART reduced service so that only the Dublin/Pleasanton line served SFIA and Millbrae stations. SamTrans and BART reached an agreement in February 2007 in which SamTrans would transfer control and financial responsibility of the SFO/Millbrae extension to BART, in return for BART receiving additional fixed funding from SamTrans and other sources. On January 1, 2008, BART increased service to the San Mateo stations. SFIA became the terminus of the Pittsburg/Bay Point line at all times, and direct service between SFIA and Millbrae was discontinued. On September 14, 2009, the line was extended to Millbrae on nights and weekends, restoring direct service at those times. During its first decade of service, ridership remained well below initial projections. Ridership has continued to increase, reaching a peak of 6,788 weekday exits in fiscal year 2016. On February 11, 2019, SFO–Millbrae line service resumed on weekdays and Sundays, with cross-platform connections to the Antioch line (formerly the Pittsburg/Bay Point line) at SFIA station. The Antioch line continued to serve both SFIA and Millbrae on weeknights and Saturdays. On February 10, 2020, the SFO–Millbrae line began running during all BART operating hours, with the Antioch line terminating only at SFIA. In October 2019, the BART board approved development of technology for a proposed pilot program, under which BART and other public transit riders would have access to priority security screening lines at the airport.

In addition to instrumental compositions, some of Iran's symphonic pieces are based on the country's folk songs, and some are based on poetry of both classical and contemporary Iranian poets. History Khaleqi in 1949. Ali-Naqi Vaziri, one of the most prominent and influential musicians of the late Qajar and early Pahlavi periods, established a private music school in 1924, where he also created a school orchestra composed of his students, formed by a combination of the Iranian instrument of tar and some western instruments. Vaziri then founded an association named Music Club (), formed by a number of progressive-minded writers and scholars, where the school orchestra performed concerts that were conducted by himself. The Tehran Symphony Orchestra () was founded by Gholamhossein Minbashian in 1933. It was reformed by Parviz Mahmoud in 1946, and is currently the oldest and largest symphony orchestra in Iran. Later, Ruhollah Khaleqi, a student of Vaziri, established the Society for National Music () in 1949. He wrote his musical compositions within the parameters of classical Iranian modes, some of which involved Western triadic harmony. Many of Iran's folk songs have the potential of being adapted into major or minor tonalities, and therefore, a number of Iranian folk songs were arranged for orchestral accompaniment. Symphonische Dichtungen aus Persien (\\"Symphonic Poems from Persia\\"), a collection of Persian symphonic works, was performed by the German Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Iranian conductor Ali Rahbari in 1980. Loris Tjeknavorian, a celebrated Iranian Armenian composer and conductor, composed Rostam and Sohrab, an opera with Persian libretto that is based on the tragedy of Rostam and Sohrab from prominent medieval Persian poet Ferdowsi's epic poem Šāhnāme, in over two decades. It was first performed by the Tehran Symphony Orchestra at Tehran's Roudaki Hall in December 2003. List of composers The following are a number of Iranian composers of symphonic music. * Ahmad Pejman * Ali Rahbari * Alireza Mashayekhi * Alireza Motevaseli * André Hossein * Behzad Ranjbaran * Fouzieh Majd * Heshmat Sanjari * Hormoz Farhat * Hossein Alizâdeh * Hossein Dehlavi * Houshang Ostovar * Loris Tjeknavorian * Majid Entezami * Mohammad Reza Tafazzoli * Morteza Hannaneh * Nader Mashayekhi * Reza Vali * Samin Baghtcheban * Shahrdad Rouhani See also * Music of Iran * List of Iranian musicians References Category:Iranian music ","title":"Symphonic music in Iran"},{"id":"5645049","text":"Norman Thagard self-experimenting aboard the Space Shuttle. He conducted physiological experiments on personnel during the STS-7 mission. Self- experimentation refers to scientific experimentation in which the experimenter conducts the experiment on her- or himself. Often this means that the designer, operator, subject, analyst, and user or reporter of the experiment are all the same. Self-experimentation has a long and well-documented history in medicine which continues to the present. Some of these experiments have been very valuable and shed new and often unexpected insights into different areas of medicine. There are many motivations for self-experiment. These include the wish to get results quickly and avoid the need for a formal organisational structure, to take the ethical stance of taking the same risk as volunteers, or just a desire to do good for humanity. Other ethical issues include whether a researcher should self-experiment because another volunteer would not get the same benefit as the researcher will get, and the question of whether informed consent of a volunteer can truly be given by those outside a research program. A number of distinguished scientists have indulged in self- experimentation, including at least five Nobel laureates; in several cases, the prize was awarded for findings the self-experimentation made possible. Many experiments were dangerous; various people exposed themselves to pathogenic, toxic or radioactive materials. Some self-experimenters, like Jesse Lazear and Daniel Alcides Carrión, died in the course of their research. Notable examples of self-researchers occur in many fields; infectious disease (Jesse Lazear: yellow fever, Max von Pettenkofer: cholera), vaccine research and development (Daniel Zagury: AIDS, Tim Friede: Snakebite), cancer (Nicholas Senn, Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert), blood (Karl Landsteiner, William J. Harrington), and pharmacology (Albert Hofmann, and many many others). Research has not been limited to disease and drugs. John Stapp tested the limits of human deceleration, Humphry Davy breathed nitrous oxide, and Nicholas Senn pumped hydrogen into his gastrointestinal tract to test the utility of the method for diagnosing perforations. Definition There is no formal definition of what constitutes self-experimentation. A strict definition might limit it to cases where there is a single-subject experiment and the experimenter performs the procedure on himself. A looser definition might include cases where the experimenters put themselves amongst the volunteers for the experiment. According to S. C. Gandevia of the University of New South Wales, who was looking at the question from the perspective of ethics, it is only self-experiment if the would-be self-experimenter would be named as an author on any subsequent published paper. That is, the person who would receive the academic credit for the experiment must also be the subject of it. Motivations Dr. Herta Oberheuser being sentenced at Nuremberg There are many reasons experimenters decide to self-test, but amongst the most fundamental is the ethical principle that the experimenter should not subject the participants in the experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves. This idea was first codified in the Nuremberg CodeThe Nuremberg Code, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, accessed and archived, 20 December 2015 in 1947, which was a result of the trials of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments. Several of these doctors were hanged. Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part. The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Critics of self- experimenters point to other less savoury motivations such as simple self- aggrandisement. Some scientists have resorted to self-experiment to avoid the \\"red tape\\" of seeking permission from the relevant ethics committee of their institution. Werner Forssmann was so determined to proceed with his self- experiment that he continued with it even after permission had been denied. He was twice dismissed for this activity, but the importance of his work was eventually recognised in a Nobel Prize. Some researchers, apparently, even believe that self-experimentation is not permitted. However, this is not true, at least in the United States where the same rules apply regardless of who the subject of the experiment is. Self-experimentation is also criticised for the risk of over-enthusiastic researchers, eager to prove a point, not accurately noting the results. Against this it is argued by those supporting self- experiment that medically trained persons are in a better position to understand and record symptoms, and self-experiment is usually at the very early stage of a program before volunteers have been recruited. A wish to commit suicide is sometimes offered as a reason for self-experimentation. However, Lawrence K. Altman, author of Who Goes First?: The Story of Self- experimentation in Medicine, while acknowledging that this may sometimes occur, after extensive research could find only one verified case of attempted suicide by self-experimentation. This was Nobel Prize winner Élie Metchnikoff, who, in 1881, suffering from depression, injected himself with relapsing fever. This was his second suicide attempt, but according to his wife, Olga, he chose this method of death so that it would be of benefit to medicine. However, Metchnikoff survived and in 1892 also self-experimented with cholera, but this is not thought to have been a suicide attempt. Perhaps the noblest motivation is the simple altruistic desire to do something of benefit to humanity regardless of the risks. There most certainly are risks, as Jesse Lazear found to his cost when he died of yellow fever after deliberately infecting himself. Max von Pettenkofer, after ingesting cholera bacteria said: According to Ian Kerridge, professor of bioethics at the University of Sydney, the most common reason for undertaking self-experimentation is not so much anything noble, but rather \\"an insatiable scientific curiosity and a need to participate closely in their own research\\". Ethics As already mentioned, it is an ethical principle that the researcher should not inflict on volunteers anything that the researcher would not be willing to do to him- or herself, but the researcher is not always a suitable, or even possible, subject for the experiment. For instance, the researcher may be the wrong gender if the research is into hormone treatment for women, or may be too old, or too young. The ethical question for the researchers is would they agree to the experiment if they were in the same position as the volunteers? Another issue that can lead researchers not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from taking part in the experiment. It is an ethical principle that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave HIV antibodies in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier. This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance. The ethics of informed consent is relevant to self-experimentation. Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure that is going to take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand. The principle of informed consent was first enacted in the U.S. Army's research into Yellow fever in Cuba in 1901. However, there was no general or official guidance at this time.S. C. Gandevia, \\"Self-experimentation, ethics, and efficacy\\", Monash Bioethics Review (Ethics Committee Supplement), vol. 23, no. 4, 2005 That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code. This was further developed in the Declaration of Helsinki in 1964 by the World Medical Association which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines. Rosalyn Yalow at the Bronx VA Hospital in 1977 Some researchers believe that experimental research is too complex for the general public ever to be able to give proper informed consent. One such researcher is Eugene G. Laforet, who believes that the researchers taking part in the experiment themselves is more valuable to the volunteers than a legal consent form. Another is 1977 Nobel Prize winner Rosalyn S. Yalow who said \\"In our laboratory we always used ourselves because we are the only ones who can give truly informed consent.\\" On the other side of the coin, there is the possibility that members of a research team may be coerced into participating by peer pressure. The question of who should be first to try the procedure in a new experiment is an ethical one. However, according to Altman it is not a question that can successfully be legislated. A law requiring self-test would force researchers to take risks that may sometimes be inappropriate. A code forbidding it might inhibit valuable discoveries. Self-experimentation has a role in medical education. Although no longer encouraged, in former times it was perfectly standard to expect medical students to try for themselves the drugs they were going to be prescribing. Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, whose own self-experiments led him to the concept of what are now called hormones, was a nineteenth century proponent of the practice: Value Self-experimentation has value in rapidly obtaining the first results. In some cases, such as with Forssmann's experiments done in defiance of official permission, results may be obtained that would never otherwise have come to light. However, self-experiment lacks the statistical validity of a larger experiment. It is not possible to generalise from an experiment on a single person. For instance, a single successful blood transfusion does not indicate, as we now know from the work of Karl Landsteiner, that all such transfusions between any two random people will also be successful. Likewise, a single failure does not absolutely prove that a procedure is worthless. Psychological issues such as confirmation bias and the placebo effect are unavoidable in a single-person self-experiment where it is not possible to put scientific controls in place. Such concerns do not apply so much if the self-experimenter is just one of many volunteers (as long as the self-experimenter is not also responsible for recording the results) but his or her presence still has value. As noted above, this can reassure the other participants. It also acts as a check on the experimenter when considering whether the experiment is ethical or dangerous. Notable examples =Anaesthesia= Lidocaine, the first amino amide–type local anaesthetic, was first synthesized under the name xylocaine by Swedish chemist Nils Löfgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anaesthesia experiments on himself. =Asthma= Roger Altounyan developed the use of sodium cromoglycate as a remedy for asthma, based on khella, a traditional Middle Eastern remedy, with experiments on himself. = Blood =  ABO blood group system  Karl Landsteiner in Stockholm, 1930 Dr. Karl Landsteiner's discovery of the ABO blood group system in 1900 was based on an analysis of blood samples from six members of his laboratory staff, including himself. Thrombocytopenia In the Harrington–Hollingsworth experiment in 1950, William J. Harrington performed an exchange blood transfusion between himself and a thrombocytopenic patient, discovering the immune basis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and providing evidence for the existence of autoimmunity. =Cancer= In 1901, Nicholas Senn investigated whether cancer was contagious. He surgically inserted under his skin a piece of cancerous lymph node from a patient with cancer of the lip. After two weeks, the transplant started to fade and Senn concluded that cancer is not contagious.Arsen P. Fiks, Paul A. Buelow, Self- experimenters: Sources for Study, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 . Much earlier, in 1808, Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert injected himself with a discharge from breast cancer. The site of injection became inflamed, but did not develop cancer. Gerhard Domagk, in 1949, injected himself with sterilised extract of human cancer in an attempt to prove that immunisation against cancer was possible. = Infectious diseases and vaccines =  AIDS vaccine  Daniel Zagury, in 1986, was the first to test his proposed AIDS vaccine.Daniel Zagury, Régine Léonard, Michéle Fouchard, Brigitte Réveil, Jacky Bernard, Daniéle Ittelé, Albert Cattan, Lurhuma Zirimwabagabo, Mbayo Kalumbu, Wane Justin, Jean-Jacques Salaun & Bernard Goussard, \\"Immunization against AIDS in humans\\", Nature, vol. 326, pp. 249–250, 25 March 1987.Daniel Zagury, Jacky Bernard, Remi Cheynier, Isabelle Desportes, Regine Leonard, Michelle Fouchard, Brigitte Reveil, Daniele Ittele, Zirimwabagangabo Lurhuma, Kalumbu Mbayo, Justin Wane, Jean-Jacques Salaun, Bernard Goussard, Loic Dechazal, Arsene Burny, Peter Nara & Robert C Gallo, \\"A group specific anamnestic immune reaction against HIV-1 induced by a candidate vaccine against AIDS\\", Nature, vol. 332, pp. 728–731, 21 April 1988.  Bartonellosis  Daniel Alcides Carrión, in 1885, infected himself from the pus in the purple wart (verruga peruana) of a female patient. Carrión developed an acute form of bartonellosis now known as Carrion's disease or Oroya fever. This is a rare disease found only in Peru and certain other parts of South America. He kept detailed notes of his condition and succeeded in showing through this self-experiment that the chronic and acute forms were the same disease. He died from the disease after several weeks.Ciro Maguiña, Eloy E. Ordaya, \\"Bartonellosis: Carrion's disease and other Bartonella infections\\", p. 564, in, Alan J. Magill, Edward T. Ryan, David R. Hill, Tom Solomon, Hunter's Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Elsevier, 2013 . A student who had assisted Carrion in carrying out this work was arrested and charged with murder, but later released.Cutis, vol. 48, iss. 4–6, p. 339, 1991.  Cholera  Max von Pettenkofer Max von Pettenkofer, in October 1892, drank bouillon deliberately infected with a large dose of cholera bacteria. Pettenkofer was attempting to disprove the theory of Robert Koch that the disease was caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae alone. Pettenkofer also took bicarbonate of soda to counter a claim by Koch that stomach acid killed the bacteria. Pettenkofer escaped with mild symptoms and claimed success, but the modern view is that he did indeed have cholera, luckily just a mild case, and possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.  Dysentery  S.O. Levinson with H.J. Shaugnessy – and others between 1942 and 1947 – injected themselves with a vaccine against dysentery. The vaccine had previously been tested on mice, which had all died within minutes, and the effect on humans was completely unknown. The experimenters survived but suffered strong side effects.  Gastritis and peptic ulcers  = Helicobacter pylori = In 1984 a Western Australian scientist, Dr Barry Marshall, discovered the link between Helicobacter pylori (at that time known as Campylobacter pylori) and gastritis. This was based on a series of self-experiments that involved gastroscopy and biopsy, ingestion of H. pylori, regastroscopy and biopsy and subsequent treatment with tinidazole. His only option was self- experimentation: ethical measures forbade him from administering H. pylori to any other person. In 2005, Marshall and his long-time collaborator Robin Warren were awarded Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, \\"for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease\\". Marshall's experiment debunked the long-held belief of the medical profession that stress was the cause of gastritis. This cleared the way for the development of antibiotic treatments for gastritis and peptic ulcers and a new line of research into the likely role of H. pylori in stomach cancer.Lawrence K. Altman, Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine, University of California Press, 1987 . = Campylobacter jejuni = Marshall's investigation was preceded by David A. Robinson who, in 1980, ingested Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium found in cow's milk, to investigate whether gastritis could be caused by drinking milk infected with C. jejuni. Robinson became sick as a result. Robinson needed to do a human experiment because the alternative, testing on cows, was not viable as infected cows frequently do not become ill. Staphylococcus Gail Monroe Dack (1901–1976), a former president of the American Society for Microbiology,\\"List of ASM (formerly SAB) general meetings 1899–present\\", American Society for Microbiology, accessed and archived, 18 December 2015. gave himself food poisoning by eating cake tainted with Staphylococcus. Syphilis Constantin Levaditi (1874–1953) injected himself with spirochaete from rabbits suffering from syphilis but did not contract the disease himself. Yellow fever Jesse Lazear In Cuba, U.S. Army doctors from Walter Reed's research team infected themselves with yellow fever including James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte, and, most notably, Jesse Lazear, who died from yellow fever complications in 1900. These efforts ultimately resulted in proof of the mosquito-borne nature of yellow fever transmission and saved countless lives. Stubbins Ffirth had investigated the contagious nature of the disease at the end of the 18th century. There was an unsuccessful campaign to award a Nobel Prize to Reed's team. Lazear, in any event, could not be awarded the prize because it is never given posthumously. However, a Nobel Prize was awarded to a later yellow fever researcher and self-experimenter, Max Theiler who, in 1951, developed the first yellow fever vaccine and was the first to try it. Trachoma Anatolii Al'bertovich Shatkin, in 1961, injected trachoma virus into the conjunctival sac of his eye and rapidly developed trachoma. He did not begin treatment of the condition for 26 days. Schistosomiasis In July 1944, physician researcher Claude Barlow ingested over 200 schistosome worms to carry back to the United States from Egypt to study whether domestic snails could become infected and introduce the disease into the United States. Attempts to send infected snails, the intermediate host, by mail had been unsuccessful. He refused treatment, despite being desperately ill by December, so as not to lose the eggs for further study. He finally passed 4,630 eggs in his semen and 200 eggs in his urine. The U.S. government decided not to use the eggs, so his self-sacrifice was to no avail. It was November 1945 before he finally cleared all the parasites, after treatment with tartar emetic. = Non-infectious diseases =  Anaemia  William Bosworth Castle, in 1926, ate minced raw beef every morning, regurgitated it an hour later, and then fed it to his patients suffering from pernicious anaemia. Castle was testing his theory that there was an intrinsic factor produced in a normal stomach that hugely increased the uptake of the extrinsic factor (now identified as vitamin B12), lack of which leads to pernicious anaemia. Beef is a good source of B12, but patients did not respond with beef alone. Castle reasoned they lacked production of intrinsic factor and he could provide it from his own stomach. While Castle was not the recipient of this treatment, his story is included in Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine and is considered a self-experimenter by the author.Marshall A. Lichtman, Jerry L. Spivak, Hematology: Landmark Papers of the Twentieth Century, p. 564, Academic Press, 2000 .D. J. Lanska, \\"Castle, William\\", in Michael J. Aminoff, Robert B. Daroff (eds), Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, p. 608, Academic Press, 2014 . Hyperthyroidism Elliott Cutler (1888–1947) took sufficient thyroid extract to give himself hyperthyroidism and enable him to study the effect of the condition on kidney function. Scurvy In London in June 1769, William Stark aimed to find the cause of scurvy with a series of dietary experiments on himself. He devised a series of 24 dietary experiments and kept accurate measures of temperature and weather conditions, the weights of all food and water he consumed, and the weight of all daily excretions. He started with a basic diet of bread and water and became 'dull and listless'. When he recovered, he resumed experimenting by adding various foods, one at a time - olive oil, milk, roast goose, and others. After two months, he had symptoms of scurvy. By November 1769 he was living on nothing but honey puddings and Cheshire cheese. He considered testing fresh fruits and vegetables when he died in February 1770. = Drugs = Cocaine In 1936, Edwin Katskee took a very large dose of cocaine. He attempted to write notes on his office wall, but these became increasingly illegible as the experiment proceeded. Katskee was found dead the next morning.  Disulfiram  In 1945, during the German occupation of Denmark, Erik Jacobsen and Jens Hald at the Danish drug company Medicinalco (which had a group of enthusiastic self-experimenters that called itself the \\"Death Battalion\\") were exploring the possible use of disulfiram to treat intestinal parasites, and in the course of testing it on themselves, accidentally discovered its effects when alcohol is ingested, which led several years later to the drug called Antabuse. Furan Chauncey D. Leake, in 1930, took furan as a possible substitute for aspirin but it just gave him a splitting headache and painful urination that lasted three days. Grapefruit juice David G. Bailey, in 1989, was researching the effects of drinking alcohol while taking the then experimental drug felodipine. It was usual in this kind of research to mix the alcohol with orange juice but Bailey did not like the taste of this drink so used grapefruit juice instead. Bailey found that there was three times more felodipine in his, and fellow researchers', blood than had been reported by other scientists using orange juice. It was later found that grapefruit juice suppresses an enzyme responsible for breaking down a large number of different drugs.David G Bailey, J Malcolm, O Arnold, J David Spence, \\"Grapefruit juice–drug interactions\\", British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, vol. 46, iss. 2, pp. 101–110, August 1998. Ibuprofen As part of the team who developed ibuprofen in the 1960s, Stewart Adams initially tested it on a hangover. Psychoactive drugs Friedrich Sertürner isolated morphine from opium in 1804. Morphine was the first-ever alkaloid isolated from any plant. Sertürner wanted to prove his findings to his colleague with a public experiment on himself and three other friends.The high life of the self-experimenters New Scientist 12 August 2014. Jacques-Joseph Moreau published his study \\"Du Hachisch et de l'aliénation mentale\\" in 1845. He self-experimented with hashish and observed its varying effects on other people. Moreau insisted that researchers should self-experiment to gain understanding of the altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive substances. Psychopharmacologist Arthur Heffter isolated mescaline from the peyote cactus in 1897 and conducted experiments on its effects by comparing the effects of peyote and mescaline on himself. Albert Hofmann discovered the psychedelic properties of LSD in 1943 by accidentally absorbing it and later intentionally ingesting it to verify that the effects were caused by LSD. He was also the first to isolate psilocybin from psilocybin mushrooms and self-experimented with it to prove it to be the active principle of psilocybin mushroom's psychoactive effects. Psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin synthesized and experimented with a wide array of new phenethylamine and tryptamine drugs, discovering a range of previously unknown psychoactive drug effects. Timothy Leary took LSD and was a well-known proponent of the social use of the drug in the 1960s. = Gases = Hydrogen Nicholas Senn Around 1886, Nicholas Senn pumped nearly six litres of hydrogen through his anus. Senn used a rubber balloon holding four US gallons connected to a rubber tube inserted in the anus. An assistant sealed the tube by squeezing the anus against it. The hydrogen was inserted by squeezing the balloon while monitoring the pressure on a manometer. Senn had previously carried out this experiment on dogs to the point of rupturing the intestine.James E. Pilcher, \\"Senn on the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal perforation by the rectal insuffation of hydrogen\\", Annals of Surgery, vol. 8, iss. 3, pp. 190–204, September 1888. Senn was a pioneer of using this technique to determine if the bullet in gunshot wounds had penetrated the intestinal tract. In experiments on gunshot wounds to dogs, Senn verified that the gas escaping from the wound was hydrogen by setting light to it.Nicholas Senn, \\"Rectal insufflation of hydrogen gas: an infallible test in the diagnosis of visceral injury of the gastro-intestinal canal in penetrating wounds of the abdomen\\", The Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. 10, no. 25, pp. 767–777, June 23, 1888. Reports that Senn used helium in this experiment are almost certainly erroneous. Helium was first detected on Earth in 1882,Alfred Walter Stewart, Recent Advances in Physical and Inorganic Chemistry, p. 201, BiblioBazaar, 2008 . but not isolated until 1895,Clifford A. Hampel, The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements, Van Nostrand Reinhold, pp. 256–268, 1968 . and extractable reserves not found until 1903.John Emsley, Nature's Building Blocks, pp. 175–179, Oxford University Press, 2001 . Synthetic gases Humphry Davy self-experimented with breathing of several different gases, most notably nitrous oxide. = Genes = Self- experimentation with gene therapies have been reported.FDA warns public of dangers of DIY gene therapyVideo: Biohacker documents his own DIY gene therapyInformation About Self-Administration of Gene Therapy Every gene therapy has a unique risk of harm, including the risk associated with the gene delivery method (i.e., the particular viral vector or form of transfection) that is used and the risk associated with a specific genetic modification. Examples of potential risks for some gene therapies include tissue damage and an immune response to foreign DNA, among many others. = Pain = Thomas Lewis and Jonas Kellgren studied pain in the 1930s. To do this, they injected hypertonic saline into various parts of their own bodies. = Physical experiments = Hanging In the early 1900s Nicolae Minovici, a professor of forensic science in Bucharest, undertook a series of experiments into hanging. At first he put the noose around his neck while lying down and had an assistant put tension on the rope. He then moved on to full suspension by the neck. Finally, he attempted suspension with a slipping hangman's knot, but the pain was too great for him to continue. He could not swallow for a month. Minovici was determined to surpass a record set by Dr. Fleichmann of Erlangen, who in 1832, self-asphyxiated for two minutes.Fleichmann, tr. L. Paris, \\"Des différents genres de mort\\", Annales d'Hygiène Publique et de Médecine Légale, series 1, vol. 8, pp. 412–437, 1832. However, Minovici could not get close to this and disbelieved Fleichmann.Alex Boese, Electrified Sheep, Pan Macmillan, 2011 . Minovici and Fleichmann are not the only ones to self-experiment with strangulation. Graeme Hammond, a doctor in New York, tried it in 1882. Francis Bacon described an even earlier occasion in 1623 when the self-experimenter stepped off a stool with a rope around his neck, but was unable to regain his footing on the stool without assistance. Rapid acceleration Stapp being brought to a sudden stop in the rocket sled John Paul Stapp, in 1954, sat in a rocket sled fired along rails in a series of steadily more violent tests. Speeds reached 631 mph, almost the speed of sound. This is a speed record for a manned rail vehicle that still stands today. At the end of the track the sled hit a trough of waterSheryl L. Hutchison, Mentor Inbound: The Authorized Biography of Fred J. Ascani, Major General, Usaf Retired, p. 101, AuthorHouse, 2009 . that brought it to a rapid stop in around 1.4 seconds. In the most severe test, Stapp underwent an acceleration of 20 g as the rocket engine accelerated the vehicle up to speed and 46 g of deceleration (also a record) as the vehicle was brought to a stop. Stapp suffered numerous injuries in these tests (previous animal tests had shown that limbs could be broken merely by being pulled into the air stream), and several concussions. In the last test his eyes were bloodied as blood vessels burst in his eyes.James D. Livingston, Rising Force, p. 184, Harvard University Press, 2011 .George Bibel, Beyond the Black Box: The Forensics of Airplane Crashes, JHU Press, 2008 . These tests were carried out for the US Air Force to determine the forces that pilots could be subjected to and to enable better restraining straps to be designed. Weight balance Santorio Santorio spent a large portion of 30 years living on a platform meticulously measuring his daily weight combined with that of his intake and excretion in an effort to test Galen's theory that respiration occurs through the skin as perspiratio insensibilis (insensible perspiration). The result was the 1614 publication De Statica Medicina (\\"On Medical Measurements\\").Eknoyan G. Santorio Sanctorius (1561–1636) – founding father of metabolic balance studies. Am J Nephrol. 1999;19(2):226-33. = Poisons = Black widow spider venom Allan Blair of the University of Alabama, in 1933, deliberately caused a black widow spider to bite him. At the time there was some doubt that the reported symptoms of some victims were the result of a spider bite or some other cause. Blair's experiment was intended to settle the matter. Blair became seriously ill and was hospitalised for several days in great pain, but survived.Gordon Grice, \\"Black widow\\", The Red Hourglass: Lives of the Predator, Random House Publishing Group, 2009 . Hydrogen cyanide Joseph Barcroft Joseph Barcroft, in 1917, tested hydrogen cyanide on himself as part of research into poison gas in World War I. He was shut in a chamber with a dog and exposed to the gas. Barcroft continued with the experiment even after the dog went into tetanic convulsions and appeared to die. The experiment was continued for less than two minutes. The next morning the dog was found to be alive and apparently fully recovered. It is not known why dogs are more susceptible to the gas than humans.John B. West, Essays on the History of Respiratory Physiology, Springer, 2015 . *For other self- experiments by Barcroft, see Snake venom Tim Friede created his own vaccine against snakebite using pure venom injections from all four species of mambas, and four cobra species to achieve high immunity. He also survived anaphylactic shock six times during the development of his vaccine. Others have also injected venom to create immunity to snake venom: Bill Haast, Harold Mierkey, Ray Hunter, Joel La Rocque, Herschel Flowers, Martin Crimmins, and Charles Tanner.Kagen, S. and Muthiah, R. \\"Poisonous Snake Venom Anaphylaxis vaccination: A case report of a non-physician directed experiment\\". Annals of Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2004, volume 92, p. 72. Tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride In 1921, Maurice Crowther Hall ingested carbon tetrachloride to test its safety with a view to its possible use as a treatment for hookworm. Hall reported mild side effects. Carbon tetrachloride has since been found to cause acute liver failure.G. R. Cameron, W. A. E. Karunaratne, \\"Carbon tetrachloride cirrhosis in relation to liver regeneration\\", The Journal of Pathology, vol. 42, iss. 1, pp. 1–21, January 1936. In 1925, Hall ingested tetrachloroethylene (once the most common dry cleaning fluid) for the same purpose. =Radioactive materials and isotopes= Gary Earl Leinbach, in 1972, swallowed radioactive iodine and a knife in a tube for a biopsy. Leinbach was investigating a new way of diagnosing steatorrhea. Kenneth Gordon Scott, in 1949, inhaled aerosols of plutonium and uranium. Heavy water Klaus Hansen drank heavy water. = Surgical and psychological procedures = Cardiac catheterization Werner Forssmann Clinical application of cardiac catheterization began with Werner Forssmann in the 1930s, who inserted a catheter into the brachial vein of his own forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an X-ray picture of it. Forssmann did this procedure without permission. He obtained the assistance of a nurse by deceiving her that she was to be the subject of the experiment. He tied down her arms while inserting the catheter into his own arm, only releasing her at the point it was too late to change, and he needed her assistance.I. Kerridge, \\"Altruism or reckless curiosity? A brief history of self experimentation in medicine\\", Internal Medical Journal, vol. 24, iss. 2, pp. 43–48, 2005 Forssmann was twice fired for carrying out these self- experiments, but shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956 for this achievement. Cardiac catheterization is now a routine procedure in heart surgery. Self-surgery There have been several cases of surgeons operating on themselves, but most often it has been in the nature of an emergency rather than experiment. Such a case was Leonid Rogozov who was obliged to remove his own appendix in 1961 while stranded in Antarctica in winter.L.I. Rogozov, \\"Self-operation\\", Soviet Antarctic Expedition Information Bulletin, pp. 223–224, 1964. However, the first surgeon to carry out this self-operation, Evan O'Neill Kane in 1921, did so with an element of experiment. Although Kane's operation was necessary, it was not necessary to do it himself, so that in itself was experimental. More than that, Kane wished to experience the operation under local anaesthetic before trying the procedure on his patients. Kane advocated a reduction in the use of general anaesthetic by surgeons. Sensory deprivation John C. Lilly developed the first sensory deprivation tanks and self-experimented them with the intention to study the origin of consciousness and its relation to the brain by creating an environment which isolates an individual from external stimulation. Temperature and pressure Joseph Barcroft, in 1920, spent six days in a sealed glass chamber to investigate respiration at altitude. The partial pressure of oxygen was initially 163 mmHg falling to 84 mmHg (equivalent to an altitude of 18,000 ft) as the experiment progressed. Barcroft was attempting to disprove a theory of John Scott Haldane that the lungs actively secrete oxygen into the blood (rather than just through the process of passive diffusion) under conditions of low oxygen partial pressure. Barcroft suffered from severe hypoxia. At the end of experiment, part of Barcroft's left radial artery was removed for investigation. In 1931, Barcroft subjected himself to freezing temperatures while naked. Towards the end of the experiment he showed signs of the final stages of hypothermia. He was thought to be close to death and had to be rescued by colleagues. Neural implant Kevin Warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into the median nerve fibres of his left arm. With this in place, over a 3-month period, he conducted a number of experiments linking his nervous system with the internet.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:\\"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems\\", Archives of Neurology, 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003  Neural adaption to immobilization  Nico Dosenbach wore a pink cast over his (unbroken) right arm for two weeks in order to examine how brain circuits controlling movement are impacted by immobilizing illnesses or injuries. He did a 30-minute resting state fMRI study daily and identified an undiscovered pattern of pulses of rs-fMRI signal in motor regions controlling the disused anatomy.

While a TD, Herbert served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1973 to 1979, being appointed to Ireland's first delegation, second delegation and third delegation. In the first direct elections to the European Parliament in December 1979 he stood in the Munster constituency but was not elected. He played hurling as a full-back with the Limerick Senior Hurling team, with whom he won a National Hurling League medal in 1947, and also with his local club Ahane. He retired prematurely from the game following a serious head injury sustained in a club match in 1949. His brothers Seán Herbert and Tony Herbert were also hurlers with Limerick and his son Turlough Herbert was a member of the Limerick senior hurling panel for the 1994 All-Ireland final. Michael Herbert died in 2006, aged 81.

Coats. Models A corporation was formed and perhaps two prototypes were assembled. Five incrementally different designs were described. The first was by a \\"Norwegian engineer\\" and used two three-cylinder radial engines on the rear axle, one powering each wheel. The second was by James Yeikichi Sakuyama, for years an engine designer at Indianapolis, with a V-3 engine, gearbox and cast grid steam generator. It was quickly changed to a fire tube steam generator and inline-3 cylinder engine flat in the chassis. The fourth design took that Sakuyama chassis and engine and replaced the steam system in late 1923 with Charles A. French's patent design. The French-Coats was technically the most superior, probably the most likely to have been functional, and the car used in photographs. The fifth design was simply the chassis of Purdue professor Allen C. Staley, shown as a high grade Coats steam car at three shows. Business Plan The car price remained the same at $1085 throughout the promotion, and dealerships and distributorships were sold to finance the development and sales effort. Eventually Coats obtained the confidence of Y. F. Stewart who had manufacturing facilities. A pickle factory in Bowling Green, Ohio was obtained and a defunct coachbuilder's factory in Columbus, Ohio was purchased. The Cumberland tire company was shown in advertisements as a third factory, as they were to be the tire supplier. Outcomes All was gone by mid 1924 when the Columbus plant was sold. Coats went on to many enthusiastic promotions including road building equipment in 1924 in New Jersey and inadvertently became one of the creators of the syndicate which quickly became CBS. He stayed in radio promotion in New York City and was buried in the family cemetery in Indiana.

The only other consistent band member throughout this period was Joel Bogen, Willcox's principal co-writer and guitarist. Background  Back in the National Theatre, when she was 18, Toyah Willcox felt that was the right environment for her to work out how to put a band together: the theatre was full of musicians as well as actors. \\"Through a series of coincidences I just got involved in a punk band and that was purely from asking around y’know 'Has anybody got a band, does anyone need a singer?'\\" she remembered. First Toyah ended up in a punk band from Golders Green, which used to rehearse at Golders Green cemetery and even did a few gigs there. It was Glen Marks, though, who in 1976 introduced Toyah to a protege who was at his school called Joel Bogen, whom she described later as \\"a very accomplished musician\\", by far the most accomplished musician that she'd met at that time. With Joel she struck up a writing partnership. In the beginning they's only meet up on Sundays and write and answer ads from the NME. Then they got a keyboard player called Pete Bush who had a music room in his house in Totteridge where three of them could rehearse. Slowly the band came together \\"from friends of friends of friends\\".  The band Toyah  In June 1977, the band played their first gig without a name or a bass player. After several line-up changes, they spent a brief period under the name Ninth Illusion, without recording any music. In the beginning of 1978 they met again and the idea of Toyah the band was born. Joel auditioned several musicians and chose Pete Bush (keyboards), Dave Robin (drums), and Windy Miller (bass), quartet quickly taking their name from their unusual vocalist and figurehead. Toyah debuted in Barnet's, Duke Of Lancaster on 27 June, and gave three more concerts in London. On 13 July the band performed at Young Vic Festival.Various press clippings, June 1978 – 1980. – www.toyah.net. The band began to record early demos in Willcox's converted warehouse called Mayhem – which comprised offices, recording and rehearsal rooms for many young bands on the London scene of the time. Early demos recorded during 1978 included songs called \\"Mother\\", \\"Hunger Hill\\", \\"Eyes\\", \\"Computers\\", \\"Gaoler\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Danced\\", \\"Neon Womb\\", \\"Problem Child\\", \\"Little Boy\\" and \\"Israel\\", several of which would make it onto the band's early releases, and several others would emerge on the later rarities compilation Mayhem in 1985. And then the contract came. In 1980 she remembered: In July 1979, Safari released the band's debut single \\"Victims of the Riddle\\", described by the NME as \\"a remarkably listenable slice of paranoia and macabre\\". It featured alongside Toyah Willcox, Joel Bogen and Peter Bush, Mark Henry (bass guitar) and Steve Bray (drums).Taylor, Steve. Toyah. Riverside Studios, London. NME. July 1979. \\"Once we were signed I really loved every moment of what happened. We were making a demo virtually once a month, we had to continually produce music, and that was great, because it gave the band focus, it made us feel really good, it put on a retainer 30 quid a week so we felt as if we were employed…\\", Toyah remembered. The band's next release was an extended 33⅓rpm EP marketed as an \\"Alternate Play\\" record by their label Safari Records, entitled Sheep Farming In Barnet, which came out in August 1979 as a six track EP and a full album. The band followed this up with another non-album single, \\"Bird in Flight / Tribal Look\\", and their full-length album The Blue Meaning (1980) (No. 40 UK Albums Chart) which one reviewer described as \\"Patti Smith on speed\\", another – as \\"Patti Smith off speed\\". =Commercial success= Following Willcox's appearance as punk musician Toola in an episode of the UK TV series Shoestring, ATVATV was a division of ITV filmed the band during this period, both off-stage and on. The result was a hit documentary watched by 10 million viewers, propelling Toyah into the mainstream, and the live album Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! (1980). By this time it became clear that Toyah, rather than her band members, was getting the attention from the press. \\"I can't help it if I have so much charisma I wipe four blokes off the stage – I don't believe that's true. If people prefer watching me it's not through my doing. I’d say, all due respect to the band – I work harder than any of them and it's up to them to keep up with me if they want as much publicity as I get\\", she argued in 1980. \\"When anything went wrong with the band a particular member would say it was because Toyah was acting. Which was a load of crap. So the band would go out, make mistakes, not rehearse enough, lose money, and they'd blame it on me because I was away acting. They couldn't live without me. They were totally dependent on me, so that overworked me. I was having to mother them the whole time. Which was ridiculous. They were like a bunch of old women, continually having periods as far as I was concerned\\", she told Paul Morley, adding that the group resented the attention she was getting, her tendency to want to write the music, the time she was away pursuing a role that created her image and diminished theirs.  The line-up change  In 1981, the line-up changed, with only Willcox and Bogen remaining for the band's next set of releases. They were joined by Phil Spalding on bass, Nigel Glockler on drums and Adrian Lee on keyboards, and released the hit EP \\"Four from Toyah\\", the lead-track from which is a cover called \\"It's a Mystery\\" – originally recorded by Sheep Farming's producer Keith Hale and his band Blood Donor. \\"When I first heard 'It's a Mystery' I thought it wasn't for me. It was written by a friend called Keith Hale for a band called Blood Donor and the record company wanted me to cover it…\\" Toyah remembered. She hated it, thinking it was the end of her career, \\"of four brilliant years' work as a credible rock artist... Because I'd worked from 1977 right up to 1980 and I had an army of followers and I just knew this song wasn't for them\\", she added. But the song proved to be a major success, and subsequent promotion pushed the EP to No. 4 in the UK singles charts. The album it was taken from, entitled Anthem (1981), reached No. 2 that same year, and also featured the hit \\"I Want to Be Free\\", which charted highly in the UK (No. 8), Ireland (No. 10) and South Africa (No. 10). \\"It was resonated with how I felt about my school years which was very strong even if I was only 22\\", Toyah said later. The singer felt \\"We Are\\" might have been released as a single too. \\"I think history would have been re-written and we would have played Wembley in 1982 instead of Hammersmith for two nights. This was discussed between Safari and the promoters, that I could have been the first female artist to play Wembley Arena, but everyone played safe. Back then there would have been an audience backlash if we released three songs off the same album, we'd have been accused of ripping the fans off, it just wasn't done\\", she said in 2011. A non-album single, \\"Thunder in the Mountains\\", also hit the No. 4 spot. \\"In 'Thunder in the Mountains' I wanted to be Bodicea, set in the future, a woman breaking free… everything I did that year was on the concept of breaking free\\", Toyah commented later. The Four More from Toyah EP followed, with its lead track \\"Good Morning Universe\\". This introduced Simon Phillips on drums, who had replaced Nigel Glockler (who had left to join Saxon). \\"Simon Phillips joining the band certainly changed me and Joel, he was so totally bloody awesome. He raised the bar and gave the band huge credibility\\", Toyah later remarked. Both Phillips and Phil Spalding later were quoted to mention their time with the band Toyah as being a turning point for them as musicians. \\"We were a great band. We had a kind of ESP on stage. For many musicians, they are told what they can and can't play and above all must never shine above the lead singer. With me I want a solid team where all the members are unique and I think this is why Phil and Simon enjoyed the experience\\", Toyah said. Now seeing Adrian Lee's keyboard duties taken over by newcomer Simon Darlow and Joel Bogen, the band recorded a much darker gothic album entitled The Changeling (1982). The album, made at the times Toyah described as being the hardest for her, was still a success, as was lead single \\"Brave New World\\", but neither reached the heights of their predecessors, and a follow-up single announced as \\"Dawn Chorus\\" never materialised – a new track, \\"Be Proud Be Loud (Be Heard)\\" emerging instead. The album was followed by a tour, captured on the double live album Warrior Rock: Toyah on Tour (1982). Split The final Toyah album, Love Is the Law, followed in 1983, and again saw another line-up change, with only Willcox, Bogen and Darlow remaining. Phillips had been replaced by Andy Duncan, and Spalding shared bass duties with Brad Lang: both Phillips and Spalding had moved on to work with Mike Oldfield. Singles from the album failed to chart highly with the band's final single, \\"The Vow\\" (1983), peaking at No. 50\\\\. Willcox and Bogen parted ways the following year – the pair writing several songs which never reached the recording studio, and Bogen co- writing one song for Toyah's debut solo album Minx in 1985. Toyah herself had left Safari at this point, after being signed to CBS offshoot Portrait as a solo artist. Safari released the rarities compilation Mayhem (1985) – featuring demos and unreleased songs – however, this was done without Toyah's consent or knowledge – she found out about the album by spotting it on import in a record store in America. The Mayhem compilation issued by Safari in 1985, was an un-authorised release. \\"Of all the albums I wish had not been released 'Mayhem' is the one. It's sub standard, with songs not intended for release. In fact it makes my blood boil when I think of the plain exploitation of this album, but hopefully it never sold many copies. The songs on it were rehearsal demos, never intended for anything other than workshopping ideas\\", Toyah said later. Nigel Glockler joined Saxon where he stayed for many years. Simon Phillips was already a session musician when he joined Toyah and remains so. Phil Spalding became a session bassist and played bass with GTR. Toyah Willcox started the successful solo career. Her first album Minx (1985) was more a pop-oriented than her previous works; later she took a more experimental approach (Prostitute), collaborating on several records with her husband, Robert Fripp, and in 2000s returned to her late-1970s roots (Velvet Lined Shell, In the Court of the Crimson Queen). There were discussions regarding a Toyah band reunion in the late 1990s-early 2000s, but the project never got off the ground.

Many researchers have found the evolution of the eye attractive to study, because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms. Simple light detection is found in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants and animals. Complex, image-forming eyes have evolved independently several times.\\"\\"An important cue for understanding eye evolution is the distinction between different types of photoreceptor cells. Salvini-Plawen and Mayr ( 1977 ) noted a remarkable diversity of photoreceptor cell morphology across the animal kingdom, and suggested that photoreceptors evolved independently numerous times.\\" – Land, M.F. and Nilsson, D.-E., Animal Eyes(2-nd ed.), Oxford University Press, Oxford (2012), p. 7. The earliest known fossil of complex eyes date from the Ediacaran, with the appearance of the stem mollusk Clementechiton sonorensis. Diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale. Eyes vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in low light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours.  History of research  iris In 1802, philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of \\"design\\". Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species, that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance \\"absurd in the highest possible degree\\". However, he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it, its evolution was perfectly feasible: > ...if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and > perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as > is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be > inherited, as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should > be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the > difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by > natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be > considered as subversive of the theory.Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin > of Species. London: John Murray. He suggested a stepwise evolution from \\"an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism\\" to \\"a moderately high stage of perfection\\", and gave examples of existing intermediate steps. Current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution. Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors. Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classic paper that only a few hundred thousand generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates. Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through. All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory. Rate of evolution The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the Ediacaran period (about ). The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the \\"Cambrian explosion\\". One of the many hypotheses for \\"causes\\" of the Cambrian explosion is the \\"Light Switch\\" theory of Andrew Parker: it holds that the evolution of advanced eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution. Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision. The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate, because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells can evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye would still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.David Berlinski, an intelligent design proponent, questioned the basis of the calculations, and the author of the original paper refuted Berlinski's criticism. \\"Evolution of the Eye\\" on PBS One origin or many? Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion. Higher-level similarities – such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses – reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye. A shared trait common to all light-sensitive organs are opsins. Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals. Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses to mice and fruit flies. Such high- level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development. Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information- processing organ (brain) before there is information to process. A living example are cubozoan jellyfish that possess eyes comparable to vertebrate and cephalopod camera eyes despite lacking a brain. Stages of eye evolution The stigma (2) of the euglena hides a light-sensitive spot. The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called \\"eyespots\\". Eyespots can sense only ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena's eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end. It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis, and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms. Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation. Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. However, how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely: eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules. At a cellular level, there appear to be two main \\"designs\\" of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms). The functional unit of the eye is the photoreceptor cell, which contains the opsin proteins and responds to light by initiating a nerve impulse. The light sensitive opsins are borne on a hairy layer, to maximise the surface area. The nature of these \\"hairs\\" differs, with two basic forms underlying photoreceptor structure: microvilli and cilia. In the eyes of protostomes, they are microvilli: extensions or protrusions of the cellular membrane. But in the eyes of deuterostomes, they are derived from cilia, which are separate structures. However, outside the eyes an organism may use the other type of photoreceptor cells, for instance the clamworm Platynereis dumerilii uses microvilliar cells in the eyes but has additionally deep brain ciliary photoreceptor cells. The actual derivation may be more complicated, as some microvilli contain traces of cilia – but other observations appear to support a fundamental difference between protostomes and deuterostomes. These considerations centre on the response of the cells to light – some use sodium to cause the electric signal that will form a nerve impulse, and others use potassium; further, protostomes on the whole construct a signal by allowing more sodium to pass through their cell walls, whereas deuterostomes allow less through. This suggests that when the two lineages diverged in the Precambrian, they had only very primitive light receptors, which developed into more complex eyes independently. =Early eyes= The basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein bound to a chromophore, the pigment that absorbs light. Groups of such cells are termed \\"eyespots\\", and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings. Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phylaThe precise number varies from author to author. possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species. The planarian has \\"cup\\" eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction. These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup, which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions, then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened. While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light, as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo-sensitive cells regardless of its direction, the \\"cup\\" shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light's angle. Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails, and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria. Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup-shaped, heavily pigmented retina cells, which shield the light- sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light. However, this proto-eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction; this gradually changes as the eye's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows, allowing for increasingly precise visual information.Eye-Evolution? When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore, a chemical reaction causes the photon's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed, in higher animals, to the nervous system. These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina, a thin layer of cells that relays visual information,Fernald, Russell D. (2001). The Evolution of Eyes: How Do Eyes Capture Photons? Karger Gazette 64: \\"The Eye in Focus\\". including the light and day-length information needed by the circadian rhythm system, to the brain. However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema (Cladonematidae), have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain. During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction.Conway-Morris, S. (1998). The Crucible of Creation. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The primitive nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera. After the photosensitive cell region invaginated, there came a point when reducing the width of the light opening became more efficient at increasing visual resolution than continued deepening of the cup. By reducing the size of the opening, organisms achieved true imaging, allowing for fine directional sensing and even some shape-sensing. Eyes of this nature are currently found in the nautilus. Lacking a cornea or lens, they provide poor resolution and dim imaging, but are still, for the purpose of vision, a major improvement over the early eyepatches.Dawkins, Richard (1986). The Blind Watchmaker. Overgrowths of transparent cells prevented contamination and parasitic infestation. The chamber contents, now segregated, could slowly specialize into a transparent humour, for optimizations such as colour filtering, higher refractive index, blocking of ultraviolet radiation, or the ability to operate in and out of water. The layer may, in certain classes, be related to the moulting of the organism's shell or skin. An example of this can be observed in Onychophorans where the cuticula of the shell continues to the cornea. The cornea is composed of either one or two cuticular layers depending on how recently the animal has moulted. Along with the lens and two humors, the cornea is responsible for converging light and aiding the focusing of it on the back of the retina. The cornea protects the eyeball while at the same time accounting for approximately 2/3 of the eye's total refractive power.Ali, M.A. and M. A. Klyne. 1985. Vision in vertebrates. New York: Plenum Press It is likely that a key reason eyes specialize in detecting a specific, narrow range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum—the visible spectrum—is because the earliest species to develop photosensitivity were aquatic, and water filters out electromagnetic radiation except for a range of wavelengths, the shorter of which we refer to as blue, through to longer wavelengths we identify as red. This same light-filtering property of water also influenced the photosensitivity of plants.Fernald, Russell D. (2001). The Evolution of Eyes: Why Do We See What We See? Karger Gazette 64: \\"The Eye in Focus\\".Fernald, Russell D. (1998). Aquatic Adaptations in Fish Eyes. New York, Springer. = Lens formation and diversification = lens In a lensless eye, the light emanating from a distant point hits the back of the eye with about the same size as the eye's aperture. With the addition of a lens this incoming light is concentrated on a smaller surface area, without reducing the overall intensity of the stimulus. The focal length of an early lobopod with lens- containing simple eyes focused the image behind the retina, so while no part of the image could be brought into focus, the intensity of light allowed the organism to see in deeper (and therefore darker) waters. A subsequent increase of the lens's refractive index probably resulted in an in-focus image being formed. The development of the lens in camera-type eyes probably followed a different trajectory. The transparent cells over a pinhole eye's aperture split into two layers, with liquid in between. The liquid originally served as a circulatory fluid for oxygen, nutrients, wastes, and immune functions, allowing greater total thickness and higher mechanical protection. In addition, multiple interfaces between solids and liquids increase optical power, allowing wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution. Again, the division of layers may have originated with the shedding of skin; intracellular fluid may infill naturally depending on layer depth. Note that this optical layout has not been found, nor is it expected to be found. Fossilization rarely preserves soft tissues, and even if it did, the new humour would almost certainly close as the remains desiccated, or as sediment overburden forced the layers together, making the fossilized eye resemble the previous layout. Compound eye of Antarctic krill Vertebrate lenses are composed of adapted epithelial cells which have high concentrations of the protein crystallin. These crystallins belong to two major families, the α-crystallins and the βγ-crystallins. Both categories of proteins were originally used for other functions in organisms, but eventually adapted for vision in animal eyes. In the embryo, the lens is living tissue, but the cellular machinery is not transparent so must be removed before the organism can see. Removing the machinery means the lens is composed of dead cells, packed with crystallins. These crystallins are special because they have the unique characteristics required for transparency and function in the lens such as tight packing, resistance to crystallization, and extreme longevity, as they must survive for the entirety of the organism's life. The refractive index gradient which makes the lens useful is caused by the radial shift in crystallin concentration in different parts of the lens, rather than by the specific type of protein: it is not the presence of crystallin, but the relative distribution of it, that renders the lens useful.Fernald, Russell D. (2001). The Evolution of Eyes: Where Do Lenses Come From? Karger Gazette 64: \\"The Eye in Focus\\". It is biologically difficult to maintain a transparent layer of cells. Deposition of transparent, nonliving, material eased the need for nutrient supply and waste removal. Trilobites used calcite, a mineral which today is known to be used for vision only in a single species of brittle star.Burgess, Daniel S. (2001). Brittle Star Features Calcite Lenses, Photonics Spectra In other compound eyes and camera eyes, the material is crystallin. A gap between tissue layers naturally forms a biconvex shape, which is optically and mechanically ideal for substances of normal refractive index. A biconvex lens confers not only optical resolution, but aperture and low-light ability, as resolution is now decoupled from hole size – which slowly increases again, free from the circulatory constraints. Independently, a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer may split forward from the lens: a separate cornea and iris. (These may happen before or after crystal deposition, or not at all.) Separation of the forward layer again forms a humour, the aqueous humour. This increases refractive power and again eases circulatory problems. Formation of a nontransparent ring allows more blood vessels, more circulation, and larger eye sizes. This flap around the perimeter of the lens also masks optical imperfections, which are more common at lens edges. The need to mask lens imperfections gradually increases with lens curvature and power, overall lens and eye size, and the resolution and aperture needs of the organism, driven by hunting or survival requirements. This type is now functionally identical to the eye of most vertebrates, including humans. Indeed, \\"the basic pattern of all vertebrate eyes is similar.\\" =Other developments= Color vision Five classes of visual opsins are found in vertebrates. All but one of these developed prior to the divergence of Cyclostomata and fish. The five opsin classes are variously adapted depending on the light spectrum encountered. As light travels through water, longer wavelengths, such as reds and yellows, are absorbed more quickly than the shorter wavelengths of the greens and blues. This creates a gradient of light as the depth of water increases. The visual opsins in fish are more sensitive to the range of light in their habitat and depth. However, land environments do not vary in wavelength composition, so that the opsin sensitivities among land vertebrates does not vary much. This directly contributes to the significant presence of communication colors. Color vision gives distinct selective advantages, such as better recognition of predators, food, and mates. Indeed, it is thought that simple sensory-neural mechanisms may selectively control general behavior patterns, such as escape, foraging, and hiding. Many examples of wavelength-specific behaviors have been identified, in two primary groups: Below 450 nm, associated with direct light, and above 450 nm, associated with reflected light. As opsin molecules were tuned to detect different wavelengths of light, at some point color vision developed when the photoreceptor cells used differently tuned opsins. This may have happened at any of the early stages of the eye's evolution, and may have disappeared and reevolved as organisms became predator or prey. Similarly, night and day vision emerged when photoreceptor cells differentiated into rods and cones, respectively. Polarization vision Polarization is the organization of disordered light into linear arrangements, which occurs when light passes through slit like filters, as well as when passing into a new medium. Sensitivity to polarized light is especially useful for organisms whose habitats are located more than a few meters under water. In this environment, color vision is less dependable, and therefore a weaker selective factor. While most photoreceptors have the ability to distinguish partially polarized light, terrestrial vertebrates' membranes are orientated perpendicularly, such that they are insensitive to polarized light. However, some fish can discern polarized light, demonstrating that they possess some linear photoreceptors. Additionally, cuttlefish are capable of perceiving the polarization of light with high visual fidelity, although they appear to lack any significant capacity for color differentiation. Like color vision, sensitivity to polarization can aid in an organism's ability to differentiate surrounding objects and individuals. Because of the marginal reflective interference of polarized light, it is often used for orientation and navigation, as well as distinguishing concealed objects, such as disguised prey. Focusing mechanism By utilizing the iris sphincter muscle, some species move the lens back and forth, some stretch the lens flatter. Another mechanism regulates focusing chemically and independently of these two, by controlling growth of the eye and maintaining focal length. In addition, the pupil shape can be used to predict the focal system being utilized. A slit pupil can indicate the common multifocal system, while a circular pupil usually specifies a monofocal system. When using a circular form, the pupil will constrict under bright light, increasing the focal length, and will dilate when dark in order to decrease the depth of focus. Note that a focusing method is not a requirement. As photographers know, focal errors increase as aperture increases. Thus, countless organisms with small eyes are active in direct sunlight and survive with no focus mechanism at all. As a species grows larger, or transitions to dimmer environments, a means of focusing need only appear gradually. Placement Predators generally have eyes on the front of their heads for better depth perception to focus on prey. Prey animals' eyes tend to be on the side of the head giving a wide field of view to detect predators from any direction. Flatfish are predators which lie on their side on the bottom, and have eyes placed asymmetrically on the same side of the head. A transitional fossil from the common symmetric position is Amphistium.

He was a professor of linguistics, who mainly worked on the Lithuanian language. He was born at Pažiegė, near Dusetos, then part of the Russian Empire. Appointed as personal secretary to Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras Jaunius he showed great interest in the subject, and during the period 1905-12 studied at Saint Petersburg State University. After that, he continued his work on Indo-European language under the supervision of Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay. He later moved to Köningsberg to continue his studies under the direction of Adalbert Bezzenberger. In 1914 he received a master's degree in linguistics. Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian, initiated by Būga His research of Lithuanian personal names led him into the study of place-names. From these he was able to determine that the homeland of the Lithuanians and other Baltic peoples up to the 6th to 9th centuries CE had been just north of Ukraine in the area around the Pripyat River. In addition, he studied the chronological sequence of Slavic loanwords in the Baltic languages. He also carried out a linguistic reconstruction of the names of the early princes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and refuted the theories of their Slavic origin. This became the main thrust for the concept of the Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian (Didysis Lietuvių Kalbos Žodynas) in Lithuanian. He died in Königsberg, and was buried at Petrašiūnai Cemetery in Kaunas.

(ADK) and published by SNK. The English game title uses the same initials as the developer.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The game's major innovation is the ability of fighters to move virtually continuously towards or away from the screen as well as left and right in a similar manner to some 1980s arcade fighting games like Taito's Violence Fight, SNK's Street Smart and Atari's Pit-Fighter. Because of this, unlike many other 2D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, and does not use the \\"D\\" button, unlike many SNK fighting games. Only two action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick); instead, grappling and grabbing opponents is the focus of the gameplay: opponents can counter being grabbed and break free as well. Also featured is weapon play (another mechanic akin to beat 'em ups). Weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special and standard attacks. Weapons are thrown into the ring by spectators in the background. The health bar has several layers of colors to indicate the health. There is also a \\"Crazy Meter\\" at the bottom of the screen. It is built up as characters attack; this gives the character a special attack that will defeat the opponent outright. It is called the \\"Gan Gan Attack\\" in Japan, and \\"Crazy Attack\\" internationally. Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters. The dialogue differs from opponent to opponent, and the fight is immediately presaged by a clash of two small images of the combatants' eyes in the center of the screen. There are almost no differences between the Japanese release of this game and the international versions aside from the name, and the removal of blood when using a critical hit on an opponent. Characters The game features eight selectable characters. The characters are not named anywhere during gameplay, which is unusual for the genre. Seven of the characters are new to the series, but Kotaro Fūma returns from World Heroes. * - Also known as the \\"Red Panther of Honmoku\\", he is the protagonist of the story. Joe is the most powerful and famous brawler of the eastern area of Japan known as Kantō. Bored from the lack of good opponents in his area, he hears rumors about strong fighters to the west, so he travels there to confront them. Apart from this game, he makes a cameo appearance in one of Kisarah's attacks in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum. * - Also known as the \\"Naive Tomboy\\". She is an English school girl who has a reputation for being a femme fatale in Japanese schools. However, Kisarah falls in love with Joe Kusanagi and chases him to coerce Joe into being her boyfriend. She is the only female fighter in this game. Kisarah appears as a selectable character in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum and as an SNK character card in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS. * - Also known as the \\"Strong Spirit from Naniwa\\". Goh is the most famous brawler in the western area of Japan known as Kansai, and has his own gang. Goh got the news about the arrival of the \\"Red Panther from Honmoku\\" and is awaiting a fight against this new menace in order to further his goal of nationwide conquest. * - Also known as the \\"Angry Hurricane\\". His involvement in the story happens because that he got lost during one of his travels through time and landed in 1994 Japan, where the game takes place, and became involved in the ensuing fights. Like the rest of characters in the game, Fūma does not have powers (only his \\"Enryūha\\" signature move make the transition from World Heroes), but in exchange, he gains many combo moves. * - Also known as the \\"Black Bull\\". As a Mexican brawler who escapes his native country becoming a refugee, he goes to Japan to become the strongest fighter of all, no matter what. Leonhalt is the tallest, slowest and most powerful fighter from the game. His rival is Sheen Genus. * - Also known as the \\"Rising Tiger\\". He is a Canadian amateur wrestler who wants to create his own professional wrestling league, and so is searching for strong people to join him. Sheen is the wrestler of the game and a rival to Leonhalt. He has recently appeared in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS as an Action card. *Lee Hae Gwon () - Also known as the \\"White Fang\\". A Korean martial artist who lives in Japan and works for a school. He seeks revenge against the brawler who has been causing disasters in his school: Leonhalt Domador. Lee is one of the fastest characters in the game, with a good arsenal of kicks and various taekwondo techniques. * - Also known as the \\"Brown Bullet\\". He is an African-American boy who is a basketball player and wishes to be famous. To achieve his objective, Bobby traverses the world, waiting to be discovered. Bobby is the fastest and smallest character in the game, and the only one who always has a weapon (specifically, his basketball). He has recently appeared in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS as an Action card, along with Sean Matsuda from Street Fighter III, who is also a basketballer. Ports and related releases The game was later ported to the Neo-Geo AES console, then ported a year later to SNK's Neo Geo CD. In 2008 it was also ported along with a few other Neo-Geo titles also by ADK to the PlayStation 2 as part of the ADK Damashii Game Collection released in Japan only. It has also been ported on the Japanese NeoGeo Mini, in 2018 as one of the 40 games. Celebrating SNK's 40th anniversary. It was later re-released on other NeoGeo Mini systems, the limited edition Christmas, Samurai Shodown and Samurai Spirits versions.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Aggressors of Dark Kombat on their September 1, 1994 issue as being the eighth most- successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Fantastic Journey. On release, GamePro panned the Neo Geo version of the game, saying it \\"combines aspects of Art of Fighting, World Heroes, and Street Fighter without coming close to the complexity or challenge of any of them.\\" They complained of unresponsive controls and the excessively long string of commands required to execute Crazy moves, and remarked that though the sprites are large, they are nonetheless unimpressive due to the uninteresting animations and unoriginal character designs. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly acknowledged the mediocre animations and character designs, but asserted that the game is fun if given a chance, with the strong points including the ability to fight in multiple planes and the humorous crazy moves. They gave it a unanimous score of 7 out of 10. Famitsu scored it a 25 out of 40. Next Generation reviewed the Neo-Geo version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Although moves are difficult to pull off, ADK's crisp look and powerful action make it well worth the trouble.\\" A critic for Next Generation scored the Neo Geo CD version two out of five stars. He contended that despite SNK marketing the game as a 3D fighter, it is purely 2D, and that the ability to fight in multiple planes, while a decent effort at innovation, ultimately has little impact on the gameplay. He concluded that \\"From graphics to moves to sound effects, almost every element in this game is more-or-less average and is not likely to stand out from the enormous 2D fighting library of Neo-Geo.\\" Aggressors of Dark Kombat was awarded Strangest Game of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

Five years later, in 1980, he went to Hong Kong and worked as a tour guide. His idol was Bruce Lee which led him to practise Muay Thai and Taekwondo in Thailand. He won the freestyle fighting championships seven times so his chance finally came when he made his debut in Working Class (1985), which was directed by Tsui Hark and starred Sam Hui. Career In 1986, Lo met Jackie Chan in a disco in Hong Kong, where he was head of security, and Chan hired him as his own bodyguard. Lo not only became Chan's bodyguard but also acted in many martial arts films. One of his best known roles is \\"John\\", the main villain and right-hand man of the British ambassador in Drunken Master II (1994). in which he and Chan engaged in a protracted final fight; Lo stepped in when another actor was injured. That climactic ten-minute fight sequence has become legendary: film critic Roger Ebert called it \\"one of the most remarkably sustained examples of martial arts choreography ever filmed.\\" In 2005, Lo acted in the American action film Into the Sun (2005) with Steven Seagal, with whom he was involved in a fight scene. Lo is still very active in Hong Kong cinema. Personal life Lo married Hong Kong actress Lai Sok-yin (黎淑賢) and they have two sons. The couple divorced in 2006.

The company was formed by financial backer Edouard de Seynes (1881–1957) and engineer Victor Cognet. The partners Edouard de Seynes was just 25 when he first met Viktor Cognet in 1907. De Seynes was born in Avignon but had recently moved to Lyon following his marriage. He still had the impetuosity of youth, and he was passionately interested in things mechanical: also he was rich. He was impressed by the engineering talent of his new friend and soon suggested a business partnership. Viktor Cognet was a little older, and already had a small factory alongside the Heyrieux road, on the south-eastern side of Lyon. Here he manufactured \\"silent gear-boxes\\" to a design over which he had registered a patent. The two of them went into business as sub-contractors for a range of industrial companies in the region, but the idea of becoming automobile manufacturers with their own names on the vehicles was envisaged from early on, and their first car was presented in 1913. Cognet de Seynes automobiles continued to be produced until 1916. During the war the company also made aero engine parts for Anzani. Peace broke out at the end of 1918. The manufacturer retained its head office and factory beside the Heyrieux road, but changed its name to C de S. In 1920 control passed to a man named Ducerf who came from Saint-Étienne and had plans to build a range of cars, using the pre-war design with only minor updating. He planned to make 300 cars a year but this did not happen. Edouard de Seynes took back control and the factory settled down to a production rate of 20 to 30 cars a year. The last cars were made in 1926 when the company closed, being unable to compete with mass manufacturers. The car The first, and as it turned out only model was of a simple design and first appeared in 1912 or 1913 (sources differ) and had a 1124 cc four-cylinder engine with a 3-speed gearbox described as \\"recilinear and without cardan joints\\". It sat on a wheelbase. With three- or four-seat tourer body the car was said to be able to reach . The car reappeared as the \\"C de S 5 HP\\" at the 15th Paris Motor Show in October 1919. The 3 or 4 seater \\"Torpedo\\" bodied tourers were still offered, along with a \\"Conduite interieure\\" (two-box sedan/saloon/berline) version. Also listed was a \\"Camionette (500 Kilos)\\" light van version. Two cars are believed to have survived.

It was established in April 1917 by reorganization of the Russian Caucasus Army and formally ceased to exist in March 1918. Creation The reorganization of the Caucasus Army into the Caucasus Front was undertaken by the Russian Provisional Government as part of the military reforms following the February Revolution. During its entire year of existence, the Front was in a process of disintegration as revolutionary propaganda, the weakening of military discipline, desertion, and disease sapped the Front's strength. General Yudenich was the commander of the Front at its creation. On May 31, 1917, he was removed for refusing to obey the Provisional Government's orders to resume offensive operations against the Turks, and was replaced by General Przhevalsky. =Composition= * Caucasus Army **5th Caucasian Army Corps ***other separate formations **2nd Turkestani Army Corps ***other separate formations **1st Caucasian Army Corps ***other separate formations **6th Caucasian Army Corps ***other separate formations **4th Caucasian Army Corps ***other separate formations **2nd Caucasian Horse Corps ***other separate formations **1st Caucasian Horse Corps ***other separate formations * Additional Front components ** Trapezund Fortified District ***other separate formations ** Kars Fortress ***other separate formations ** Alexandropol Fortress ***other separate formations ** Reserve ***other separate formations Truce and dissolution On December 5 1917 the Armistice of Erzincan was signed between the new Soviet government of Russia and the Turkish Third Army, formally ceasing fighting in the Caucasus. Nevertheless, the Turks continued some offensive operations, taking advantage of the fact that the Caucasus Front had effectively ceased to exist as a cohesive military force. Such resistance as the Turks met was offered by Armenian volunteer militia units. This was followed on March 3, 1918 by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ending all hostilities with the Turks. Since the Caucasus Front dissolved, it did not have a true successor organization. The Army of the North Caucasus, which was renamed 11th Army on October 3, 1918, constituted the main Soviet army in the area during the Russian Civil War.

In Japan, the arcade version was published by Namco, while in North America the arcade version was published by Sharp Image Electronics. Two players control the \\"Blaster Fighter\\" star ships in their efforts to destroy a mysterious mechanical fortress orbiting Earth, with plans to take control of the planet. The Blaster Fighters can equip one of seven available weapons, which will change the ship's firepower and abilities, such as diagonal shots, homing missiles and small drones that follow the player's ship. Air Buster received a favorable reception for its visuals, sound effects and gameplay, although complaints were directed at the difficulty, which was deemed \\"too easy\\" by numerous publications. Ports of the game were released for both the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Genesis, the former being renamed to Aero Blasters for international releases. The Sega Genesis release was ported over to the \\"Project EGG\\" digital storefront in 2014, which remained exclusive to Japan. A version for the Sharp X68000 was in development but never released.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Air Buster is a horizontal-scrolling shoot-em-up game. Players choose between one of the two Blaster fighters through scrolling six stages. The Blaster fighters can equip one of seven weapons. The weapons include the Striker weapon which adds additional firepower through vertically aligned Options, the Reverse shot which fires two diagonal shots from the rear of the ship, the Six Way Shot which fires semi- automatic shots in six directions and the Homing Shot which tracks enemies all around the screen. The other three weapons are Missile-based which vary from Red straight-firing Rockets and Green Homing Missiles. There is also the Border item which surrounds the front of the ship, keeping it from crashing into foreground objects. The only other Items include Power-Ups which increase the ship's standard shot power and Bonus Points that appear in the sign of Dollar signs. Development and release Both home ports are pretty faithful with the Mega Drive/Genesis one being closer to the Arcade original game than the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 one. The Mega Drive/Genesis port runs fullscreen, features more detailed graphics, keeps most of the Arcade version's parallax effects and has better sound effects. The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 port features a slightly expanded ending. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Air Buster on their March 1, 1990 issue as being the third most- successful table arcade game of the year.

Grant went on to play roles in various television shows and movies, including Happy Birthday, Gemini, Legs, Labor of Love, CSI: Miami, Law & Order, Criminal Minds, and Alias. In 2004, he played a gay husband in the remake of The Stepford Wives, and played the father of Anne Hathaway's character in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada.

His first play, Snakebit, premiered at NYC's Grove Street Playhouse and subsequently transferred to the Century Theatre. The play was nominated for the 1999 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play and was also nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award. His second play, Current Events, was produced by Manhattan Theatre Club in 2000. His most recent play, Pen, opened in 2006 at Playwrights Horizons.

In October 2009, he was named 'Head Showrunner'. The show was co-produced by Ken Olin, whom Grant had worked with on thirtysomething many years earlier. In 2012, he was a writer and producer on the NBC musical series Smash.

It was built by George Constantinesco, a Romanian-born engineer and inventor, who had gained fame by his invention of an improved version of a machine gun synchronization gear (a device allowing aircraft-mounted machine guns to fire through the propeller without striking the blades themselves) that replaced the clumsy mechanical linkages that had been previously employed with a hydrostatic device based on his own novel theory of sonics, or \\"wave transmission\\". Mechanical torque converter The inspiration behind the car was Constantinesco's 1923 invention of the \\"oscillating masses\\" mechanical torque converter,http://www.rexresearch.com/constran/1constran.htm which replaced clumsy gear shifting with a smooth, highly efficient, continuously variable transmission. The transmission ratio was determined by the oscillation of a pendulum, the extent of the oscillations being determined by the pendulum's mass, ingenious attachment, and dimensions in combination with the torque and speed of the engine and the road wheels. An oscillating masses torque converter was used to eliminate the need for a complex geared automotive transmissions which were heavy, required shifting gears, and could be inefficient. Compared to a similar car with a gear based transmission, Constantinesco's needed a substantially smaller engine, was lighter overall, and was more fuel efficient. In the car, the mechanical torque converter was embodied in a 494 cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine of his own design, where it was mounted between the engine's cylinders. Demise The car was built in Paris with the gearbox (on the rear axle for forward, neutral and reverse) built in England. It was exhibited at the 1926 Paris Motor Show but only a few were made. General Motors signed a \\"lucrative\\" royalty agreement to manufacture the torque converters, giving Constantinesco a $100,000 advance on royalties, but didn't make any, leaving the inventor deeply in debt and the mechanical torque converter sidelined.

It is the only genus in the subfamily Stylogastrinae, which some authorities have historically treated as a separate family Stylogastridae (or Stylogasteridae). Biology Stylogastrines are obligate associates of Cockroaches, Orthoptera, some Diptera and ants.Couri, M.S., Pont, A.C. & Kirk-Spriggs, A.H. 2013. New Muscidae (Diptera) hosts of Stylogaster Macquart (Diptera: Conopidae) from the Afrotropical Region. African Invertebrates 54 (2): 401–408. These flies typically use army ants' raiding columns to flush out their prey, ground- dwelling Orthoptera and/or roaches. Stylogastrines are somewhat atypical for conopids, in that the egg itself is shaped somewhat like a harpoon, with a rigid barbed tip, and the egg is forcibly jabbed into the host. The female of some species waits for army ants to flush out a target, then she dives in and jabs an egg into the host. The Stylogaster larvae then develop as endoparasitoids. This is a remarkably high-risk behavior, in that many hosts are captured and killed by the ants after a female has laid an egg in it, so many eggs are lost. Adults can occasionally be found at flowers, feeding on nectar with their proboscis, which is longer than the body when unfolded. The female's abdomen is also folded under the body, and is the derivation of the generic name (Stylogaster = \\"needle-tail\\"). Distribution Stylogastrines can be found from the Neotropics to Canada, South America, Africa south of the Sahara, and parts of Southern Asia, including the Philippines and New Guinea.

The festival was sponsored and organised by the Souza Cruz tobacco company, owners of the Hollywood cigarette brand, taking its name from an unrelated festival that occurred in 1975 with an all-Brazilian lineup. After a law was passed by the Senate of Brazil prohibiting tobacco and alcohol companies from sponsoring cultural and sporting events, the festival was cancelled. The festival did not happen in 1989 or 1991 (the latter because of Rock in Rio 2 happening at around the same time in Rio de Janeiro). Origins A festival named Hollywood Rock happened at Botafogo's stadium in Rio de Janeiro and featured performances by Raul Seixas, Rita Lee, O Terço, Vímana, Celly Campelo and Erasmo Carlos, among others. The festival was spearheaded by Nelson Motta, who later on conceded its name rights to Souza Cruz. 1988 The first edition of Hollywood Rock took place in January 1988, with four nights of concerts in each city. The venues for the festival were the Morumbi stadium in São Paulo and the Apoteose Square (the final section of the Sambadrome) in Rio de Janeiro. The headliners for this edition were Supertramp, The Pretenders, Duran Duran and Simple Minds. However, Simply Red, who opened the concert for Duran Duran, was generally considered by press and fans the breakthrough performance of the whole festival, leading them to come back for the 1993 edition, this time boasting headliner status. UB 40, who opened the concert for Simple Minds, also met enthusiastic response from the crowds. The British reggae band distinguished itself as well by receiving a host of guests onstage, like late singer Robert Palmer, Pretenders's leader Chrissie Hynde (who performed live her famous duet with UB 40's Ali Campbell in Sonny Bono's \\"I Got You Babe\\") and Brazilian band Paralamas do Sucesso, who had played previously the same night. The night before, UB 40 had taken part in the Pretenders' concert encore, also performing \\"I Got You Babe\\". The Pretenders' line-up for the festival featured guitarist Johnny Marr, of The Smiths' fame. The other Brazilian acts featured in the bill for the four-night event (from the next edition on, it would be shortened for three nights only) were Ira!, Titãs, Ultraje a Rigor, Lulu Santos and Marina Lima. As for the non-Brazilian acts, they were all touring the country for the first time. 1990 The second Hollywood Rock festival took place from 25th to 27 January 1990, at the same venues as the first edition. The international attractions for this edition of the festival were Bob Dylan, Bon Jovi, Tears for Fears, Terence Trent D'Arby, Eurythmics and Marillion. Terence Trent D'Arby headlined one night in São Paulo only, while Tears for Fears had the same privilege solely in Rio. Bob Dylan and Bon Jovi had headliner status in both cities. As in the first edition, all six acts were touring Brazil for the first time. The originally scheduled Brazilian acts were Gilberto Gil, Barão Vermelho, Lobão, Engenheiros do Hawaii and Capital Inicial. However, Gilberto Gil cancelled the Rio concert because his son, musician Pedro Gil, was hospitalized in critical condition due to a car accident (he would die days later). Margareth Menezes performed in his place, being booked just a few hours before the performance was due to start. 1992 The third edition of Hollywood Rock happened at the Pacaembu stadium in São Paulo, whilst the Rio edition was still held at the Sambadrome. The international lineup was composed of Living Colour, EMF, Seal, Jesus Jones, Skid Row and Extreme, all playing in the country for the first time, while Lulu Santos, Titãs, Paralamas do Sucesso, Barão Vermelho and Cidade Negra formed the Brazilian lineup. At this edition, Brazilian acts had headliner status for the first time, with Titãs and Paralamas do Sucesso closing the second night of the event in both cities. The joint performance featured one-hour slots for each band and an extended encore with both together on stage. Being a band from São Paulo, Titãs performed last on that city; in Rio, local band Paralamas did so. Living Colour and Skid Row were the international headliners. 1993 The fourth edition of Hollywood Rock featured Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana and Simply Red as headliners, with Alice in Chains, L7 and Maxi Priest rounding out the international lineup. The Brazilian acts were Defalla, Biquíni Cavadão, Dr. Sin, Engenheiros do Hawaii and Midnight Blues Band. Due to the high demand for tickets, the venue for the São Paulo concerts was changed back to the larger Morumbi stadium, while the Sambadrome remained the festival's house in Rio. For the first time, Hollywood Rock brought back an international act, Simply Red, featured as opening attraction for Duran Duran at the 1988 edition, and now a headliner. Nirvana's performances have generated controversy among fans and the media, particularly the São Paulo show, which has been described as \\"the worst performance of the trio's career.\\" Prior to the São Paulo performance, Nirvana's vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain had reportedly mixed pills and alcohol to combat his nervousness over playing to such a large crowd, but this affected his guitar playing, and after about 30 minutes the band started playing a \\"karaoke- inspired\\" set instead, exchanging instruments and covering songs by the Clash, Queen, Terry Jacks, Iron Maiden, Duran Duran and others. The band was booed by parts of the audience during this show,Interview with Earnie Bailey, Nirvana's guitar technician although Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic later remembered the experience fondly. In Rio, the band played a more straightforward set, featuring debut performances of the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"Scentless Apprentice.\\" However, this show also featured Cobain spitting into the lenses of the television cameras and briefly exposing himself to one, as well as attempting to destroy parts of the stage, during \\"Scentless Apprentice.\\" Parts of this sequence, along with \\"Dive,\\" part of \\"Aneurysm\\" and a jam of the Aerosmith song \\"Sweet Emotion,\\" appear on the 1994 home video, Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! Cobain mocked the festival's sponsorship by a cigarette company periodically during the performance, and he and drummer Dave Grohl played the encore dressed in lingerie. Alice in Chains' performance in Rio on January 22 was the last concert with original bassist Mike Starr. 1994 The fifth edition of Hollywood Rock once again took place at the Morumbi stadium in São Paulo and the Sambadrome in Rio. The headliners for this edition were Aerosmith, Robert Plant and Whitney Houston. Poison, Ugly Kid Joe and Live completed the international lineup, all performing Brazil for the first time. The Brazilian lineup was formed by Titãs, Sepultura, Skank, Fernanda Abreu and Jorge Ben. Virtually unknown in Brazil at the time, Live was the first international act to perform a daylight time opening concert at Hollywood Rock, before local band Sepultura. 1995 The sixth edition of Hollywood Rock was unique in the sense that Souza Cruz merely used the festival's brand to promote the first Brazilian tour of the Rolling Stones. The concerts were a leg of the Voodoo Lounge Tour and three dates were booked for São Paulo, at the Pacaembu Stadium (January 27, 28 and 30), and two for Rio, at the Maracanã Stadium (February 2 and 4). It was the only edition of Hollywood Rock in Rio not to happen at the Sambadrome. All five dates featured the same lineup, completed by Barão Vermelho, Rita Lee and Spin Doctors. 1996 The seventh and last Hollywood Rock festival was headlined by The Cure, Page and Plant and Gilberto Gil, in the second occurrence of a Brazilian act occupying top spot, and performing a special concert with guests like Carlinhos Brown, Lobão and Fernanda Abreu. For the first time, both international headliners had toured Brazil before. Robert Plant had performed at Hollywood Rock without Jimmy Page in 1994, while The Cure had toured Rio, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre in 1987. Supergrass, White Zombie, Smashing Pumpkins, Urge Overkill, The Black Crowes, Steel Pulse and Aswad completed the international lineup. Pato Fu, Raimundos, Chico Science e Nação Zumbi and Cidade Negra completed the Brazilian lineup, the latter performing after Steel Pulse on the last night, headlined by Gilberto Gil.

The National Romantic style was a Nordic architectural style that was part of the National Romantic movement during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is often considered to be a form of Art Nouveau. The National Romantic style spread across Finland; the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden; the Baltic countries of Estonia and Latvia, as well as in Russia, where it also appeared as Russian Revival architecture. Unlike some nostalgic Gothic Revival style architecture in some countries, Romantic architecture often expressed progressive social and political ideals, through reformed domestic architecture.Barbara Miller Lane, National Romanticism and Modern Architecture in Germany and the Scandinavian Countries (New York: Cambridge University Press), 2000:10. Designers turned to early medieval architecture and even prehistoric precedents to construct a style appropriate to the perceived character of people. The style can be seen as a reaction to industrialism and an expression of the same \\"Dream of the North\\" nationalism that gave impetus to renewed interest in the eddas and sagas.

Up to the 1950s, closed systems were disassembled and cleaned manually. The advent of CIP was a boon to industries that needed frequent internal cleaning of their processes. Industries that rely heavily on CIP are those requiring high levels of hygiene, and include: dairy, beverage, brewing, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics. The benefit to industries that use CIP is that the cleaning is faster, less labor-intensive and more repeatable, and poses less of a chemical exposure risk. CIP started as a manual practice involving a balance tank, centrifugal pump, and connection to the system being cleaned. Since the 1950s, CIP has evolved to include fully automated systems with programmable logic controllers, multiple balance tanks, sensors, valves, heat exchangers, data acquisition and specially designed spray nozzle systems. Simple, manually operated CIP systems can still be found in use today. Depending on soil load and process geometry, the CIP design principle is one of the following: * deliver highly turbulent, high flow-rate solution to effect good cleaning (applies to pipe circuits and some filled equipment). * deliver solution as a low-energy spray to fully wet the surface (applies to lightly soiled vessels where a static sprayball may be used). * deliver a high energy impinging spray (applies to highly soiled or large diameter vessels where a dynamic spray device may be used). Elevated temperature and chemical detergents are often employed to enhance cleaning effectiveness.  Factors affecting the effectiveness of the cleaning agents  Temperature of the cleaning solution. Elevating the temperature of a cleaning solution increases its dirt removal efficiency. Molecules with high kinetic energy dislodge dirt faster than the slow moving molecules of a cold solution. Concentration of the cleaning agent. A concentrated cleaning solution will clean a dirty surface much better than a dilute one due to the increased surface binding capacity. Contact time of the cleaning solution. The longer the detergent contact period, the higher the cleaning efficiency. After some time, the detergent eventually dissolves the hard stains/soil from the dirty surface. Pressure exerted by the cleaning solution (or turbulence). The turbulence creates an abrasive force that dislodges stubborn soil from the dirty surface. Groundwater sources Originally developed for cleaning closed systems as described above, CIP has more recently been applied to groundwater source boreholes used for high end-uses such as natural mineral / spring waters, food production and carbonated soft drinks (CSD). Boreholes that are open to the atmosphere are prone to a number of chemical and microbiological problems, so sources for high end-use are often sealed at the surface (headworks). An air filter is built into the headworks to permit the borehole to inhale and exhale when the water level rises and falls quickly (usually due to the pump being turned on and off) without drawing in airborne particles or contaminants (spores, molds, fungi, bacteria, etc.). In addition, CIP systems can be built into the borehole headworks to permit the injection of cleaning solutions (such as sodium hypochlorite or other sanitizers) and the subsequent recirculation of the mix of these chemicals and the groundwater. This process cleans the borehole interior and equipment without any invasive maintenance being required. Bioreactors, fermentors, and mix vessels CIP is commonly used for cleaning bioreactors, fermenters, mix vessels, and other equipment used in biotech manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and food and beverage manufacturing. CIP is performed to remove or obliterate previous cell culture batch components. It is used to remove in- process residues, control bioburden, and reduce endotoxin levels within processing equipment and systems. Residue removal is accomplished during CIP with a combination of heat, chemical action, and turbulent flow. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a CIP regulation in 1978 applicable to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The regulation states, “Equipment and utensils shall be cleaned, maintained, and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements.”U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1978). \\"Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals: Equipment cleaning and maintenance.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, Repeatable, reliable, and effective cleaning is of the utmost importance in a manufacturing facility. Cleaning procedures are validated to demonstrate that they are effective, reproducible, and under control. In order to adequately clean processing equipment, the equipment must be designed with smooth stainless steel surfaces and interconnecting piping that has cleanable joints. The chemical properties of the cleaning agents must properly interact with the chemical and physical properties of the residues being removed. A typical CIP cycle consists of many steps which often include (in order): * Pre-rinse with WFI (water for injection) or PW (purified water) which is performed to wet the interior surface of the tank and remove residue. It also provides a non-chemical pressure test of the CIP flow path. * Caustic solution single pass flush through the vessel to drain. Caustic is the main cleaning solution. * Caustic solution re-circulation through the vessel. * Intermediate WFI or PW rinse * Acid solution wash – used to remove mineral precipitates and protein residues. * Final rinse with WFI or PW – rinses to flush out residual cleaning agents. * Final air blow – used to remove moisture remaining after CIP cycle. Critical parameters must be met and remain within the specification for the duration of the cycle. If the specification is not reached or maintained, cleaning will not be ensured and will have to be repeated. Critical parameters include temperature, flow rate/supply pressure, chemical concentration, chemical contact time, and final rinse conductivity (which shows that all cleaning chemicals have been removed).

Its members believe they are called to live a substantial degree of withdrawal from everyday life, devoting themselves to prayer in the belief that this prayer, rooted in the praise and worship of God, is essential for the peace and well-being of the world. The Sisters offer their lives to God in prayer and daily life together in Community, seeking to deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ and with one another. Sisters add the suffix SLG to their religious names. Character The Community has always drawn upon Carmelite spirituality: life and prayer in silence and solitude is a very important dimension of the vocation. However, the Community also draws from other traditions, and the Rule is not specifically Carmelite. Another important ingredient is an emphasis on the centrality of Divine Office and Eucharist together in choir, inspired partly by the Benedictine way of life. Convents The Community is situated in England at the Convent of the Incarnation, Fairacres, Oxford. Formerly it had houses at Boxmoor, Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, Burwash in East Sussex, and Staplehurst in Kent.All former convents listed here. One Sister lives at St Isaac’s Retreat, PO Box 93, Opononi 0445, Northland, Aotearoa/New Zealand, the last of a small group who moved there in 1995 to help establish a Diocesan retreat centre. The Reverend Mother is Sister Clare-Louise SLG (assumed office May 2015). The community constructed a convent in the Holy Land in the 1930s, but this phase of work never came to fruition, owing to the outbreak of the second world war.Guide to the Religious Communities of the Anglican Communion, Mowbray, London, 1951 edition, page 88. Publications Members of the Community include the writer Sister Benedicta Ward SLG, translator and editor of The Sayings of the Desert Fathers and other works on the early and medieval Church. The Community has a small publishing house, SLG Press, which was founded in 1967 and produces a magazine twice a year, the Fairacres Chronicle, and short works on prayer and the spiritual life. Current titles include centuries-old classical spiritual texts, such as sayings from the early Christian monks in the desert, studies of significant spiritual writers like Julian of Norwich and George Herbert, and contemporary pamphlets providing guidance in the life of prayer. The publications of SLG Press sell all over the world.

Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The player selects from a jet fighter or helicopter, shoot enemies in the air and ground, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. The game differs from most others in the genre in that you can change the aircraft you use at the start of each level. The jet fighter always shoots straight forward; power-ups increase the width and strength of its shots. The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small \\"spread\\" effect to the shot while moving around). Both the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be \\"directed\\" at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter's shots). Additional bombs can be picked up during the course of the game.

As a younger son of Guðrøðr Crovan, King of Dublin and the Isles, Óláfr witnessed a vicious power struggle between his elder brothers in the aftermath of their father's death. At some point, the young Óláfr was entrusted to the care of Henry I, King of England, and like the contemporaneous Scottish monarchs, Alexander I and David I, Óláfr appears to have been a protégé of the English king. As King of the Isles, Óláfr contracted marital alliances with neighbouring maritime rulers. Although he appears to have overseen successful military operations to reclaim the northernmost territories once controlled by his father, he may have witnessed the loss of authority in Galloway as well. Like his counterpart David I, Óláfr was a reformer and moderniser of his realm. However, his four-decade reign ended in abrupt disaster when he was assassinated by three nephews in 1153. Following the ensuing power struggle, Óláfr's son Guðrøðr overcame the kin- slayers, and assumed the kingship of the Kingdom of the Isles. The Isles—an archipelagic region roughly incorporating the Hebrides and Mann—was ruled by Guðrøðr Crovan for over two decades until his death in 1095, whereupon his eldest son Lǫgmaðr assumed control. Warring soon broke out between factions supporting Lǫgmaðr's younger brother Haraldr, which led to the intervention and encroachment of Irish power into the region. After a short period of Irish domination, the region lapsed into further conflict which was capitalised on by Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway, who led two military campaigns throughout the Isles and surrounding Irish Sea region at about the turn of the twelfth century. Magnús dominated these regions until his death in 1103, whereupon control of the Isles appears to have fragmented into chaos once again. Rather than allow ambitious Irish powers fill the power vacuum, Henry I appears to have installed Óláfr on the throne at some point between 1112 and 1115, about the time that Domnall mac Taidc relocated from the Isles to Ireland. Óláfr is recorded to have spent his youth at Henry I's court, and Óláfr's later religious foundations reveal that he was greatly influenced by his English upbringing. In the second quarter of the eleventh century, Óláfr founded Rushen Abbey, a reformed religious house on Mann. He further oversaw the formation of the Diocese of the Isles, the territorial extent of which appears to reveal the boundaries of his realm. Óláfr is recorded to have had at least two wives: Ingibjǫrg, daughter of Hákon Pálsson, Earl of Orkney; and Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. The unions seem to reveal that Óláfr shifted from an alliance with Orkney to that with Galloway. Not long after his marriage to Affraic, one of Óláfr's daughters married Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll, an emerging power in the region. Although Óláfr's reign is recorded to have been peaceful, there is reason to suspect that his own succession was uncertain. In 1152, Guðrøðr travelled to Norway and rendered homage to Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway. At about this time, the Diocese of the Isles was incorporated within the recently elevated Archdiocese of Niðaróss. Whilst this strengthened Norwegian links with the Isles, it secured the ecclesiastical independence of Óláfr's domain, and safeguard his secular authority in the region. Nevertheless, before Guðrøðr returned to the Isles, three sons of Haraldr confronted Óláfr, and demanded a share of the kingdom before slaying him. Although the three men appear to have taken significant steps to counter military intervention from Galloway, they were soon after crushed by Guðrøðr, who returned to the region strengthened by Norwegian military might. Óláfr's descendants went on to reign as kings of the Isles for over a century. Background Locations relating to Óláfr's life and times.

Guðrøðr Crovan's downfall came in 1094 when he was forced from Ireland altogether by Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster.Duffy (2006) pp. 63–64; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Duffy (2004); Duffy (1992) pp. 107–108. There is reason to suspect that Guðrøðr Crovan was driven from Mann as well, since he is recorded to have died on Islay the following year.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 47–48; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Duffy (1992) p. 108. According to the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, Guðrøðr Crovan's eldest son, Lǫgmaðr, succeeded to the kingship of the Isles.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 23; Oram, RD (2011) p. 48; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Oram, RD (2000) p. 20; Candon (1988) p. 404; Anderson (1922) p. 98; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. The chronicle further reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced opposition from within his own family in the form of a rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had him blinded and emasculated.McDonald, RA (2019) pp. 23, 64–65; Parsons (2019) p. 277; Oram, RD (2011) p. 48; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 84, 96; Duffy (2006) pp. 63, 65; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Hudson (2005) p. 198; Power (2005) p. 11; Beuermann (2002) pp. 421–423; Oram, RD (2000) pp. 21, 58; Gade (1994) p. 199; Power (1986) p. 115; Macquarrie, AD (1982) p. 56; Anderson (1922) p. 98; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. Afterwards, Lǫgmaðr appears to have faced further opposition in the form of a faction supporting his youngest brother, Óláfr. Apparently unable to overthrow Lǫgmaðr on their own, the dissidents turned to Muirchertach, whose recent conquest of Dublin gave him control of that realm's dominating naval forces.Oram, RD (2011) p. 48; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21. The name of Domnall mac Taidc as it appears on folio 33v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII (the Chronicle of Mann): \\"'\\".Duffy (2006) p. 63; Duffy (1992) p. 109 n. 76; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). If the chronicle is to be believed, Óláfr's supporters petitioned Muirchertach to provide a regent from his own kin—the Uí Briain—to govern the Isles until Óláfr was old enough to assume control himself.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146, 146 n. 83; Wolf (2014) pp. 71–72; Oram, RD (2011) p. 48; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 168; Duffy (2006) pp. 63–64; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Duffy (2002a) p. 57; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21; Ní Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 375; Duffy (1992) pp. 108–109; Anderson (1922) pp. 100–101; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. Such a clause may well have been a condition of Muirchertach's involvement, rather than a request.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21. Nevertheless, the chronicle indicates that Muirchertach installed his nephew, Domnall mac Taidc, upon the throne. Although Domnall had previously opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he was the son of Muirchertach's brother, and further possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21; Duffy (1992) p. 109. Regardless, the death of Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, recorded by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1096,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1096.8; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1096.8; Ó Corráin (2010) p. 225; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 65 n. 37; Candon (2006) p. 116; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Power (2005) pp. 11–12; Duffy (2002a) p. 57; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21; Duffy (1992) p. 109; Anderson (1922) p. 99. suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition in the Isles,Candon (2006) p. 116; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21. possibly in the form of Lǫgmaðr's adherents.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21. Domnall's reign appears to have been brief. The chronicle's account of warfare on the island in about 1097–1098 fails to mention him at all, a fact which seems to be evidence that he had lost control by then.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21; Anderson (1922) pp. 101–102; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 56–57. Magnús Óláfsson as it appears on folio 46v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1103.6; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1103.6; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (2008). Probably late in 1097, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway turned his attention towards the Isles, and sent a certain Ingimundr into the region to take control on his behalf. Unfortunately for Magnús, Ingimundr was soon after slain on Lewis and Harris by leading Islesmen.Oram, RD (2011) p. 48; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 236–237; Oram, RD (2000) p. 21; Power (1986) pp. 115–116. The following year Magnús took matters into his own hands, and led an invasion-fleet of his into the area.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 48–49; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 237. As the invaders successfully carved their way through the Isles towards Mann, Lǫgmaðr was evidently overcome and captured.Oram, RD (2011) p. 49; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 237; Power (2005) p. 12. From Mann, the Norwegians campaigned against the English in Anglesey. Although Magnúss saga berfœtts, within the thirteenth century Heimskringla, places this particular episode in the context of Norwegian conquest, it is likely that Magnús had merely assumed the same protector role that Óláfr's father had once filled with Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd.Finlay; Faulkes (2015) pp. 135–136 ch. 10; Hollander (2011) pp. 676–677 ch. 10; Oram, RD (2011) p. 50; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 237; Duffy (2002a) p. 57, 57 n. 16; Oram, RD (2000) p. 42; Duffy (1992) p. 110, 110 n. 82; Anderson (1922) pp. 110–111; Jónsson (1911) p. 524 ch. 10; Storm (1899) pp. 538–539 ch. 10; Unger (1868) pp. 647–648 ch. 11; Laing (1844) pp. 131–133 ch. 11.

After reestablishing himself on Mann, Magnús entered into a marital alliance with Muirchertach formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr, and Muirchertach's young daughter, Bjaðmunjo.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 146–147; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240; Bracken (2004); Duffy (2002a) pp. 58–59; Holland (2000) pp. 129–130, 130 n. 86; Oram, RD (2000) p. 43; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Ní Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 375, 375 n. 71; Duffy (1993) pp. 37–38; Duffy (1992) pp. 110–112; Candon (1988) pp. 406–407; Power (1986) pp. 125–126. The fact that Magnús intended to return to Norway reveals that Muirchertach benefited to most from the arrangement, although the alliance appears to have bound the kings against a common enemy in the region, Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, and Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Muirchertach was able to regain control of Dublin and still had held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death left a vacuum which neither Muirchertach nor Domnall Mac Lochlainn could fill.Oram, RD (2011) p. 51; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 240; Oram, RD (2000) p. 44. Restoration of the Crovan dynasty If the Chronicle of Mann is to be believed, at one point in his career Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom before setting off to Jerusalem where he died.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 23; Parsons (2019) p. 277, 277 n. 26; McDonald, RA (2016) p. 342; Beuermann (2014) p. 85; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 84; Duffy (2006) p. 63; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Hudson (2005) p. 198; Oram, RD (2000) pp. 21, 58; Candon (1988) p. 404; Power (1986) p. 115; Macquarrie, AD (1982) pp. 19, 56–57; McRoberts (1969) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 98; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. The particular terminology employed by the chronicle—that Lǫgmaðr departed the kingdom \\"marked with the sign of the Lord's cross\\"—suggests that he participated in a crusade.Parsons (2019) pp. 277–278; Casey (2014) pp. 130–132; Hudson (2005) p. 198; Kostick (2003); Anderson (1922) p. 98; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. On the other hand, since the chronicle was compiled in the thirteenth century, during a period when the idea of a cross-bearing pilgrim was well established, it is possible that this depiction of Lǫgmaðr has been contaminated by anachronistic conceptions.Parsons (2019) p. 278; Kostick (2003). The name of Lǫgmaðr Guðrøðarson as it appears on folio 33v of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"'\\". The excerpt describes Lǫgmaðr as the son of Guðrøðr Crovan, king of the 'Jónsson (1916) p. 118; AM 47 Fol (n.d.).—an Old Norse term meaning \\"Southern Islands\\", roughly equating to the Hebrides and Mann.Dumville (2018) p. 113; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 152; Williams, G (2007) pp. 130–132 n. 8. If Lǫgmaðr was indeed a crusader, it is uncertain which particular crusade he undertook. One possibility is that he took part in the First Crusade,McDonald, RA (2016) p. 342; Oram, RD (2011) p. 49 n. 40; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 237; Kostick (2003); Riley-Smith (2002) p. 214; Runciman (1999) p. 47; Macquarrie, A (1982); Macquarrie, AD (1982) pp. 19, 56–59; McRoberts (1969) p. 85. a movement that reached its climax with the successful siege and capture of Jerusalem in mid 1099.Riley-Smith (1999) pp. 1–2. Lǫgmaðr could have embarked upon this enterprise in about 1096, the year the pope's calls reached England.Macquarrie, AD (1982) pp. 56–59. Alternately, in light of Lǫgmaðr's capture by the Norwegians in 1098, it is conceivable that his release from custody was made conditional upon his exile and participation in the First Crusade.Oram, RD (2011) p. 49 n. 40; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 237. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Lǫgmaðr originally undertook a pilgrimage before catching wind of the crusade en route.Kostick (2003). Another possibility is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land in the first decade of the twelfth century.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 23; Parsons (2019) p. 278; Casey (2014) p. 132; Hudson (2005) pp. 198–199. The precise chronology of this enterprise is uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century.Doxey (1996). It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.Hudson (2005) pp. 198–199. Certainly, the chronicle reveals that Óláfr was brought up at the English court.McDonald, RA (2016) pp. 340–341; Downham (2013) p. 171; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 74 n. 37; Green, JA (2006) p. 288; Beuermann (2002) p. 425; Holland (2000) p. 131; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 218; Anderson (1922) p. 134; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. The reason why he was entrusted into the care of the English may have been because Henry I was thought to have been the only monarch who could guarantee Óláfr's safety.McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 65. The name of Havelok the Dane name as it appears on folio 207v of Oxford Bodleian Library Laud Miscellaneous 108: \\"'\\".Skeat (1902) pp. fpc, 24. This literary character may have been first crafted because of Óláfr's presence at the English court. A probable tenth-century ancestor of Óláfr was the Uí Ímair dynast Óláfr kváran, King of Northumbria and Dublin,Hudson (2005) p. 83 fig. 3; Duffy (2004); Oram, RD (2000) p. 19. This man was likely the prototype of the mediaeval literary character variously known as Havelok the Dane.Parker (2016) p. 428 n. 2; McGuigan (2015) p. 24; Hudson (2005) pp. 33, 210; Levy (2004) p. 284; Ege (2000) pp. 192–193; Lambdin (2000). The earliest surviving source detailing Havelok is the twelfth-century Estoire des Engleis.Hudson (2005) pp. 33, 210; Kleinman (2003) p. 245; Ege (2000) p. 192. The catalyst for Óláfr kváran's incorporation into twelfth-century English literature may have been Óláfr's stay at the court of Henry I. Conceivably, writers may have sought out the patronage of the young Óláfr by borrowing tales of his famous like-named forebear.Hudson (2005) pp. 203–204. The name and title of Muirchertach Ua Briain as it appears on folio 19r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488 (the Annals of Tigernach): \\"'\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2010) § 1088.3; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 1088.3; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Under Muirchertach, the Irish Uí Briain kindred sought to extend its influence into the Isles. According to the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum, Alexander I, King of Scotland struggled to maintain control of his kingdom.Oram, RD (2011) p. 59; Anderson (1908) p. 155 n. 1; Arnold (1885) p. 275 ch. 210; Stevenson (1855) p. 611. One region which may have caused the Scots some concern was the Isles. In 1111, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the region, possibly with the aid of Muirchertach's northern opponent, Domnall Mac Lochlainn. This encroachment of competing Irish factions into the Isles may well have been as unpalatable to the English and Scots as the power vacuum left in the wake of Magnús' demise.Oram, RD (2011) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 115. The exact date of his accession to the kingship of the Isles is uncertain.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 11. Although the chronicle claims that he began to reign in 1102,McDonald, RA (2019) p. 11; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. it also states that he reigned for forty years,McDonald, RA (2019) pp. 11, 65; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 85; Duffy (2006) p. 64 n. 73; Duffy (2002a) p. 60; Oram, RD (2000) p. 59; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 37; Power (1986) pp. 115–116; Anderson (1922) p. 134; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. and shows that he died in 1153.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 11; Anderson (1922) pp. 137 n. 1, 225; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65. If this reign length is correct, his accession probably dates to about 1112,Wadden (2014) p. 31; Oram, RD (2011) p. 59; Oram, RD (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 126; Anderson (1922) p. 134; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. 1113,McDonald, RA (2019) pp. 11, 65; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 150; McDonald, RA (2007a) pp. 51, 74 n. 37; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 27 tab. 1, 85, 65, 117–118, 130, 168, 194; Davey, PJ (2006a); Davey, PJ (2006b); Duffy (2006) pp. 53, 64; Hudson (2005) p. 202; Woolf (2004) p. 103; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Oram, RD (2000) p. 59; Anderson (1922) p. 134; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. 1114,Byrne (2008) p. 164; Woolf (2004) p. 103; Woolf (2001); McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175 n. 52. or 1115.Pollock (2005) p. 15 n. 72; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175 n. 52; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 37. In any case, Óláfr's accession dates to about the time of Muirchertach's faltering authority in 1114.Duffy (2002a) p. 60. Domnall may have been driven out of the Isles by force,Hudson (2005) p. 5. or he could have been drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise upon his uncle's failing health and fleeting authority.Duffy (2006) p. 64; Duffy (2002a) p. 60; Oram, RD (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 115. Óláfr's return to the Isles from England appears to have been the work of Henry I,Oram, RD (2011) p. 59; Pollock (2005) p. 15 n. 72; Duffy (2002a) p. 60; Oram, RD (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 115. who would have likely welcomed a steadfast dependent in control a region of strategic importance. Although the English and Scottish kings were certainly at odds over Cumbria at about this time, it is likely that they would have cooperated to combat the extension of Uí Briain and Meic Lochlainn influence in the Isles. In fact, the Scottish king's participation in the 1114 English expedition against Gruffudd—a man who seems to have been an associate of Muirchertach—may have been undertaken in this context.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 59–60. Furthermore, Muirchertach was closely associated with the Bellême- Montgomery family that had risen in a failed revolt against the English Crown in the first decade of the century.Oram, RD (2000) p. 59. According to the twelfth-century Gesta regum Anglorum, the English imposed a trade embargo against Muirchertach at some point during the reign of Henry I. Whilst it is possible that this action was a consequence of Muirchertach's familial relationship with his son-in-law Arnulf de Montgomery—and Muirchertach's apparent part in the Bellême-Montgomery insurrection—another possibility is that the sanctions concerned Muirchertach's ambitions in the Irish Sea region, especially since Óláfr had been entrusted into Henry I's care.Holland (2000) p. 131; Giles (1847) p. 443 bk. 5; Hardy (1840) p. 638 bk. 5 ch. 409. By establishing Óláfr in the Isles, Henry I may have sought to mitigate the extension of Irish influence in the Isles,Pollock (2005) p. 15 n. 72; Duffy (2002a) p. 60; Duffy (1992) p. 115. and escalate the expansion of English authority into the Irish Sea region. Alliances The name of Óláfr's wife, Affraic ingen Fergusa, as it appears on folio 35v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). According to the Chronicle of Mann, Óláfr married Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 60; McDonald, RA (2016) pp. 339, 342; Wadden (2014) pp. 31–32; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 75, 154; Russell; McClure; Rollason (2007) p. 35; Williams, G (2007) p. 130 n. 7; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175; Sellar (2000) pp. 197–198; Oram, RD (1988) pp. 34, 79; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. Although the union is not dated by contemporary sources,Oram, RD (1988) p. 79. it appears to have been arranged in the 1130s or 1140s.Oram, R (2004) p. 119; Oram, RD (1993) p. 116; Oram, RD (1988) p. 79; Anderson (1922) p. 226 n. 2. Affraic is specifically identified as the mother of Guðrøðr by the chronicle.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 342; Wadden (2014) pp. 31–32; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 154; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. The fact that he is recorded to have travelled to Norway on a diplomatic mission in 1152 suggests that he was an adult by this date, and may indicate that Óláfr and Affraic's union commenced in the 1130s. Several contemporary sources concerning Fergus' descendants suggest that he had married an illegitimate daughter of Henry I in about the 1120s,Oram, RD (2011) p. 85; Oram, RD (1993) p. 116. and that this woman was the mother of at least some of Fergus' offspring, including Affraic herself.Oram, RD (1988) pp. 71–72, 79. In fact, the shared kinship between Guðrøðr and Henry I's succeeding grandson, Henry II, King of England, is noted by the twelfth- century Chronica of Robert de Torigni, Abbot of Mont Saint-Michel.Oram, RD (2000) p. 60; Oram, RD (1993) p. 116; Oram, RD (1988) pp. 72, 99; Lawrie (1910) p. 115; Anderson (1908) p. 245; Howlett (1889) pp. 228–229. The marital alliance forged between Óláfr and Fergus gave the Crovan dynasty valuable familial-connections with the English king, one of the most powerful rulers in western Europe.Oram, RD (1993) p. 116; Oram, RD (1988) p. 79. Fergus profited from the marriage pact as well, since it bound Galloway more tightly to the Isles,Oram, RD (1993) p. 116; Oram, RD (1988) p. 80. a neighbouring realm from which Galloway had been invaded during the time of Magnús' overlordship.Oram, RD (2011) p. 49; Oram, RD (1993) p. 116; Duffy (1992) p. 110, 110 n. 81; Oram, RD (1988) pp. 10, 78, 80; Anderson (1922) p. 103; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 58–59. The union also ensured Fergus the protection of one of Britain's most formidable fleets, and gave him a valuable ally then outwith the orbit of the Scottish king.Oram, RD (1988) p. 80. queen gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 157 fig. 2a, 163 fig. 8d, 187 fig. 14. Almost nothing is known of queenship in the Isles.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 163. Óláfr's dealings with Furness Abbey—a religious house founded by the Lord of Lancaster, Stephen of BloisTinmouth (2018) p. 47; Oram, RD (2000) p. 84 n. 98.—could be evidence that Óláfr and Stephen enjoyed amiable relations in the first third of the twelfth century, and may indicate that Óláfr supported Stephen as King of England after 1135.Oram, RD (2011) p. 88; Oram, R (2004) p. 118; Oram, RD (2000) pp. 71, 84 n. 98. At about this time, David I appears to have consolidated his overlordship of Argyll, a region located on the western periphery of the Scottish realm.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 88–89; Oram, R (2004) p. 114–118. By about 1140, not only had Óláfr and Fergus bound themselves together,Oram, RD (2011) pp. 88–89; Oram, R (2004) pp. 118–119. but Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll married one of Óláfr's illegitimate daughters.Oram, RD (2011) p. 88; Oram, R (2004) p. 118; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175 n. 55; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 45; Anderson (1922) p. 255 n. 1. Although the name of this woman is not recorded by the Chronicle of Mann, she is identified as Ragnhildr by the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga.McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175 n. 55; McDonald, A (1995) p. 206; Anderson (1922) p. 255 n. 1; Vigfusson (1887) p. 210 ch. 110; Flateyjarbok (1862) p. 508 ch. 439; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 181 ch. 104. The marital binding of Óláfr with two of David I's dependants—Fergus and Somairle—roughly coincided with the Scottish king's endeavour to establish control of Cumbria in the 1130s and 1140s.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 88–89. During this period, David's authority extended southwards along the Cumbrian coast through Copeland, Furness, into Stephen's former honour of Lancaster, thereby making him a principal power in the northern Irish Sea region.Oram, R (2004) p. 119. The martial alliances concerning Óláfr, therefore, may have formed part of a Scottish strategy to not only isolate him from an English alliance, but to project Scottish authority into the Irish Sea,Oram, RD (2011) pp. 88–89; Oram, R (2004) p. 119. and draw Óláfr into David I's sphere of influence.Oram, R (2004) pp. 118–119; Oram, RD (2004). Hákon Pálsson, as it appears on folio 37r of AM 47 fol: \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 130 ch. 1; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). Besides his wife Affraic, the chronicle states that Óláfr had many concubines by whom he had several daughters—including the daughter married to Somairle—and three sons: Rǫgnvaldr, Lǫgmaðr, and Haraldr.McDonald, RA (2019) pp. 60, 62; McDonald, RA (2016) p. 342; Wadden (2014) pp. 31–32; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 75; Williams, G (2007) pp. 130 n. 7, 147; Beuermann (2002) p. 423; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175, 175 n. 55; Sellar (2000) pp. 197–198; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 45; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. The B-text of the thirteenth-century Fagrskinna records that Óláfr married Ingibjǫrg, daughter of Hákon Pálsson, Earl of Orkney.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 339; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 71 n. 23; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 72, 75; Finlay (2004) p. 302; Anderson (1922) p. 139 n. 2; Jónsson (1903) pp. 391–392. Whilst Ingibjǫrg is not referred to by the chronicle,Crawford, BE (2014) p. 66. she is certainly linked to Óláfr by Orkneyinga saga,Crawford, BE (2014) p. 66, 66 n. 7; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 72; Sellar (2000) pp. 196–198; Anderson (1922) p. 350 n. 2; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 82 ch. 56, 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 69 ch. 45, 195 ch. 114 although this source also incorrectly states—in a passage concerning Guðrøðr's son and successor, Rǫgnvaldr—that Ingibjǫrg was Guðrøðr's mother.Crawford, BE (2014) p. 66 n. 7; Beuermann (2008); McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 72; Williams, G (2007) pp. 146–147, 147 n. 39; Sellar (2000) pp. 196–198; Anderson (1922) p. 350 n. 2; Vigfusson (1887) p. 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 195 ch. 114. As a consequence of this error, there is reason to suspect that the saga has conflated Guðrøðr's son with Somairle's like-named son, Ragnall. The saga's confused entry, therefore, may be evidence that Ingibjǫrg was the mother of Óláfr's daughter, Ragnhildr.Williams, G (2007) pp. 147–148; Sellar (2000) p. 198. The terminology employed by the sources documenting Affraic and Ingibjǫrg reveal that the latter's relationship with Óláfr came to be viewed differently in Orkney than the Isles.Williams, G (2007) p. 130 n. 7. Although Orkneyinga saga acknowledges that the union between Ingibjǫrg's own parents was not a canonical marriage either, the coupling formed the basis for her family's claim to the earldom.Williams, G (2007) p. 130 n. 7; Anderson (1922) p. 139 n. 2; Vigfusson (1887) p. 82 ch. 56; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 69 ch. 45. Whatever the case, Óláfr's union with Ingibjǫrg likely predates his marriage to Affraic.Oram, RD (1988) p. 79; Anderson (1922) p. 137 n. 2. Accordingly, Óláfr appears to have turned from an alliance with Ingibjǫrg's brother and Norwegian dependant, Páll Hákonarson, Earl of Orkney, to establish an alliance with Fergus, who was then a rising power in the Irish Sea region. The end result of this shift may be alluded to by the chronicle which states that Óláfr held peaceful alliances with Irish and Scottish kings so that none \\"dared disturbed\\" the Kingdom of the Isles.Duffy (1993) pp. 30, 107; Oram, RD (1988) p. 79; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. Ecclesiastical foundations and appointments bishop gaming piece, one of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 157 fig. 2i, 188 fig. 15, 192 tab. 5. Whilst at the English royal court, Óláfr could well have met members of the Scottish monarchy. For example, Henry I's wife was Matilda,McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 65–66. whose royal brothers, Alexander I and the future David I, King of Scotland, both resided in England before the onset of their reigns (the brothers respectively reigned in 1102–1124 and 1124–1153). Óláfr would have certainly been exposed to Henry I's efforts to reform the English Church.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 194; Hudson (2005) p. 202. Both Matilda and her husband were renowned patrons of religious orders, the Augustinians in particular.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 194. Although Óláfr's stay at Henry's court predated the arrival of the Savignac and Cisterian orders in England, Óláfr's experiences in England clearly influenced his decision to introduce reformed monastic orders into his own realm.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 194; Davey, PJ (2006a); Davey, PJ (2006b); Hudson (2005) p. 202; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 218; McIntire (1943) p. 1. In fact, the ecclesiastical actions of Óláfr's Scottish contemporaries—David I, and his predecessing Alexander I—were similarly influenced by their time spent in England. Óláfr's interest in religious reform is alluded to by the Chronicle of Mann, which declares: \\"he was devout and enthusiastic in matters of religion and was welcome both to God and men\\".McDonald, RA (2019) pp. viii, 24; McDonald, RA (2016) p. 342; Beuermann (2014) p. 85; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 184; Lowe (1988) p. 33; Anderson (1922) p. 184; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 62–63. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction within Óláfr's kingdom was the Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium.Woolf (2003) pp. 171, 180. Ecclesiastical interconnection between the Isles and Dublin seems to have been severed during a period of Irish overlordship of Dublin, at about the beginning of Guðrøðr Crovan's reign in the Isles.Woolf (2003) pp. 171–172. By the time of Óláfr's reign, the diocese appears to have encompassed the islands that had formerly been claimed by Magnús,Oram, RD (2011) p. 50; Power (2005) p. 25. and may well have included territory in western Galloway.Hudson (2005) p. 202; Woolf (2003). In a letter that appears to date to about 1113, at about start of his reign, Óláfr presented an unnamed bishop for consecration to an Archbishop of York. Although the letter identifies the bishop with the initial \\"G\\", which potentially could represent Gerald, whose tenure dates to 1100–1108,Woolf (2003) p. 173; Beuermann (2002) pp. 426–427 n. 40; Watt (1994) pp. 110–111; Oliver (1861) p. 7. the fact that Óláfr's reign appears to have commenced several years later suggests that the initial is erroneous, and that the initial \\"T\\" was intended, perhaps in reference to either archbishop Thomas, or the Thomas' successor, Thurstan.Woolf (2003) p. 173. No consecration is recorded in English sources, and Óláfr's candidate is not recorded in the chronicle.Woolf (2003) p. 173; Watt (1994) pp. 110–111; Anderson (1922) p. 95 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114–115. Ruinous Rushen Abbey, near Ballasalla. The actual abbey founded by Óláfr may have been located near Castletown, before removing to Ballasalla late in the twelfth century.McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 199–200; Broderick (2002) pp. 165–166. In about 1134, the chronicle reveals that Óláfr founded the Rushen Abbey on Mann by granting Ivo, Abbot of Furness land to establish the house.Flanagan (2010) p. 161; Green, J (2007) p. 48; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 194; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Beuermann (2002) p. 427 n. 41; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 217; McDonald, A (1995) p. 204; Watt (1994) p. 111; Duffy (1993) p. 57; Lowe (1988) p. 33; Anderson (1922) pp. 183–184; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 62–63; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) p. 229. As a Savignac daughter house of nearby Furness Abbey—a religious house seated just across the Irish Sea in Lancashire—Rushen Abbey was the first reformed house in the Isles,McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 66; Hudson (2005) p. 202. and its foundation partly evidences the importance of links between Mann and northern England.Green, J (2007) p. 48. During his tenure as archbishop (1114–1140), Thurstan was a proponent of ecclesiastical reform in northern England, and there is reason to suspect that he played an active role in Óláfr's foundation. Not only did it continue Thurstan's programme of monastic reform, but it further extended the ecclesiastical authority of the Archdiocese of York.Tinmouth (2018) pp. 49, 54. In any case, the abbey's foundation charter reveals that Óláfr granted the monks of Furness the right to elect the Bishop of the Isles,Tinmouth (2018) p. 56; Crawford, DKE (2016) p. 107; McDonald, RA (2016) pp. 342–343; Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Oram, RD (2011) p. 103; Flanagan (2010) p. 161; Davey, PJ (2008) p. 1; Davey, PJ (2006c); McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 66, 66. n. 45; Hudson (2005) p. 202; Bridgland (2004) p. 86; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Beuermann (2002) p. 427, 427 n. 42; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 207–208; Watt (1994) p. 111; Lowe (1988) pp. 33–34, 42; McIntire (1943) p. 2; Brownbill (1919) pp. 708–709 § 1; Oliver (1861) pp. 1–3; Beck (1844) p. 123; Document 1/13/1 (n.d.). a provision that not only emphasised Óláfr's royal prerogative,Davey, PJ (2008) p. 1. but allowed Furness to funnel continental influences into the Isles.Tinmouth (2018) p. 55. The charter implies that episcopal authority within his realm had fallen to outsiders, and expresses the king's desire that the Isles be administered by its own bishop.Woolf (2003) p. 174; Beuermann (2002) p. 426; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 347; Brownbill (1919) pp. 708–709 § 1; Oliver (1861) pp. 1–3; Beck (1844) p. 123; Document 1/13/1 (n.d.). This could be evidence that the former diocesan bishop, Hamond, died several years previous, and that a period of vacancy ensued in which neighbouring bishops took up the slack.Woolf (2003) p. 174; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 347. The reestablishment of the Diocese of Whithorn in 1128, may have been undertaken in this context, and may also signal the loss of western Galloway from the Kingdom of the Isles.Hudson (2005) p. 202; Woolf (2003) pp. 173, 180. The name of Wimund as it appears on folio 122v of British Library Cotton Vespasian B VI (Historia rerum Anglicarum).Anderson (1908) pp. 223; Howlett (1884) p. 73; Cotton MS Vespasian B VI (n.d.). In a letter that probably dates not long after his foundation, Óláfr wrote to Thurstan, and confirmed the candidate elected by the monks of Furness.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 345; Oram, RD (2011) p. 103; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 188, 194, 198; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Beuermann (2002) pp. 426–427, 426 n. 36, 427 n. 43; Raine (1894) pp. 58–59; McIntire (1943) pp. 3–4; Anderson (1908) p. 224 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 269–271; Brownbill (1919) p. 709 § 2; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 218–219; Oliver (1861) pp. 4–6; Beck (1844) p. 123. Hamond's successor appears to have been the shadowy Wimund, Bishop of the Isles.Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. According to the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, Wimund began his ecclesiastical career at Furness before removing to Rushen.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 103–104; McDonald, A (2004); Oram, R (2004) p. 183; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174; Watt (1994) p. 115; Anderson (1922) p. 97 n. 1; Anderson (1908) pp. 223–224; Howlett (1884) p. 73. Although a twelfth-century chronicle of the ecclesiastical history of York states that Wimund professed obedience to Thomas, this archbishop's early tenure (1109–1114) suggests he has been confused with Thurstan.Oram, R (2004) p. 183; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Watt (1994) p. 107; Raine (1886) p. 372; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 189–190; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 21. The fact that this source identifies Wimund's see as ' (\\"the holy Church of Skye\\") seems to be evidence that the diocesan seat had not yet been permanently centred on Mann,Thomas (2014) pp. 258–259; Oram, RD (2011) p. 103; Oram, R (2004) p. 183; Woolf (2003) p. 173; Watt (1994) p. 107; Raine (1886) p. 372; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 189–190; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 21. and that Wimund was seated at the site of the later mediaeval Snizort Cathedral.Thomas (2014) p. 259; Hudson (2005) p. 182; Oram, R (2004) p. 183. As a monk of Furness, Wimund may have originally relocated to Mann in the context of Óláfr's foundation of Rushen.Oram, R (2004) p. 183; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. He appears to have been the first Bishop of the Isles elected by the monks of Furness,Oram, RD (2011) p. 103; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 188; Oram, R (2004) p. 183; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. and seems to have been consecrated by Thurstan. Wimund appears to have used his elevated position to violently seek the inheritance of an Earl of Moray in the late 1140s. Wimund's warring against the Scots eventually forced David I to cede him lands near Furness before his capture and mutilation in 1152.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 103–104; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 188; McDonald, A (2004); Woolf (2004) pp. 103–104; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. It is likely that Wimund's campaigning led to the abandonment of his diocesan see,McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 188–189; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. and that his actions posed a serious threat to Óláfr's authority.Beuermann (2014) p. 93 n. 43. Extent of the Diocese of the Isles, c.1300.Watt (2003) p. 399 map 20.1; Woolf (2003) p. 177; Barrell (2002) p. xxiv map 3. The fact that Wimund is not listed amongst other diocesan bishops by the Chronicle of Mann could be evidence that Óláfr eventually came to repudiate him.Watt (1994) p. 115, 115 n. 5; Anderson (1922) pp. 95–98 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114–115, A letter from Óláfr to the chapter of York suggests that the king unsuccessfully attempted to have a replacement, a certain Nicholas, consecrated by Robert de Ghent, Dean of York.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 189; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174; Beuermann (2002) p. 428, 428 n. 47; Watt (1994) p. 116, 116 n. 5; McIntire (1943) p. 5; Anderson (1908) p. 224 n. 1; Raine (1894) pp. 59–60; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 272–273; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 219–220; Brownbill (1919) pp. 709–710 § 3; Oliver (1861) pp. 49–51; Beck (1844) p. 169; Document 1/13/3 (n.d.). The fact that Óláfr interacted with the dean suggests that the correspondence dates between the 1147 deposition of William fitz Herbert, Archbishop of York and the 1152 consecration of Henry Murdac, Archbishop of York.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 189; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174; Beuermann (2002) p. 428, 428 n. 47; Watt (1994) p. 116, 116 n. 5. Óláfr's inability to have his man consecrated may have been due to the Wimund episode being unresolved at the time.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 189; Woolf (2003) pp. 173–174. According to Robert de Torigni's ChronicaWoolf (2003) p. 174; Beuermann (2002) p. 428, 428 n. 47; Watt (1994) pp. 116–117; Howlett (1889) p. 167. and the thirteenth-century Wendover version Flores historiarum, Henry Murdac consecrated John, a Benedictine monk from Normandy, as Bishop of the Isles in 1152.Watt (1994) pp. 116–117; Giles (1849) p. 506; Coxe (1841) p. 250. The fact that the Chronicle of Mann fails to record John's name amongst other diocesan bishops appears to indicate that he was an unacceptable candidate to Óláfr and the Islesmen, and that John never occupied his see.Beuermann (2014) p. 93 n. 43; Woolf (2003) p. 174; Watt (1994) pp. 116–117; Anderson (1922) pp. 95–96 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114–115. Ecclesiastical and secular independence Ruinous Furness Abbey. Óláfr forged close connections with the monks of this Lancashire religious house, and granted them the right to elect his Bishop of the Isles. By way of his ecclesiastical actions, Óláfr firmly established the Diocese of the Isles to correspond to the territorial borders of his kingdom,Beuermann (2012) pp. 4–5; Bridgland (2004) p. 86; Beuermann (2002) pp. 425–426. and seems to have initiated the transfer the ecclesiastical obedience of the Isles from the Archdiocese of Canterbury to the Archdiocese of York. Such changes may have been orchestrated as a means to further distance his diocese from that of Dublin, where diocesan bishops were consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury.Beuermann (2002) pp. 425–428. In 1152, steps were undertaken by the papacy to elevate the Diocese of Dublin to an archdiocese. Dublin's political and economic ties with the Isles could have meant that the Bishop of the Isles was now in danger of becoming subordinate to the Archbishop of Dublin. For Óláfr, such an event would have threatened to undermine both his ecclesiastical authority and secular power within his own realm.Beuermann (2002) p. 428. As a result of Óláfr's inability to have Nicholas formally consecrated, and his refusal to accept John as bishop, the episcopal see of the Isles appears to have been vacant at the same time of Dublin's ecclesiastical ascendancy. In consequence, without a consecrated bishop of its own, Óláfr's diocese seems to have been in jeopardy of falling under Dublin's increasing authority.Beuermann (2002) pp. 428–429. Moreover, in 1152, David I attempted to have the dioceses of Orkney and the Isles included within the prospective Scottish Archdiocese of St Andrews.MacDonald (2013) p. 37. The name and title of Nicholas Breakspeare as they appear on folio 57v of AM 47 fol: \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 201 ch. 16; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). It may have been in the context of this ecclesiastical crisis in the Isles that Guðrøðr undertook his journey to Norway in 1152. Guðrøðr's overseas objective, therefore, may have been to secure the patronage of a Scandinavian metropolitan willing to protect the Diocese of the Isles.McDonald, RA (2012) p. 182 n. 175; Power (2005) p. 23; Beuermann (2002). Certainly, Guðrøðr's stay in Norway coincided with the Scandinavian visit of the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano,Power (2005) p. 23. a man who had been tasked to create Norwegian and Swedish ecclesiastical provinces in order to further extend the papacy's authority into the northern European periphery.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 163; Helle (2003) p. 376. Eventually the newly created Norwegian province—the Archdiocese of Niðaróss—encompassed eleven dioceses within and outwith mainland Norway. One such overseas diocese was that of the Isles,Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 167; Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 257; Helle (2003) p. 377; Orfield (2002) p. 135. officially incorporated within the province in November 1154.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 167 n. 57; Power (2005) p. 25; Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 257; Woolf (2003) p. 174; Watt (2000) pp. 11–12; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 229–230; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 8 § 1. Although Óláfr did not live long enough to witness the latter formality, it is evident that the remarkable overseas statecraft undertaken by Óláfr and Guðrøðr secured their kingdom's ecclesiastical and secular independence from nearby Dublin.Beuermann (2002) p. 432. The establishment of the Norwegian archdiocese bound outlying Norse territories closer to Norwegian royal power.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 165; Helle (2003) p. 377. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal subjection to far-off Norway—appears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.Davey, PJ (2006a); Davey, PJ (2006c). Kingship Tynwald Hill, near St John's may have been a national assembly site of the Kingdom of the Isles.Broderick (2003). It may well have been the place where the Islesmen publicly inaugurated their kings,Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 74–75. proclaimed new laws, and resolved disputes.Insley; Wilson (2006). Nevertheless, much of the visible site dates only to the eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth century. In some respects, Óláfr's kingship may be comparable to that of David I, a significant moderniser of the Scottish realm.Wolf (2014) pp. 80, 101; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 192, 221. Due to his time spent in England, Óláfr seems to have introduced modern forms of feudalism into his realm,Williams, DGE (1997) p. 262. and to have developed manorialism on Mann. Óláfr seems to have introduced the parochial system into the Isles;Wolf (2014) pp. 80–81; Macniven (2013) p. 83; Macniven (2006) pp. 177–178, 236, 251, 267, 269; Davey, P (2002) p. 91; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 54, 89. and like David I, Óláfr transformed the church within his realm, creating a territorially defined diocese.McDonald, RA (2016) pp. 342–343; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 66, 186, 187–188; Power (2005) p. 25; Beuermann (2002) pp. 425–426; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 208, 218. His establishment of a more modern territorial kingship, which came to be associated with its demesne on Mann, may have led to the alienation of outlying areas. Although climatic conditions in the Isles improved in the eleventh century, and agricultural production appears to have increased as a result, there appears to have been a decrease in manufacturing by the twelfth century.Hudson (2005) p. 203. Evidence of an eleventh-century mint on Mann exists prior to Guðrøðr Crovan's rule, but there is no evidence of one during Óláfr's reign, and no coins bearing the names of any of the members of his dynasty have been found.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 336; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 219; Hudson (2005) p. 203. The acclamation or election of a king was an important component of kingship in northern mediaeval Europe. There are several examples of the role played by chieftains in the kingship of the Isles during Óláfr's floruit.Crawford, BE (2014) p. 74; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 167–168. For instance, the leading men of the realm are recorded to have brokered the deal to have Muirchertach provide a regent until Óláfr was old enough to reign,McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 168; Anderson (1922) pp. 100–101; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 54–55. whilst disaffected chieftains are reported to have brought about the dramatic end of Ingimundr's regency,McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 168; Anderson (1922) p. 101; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 56–57. and chieftains are said to have accompanied Óláfr from England to begin his reign.Crawford, BE (2014) p. 74; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 168; Anderson (1922) p. 134; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. Even in the immediate aftermath of Óláfr's demise, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that the chieftains of the Isles (') gathered together and unanimously elected Guðrøðr as king.Crawford, BE (2014) p. 74; Abrams (2007) p. 182; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 168; Anderson (1922) p. 226; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65. The title of Óláfr's son and successor, Guðrøðr, as it appears on folio 40r British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\" (\\"King of the Isles\\").Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 78–79; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). There is surviving evidence of only twenty royal charters dating from the reign of the Crovan dynasty. Of these, only one dates to the reign of Óláfr.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 202. Óláfr styled himself ',McLeod (2002) p. 28 n. 11; Sellar (2000) pp. 191, 192 tab. i; Sellar (1997–1998). a Latin equivalent of a Gaelic title first accorded to his 10th century predecessor, Guðrøðr Haraldsson, King of the Isles.Sellar (2000) p. 189; The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 989.4; Clancy (2008) p. 26; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 989.4. Surviving sources indicate that Óláfr was the first of several kings from his dynasty to claim to rule ' (\\"by the grace of God\\").McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 165–166; Brownbill (1919) pp. 708–709 § 1; Oliver (1861) pp. 1–3; Beck (1844) p. 123; Document 1/13/1 (n.d.). The use of this formula was common amongst contemporary European monarchs but its use by the kings of the Isles, like the kings of Scotland, appears to have been adopted in imitation of the charters issued by the Angevin kings of England. Like the Scots, Óláfr and his successors appear to have adopted the formula to emphasise their sovereign right to kingship, to take their place amongst the leading monarchs of their time.McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 165–166. Óláfr's use of the formula exemplifies the fact that—in comparison to his royal predecessors in the Isles—he was a new kind of ruler and the real founder of later Manx kingship.Beuermann (2008); McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 66. The fact that Óláfr was brought up at the English royal court could suggest that he, like David I, was knighted by the English king.McDonald, RA (2016) pp. 340–341; Anderson (1908) pp. 155–156; Migne (1890) p. 621. Certainly, several of Óláfr's thirteenth-century royal successors were knighted by their English counterpart.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 340; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 215, 216–217. The name of Óláfr's daughter, Ragnhildr, as it appears on folio 143r of GKS 1005 fol (Flateyarbók): \\"'\\".Flateyjarbok (1862) p. 508 ch. 439; GKS 1005 Fol (n.d.). Ragnhildr married Somairle mac Gilla Brigte. Óláfr appears to have been an energetic king who consolidated his rule in the northern portion of the Isles by way of military force. There is reason to suspect that this region had fallen under Orcadian influence before being reclaimed by the Islesmen under Óláfr.Woolf (2004); p. 103; Woolf (2001). According to Hebridean tradition preserved by the seventeenth-century Sleat History, he was aided by Somairle in military operations (otherwise unrecorded in contemporary sources) against the \\"ancient Danes north of Ardnamurchan\\".Raven (2005) p. 55; Woolf (2004) p. 103; Macphail (1914) pp. 6–8. Together with its claim that Óláfr also campaigned on North Uist, this source may be evidence that the bitter struggle between Guðrøðr and Somairle (fought after Óláfr's demise) took place in the context of Somairle taking back territories that he had originally helped secure into Óláfr's kingdom. Somairle first emerges into the historical record in the 1130s supporting an unsuccessful rival branch of the Scottish royal family against David I. By about the time of Somairle's marriage to Óláfr's daughter, David I seems to have successfully imposed his authority over Argyll. As a result of this apparent overlorship, Somairle may have been encouraged to redirect his energies from Scotland into the Isles.Oram, R (2004) pp. 114–118. king gaming pieces of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 156 fig. 1g. There is reason to suspect that the Kingdom of the Isles lost control of territories in Galloway during Óláfr's floruit.Hudson (2005) p. 202; Woolf (2003) p. 180; Woolf (2001). Earlier in the mid eleventh century, the Rhinns of Galloway may have been ruled by Guðrøðr Crovan's predecessor, Echmarcach.Hudson (2005) pp. 129, 138. By the last years of the century, the region was ruled by Mac Congail, King of the Rhinns, who may have been a descendant of Guðrøðr Crovan's immediate predecessor, Fingal mac Gofraid. Whether Mac Congail ruled independently or subordinate to Guðrøðr Crovan is unknown.Hudson (2005) p. 172. The installation of Gilla Aldan as Bishop of Whithorn, in the third decade of the twelfth century, may mark the date when the Rhinns finally separated from the Kingdom of the Isles.Hudson (2005) p. 202; Woolf (2003) p. 180. Although support from the rulers of Galloway and Scotland may well have strengthened Óláfr's position in the Isles,Oram, RD (2011) pp. 103–104, 113. and the chronicle portrays his reign as one of peacefulness,Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Wadden (2014) pp. 31–32; Oram, RD (2011) p. 113; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 37, 54; Duffy (1993) p. 107; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 60–61. other sources vaguely recount the mainland depredations wrought by Wimund. The latter's warring against the Scots suggests that Óláfr may have struggled to maintain control of his far- flung kingdom.Oram, RD (2011) p. 113. The name and title of Ingi Haraldsson as they appear on folio 57v of AM 47 fol: \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 200 ch. 15; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). It is uncertain how the Diocese of the Isles was organised during Óláfr's reign. There may well have been several regional centres where diocesan bishops, accompanied by retinues of clerics and warriors, would have visited each successive region, living off the rendered tithes.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 176; Abrams (2007) p. 184; Woolf (2003) p. 180; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 347. In time however, the ecclesiastical endowments on Mann, commenced by Óláfr and further developed by his successors, would have reduced the need for such peripatetic diocesan bishops. As the kings of the Isles became more identified with their seat on Mann, so too were the bishops of the Isles, which may have resulted in the alienation of outlying areas.Woolf (2003) p. 180; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 347. The now-ruinous ecclesiastical site of Cille Donnain, near Loch Kildonan on South Uist, could well have been a bishop's seatFleming; Woolf (1992) p. 329. and twelfth-century power-centre in the Isles.Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 268; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 329. Its precise place in the organisation of the Isles is uncertain. Certainly, Lǫgmaðr is associated with the Uists by a particular verse of poetry, attributed to the contemporary skald Gísl Illugason, preserved by the early thirteenth-century Morkinskinna.Andersson; Gade (2012) p. 299 ch. 57; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 154; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 91–92, 92 n. 22; Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 348; Jónsson (1932) pp. 317–318; Vigfusson; Powell (1883) pp. 241–242; Unger (1867) p. 144; Gísl Magnkv 9II (n.d.). This contemporary composition could be evidence of a connection between him, or an associated bishop, with the Uist chain of islands. It is possible that, at a later date, the Cille Donnain site could have formed a residence for the peripatetic diocesan bishops of the Isles during their periodic visitations in the Uists.Fleming; Woolf (1992) p. 348. Death The name of Rǫgnvaldr Haraldsson, Óláfr's kin-slaying assassin, as it appears on folio 36r of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). The year 1153 was a watershed in the history of the Kingdom of the Isles. Not only did David I die late in May,Oram, RD (2011) p. 108. but Óláfr himself was assassinated about a month later on 29 June, whilst Guðrøðr was still absent in Norway.Oram, RD (2011) p. 113; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 67; Duffy (2004). According to the Chronicle of Mann, Óláfr had been confronted by three Dublin-based nephews—the Haraldssonar—the sons of his exiled brother, Haraldr. After hearing the demands of these men—that half of the kingdom should be handed over to them—a formal council was convened in which one of the Haraldssonar—a man named Rǫgnvaldr—approached Óláfr, raised his axe as if to salute the king, and decapitated him in a single stroke. In the resulting aftermath, the chronicle relates that the Haraldssonar partitioned the island amongst themselves.McDonald, RA (2019) pp. 65, 74; Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Downham (2013) p. 171, 171 n. 84; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67, 85, 92; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Beuermann (2002) p. 421; Duffy (2002b) p. 48; Sellar (2000) p. 191; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Duffy (1993) pp. 41–42, 42 n. 59; Oram, RD (1988) pp. 80–81; Anderson (1922) p. 225; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 62–65. Whether the men attained any form of authority in the rest of the Isles is unknown.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 74; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 92. Once in control of Mann, the chronicle reveals that the men fortified themselves against forces loyal to Guðrøðr, the kingdom's legitimate heir, by launching a preemptive strike against his maternal grandfather, Fergus.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 67; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Oram, RD (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) pp. 225–226; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65. Although the invasion of Galloway was repulsed with heavy casualties, once the Haraldssonar returned to Mann the chronicle records that they slaughtered and expelled all resident Gallovidians that they could find.Clancy (2008) p. 36; Davey, P (2002) p. 95; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Oram, RD (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) pp. 225–226; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65. This ruthless reaction evidently reveals an attempt to uproot local factions adhering to Guðrøðr and his mother.Oram, RD (1988) p. 81. rook gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6g, 185 fig. 12. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. Within months of his father's assassination, Guðrøðr executed his vengeance. According to the chronicle, he journeyed from Norway to Orkney, enstrengthened by Norwegian military support, and was unanimously acclaimed as king by the leading Islesmen. He is then stated to have continued on to Mann where he overcame his three kin-slaying cousins, putting one to death whilst blinding the other two, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.McDonald, RA (2019) p. 65; Crawford, BE (2014) p. 74; Downham (2013) p. 171; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 162; Oram, RD (2011) p. 113; Abrams (2007) p. 182; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 66; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67, 85; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Oram, RD (2000) pp. 69–70; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Gade (1994) p. 199; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Oram, RD (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) p. 226; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–67. Guðrøðr's reliance upon Norwegian assistance, instead of support from his maternal-grandfather, could suggest that the attack upon Galloway was more successful than the compiler of the chronicle cared to admit. Additionally, the account of incessant inter-dynastic strife amongst the ruling family of Galloway, recorded in the twelfth-century Vita Ailredi, suggests that Fergus may have struggled to maintain control of his lordship by the mid 1150s, and may also explain his failure to come to Guðrøðr's aid following Óláfr's death.Oram, RD (1988) pp. 81, 85–86; Powicke (1978) pp. 45–46. The fact that Óláfr sent Guðrøðr to Norway in 1152 could suggest there had been anxiety over the succession of the Kingdom of the Isles, and that Guðrøðr rendered homage to Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway in an effort secure assistance in safeguarding the kingship.Oram, RD (2011) p. 113; Beuermann (2002) pp. 421–422; Jennings (2001); Oram, RD (2000) p. 73; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 111; Power (1986) p. 131. The chronicle's account of Guðrøðr's return from Norway notes that he arrived with a fleet of five ships, which could indicate that overseas support was indeed obtained.Williams, DGE (1997) p. 111; Anderson (1922) p. 226; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 64–65. The earlier episode of conflict between Óláfr's elder brothers, his own slaying at the hands of his nephews, and the later internecine struggles endured by his descendants, reveal that competition for the kingship of the Isles was incredibly competitive and exceptionally violent.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 86. The turn to Ingi occurred at about the same time that Norwegian encroachment superseded roughly thirty years of Scottish influence in Orkney and Caithness,Oram, RD (2011) pp. 81–82, 113. and could be evidence of a perceived wane in Scottish royal authority in the first years of the 1150s. In November 1153, following the death of David I, Somairle seized the initiative and rose in revolt against the recently inaugurated Malcolm IV, King of Scotland. The dynastic challenges faced by Malcolm, and the ebb of Scottish influence in the Isles, may partly account for Guðrøðr's success in consolidating control of the kingdom, and may be perceptible in the seemingly more aggressive policy he pursued as king in comparison to his father. St Oran's Chapel, the oldest intact building on Iona, may have been built by Óláfr, his family, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, or the latter's family. Through Guðrøðr, Óláfr was the patrilineal-ancestor of later rulers of the Crovan dynasty, a kindred whose tenure of power in the Isles lasted until the second half of the thirteenth century. Through Ragnhildr, Óláfr was an important ancestor of the rulers of Clann Somairle, the descendants of Ragnhildr's husband Somairle. Whilst the union certainly testifies to Somairle's esteemed status,McDonald, RA (1997) p. 48. the key to his successful career may well have been the marriage itself.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 116; Woolf (2007) p. 165; Woolf (2005). In fact, the early rulers of Clann Somairle appear to have owed their claim to the kingship of the Isles by right of their genealogical link to Óláfr through Ragnhildr.Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Beuermann (2010) p. 102; Williams, G (2007) p. 145; Woolf (2005); Brown, M (2004) p. 70; Rixson (2001) p. 85. Although the burial place of Óláfr is unrecorded and unknown, by the second quarter of the thirteenth century Rushen Abbey appears to have filled the role of royal mausoleum for the Crovan dynasty.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 336; Davey, PJ (2008) p. 22 n. 44; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 49; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 82, 201. Guðrøðr was himself buried on Iona,McDonald, RA (2016) p. 343; Beuermann (2014) p. 91; Power (2013) p. 66; McDonald, RA (2012) pp. 153, 155; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 70, 201; Power (2005) p. 28; Duffy (2004). an island upon which the oldest intact building is St Oran's Chapel.Ritchie (1997) p. 101; Power (2013) p. 65; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 156; Power (2005) p. 28. Certain Irish influences in this building's architecture indicate that it dates to about the mid twelfth century.Power (2013) p. 65; Power (2005) p. 28; Ritchie (1997) p. 101. The chapel could well have been erected by Óláfr or Guðrøðr.McDonald, RA (2012) p. 156; Power (2005) p. 28. Certainly, their family's remarkable ecclesiastical activities during this period suggest that patronage of Iona is probable.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 343; McDonald, RA (2012) pp. 155–156.

He is the founder of the fashion and cosmetics company JOOP! as well as of fashion brand Wunderkind. He is the father of fashion and jewel designer Jette Joop and of writer and painter Florentine Joop.  Life and career  = Personal life = Wolfgang Joop was born in Potsdam to editor and author Gerhard Joop and his wife Charlotte. He grew up on his grandparents' farm in Bornstedt until 1954, when his family moved to Braunschweig, where his father had been hired as chief-editor of cultural magazine Westermanns Monatshefte. During the GDR period, Ulla Ebert, the sister of Joop's mother, lived in the property and was financially supported for its preservation by the family from the West. After the German reunification, Joop's parents moved back to Bornstedt. In 1970, Joop married Karin Benatzky, then an art student. They divorced in 1985. They have two daughters, Jette (born 1968) and Florentine (born 1973). Since separating from Benatzky, Joop has been in a relationship with Edwin Lemberg. They entered a civil union in 2013 in Potsdam, which only became known in 2017. = Studies and career beginnings = Coats from a fur collection by Wolfgang Joop (1979). After getting his Abitur in 1964 at the Wilhelm- Gymnasium in Braunschweig, Joop began studies in advertising psychology in 1966 at the Braunschweig University of Technology, which he did not finish. After dropping out, he worked as a restaurer. In 1968, he began studies in art education that he also did not finish. Joop began his career in 1970, when he took part to a competition by German women's magazine Constanze with his then- wife Karin Benatzky and they were awarded all three first prizes. This success landed him a job as fashion editor at the Hamburg-based women's magazine Neue Mode in 1970, from which he resigned in 1971 to continue working independently, including as a freelance journalist and designer. Joop achieved international success in 1978 with his first fur collection. In 1985, he was invited to become a guest lecturer of fashion design at the University of the Arts in Berlin. He was made honorary professor in 1987. = JOOP! = Wolfgang Joop in 1992. In early 1982, Wolfgang Joop presented his first prêt-à-porter women's collection, followed by his first men's collection in 1985. Two years later, with the launch of his first perfume collection, he made his name a trademark, with capital letters to symbolise energy along with an exclamation mark. Clothes, shoes, jewelry, eyeglasses, and perfume were immediately available under this brand. The \\"JOOP!\\" label became available for licensing, and Joop's company no longer produced any of its own goods for sale. Since 1997, Joop's products have been sold through JOOP! GmbH with the exception of Parfum JOOP!, which was sold to Coty/Lancaster in 1991 followed by licensee contracts. In 1998, Wolfgang Joop sold 95% of his JOOP! shares to Wünsche AG for 150 million deutsche Marks, but remained the brand's creative director. In 2001, he sold the remaining 5% and left the company. = Wunderkind = In 2003, Wolfgang Joop and his partner Edwin Lamberg founded the high-end couture fashion label Wunderkind. Joop first presented Wunderkind with the Fall/Winter collection 2003 in Potsdam to an audience of press and retail guests. Wunderkind made its international début in New York City in September 2004, when it was invited by the CFDA to premiere the collection at New York Fashion Week, and moved to Paris in 2006. Boutiques were opened in Berlin, London, and Sylt. In January 2011, it was reported that Wunderkind faced restructuring, with the dismissal of almost all its staff, and its March Paris Fashion Week show was cancelled. That same year, Joop designed the bridal gown worn by Princess Sophie of Isenburg for her marriage to Prince Georg of Prussia in August. After over a year of inactivity, Wunderkind presented a new show in Potsdam on May 10, 2012. A new general manager was put in place and there are plans to open another store in Berlin and for steady but slower growth.  Other activities  Independently from his labels, Wolfgang Joop released two men's perfumes in collaboration with Coty Prestige: Wolfgang Joop (2008) and Wolfgang Joop: Freigeist (2010). In the autumn of 2009, he began a collaboration with the Bayreuth-based healthcare company medi, for which he designed a series of high-priced compression stockings that he also presented at the Paris show of his label Wunderkind in late 2009. He worked with medi again in 2012. In October 2010, Joop became a creative consultant for Galeria Kaufhof. In September 2011, the collection \\"GALERIA 1879 by Wolfgang Joop\\", named after the founding year of the chain, was made available for sale in all Kaufhof stores. = Art = Wolfgang Joop has diverse interests and is involved in many activities beyond fashion and design, including illustration. Over 100 of his works are on show at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg. Since 2009, he has been selling some of his drawings through the gallery Lumas. He also creates sculptures, one of which can be found in the cemetery of Bornstedt. Joop also collects art, particularly contemporary paintings and sculptures, as well as furniture. = Authorship = Wolfgang Joop at the Frankfurt book fair in 2003. Wolfgang Joop has written several books, including the gift book Das kleine Herz (2001), the cookbook Hectic Cuisine (2002), the autobiography Stillstand des Flüchtigen (2002), the novel Im Wolfspelz (2003), and Wolfgang Joop, Wunderkind: 14467 Potsdam, published by Rolf Heyne Collection (2009). His second autobiography Undressed. Aus einem Leben mit mir (2013) was written in collaboration with journalist and author Rebecca Casati. He also authored numerous articles for publications such as Der Spiegel, Stern, and Welt am Sonntag. = Acting and television = Wolfgang Joop had a main role in Oskar Roehler's satirical film Suck My Dick (2001). He also had roles in various other films such as Tränen in Florenz (1984), Der Sommer des Samurai (1986), or Fahr zur Hölle Schwester (2002). In 2014 and 2015, he was a judge on Germany's Next Topmodel alongside Heidi Klum and Thomas Hayo. He also reappeared on the show as a guest judge in 2017 and 2018. = Social commitment = Wolfgang Joop supports the organisation Dunkelziffer e.

Guðrøðr was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles and Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Throughout his career, Guðrøðr battled rival claimants to the throne, permanently losing about half of his realm to a rival dynasty in the process. Although dethroned for nearly a decade, Guðrøðr clawed his way back to regain control of a partitioned kingdom, and proceeded to project power into Ireland. Although originally opposed to the English invasion of Ireland, Guðrøðr adeptly recognised the English ascendancy in the Irish Sea region and aligned himself with the English. All later kings of the Crovan dynasty descended from Guðrøðr. In the last year of his father's reign, Guðrøðr was absent at the court of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway, forging closer ties with the Kingdom of Norway. When Óláfr was assassinated by rival members of the Crovan dynasty in 1153, Guðrøðr returned to the Isles, overthrew his usurping cousins, and seized the throne for himself. Guðrøðr evidently pursued a more aggressive policy than his father, and the following year appears to have lent military assistance to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain in the latter's bid for the high-kingship of Ireland. Not long afterwards, Guðrøðr faced a dynastic challenge from his brother-in-law, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll, whose son, as a grandson of Óláfr, possessed a claim to the throne. Late in 1156, Guðrøðr and Somaile fought an inconclusive sea-battle and partitioned the kingdom of the Isles between them. Two years later Somairle stuck again and forced Guðrøðr from the Isles altogether. Guðrøðr appears to have spent his exile in the kingdoms of England and Scotland before journeying to Norway. In about 1161, Guðrøðr distinguished himself in the ongoing Norwegian civil wars at the final downfall of Ingi. Guðrøðr made his return to the Isles in 1164, in the aftermath of Somairle's defeat and death at the hands of the Scots. Although he regained the kingship itself, the territories ceded to Somairle in 1156 were retained by the latter's descendants. At some point in his career, Guðrøðr briefly held the kingship of Dublin. Although he was initially successful in fending off Muirchertach, the Dubliners eventually settled with the latter, and Guðrøðr returned to the Isles. This episode may have bearing on Guðrøðr's marriage to Findguala ingen Néill, Muirchertach's granddaughter. In 1170, Dublin fell to an Anglo-Irish alliance. The following year the ousted King of Dublin attempted to retake the town, and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht attempted to dislodge the English from Dublin. In both cases, Guðrøðr appears to have provided military assistance against the English. In succeeding years, however, Guðrøðr aligned himself with one of the most powerful English conquerors, John de Courcy. Guðrøðr's assistance to John, who had married Guðrøðr's daughter, Affrica, may have played a critical role in John's successful conquest of the Kingdom of Ulaid. Guðrøðr died in 1187 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Rǫgnvaldr. Although Guðrøðr may have attempted to avert any succession disputes between his descendants, Rǫgnvaldr and his younger brother, Óláfr svarti, eventually fought each other over the throne, and the resulting conflict carried on into later generations.

The men were members of the Crovan dynasty, a Norse-Gaelic kindred descended from Guðrøðr Crovan, King of Dublin and the Isles.McDonald (2007b) p. 27 tab. 1. Following Guðrøðr Crovan's death in 1095, there is a period of uncertainty in the history of the Kingdom of the Isles. Although the latter's eldest son, Lǫgmaðr, appears to have succeeded to the kingship, he was soon forced to contend with factions supporting his younger brothers: Haraldr, and Óláfr. Although he successfully dealt with Haraldr, foreign powers from Ireland intruded into the Isles, and Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway seized control of the kingdom. At some point, Óláfr was entrusted to the protection of Henry I, King of England, and spent his youth in England before his eventual restoration as King of the Isles in the second decade of the twelfth century. The thirteenth- to fourteenth- century Chronicle of Mann reveals that Guðrøðr's mother, Affraic, was a daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway.McDonald (2016) p. 342; Wadden (2014) pp. 31–32; McDonald (2012) p. 157; McDonald (2007b) pp. 66, 75, 154; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 60–61. Several contemporary sources concerning Fergus' descendants suggest that he was married to an illegitimate daughter of Henry I, and that this woman was the mother of at least some of his offspring, including Affraic herself.Oram (1988) pp. 71–72, 79. Although the union between Guðrøðr's parents is not dated in contemporary sources,Oram (1988) p. 79. it appears to have been arranged in the 1130s or 1140s. The marital alliance forged between Óláfr and Fergus gave the Crovan dynasty valuable familial-connections with the English Crown, one of the most powerful monarchies in western Europe.Oram (1993) p. 116; Oram (1988) p. 79. As for Fergus, the union bound Galloway more tightly to a neighbouring kingdom from which an invasion had been launched during the overlordsship of Magnús.Oram (1993) p. 116; Oram (1988) p. 80. The alliance with Óláfr also ensured Fergus the protection of one of Britain's most formidable fleets, and further gave him a valuable ally outwith the orbit of the Scottish Crown.Oram (1988) p. 80. Guðrøðr's name as it appears on folio 36r of British Library Cotton Julius A VII (the Chronicle of Mann): \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874) p. 62; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Another alliance involving Óláfr was that with Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll. Perhaps at about 1140, during a period when the latter was allied with David I, King of Scotland, Somairle married Ragnhildr, Óláfr's daughter. There is reason to suspect that the alliance was an after effect of the Scottish Crown's advancing overlordship.Oram (2011) pp. 86–89. The marriage itself had severe repercussions on the later history of the Isles, as it gave the Meic Somairle—the descendants of Somairle and Ragnhildr—a claim to the kingship through Ragnhildr's royal descent.Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Beuermann (2010) p. 102; Williams, G (2007) p. 145; Woolf (2005); Brown (2004) p. 70; Rixson (2001) p. 85. In the words of the chronicle, the union was \\"the cause of the collapse of the entire Kingdom of the Isles\\".McDonald (2019) pp. viii, 59, 62–63, 93; Wadden (2014) p. 32; McDonald (2007b) pp. 67, 116; McDonald (1997) p. 60; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 197; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 60–61. Early career king gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 156 fig. 1b, 163 fig. 8e. Comprising some four sets,Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 198. the pieces are thought to have been crafted in Norway in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries.McDonald (2012) pp. 168–169, 182 n. 175; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 165, 197. They were uncovered in Lewis in the early nineteenth century.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 155, 168–173. Some of the pieces may have arrived in the Isles as a result of Guðrøðr's return from Norway.McDonald (2012) p. 182 n. 175; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 178. Although the Chronicle of Mann portrays Óláfr's reign as one of tranquillity,Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Oram (2011) p. 113; Oram (2000) p. 73; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 60–61. a more accurate evaluation of his reign may be that he adeptly managed to navigate an uncertain political climate.Oram (2000) p. 73. By the mid part of the twelfth century, however, the ageing king's realm may well have begun to buckle under the strain,Oram (2011) p. 113; Oram (2000) p. 73. as perhaps evidenced by the depredations wrought on the Scottish mainland by Óláfr's leading ecclesiast, Wimund, Bishop of the Isles.Beuermann (2014) p. 93 n. 43; Oram (2011) p. 113. Confirmation of Óláfr's concern over the royal succession may well be preserved by the Chronicle of Mann,Oram (2011) p. 113; Beuermann (2002) pp. 421–422; Oram (2000) p. 73. which states that Guðrøðr journeyed to the court of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway in 1152, where Guðrøðr rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and seemingly secured recognition of the royal inheritance of the Isles.Rubin (2014) ch. 4 ¶ 18; Downham (2013) p. 172; McDonald (2012) p. 162; Oram (2011) p. 113; Beuermann (2010) pp. 106–107; Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 165; Hudson (2005) p. 198; Power (2005) p. 22; Beuermann (2002) p. 419, 419 n. 2; Jennings, AP (2001); Oram (2000) p. 73; Anderson (1922) p. 225; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 62–63. According to Robert's Chronica, the kings of the Isles owed the kings of Norway a tribute of ten gold marks upon the accession of a new Norwegian king. This statement could indicate that Guðrøðr rendered Ingi such a payment upon his visit to the Norwegian court in 1152.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 70–72; Hudson (2005) p. 198; Johnsen (1969) p. 20; Anderson (1908) p. 245; Lawrie (1910) p. 115 § 6; Howlett (1889) pp. 228–229. The following year marked a watershed in the history for the Kingdom of the Isles. For not only did David die late in May,Oram (2011) p. 108. but Óláfr himself was assassinated about a month later, on 29 June, whilst Guðrøðr was still absent in Norway.Oram (2011) p. 113; McDonald (2007b) p. 67; Duffy (2004b). According to the chronicle, Óláfr had been confronted by three Dublin-based nephews—the Haraldssonar—the sons of his exiled brother, Haraldr. After hearing the demands of these men—that half of the kingdom should be handed over to them—a formal council was convened in which one of the Haraldssonar slew Óláfr himself. In the resulting aftermath, the chronicle relates that the Haraldssonar partitioned the island amongst themselves.McDonald (2019) pp. 65, 74; Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Downham (2013) p. 171, 171 n. 84; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2000) p. 191; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Duffy (1993) pp. 41–42, 42 n. 59; Duffy (1991) p. 60; Oram (1988) pp. 80–81; Anderson (1922) p. 225; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 62–65. Whether the men attained any form of authority in the rest of the Isles is unknown.McDonald (2019) p. 74; McDonald (2007b) p. 92. Once in control, the chronicle reveals that the men fortified themselves against forces loyal to Guðrøðr, the kingdom's legitimate heir, by launching a preemptive strike against his maternal grandfather, Fergus. Although the invasion of Galloway was repulsed with heavy casualties, once the Haraldssonar returned to Mann the chronicle records that they slaughtered and expelled all resident Gallovidians that they could find.Clancy (2008) p. 36; Davey, P (2002) p. 95; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Oram (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) pp. 225–226; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 64–65. This ruthless reaction evidently reveals an attempt to uproot local factions adhering to Guðrøðr and his mother.Oram (1988) p. 81. Within months of his father's assassination, Guðrøðr executed his vengeance. According to the chronicle, he journeyed from Norway to Orkney, enstrengthened by Norwegian military support, and was unanimously acclaimed as king by the leading Islesmen. He is then stated to have continued on to Mann where he overcame his three kin-slaying cousins, putting one to death whilst blinding the other two, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.McDonald (2019) p. 65; Crawford, BE (2014) p. 74; Downham (2013) p. 171; McDonald (2012) p. 162; Oram (2011) p. 113; Abrams (2007) p. 182; McDonald (2007a) p. 66; McDonald (2007b) pp. 67, 85; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Oram (2000) pp. 69–70; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Gade (1994) p. 199; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Oram (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) p. 226; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 64–67. Whether Guðrøðr succeeded to the throne in 1153McDonald (2007b) pp. 27 tab. 1, 58, 67, 85. or 1154 is uncertain.McDonald (2007a) p. 51; Duffy (2007) p. 3; Thornton (1996) p. 95; Duffy (1993) p. 42; Duffy (1992) p. 126. The chronicle itself states that he overcame the Haraldssonar in the autumn following their coup. Fourteenth- century depiction of Fergus, Lord of Galloway as he is depicted in Leiden University Library Letterkunde 191 (Roman van Ferguut). Guðrøðr's reliance upon Norwegian assistance, instead of support from his maternal-grandfather, could suggest that the attack upon Galloway was more successful than the compiler of the chronicle cared to admit. Additionally, the account of incessant inter-dynastic strife amongst the ruling family of Galloway, as recorded by the twelfth-century Vita Ailredi, suggests that Fergus may have struggled to maintain control of his lordship by the mid 1150s, and may also explain his failure to come to Guðrøðr's aid following Óláfr's death.Oram (1988) pp. 81, 85–86; Powicke (1978) pp. 45–46. Óláfr and Guðrøðr's turn to Ingi occurred at about the same time that Norwegian encroachment superseded roughly thirty years of Scottish influence in Orkney and Caithness,Oram (2011) pp. 81–82, 113. and could be evidence of a perceived wane in Scottish royal authority in the first years of the 1150s. In November 1153, following the death of David, Somairle seized the initiative and rose in revolt against the recently inaugurated Malcolm IV, King of Scotland. The dynastic-challenges faced by Malcolm, and the ebb of Scottish influence in the Isles, may partly account for Guðrøðr's success in consolidating control of the kingdom, and may be perceptible in the seemingly more aggressive policy he pursued as king in comparison to his father.Oram (2011) p. 113. Contested kingship Midway through the twelfth-century, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain pressed forth to claim to the high-kingship of Ireland, an office then held by the elderly Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht.Duffy (2007) p. 2; O'Byrne (2005a); O'Byrne (2005c); Pollock (2005) p. 14; Duffy (2004c). In 1154, the forces of Toirrdelbach and Muirchertach met in a major conflict fought off the Inishowen coast, in what was perhaps one of the greatest naval battles of the twelfth century.Wadden (2014) pp. 29–31; Oram (2011) pp. 113, 120; McDonald (2008) p. 134; Duffy (2007) p. 2; McDonald (2007a) p. 71; O'Byrne (2005a); O'Byrne (2005b); O'Byrne (2005c); Duffy (2004c); Griffin (2002) pp. 41–42; Oram (2000) p. 73; Duffy (1993) pp. 42–43; Duffy (1992) pp. 124–125. According to the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, Muirchertach's maritime forces were mercenaries drawn from Galloway, Arran, Kintyre, Mann, and \\"the territories of Scotland\\".Wadden (2014) pp. 18, 29–30, 30 n. 78; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1154.11; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1154.11; Oram (2011) pp. 113, 120; Clancy (2008) p. 34; McDonald (2008) p. 134; Butter (2007) p. 141, 141 n. 121; Duffy (2007) p. 2; McDonald (2007a) p. 71; Pollock (2005) p. 14; Oram (2000) p. 73; Simms (2000) p. 12; Duffy (1992) pp. 124–125. This record appears to be evidence that Guðrøðr, Fergus, and perhaps Somairle, provided ships to Muirchertach's cause.Wadden (2014) pp. 30–31; Oram (2011) pp. 113, 120; McDonald (2008) p. 134; Duffy (2007) p. 2; McDonald (2007a) p. 71; McDonald (2007b) p. 118. Although Toirrdelbach's forces obtained a narrow victory, his northern maritime power seems to have been virtually nullified by the severity of the contest,Griffin (2002) p. 42. and Muirchertach soon after marched on Dublin,Wadden (2014) p. 34; O'Byrne (2005a); Duffy (2004c); Griffin (2002) p. 42. gained overlordship over the Dubliners, and effectively secured himself the high-kingship of Ireland for himself.French (2015) p. 23; Duffy (2004c). Dubgall's name as it appears on folio 16v of British Library Cotton Domitian A VII (the Durham Liber vitae): \\"'\\".Stevenson (1841) p. 4; Cotton MS Domitian A VII (n.d.). The defeat of forces drawn from the Isles, and Muirchertach's subsequent spread of power into Dublin, may have had severe repercussions concerning Guðrøðr's career.Oram (2011) pp. 113–114, 120. In 1155 or 1156, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Somairle conducted a coup against Guðrøðr, specifying that Þorfinnr Óttarsson, one of the leading men of the Isles, produced Somairle's son, Dubgall, as a replacement to Guðrøðr's rule.McDonald (2019) p. 47; Wadden (2014) p. 32; Downham (2013) p. 172; Woolf (2013) pp. 3–4; Oram (2011) p. 120; Williams, G (2007) pp. 143, 145–146; Woolf (2007) p. 80; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243–244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Rixson (2001) p. 85; Oram (2000) pp. 74, 76; McDonald (1997) pp. 52, 54–58; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 259–260, 260 n. 114; Duffy (1993) pp. 40–41; McDonald; McLean (1992) pp. 8–9, 12; Scott (1988) p. 40; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 231; Lawrie (1910) p. 20 § 13; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68–69. Somairle's stratagem does not appear to have received unanimous support, however, as the chronicle specifies that the leading Islesmen were made to render pledges and surrender hostages unto him, and that one such chieftain alerted Guðrøðr of Somairle's treachery.McDonald (1997) p. 58; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 9; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 231; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68–69.

Late in 1156, on the night of 5/6 January, Somairle and Guðrøðr finally clashed in a bloody but inconclusive sea-battle. According to the chronicle, Somairle's fleet numbered eighty ships, and when the fighting concluded, the feuding brothers-in-law divided the Kingdom of the Isles between themselves.McDonald (2019) pp. 32, 74; Caldwell (2016) p. 354; McDonald (2012) pp. 153, 161; Oram (2011) p. 120; McDonald (2007a) pp. 57, 64; McDonald (2007b) p. 92; Barrow (2006) pp. 143–144; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Oram (2000) p. 76; McDonald (1997) pp. 52, 56; Duffy (1993) p. 43; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 9; Scott (1988) p. 40; Rixson (1982) pp. 86–87; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) pp. 231–232; Lawrie (1910) p. 20 § 13; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68–69. Although the precise partitioning is unrecorded and uncertain, the allotment of lands seemingly held by Somairle's descendants in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries could be evidence that he and his son gained the southernmost islands of the Hebrides, whilst Guðrøðr retained the northernmost.McDonald (1997) p. 56. Two years later the chronicle reveals that Somairle, with a fleet of fifty-three ships, attacked Mann and drove Guðrøðr from the kingship into exile.McDonald (2012) pp. 153, 161; Oram (2011) p. 121; McDonald (2007a) pp. 57, 64; McDonald (2007b) pp. 92, 113, 121 n. 86; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Oram (2000) p. 76; McDonald (1997) p. 56; Duffy (1993) p. 43; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 9; Rixson (1982) pp. 86–87, 151; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 239; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68–69. According to the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga, the contemporary Orcadian warlord Sveinn Ásleifarson had connections in the Isles, and overcame Somairle in battle at some point in the twelfth century. Although this source's account of Sveinn and Somairle is clearly somewhat garbled, it could be evidence that Sveinn aided Guðrøðr in his struggle against Somairle.McDonald (2012) pp. 159–161. With Guðrøðr gone, it appears that either Dubgall or Somairle became King of the Isles.McDonald (1997) p. 57. Although the young Dubgall may well have been the nominal monarch, the chronicle makes it clear that it was Somairle who possessed the real power.Oram (2011) p. 121. Certainly, Irish sources regarded Somairle as king by the end of his career. The reason why the Islesmen specifically sought Dubgall as their ruler instead of Somairle is unknown. Evidently, Somairle was somehow an unacceptable candidate,McDonald (1997) p. 57; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196. and it is possible that Ragnhildr's royal ancestry lent credibility to Dubgall that Somairle lacked himself.Oram (2000) p. 76; McDonald (1997) p. 57. Exile from the Isles Nineteenth-century facsimile of the charter of Kelso Abbey, witnessed by Guðrøðr whilst in exile in 1159. His name and title reads: \\"'\\".Liber S. Marie de Calchou (1846) pp. III–VII; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 38; Document 1/5/24 (n.d.). Contemporaneous sources reveal that, upon his expulsion, Guðrøðr attempted to garner royal support in England and Scotland. For example, the English Pipe rolls record that, in 1158, the sheriffs of Worcester and Gloucester received allowances for payments made to Guðrøðr for arms and equipment.McDonald (2016) p. 341; Oram (2011) p. 12; Stephenson (2008) p. 12; McDonald (2007b) p. 113; Oram (2000) p. 76; Johnsen (1969) p. 22; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196 n. 5; Anderson (1922) p. 246 n. 4; Bain (1881) p. 9 §§ 56, 60; Hunter (1844) pp. 155, 168; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 35. Guðrøðr may have arrived in England by way of Wales. The English Crown's recent use of naval forces off the Gwynedd coast, as well as Guðrøðr's own familial links with the king himself, may account for the Guðrøðr's attempts to secure English assistance.Oram (2000) p. 76. In any case, Guðrøðr was unable to gain Henry II's help, and the latter proceeded to busy himself in Normandy.Oram (2011) p. 121; Oram (2000) pp. 76–77. Guðrøðr next appears on record in Scotland, the following year, when he witnessed a charter of Malcolm to Kelso Abbey.Taylor (2016) p. 250; Oram (2011) p. 121; Beuermann (2008); McDonald (2007a) p. 57; McDonald (2007b) p. 113; Power (2005) p. 24; Oram (2000) p. 77; Barrow (1995) pp. 11–12; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 12 n. 5; Johnsen (1969) p. 22; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196 n. 5; Liber S. Marie de Calchou (1846) pp. III–VII; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 38; Document 1/5/24 (n.d.). The fact that the Scottish Crown had faced opposition from Somairle in 1153 could suggest that Malcolm was sympathetic to Guðrøðr's plight.Beuermann (2009); Beuermann (2008); McDonald (2007b) p. 113. Although the latter was certainly honourably treated by the Scots, as revealed by his prominent place amongst the charter's other witnesses, he was evidently unable to secure military support against Somairle.Oram (2011) pp. 121–122. The name of Fergus as it appears on folio 35v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 60–61; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). It is uncertain why Guðrøðr did not turn to his grandfather, Fergus, for aid. One possibility is that the defeat of the Gallovidian fleet in 1154 severely weakened the latter's position in Galloway. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that Galloway endured a bitter power struggle later that decade. According to the twelfth- to thirteenth-century Chronicle of Holyrood, Malcolm overcame certain \\"confederate enemies\\" in Galloway in 1160.Oram (2011) pp. 118–122; Oram (2000) p. 80; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 136–137, 136 n. 1, 189; Anderson (1922) p. 245. Although the exact identities of these opponents are unknown, it is possible that this source documents a Scottish victory over an alliance between Somairle and Fergus.Oram (2011) pp. 118–122. Before the end of the year, Fergus retired to Holyrood Abbey,Oram (2011) pp. 118–119; Oram (2000) p. 80. and Somairle came into the king's peace.MacInnes (2019) p. 135; MacDonald (2013) p. 30 n. 51; Woolf (2013) p. 5; Oram (2011) pp. 118–119; Beuermann (2008); McDonald (2007b) p. 113; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Oram (2000) p. 81; Barrow (1994). Although the concordat between the Scottish Crown and Somairle may have taken place after the Malcolm's subjugation of Somairle and Fergus, an alternate possibility is that the agreement was concluded in the context of Somairle having aided the Scots in their overthrow of Fergus.Woolf (2013) p. 5. Somairle's deal with Scottish Crown may also have been undertaken not only in an effort to ensure that his own authority in the Isles was recognised by Malcolm, but to limit any chance of Guðrøðr receiving future royal support from the Scots.Woolf (2013) pp. 5–6; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245. Nineteenth-century depiction of the forces of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway, at the Battle of Oslo in 1161.Storm (1899) p. 629.

In late 1160 or early 1161, Guðrøðr distinguished himself in the ongoing civil war in the Norwegian realm, as evidenced by Hákonar saga herðibreiðs within the thirteenth-century saga-compilation Heimskringla.Finlay; Faulkes (2015) pp. 228–229 ch. 17; McDonald (2012) p. 162; Hollander (2011) p. 784 ch. 17; Beuermann (2010) p. 112, 112 n. 43; McDonald (2007b) p. 113; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Power (2005) p. 24; Salvucci (2005) p. 182; Beuermann (2002) pp. 420–421 n. 8; Oram (2000) p. 77; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196 n. 5; Anderson (1922) pp. 248–249; Jónsson (1911) pp. 609–610 ch. 17; Storm (1899) pp. 629–630 ch. 17; Unger (1868) pp. 772–773 ch. 17; Laing (1844) pp. 293–294 ch. 17. The fact that the Icelandic annals allege that Guðrøðr assumed the kingship of the Isles in 1160 could be evidence that, whilst in Norway, Ingi formally recognised Guðrøðr as king in a public ceremony.Storm (1977) pp. 116 § iv, 322 § viii, 475 § x; Johnsen (1969) p. 22; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196 n. 5; Anderson (1922) p. 246; Vigfusson (1878) p. 360; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 516. There is reason to suspect that Guðrøðr's support of Ingi may have been undertaken in the context of fulfilling military obligations as a vassal.Beuermann (2010) p. 112. Be that as it may, Hákonar saga herðibreiðs reveals that Guðrøðr played an important part in Ingi's final downfall in battle at Oslo in 1161. Up until 1155, Ingi had shared the kingship with his brothers Sigurðr and Eysteinn. With both of these brothers dead by 1157, Ingi was forced to contend with Hákon Sigurðarson, who had been elected to the kingship within the year.Antonsson; Crumplin; Conti (2007) p. 202. In regard to Guðrøðr himself, the saga relates that during this final battle against Hákon, Guðrøðr, at the head of one thousand, five hundred men, went over to Hákon's side. Guðrøðr's decision to abandon his embattled overlord tipped the scales in favour of Hákon, and directly contributed to Ingi's defeat and death. The young Magnús Erlingsson was elected king after Ingi's death, and following the fall of Hákon,Ghosh (2011) p. 206. was crowned king in 1163/1164.Ghosh (2011) p. 206; Beuermann (2010) p. 112. It is likely that Guðrøðr was present at Magnús Erlingsson's coronation, and possible that Guðrøðr rendered homage to him as well.Beuermann (2002) p. 421 n. 10.

Somairle was slain in an unsuccessful invasion of mainland Scotland in 1164.Jennings, A (2017) p. 121; Oram (2011) p. 128; McDonald (2007a) p. 57; McDonald (2007b) pp. 54, 67–68, 85, 111–113; Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 189; Duffy (1999) p. 356; McDonald (1997) pp. 61–62; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150; Duffy (1993) p. 31; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 197. The declaration in the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, of Somairle's forces being drawn from Argyll, Kintyre, Dublin, and the Isles, reveals the climax of Somairle's authority and further confirms his usurpation of power from Guðrøðr.The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1164.4; Oram (2011) p. 128; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1164.4; Oram (2000) p. 76; Duffy (1999) p. 356; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 197; Anderson (1922) pp. 253–254. Despite the record preserved by the Icelandic annals—that Guðrøðr regained the kingship of the Isles in 1160—it appears that Guðrøðr made his actual return to the region after Somairle's fall.Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 196 n. 5. Although it is possible that Dubgall was able to secure power following his father's demise,Oram (2011) p. 128. it is evident from the Chronicle of Mann that the kingship was seized by Guðrøðr's brother, Rǫgnvaldr, before the end of the year.McDonald (2019) pp. 46, 48; Oram (2011) pp. 128–129; McDonald (2007b) pp. 67–68, 85; Anderson (1922) pp. 258–259; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 74–75. Almost immediately afterwards, Guðrøðr is said by the same source to have arrived on Mann, ruthlessly overpowered his brother, having him mutilated and blinded.Oram (2011) pp. 128–129; McDonald (2007a) p. 57; McDonald (2007b) pp. 67–68, 85; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150; Anderson (1922) pp. 258–259; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 74–75. Guðrøðr thereafter regained the kingship,McDonald (2007b) p. 85; Duffy (2004b). and the realm was divided between the Crovan dynasty and the Meic Somairle,Sellar (2004); McDonald (1997) pp. 70–71; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150. in a partitioning that stemmed from Somairle's strike against Guðrøðr in 1156.McDonald (1997) pp. 70–71; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 150, 260.

In an entry dated 1172, the chronicle states that Mann was invaded by a certain Ragnall mac Echmarcacha, a man who slaughtered a force of Manx coast-watchers before being slain himself in a later engagement on the island. Although the chronicle claims that Ragnall was of \\"royal stock\\",McDonald (2019) pp. 46, 48; McDonald (2007b) pp. 85–86, 85 n. 88; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150; Duffy (1993) p. 61, 61 n. 69; Anderson (1922) p. 305; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 76–79. his identity is otherwise uncertain. One possibility is that this man's final adventure was somehow related to the dramatic fall of Norse-Gaelic Dublin in the preceding years.McDonald (2007b) pp. 85–86. He could have possessed a connection with the former rulers of the town, as a distant relative of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles.Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 150, 260–261, 260 n. 121. Alternately, Ragnall's name could indicate that he was a member of the Meic Torcaill, a family that possessed royal power in Dublin as late as the English conquest, and evidently possessed some lands afterwards.Duffy (1993) p. 61. Another possibility is that Ragnall's attack was somehow related to events in northern Ireland, where the Meic Lochlainn lost hold of the Cenél nEógan kingship to Áed Méith Ua Néill. In fact, it is possible that the invader himself was a member of the Uí Catháin, a branch of the Uí Néill who were opponents of John de Courcy, Guðrøðr's English ally and son-in-law.Oram (2000) p. 105. Although the chronicle specifically dates Ragnall's invasion to 1172, the chronological placement of the passage positions it between events dating to 1176 and 1183.McDonald (2007b) p. 85 n. 88; Duffy (1993) p. 61, 61 n. 69. This could indicate that the incursion took place in the immediate aftermath of John's conquest of Ulaid in 1177. Therefore, it is conceivable that Ragnall embarked upon his invasion whilst Guðrøðr was absent from Mann assisting John in Ireland. King of Dublin knight gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen. For a brief duration of his career, Guðrøðr appears to have possessed the kingship of Dublin. The chronology of his rule is unclear, however, as surviving sources concerning this episode are somewhat contradictory.Duffy (2007) pp. 3–4; Oram (2000) pp. 74–75; Duffy (1993) p. 44; Duffy (1992) pp. 126–128. According to the Chronicle of Mann, the Dubliners invited Guðrøðr to rule over them as king in the third year of his reign in the Isles.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 145–146; Downham (2013) pp. 166, 171–172; McDonald (2008) p. 134; Duffy (2007) p. 3; McDonald (2007a) p. 52; Oram (2000) pp. 74–75; Duffy (1993) pp. 43–45; Duffy (1992) pp. 126–127; Duffy (1991) p. 67; Anderson (1922) p. 230–231; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 66–69. If correct, such an arrangement would have almost certainly provoked Muirchertach, the Dubliners' Irish overlord.Oram (2000) p. 75; Duffy (1992) p. 126. In fact, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach indeed took exception to such overtures, and marched on Dublin with a massive host before forming up at \\"'\\". Whilst in control of Dublin, Guðrøðr and the defending Dubliners are stated to have repulsed a force of three thousand horsemen under the command of a certain Osiblen. After the latter's fall, Muirchertach and his remaining host retired from the region. The chronicle's version of events appears to be corroborated by the Annals of Ulster. Unlike the previous source, however, this one dates the episode to 1162. Specifically, Muirchertach's forces are recorded to have devastated the Ostman lands of \\"'\\" before his host of horsemen were repulsed.The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1162.4; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1162.4; Duffy (2007) pp. 3–4; Oram (2000) p. 75; Duffy (1993) p. 44; Duffy (1992) p. 128. Despite the difference in their chronologies, both accounts refer to similar military campaigns, and the uncertain place names of \\"'\\" and \\"'\\" may well refer to nearby locations roughly in the Boyne Valley.Duffy (1993) p. 44; Duffy (1992) p. 128. Another source documenting the conflict is the Annals of the Four Masters. According this account preserved by this source, after Muirchertach's setback at Dublin and subsequent withdrawal in 1162, he left the forces of Leinster and Mide to campaign against the Dubliners. In time, the source states that a peace was concluded between the Irish and the Dubliners in which the latter rendered a tribute of one hundred forty ounces of gold to Muirchertach.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1162.11; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1162.11; Duffy (2007) p. 4; Oram (2000) p. 75; Duffy (1993) p. 44; Duffy (1992) p. 128. According to the Annals of Ulster, this peace was reached after Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster plundered Dublin and gained dominance over the inhabitants.The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1162.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1162.5; Duffy (1993) p. 45. The payment reveals that the Dubliners recognised Diarmait's overlord, Muirchertach, as their own overlord, which in turn suggests that the price for peace was Guðrøðr's removal from the kingship.Duffy (2007) p. 4; Duffy (1993) pp. 44–45; Duffy (1992) p. 128. queen gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 157 fig. 2a, 163 fig. 8d, 187 fig. 14. In the winter of 1176/1177, the chronicle reveals that Guðrøðr was formally married to Muirchertach's granddaughter, Findguala Nic Lochlainn, in a ceremony conducted under the auspices of the visiting papal legate, Vivian, Cardinal priest of St Stephen in Celio Monte.McDonald (2019) p. 64; McDonald (2016) p. 342; Beuermann (2014) p. 93, 93 n. 45; Wadden (2014) pp. 32–33; Downham (2013) p. 172, 172 n. 86; Flanagan (2010) p. 195, 195 n. 123; Duffy (2007) p. 4; McDonald (2007a) p. 52; McDonald (2007b) pp. 68, 71, 171, 185; Oram (2000) p. 109 n. 24; Watt (2000) p. 24; McDonald (1997) pp. 215–216; Duffy (1993) p. 58; Duffy (1992) p. 127 n. 166; Flanagan (1989) p. 103; Power (1986) p. 130; Flanagan (1977) p. 59; Anderson (1922) pp. 296–297; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 76–77; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) p. 247. The precise date when Guðrøðr and Findguala commenced their liaison is unknown,Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146; Duffy (1992) p. 128 n. 166. and the two could have been a couple for some time before their formal marriage.Pollock (2005) p. 16 n. 76. It is possible that the union was originally brokered as a compromise on Muirchertach's part, as a means to placate Guðrøðr for withdrawing from Dublin.Downham (2013) p. 172; Duffy (2007) p. 4. The demonstrable unreliability of the chronicle's chronology, and the apparent corroboration of events by the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Ulster, suggests that the Guðrøðr's adventure in Dublin date to about 1162. Such a date, however, appears to contradict the fact that Guðrøðr seems to have endured Norwegian exile in 1160/1161, and apparently only returned to the Isles in 1164.Oram (2000) pp. 74–75. If the chronicle's date is indeed correct, Guðrøðr's inability to incorporate Dublin into the Kingdom of the Isles could well have contributed to his loss of status to Somairle.Oram (2011) pp. 113–114, 120; Oram (2000) pp. 74–76. There may be reason to suspect that Guðrøðr's defeat to Somairle was partly enabled by an alliance between Muirchertach and Somairle.Oram (2000) p. 75; McDonald (1997) pp. 55–56. For example, Argyllmen formed part of the mercenary fleet utilised by Muirchertach in 1154,Duffy (2007) pp. 2–3; Pollock (2005) p. 14, 14 n. 69; Oram (2000) p. 75; Duffy (1999) p. 356; Duffy (1993) pp. 31, 42–43. and it is possible that the commander of the fleet, a certain Mac Scelling, was a relation of Somairle himself. If Muirchertach and Somairle were indeed allied at this point in time it may have meant that Guðrøðr faced a united front of opposition.Duffy (2007) p. 3; McDonald (1997) pp. 55–56; Duffy (1993) p. 43. If correct, it could also be possible that Þorfinnr participated in Somairle's insurrection as an agent of Muirchertach.McDonald (1997) pp. 55–56. On the other hand, the fact that Somairle and Muirchertach jostled over ecclesiastical affairs in the 1160s suggests that these two were in fact rivals.Oram (2011) p. 128; Oram (2000) p. 76. Furthermore, the fact that Þorfinnr may have been related to a previous King of Dublin could reveal that Þorfinnr himself was opposed to Muirchertach's foreign overlordship. If Guðrøðr's difficulties in Dublin indeed date to a period just before Somairle's coup, the cooperation of men like Þorfinnr could be evidence that Dubgall—on account of his mother's ancestry and his father's power—was advanced as a royal candidate in an effort to counter Muirchertach's overlordship of Dublin. Opposed to the English in Ireland seal of Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke.French (2015) p. 27; Simms (1998) p. 56. The device depicts a contemporary mounted knight and footsoldier. Later in his reign, Guðrøðr again involved himself in the affairs of Dublin.McDonald (2008) p. 134; Duffy (2007) p. 6; Duffy (2004b). In 1166, the slaying of Muirchertach meant that two men made bids for the high-kingship of Ireland: Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht and Diarmait.Flanagan (2004b); Flanagan (2004c). The latter had possessed the overlordship of Dublin since Muirchertach's actions there in 1162.Duffy (2007) pp. 4–5. Within the same year as Muirchertach's fall, however, Diarmait was overcome by Ruaidrí and his allies, and forced him from Ireland altogether. Although Ruaidrí thereupon gained the high-kingship for himself, Diarmait made his return the following year enstrengthened with English mercenaries, and reclaimed the core of his lands.Crooks (2005a); Flanagan (2004b). In 1170 even more English troops flocked to Diarmait's cause, including Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, who successfully stormed the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford.Flanagan (2004a); Flanagan (2004b); Duffy (1998) pp. 78–79; Duffy (1992) p. 131. Richard soon after married Diarmait's daughter, Aífe, and effectively became heir to kingship of Leinster and the overlordship of Dublin.Flanagan (2004a); Duffy (1998) pp. 78–79. Later that year, the combined forces of Diarmait and Richard marched on Dublin, and drove out the reigning Ascall mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin.Duffy (1998) p. 79; Duffy (1992) pp. 131–132. rook gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6c, 184 fig. 11, 189 fig. 16. According to the twelfth-century Expugnatio Hibernica, Ascall and many of the Dubliners managed to escape by fleeing to the \\"northern islands\\".Downham (2013) p. 157 n. 1; McDonald (2008) p. 135; Duffy (2007) p. 5; Duffy (2005b) p. 96; Purcell (2003–2004) p. 285; Duffy (1998) p. 79; Duffy (1993) pp. 46, 60; Duffy (1992) p. 132; Wright; Forester; Hoare (1905) pp. 213–215 (§ 17); Dimock (1867) pp. 256–258 (§ 17). On one hand, this term could well refer to Orkney.Downham (2013) p. 157 n. 1. On the other hand, it is also possible that the term refers to the Hebrides or Mann.Duffy (2005b) p. 96; Duffy (1998) p. 79; Duffy (1992) p. 132, 132 n. 184. If so, this source would appear to be evidence that the Dubliners had retained close links with the Isles.Duffy (1992) p. 132, 132 n. 184. Whatever the case, within weeks of Diarmait's death early in May 1171, Ascall made his return to Dublin.Duffy (2007) p. 5; Duffy (1992) p. 132. The account of events recorded by Expugnatio Hibernica and the twelfth- to thirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande indicate that Ascall's forces consisted of heavily armoured Islesmen and Norwegians.Song of Dermot and the Earl (2011) pp. 165, 167 (§§ 2257–2272); McDonald (2008) pp. 135–136, 135–136 n. 24; Duffy (2007) p. 5; Song of Dermot and the Earl (2010) pp. 164, 166 (§§ 2257–2272); Duffy (1992) p. 132; Wright; Forester; Hoare (1905) pp. 219–221 (§ 21); Dimock (1867) pp. 263–265 (§ 21). The invasion itself was an utter failure, however, and Ascall himself was captured and executed.Duffy (2007) pp. 5–6; Purcell (2003–2004) p. 287; Duffy (1992) p. 132. Amongst the slain appears to have been Sveinn himself.McDonald (2012) p. 160; Barrett (2004). The successive deaths of Diarmait and Ascall left a power vacuum in Dublin that others sought to fill. Almost immediately after Ascall's fall, for example, Ruaidrí had the English-controlled town besieged.O'Byrne (2005) p. 469; Duffy (1992) p. 132. Expugnatio Hibernica records that he and Lorcán Ua Tuathail, Archbishop of Dublin sent for Guðrøðr, and others in the Isles, asking them to blockade Dublin by sea.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 145–146, 146 n. 80; Wyatt (2018) p. 797; Wyatt (2009) p. 391; McDonald (2008) pp. 134, 136; Duffy (2007) p. 6; McDonald (2007a) pp. 52, 63, 70; Pollock (2005) p. 15; Power (2005) p. 37; Purcell (2003–2004) p. 288, 288 n. 59; Gillingham (2000) p. 94; Duffy (1993) pp. 46–47, 59–60; Duffy (1992) pp. 132–133; Duffy (1991) p. 60; Wright; Forester; Hoare (1905) pp. 221–222 (§ 22); Dimock (1867) pp. 265–266 (§ 22). Whilst it is possible that Guðrøðr may have been enticed to assist the Irish through the promise of financial compensation, and perhaps the possession of any vessel his fleet captured in the operation, there is reason to suspect that the Islesmen were disquieted by prospect of permanent English authority in the region.Kostick (2013) ch. 6 ¶ 88. Certainly, Expugnatio Hibernica states that \\"the threat of English domination, inspired by the successes of the English, made the men of the Isles act all the more quickly, and with the wind in the north-west they immediately sailed about thirty ships full of warriors into the harbour of the Liffey\\". Although the operation was one of the greatest military mobilisations that the Irish mustered in the twelfth century, the blockade was ultimately a failure, and Dublin remained firmly in the hands of the English.Duffy (2007) p. 7; O'Byrne (2005) p. 469; Duffy (1993) p. 47; Duffy (1992) p. 133. Ascall was the last Norse-Gaelic King of Dublin;Downham (2013) p. 157. and before the end of the year, Clare relinquished possession of Dublin to his own liege lord, Henry II, King of England, who converted it into an English royal town.Duffy (2005b) p. 96; Flanagan (2004a); Simms (1998) p. 57. Aligned with the English in Ireland Mannequin of Guðrøðr's daughter, Affrica, at Carrickfergus Castle. The mannequin is looking through the window of the castle's great hall. According to the Chronicle of Northampton, Guðrøðr attended the coronation of Henry II's teenage son, Henry, in 1170.Strickland (2016) pp. 86, 357 n. 61. The participation of monarchs such as Guðrøðr and William I, King of Scotland in the ceremony partly illustrates the imperial aspect of the Plantagenet authority in the British Isles.Strickland (2016) p. 86. Guðrøðr's close relations with the English Crown may have revolved around ensuring royal protection from the English invaders of Ireland–especially considering his former control of Dublin.Strickland (2016) p. 357 n. 61. With the defeat of the Dubliners at the hands of English adventurers, and the ongoing entrenchment of the English throughout Ireland itself, the Crovan dynasty found itself surrounded by a threatening, rising new power in the Irish Sea zone.McDonald (2008) pp. 135–136; McDonald (2007a) p. 52; McDonald (2007b) pp. 124–125; Duffy (1992) p. 133; Duffy (1991) p. 60. Despite his original opposition to the English in Dublin, Guðrøðr did not take long to realign himself with this new power,McDonald (2008) p. 136; McDonald (2007b) p. 125. as exemplified through the marital alliance between his daughter, Affrica, and one of the most powerful incoming Englishmen, John de Courcy.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 145–146; Veach (2018) p. 167; McDonald (2008) p. 136; McDonald (2007b) p. 125; Duffy (2005a); Duffy (2004a); Oram (2000) p. 105; Power (1986) p. 130. In 1177, John led an invasion of Ulaid (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). He reached Down (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe, King of Ulaid, consolidated his conquest, and ruled with a certain amount of independence for about a quarter of a century.McDonald (2008) pp. 136–137; Crooks (2005b); Duffy (2005a); Duffy (2004a). Although the precise date of the marriage between John and Affrica is unknown,McDonald (2019) p. 60; McDonald (2007b) p. 126; Duffy (1995) p. 25, n. 167; Duffy (1993) p. 58. the union itself may well have attributed to his stunning successes in Ireland.McDonald (2008) pp. 137–138; McDonald (2007b) pp. 126–127; Duffy (1996) p. 7. Certainly, decades later in the reign of Guðrøðr's son and successor, Rǫgnvaldr, John received significant military support from the Crovan dynasty,McDonald (2008) p. 137; McDonald (2007b) pp. 126–127; Duffy (1995) p. 25; Duffy (1993) p. 58; Macdonald; McQuillan; Young (n.d.) pp. 10–12 §§ 2.5.8–2.5.10. and it is not improbable that Guðrøðr himself supplied similar assistance.McDonald (2008) p. 137; McDonald (2007b) pp. 126–127. In the 1190s, John also received military assistance from Guðrøðr's kinsman Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick. Like Guðrøðr, Donnchad was a grandson of Fergus,Wadden (2014) p. 37, 37 n. 107; Duffy (2005a); Pollock (2005) p. 18; Oram (2000) p. 105; Duffy (1995) p. 24; Duffy (1993) p. 73; Stubbs (1871) p. 25; Riley (1853) p. 404. and it possible that John's marriage to Affrica accounts for Donnchad's cooperation with him.Oram (2011) pp. 155–156; Pollock (2005) p. 18; Oram (2000) p. 105; Duffy (1993) pp. 72–73. The name of Guðrøðr's wife, Findguala Nic Lochlainn, as it appears on folio 40r of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874) p. 76; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Although the promise of maritime military support could well have motivated John to align himself with Guðrøðr,McDonald (2016) p. 338; Oram (2000) p. 105; Duffy (1995) pp. 25–26; Duffy (1993) p. 58; Davies (1990) p. 52; Power (1986) p. 130. there may have been a more significant aspect to their alliance.Duffy (1995) pp. 25–26. The rulers of Ulaid and those of Mann had a bitter past-history between them, and it is possible that the binding of John to the Crovan dynasty was actually the catalyst of his assault upon the Ulaid. In fact, Guðrøðr formalised his own marriage to Findguala in 1176/1177, and it was by this union that Guðrøðr bound his own dynasty with the Meic Lochlainn, another traditional foe of the Ulaid.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 145–146; McDonald (2008) pp. 137–138; McDonald (2007b) p. 127; Duffy (1995) pp. 25–26; Duffy (1993) pp. 58–59; Duffy (1991) pp. 67–68. Another contributing factor to the alliance between Guðrøðr and John may have been the Meic Lochlainn's loss of the Cenél nEógain kingship to the rival Uí Néill dynast Áed Méith in 1177. The latter certainly clashed with John before the end of the century, and the strife between the Uí Néill and Meic Lochlainn continued on for decades.Pollock (2005) p. 16. In any case, the unions meant that John was protected on his right flank by Guðrøðr, through whom John shared a common interest with the Meic Lochlainn, situated on his left flank.Martin (2008) p. 135. John would have almost certainly attempted to use such alignments to his advantage, whilst Guðrøðr may have used John's campaigning against the Ulaid as a means of settling old scores.McDonald (2007b) p. 127; Duffy (1991) pp. 67–68. The marriage alliance between Guðrøðr and John partly exemplifies the effect that the English conquest of Ireland had upon not only Irish politics but that of the Isles as well.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 145. Ecclesiastical activities The title of the Bishop of the Isles as it appears on folio 46v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 100–101; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). There is reason to regard Óláfr, like his Scottish counterpart David, as a reforming monarch.McDonald (2007b) pp. 66, 192; Davey, PJ (2006a); Woolf (2001). Guðrøðr continued Óláfr's modernising policies, as evidenced by surviving sources documenting the ecclesiastical history of the Isles.McDonald (2007b) p. 68. For example, Guðrøðr confirmed his father's charter to the abbey of St Mary of Furness, in which the monks of this Cistercian house were granted the right to select the Bishop of the Isles.Crawford, DKE (2016) p. 107; McDonald (2007b) pp. 68, 204; McIntire (1943) p. 5; Brownbill (1919) pp. 710–711 § 4; Oliver (1861) pp. 13–14; Document 1/14/1 (n.d.). Guðrøðr granted the English priory of St Bees the lands of \\"'\\" (Dhoon Glen) and \\"'\\" (Ballellin) in exchange for the church of St Óláfr and the lands of \\"'\\" (perhaps near Ballure).Beuermann (2014) p. 91; McDonald (2007b) pp. 68, 196; Duffy (1993) p. 57; McIntire (1943) p. 6; Wilson, J (1915) pp. 72–73 § 43; Document 1/14/2 (n.d.). In the reigns of Guðrøðr's succeeding sons, the Benedictine priory of St Bees continued to receive royal grants of Manx lands.McDonald (2007b) p. 196. The Chronicle of Mann reveals that Guðrøðr gave lands at Myroscough to the Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx in England. The chronicle also notes that a monastery was constructed on these lands, and that the lands eventually passed into the possession of the abbey of St Mary of Rushen.McDonald (2016) p. 343; Beuermann (2014) p. 93 n. 45; McDonald (2007b) p. 68; McDonald (1997) p. 218; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 76–77. Guðrøðr also granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of the monastery of Holm Cultram, another Cistercian house in England.Jamroziak (2011) p. 82; Jamroziak (2008) pp. 32–33; McDonald (2007b) pp. 68, 196, 219; Duffy (1993) p. 57; McIntire (1943) pp. 5–6; McIntire (1941) pp. 170–171; Grainger; Collingwood (1929) pp. 94–95 § 265a; Document 1/14/3 (n.d.). bishop gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 157 fig. 2i, 188 fig. 15, 192 tab. 5. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction within Guðrøðr's kingdom was the Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium.Woolf (2003) pp. 171, 180. Ecclesiastical interconnection between the Isles and Dublin seems to have been severed during a period of Irish overlordship of Dublin, at about the beginning of Guðrøðr Crovan's reign in the Isles.Woolf (2003) pp. 171–172. Before the midpoint of the twelfth century, Óláfr firmly established the Diocese of the Isles to correspond to the territorial borders of his kingdom,Beuermann (2012) pp. 4–5; Beuermann (2002) pp. 425–426. and seems to have initiated the transfer the ecclesiastical obedience of the Isles from the Archdiocese of Canterbury to Archdiocese of York. Such changes may have been orchestrated as a means to further distance his diocese from that of Dublin, where diocesan bishops were consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury.Beuermann (2002) pp. 425–428. In 1152, steps were undertaken by the papacy to elevate the Diocese of Dublin to an archdiocese. Dublin's political and economic ties with the Isles could have meant that the Bishop of the Isles was now in danger of becoming subordinate to the Archbishop of Dublin. For Óláfr, such an event would have threatened to undermine both his ecclesiastical authority and secular power within his own realm.Beuermann (2002) p. 428. As a result of Óláfr's inability to have an ecclesiast of his own choice formally consecrated as bishop, and his own refusal to accept one favoured by the Archbishop of York, the episcopal see of the Isles appears to have been vacant at the same time of Dublin's ecclesiastical ascendancy. In consequence, without a consecrated bishop of its own, Óláfr's diocese seems to have been in jeopardy of falling under Dublin's increasing authority.Beuermann (2002) pp. 428–429. Moreover, in 1152, David I attempted to have the dioceses of Orkney and the Isles included within the prospective Scottish Archdiocese of St Andrews.MacDonald (2013) p. 37. Extent of the Diocese of the Isles, c.1300.Watt (2003) p. 399 map 20.1; Woolf (2003) p. 177; Barrell (2002) p. xxiv map 3. It may have been in the context of this ecclesiastical crisis in the Isles that Guðrøðr undertook his journey to Norway in 1152. Guðrøðr's overseas objective, therefore, may have been to secure the patronage of a Scandinavian metropolitan willing to protect the Diocese of the Isles.McDonald (2012) p. 182 n. 175; Power (2005) p. 23; Beuermann (2002). Certainly, Guðrøðr's stay in Norway coincided with the Scandinavian visit of the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano,Power (2005) p. 23. a man who had been tasked to create Norwegian and Swedish ecclesiastical provinces in order to further extend the papacy's authority into the northern European periphery.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 163; Helle (2003) p. 376. Eventually the newly created Norwegian province—the Archdiocese of Niðaróss—encompassed eleven dioceses within and outwith mainland Norway. One such overseas diocese was that of the Isles,Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 167; Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 257; Helle (2003) p. 377; Orfield (2002) p. 135. officially incorporated within the province in November 1154.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 167 n. 57; Power (2005) p. 25; Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 257; Woolf (2003) p. 174; Watt (2000) pp. 11–12; Haddan; Stubbs (1873) pp. 229–230; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 8 § 1. Although Óláfr did not live long enough to witness the latter formality, it is evident that the remarkable overseas statecraft undertaken by Óláfr and Guðrøðr secured their kingdom's ecclesiastical and secular independence from nearby Dublin.Beuermann (2002) p. 432. The establishment of the Norwegian archdiocese bound outlying Norse territories closer to Norwegian royal power.Ekrem; Mortensen; Fisher (2006) p. 163; Helle (2003) p. 377. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal subjection to far-off Norway—appears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.Davey, PJ (2006a); Davey, PJ (2006b); Bartlett (1999) p. 823. The name of Gamaliel as it appears on folio 50v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874) p. 114; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Despite the ecclesiastical reorientation, the next Bishop of the Isles known from Manx sources was consecrated by Roger de Pont l'Evêque, Archbishop of York. This bishop, an Englishman named Gamaliel, may have been consecrated between October 1154 and early 1155, possibly before news of the diocesesan realignment reached the Isles.Woolf (2003) p. 174. Although it is possible that Gamaliel was consecrated without Guðrøðr's approval, the bishop appears to have witnessed at least one of the latter's charters.Watt (1994) p. 117. The fact that Gamaliel was buried in Peterborough could suggest that he was removed from his see at some point.Woolf (2003) pp. 174–175; Watt (1994) p. 117. The name of Reginald as it appears on folio 50v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"'\\". The next known bishop was Reginald, a Norwegian who witnessed the bitter struggles between Guðrøðr and Somairle, and who seems to have died in about 1170.Woolf (2003) p. 175; Watt (1994) pp. 117–118. It is possible that Reginald was consecrated in Norway in 1153/1154, and that the York-backed Gamaliel was compelled to resign the see to him.Beuermann (2002) p. 431. Reginald is the first Bishop of the Isles to be attested by the Icelandic annals, which could indicate that he was the first such bishop to recognise the authority of Niðaróss.McDonald (1997) p. 207. Either Gamaliel or Reginald could have been the unnamed Bishop of the Isles who is stated by Robert's Chronica to have met with William and Henry II at Mont St Michel.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 70–71; Watt (1994) pp. 117–118. Robert's account of the meeting indicates that the kings of the Isles were obligated to render tribute to newly crowned kings of Norway.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 70–72; Beuermann (2010) pp. 102–103, 103 n. 10, 106, 106 n. 32; McDonald (2007b) p. 135; Power (2005) p. 22, 22 n. 22; Anderson (1908) p. 245; Lawrie (1910) pp. 114–115 § 6; Howlett (1889) pp. 228–229. It is possible that Reginald followed Guðrøðr into exile after the latter's defeat to Somairle.MacDonald (2013) p. 32. Reginald's successor was Christian, an Argyllman who appears to have been appointed by Somairle or his sons.Beuermann (2014) p. 93; MacDonald (2013) pp. 31–32; Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Watt (1994) pp. 113, 118. The fact that Christian did not receive acknowledgement from the Archbishop of Niðaróss could be evidence that Reginald remained in Norway.MacDonald (2013) p. 32, 32 n. 56. The apparent antipathy between Guðrøðr and Christian may be evidenced by the fact that it was Silvan, Abbot of Rievaulx—and not Christian—who conducted the marriage ceremony of Guðrøðr and Findguala during Vivian's visit in 1176/1177.Beuermann (2014) p. 93. Death and descendants The ruins of Peel Castle and St German's Cathedral on St Patrick's Isle. The fact Guðrøðr and his son, Óláfr svarti, are recorded to have died on the islet could be evidence that it was the site of a royal residence.Freke (2002) p. 442; Freke (1990) p. 113. According to the Chronicle of Mann, Guðrøðr had four children: Affrica, Rǫgnvaldr, Ívarr, and Óláfr svarti.McDonald (2019) p. 77; McDonald (2007b) pp. 70, 123; Anderson (1922) pp. 313, 363–364; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 78–81. Although the chronicle specifically states that Findguala was Óláfr svarti's mother, and that he had been born before his parent's formalised marriage,McDonald (2019) p. 60; Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146; Flanagan (2010) p. 195 n. 123; McDonald (2007b) pp. 27 tab. 1; 71; Anderson (1922) pp. 296–297, 313–314; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 76–79. the mothers of the other three children are unknown or uncertain. According to the anonymous praise-poem Baile suthach síth Emhna, Rǫgnvaldr's mother was Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been a wife or concubine of Guðrøðr.McDonald (2019) p. 78; McDonald (2008) p. 134; McDonald (2007b) pp. 72–73; Duffy (2004d); Clancy; Márkus (1998) pp. 237, 239; Skene (1890) pp. 410–427. As for Ívarr, nothing further is recorded of him,McDonald (2019) p. 77; McDonald (2007b) p. 70. although it is possible that his mother was also the product of an uncanonical liaison.McDonald (2019) p. 77; McDonald (2007b) p. 71. During the twelfth century, the Church sought to emphasise the sanctity of marriage, and took steps to combat concubinage.Oram (1988) p. 100. As such, the record of Vivian's part in the marriage ceremony of Guðrøðr and Findguala may be evidence of an attempt by the papal representative to personally reinforce a stricter rule of marriage in the region.McDonald (2016) p. 342; McDonald (1997) pp. 215–216. In any case, there may be evidence to suggest that Guðrøðr had another son, Ruaidrí, who appears in a royal charter recorded as Rǫgnvaldr's brother (\\"'\\").McDonald (2016) p. 338; Valante (2010); McDonald (2007b) pp. 27 tab. 1; 75; Brownbill (1919) p. 711 § 5; Oliver (1861) pp. 17–18; Document 1/15/1 (n.d.). There is also reason to suspect that Guðrøðr had another daughter,Power (2005) p. 34 tab.; Anderson (1922) p. 467 n. 2 tab. as the Chronicle of Mann describes a thirteenth century Bishop of the Isles, a man named Reginald, to have been of royal birth,McDonald (2007b) pp. 78, 189; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 116–117. and to have been a sister-son of Óláfr svarti.McDonald (2007b) pp. 78, 190; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 84–85. Guðrøðr died on 10 November 1187 on St Patrick's Isle.McDonald (2007b) p. 70; Duffy (2004b); Freke (2002) p. 442. The fact that Guðrøðr and his son, Óláfr svarti, are recorded to have died on this islet could indicate that it was a royal residence.Crawford, DKE (2016) p. 105; Freke (2002) p. 442; Freke (1990) p. 113. In any case, the following year Guðrøðr was finally laid to rest on Iona, an island upon which the oldest intact building is St Oran's Chapel.Ritchie (1997) p. 101; Power (2013) p. 65; McDonald (2012) p. 156; Power (2005) p. 28. Certain Irish influences in this building's architecture indicate that it dates to about the mid twelfth century.Power (2013) p. 65; Power (2005) p. 28; Ritchie (1997) p. 101; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 249 § 12. The chapel could well have been erected by Óláfr or Guðrøðr. Certainly, their family's remarkable ecclesiastical activities during this period suggest that patronage of Iona is probable.McDonald (2016) p. 343; McDonald (2012) pp. 155–156. Upon Guðrøðr's death the chronicle claims that he left instructions for his younger son, Óláfr svarti, to succeed to the kingship since he had been born \\"in lawful wedlock\\".McDonald (2019) pp. 24, 66, 77; Beuermann (2014) p. 87; Oram (2011) pp. 156, 169; Flanagan (2010) p. 195 n. 123; McDonald (2007b) pp. 70–71, 94, 170; Duffy (2004d); Broderick (2003); Oram (2000) p. 105; Anderson (1922) pp. 313–314; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 78–79. On one hand, this record could be evidence that Guðrøðr continued to advance the institution of kingship in the Isles. For example, this episode appears to be the earliest record of a ruling member of the Crovan dynasty designating a royal successor. If so, such an arrangement may have been borne out of Guðrøðr's own bitter difficulties with rival claimants to the throne.McDonald (2019) p. 66; McDonald (2007b) pp. 68–69. On the other hand, it is uncertain if the chronicle has preserved an accurate account of events,Oram (2011) p. 156. as the Islesmen are stated to have chosen Rǫgnvaldr to rule instead, because unlike Óláfr svarti, who was only a child at the time, Rǫgnvaldr was a hardy young man fully capable to reign as king.McDonald (2019) pp. 24, 46, 48, 66, 77; Oram (2011) pp. 156, 169; Flanagan (2010) p. 195 n. 123; McDonald (2007b) pp. 70–71, 94, 170; Duffy (2004d); Oram (2000) pp. 105, 124; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 260; Anderson (1922) pp. 313–314; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 78–79. One possibility is that Guðrøðr may have intended for Rǫgnvaldr to temporarily rule as a lieutenant of sorts until Óláfr svarti was able to hold sway himself.Oram (2013). Although Rǫgnvaldr appears to have later forged an alliance with the Meic Somairle, and may have temporarily reunited the entire Kingdom of the Isles under his own leadership,Oram (2013); Woolf (2007) p. 81. he was later opposed by Óláfr svarti, and the ensuing violent conflict between Guðrøðr's descendants carried on to further generations.Beuermann (2014) p. 87; Oram (2013); Woolf (2007) pp. 80–81; McNamee (2005); Brown (2004) pp. 76–78; Duffy (2004d).

Maps have been one of the most important human inventions for millennia, allowing humans to explain and navigate their way through the world. The earliest archaeological maps include cave paintings, to ancient maps of Babylon, Greece, China, and India. In their most simple form maps are two dimensional constructs, however since the age of Classical Greece maps have also been projected onto a three-dimensional sphere known as a globe. In the 21st century, with the onset of the Information Age and the subsequenumnavigation of the Earth , the advent of the Atlas, the development of the Mercator Projection by German-Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator, (which was widely used as the standard projection of the earth up until the 20th century, when more accurate projections were formulated.)

However their efforts were unsuccessful and the knowledge of their discoveries was never widely circulated.)https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35935725 With the exponential increases in technology over the course of the Early Modern Age and the Information Age, the knowledge of the terrestrial earth has thus increased as well.

Earliest known maps Possibly the oldest surviving map has been engraved on this mammoth tusk, dated to 25,000 BC, found from Pavlov in the Czech Republic. The earliest known maps are of the stars, not the earth. Dots dating to 14,500 BC found on the walls of the Lascaux caves map out part of the night sky, including the three bright stars Vega, Deneb, and Altair (the Summer Triangle asterism), as well as the Pleiades star cluster. The Cuevas de El Castillo in Spain contain a dot map of the Corona Borealis constellation dating from 12,000 BC. Cave painting and rock carvings used simple visual elements that may have aided in recognizing landscape features, such as hills or dwellings. A map-like representation of a mountain, river, valleys and routes around Pavlov in the Czech Republic, carved on a mammoth tusk, has been dated to 25,000 BC, making it possibly the oldest known map of all time. The map etched on a mammoth bone at Mezhyrich is c.15,000 years old. A polished chunk of sandstone from a cave in Spanish Navarre, dated to 14,000 BC, may represent similar features superimposed on animal etchings, although it may also represent a spiritual landscape, or simple incisings. Another ancient picture that resembles a map was created in the late 7th millennium BC in Çatalhöyük, Anatolia, modern Turkey. This wall painting may represent a plan of this Neolithic village; however, recent scholarship has questioned the identification of this painting as a map. Ancient Near East Clay tablet with map of the Babylonian city of Nippur (ca. 1400 BC) Maps in Ancient Babylonia were made by using accurate surveying techniques. For example, a 7.6 × 6.8 cm clay tablet found in 1930 at Ga-Sur, near contemporary Kirkuk, shows a map of a river valley between two hills. Cuneiform inscriptions label the features on the map, including a plot of land described as 354 iku (12 hectares) that was owned by a person called Azala. Most scholars date the tablet to the 25th to 24th century BC; Leo Bagrow dissents with a date of 7000 BC. Hills are shown by overlapping semicircles, rivers by lines, and cities by circles. The map also is marked to show the cardinal directions. An engraved map from the Kassite period (14th–12th centuries BC) of Babylonian history shows walls and buildings in the holy city of Nippur. In contrast, the Babylonian World Map, the earliest surviving map of the world (c. 600 BC), is a symbolic, not a literal representation. It deliberately omits peoples such as the Persians and Egyptians, who were well known to the Babylonians. The area shown is depicted as a circular shape surrounded by water, which fits the religious image of the world in which the Babylonians believed. Examples of maps from ancient Egypt are quite rare. However, those that have survived show an emphasis on geometry and well-developed surveying techniques, perhaps stimulated by the need to re-establish the exact boundaries of properties after the annual Nile floods. The Turin Papyrus Map, dated c. 1160 BC, shows the mountains east of the Nile where gold and silver were mined, along with the location of the miners' shelters, wells, and the road network that linked the region with the mainland. Its originality can be seen in the map's inscriptions, its precise orientation, and the use of color. Phoenician sailors made major advances in seafaring and exploration. The first circumnavigation of Africa was undertaken by Phoenician explorers employed by Egyptian pharaoh Necho II c. 610–595 BC. In The Histories, written 431–425 BC, Herodotus cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed by Phoenician explorers during their circumnavigation of Africa (The Histories, 4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report, and even suggest the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the spherical Earth model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived. The historian Dmitri Panchenko theorizes that it was the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa that inspired the theory of a spherical Earth by the 5th century BC. Ancient Greece In reviewing the literature of early geography and early conceptions of the earth, all sources lead to Homer, who is considered by many (Strabo, Kish, and Dilke) as the founding father of Geography. Regardless of the doubts about Homer's existence, one thing is certain: he never was a mapmaker. The depiction of the Earth conceived by Homer, which was accepted by the early Greeks, represents a circular flat disk surrounded by a constantly moving stream of Ocean,Brown an idea which would be suggested by the appearance of the horizon as it is seen from a mountaintop or from a seacoast. Homer's knowledge of the Earth was very limited. He and his Greek contemporaries knew very little of the Earth beyond Egypt as far south as the Libyan desert, the south-west coast of Asia Minor, and the northern boundary of the Greek homeland. Furthermore, the coast of the Black Sea was only known through myths and legends that circulated during his time. In his poems there is no mention of Europe and Asia as geographical concepts.Thompson, 21 That is why the big part of Homer's world that is portrayed on this interpretive map represents lands that border on the Aegean Sea. It is worth noting that even though Greeks believed that they were in the middle of the earth, they also thought that the edges of the world's disk were inhabited by savage, monstrous barbarians and strange animals and monsters; Homer's Odyssey mentions a great many of them. Additional statements about ancient geography may be found in Hesiod's poems, probably written during the 8th century BC.Kirsh, 1 Through the lyrics of Works and Days and Theogony he shows to his contemporaries some definite geographical knowledge. He introduces the names of such rivers as Nile, Ister (Danube), the shores of the Bosporus, and the Euxine (Black Sea), the coast of Gaul, the island of Sicily, and a few other regions and rivers.Keane, 6–7 His advanced geographical knowledge not only had predated Greek colonial expansions, but also was used in the earliest Greek world maps, produced by Greek mapmakers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, and Ptolemy using both observations by explorers and a mathematical approach. Early steps in the development of intellectual thought in ancient Greece belonged to Ionians from their well- known city of Miletus in Asia Minor. Miletus was placed favourably to absorb aspects of Babylonian knowledge and to profit from the expanding commerce of the Mediterranean. The earliest ancient Greek who is said to have constructed a map of the world is Anaximander of Miletus (c. 611–546 BC), pupil of Thales. He believed that the earth was a cylindrical form, like a stone pillar and suspended in space. The inhabited part of his world was circular, disk-shaped, and presumably located on the upper surface of the cylinder. Anaximander was the first ancient Greek to draw a map of the known world. It is for this reason that he is considered by many to be the first mapmaker.Dilke A scarcity of archaeological and written evidence prevents us from giving any assessment of his map. What we may presume is that he portrayed land and sea in a map form. Unfortunately, any definite geographical knowledge that he included in his map is lost as well. Although the map has not survived, Hecataeus of Miletus (550–475 BC) produced another map fifty years later that he claimed was an improved version of the map of his illustrious predecessor. Hekatæus, 500 BC Hecatæus's map describes the earth as a circular plate with an encircling Ocean and Greece in the centre of the world. This was a very popular contemporary Greek worldview, derived originally from the Homeric poems. Also, similar to many other early maps in antiquity his map has no scale. As units of measurements, this map used \\"days of sailing\\" on the sea and \\"days of marching\\" on dry land.Goode, 2 The purpose of this map was to accompany Hecatæus's geographical work that was called Periodos Ges, or Journey Round the World. Periodos Ges was divided into two books, \\"Europe\\" and \\"Asia\\", with the latter including Libya, the name of which was an ancient term for all of the known Africa. The work follows the assumption of the author that the world was divided into two continents, Asia and Europe. He depicts the line between the Pillars of Hercules through the Bosporus, and the Don River as a boundary between the two. Hecatæus is the first known writer who thought that the Caspian flows into the circumference ocean—an idea that persisted long into the Hellenic period. He was particularly informative on the Black Sea, adding many geographic places that already were known to Greeks through the colonization process. To the north of the Danube, according to Hecatæus, were the Rhipæan (gusty) Mountains, beyond which lived the Hyperboreans—peoples of the far north. Hecatæus depicted the origin of the Nile River at the southern circumference ocean. His view of the Nile seems to have been that it came from the southern circumference ocean. This assumption helped Hecatæus solve the mystery of the annual flooding of the Nile. He believed that the waves of the ocean were a primary cause of this occurrence.Tozer, 63 It is worth mentioning that a similar map based upon one designed by Hecataeus was intended to aid political decision-making. According to Herodotus, it was engraved upon a bronze tablet and was carried to Sparta by Aristagoras during the revolt of the Ionian cities against Persian rule from 499 to 494 BC. Anaximenes, c. 500 BC Anaximenes of Miletus (6th century BC), who studied under Anaximander, rejected the views of his teacher regarding the shape of the earth and instead, he visualized the earth as a rectangular form supported by compressed air. Pythagoras of Samos (c. 560–480 BC) speculated about the notion of a spherical earth with a central fire at its core. He is sometimes incorrectly credited with the introduction of a model that divides a spherical earth into five zones: one hot, two temperate, and two cold—northern and southern. This idea, known as the zonal theory of climate, is more likely to have originated at the time of Aristotle. Scylax, a sailor, made a record of his Mediterranean voyages in c. 515 BC. This is the earliest known set of Greek periploi, or sailing instructions, which became the basis for many future mapmakers, especially in the medieval period. The way in which the geographical knowledge of the Greeks advanced from the previous assumptions of the Earth's shape was through Herodotus and his conceptual view of the world. This map also did not survive and many have speculated that it was never produced. A possible reconstruction of his map is displayed below. The world according to Herodotus, 440 BC Herodotus traveled very extensively, collecting information and documenting his findings in his books on Europe, Asia, and Libya. He also combined his knowledge with what he learned from the people he met. Herodotus wrote his Histories in the mid-5th century BC. Although his work was dedicated to the story of long struggle of the Greeks with the Persian Empire, Herodotus also included everything he knew about the geography, history, and peoples of the world. Thus, his work provides a detailed picture of the known world of the 5th century BC. Herodotus rejected the prevailing view of most 5th-century BC maps that the earth is a circular plate surrounded by Ocean. In his work he describes the earth as an irregular shape with oceans surrounding only Asia and Africa. He introduces names such as the Atlantic Sea, and the Erythrean Sea (which translates as the Red Sea). He also divided the world into three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. He depicted the boundary of Europe as the line from the Pillars of Hercules through the Bosphorus and the area between the Caspian Sea and the Indus River. He regarded the Nile as the boundary between Asia and Africa. He speculated that the extent of Europe was much greater than was assumed at the time and left Europe's shape to be determined by future research. In the case of Africa, he believed that, except for the small stretch of land in the vicinity of Suez, the continent was in fact surrounded by water. However, he definitely disagreed with his predecessors and contemporaries about its presumed circular shape. He based his theory on the story of Pharaoh Necho II, the ruler of Egypt between 609 and 594 BC, who had sent Phoenicians to circumnavigate Africa. Apparently, it took them three years, but they certainly did prove his idea. He speculated that the Nile River started as far west as the Ister River (Danube) in Europe and cut Africa through the middle. He was the first writer to assume that the Caspian Sea was separated from other seas and he recognised northern Scythia as one of the coldest inhabited lands in the world. Similar to his predecessors, Herodotus also made mistakes. He accepted a clear distinction between the civilized Greeks in the centre of the earth and the barbarians on the world's edges. In his Histories we can see very clearly that he believed that the world became stranger and stranger when one traveled away from Greece, until one reached the ends of the earth, where humans behaved as savages. While various previous Greek philosophers presumed the earth to be spherical, Aristotle (384–322 BC) is credited with proving the Earth's sphericity. His arguments may be summarized as follows: * The lunar eclipse is always circular * Ships seem to sink as they move away from view and pass the horizon * Some stars can be seen only from certain parts of the Earth. Hellenistic Mediterranean A vital contribution to mapping the reality of the world came with a scientific estimate of the circumference of the earth. This event has been described as the first scientific attempt to give geographical studies a mathematical basis. The man credited for this achievement was Eratosthenes (275–195 BC), a Greek scholar who lived in Hellenistic North Africa. As described by George Sarton, historian of science, \\"there was among them [Eratosthenes's contemporaries] a man of genius but as he was working in a new field they were too stupid to recognize him\\".Noble, 27 His work, including On the Measurement of the Earth and Geographica, has only survived in the writings of later philosophers such as Cleomedes and Strabo. He was a devoted geographer who set out to reform and perfect the map of the world. Eratosthenes argued that accurate mapping, even if in two dimensions only, depends upon the establishment of accurate linear measurements. He was the first to calculate the Earth's circumference (within 0.5 percent accuracy). His great achievement in the field of cartography was the use of a new technique of charting with meridians, his imaginary north–south lines, and parallels, his imaginary west–east lines. These axis lines were placed over the map of the earth with their origin in the city of Rhodes and divided the world into sectors. Then, Eratosthenes used these earth partitions to reference places on the map. He also divided Earth into five climatic regions which was proposed at least as early as the late sixth or early fifth century BC by Parmenides: a torrid zone across the middle, two frigid zones at extreme north and south, and two temperate bands in between. He was likely also the first person to use the word \\"geography\\". Roman Empire =Pomponius Mela= Reconstruction of Pomponius Mela's world map. Pomponius Mela is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence of antichthones, inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions from the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of Europe, Asia and Africa, he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from Alexander the Great (except Ptolemy) he regards the Caspian Sea as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea on the south. =Marinus of Tyre= Marinus of Tyre was a Hellenized Phoenician geographer and cartographer.“Notes on Ancient Times in Malaya” Roland Braddell. Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. 23, No. 3 (153) 1947 (1950), p. 9 He founded mathematical geography and provided the underpinnings of Ptolemy's influential Geographia. Marinus's geographical treatise is lost and known only from Ptolemy's remarks. He introduced improvements to the construction of maps and developed a system of nautical charts. His chief legacy is that he first assigned to each place a proper latitude and longitude. His zero meridian ran through the westernmost land known to him, the Isles of the Blessed around the location of the Canary or Cape Verde Islands. He used the parallel of Rhodes for measurements of latitude. Ptolemy mentions several revisions of Marinus's geographical work, which is often dated to 114 although this is uncertain. Marinus estimated a length of 180,000 stadia for the equator, roughly corresponding to a circumference of the Earth of 33,300 km, about 17% less than the actual value. He also carefully studied the works of his predecessors and the diaries of travelers. His maps were the first in the Roman Empire to show China. He also invented equirectangular projection, which is still used in map creation today. A few of Marinus's opinions are reported by Ptolemy. Marinus was of the opinion that the World Ocean was separated into an eastern and a western part by the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. He thought that the inhabited world stretched in latitude from Thule (Norway) to Agisymba (around the Tropic of Capricorn) and in longitude from the Isles of the Blessed (around the Canaries) to Shera (China). Marinus also coined the term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle. =Ptolemy= Ptolemy (90–168), a Hellenized Egyptian,George Sarton (1936). \\"The Unity and Diversity of the Mediterranean World\\", Osiris 2, p. 406–463 [429].John Horace Parry (1981). The Age of Reconnaissance, p. 10. University of California Press. . thought that, with the aid of astronomy and mathematics, the earth could be mapped very accurately. Ptolemy revolutionized the depiction of the spherical earth on a map by using perspective projection, and suggested precise methods for fixing the position of geographic features on its surface using a coordinate system with parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. Ptolemy's eight-volume atlas Geographia is a prototype of modern mapping and GIS. It included an index of place-names, with the latitude and longitude of each place to guide the search, scale, conventional signs with legends, and the practice of orienting maps so that north is at the top and east to the right of the map—an almost universal custom today. Yet with all his important innovations, however, Ptolemy was not infallible. His most important error was a miscalculation of the circumference of the earth. He believed that Eurasia covered 180° of the globe, which convinced Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic to look for a simpler and faster way to travel to India. Had Columbus known that the true figure was much greater, it is conceivable that he would never have set out on his momentous voyage. =Tabula Peutingeriana= The Roman Tabula Peutingeriana (5th century). In 2007, the Tabula Peutingeriana, a 12th-century replica of a 5th-century road map, was placed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register and displayed to the public for the first time. Although the scroll is well preserved and believed to be an accurate copy of an authentic original, it is on media that is now so delicate that it must be protected at all times from exposure to daylight. China The earliest known maps to have survived in China date to the 4th century BC. In 1986, seven ancient Chinese maps were found in an archeological excavation of a Qin State tomb in what is now Fangmatan, in the vicinity of Tianshui City, Gansu province. Before this find, the earliest extant maps that were known came from the Mawangdui Han tomb excavation in 1973, which found three maps on silk dated to the 2nd century BC in the early Han Dynasty. The 4th-century BC maps from the State of Qin were drawn with black ink on wooden blocks. These blocks fortunately survived in soaking conditions due to underground water that had seeped into the tomb; the quality of the wood had much to do with their survival. After two years of slow-drying techniques, the maps were fully restored. The territory shown in the seven Qin maps overlap each other. The maps display tributary river systems of the Jialing River in Sichuan province, in a total measured area of 107 by 68 km. The maps featured rectangular symbols encasing character names for the locations of administrative counties. Rivers and roads are displayed with similar line symbols; this makes interpreting the map somewhat difficult, although the labels of rivers placed in order of stream flow are helpful to modern day cartographers. These maps also feature locations where different types of timber can be gathered, while two of the maps state the distances in mileage to the timber sites. In light of this, these maps are perhaps the oldest economic maps in the world since they predate Strabo's economic maps. In addition to the seven maps on wooden blocks found at Tomb 1 of Fangmatan, a fragment of a paper map was found on the chest of the occupant of Tomb 5 of Fangmatan in 1986. This tomb is dated to the early Western Han, so the map dates to the early 2nd century BC. The map shows topographic features such as mountains, waterways and roads, and is thought to cover the area of the preceding Qin Kingdom. =Earliest geographical writing= In China, the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th century BC, during the beginning of the Warring States (481–221 BC). This was the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu chapter of the Shu Jing or Book of Documents. The book describes the traditional nine provinces, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly. The nine provinces in the time of this geographical work were very small in size compared to their modern Chinese counterparts. The Yu Gong's descriptions pertain to areas of the Yellow River, the lower valleys of the Yangzi, with the plain between them and the Shandong Peninsula, and to the west the most northern parts of the Wei River and the Han River were known (along with the southern parts of modern- day Shanxi province). =Earliest known reference to a map (圖 tú)= The oldest reference to a map in China comes from the 3rd century BC. This was the event of 227 BC where Crown Prince Dan of Yan had his assassin Jing Ke visit the court of the ruler of the State of Qin, who would become the first leader to unify China, Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC). Jing Ke was to present the ruler of Qin with a district map painted on a silk scroll, rolled up and held in a case where he hid his assassin's dagger. Handing to him the map of the designated territory was the first diplomatic act of submitting that district to Qin rule. Jing then tried and failed to kill him. From then on, maps were frequently mentioned in Chinese sources. =Han Dynasty= Western Han Dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD) silk map found in tomb 3 of Mawangdui Han tombs site, depicting the Kingdom of Changsha and Kingdom of Nanyue in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top, north at the bottom). The three Han Dynasty maps found at Mawangdui differ from the earlier Qin State maps. While the Qin maps place the cardinal direction of north at the top of the map, the Han maps are orientated with the southern direction at the top. The Han maps are also more complex, since they cover a much larger area, employ a large number of well-designed map symbols, and include additional information on local military sites and the local population. The Han maps also note measured distances between certain places, but a formal graduated scale and rectangular grid system for maps would not be used—or at least described in full—until the 3rd century (see Pei Xiu below). Among the three maps found at Mawangdui was a small map representing the tomb area where it was found, a larger topographical map showing the Han's borders along the subordinate Kingdom of Changsha and the Nanyue kingdom (of northern Vietnam and parts of modern Guangdong and Guangxi), and a map which marks the positions of Han military garrisons that were employed in an attack against Nanyue in 181 BC. An early text that mentioned maps was the Rites of Zhou. Although attributed to the era of the Zhou Dynasty, its first recorded appearance was in the libraries of Prince Liu De (c. 130 BC), and was compiled and commented on by Liu Xin in the 1st century AD. It outlined the use of maps that were made for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and even pinpointed locations of ores and minerals for mining facilities. Upon the investiture of three of his sons as feudal princes in 117 BC, Emperor Wu of Han had maps of the entire empire submitted to him. From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a geographical section (Diliji 地理纪), which was often an enormous compilation of changes in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, taxable products, etc. From the 5th century BC Shu Jing forward, Chinese geographical writing provided more concrete information and less legendary element. This example can be seen in the 4th chapter of the Huainanzi (Book of the Master of Huainan), compiled under the editorship of Prince Liu An in 139 BC during the Han Dynasty (202 BC–202 AD). The chapter gave general descriptions of topography in a systematic fashion, given visual aids by the use of maps (di tu) due to the efforts of Liu An and his associate Zuo Wu. In Chang Chu's Hua Yang Guo Chi (Historical Geography of Szechuan) of 347, not only rivers, trade routes, and various tribes were described, but it also wrote of a 'Ba June Tu Jing' ('Map of Szechuan'), which had been made much earlier in 150. Local mapmaking such as the one of Sichuan mentioned above, became a widespread tradition of Chinese geographical works by the 6th century, as noted in the bibliography of the Sui Shu. It is during this time of the Southern and Northern Dynasties that the Liang Dynasty (502–557) cartographers also began carving maps into stone steles (alongside the maps already drawn and painted on paper and silk). =Pei Xiu, the 'Ptolemy of China'= In the year 267, Pei Xiu (224–271) was appointed as the Minister of Works by Emperor Wu of Jin, the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty. Pei is best known for his work in cartography. Although map making and use of the grid existed in China before him, he was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Pei outlined six principles that should be observed when creating maps, two of which included the rectangular grid and the graduated scale for measuring distance. Western historians compare him to the Greek Ptolemy for his contributions in cartography. However, Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of earlier cartographic works by the inventor and official Zhang Heng (78–139) are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng. Later Chinese ideas about the quality of maps made during the Han Dynasty and before stem from the assessment given by Pei Xiu. Pei Xiu noted that the extant Han maps at his disposal were of little use since they featured too many inaccuracies and exaggerations in measured distance between locations. However, the Qin State maps and Mawangdui maps of the Han era were far superior in quality than those examined by Pei Xiu. It was not until the 20th century that Pei Xiu's 3rd-century assessment of earlier maps' dismal quality would be overturned and disproven. The Qin and Han maps did have a degree of accuracy in scale and pinpointed location, but the major improvement in Pei Xiu's work and that of his contemporaries was expressing topographical elevation on maps. =Sui= In the year 605, during the Sui Dynasty (581–618), the Commercial Commissioner Pei Ju (547–627) created a famous geometrically gridded map. In 610 Emperor Yang of Sui ordered government officials from throughout the empire to document in gazetteers the customs, products, and geographical features of their local areas and provinces, providing descriptive writing and drawing them all onto separate maps, which would be sent to the imperial secretariat in the capital city. = Tang = The Tang Dynasty (618–907) also had its fair share of cartographers, including the works of Xu Jingzong in 658, Wang Mingyuan in 661, and Wang Zhongsi in 747. Arguably the greatest geographer and cartographer of the Tang period was Jia Dan (730–805), whom Emperor Dezong of Tang entrusted in 785 to complete a map of China with her recently former inland colonies of Central Asia, the massive and detailed work completed in 801, called the Hai Nei Hua Yi Tu (Map of both Chinese and Barbarian Peoples within the (Four) Seas). The map was and in dimension, mapped out on a grid scale of equaling 100 li (unit) (the Chinese equivalent of the mile/kilometer). Jia Dan is also known for having described the Persian Gulf region with great detail, along with lighthouses that were erected at the mouth of the Persian Gulf by the medieval Iranians in the Abbasid period (refer to article on Tang Dynasty for more). =Song= The Yu Ji Tu, or Map of the Tracks of Yu Gong, carved into stone in 1137, located in the Stele Forest of Xian. This squared map features a graduated scale of 100 li for each rectangular grid. China's coastline and river systems are clearly defined and precisely pinpointed on the map. Yu Gong is in reference to the Chinese deity described in the geographical chapter of the Classic of History, dated 5th century BC. During the Song Dynasty (960–1279) Emperor Taizu of Song ordered Lu Duosun in 971 to update and 're-write all the Tu Jing in the world', which would seem to be a daunting task for one individual, who was sent out throughout the provinces to collect texts and as much data as possible. With the aid of Song Zhun, the massive work was completed in 1010, with some 1566 chapters. The later Song Shi historical text stated (Wade-Giles spelling): Like the earlier Liang Dynasty stone-stele maps (mentioned above), there were large and intricately carved stone stele maps of the Song period. For example, the squared stone stele map of an anonymous artist in 1137, following the grid scale of 100 li squared for each grid square. What is truly remarkable about this map is the incredibly precise detail of coastal outlines and river systems in China (refer to Needham's Volume 3, Plate LXXXI for an image). The map shows 500 settlements and a dozen rivers in China, and extends as far as Korea and India. On the reverse, a copy of a more ancient map uses grid coordinates in a scale of 1:1,500,000 and shows the coastline of China with great accuracy. The famous 11th-century scientist and polymath statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was also a geographer and cartographer. His largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen also created a three-dimensional raised- relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste, while representing the topography and specific locations of a frontier region to the imperial court. Shen Kuo's contemporary, Su Song (1020–1101), was a cartographer who created detailed maps in order to resolve a territorial border dispute between the Song Dynasty and the Liao Dynasty. =Yuan= In the Mongol Empire, the Mongol scholars with the Persian and Chinese cartographers or their foreign colleagues created maps, geographical compendium as well as travel accounts. Rashid-al-Din Hamadani described his geographical compendium, \\"Suvar al- aqalim\\", constituted volume four of the Collected chronicles of the Ilkhanate in Persia.Muginov-Persidkaya unikal'naya rukopis, pp.373 His works says about the borders of the seven climes (old world), rivers, major cities, places, climate, and Mongol yams (relay stations). The Great Khan Khubilai's ambassador and minister, Bolad, had helped Rashid's works in relation to the Mongols and Mongolia. Thanks to Pax Mongolica, the easterners and the westerners in Mongol dominions were able to gain access to one another's geographical materials. The Mongols required the nations they conquered to send geographical maps to the Mongol headquarters.Rashid/Boyle, pp.276 One of medieval Persian work written in northwest Iran can clarify the historical geography of Mongolia where Genghis Khan was born and united the Mongol and Turkic nomads as recorded in native sources, especially the Secret History of the Mongols. Map of relay stations, called \\"yam\\", and strategic points existed in the Yuan Dynasty. The Mongol cartography was enriched by traditions of ancient China and Iran which were now under the Mongols. Because the Yuan court often requested the western Mongol khanates to send their maps, the Yuan Dynasty was able to publish a map describing the whole Mongol world in c.1330. This is called \\"Hsi-pei pi ti-li tu\\". The map includes the Mongol dominions including 30 cities in Iran such as Ispahan and the Ilkhanid capital Soltaniyeh, and Russia (as \\"Orash\\") as well as their neighbors, e.g. Egypt and Syria. =Ming= The Da Ming Hun Yi Tu map, dating from about 1390, is in multicolour. The horizontal scale is 1:820,000 and the vertical scale is 1:1,060,000. The Da Ming hunyi tu map, dating from about 1390, is in multicolour. The horizontal scale is 1:820,000 and the vertical scale is 1:1,060,000. In 1579, Luo Hongxian published the Guang Yutu atlas, including more than 40 maps, a grid system, and a systematic way of representing major landmarks such as mountains, rivers, roads and borders. The Guang Yutu incorporates the discoveries of naval explorer Zheng He's 15th-century voyages along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, India and Africa. The Mao Kun map published in 1628 is thought to be based on a strip map dated to the voyages of Zheng He. = Qing = From the 16th and 17th centuries, several examples survive of maps focused on cultural information. Gridlines are not used on either Yu Shi's Gujin xingsheng zhi tu (1555) or Zhang Huang's Tushu bian (1613); instead, illustrations and annotations show mythical places, exotic foreign peoples, administrative changes and the deeds of historic and legendary heroes. Also in the 17th century, an edition of a possible Tang Dynasty map shows clear topographical contour lines. Although topographic features were part of maps in China for centuries, a Fujian county official Ye Chunji (1532–1595) was the first to base county maps using on-site topographical surveying and observations. The Korean-made Kangnido is based on two Chinese maps and describes the Old World. =Modern (PRC)= After the 1949 revolution, the Institute of Geography under the aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences became responsible for official cartography and emulated the Soviet model of geography throughout the 1950s. With its emphasis on fieldwork, sound knowledge of the physical environment and the interrelation between physical and economic geography, the Russian influence counterbalanced the many pre-liberation Western-trained Chinese geography specialists who were more interested in the historical and culture aspects of cartography. As a consequence, China's main geographical journal, the Dili Xuebao (地理学报) featured many articles by Soviet geographers. As Soviet influence waned in the 1960s, geographic activity continued as part of the process of modernisation until it came to a stop with the 1967 Cultural Revolution. India The pundit (explorer) cartographer Nain Singh Rawat (19th century) received a Royal Geographical Society gold medal in 1876. Indian cartographic traditions covered the locations of the Pole star and other constellations of use. These charts may have been in use by the beginning of the Common Era for purposes of navigation. Detailed maps of considerable length describing the locations of settlements, sea shores, rivers, and mountains were also made. The 8th-century scholar Bhavabhuti conceived paintings which indicated geographical regions. Italian scholar Francesco Lorenzo Pullè reproduced a number of ancient Indian maps in his magnum opus La Cartografia Antica dell'India. Out of these maps, two have been reproduced using a manuscript of Lokaprakasa, originally compiled by the polymath Ksemendra (Kashmir, 11th century), as a source. The other manuscript, used as a source by Pullè, is titled Samgrahani. The early volumes of the Encyclopædia Britannica also described cartographic charts made by the Dravidian people of India. Maps from the Ain-e-Akbari, a Mughal document detailing India's history and traditions, contain references to locations indicated in earlier Indian cartographic traditions. Another map describing the kingdom of Nepal, four feet in length and about two and a half feet in breadth, was presented to Warren Hastings. In this map the mountains were elevated above the surface, and several geographical elements were indicated in different colors. Islamic cartographic schools =Arab and Persian cartography= Al-Masudi's world map (10th century) In the Middle Ages, Muslim scholars continued and advanced on the mapmaking traditions of earlier cultures. Most used Ptolemy's methods; but they also took advantage of what explorers and merchants learned in their travels across the Muslim world, from Spain to India to Africa, and beyond in trade relationships with China, and Russia. An important influence in the development of cartography was the patronage of the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun, who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of celestial meridian. Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs (mīl in Arabic) in comparison to the stadion used by Greeks. These efforts also enabled Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al-Mamun also commanded the production of a large map of the world, which has not survived,Edson and Savage-Smith (2004) though it is known that its map projection type was based on Marinus of Tyre rather than Ptolemy. Also in the 9th century, the Persian mathematician and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed spherical trigonometry and map projection methods in order to convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, this type of projection had been used in ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries. In the early 10th century, Abū Zayd al-Balkhī, originally from Balkh, founded the \\"Balkhī school\\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms. The \\"Balkhī school\\", which included geographers such as Estakhri, al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal, produced world atlases, each one featuring a world map and twenty regional maps. Suhrāb, a late 10th-century Muslim geographer, accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection. The earliest surviving rectangular coordinate map is dated to the 13th century and is attributed to Hamdallah al-Mustaqfi al-Qazwini, who based it on the work of Suhrāb. The orthogonal parallel lines were separated by one degree intervals, and the map was limited to Southwest Asia and Central Asia. The earliest surviving world maps based on a rectangular coordinate grid are attributed to al-Mustawfi in the 14th or 15th century (who used invervals of ten degrees for the lines), and to Hafiz-i Abru (died 1430). Ibn Battuta (1304–1368?) wrote \\"Rihlah\\" (Travels) based on three decades of journeys, covering more than 120,000 km through northern Africa, southern Europe, and much of Asia. Regional cartography Islamic regional cartography is usually categorized into three groups: that produced by the \\"Balkhī school\\", the type devised by Muhammad al- Idrisi, and the type that are uniquely foundin the Book of curiosities. The maps by the Balkhī schools were defined by political, not longitudinal boundaries and covered only the Muslim world. In these maps the distances between various \\"stops\\" (cities or rivers) were equalized. The only shapes used in designs were verticals, horizontals, 90-degree angles, and arcs of circles; unnecessary geographical details were eliminated. This approach is similar to that used in subway maps, most notable used in the \\"London Underground Tube Map\\" in 1931 by Harry Beck. Al-Idrīsī defined his maps differently. He considered the extent of the known world to be 160° in longitude, and divided the region into ten parts, each 16° wide. In terms of latitude, he portioned the known world into seven 'climes', determined by the length of the longest day. In his maps, many dominant geographical features can be found. Book on the appearance of the Earth Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī's ' (\\"Book on the appearance of the Earth\\") was completed in 833. It is a revised and completed version of Ptolemy's Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction. Al-Khwārizmī, Al-Ma'mun's most famous geographer, corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate for the length of the Mediterranean Sea (from the Canary Islands to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean); Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of longitude, while al-Khwarizmi almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. Al-Ma'mun's geographers \\"also depicted the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as open bodies of water, not land-locked seas as Ptolemy had done. \\" Al-Khwarizmi thus set the Prime Meridian of the Old World at the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, 10–13 degrees to the east of Alexandria (the prime meridian previously set by Ptolemy) and 70 degrees to the west of Baghdad. Most medieval Muslim geographers continued to use al-Khwarizmi's prime meridian. Other prime meridians used were set by Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī and Habash al- Hasib al-Marwazi at Ujjain, a centre of Indian astronomy, and by another anonymous writer at Basra. Al-Biruni Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048) gave an estimate of 6,339.6 km for the Earth radius, which is only 17.15 km less than the modern value of 6,356.7523142 km (WGS84 polar radius \\"b\\"). In contrast to his predecessors who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Al-Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), Avicenna, p. 31, Routledge, . (cf. ) Al-Biruni's method's motivation was to avoid \\"walking across hot, dusty deserts\\" and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India (present day Pind Dadan Khan, Pakistan). From the top of the mountain, he sighted the dip angle which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), he applied to the law of sines formula. This was the earliest known use of dip angle and the earliest practical use of the law of sines. Around 1025, Al-Biruni was the first to describe a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere.David A. King (1996), \\"Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 1, p. 128–184 [153]. Routledge, London and New York. In his Codex Masudicus (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between Asia and Europe, or what is today known as the Americas. He deduced its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the Earth's circumference and Afro-Eurasia's size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference, and his discovery of the concept of specific gravity, from which he deduced that the geological processes that gave rise to Eurasia must've also given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that the landmass must be inhabited by human beings, which he deduced from his knowledge of humans inhabiting the broad north-south band stretching from Russia to South India and Sub-Saharan Africa, theorizing that the landmass would most likely lie along the same band. He was the first to predict \\"the existence of land to the east and west of Eurasia, which later on was discovered to be America and Japan\\". Tabula Rogeriana The Tabula Rogeriana, drawn by Muhammad al-Idrisi for Roger II of Sicily in 1154. Note that the north is at the bottom, and so the map appears \\"upside down\\" compared to modern cartographic conventions. The Arab geographer, Muhammad al-Idrisi, produced his medieval atlas, Tabula Rogeriana or The Recreation for Him Who Wishes to Travel Through the Countries, in 1154. He incorporated the knowledge of Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Far East gathered by Arab merchants and explorers with the information inherited from the classical geographers to create the most accurate map of the world in pre- modern times. With funding from Roger II of Sicily (1097–1154), al-Idrisi drew on the knowledge collected at the University of Cordoba and paid draftsmen to make journeys and map their routes. The book describes the earth as a sphere with a circumference of but maps it in 70 rectangular sections. Notable features include the correct dual sources of the Nile, the coast of Ghana and mentions of Norway. Climate zones were a chief organizational principle. A second and shortened copy from 1192 called Garden of Joys is known by scholars as the Little Idrisi. first World Map of Piri Reis (1513) showing parts of the Americas. On the work of al-Idrisi, S. P. Scott commented: Al-Idrisi's atlas, originally called the Nuzhat in Arabic, served as a major tool for Italian, Dutch and French mapmakers from the 16th century to the 18th century. =Piri Reis map of the Ottoman Empire= The Ottoman cartographer Piri Reis published navigational maps in his Kitab-ı Bahriye. The work includes an atlas of charts for small segments of the mediterranean, accompanied by sailing instructions covering the sea. In the second version of the work, he included a map of the Americas. The Piri Reis map drawn by the Ottoman cartographer Piri Reis in 1513, is one of the oldest surviving maps to show the Americas. Polynesian stick charts A chart of an unidentified area The Polynesian peoples who explored and settled the Pacific islands in the first two millennia AD used maps to navigate across large distances. A surviving map from the Marshall Islands uses sticks tied in a grid with palm strips representing wave and wind patterns, with shells attached to show the location of islands. Other maps were created as needed using temporary arrangements of stones or shells. Medieval Europe The Gough Map, a road map of 14th- century Britain The Fra Mauro map, a medieval European map, was made around 1450 by the Italian monk Fra Mauro. It is a circular world map drawn on parchment and set in a wooden frame, about two meters in diameter =Medieval maps and the Mappa Mundi= Map of the Holy Land, Pietro Vesconte, 1321. Described by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld as \\"the first non-Ptolemaic map of a definite country\\" Medieval maps of the world in Europe were mainly symbolic in form along the lines of the much earlier Babylonian World Map. Known as Mappa Mundi (cloths or charts of the world) these maps were circular or symmetrical cosmological diagrams representing the Earth's single land mass as disk-shaped and surrounded by ocean. =Italian cartography and the birth of portolan charts= Roger Bacon's investigations of map projections and the appearance of portolano and then portolan charts for plying the European trade routes were rare innovations of the period. The Majorcan school is contrasted with the contemporary Italian cartography school. The Carta Pisana portolan chart, made at the end of the 13th century (1275–1300), is the oldest surviving nautical chart (that is, not simply a map but a document showing accurate navigational directions). =Majorcan cartographic school and the \\"normal\\" portolan chart= Detail of Catalan Atlas, the first compass rose depicted on a map. Notice the Pole Star set on N. The Majorcan cartographic school was a predominantly Jewish cooperation of cartographers, cosmographers and navigational instrument-makers in late 13th to the 14th and 15th-century Majorca. With their multicultural heritage the Majorcan cartographic school experimented and developed unique cartographic techniques most dealing with the Mediterranean, as it can be seen in the Catalan Atlas. The Majorcan school was (co-)responsible for the invention (c.1300) of the \\"Normal Portolan chart\\". It was a contemporary superior, detailed nautical model chart, gridded by compass lines. Era of modern cartography =Iberian cartography in the Age of Discovery= In the Renaissance, with the renewed interest in classical works, maps became more like surveys once again, while the discovery of the Americas by Europeans and the subsequent effort to control and divide those lands revived interest in scientific mapping methods. Peter Whitfield, the author of several books on the history of maps, credits European mapmaking as a factor in the global spread of western power: \\"Men in Seville, Amsterdam or London had access to knowledge of America, Brazil, or India, while the native peoples knew only their own immediate environment\\" (Whitfield). Jordan Branch and his advisor, Steven Weber, propose that the power of large kingdoms and nation states of later history are an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Iberian powers (Kingdom of Spain and Kingdom of Portugal) were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia, in what became known as the Age of Discovery (also known as the Age of Exploration). Spain and Portugal were magnets for the talent, science and technology from the Italian city-states. Portugal's methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of Prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Soon, after Pedro Álvares Cabral reaching Brazil (1500), explorations proceed to Southeast Asia, having sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to Ming China and to Japan (1542). World Map by Juan de la Cosa (1500), the first map showing the Americas. In 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently found the Americas. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. The Spanish cartographer and explorer Juan de la Cosa sailed with Columbus. He created the first known cartographic representations showing both the Americas. The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), communicable disease, and ideas between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following the Voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas. The Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation was the first known voyage around the world in human history. It was a Spanish expedition that sailed from Seville in 1519 under the command of Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in search of a maritime path from the Americas to the East Asia across the Pacific Ocean. Following Magellan's death in Mactan (Philippines) in 1521, Juan Sebastián Elcano took command of the expedition, sailing to Borneo, the Spice Islands and back to Spain across the Indian Ocean, round the Cape of Good Hope and north along the west coast of Africa. They arrived in Spain three years after they left, in 1522. * ': Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel made the oldest known signed Portuguese nautical chart. * 1492: Cartographer Jorge de Aguiar made the oldest known signed and dated Portuguese nautical chart. * 1537: Much of Portuguese mathematician and cosmographer Pedro Nunes' work related to navigation. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a loxodrome. These lines, also called rhumb lines, maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection, also called navigator connection. In his Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart (1537), Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused, a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used. First maps of the Americas Nautical chart by Pedro Reinel (), one of the first based on astronomical observations and to depict a scale of latitudes. * 1500: The Spanish cartographer and explorer Juan de la Cosa created the first known cartographic representations showing both the Americas as well as Africa and Eurasia. * 1502: Unknown Portuguese cartographer made the Cantino planisphere, the first nautical chart to implicitly represent latitudes. * 1504: Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel made the oldest known nautical chart with a scale of latitudes. * 1519 : Portuguese cartographers Lopo Homem, Pedro Reinel and Jorge Reinel made the group of maps known today as the Miller Atlas or Lopo Homem – Reinéis Atlas. * 1530: Alonzo de Santa Cruz, Spanish cartographer, produced the first map of magnetic variations from true north. He believed it would be of use in finding the correct longitude. Santa Cruz also designed new nautical instruments,Alonso de Santa Cruz, cartógrafo y fabricante de instrumentos náuticos de la Casa de Contratación, Mariano Cuesta Domingo, Revista Complutense de Historia de América, Vol 30, pages 7–40, 2004. and was interested in navigational methods. Padrón Real of the Spanish Empire World Map by Diogo Ribeiro. The Spanish House of Trade, founded 1504 in Seville, had a large contingent of cartographers, as Spain's overseas empire expanded. The master map or Padrón Real was mandated by the Spanish monarch in 1508 and updated subsequently as more information became available with each ship returning to Seville.\\"Early Spanish Cartography in the New World.\\" American Antiquarian Society Proceedings, (n.s.) vol. 19(1909)369–419. Diogo Ribeiro, a Portuguese cartographer working for Spain, made what is considered the first scientific world map: the 1527 Padrón real. The layout of the map (Mapamundi) is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-Elcano trip around the world. Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of Central and South America. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the Pacific Ocean. It also shows, for the first time, the North American coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by the Esteban Gómez's exploration in 1525). It also shows the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas. Two prominent cosmographers (as mapmakers were then known) of the House of Trade were Alonso de Santa Cruz and Juan López de Velasco, who directed mapmaking under Philip II, without ever going to the New World. Their maps were based on information they received from returning navigators. Using repeatable principles that underpin mapmaking, their map making techniques could be employed anywhere. Philip II sought extensive information about his overseas empire, both in written textual form and in the production of maps.Barbara Mundy, The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1996, pp. 11–12. =German cartography= Martin Behaim's Erdapfel (1492) is considered to be the oldest surviving terrestrial globe. Waldseemüller wall map dated 1507, depicts the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean separating Asia from the Americas, by the Italian Amerigo Vespucci. * 15th century: The German monk Nicholas Germanus wrote a pioneering Cosmographia. He added the first new maps to Ptolemy's Geographica. Germanus invented the Donis map projection where parallels of latitude are made equidistant, but meridians converge toward the poles. * 1492: German merchant Martin Behaim (1459–1507) made the oldest surviving terrestrial globe, but it lacked the Americas. * 1507: German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller's World map (Waldseemüller map) was the first to use the term America for the Western continents (after explorer Amerigo Vespucci). * 1603: German Johann Bayer's star atlas (Uranometria) was published in Augsburg in 1603 and was the first atlas to cover the entire celestial sphere. =Netherlandish (Dutch and Flemish) schools= Blaeu's world map, originally prepared by Joan Blaeu for his Atlas Maior, published in the first book of the Atlas Van Loon (1664). Notable representatives of the Netherlandish school of cartography and geography (1500s–1600s) include: Franciscus Monachus, Gemma Frisius, Gaspard van der Heyden, Gerard Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, Christophe Plantin, Lucas Waghenaer, Jacob van Deventer, Willebrord Snell, Hessel Gerritsz, Petrus Plancius, Jodocus Hondius, Henricus Hondius II, Hendrik Hondius I, Willem Blaeu, Joan Blaeu, Johannes Janssonius, Andreas Cellarius, Gerard de Jode, Cornelis de Jode, Claes Visscher, Nicolaes Visscher I, Nicolaes Visscher II, and Frederik de Wit. Leuven, Antwerp, and Amsterdam were the main centres of the Netherlandish school of cartography in its golden age (the 16th and 17th centuries, approximately 1570–1670s). The Golden Age of Dutch cartography (also known as the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography) that was inaugurated in the Southern Netherlands (current Belgium; mainly in Leuven and Antwerp) by Mercator and Ortelius found its fullest expression during the seventeenth century with the production of monumental multi-volume world atlases in the Dutch Republic (mainly in Amsterdam) by competing mapmaking firms such as Lucas Waghenaer, Joan Blaeu, Jan Janssonius, Claes Janszoon Visscher, and Frederik de Wit.Carhart, George S.: Frederick de Wit and the First Concise Reference Atlas. (BRILL, 2016, ) Southern Netherlands Mercator map of the world. Gerardus Mercator, the German- NetherlandishSee the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#The question of nationality. cartographer and geographer with a vast output of wall maps, bound maps, globes and scientific instruments but his greatest legacy was the mathematical projection he devised for his 1569 world map. The Mercator projection is an example of a cylindrical projection in which the meridians are straight and perpendicular to the parallels. As a result, the map has a constant width and the parallels are stretched east–west as the poles are approached. Mercator's insight was to stretch the separation of the parallels in a way which exactly compensates for their increasing length, thus preserving shapes of small regions, albeit at the expense of global distortion. Such a conformal map projection necessarily transforms rhumb lines, sailing courses of a constant bearing, into straight lines on the map thus greatly facilitating navigation. That this was Mercator's intention is clear from the title: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata which translates as \\"New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation\\". Although the projection's adoption was slow, by the end of the seventeenth century it was in use for naval charts throughout the world and remains so to the present day. Its later adoption as the all-purpose world map was an unfortunate step.See the discussion in Mercator projection#Uses Mercator spent the last thirty years of his life working on a vast project, the Cosmographia;See the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#Duisburg 1552–1594 a description of the whole universe including the creation and a description of the topography, history and institutions of all countries. The word atlas makes its first appearance in the title of the final volume: \\"Atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura\\".See the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#atlas1595. This translates as Atlas OR cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created, thus providing Mercator's definition of the term atlas. These volumes devote slightly less than one half of their pages to maps: Mercator did not use the term solely to describe a bound collection of maps. His choice of title was motivated by his respect for Atlas \\"King of Mauretania\\"See the preface to the 1595 posthumous section of Mercator's atlas as translated in , pp34–38 (PDF pp103–108) World map Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Ortelius (1570). The period of late 16th and much of the 17th century (approximately 1570–1670s) has been called the \\"Golden Age of Dutch and Flemish cartography\\" (also known as the \\"Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography\\"). Abraham Ortelius generally recognized as the creator of the world's first modern atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World). Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570) is considered the first true atlas in the modern sense: a collection of uniform map sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. It is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century cartography.Thrower, Norman J. W. (2008).

The Grapes of Math: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life, p. 74 Dutch cartographer Jacob van Deventer was among the first to make systematic use of triangulation, the technique whose theory was described by Gemma Frisius in his 1533 book. The modern systematic use of triangulation networks stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom, approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all.Kirby, Richard Shelton et al.

Snell's methods were taken up by Jean Picard who in 1669–70 surveyed one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using a chain of thirteen triangles stretching north from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. Waghenaer (1584). The publication of Waghenaer's De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt (1584) is widely considered as one of the most important developments in the history of nautical cartography. The first printed atlas of nautical charts (De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt or The Mirror of Navigation / The Mariner's Mirror) was produced by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer in Leiden in 1584. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify nautical maps. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and sailing directions with instructions for navigation on the western and north-western coastal waters of Europe. It was the first of its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a \\"waggoner\\" (an atlas book of engraved nautical charts with accompanying printed sailing directions), the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.Struik, Dirk J.

These 12 newly Dutch-created southern constellations (that including Apus, Chamaeleon, Dorado, Grus, Hydrus, Indus, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana and Volans) first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597/1598 in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographers Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of these constellations in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. In 1660, German-born Dutch cartographer Andreas Cellarius' star atlas (Harmonia Macrocosmica) was published by Johannes Janssonius in Amsterdam. A typical map from the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. Australasia during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s) including: Nova Guinea (New Guinea), Nova Hollandia (mainland Australia), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and Nova Zeelandia (New Zealand). The Dutch dominated the commercial cartography (corporate cartography) during the seventeenth century through the publicly traded companies (such as the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company) and the competing privately held map-making houses/firms. In the book Capitalism and Cartography in the Dutch Golden Age (University of Chicago Press, 2015), Elizabeth A. Sutton explores the fascinating but previously neglected history of corporate (commercial) cartography during the Dutch Golden Age, from ca. 1600 to 1650. Maps were used as propaganda tools for both the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC) in order to encourage the commodification of land and an overall capitalist agenda. In the long run the competition between map-making firms Blaeu and Janssonius resulted in the publication of an 'Atlas Maior' or 'Major Atlas'. In 1662 the Latin edition of Joan Blaeu's Atlas Maior appeared in eleven volumes and with approximately 600 maps. In the years to come French and Dutch editions followed in twelve and nine volumes respectively. Purely judging from the number of maps in the Atlas Maior, Blaeu had outdone his rival Johannes Janssonius. And also from a commercial point of view it was a huge success. Also due to the superior typography the Atlas Maior by Blaeu soon became a status symbol for rich citizens. Costing 350 guilders for a non-coloured and 450 guilders for a coloured version, the atlas was the most precious book of the 17th century. However, the Atlas Maior was also a turning point: after that time the role of Dutch cartography (and Netherlandish cartography in general) was finished. Janssonius died in 1664 while a great fire in 1672 destroyed one of Blaeu's print shops. In that fire a part of the copperplates went up in flames. Fairly soon afterwards Joan Blaeu died, in 1673. The almost 2,000 copperplates of Janssonius and Blaeu found their way to other publishers. =French cartography= Dieppe school of cartographers The Dieppe maps are a series of world maps produced in Dieppe, France, in the 1540s, 1550s and 1560s. They are large hand-produced maps, commissioned for wealthy and royal patrons, including Henry II of France and Henry VIII of England. The Dieppe school of cartographers included Pierre Desceliers, Johne Rotz, Guillaume Le Testu, Guillaume Brouscon and Nicolas Desliens. Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and the charting of far southern skies First modern topographic map of France In the 1670s the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini began work on the first modern topographic map in France. It was completed in 1789 or 1793 by his grandson Cassini de Thury. =18th-century developments= Samuel Dunn, 1794, containing star chart, map of the Solar System, map of the Moon and other features along with Earth's both hemispheres. The Vertical Perspective projection was first used by the German map publisher Matthias Seutter in 1740. He placed his observer at ~12,750 km distance. This is the type of projection used today by Google Earth. The changes in the use of military maps was also part of the modern Military revolution, which changed the need for information as the scale of conflict increases as well. This created a need for maps to help with \\"... consistency, regularity and uniformity in military conflict.\\" The final form of the equidistant conic projection was constructed by the French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle in 1745. The Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert invented several hemispheric map projections. In 1772 he created the Lambert conformal conic and Lambert azimuthal equal-area projections. The Albers equal-area conic projection features no distortion along standard parallels. It was invented by Heinrich Albers in 1805. In 1715 Herman Moll published the Beaver Map, one of the most famous early maps of North America, which he copied from a 1698 work by Nicolas de Fer. In 1763–1767 Captain James Cook mapped Newfoundland. In 1777 Colonel Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres created a monumental four volume atlas of North America, Atlantic Neptune. A survey of Boston Harbor from Atlantic Neptune. In the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, explorers mapped trails and army engineers surveyed government lands. Two agencies were established to provide more detailed, large-scale mapping. They were the U.S. Geological Survey and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (now the National Geodetic Survey under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association). =19th-century developments= \\"Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico by John Distrunell, the 1847 map used during the negotiations of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the Mexican–American War. During his travels in Spanish America (1799–1804) Alexander von Humboldt created the most accurate map of New Spain (now Mexico) to date. Published as part of his Essai politique sur le royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne (1811) (Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain), Humboldt's Carte du Mexique (1804) was based on existing maps of Mexico, but with Humboldt's careful attention to latitude and longitude. Landing at the Pacific coast port of Acapulco in 1803, Humboldt did not leave the port area for Mexico City until he produced a map of the port; when leaving he drew a map of the east coast port of Veracruz, as well as a map of the central plateau of Mexico. Given royal authorization from the Spanish crown for his trip, crown officials in Mexico were eager to aid Humboldt's research. He had access to José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez's Mapa del Arzobispado de México (1768), which he deemed \\"very bad\\", as well as the seventeenth-century map of greater Mexico City by savant Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora.Magali M. Carrera, Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices on Nineteenth-century Mexico. Durham: Duke University Press 2011, pp. 74–75. John Disturnell, a businessman and publisher of guidebooks and maps, published Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico, which was used in the negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), following the Mexican–American War, based on the 1822 map by U.S. cartographer Henry Schenck Tanner.Carrera, Traveling from New Spain to Mexico, pp. 104–105. This map has been described as showing U.S. Manifest Destiny; a copy of the map was offered for sale in 2016 for $65,000. Map making at that time was important for both Mexico and the United States.Paula Rebert, La Gran Línea: Mapping the United States-Mexico Boundary, 1849–1857. Austin: University of Texas Press 2001. The Greenwich prime meridian became the international standard reference for cartographers in 1884. =20th- century developments= During the 20th century, maps became more abundant due to improvements in printing and photography that made production cheaper and easier. Airplanes made it possible to photograph large areas at a time. Two- Point Equidistant projection was first drawn up by Hans Maurer in 1919. In this projection the distance from any point on the map to either of the two regulating points is accurate. The loximuthal projection was constructed by Karl Siemon in 1935 and refined by Waldo Tobler in 1966. Since the mid-1990s, the use of computers in map making has helped to store, sort, and arrange data for mapping in order to create map projections. =Contemporary developments=  Software development  Nowadays map-making heavily relies on computer software to develop and provide a variety of services, a trend that already started at the end of the previous century. For instance, self-location, browser search of places, business, products, and area, and distance calculation. At the present time, computer-based software is dominated by big companies that offer their services to a worldwide public, such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps, National Geographic Maps, ESRI Geographic Information System (GIS), CartoDB, Mapbox, Waze, etc. Many other state-based, regional and smaller initiatives, and companies offer their services. The list of online map services is quite long and is growing every day.  Historical map collections  Recent development also include the integration of ancient maps and modern scholar research combined with modern computer software to elaborate periodical history maps. Initiatives such as Euratlas History Maps (which covers the whole of Europe from the year 1 AD to the present), Centennia Historical Atlas (which covers Europe from the year 1000AD to the present), Geacron, and many others who work in what is called historical cartography. These maps include evolution of countries, provinces and cities, wars and battles, the history of border changes, etc. Today historical cartography is thriving. The specialization of map services is ever growing. New map projections are still being developed, university map collections, such as Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection at the University of Texas, offer better and more diverse maps and map tools every day, making available for their students and the broad public ancient maps that in the past were difficult to find. David Rumsey Historical Map Collection is nowadays a worldwide known initiative.  Self-publishing tools and collaborative mapping  Never in the past there were many \\"edit-yourself\\" map tools and software available for non-specialist. Map blogs and self- publishing are common. In 2004, Steve Coast created OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OpenStreetMap has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. History of cartography's technological changes :More at Cartography § Technological changes A portrait of a mapmaker looking up intently from his charts and holding a caliper, 1714. In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment and therefore varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of the compass, printing press, telescope, sextant, quadrant and vernier allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions. Professor Steven Weber of the University of California, Berkeley, has advanced the hypothesis that the concept of the \\"nation state\\" is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies. Advances in photochemical technology, such as the lithographic and photochemical processes, have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps. In the mid-to-late 20th century, advances in electronic technology have led to further revolution in cartography. Specifically computer hardware devices such as computer screens, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters along with visualization, image processing, spatial analysis and database software, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps, particularly with their ability to produce maps that show slightly different features, without engraving a new printing plate. See also digital raster graphic and History of web mapping. Aerial photography and satellite imagery have provided high- accuracy, high-throughput methods for mapping physical features over large areas, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, and topography.

Players control a fighter jet through six level to destroy a terrorist organization, who are destroying major worldwide cities and brainwashing the world's population with propaganda. Its gameplay involves destroying waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and new weapons, and destroying bosses. It was programmed for the Cave 68000 arcade system board. Air Gallet was developed by Gazelle, an off-shoot of defunct developer Toaplan. It was directed by Tatsuya Uemura and designed by Junya Inoue, who wanted it to have a more boisterous presentation compared to his previous works. Gazelle's financial difficulties and strict time schedules forced its development to be hastily rushed. The game was released to mixed reviews; while its graphics and sprite layering techniques were praised, critics felt that it wasn't as polished or innovative as other, similar games were. Inoue has since expressed his disappointment in its quality. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Air Gallet is a vertical-scrolling shooter game, with its gameplay being similar to titles like Raiden (1990). Its plot involves a terrorist organization which, in addition to destroying major cities worldwide, forces news stations to brainwash the world's population with propaganda stories. The players, who are part of a rebelling organization, are sent out to stop them. Players traverse through six automatically-scrolling stages, set in locations such as harbors, forests, and Tokyo Tower. The objective is to make it to the end by destroying waves of enemies and avoiding projectiles. Each level concludes in a boss fight against an enemy aircraft. Players can upgrade their fighter jet by collecting four matching power capsules. Weapons include a laser, a support drone, homing missiles, machine guns, and a spread shot. Each weapon can be upgraded four times; should the player die, their weapon level reverts back to zero. Players can also pick up star-shaped medals that cycle through different point values, and two varieties of smart bombs that either clear the screen of enemies or provide a focused, narrow attack. Development and release Air Gallet was developed by Gazelle, a company established by former Toaplan employees after the latter's bankruptcy in 1994. (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). It was designed by Junya Inoue, who had worked on titles such as Batsugun (1994), and directed by Tatsuya Uemura. It features the voice work of Lenne Hardt and Jeff Manning. Inoue wanted Air Gallet to be different from his previous projects, with a more \\"loud\\" and boisterous presentation. However, Gazelle's severe financial difficulties and strict deadlines prevented him from being able to design it exactly how he wanted. Inoue himself created most of the game's backdrops, such as the Tokyo-themed area in the second level. Development was hastily rushed to meet deadline, giving the team little time to finetune its difficulty balance and mechanics. Air Gallet was published by Banpresto, a subsidiary of Bandai that focused primarily on games with licensed anime characters. Banpresto had worked with Gazelle on an arcade adaptation of Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon a year prior, which gave the two companies a solid business relationship. The game was released in February 1996, being titled Aku Gallet in Japan. It was produced for the Cave 68000 arcade system board. After launch, the title was showcased to attendees at the 1996 AOU Show. After its release, Inoue and other employees left Gazelle to join Cave. Reception A writer for Consoles Plus wrote that Air Gallet had little to offer in terms of innovation. Outside of its impressive graphics and backdrops, they felt its gameplay was nothing new compared to other shooters, but that the game itself was decent. Inoue has expressed his disappointment in the game's quality, going as far as to say it bordered on being kusoge. Retro Gamers Ryan Lambie was quick to point out similarities between Air Gallet and Raiden, specifically its similar fighter craft designs and power-up system. Lambie complemented the game's detailed backdrops, sprite layering techniques, and humorous voice-overs. While Lambie noted its high difficulty level, he showed appreciation for its forgiveness towards newer players. Overall, Lambie described Air Gallet as being \\"an intense, excellently-crafted shooter\\". Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 found the overall look of the game to be lacking compared to Toaplan's offerings, writing that aside from its voice- over clips it \\"looks like another faceless shooter\\". He enjoyed the game's level design for their obtuse-looking themes, and felt some of the backdrops possessed some impressive sprite layering techniques. Zverloff concluded that Air Gallet was an impressive game, but lacked the polish that similar shooters from Toaplan and Cave featured.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TGF-β superfamily. It has close sequence homology to BMP7 and BMP5 and is believed to play a role in bone and cartilage development. It has been shown to be expressed in the hippocampus of murine embryos. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. Many BMPs are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily. BMPs were originally identified by an ability of demineralized bone extract to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site. Based on its expression early in embryogenesis, the BMP encoded by this gene has a proposed role in early development. In addition, the fact that this BMP is closely related to BMP5 and BMP7 has led to speculation of possible bone inductive activity.

Similar to Contra and its \\"Gryzor\\", there was a European release of the game called Typhoon, which is the name used for Imagine Software's ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 ports. The players control a \\"Tom Tiger\\" helicopter (in the 2D stage) and later a \\"Jerry Mouse\\" fighter jet (in the 3D stage), and shoot enemies in the air and bomb them on the ground, collecting power-ups and defeating bosses to advance levels. Gameplay The game takes place in a fictional 2007 where the Earth has been conquered by alien invaders. The player combats the occupation forces using vehicles under operation code named 'A Jax' created to liberate the Earth. Game play is divided into two scrolling sections with two different vehicles: the first being a vertical scrolling section with the helicopter and a Rail scrolling stage with the jet/space fighter. The game spans eight stages and extends are set to 30,000 and a second at 150,000 points. During the helicopter segments, the player has access to four different weapons including the Vulcan, Bomb, 3-Way, Triple and Laser. Each weapon is available through their own specific pick-up icon. However, the helicopter can only equip one firing weapon at a time with the Bomb being constant. The player also has access to Options which add additional firepower. The jet segments contrast highly from the helicopter segments in the complete lack of available power- ups and additional weapons beyond a machine gun and bomb.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed A Jax on their January 15, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

Their present-day population is about 14,000 (INE 2002), with some 500 living on the left bank of the Orinoco River, in Colombia, in several reservations between the Vichada (north) and the Guaviare (south).Freire & Zent. 2007. \\"Los Piaroa\\", in Salud Indígena en Venezuela, vol. 1.

Society Seeing competition as spiritually evil and lauding cooperation, the Piaroa are both strongly egalitarian and supportive of individual autonomy.Graeber, David. 2004 \\"Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology.\\" The Piaroa are also strongly anti-authoritarian and opposed to the hoarding of resources, which they see as giving members the power to constrain their freedom. Despite sometimes being described as one of the world's most peaceful societies, modern anthropologists report that the relations of Piaroa with neighbouring tribes are actually \\"unfriendly, marked by physical or magical warfare\\".https://ivic.academia.edu/Zent/Papers/454553/The_Political_Ecology_of_Ethnic_Frontiers_and_Relations_among_the_Piaroa_of_the_Middle_Orinoco Violent conflict erupted between the Piaroa and the wæñæpi of the Upper Suapure and Guaviarito regions, with both tribes fighting to control the clay pits of the Guanay valley. Clay from that valley is a valuable commodity, being the best clay for making pottery in the region. Constant warfare also exists between the Piaroa and Caribs, who invaded Piaroa territory from the east in search of captives. Anthropologist Joanna Overing also notes that social hierarchy is minimal, and that it would be difficult to say any form of male dominance exists, despite leaders being traditionally male. As a result, the Piaroa have been described by some anthropologists as a functioning anarchist society.  Religion  Traditional Piaora religion involves shamans and is centered around a creator god named Wahari who was said to have incarnated as a tapir. However, many Piaora have converted to Christianity and the influence of the shamans over local communities have waned as new generations of Piaora are becoming more educated and modernized.  Economy  The Piaroa engage in many forms of subsistence. Many are agriculturists and grow cassava, cash crops, and more. Some also hunt, fish, raise cattle, and collect vines (for rattan furniture). Wage work is also a common occupation among the Piaora. Language The Piaroa speak Wötʰïhä tivene, or Piaroa language, which belongs to the Salivan language family.Overing, J. 1988. \\"Los Wothuha,\\" in Aborígenes de Venezuela, edited by J Lizot.

Eucharitid wasps are members of the superfamily Chalcidoidea and consist of three subfamilies: Oraseminae, Eucharitinae, and Gollumiellinae. Most of the 55 genera and 417 species of Eucharitidae are members of the subfamilies Oraseminae and Eucharitinae,Heraty, John. Eucharitidae. Hymenopteran Systematics, University of California, Riverside (2002): Web. 16 Sep. 2011. and are found in tropical regions of the world. Eucharitids are specialized parasitoids of ants, meaning each species is usually only parasitic of one genus of ant. Furthermore, they are one of the few parasitoids that have been able to use ants as hosts, despite ants’ effective defense systems against most parasitoids.Lachaud, Jean-Paul and Perez-Lachaud, Gavriela. Impact of natural parasitism by two eucharitid wasps on a potential biocontrol agent ant in southeastern Mexico. Biological Control 48 (2009): 92-99.Heraty, J.M. Biology and importance of two eucharitid parasites of Wasmannia and Solenopsis. (1994): Pages 104-120 in Williams, D. (ed), Exotic Ants: Biology, Impact and Control of Introduced Species. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. 332 pp. Eucharitid parasitism occurs year-round, with a majority of it occurring during hot and humid months. However, the amount of parasitism that occurs depends primarily on the size of the ant colony and the number of host pupae in them, and not on the season. Life cycle Female eucharitids oviposit rows of eggs into plant tissue, such as leaves and stems, away from ant colonies.Varone, L. and Briano, J. Bionomics of Orasema simplex (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae), a parasitoid of Solenopsis fire ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Argentina. Biological Control 48 (2009): 204-209. The eggs are a translucent white and are about 0.19 mm long and 0.08 mm wide. They are elliptical and flat on one side. As the eggs mature, they turn a brown color and ten days after oviposition, they hatch. The larvae are solely responsible for their entry into the ant colony and the parasitism of their host. They are 0.13 mm long and are able to travel several inches on the leaf but do not leave the egg cluster. After six to seven days, they attach themselves to foraging ants heading back to their brood; however, sometimes they will attach themselves to other insects, using them as intermediate hosts. Once in the brood, the larvae will attach to their host larva. Some Eucharitidae are external parasites while others are internal parasites; however, all eucharitid species finish their development as ectoparasites. Limited feeding on the host occurs until the host pupates, after which, most of it is consumed by the wasp. Usually, only one parasite per host is found, but in some cases, superparasitism occurs, and two to four wasps will attach to, and emerge from one host. Once the wasps emerge, the ant colony grooms and feeds them as if they were part of the ants’ brood. In some instances, worker ants have been observed assisting the wasps to emerge from their host. The wasps gain acceptance in these ways, and the ants show no signs of aggression because the wasps acquire their host's odor upon entry into the colony. By mimicking the odor of their host, eucharitid wasps are able to keep themselves safe until the scent wears off, at which point they leave the ant colony and begin mating. Adult wasps emerge from the ant nest in the morning; the males emerge before the females. In most cases, the males swarm one to two feet above the nest, and as soon as the females emerge, mating occurs. However, the males of certain species, such as Kapala terminalis, calmly wait on foliage surrounding the nest until the females emerge. Many times, the males will begin mating with the females before they have a chance to take flight, and in some instances, mating will occur while the wasps are still inside the ants' nest.Clausen, C.P. The habits of the Eucharidae. Psyche 48 (1941): 57-69. After mating, the females lay all their eggs in one day. The egg capacity of each female is 1000 to 10000. Anatomy Most eucharitids are between 2.0 and 5.4 mm long and vary from metallic colors to black. They have 13 or fewer segments on their antennae, but some have up to 26.Heraty, J.M. Family Eucharitidae. (1995) Pages 309-314. in Gauld, I.D.; Hanson, P., Hymenoptera of Costa Rica. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ?? The main anatomical characteristics of eucharitid wasps are: *The prepectus lies in the same plane as, and fused, to pronotum. *The pronotum is small and hidden by the head dorsally. *The gaster is usually relatively small with a very long petiole. *The forewing marginal vein is moderately long and stigmal, and the postmarginal veins are extremely short. *Moderately large, about 2.0 to 5.4 mm in length.Pitkin, B. R. Dr. “Eucharitidae”. Natural History Museum (2004) Universal Chalcidoidea Database Notes on families. Web. 30 Sep. 2011. Subfamilies The number of subfamilies of Eucharitidae has changed over the years, but the three most widely accepted are Oraseminae, Eucharitinae, and Gollumiellinae. =Oraseminae= Orasema simplex from Argentina Oraseminae are parasitic on the ant genus Pheidole (Myrmicinae), as well as the fire ant in southern South America and the little red fire ant in the Caribbean. They are distributed worldwide in tropical regions, such as Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina. They are also native to Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Delaware,Ashmead, W.H. Studies on North American Chalcididae, with descriptions of new species from Florida. Transactions of the American Entomological Society 12 (1885[30]): 10-14. and Colorado. The Oraseminae female punctures the plant tissue on which she will oviposit, and places an egg inside of each incision. The eggs are deposited on the edges of the underside of leaves, and are sometimes found in the buds and stems of the plant. They have been known to oviposite on blueberry leaves, tea leaves (Das), oak leaves, olive leaves, mango leaves, flower heads, and banana fingers. Species of Eucharitidae are consistent in their choice of leaf for oviposition. Because Oraseminae eggs are laid on plants that are not always visited by foraging ants, the larvae will most often attach to intermediate hosts,Das, G.M. Preliminary studies on the biology of Orasema assectator Kerrich (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae) parasitic on Pheidole and causing damage to leaves of tea in Assam. Bulletin of Entomological Research 54 (1963): 393-398. or “insect prey” that will eventually be devoured by ants. Sometimes, however, foraging ants are present and there is no need for an intermediate host. Upon arriving at the ants’ brood, the larva burrows into the host's thorax and feeds there. The wasp feeds until the host larva pupates; after the host pupates, the wasp will resume feeding until it emerges from its host. The average time of development from planidia to adult is 29.5 days; the average pupal stage is 8.2 days. Because Oraseminae larvae, pupae, and adults are easily distinguished from their host,Vander Meer, R.K., Jouvenaz, D.P. and Wojcik, D.P. Chemical mimicry in a parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae) of fire ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Journal of Chemical Ecology 15 (1989): 2247-2261. the wasps disguise themselves by passively obtaining the odor of the fire ants. After a few days in the nest, the odor wears off and the ants begin to notice the wasps are not a part of their brood. At this point, the wasps leave the nest to mate and lay eggs. Though Oraseminae have a high fertility rate, only a small percentage of eggs survive to adulthood. =Eucharitinae= Eucharitinae are parasites of poneromorph ants, Ectatommatinae, Ponerinae, and Formicinae, although one genus from Australia is parasitic on the bulldog ant. Female Eucharitinae bear up to 4500 eggs and begin oviposition soon after emerging from the nest. They deposit their eggs in groups of eight to 15 on plant buds, on the undersides of leaves or on fruit skin. Eucharitinae attach themselves to foraging ants and do not use an intermediate host. Some species of Eucharitinae, such as Kapala terminalis and other Kapala sp., have been known for their jumping capabilities. They stand erect on the plant on which they hatched, and without any distinguishable preparation, jump about 10 mm from the leaf onto a foraging ant. The larvae are external parasites of their hosts, and are not noticed due to their acquisition of the host’s odor. After the wasps are fully developed, they emerge in large numbers. The males swarm around the nest in wait of the females. Mating takes place immediately, and oviposition occurs soon after. A fossil genus, Palaeocharis is known from Eocene Baltic amber. =Gollumiellinae= Gollumiellinae are unique in that they hook their eggs onto the plants and connect a ropey secretion to them, which stand erect. This acts as an attraction mechanism for Paratrechina ants. Gollumiellinae larvae burrow into the hosts' thoraces and feed there. The rest of its life cycle is similar to the aforementioned life cycle of eucharitids. Biological control Eucharitids are candidates for biological control because each subfamily targets a specific ant genus. On the other hand, some eucharitids, including the genus Kapala, are classified as pests for several different reasons. First, a few days after oviposition occurs, the leaves dry up where each egg was located. Second, tea leaves with such marks reportedly do not have as strong of a flavor as tea leaves without these marks. Third, not all eucharitids have a significant effect on the size of their hosts' colony. Orasema species are sometimes used as means of biological control for many ants, including the fire ant and little fire ant, because pesticides can cause damage to the environment, and they do not always work on fire ants. In addition, at least two eucharitid species groups are specialized parasites of these ants. Heraty stated, “Leaving aside the philosophical problems associated with introducing any organism for biological control, I believe that species of Orasema do have potential as biological control agents and deserve more study.” References =Additional references= *UC Riverside Eucharitid Page *Primary descriptions pdfs External links * Universal Chalcidoid Database *Cedar Creek images of pinned specimens *Catalog of World Eucharitidae.

He was the eldest son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles. Although the latter may have intended for his younger son, Óláfr, to succeed to the kingship, the Islesmen chose Rǫgnvaldr, who was likely Óláfr's half-brother. Rǫgnvaldr went on to rule the Kingdom of the Isles for almost forty years before losing control to Óláfr. The Crovan dynasty may have reached its zenith during Rǫgnvaldr's reign.McDonald (2016) p. 336. Acclaimed in one near contemporary Scandinavian source as \\"the greatest warrior in the western lands\\",McDonald (2016) p. 336; Wadden (2014) p. 36; Crawford, BE (2013); McDonald (2007a) pp. 45, 56; McDonald (2007b) pp. 17, 29, 41, 101, 108, 120; Williams, G (2007) p. 147; MacQuarrie (2006); Sellar (1997–1998); Duffy (1993) p. 63; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 25 n. 74. he lent military aid to William I, King of Scotland against the disaffected Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness, and occupied Caithness for a short period of time at about the turn of the thirteenth century. Like his predecessors, Rǫgnvaldr was closely associated with the rulers of northern Wales. A daughter of his was betrothed to Rhodri ab Owain, a dynast of the ruling family of Gwynedd. In 1193, Rǫgnvaldr lent military aid to Rhodri against his rivals. Rǫgnvaldr was also involved in Irish affairs, as he was the brother-in-law of John de Courcy, one of the most powerful of the incoming Englishmen. With Courcy's eventual fall from power in the first decade of the thirteenth century, Rǫgnvaldr aided him in an unsuccessful attack on Courcy's rivals. On numerous occasions from 1205 to 1219, Rǫgnvaldr bound himself to the English Crown by rendering homage to John, King of England and his successor, Henry III, King of England. In return for his vassalage, these English rulers promised to assist Rǫgnvaldr against any threats to his realm, whilst Rǫgnvaldr pledged to protect English interests in the Irish Sea zone. With the strengthening of Norwegian kingship in the first half of the century, the Norwegian Crown began to look towards the Isles, and in 1210 the region fell prey to a destructive military expedition. In consequence, Rǫgnvaldr rendered homage to Ingi Bárðarson, King of Norway. The resurgence of Norwegian authority threat may well have been the reason why Rǫgnvaldr submitted to Pope Honorius III in 1219, and promised to pay a perpetual tribute for the protection of his realm. Óláfr's allotment in Rǫgnvaldr's island-kingdom appears to have been Lewis and Harris. When confronted by Óláfr for more territory, Rǫgnvaldr had him seized and incarcerated by the Scots. After almost seven years in captivity, Óláfr was released in 1214, and Rǫgnvaldr arranged for him to marry the sister of his own wife. Óláfr was able to have this marriage annulled, sometime after 1217, whereupon he married the daughter of a rising Scottish magnate. Outright warfare broke out between the half-brothers in the 1220s, and Óláfr's gains forced Rǫgnvaldr to turn to the powerful Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway. Rǫgnvaldr and Alan bound themselves through the marriage of a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr to Alan's illegitimate son, Thomas. The prospect of a future Gallovidian king prompted the Manxmen to depose Rǫgnvaldr in favour of Óláfr. Although Rǫgnvaldr was initially aided against Óláfr by Alan and his family, Gallovidian military support dramatically diminished over time. On 14 February 1229, the forces of Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr clashed for the last time, and Rǫgnvaldr himself was slain. His body was conveyed to St Mary's Abbey, Furness and buried. Sources Rǫgnvaldr's name as it appears on folio 40v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII (the Chronicle of Mann): \\"'\\".Munch; Goss (1874a) p. 78; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). The main source for Rǫgnvaldr and his reign is the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, a historical account of the rulers of the Hebrides and Mann—the Crovan dynasty in particular—which survives in a Latin manuscript dating to the mid fourteenth century.McDonald (2012) pp. 151–152; McDonald (2007b) pp. 37–38. Although the chronicle is the region's only contemporary indigenous narrative source, it is certainly not without its faults. Not only is its chronology suspect in parts, but it appears to be biased in favour of one branch of the dynasty over another—specifically the line of Rǫgnvaldr's rival half-brother over that of his own.Oram; Adderley (2010) p. 128; Woolf (2008); McDonald (2007b) pp. 37–38; Davey, PJ (2006b). Other important sources are royal acta of the dynasty. Of the twenty or so examples of such sources, six (all copies) were issued during Rǫgnvaldr's career.McDonald (2007b) p. 38. Numerous sources from outwith the dynasty's domain—such as mediaeval chronicles and annals composed in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Continent—also pertain to his life and times. Several Scandinavian sagas also provide useful information, although the historicity of such sources is debatable in certain circumstances. Also important is surviving correspondence between the dynasty and the English royal court, and the Vatican as well. In addition, certain Welsh genealogies,McDonald (2007b) p. 39. and a contemporary Irish praise-poem composed in Rǫgnvaldr's honour, also cast light upon Rǫgnvaldr's life and times.McDonald (2007b) pp. 39, 117.

In the mid twelfth century, Guðrøðr Óláfsson inherited the kingship of the Isles,Duffy (2004b). a region comprising the Hebrides and Mann.Sellar (2004). He soon faced internal opposition from his brother-in-law, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll,Duffy (2004b); Sellar (2004). who seized the Inner Hebridean portion of the kingdom in 1153. Three years later, Somairle seized the entire kingdom, and ruled the entirety of the Isles until his death in 1164. Although Guðrøðr Óláfsson regained the kingship, the territories lost to his brother-in-law in 1153 were retained by the latter's descendants, the Meic Somairle (or Clann Somairle). Guðrøðr Óláfsson had one daughter and at least three sons: Affrica, Ívarr, Óláfr, and Rǫgnvaldr himself.McDonald (2007b) pp. 27 tab. 1, 70.

When Guðrøðr Óláfsson died in 1187, the Chronicle of Mann claims that he left instructions for Óláfr to succeed to the kingship since the latter had been born \\"in lawful wedlock\\".McDonald (2019) pp. 24, 66, 77; Beuermann (2014) p. 87; Oram (2011) pp. 156, 169; Flanagan (2010) p. 195 n. 123; McDonald (2007b) pp. 70–71, 94, 170; Duffy (2004c); Broderick (2003); Oram (2000) p. 105; Anderson (1922) pp. 313–314; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 78–79. Whether this is an accurate record of events is uncertain,Oram (2011) p. 156; McDonald (2007b) p. 94. as the Islesmen are stated to have chosen Rǫgnvaldr to rule instead, because unlike Óláfr, who was only a child at the time, Rǫgnvaldr was a hardy young man fully capable to reign as king.McDonald (2019) pp. 24, 46, 48, 66, 77; Oram (2011) pp. 156, 169; Flanagan (2010) p. 195 n. 123; McDonald (2007b) pp. 70–71; Duffy (2004c); Oram (2000) pp. 105, 124; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 260; Anderson (1922) pp. 313–314; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 78–79. Although the chronicle seems to imply that Findguala was also Rǫgnvaldr's mother, at no point does the source state as much. In fact, there is evidence which strongly suggests that Rǫgnvaldr was the son of another woman.McDonald (2007b) pp. 72–73. For example, the surviving fragments of a letter sent from Óláfr to Henry III, King of England in about 1228 reveal that Óláfr described Rǫgnvaldr as a bastard son of his father.McDonald (2007b) pp. 72–73; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) p. 136 § 9; Document 1/16/1 (n.d.). Furthermore, the contemporary Gaelic praise-poem, Baile suthach síth Emhna, declares that he was a son of Sadb,McDonald (2019) p. 78; Wadden (2014) p. 33; McDonald (2008) p. 134; McDonald (2007b) pp. 72–73; Duffy (2004c); Clancy; Márkus (1998) pp. 237, 239; Skene (1890) pp. 410–427; Bardic Poetry Database (n.d.) § 279.

The likelihood that Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr had different mothers may well explain the intense conflict between the two men in the years that followed.McDonald (2019) pp. 78–79; McDonald (2007b) p. 73. This continuing kin-strife is one of the main themes of Rǫgnvaldr's long reign.McDonald (2012) p. 167. Strained relations with Óláfr king gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 156 fig. 1a, 188 fig. 15. Comprising some four sets,Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 197–198. the pieces are thought to have been crafted in Norway in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 165, 197–198. They were uncovered in Lewis in the early nineteenth century.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 155; McDonald (2007a) p. 48. According to the Chronicle of Mann, Rǫgnvaldr gave Óláfr possession of a certain island called \\"Lodhus\\". The chronicle disparagingly describes the island as being mountainous and rocky, completely unsuitable for cultivation, and declares that its small population lived mostly by hunting and fishing. In fact, Lewis is the northern part of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis and Harris. Whilst the southern part—Harris—is somewhat mountainous, the northern part—Lewis—is rather flat and boggy. The chronicle, therefore, seems to have conflated the northern and southern parts of the island.McDonald (2007b) p. 44 n. 8; McDonald (1997) p. 151 n. 86. In any case, the chronicle claims that, because of the impoverishment of his lands, Óláfr was unable to support himself and his followers, and that in consequence he led \\"a sorry life\\".McDonald (2012) p. 167; Oram; Adderley (2010) p. 128; McDonald (2007b) pp. 44, 77; Power (2005) p. 40; Oram (2000) p. 125; McDonald (1997) pp. 85, 151; Anderson (1922) pp. 456–457; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 82–85. The chronicle's otherwise perceptible prejudice against Rǫgnvaldr's branch of the Crovan dynasty, and its apparent bias in favour of Mann over the northernmost reaches of the realm, may also account for its denigrating depiction of Óláfr's allotted lands.Oram; Adderley (2010) p. 128. In consequence of this supposed poverty, the chronicle claims that Óláfr went to Rǫgnvaldr, who was also living in the Hebrides, and confronted him for more land. Rǫgnvaldr's stated response was to have Óláfr seized and sent to William I, King of Scotland, who kept him imprisoned for almost seven years.McDonald (2019) p. 66; McDonald (2012) p. 167; Oram (2013); McDonald (2008) p. 145, 145 n. 74; McDonald (2007b) p. 78; Pollock (2005) p. 18 n. 93; Oram (2000) p. 125; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Anderson (1922) p. 457; Munch; (Goss 1874a) pp. 84–85. It may be more probable, however, that Rǫgnvaldr had taken action against Óláfr because the latter had approached the Norwegian Crown, and offered himself as a more palatable vassal-king in return for Norwegian support in deposing Rǫgnvaldr.Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 169. In any case, the chronicle states that William died during the seventh year of Óláfr's captivity, and that William had ordered the release of all his political prisoners before his passing. Since William died in December 1214,McDonald (2007b) p. 78; Scott (2004). Óláfr's incarceration appears to have spanned between about 1207 and 1214 or early 1215.McDonald (2019) p. 66; McDonald (2012) p. 176 n. 73; McDonald 2007 p. 78. Upon Óláfr's release, the chronicle reveals that the half-brothers met on Mann, after which Óláfr set off on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Excerpt from page 26 of Dublin Royal Irish Academy 23 E 29 (Baile suthach síth Emhna). This stanza about Rǫgnvaldr translates: \\"Thou hast inflicted a rout on ' in defeat, and the fresh blows were as battle demons from thee; many the men in a glen prostrate in defeat from a bright slender blue-eyed noble battle-spirit\\".McDonald (2007b) p. 120; Clancy; Márkus (1998) p. 241; Ó Cuív (1956–1957) p. 296; Skene (1890) pp. 424–425; Bardic Poetry Database (n.d.) § 279. Baile suthach sith Eamhna (or \\"suthain�?) $; Royal Irish Academy MS 23 E 29 (n.d.). At roughly this period, in 1209, the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reports that the sons of Ragnall mac Somairle attacked Skye and slaughtered many of the Skyemen.Oram (2011) p. 168; McDonald (2007a) p. 57; Annala Uladh (2005) § 1209.2; Brown, M (2004) p. 71; Annala Uladh (2003) § 1209.2; Sellar (2000) p. 195; Anderson (1922) p. 378. It is unknown if this invasion of Rǫgnvaldr's realm was any way related to the slaying of Ragnall's brother, Áengus mac Somairle, and the latter's three sons, in the following year. What is certain, however, is that these, and other records concerning the Meic Somairle, reveal that the Crovan dynasty was not alone in introducing instability into the Isles.Oram (2011) pp. 168–169. In fact, the elimination of Áengus and his sons appears to have had serious repercussions on not only the Meic Somairle succession, but Rǫgnvaldr's kingship in the Isles.Oram (2013); Woolf (2007) p. 80. Relations with William of Scotland Seal of William I, King of Scotland. There is earlier evidence of amicable relations between Rǫgnvaldr and William.McDonald (2007b) pp. 78, 114. The latter faced a series of revolts during his reign,Scott (2004). with one particular problem being Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness.Crawford, BE (2013); Crawford, BE (2004a). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr Maddaðarson put aside his first wife, and married Hvarflǫð, described by the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga as the daughter of an Earl of Moray named Máel Coluim.Crawford, BE (2013); Oram (2011) p. 141; Crawford, BE (2004a); Topping (1983) pp. 112–113, 112 n. 3; Vigfusson (1887a) p. 221; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 192. It may well have been through Hvarflǫð that Haraldr Maddaðarson was drawn into conflict with the Scottish Crown.Oram (2011) pp. 158–159; Crawford, BE (2004a); Topping (1983) p. 113. Whatever the case, a major continuing theme of Haraldr Maddaðarson's career was the constant assertion of Scottish and Norwegian royal authority into is domain, and his remarkable resistance to such interference.Crawford, BE (2013); Topping (1983). The name of Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness as it appears on folio 56v of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 198 ch. 14; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). Like Rǫgnvaldr, Haraldr Maddaðarson operated in a mixed Norse-Gaelic milieu, contending with Scottish and Norwegian kings alike. In 1196, Haraldr Maddaðarson appears to have gained control of Moray. Although William was able to reassert authority in the north, and hand Caithness over to Haraldr Eiríksson, a more amiable applicant, Haraldr Maddaðarson managed to overcome the latter, and regained control of the earldom.Crawford, BE (2004a); Topping (1983) pp. 117–118; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 76–77. It may have been at this point where Rǫgnvaldr entered the fray. According to Orkneyinga saga, once William learned that Haraldr Maddaðarson had taken control of Caithness, Rǫgnvaldr was tasked to intervene on behalf of the Scottish Crown. Having received the king's message, the saga records that Rǫgnvaldr gathered an armed host from the Isles, Kintyre, and Ireland, and went forth into Caithness, where he subdued the region. With the coming of winter, the saga records that Rǫgnvaldr returned to the Isles after having left three stewards in Caithness. When Haraldr Maddaðarson later had one of these stewards murdered, the saga states that William forced him into submission.Crawford, BE (2013); McDonald (2012) p. 157; Somerville; McDonald (2014) pp. 473–475 §§ 110–112; McDonald (2007a) pp. 55–56, 72; McDonald (2007b) p. 108; Williams, G (2007) pp. 146–147; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 292–293; Crawford, BE (2004a); Crawford, BE (2004b) p. 31; Rekdal (2003–2004) p. 264; Sellar (2000) pp. 196–197; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 135, 150; Duffy (1993) p. 63; Topping (1983) p. 118; Cowan (1982) p. 41; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 77–78; Anderson (1922) p. 350 n. 2; Vigfusson (1887a) pp. 225–228; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 195–199 §§ 114–116. The fact that Haraldr Maddaðarson only reasserted his authority action after Rǫgnvaldr's return to the Isles, coupled with the punishing fine that the former imposed upon the Caithnessmen once regaining control, suggests that Rǫgnvaldr had enjoyed support in the region.Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 80; Vigfusson (1887a) p. 226; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 197. Ruinous Castle of Old Wick, a seemingly twelfth- or thirteenth-century fortress, was possibly the power centre of Haraldr Maddaðarson.Crawford, BE (2013); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 288 fig. 55. Rǫgnvaldr's involvement in Caithness is also noted by the contemporary English chronicler Roger de Hoveden. According to Roger's Chronica, after two rounds of negotiations between Haraldr Maddaðarson and William failed, Rǫgnvaldr intervened and bought Caithness from William.Crawford, BE (2013); McDonald (2007a) p. 56; McDonald (2007b) pp. 109–113; Williams, G (2007) p. 147; Murray (2005) p. 286, 286 n. 7; Crawford 2004a; Sellar (2000) p. 197; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150; Barrow (1992) p. 83 n. 65; Barrow; Scott (1971) pp. 16 n. 65, 25 n. 74; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 77–78, 77 n. 3; Anderson (1908) p. 318; Stubbs (1871) p. 12; Oliver (1860) p. 42; Riley (1853) p. 393. The precise date of Rǫgnvaldr's venture is uncertain, although it appears to have occurred in about 1200.McDonald (2007a) p. 56; McDonald (2007b) p. 110. Just prior to Rǫgnvaldr's involvement, Roger records that Haraldr Maddaðarson ventured into the Isles where he reinforced himself with an armed fleet, before returning to Orkney and Caithnes, and defeating Haraldr Eiríksson at Wick.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 66–67; McDonald (2012) p. 157; McDonald (2007a) pp. 70–71, 111; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 292; Topping (1983) p. 118; Anderson (1908) p. 317; Stubbs (1871) p. 11; Oliver (1860) pp. 40–41; Riley (1853) p. 393. If this part of Roger's account refers to military aid being received from Rǫgnvaldr's realm, the fact that Rǫgnvaldr and Haraldr Maddaðarson later became opponents would appear to reveal the fragility of certain of alliances.McDonald (2007b) p. 111. On the other hand, if Roger's account refers to the domain of the Meic Somairle, it could be evidence that Haraldr Maddaðarson was able to garner support from Rǫgnvaldr's rivals.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 292. According to tradition, the stone circle Clach an Righ (\\"King's Stone\\"), near Syre, marks the site where Haraldr Maddaðarson was defeated by Rǫgnvaldr.Lelong (2002) pp. 236, 340; Gunn; Mackay (1897) p. 152; Mackay (1896) p. 519; Mackay (1890–1891) pp. 110–112; Joas (1862–1864). Although not descended from previous Orcadian earls, Rǫgnvaldr could perhaps be considered related to these Norwegian magnates by right of his paternal grandfather's marriage to Ingibjǫrg, daughter of Hákon Pálsson, Earl of Orkney. If this was indeed the case, William's act of using Rǫgnvaldr in Caithness may have been an example of the king playing one member of the ' against another.McDonald (2012) pp. 158–159; McDonald (2007b) p. 111; Williams, G (2007) p. 147; Crawford, BE (2004b) p. 31; Cowan (1982) p. 41; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 78–79. The ' were people who possessed a claim to an earldom, in accordance with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls.McDonald (2012) pp. 158–159; Crawford, BE (2004b) p. 41 n. 61. In fact, William made use of the ' when he had earlier granted Caithness to Haraldr Eiríksson, a grandson of Rǫgnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney.Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 78–79. On the other hand, the fact that Rǫgnvaldr possessed no known blood relationship with the earls could conversely be evidence that he was the first Scottish-backed ruler of Caithness without a personal connection to the Orcadian '.Beuermann (2009); Beuermann (2008). In any event, although it is not impossible that Rǫgnvaldr ruled as Earl of Caithness for a short time,McDonald (2007b) p. 111 n. 42; Oram (2000) p. 108. surviving evidence does not record his installation as such, and only demonstrates that he was appointed to administrate the province.McDonald (2007b) p. 111, 111 n. 42. The Isle of Man Airport encompasses a site once called Ronaldsway. Rǫgnvaldr may well be the eponym of this place name.McDonald (2007b) p. 40. Rǫgnvaldr's participation in league with the Scottish Crown could have stemmed from his kinship with the Constable of Scotland, Roland fitz Uhtred, Lord of Galloway,Murray (2005) pp. 286–287, 286 n. 7; Oram (2000) pp. 105, 108. or perhaps resulted from a shared enmity towards the Meic Somairle.McDonald (2007b) p. 112. There is much confusion surrounding two twelfth-century magnates named Máel Coluim. One was Máel Coluim mac Áeda, Earl of Ross, whilst the other was Máel Coluim mac Alasdair, an illegitimate son of Alexander I, King of Scotland. The latter Máel Coluim attempted to seize the Scottish throne earlier in the twelfth century, and appears to have been related in marriage to Somairle's family.Ross, AD (2003) pp. 174–186. If Hvarflǫð's father was this Máel Coluim, it could explain an alliance between Haraldr Maddaðarson and the Meic Somairle.McDonald (2007b) pp. 111–112; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 289–292. Such an alliance with Rǫgnvaldr's rivals could also explain the Scottish Crown's use of him against Haraldr Maddaðarson.McDonald (2007b) pp. 111–112. Welsh connections The Kingdom of Gwynedd, and the extent of English dominance in Ireland and Wales, c.1200. From its earliest years, the Crovan dynasty forged alliances with the northern Welsh rulers of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.McDonald (2007a) p. 54; McDonald (2007b) pp. 101–107; Carr (1982) pp. 41–42. Some of the earliest evidence of Rǫgnvaldr's kingship concerns his involvement in northern Wales.McDonald (2007b) pp. 101–102. During the late twelfth century, the region was wracked by vicious interdynastic warring.McDonald (2007b) p. 102; Carr (2004a); Pryce (2004); Davies (2000) pp. 238–239; Carr (1982) pp. 44–46. In 1190, one of Gruffudd's grandsons, Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd, was ejected from Anglesey apparently by the sons of his own brother, Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd.McDonald (2007b) p. 102; Carr (2004a); Carr (1982) p. 45. The thirteenth- and fourteenth-century texts Brenhinedd y SaessonCarr (1982) pp. 45–46, 46 n. 25; Lloyd (1912) pp. 588, 588 n. 70, 617 n. 29; Jones; Williams; Pughe (1870) p. 683. and Brut y Tywysogyon reveal that Rǫgnvaldr militarily supported Rhodri in his successful re-acquisition of Anglesey three years later.McDonald (2007a) pp. 54–55; McDonald (2007b) pp. 102–103; Davies (2000) p. 10 n. 5; Carr (1982) pp. 45–46, 46 n. 25; Lloyd (1912) p. 588, 588 n. 70; Rhŷs; Evans (1890) p. 337; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 238–239. Another mediaeval Welsh text, the fourteenth-century O Oes Gwrtheyrn Gwrtheneu, refers to the year 1193 as ' (\\"the summer of the Gaels\\"), which could further evince the participation of Rǫgnvaldr and his troops.McDonald (2007a) pp. 55, 72; McDonald (2007b) pp. 102–103; Carr (2004a); Moore, D (1996) p. 28, 28 n. 205; Jennings (1994) p. 103; Duffy (1993) pp. 63, 232; Longley (1991) p. 79; Carr (1982) p. 46; Rhŷs; Evans (1890) p. 405. Excerpt from folio 254r of Oxford Jesus College 111: \\"'\\". This so-called \\"summer of the Gaels\\" seems to refer the presence of Rǫgnvaldr's troops in Wales. Rǫgnvaldr and Rhodri were also bound together by a marital alliance,McDonald (2019) p. 80 n. 17; McDonald (2007b) pp. 103–104; Carr (2004a); Carr (2004b); Duffy (1993) p. 63. as a papal letter, dated November 1199, indicates that a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr was betrothed to Rhodri.McDonald (2007a) p. 55; McDonald (2007b) p. 103; Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85; Lloyd (1912) p. 617, 617 n. 29; Bliss (1893) p. 8; Migne (1890) pp. 791–792 § 233. Although the precise date of the marriage is unknown, Rǫgnvaldr's military support of Rhodri in 1193 was almost certainly related to it.McDonald (2007a) p. 55; McDonald (2007b) p. 103. Rhodri died in 1195,McDonald (2007b) p. 103; Carr (2004a); Turvey (2002) p. 86; Davies (2000) p. 240. and the same papal letter indicates that his widow was arranged to marry his nephew, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of Gwynedd. The arrangement appears to have taken place in the context of Llywelyn's consolidation in Gwynedd. Like his uncle, Llywelyn appears to have intended to establish an alliance with the Islesmen in order strengthen his position in Wales.McDonald (2007b) p. 103; Pryce (2005) p. 25; Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85. Although the arrangement may well evidence Rǫgnvaldr's power and influence in the region,McDonald (2007b) p. 103. Llywelyn clearly extricated himself from the arrangement in order to bind himself in marriage to a much stronger and more influential superpower, the English Crown.McDonald (2007b) pp. 103–104; Wilkinson (2005) p. 83; Carr (2004b); Turvey (2002) pp. 86–87; Davies (2000) pp. 10–11; Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85. Although certain correspondence with the papacy reveals that the marriage between Llywelyn and Rǫgnvaldr's daughter had received papal approval in April 1203,McDonald (2007b) p. 103; Pryce (2005) p. 26; Wilkinson (2005) p. 83 n. 11; Carr (2004b); Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85; Davies (2000) p. 194; Richter (1971) p. 207 n. 14; Lloyd (1912) p. 617 n. 29; Bliss (1893) p. 13; Migne (1891) pp. 49–50 § 47. another letter shows that the ratification was reversed on a technicality in February 1205.McDonald (2007b) p. 103; Pryce (2005) p. 26; Wilkinson (2005) p. 83 n. 11; Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85; Lloyd (1912) p. 617 n. 29; Bliss (1893) p. 19; Migne (1891) pp. 534–537 § 220. This ruling was clearly one of convenience for Llywelyn,McDonald (2007b) pp. 103–104; Wilkinson (2005) p. 83, 83 n. 11; Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85. as the latter was by this time married to Joan, an illegitimate daughter of John, King of England.Gillingham (2010); McDonald (2007b) pp. 103–104; Wilkinson (2005) p. 83, 83 n. 11; Carr (2004b); Pryce (1993) pp. 84–85; Lloyd (1912) p. 616. This may have been about the time when Rǫgnvaldr himself first entered into what would be an enduring relationship with the English Crown.McDonald (2007b) p. 104.

There may be further evidence of Rǫgnvaldr's Welsh connections. According to several non- contemporary Welsh genealogical tracts, the mother of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales was an otherwise unknown daughter of Rǫgnvaldr named Rhanullt.McDonald (2019) pp. 76, 85 n. 86; Smith, JB (2014) pp. 37–38; McDonald (2007b) p. 104. If correct, these sources could indicate that Llywelyn's father, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr married a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr in about 1220. Contemporary sources, however, show that Llywelyn's mother was Senana, an undoubted wife of Gruffydd. In yet another Welsh pedigree—one compiled by the herald and poet Lewys Dwnn—Rǫgnvaldr is stated have had an otherwise unknown son named Hywel.McDonald 2007 pp. 75–76, 104–105; Meyrick 1846 p. 94. Although the reliability of such late genealogical sources is suspect, Rǫgnvaldr's known dealings with leading Welsh dynasts could lend weight to the possibility that he had an otherwise unknown Welsh wife or concubine.McDonald 2007 pp. 75–76, 104–105. Coat of arms of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr as it appears on folio 170r of Cambridge Corpus Christi College 16 II (Chronica majora).Lewis (1987) p. 455; Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 016II (n.d.). Rǫgnvaldr was also responsible for the Welsh translation of mediaeval texts dealing with Charlemagne and Roland.Clancy (2012) pp. 22–23; Boyd (2011) p. 28; Hurlock (2011) pp. 48–57; Rejhon (1984) pp. 29–30, 71–74, 89; de Mandach (1983). There are ten surviving manuscripts, dating no later than the seventeenth century, which preserve the thirteenth- century Cân Rolant, the Welsh version of La chanson de Roland. Along with the Welsh versions of the twelfth-century texts Historia Karoli Magni et Rotholandi and Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne, Cân Rolant comprises part of the Welsh Charlemagne cycle.Rejhon (2017); Rejhon (1984) pp. 1–21, 1 n. 1. All but one of the ten manuscripts contain a colophon revealing that Rǫgnvaldr was the impetus behind the original translation.Rejhon (2017); Rejhon (1984) pp. 22–23, 29. The work appears to have taken place at some point after his accession, and possibly following the marriage of his daughter to Rhodri. The catalyst for the translations is uncertain. During the reign of his contemporary, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, many Anglo-Norman manuscripts were translated into Old Norse, including those that became the thirteenth- century Karlamagnús saga. Historia Karoli Magni et Rotholandi and Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne appear to have been known in Scandinavia by the twelfth century, and it is possible that Rǫgnvaldr became familiar with them whilst in Norway, leading him to commission a translation of his own. On the other hand, he could have also become familiar with the tales whilst in England.Rejhon (1984) p. 71–74. Rǫgnvaldr's familial links with the Welsh, and perhaps Cistercian connections between Mann and Wales, may account for his part in the translations into Welsh.Hurlock (2011) p. 49; Rejhon (1984) p. 74–75. The work itself was seemingly carried out at the Ceredigion monastery of Llanbadarn Fawr, once a centre of Welsh scholarship.Rejhon (2017); Hurlock (2011) p. 49; Davies (2000) p. 105; Rejhon (1984) pp. 74–75. Involvement in Ireland Although Rǫgnvaldr is not mentioned in the Irish annals, other historical sources indicate that he indeed had Irish connections.McDonald (2007b) pp. 117–120. For example, Orkneyinga saga notes that, when he lent military support to William in Caithness, Rǫgnvaldr led a large army drawn from Ireland.McDonald (2012) p. 157; McDonald (2008) p. 137; McDonald (2007a) pp. 55–56, 72; McDonald (2007b) pp. 118–120; Vigfusson (1887a) p. 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 195–196 § 114. Also linking Rǫgnvaldr to Ireland is Henry III's summons to Rǫgnvaldr, dated 16 January 1218, commanding him to explain the \\"excesses committed upon the people of our Lord the King, as well in England as in Ireland\\".McDonald (2007b) pp. 119, 142; Oram (2000) pp. 124–125; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Johnsen (1969) pp. 24–25; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 133; Oliver (1861) pp. 40–41; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 75; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 115. Baile suthach síth Emhna also reveals connections with the island. Although the poem undoubtedly exaggerates Rǫgnvaldr's feats, its claims of devastating raids into Ireland may not be complete fantasy, as evidenced by the summons.McDonald (2007a) p. 53; McDonald (2007b) pp. 117–120; Skene (1890) pp. 410–427; Bardic Poetry Database (n.d.) § 279. Baile suthach sith Eamhna (or \\"suthain�?) $. Mannequin of Rǫgnvaldr's sister, Affrica, at Carrickfergus Castle. The mannequin is looking through the window of the castle's great hall. The poem also alludes to Rǫgnvaldr's right to the kingship of Tara,Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 148, 156. and appears to evince the prospect of seizing power in Dublin.Byrne (2016) p. 162; McDonald (2008) p. 131; McDonald (2007b) pp. 119–120; Duffy (2002) p. 54. Rǫgnvaldr's antecessors were certainly closely associated with the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin.McDonald (2007a) p. 52; McDonald (2007b) pp. 117–118; Duffy (2002) pp. 54–56. However, with the kingdom's collapse at the hands of English adventurers in 1170, and the ongoing entrenchment of the English throughout Ireland itself, the Crovan dynasty found itself surrounded by this threatening, rising new power in the Irish Sea zone.McDonald (2008) pp. 135–136; McDonald (2007b) pp. 124–125; Duffy (1992) p. 133. Despite the dynasty's original opposition to the English in Dublin, it did not take long to realign itself with this new power,McDonald (2008) p. 136; McDonald (2007b) p. 125. as exemplified through a marital alliance between Rǫgnvaldr's sister, Affrica, and one of the most powerful incoming Englishmen, John de Courcy.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 145–146; McDonald (2008) p. 136; McDonald (2007b) p. 125; Duffy (2005); Duffy (2004a); Oram (2000) p. 105. In 1177, Courcy led an invasion of Ulaid (an area roughly encompassing what is today County Antrim and County Down). He reached Down (modern day Downpatrick), drove off Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe, King of Ulaid, consolidated his conquest, and ruled his lands with a certain amount of independence for about a quarter of a century.McDonald (2008) pp. 136–137; Crooks (2005); Duffy (2005); Duffy (2004a). Although the date of the marriage between Courcy and Affrica is uncertain, the union may well have attributed to his stunning successes in Ireland.McDonald (2008) pp. 137–138; McDonald (2007b) pp. 126–127; Duffy (1996b) p. 7. The rulers of Ulaid and those of Mann had a bitter past-history between them, and it is possible that Courcy's marital alliance with the Crovan dynasty was the catalyst of his assault upon the Ulaid. In fact, Guðrøðr Óláfsson formalised his marriage to Findguala in 1176/1177, and thereby bound his dynasty with the Meic Lochlainn of Cenél nEógain, another traditional foe of the Ulaid. Courcy would have almost certainly attempted to use such alignments to his advantage,McDonald (2008) pp. 137–138; McDonald (2007b) p. 127; Duffy (1995) pp. 25–26; Duffy (1993) pp. 58–59; Duffy (1991) pp. 54–56. whilst Guðrøðr Óláfsson would have used Courcy's campaigning against the Ulaid as a means of settling old scores.McDonald (2007b) p. 127; Duffy (2002) pp. 54–56. curtain wall, and early thirteenth-century keep of Dundrum Castle.Halpin; Newman (2006) pp. 83–85, 84 fig. 17. Rǫgnvaldr's forces assisted those of Courcy against the castle in 1205. Courcy's fall from power occurred in a series of conflicts with the English Crown between 1201 and 1204. By 1205 he was forced from Ireland altogether, and his lands were awarded to Hugh de Lacy. During Courcy's subsequent revolt within the year,Downham (2018) p. 245; McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007b) pp. 128–127; Smith, B (2006); Duffy (2005). he received military support from Rǫgnvaldr, his brother-in-law.Veach (2014) pp. 117–118; Oram (2011) p. 168; McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007a) p. 53; McDonald (2007b) pp. 128–127; Duffy (2005); McDonald (2004) p. 190; Oram (2000) p. 124; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) pp. 63–64; Macdonald; McQuillan; Young (n.d.) pp. 10–12 §§ 2.5.8–2.5.10. The Chronicle of Mann specifies that Courcy's massive force was reinforced by Rǫgnvaldr with one hundred ships, and states that they laid siege to a certain castle of \\"'\\", before being beaten back with the arrival of Walter de Lacy.Brown, DJF (2015) p. 9; McDonald (2012) p. 157; Oram (2011) p. 168; McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007a) pp. 62–63, 53; McDonald (2007b) p. 128; Flanagan (2004); McDonald (2004) p. 190; Oram (2000) p. 124; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) p. 64, 64 n. 86; Anderson (1922) pp. 363–365; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 80–83; Macdonald; McQuillan; Young (n.d.) pp. 10–11 § 2.5.8. The expedition is also recorded by the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé, which states that Courcy brought a fleet from the Isles to battle the Lacys. Although the expedition ultimately proved a failure, the source indicates that the surrounding countryside was plundered and destroyed by the invaders.Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1205.5; McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007a) p. 53; McDonald (2007b) pp. 128–129; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1205.5; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) pp. 63–64; Anderson (1922) p. 364 n. 4; Macdonald; McQuillan; Young (n.d.) pp. 10–11 § 2.5.8. The identity of the castle named by the chronicle is almost certainly Dundrum Castle,McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007b) p. 129; Duffy (2005); Duffy (1993) p. 63, 63 n. 86; Macdonald; McQuillan; Young (n.d.) pp. 9–12 § 2.5.6–2.5.10. which was possibly constructed by Courcy before 1203. The defeat of 1205 marks the downfall of Courcy, who never regained his Irish lands.McDonald (2008) p. 139; McDonald (2007b) p. 129. Relations with John of England Locations in Britain and Ireland relating to the life and times of Rǫgnvaldr. Rǫgnvaldr's involvement in Ireland, and his connection with Courcy, may have led to contact with the English kings John and Henry III.McDonald (2008) p. 140; McDonald (2007b) pp. 130–131; Oram (2000) p. 124. In fact, Courcy's final downfall may have been somewhat of a relief to Rǫgnvaldr, since it meant that he was no longer caught between conflicting loyalties he would owe to both the English Crown and brother-in-law.Oram (2011) p. 168. On 8 February 1205, the year of the attack on Dundrum, John took Rǫgnvaldr under his protection.McDonald (2008) p. 140; McDonald (2007a) p. 74; McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Oram (2000) p. 124; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Oliver (1861) p. 25; Hardy (1835) p. 50; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 44; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 84. Exactly a year later, John issued Rǫgnvaldr safe conduct for fifteen days to come to England for Easter (22 April 1206).Veach (2014) p. 118; McDonald (2008) p. 140; McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Bain (1881) p. 63 § 380; Oliver (1861) p. 26; Hardy (1835) p. 92; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 44; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 87. A further record dated 28 April reveals that Rǫgnvaldr rendered homage to John during this Easter sojourn, and states that the latter ordered the Sheriff of Lancaster to assign thirty marcates of land to Rǫgnvaldr.McDonald (2008) p. 140; McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Farrer (1902) p. 206; Oliver (1861) p. 27; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 88. Accordingly, the Lancashire Pipe Rolls reveal that the sheriff associated twenty librates of land with Rǫgnvaldr during the year spanning Michaelmas 1205 and Michaelmas 1206.McDonald (2008) p. 140; McDonald (2007) p. 131; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Bain (1881) p. 64 § 383; Farrer (1902) pp. 199, 206. Since the rolls do not name any estate associated with Rǫgnvaldr, he does not appear to have been assigned any lands, but rather a charge upon the ferm of the county. On 29 April, John ordered his treasurer to pay thirty marks to Rǫgnvaldr.McDonald (2008) pp. 140–141; McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Oliver (1861) p. 28; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 89. About a year later, on 17 June 1207, John ordered the sheriff to assign Rǫgnvaldr with twenty liberates of land,McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Oliver (1861) p. 29; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 90. a payment which is also confirmed by the Lancashire Pipe Rolls.McDonald (2007b) p. 131; Farrer (1902) p. 228. Fourteenth-century depiction of Fergus, Lord of Galloway as he is depicted in Leiden University Library Letterkunde 191 (Roman van Ferguut). Fergus was a grandfather of Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, and a great-grandfather of Alan fitz Roland, Thomas fitz Roland, and Rǫgnvaldr himself.Oram (2011) pp. xv tab. 4, xvi tab. 5. Donnchad, the FitzRolands, and Rǫgnvaldr were important agents of the English Crown in Ireland.Brown, DJF (2015) p. 22, 22 n. 126; Veach (2014) pp. 145–146; Pollock (2005) pp. 4, 26–27, 27 n. 138. Rǫgnvaldr's increasing interaction with the English Crown after Courcy's fall suggests that the English king not only orchestrated Courcy's undoing, but purposely detached Rǫgnvaldr from the latter. Such an act not only considerably weakened Courcy, but lessened the chance of a Lacy counterstroke against Rǫgnvaldr that could potentially destabilise the Irish Sea region. In fact, the collapse of Rǫgnvaldr's marital alliance with Llywelyn ap Iorwerth took place at about the same time, and it is possible that this breakup was masterminded by the English as well.Veach (2014) pp. 118, 121. In 1210, the Chronicle of Mann reports that John led five hundred ships to Ireland. Whilst Rǫgnvaldr and his men were absent from Mann, part of John's forces are recorded to have landed and ravaged it for a fortnight before departing with hostages.Oram (2011) p. 170; McDonald (2008) p. 141; McDonald (2007a) p. 74; McDonald (2007b) pp. 129, 133; Pollock (2005) pp. 11, 18–19; Oram (2000) p. 116; Duffy (1996a) p. 13; Anderson (1922) pp. 387–388; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 82–83. There is does not appear to be any other evidence of possibly poor relations between Rǫgnvaldr and John at this time.Oram (2011) p. 168; Pollock (2005) p. 19 n. 94. Since the men were clearly on friendly terms between 1205 and 1207, John's assault on the island does not appear to be connected to Rǫgnvaldr's earlier campaigning with (the then-disgraced) Courcy. Instead, it is likely that the devastation was related to John's souring relations with the Lacy and the Briouze families.McDonald (2008) p. 142; McDonald (2007b) pp. 132–132. In 1208, William de Briouze, with his wife and family, fled from John to Ireland, where they were harboured by the Lacys. When John arrived in Ireland in 1210, the Briouzes fled towards Scotland, and were apprehended in Galloway by Courcy's close associate and Rǫgnvaldr's kinsman Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick.Oram (2011) p. 169; McDonald (2008) p. 142; McDonald (2007b) p. 132; Pollock (2005) pp. 11–12, 18–19; Turner (2006); Holden (2001) p. 15; Oram (2000) p. 116; Duffy (1993) pp. 73, 75. Coat of arms of William de Briouze as it appears on folio 33v of Cambridge Corpus Christi College 16 II.Lewis (1987) p. 448; Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 016II (n.d.). A link between the flight of the Briouzes and Rǫgnvaldr appears in the thirteenth-century Histoire des ducs de Normandie et des rois d'Angleterre, which states that, whilst en route to Scotland just before their capture, the Briouzes stayed on Mann for four days.McDonald (2007b) p. 132; Duffy (1996a) pp. 13, 22–23; Anderson (1922) p. 387; Michel (1840) pp. 113–114. Although it is impossible to know for certain whether Rǫgnvaldr sanctioned the arrival of the fleeing Briouzes, their close connection with the Lacys, and Rǫgnvaldr's close connection with Courcy—a man who had been forced from his Irish lands by the Lacys—both strongly suggest that cooperation between Rǫgnvaldr and Briouze is unlikely.McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Pollock (2005) p. 18. In any case, the English depredations on Mann are corroborated by other sources, such as the Annals of Loch Cé,Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1210.7; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1210.7; Duffy (1996a) p. 13; Anderson (1922) p. 383 n. 4. and the continuation of twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum,Duffy (1996a) p. 13; Howlett (1885) p. 511. In his own account of events, John declared that he had learned of the capture of Briouze's wife and children whilst at Carrickfergus,Pollock (2005) pp. 11–12; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Oram (2000) p. 116; Duffy (1996a) pp. 13–14; Duffy (1993) pp. 73, 75; Anderson (1922) pp. 384–385 n. 4; Bain (1881) pp. 81–82 § 480; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 52. a statement which may hint that the attack on Mann was punitive in nature.McDonald (2007b) p. 133. If the attack was indeed a case of retaliation it may not have been due to Rǫgnvaldr's own involvement with enemies of the English Crown.Pollock (2005) pp. 18–19. The fleeing Briouzes were also accompanied by Hugh himself, but unlike them he managed to elude capture, and was temporarily harboured in Scotland by Ailín II, Earl of Lennox.Veach (2014) p. 121; Pollock (2005) pp. 11–12, 18. The Lacys' previous connections with Dublin and Ulster suggest that Hugh may have had supporters on Mann. In fact, his stay-over in Rǫgnvaldr's absence may have been enabled due to the fraternal discord between Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr. A correlation between the Lacys and the struggle between Óláfr and Rǫgnvaldr may be exemplified by a 1217 royal order directed at Hugh's half- brother, William Gorm de Lacy, commanding him to restore Carlingford Castle, and repay the damages which he had caused in capturing it.Duffy (1993) pp. 104–105, 105 n. 19; Sweetman (1875) p. 114 § 755. The fact that Rǫgnvaldr received restoration of his nearby knight's fee in 1219 could indicate that these lands had also been overrun and seized by the Lacys.Duffy (1993) p. 105 n. 19; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 205; Sweetman (1875) pp. 133–134 § 898; Oliver (1861) p. 47; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 79; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 124. Divided loyalties: England and Norway Coat of arms of Henry III, King of England as it appears on folio 100r of British Library Royal 14 C VII (Historia Anglorum).Lewis (1987) p. 461. In the years between the death of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway and the reign of Hákon, Norwegian power in the Isles was negligible due to an ongoing civil war in Norway.McDonald (2007b) pp. 135–136. In the mid twelfth century, however, during his visit to Norway, Rǫgnvaldr's father appears to have become a vassal of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway.McDonald (2007b) p. 135; Power (2005) p. 22; Johnsen (1969) p. 21. Certainly the twelfth-century Norman chronicler Robert de Torigni, Abbot of Mont Saint-Michel reported a mid-century meeting between Henry II, King of England, William, and the Bishop of the Isles, where it was stated that the kings of the Isles were obliged to pay the kings of Norway ten marks of gold upon the latter's accession.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 70–71; McDonald (2007b) p. 135; Power (2005) p. 22; Johnsen (1969) pp. 20–22; Lawrie (1910) pp. 114–115; Anderson (1908) p. 245; Howlett (1889) pp. 228–229. Whilst bound to the English Crown in 1210, Rǫgnvaldr appears to have found himself the target of renewed Norwegian hegemony in the Isles.McDonald (2007b) pp. 133–137. Specifically, the Icelandic annals reveal that a military expedition from Norway to the Isles was in preparation in 1209. The following year, the same source notes \\"warfare\\" in the Isles, and reveals that Iona was pillaged.McDonald (2012) p. 163; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Power (2005) p. 38; Oram (2000) p. 115; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 143 § 4; Storm (1977) p. 123; Anderson (1922) pp. 378, 381–382; Vigfusson (1878) pp. 366–367; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 523. These reports are corroborated by Bǫglunga sǫgur, a thirteenth-century saga-collection that survives in two versions. Both versions reveal that a fleet of Norwegians plundered in the Isles, and the shorter version notes how men of the Birkibeinar and the Baglar—two competing sides of the Norwegian civil war—decided to recoup their financial losses with a twelve-ship raiding expedition into the Isles.Michaelsson (2015) p. 30 ch. 17; Beuermann (2012) p. 1; McDonald (2012) p. 163; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–143; McDonald (2007b) p. 133; Power (2005) p. 38; Beuermann (2002) p. 420 n. 6; Oram (2000) p. 115; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 143 § 4; Anderson (1922) pp. 378–381, 379 n. 2; Jónsson (1916) p. 468 ch. 18; Fornmanna Sögur (1835) pp. 192–195. The longer version states that \\"'\\" (styled \\"'\\") and \\"'\\" (styled \\"'\\") had not paid their taxes due to the Norwegian kings.

The ' (tax) that Rǫgnvaldr and his son rendered to Ingi appears to be the same tribute that Robert noted in his account.McDonald (2008) p. 143; McDonald (2007b) pp. 134–135; Power (2005) p. 39; Johnsen (1969) pp. 23–24. The submission of the Islesmen appears to have been undertaken in the context of the strengthening position of the Norwegian Crown following the settlement between the Birkibeinar and Baglar,Beuermann (2011) p. 125; Beuermann (2010) p. 106; McDonald (2008) pp. 142–144; McDonald (2007b) pp. 134–135. and the simultaneous weakening of the Crovan dynasty due to internal infighting.Beuermann (2010) p. 106. The destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Norway due to Rǫgnvaldr's recalcitrance in terms of, not only his Norwegian obligations, but his recent reorientation towards the English Crown.McDonald (2007b) p. 135. The fact that Ingi turned his attention to the Isles so soon after peace was brokered in Norway may well indicate the importance that he placed on his relations with Rǫgnvaldr and his contemporaries in the Isles.Beuermann (2011) p. 125. Rǫgnvaldr may have also used his journey as a means to safeguard the kingship against the claims of Óláfr.Williams, DGE (1997) p. 115. His presence there may explain his absence from Mann during the ravaging of the island by the English. In fact, Rǫgnvaldr's submission to Ingi could have been contributed to the English attack, as it may have given the English an incentive to devastate Rǫgnvaldr's lands because he had bound himself to John only a few years previous.Oram (2011) pp. 168–170; Beuermann (2010) p. 106 n. 20; McDonald (2008) p. 144; McDonald (2007b) p. 136. Although John had originally installed Hugh as Earl of Ulster, he proceeded to dismantle the lordship after Hugh gave refuge to the Briouzes. The ravaging of Mann, therefore, may have been a further demonstration of English royal power directed at a disloyal vassal. If this was indeed the case, Rǫgnvaldr's submission to the Norwegian Crown—although apparently undertaken to safeguard his kingdom—clearly resulted in severe repercussions.Oram (2011) pp. 168–170. Enduring links with England Thirteenth-century depiction of John, King of England as he appears on folio 9r of British Library Royal 14 C VII. Numerous sources reveal that, in the years following the ravaging of Mann and plundering of the Isles, Rǫgnvaldr bound himself closer to the English Crown.McDonald (2008) pp. 144–145; McDonald (2007b) pp. 137–143. Whilst at Lambeth on 16 May 1212,Pollock (2015) p. 56 n. 36; McDonald (2008) p. 144; McDonald (2007b) p. 137; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Johnsen (1969) p. 24; Munch; Goss (1874b) p. 289 § 7; Oliver (1861) pp. 31–32; Hardy (1837) p. 191; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 51; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 94; Document 1/15/6 (n.d.). for instance, during what was likely his second visit to England in six years,McDonald (2007b) p. 137. Rǫgnvaldr formally swore that he was John's liegeman. Rǫgnvaldr's visit to England is corroborated by a record, dated 20 May, regarding the English Crown's payment of ten marks for conducting Rǫgnvaldr home.McDonald (2007b) p. 137; Oliver (1861) p. 30; Cole (1844) p. 232. Further corroboration is provided by the record, dated 16 May, concerning the release of some of Rǫgnvaldr's men who had been held in custody at Porchester and Dover.McDonald (2008) p. 144, 144 n. 68; McDonald (2007b) p. 137, 137 n. 75; Oliver (1861) p. 33; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 95. In another record, also dated 16 May, John authorised his seneschals, governors, and bailiffs in Ireland to come to Rǫgnvaldr's aid in the event that his territory was threatened by \\"' or others\\", since Rǫgnvaldr had bound himself to do the same against John's own enemies.McDonald (2008) pp. 144–145, 144 n. 68; McDonald (2007a) pp. 74–75; McDonald (2007b) p. 137, 137 n. 75; Pollock (2005) pp. 26–27; Duffy (2002) p. 49; Duffy (1993) p. 65; Johnsen (1969) p. 24; Sweetman (1875) p. 70 § 429; Oliver (1861) p. 34; Hardy (1835) p. 92. The record of \\"'\\" or Vikings in this order may refer to the Norwegian raiders, like those who plundered the Isles in 1210.McDonald (2008) p. 145; McDonald (2007a) p. 75 n. 40; McDonald (2007b) p. 138. This particular source reveals that, not only was Rǫgnvaldr protected by John, but that he was also obligated to defend John's interests in the Irish Sea region.McDonald (2007b) pp. 138–139. As such, Rǫgnvaldr's security was enhanced by English assistance, and John's influence was extended over the Isles at the expense of the Scots.Duffy (1993) p. 65. Carlingford, where Rǫgnvaldr was granted lands from the English Crown for the service of a knight. At the time, Carlingford was part of Ulster, however today it located in County Louth. Yet another transaction dated 16 May, in return for the homage and service that he rendered to the English Crown, Rǫgnvaldr and his heirs received a grant consisting of one knight's fee of land at Carlingford, and one hundred measures of corn to be paid yearly at Drogheda for the service of a knight.Veach (2018) p. 173; McDonald (2016) p. 341; Pollock (2015) p. 56 n. 35; Wadden (2014) p. 36; McDonald (2008) pp. 144–145, 144 n. 68, 145 n. 71; McDonald (2007a) pp. 53, 75; McDonald (2007b) pp. 137–138, 137 n. 75, 138 n. 78; Power (2005) p. 46; Davey, P (2002) p. 91; Duffy (2002) p. 54; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) p. 64; Power (1986) p. 130; Johnsen (1969) p. 24; Sweetman (1875) p. 70 § 428; Oliver (1861) pp. 35–36; Hardy (1837) p. 186; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 93. The grant gave Rǫgnvaldr a valuable foothold in Ireland, and provided his powerful galley-fleet with an additional safe haven.McDonald (2008) p. 146; McDonald (2007a) pp. 53, 75; McDonald (2007b) p. 139; Duffy (2002) p. 54. The precise location of the territory granted to Rǫgnvaldr is unrecorded and unknown.McDonald (2007b) p. 139. Carlingford had until recently been a power centre of Hugh, and Rǫgnvaldr's grant may fit into the context of filling the power vacuum following the destruction of the Lacy lordship.McDonald (2008) p. 146; McDonald (2007b) p. 139. Rǫgnvaldr's gifts from the English Crown may fit into the context of John attempting to offset interference from the Philip Augustus, King of France. At about this time, the French Crown had orchestrated a Franco-Welsh alliance in an attempt to divert the English to deal with a Welsh uprising rather than focus their forces upon the Continent and France in particular.Pollock (2015) pp. 54–58, 56 n. 35. In fact, there is evidence that Norman ships were active off Wales in 1210.Pollock (2015) p. 54; Church (1998) p. 49 n. 28; Hardy (1844a) p. 227. Although John had come to terms with Llywelyn ap Iorwerth in 1211, the following year the latter formed a concord with Philip. By May 1212, John succeeded in gaining the support of several foreign lords, such as the counts of Bar, Boulogne, and Flanders, the dukes of Brabant and Limburg, the Holy Roman Emperor, and Rǫgnvaldr himself. Despite these overtures, however, the Welsh uprisings of 1211 and 1212, as well as an English revolt in 1212, all succeeded in keeping English forces from invading France. Seal of Alan fitz Roland, Rǫgnvaldr's kinsman and ally. As a consequence of Rǫgnvaldr's vassalage to the English Crown, and his role as guardian of the English seaways, it is probable that Islesmen were involved in far fewer predatory actions along the English and Irish coasts.McDonald (2007a) p. 54. At about the same time, several south-western Scottish magnates received grants in the north of Ireland. These included three of Rǫgnvaldr's Meic Fergusa kinsmen: Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway, Alan's brother Thomas fitz Roland, Earl of Atholl, and Donnchad. Such grants appear to have been part of a coordinated campaign of the English and Scottish kings to gain authority over outlying territories where royal influence was limited.Brown, DJF (2015) p. 22, 22 n. 126; Veach (2014) pp. 145–146; McDonald (2008) pp. 146–147; McDonald (2007b) pp. 140–141; Stringer (1998) pp. 85–88. A record dated 3 January 1214 appears to confirm the English Crown's intentions of protecting the Islesmen, as it prohibits certain \\"mariners of Ireland\\" from entering Rǫgnvaldr's territories at his loss.McDonald (2008) p. 145; McDonald (2007b) p. 138; Pollock (2005) pp. 26–27; McDonald (1997) p. 87; Duffy (1993) p. 104; Johnsen (1969) p. 24; Sweetman (1875) p. 80 § 502; Oliver (1861) p. 37; Hardy (1835) p. 108. The English pledges of protection of Rǫgnvaldr and his Irish holdings suggest that he was under immediate pressure at this period. It is possible, therefore, that the 1211/1212 seaborne devastation of Derry by Thomas fitz Roland, and the unidentified sons of Ragnall—apparently Ruaidrí and Domnall—was undertaken in support of Rǫgnvaldr's interests in Ireland.Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1211.3; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1211.3; Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1211.7; Annala Uladh (2005) § 1212.4; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1211.7; Pollock (2005) pp. 26–27, 27 n. 138; Annala Uladh (2003) § 1212.4. In fact, Thomas fitz Roland and Ruaidrí ransacked Derry again in 1213/1214,Duffy (2007) p. 10; Ross, A (2007); Pollock (2005) p. 27; Oram (2000) p. 117; Duffy (1993) p. 67. and it is also possible that the raids were conducted in the interests of both the Scottish and English Crowns, and specifically aimed at limiting Irish support of the Meic Uilleim dissidents.Oram (2011) p. 171; Ross, A (2007); Oram (2004c); Ross, AD (2003) pp. 198–199; Oram (2000) p. 117; Stringer (1998) pp. 87–88; Duffy (1993) pp. 78–79. If these attacks were indeed directed against political enemies of the Scottish and English Crowns, it is not improbable that Rǫgnvaldr and his forces were also involved.McDonald (2008) pp. 146–147. Thirteenth-century depiction of Henry III as he appears on folio 9r of British Library Royal 14 C VII. John died in October 1216, and was succeeded by his young son, Henry III.McDonald (2007b) p. 142. On one hand, the English summons of Rǫgnvaldr, dated 16 January 1218, in which he was ordered to amend certain \\"excesses\\" committed upon Henry III's men in Ireland and England, could be evidence that Islesmen took advantage of the somewhat fractured English realm by plundering the coasts of England and Ireland. If this was indeed the case, there is no further evidence of any such depredations.McDonald (2007b) p. 142; Johnsen (1969) pp. 24–25; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 133; Oliver (1861) pp. 40–41; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 75; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 115. On the other hand, the \\"excesses\\" could specifically relate to an instance reported by the Annals of Loch Cé, in which Irish herring-fishermen are stated to have committed violence on Mann, and were slain as a consequence of their actions.Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1217.2; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1217.2; Duffy (1993) pp. 103–104. Later in May, the English Crown commanded that Rǫgnvaldr was to be given safe passage to England in order account for the misconduct of his men.Hudson 2004 p. 62; Duffy (1993) p. 104; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 150; Bain (1881) p. 122 § 696; Sweetman (1875) p. 123 § 828; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 116. Whether Rǫgnvaldr actually travelled there that year is unknown, although various records reveal that he certainly did so the following year. For example, he was granted safe passage by the English Crown on 24 September 1219.McDonald (2007b) p. 142; Oram (2000) p. 88; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) pp. 204–205; Oliver (1861) pp. 43–44; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 79. Evidence of Rǫgnvaldr's activity in England survives in references of homage rendered to Henry III. One such record shows that, in late September, Rǫgnvaldr rendered homage to Henry III, and received the same fief that John had given him.Duffy (2002) p. 54; Oram (2000) p. 88; Duffy (1993) pp. 104, 105 n. 19; Johnsen (1969) p. 25; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 205; Sweetman (1875) pp. 133–134 § 898; Oliver (1861) p. 47; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 79; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 124. In another record of his homage the English Crown added the qualification: \\"But if our enemies, or his, shall rebel against us, and him, to the loss of our or his land, then you are to be earnest in your help, for the defence of our land and of his, to our safety and convenience, so long as he shall keep himself faithful towards us\\".McDonald (2007b) pp. 142–143; Anderson (1922) p. 439 n. 1; Patent Rolls of the Reign of Henry III (1901) p. 205; Oliver (1861) pp. 45–46; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 79. Therefore, whatever \\"excesses\\" Rǫgnvaldr's men had committed in the past, the surviving evidence reveals that by 1219 he was again amicably allied to the English king.McDonald (2007b) p. 143. Under the protection of the Pope The Temple Church of London. In September 1219, whilst in London at the Temple Church, Rǫgnvaldr surrendered Mann to the papacy, swore to perform homage for the island, and promised to pay twelve marks sterling in perpetuity as tribute.Wiedemann (2018) pp. 512–513; McDonald (2016) p. 342; Wiedemann (2016) pp. 220–221, 224–225 n. 67, 230; Crawford, BE (2014) p. 73; McDonald (2007b) pp. 143–144, 186, 190; Power (2005) p. 40; Watt (2000) p. 40 n. 62; Richter (1971) p. 212; Johnsen (1969) pp. 25–26; Anderson (1922) pp. 427 n. 1, 439 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 290–293 § 8; Theiner (1864) pp. vi, 11 § 26; Oliver (1861) pp. 53–57; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 pp. 78–79; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 123; Document 1/15/7 (n.d.). Rǫgnvaldr's submission was accepted, on behalf of Pope Honorius III, by the papal legate to England, Pandulf, Bishop-elect of Norwich.McDonald (2016) p. 342; McDonald (2007b) pp. 149, 186; Richter (1971) p. 212; Johnsen (1969) pp. 25–26; Anderson (1922) p. 455 n. 2; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 301–302 § 13; Theiner (1864) pp. vi, 21–22 § 51; Oliver (1861) pp. 64–66; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 7 § 11; Document 2/139/75 (n.d.). Such a submission was not unprecedented at the time. For example, John had surrendered his kingdom to the papacy through Pandulf about six years beforehand,Wiedemann (2016) pp. 221, 224–225 n. 67, 230; Gillingham (2010); McDonald (2007b) p. 144; Power (2005) p. 40; Vincent (2004); Richter (1971) pp. 211–212. whilst facing not only a major crisis from within his own realm, but an imminent invasion by Louis VIII, King of France from without.Gillingham (2010). Late thirteenth- century fresco depicting of Pope Honorius III. The precise impetus behind Rǫgnvaldr's submission is uncertain, although it may well have been related to the threat of ever-strengthening Norwegian kingship.McDonald (2007b) pp. 146–147. Certainly Hákon had only acceded to the Norwegian kingship two years previously, and by the early part of his reign the civil warring within his realm began to wane.McDonald (2007b) p. 146; Helle (2003) p. 385. In his submission, Rǫgnvaldr stated that the kingdom was his by hereditary right, and that he held it without any obligation to anyone.McDonald (2007b) pp. 143–144, 146, 148; Johnsen 1969 p. 25. This contradicts the statement by Bǫglunga sǫgur, which declare that he and his son swore loyalty to Hákon and took his kingdom in fief of the latter.Johnsen (1969) p. 23. The submission, therefore, may have been a means by which Rǫgnvaldr attempted to release himself from Norwegian overlordship.Power (2005) p. 40; Johnsen (1969) p. 23. On 23 September 1220, Henry III commanded that the Irish justiciary and baronage should lend assistance to Rǫgnvaldr against his enemies.Duffy (1993) p. 104; Sweetman (1875) pp. 134–135 § 902. Furthermore, a royal order addressed to Henry III's administrators in Ireland, dated 4 November 1220, commanded Henry III's men to render military aid to Rǫgnvaldr, since the latter had provided evidence that Hákon was plotting to invade his island-kingdom.Duffy (2007) p. 13; McDonald (2007b) pp. 146–147; Duffy (2002) p. 49; Duffy (1993) p. 104; Sweetman (1875) p. 149 § 976; Oliver (1861) pp. 58–59; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 132. Not long after this enlistment of English support, the Annals of Loch Cé and the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters report the death of Diarmait Ua Conchobair at the hands of Thomas fitz Roland in 1221. These sources state that Diarmait was in the process of assembling a fleet in the Isles to reclaim the kingship of Connacht.Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1220.2; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1220.2; Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1221.7; Duffy (2007) pp. 9–10; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1221.7; Duffy (1993) p. 103. There is a possibility, however, that his actions in the Isles were connected to the Norwegian threat feared by Rǫgnvaldr.Duffy (2007) p. 13. In fact, Diarmait's kinsman, Áed na nGall Ua Conchobair, appears to have attempted the procurement of Hákon's assistance at a later date.Duffy (2007) pp. 13, 22–23. Rǫgnvaldr's papal submission may have also been linked to his feud with Óláfr. For example, in the last hours of his life, John appealed to Pope Innocent III to ensure the succession of his young son, Henry III. Although the chronology of dissension between Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr is not entirely clear, the hostilities which entangled Rǫgnvaldr's son broke out in the 1220s. Rǫgnvaldr, therefore, may have intended to secure, not only his own kingship, but also the future succession of his son.McDonald (2007b) pp. 147–148, 186. In any case, it is unknown how well Rǫgnvaldr kept his obligations to the papacy.McDonald (2007b) p. 149; Johnsen 1969 p. 26. The limited surviving evidence of communications between Mann and Rome appear to show that his commitments were not taken up by his successors.McDonald (2007b) p. 149. Nevertheless, centuries after his death, Rǫgnvaldr's deal with the papacy was commemorated by a fresco in the Vatican Archives.McDonald (2007b) pp. 31, 144; Moore, TM (1966). Reunification and Scottish machinations bishop gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 158 fig. 3a, 186 fig. 13. Upon Óláfr's return from his pilgrimage, the Chronicle of Mann records that Rǫgnvaldr had him marry \\"Lauon\\", the sister of his own wife. Rǫgnvaldr then granted Lewis and Harris back to Óláfr, where the newly-weds proceeded to live until the arrival of Reginald, Bishop of the Isles. The chronicle claims that the bishop disapproved of the marriage on the grounds that Óláfr had formerly had a concubine who was a cousin of Lauon. A synod was then assembled, after which the marriage is stated to have been nullified.McDonald (2019) pp. 61, 63, 66; McDonald (2016) pp. 339, 342; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2007b) pp. 78–79, 116, 152, 190; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Murray (2005) p. 290 n. 23; Pollock (2005) p. 27, 27 n. 138; Brown, M (2004) pp. 76–78; Duffy (2004c); Woolf (2003) p. 178; Oram (2000) p. 125; Sellar (1997–1998); McDonald (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) pp. 457–458; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 84–87. Although the chronicle alleges that Óláfr's marriage was doomed for being within a prohibited degree of kinship, there is evidence to suggest that the real reason for its demise was the animosity between the half- brothers.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; McDonald (2007b) p. 152. For example, Reginald and Óláfr appear to have been closely associated, as the chronicle notes that, not only was Reginald was a son of Óláfr's sister, but that Óláfr had warmly greeted Reginald when the latter arrived on Lewis and Harris. Furthermore, it was Reginald who had instigated the annulment.McDonald (2007b) p. 190. In fact, after the previous Bishop of the Isles died in 1217, Reginald and Nicholas de Meaux, Abbot of Furness had vied for the office of bishop. Whilst Reginald appears to have enjoyed the support of Óláfr, Rǫgnvaldr appears to have supported the bid of Reginald's rival, Nicholas.McDonald (2007b) pp. 189–192. queen gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 157 fig. 2b, 163 fig. 8f, 188 fig. 15.

The chronicle describes him as a nobleman from Kintyre,McDonald (2019) pp. 60, 66; McDonald (2016) p. 339; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram (2013); McDonald (2007a) p. 73 n. 35; McDonald (2007b) pp. 78, 116; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock (2005) p. 27 n. 138; Duffy (2004c); Woolf (2003) p. 178; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 457; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 84–85. which suggests that he was a member of the Meic Somairle, since sources concerning this kindred link them with Kintyre more than any other region.McDonald (2019) pp. 60–61; McDonald (2007a) p. 73 n. 35; Woolf (2007) p. 81. The father-in-law, therefore, may well have been Rǫgnvaldr's first cousin Ragnall,Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2007b) pp. 117, 152; Woolf (2007) p. 81. or Ragnall's son RuaidríMcDonald (2019) pp. 60–61; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 189; McDonald (2007b) pp. 117 n. 68, 152; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock (2005) pp. 4, 27, 27 n. 138; Woolf (2004) p. 107; Woolf (2003) p. 178; Oram (2000) p. 125.—both of whom appear to have been styled \\"Lord of Kintyre\\" in contemporary sourcesMcDonald (2007b) p. 117; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 219 § 3; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 565–565; Paul (1882) pp. 670 § 3136, 678 § 3170; Document 3/30/1 (n.d.); Document 3/32/1 (n.d.); Document 3/32/2 (n.d.).—or possibly Ragnall's younger son, Domnall.Woolf (2007) p. 82. It is conceivable that the first union was undertaken before 1210,Woolf (2007) p. 81. perhaps not long after 1200 considering the fact that Guðrøðr Dond—a product of Rǫgnvaldr's marriage—was apparently an adult by 1223 and had fathered at least one son by this date.Oram (2013). The unions themselves appear to have been orchestrated in an effort to patch up relations between the Meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty, neighbouring kindreds who had bitterly contested the kingship of the Isles for about sixty years.Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2007b) p. 117; Woolf (2007) p. 81. In fact, it is possible that Rǫgnvaldr's kingship was formally recognised by Ruaidrí,Oram (2013) ch. 4; Woolf (2007) p. 81. the apparent leading Meic Somairle dynast since Áengus' death in 1210,Oram (2013) ch. 4; Woolf (2007) pp. 80–81. who thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom of the Isles. Since the majority of Ruaidrí's territories appear to have been mainland possessions, it is very likely that the Scottish Crown regarded this reunification as a threat to its own claims of overlordship of Argyll. In fact, it is possible that the Scots' release of Óláfr in 1214 was intended to cause dynastic discord in the Isles. If that was indeed the case, then the Scottish Crown's machinations had temporarily come to nought because of Óláfr's reconciliation and arraigned marriage.Oram (2013) ch. 4. Civil war and kin-strife rook gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6g, 185 fig. 12. Once freed from his arranged marriage, the Chronicle of Mann states that Óláfr proceeded to marry Cristina, daughter of Ferchar mac an tSacairt.McDonald (2019) pp. 61, 66; McDonald (2016) p. 339; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram (2013); McDonald (2007b) pp. 79, 152–153, 190; Murray (2005) p. 290 n. 23; Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 125; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 458; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 86–87. The latter emerges from historical obscurity in 1215, and by the mid 1220s—about the time of Cristina and Óláfr's marriage—Alexander II, King of Scotland rewarded Ferchar with the Earldom of Ross for meritorious service to the Scottish Crown.McDonald (2007b) p. 153; Pollock (2005) p. 24, 24 n. 122. The collapse of Óláfr's previous Meic Somairle marriage took place at about the time that Ruaidrí was seemingly ejected from Kintyre by the forces of Alexander II, King of Scotland in 1221–1222. Óláfr's subsequent realignment with Ferchar—Alexander's protégé—not only appears to evince Óláfr's recognition of the shift of power in north-western Scotland,Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 189; Oram (2000) p. 125. but may also signal Rǫgnvaldr's loss of support from the Scottish Crown.McDonald (2007b) p. 153. If the chronicle is to be believed, Óláfr's separation from Lauon enraged her sister, who surreptitiously tricked her son, Guðrøðr Dond, into attacking Óláfr. Following what he thought were his father's orders, Guðrøðr Dond gathered a force on Skye and proceeded to Lewis and Harris, where the chronicle records that he laid waste to most of the island. Óláfr is said to have only narrowly escaped with a few men, and to have fled to the protection of his father-in-law on the mainland in Ross. Óláfr is stated to have been followed into exile by Páll Bálkason, a sheriff on Skye who refused to take up arms against Óláfr. The chronicle then indicates that the two landed on Skye, and learned where Guðrøðr Dond was stationed, and defeated him in battle. The latter's captured followers were put to death, whilst Guðrøðr Dond himself was blinded and castrated. Although the chronicle maintains that Óláfr was unable to prevent this torture,Oram (2013); McDonald (2012) p. 155; McDonald (2007b) pp. 79–80; Broderick (2003); Oram (2000) p. 125; Gade (1994) p. 199; Anderson (1922) pp. 458–459; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 86–89. the Icelandic annals record that Óláfr was indeed responsible for his nephew's plight.McDonald (2007b) p. 80; Storm (1977) p. 126; Anderson (1922) pp. 454–455; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 526; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 526. The name of Guðrøðr Dond as it appears on folio 163v of AM 47 fol: \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 558 ch. 169; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). Although Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar (including this excerpt) accords him an epithet meaning \\"black\\", the Chronicle of Mann accords him another meaning \\"brown\\".McDonald (2007b) p. 86, 86 n. 93; Duffy (2002) p. 191 n. 18; Megaw (1976) pp. 16–17; Anderson (1922) pp. 472, 472 n. 5, 478; Dasent (1894) p. 154 ch. 167; Vigfusson (1887b) p. 148 ch. 167; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 92–93. Mutilation and killing of high status kinsmen during power-struggles was not an unknown phenomenon in the peripheral-regions of the British Isles during the High Middle Ages.McDonald (2019) p. 73; McDonald (2007b) pp. 96–98; pp. 96–98; Gillingham (2004). In only the century-and-a-half of its existence, at least nine members of the Crovan dynasty perished from mutilation or assassination.McDonald (2007b) p. 96. As such, there is reason to regard this vicious internecine violence as the Crovan dynasty's greatest weakness.McDonald (2019) pp. 72–73; McDonald (2007b) p. 91. The tribulations inflicted upon Guðrøðr seem to exemplify Óláfr's intent to wrest what he regarded as his birthright from Rǫgnvaldr's bloodline. It is unknown why Rǫgnvaldr had not similarly neutralised Óláfr when he had the chance years before in 1208, although it may have had something to do with international relations. For example, it is possible that his act of showing leniency to Óláfr had garnered Scottish support against the threat of Norwegian overlordship. In any case, the neutralisation of Guðrøðr Dond appears to mark a turning point in the struggle between the Óláfr and Rǫgnvaldr.McDonald (2019) p. 67; McDonald (2012) p. 155. Roughly about this point in time, correspondence between Joan, Queen of Scotland and her brother, Henry III, reveals that the Norwegian Crown was rumoured to have been planning a naval expedition west-over-sea. Although Joan's letter places this campaign in the context of a threat to English interests in Ireland, it may be more likely that Hákon's attention was focused upon the escalating situation in the Isles.Oram (2013); Oram (2000) p. 125. One possibility is that the queen's correspondence is evidence that Óláfr had appealed to Hákon for supported against Rǫgnvaldr.Oram (2000) p. 125. The kin-strife largely took place on Skye and Lewis and Harris, islands that were clearly important within the kingdom. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that the kingdom's northern territories were granted by reigning kings to heir-apparents or disaffected dynasts.McDonald (2012) p. 154; McDonald (2007b) p. 94. For example, during the eleventh-century reign of the dynasty's founder, Guðrøðr Crovan, the northern portion of the realm may have been governed by Guðrøðr Crovan's succeeding son, Lǫgmaðr.McDonald (2019) p. 74; McDonald (2007b) pp. 92, 94. The fact that Rǫgnvaldr was residing in the Hebrides when his father died in 1187 may indicate that, despite the chronicle's claims to the contrary, Rǫgnvaldr was indeed the rightful heir to the kingship.McDonald (2007b) p. 94; Oram (2000) p. 105. Furthermore, since Rǫgnvaldr's son is recorded on Skye, the possibility exists that he resided there as his father's heir-apparent. Rǫgnvaldr's grant of Lewis and Harris to Óláfr may, therefore, indicate that Óláfr was at least temporarily regarded as Rǫgnvaldr's rightful successor. On the other hand, it is also possible that Rǫgnvaldr's grant was given in the context of appeasing a disgruntled dynast passed over for the kingship.McDonald (2007b) p. 94. In any event, it is apparent that such territorial fragmentation would have severely weakened the realm.McDonald (2007b) p. 95. Contested episcopate The name of Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles as it appears on folio 50v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"Cristinus\\".Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114–115; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Cristinus seems to have been a Meic Somairle appointee, and was evidently replaced by a bishop aligned with the Crovan dynasty early in Rǫgnvaldr's reign. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction within Rǫgnvaldr's realm was the far- flung Diocese of the Isles. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the origins of the diocese may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium.Woolf (2003) pp. 171, 180. In the mid twelfth century, during the reign of Rǫgnvaldr's father, the diocese came to be incorporated into the newly established Norwegian Archdiocese of Niðaróss.Davey, PJ (2006c); Woolf (2003) p. 174. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal subjection to Norway—appears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.Davey, PJ (2006a); Davey (2006c). Before the close of the twelfth century, however, evidence of a new ecclesiastical jurisdiction—the Diocese of Argyll—begins to emerge during ongoing contentions between the Meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty.MacDonald (2013) pp. 31–33. A bishop gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 159 fig. 4d. The mitre depicted on this piece is that of a mid twelfth- to late twelfth- century bishop.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 159 fig. 4, 192 tab. 5, 193. The pieces are likely to have been crafted in Niðaróss (now known as Trondheim).McDonald (2012) pp. 168–169, 182 n. 175; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 197–198. Some of the pieces may have been gifts from the Archbishop of Niðaróss to the Bishop of the Isles during the reign of Rǫgnvaldr's father.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 152. In the early 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was probably a Meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael, a Manxman who appears to have been backed by Rǫgnvaldr.Beuermann (2014) pp. 92–93; MacDonald (2013) pp. 31–33; Beuermann (2012); Woolf (2003) pp. 175–177; McDonald (1997) p. 210; Watt (1994) pp. 111–114, 118; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114–115. The tenure of Cristinus seems to have spanned at least two decades during a sustained period of Meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at the time of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under the then-recently enthroned Rǫgnvaldr.MacDonald (2013) pp. 31–33; Beuermann (2012); Watt (1994) p. 118. After Michael's death in 1203, a certain Koli is recorded to have been consecrated in 1210. The situation between this span of years is uncertain.Woolf (2003) p. 177; Beuermann (2002) p. 420 n. 6. On one hand, it is possible that the see was vacant between these years. On the other hand, Koli could have been elected bishop in 1203, but only consecrated in 1210. Another possibility is that the see was administered from Lismore—the future seat of the Diocese of Argyll—under the ultimate authority of Áengus, the aforementioned Meic Somairle dynast slain in 1210.Woolf (2003) p. 177. There is also a possibility that Koli's consecration was connected to the attack on Iona in 1209/1210.Beuermann (2012); Anderson (1922) pp. 381–382 n. 4. Not only does the Norwegian expedition appear to have compelled Rǫgnvaldr and his son to submit to the Norwegian Crown in 1210, but it also made landfall in Orkney, and brought back to Norway the joint Orcadian earls and their bishop.Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 72–73; Beuermann (2012). The entire undertaking, therefore, may have been designed to reassert Norwegian overlordship over both secular and ecclesiastical authorities in Norwegian satellites overseas. If correct, the voyage would seem to have been orchestrated by both Ingi and his chief prelate, Þórir Guðmundarson, Archbishop of Niðaróss. Although the Meic Somairle controversially refounded Iona at the turn of the century, and further secured its independence from the Diocese of the Isles by placing it under the protection of the papacy, the Norwegian sack of the island may not have been a sanctioned act One possibility is that a visit to the island by the Norwegian delegation disastrously deteriorated into otherwise unplanned violence.Beuermann (2012). The next bishop after Koli was Reginald.Woolf (2003) p. 178. Although Reginald's rival for the episcopate, Nicholas, is recorded to have gained the support of the communities of Furness and Rushen, he does not appear to have ever occupied the see.McDonald (2007b) p. 189; Brownbill (1919) pp. 711–712 § 6; Beck (1844) p. 169; Document 2/11/5 (n.d.). In fact, Nicholas appears to have spent much of his time in Rome, since correspondence from the papacy to Walter de Gray, Archbishop of York, concerning Nicholas' final resignation, states that the latter had long been exiled from his see because \\"the lord of the land and others\\" were \\"altogether opposed to him\\".McDonald (2007b) pp. 189–190; Raine (1894) pp. 122–123; Oliver (1861) pp. 67–68. As early as November 1219, papal correspondence reveals that the pope had urged the leading men of the Isles to accept Nicholas' episcopacy.McDonald (2007b) pp. 190–191; Theiner (1864) pp. vi, 14 § 31; Document 2/139/35 (n.d.). St Oran's Chapel, the oldest intact building on Iona,Power (2013) p. 65. dates to the mid twelfth century, and may have been built by either the Meic Somairle or the Crovan dynasty.McDonald (2012) p. 156. Rǫgnvaldr's remarkably warm relations with the papacy, and his deteriorating relationship with Óláfr, could be evidence that the papal correspondence in support of Nicholas was directed at Óláfr instead of Rǫgnvaldr. Further indication of Rǫgnvaldr's support of Nicholas may be his renewal of the rights of St Mary's Abbey, Furness to elect the Bishop of the Isles.McDonald (2007b) p. 191; Brownbill (1919) p. 711 § 5; Oliver (1861) pp. 17–18; Document 1/15/1 (n.d.). The English Crown's warning to Óláfr about harming the monks of Furness could betray some sort of grievance with the community, whilst Rǫgnvaldr's burial at Furness appears show evidence his own affinity with the community. The controversy over the appointment of bishops, therefore, appears to have been yet another aspect of ongoing kin-strife within the Crovan dynasty. In fact, the final resignation of Nicholas in 1224 corresponds to the realignment of the kingdom between Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr, and the whole dispute coincides with the Óláfr's gradual successes against Rǫgnvaldr.McDonald (2007b) p. 191. In any case, Reginald's successor was a man named John who apparently died in an accident not long afterwards. The next bishop was Simon, a man consecrated in 1226 by the Archbishop of Niðaróss, and whose tenure outlived both Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr. Alliance with Alan of Galloway Ruinous Cruggleton Castle from a distance. The fortress was likely the western power centre of Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway.Oram (2000) p. 148. In 1224, the year following the defeat of Rǫgnvaldr's son, the chronicle reveals that Óláfr took hostages from the leading men of the Hebridean portion of the realm, and with a fleet of thirty-two ships, landed on Mann at Ronaldsway, where he confronted Rǫgnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two: with Rǫgnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining a share in the Hebrides.McDonald (2019) pp. 47, 67; Veach (2014) p. 200; Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 189; McDonald (2007a) p. 63; McDonald (2007b) pp. 52–53, 80, 153, 212; Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 126; Duffy (1993) p. 105; Anderson (1922) p. 459; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 88–89. With Óláfr's rise at Rǫgnvaldr expense, the latter turned to Alan,Oram (2011) pp. 189–190; McDonald (2007b) pp. 80–81, 153, 155–156; McNamee (2005); Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 126. one of Scotland's most powerful magnates.Stringer (1998) p. 83. Alan and Rǫgnvaldr were certainly closely connected. Both were great-grandsons of Fergus, Lord of Galloway;McDonald (2007b) p. 154; Stringer (1998) pp. 83, 94. both had received Ulster lands from the English at about the same time; and it is possible that connections between the Isles and Galloway had led to Rǫgnvaldr's involvement with the Scottish Crown in Caithness.McDonald (2007b) p. 155. In a letter from Alan to Henry III, dated the year of the partitioning between the half-brothers, Alan mentioned that he was preoccupied with his army and fleet, travelling from island to island.Oram (2013); Oram (2000) pp. 125–126; Duffy (1993) p. 105; Oram (1988) pp. 136–137; Bain (1881) pp. 158–159 § 890; Sweetman (1875) pp. 185–186 § 1218. This statement may well evince the beginning of the joint military operations, conducted by Alan and Rǫgnvaldr against Óláfr, assigned by the chronicle to the following year.Oram (1988) pp. 136–137; Bain (1881) pp. 158–159 § 890; Sweetman (1875) pp. 185–186 § 1218. According to the latter source, however, the campaigning came to nought because the Manx were unwilling to battle against Óláfr and the Hebrideans.McDonald (2019) pp. 47–48; Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 189; McDonald (2007b) pp. 81, 155; Oram (2000) p. 126; McDonald (1997) p. 86; Duffy (1993) p. 105; Oram (1988) p. 137; Anderson (1922) p. 459; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 88–89. This record appears to show that Alan portrayed his actions in the Isles as related to his conflict with the Lacys in Ireland. As such, the correspondence could be further evidence that the Lacys' Ulster ambitions were aligned with Óláfr in the Isles.Duffy (1993) p. 105. The name of Rǫgnvaldr's rival half-brother, Óláfr, as it appears on folio 163r of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"'\\".Jónsson (1916) p. 556 ch. 168; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). Also in 1224, the thirteenth-century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar reports that Hákon was visited by a certain Gillikristr, Óttar Snækollsson, and many Islesmen, who presented the king with letters concerning certain needs of their lands.Veach (2014) p. 201; Beuermann (2010) p. 111, 111 n. 39; Power (2005) p. 44; McDonald (2004) p. 195; McDonald (1997) pp. 88–89; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 117, 117 n. 142; Gade (1994) pp. 202–203; Cowan (1990) p. 114; Anderson (1922) p. 455; Jónsson (1916) p. 522 ch. 98; Kjær (1910) p. 390 ch. 106/101; Dasent (1894) pp. 89–90 ch. 101; Vigfusson (1887b) p. 87 ch. 101; Unger (1871) p. 440 ch. 105; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 61 ch. 84; Regesta Norvegica (n.d.) vol. 1 p. 168 § 501. One possibility is that these so-called needs refer to the violent kin-strife and recent treaty between the half-brothers.McDonald (1997) p. 89; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 117; Gade (1994) p. 203; Regesta Norvegica (n.d.) vol. 1 p. 168 § 501 n. 1. The saga may therefore reveal that the Norwegian Crown was approached by either representatives of either side of the inter-dynastic conflict, or perhaps by neutral chieftains caught in the middle.Williams, DGE (1997) p. 117; Regesta Norvegica (n.d.) vol. 1 p. 168 § 501 n. 1. Further attempts to quell the infighting by way of the Norwegian Crown may have been undertaken in 1226, when it is remarked by the same source that Simon, Bishop of the Isles met with Hákon.Williams, DGE (1997) p. 117; Anderson (1922) p. 461; Jónsson (1916) p. 546 ch. 147; Kjær (1910) p. 442 ch. 159/147; Dasent (1894) p. 134 ch. 147; Vigfusson (1887b) p. 128 ch. 147; Unger (1871) p. 466 ch. 153; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 89 ch. 121.

A short time later, perhaps in about 1225 or 1226, the chronicle reveals that Rǫgnvaldr oversaw the marriage of a daughter of his to Alan's young illegitimate son, Thomas. Unfortunately for Rǫgnvaldr, this marital alliance appears to have cost him the kingship, since the chronicle records that the Manxmen had him removed from power and replaced with Óláfr.McDonald (2019) pp. 24–25, 46, 48, 62; Oram (2013); Oram (2011) pp. 189–190; McDonald (2007a) pp. 64–65 n. 87; McDonald (2007b) pp. 81, 155, 172; Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 126; Duffy (1993) p. 105; Oram (1988) p. 137; Anderson (1922) pp. 459–460; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 88–91. The recorded resentment of the union could indicate that Alan's son was intended to eventually succeed Rǫgnvaldr,Oram (2013); McDonald (2007b) pp. 155, 157; McNamee (2005); Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) p. 126; Stringer (1998) p. 96; McDonald (1997) p. 92. who was perhaps about sixty years-old at the time, and whose grandchildren were presumably still very young. In fact, it is possible that, in light of Rǫgnvaldr's advanced age and his son's mutilation, a significant number of the Islesmen regarded Óláfr as the rightful heir. Such an observation could well account for the lack of enthusiasm that the Manxmen had for Alan and Rǫgnvaldr's campaign in the Hebrides.Oram (2000) p. 126. Since Thomas was likely little more than a teenager at the time, it may well have been obvious to contemporary observers that Alan was the one who would hold the real power in the kingdom.Oram (2000) pp. 126, 139 n. 107. From the perspective of the Scottish Crown, it is conceivable that Alan's ambitions in the Isles were encouraged by the prospect of Alan's son becoming a dependable client-king on Mann, and the potential to further extend and strengthen Scottish royal authority along the western seaboard, bringing stability to the war-torn region.Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 190; Oram (2004a); Oram (2000) p. 127; Stringer (1998) pp. 96–97. As for Alan—a man who faced the probability that Galloway would be partitioned between his legitimate daughters on his eventual death—the marital alliance may have been conducted as a means to ensure a power base for Thomas, whose illegitimacy threatened to exclude him from inheriting his father's domain under the feudal laws of the English and Scottish realms.Oram (2000) pp. 126–127; Stringer (1998) pp. 96–97. Tynwald Hill, near St John's may have been a national assembly site of the Kingdom of the Isles.Broderick (2003). It may well have been the place where the Islesmen publicly inaugurated their kings,Crawford, BE (2014) pp. 74–75. proclaimed new laws, and resolved disputes.Insley; Wilson (2006). Be that as it may, much of the visible site dates only to the eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth century. Tynwald was the site of the final conflict between Óláfr and Rǫgnvaldr.McDonald (2019) p. 68; Fee (2012) p. 129; McDonald (2007b) p. 82. At this low point of his career, the deposed Rǫgnvaldr appears to have gone into exile at Alan's court in Galloway.McDonald (2019) p. 67; McDonald (2007b) p. 81; Duffy (1993) p. 106. In 1228, whilst Óláfr and his chieftains were absent in Hebrides, the chronicle records of an invasion of Mann by Rǫgnvaldr, Alan, and Thomas fitz Roland. The attack appears to have resulted in the complete devastation of the southern half of the island, since the chronicle declares that it was almost reduced to a desert.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 38; Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 190; McDonald (2007b) pp. 81, 155–156; Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Duffy (2004c); Oram (2004c); Oram (2000) p. 127; Stringer (1998) p. 95; Duffy (1993) p. 106; Oram (1988) p. 137; Anderson (1922) pp. 465–466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 90–91. The chronicle's report that Alan installed bailiffs on Mann, with instructions to collect tribute from the island and send it back to Galloway, may reveal the price Rǫgnvaldr had to pay for Alan's support in the affair. In fact, Rǫgnvaldr's role in the takeover is unrecorded.Oram (2013); McDonald (2007b) pp. 81, 155–156; Anderson (1922) pp. 465–466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 90–91. Suffering serious setbacks at the hands of his enemies, Óláfr reached out for English assistance against his half-brother, as evidenced by correspondence between Henry III and Óláfr in which the latter alluded to aggression dealt from Alan.McDonald (2007b) p. 149; Oram (2000) p. 127; Duffy (1993) p. 105; Oram (1988) p. 137; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) p. 136 § 9; Document 1/16/1 (n.d.). Eventually, after Alan vacated Mann for home, Óláfr and his forces reappeared on the island, and routed the remaining Gallovidians; and thus, the chronicle declares, peace was restored to Mann.Oram (2013) ch. 4; McDonald (2007b) pp. 81, 156; Anderson (1922) pp. 465–466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 90–91. In the same year, English records reveal that Henry III attempted to broker a peace between the half-brothers, and gave Óláfr safe passage to England.Oram (2013); McDonald (2008) p. 148 n. 89; McDonald (2007b) p. 148; McNamee (2005); Bain (1881) p. 182 § 1001; Oliver (1861) p. 69; Rymer; Sanderson; Holmes (1739) pt. 1 p. 104; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 188. This correspondence may have led to Óláfr's temporary absence from Mann that year. It could also roughly mark the point when Rǫgnvaldr finally lost English support.McDonald (2007b) pp. 148–149. Although the English Crown technically recognised Óláfr's kingship in correspondence sent to him the year before, the aggressive tone directed at him suggests that the preferred dynast may well have Rǫgnvaldr at that point in time.McDonald (2008) pp. 148 n. 89; McDonald (2007b) pp. 148, 191, 191 n. 88; Oliver (1861) p. 42; Beck (1844) p. 187; Hardy (1844b) p. 175; Diplomatarium Norvegicum (n.d.) vol. 19 § 185. Final confrontation and death In what was likely early January 1229, the chronicle records that Rǫgnvaldr caught the forces of Óláfr unaware, as Rǫgnvaldr sailed from Galloway with five ships, and launched a nocturnal raid upon the harbour at St Patrick's Isle, near what is today the town of Peel. During this assault, the chronicle records that Rǫgnvaldr had all of the ships of Óláfr and his chieftains destroyed.McDonald (2019) pp. 67–68; Crawford, DKE (2016) p. 105; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 38; Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 190; McDonald (2007a) p. 63; McDonald (2007b) pp. 53, 70, 81; Oram (2000) pp. 127–128; Anderson (1922) p. 466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 90–91. Although the chronicle's description of the attack alludes to Gallovidian involvement, as it states that the expedition originated from Galloway, the fact that Rǫgnvaldr commanded only five ships suggests that this support may have been waning.McDonald (2007b) p. 156; Oram (2000) p. 127. This does not necessary indicate that Alan abandoned Rǫgnvaldr's cause, however, as Alan may well have been engaged in campaigning against the ongoing Meic Uilleim insurrection against the Scottish Crown.Oram (2013); Oram (2011) p. 190. Even if this was the case, Rǫgnvaldr may have also considered Alan's involvement a detriment at this stage. Rǫgnvaldr followed up on his assault by establishing himself in the southern part of Mann, as the chronicle records that he won over the support of the southerners. Meanwhile, Óláfr is stated to have assembled his forces in the north of Mann,McDonald (2019) p. 47; Oram (2013); McDonald (2007b) pp. 81–82, 83; McDonald (1997) p. 86; Anderson (1922) p. 466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 90–93. indicating that the island was divided between the two men for much of January and February, before what would be their final confrontation.McDonald (2007b) p. 83. According to the chronicle, Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr led their armies to Tynwald.McDonald (2019) pp. 24, 68; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Oram (2011) p. 190; McDonald (2007b) pp. 82, 174; Brown, M (2004) p. 78; Oram (2000) pp. 127–128; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 258; Oram (1988) p. 137; Anderson (1922) p. 466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 92–93. The derivation of this place name—from the Old Norse elements ' (\\"assembly\\") and ' (\\"field\\", \\"meadow\\")—reveals that it was an assembly site,McDonald (2007b) p. 82; Broderick (2003). which in turn suggests that negotiations may have been intended. Ruinous St Mary's Abbey, Furness, where Rǫgnvaldr was laid to rest. On 14 February, the festival of St Valentine, the chronicle records that Óláfr's forces launched an attack upon Rǫgnvaldr at Tynwald, where Rǫgnvaldr's troops were routed and he himself was slain. Whilst Rǫgnvaldr's fall is laconically corroborated by the Icelandic annals,McDonald (2007b) p. 29; Storm (1977) pp. 128 § iv, 480 § x; Anderson (1922) p. 467; Vigfusson (1878) p. 371; Flateyjarbok (1868) p. 527. other sources appear to suggest that his death was due to treachery. The fourteenth- century Chronicle of Lanercost, for example, states that Rǫgnvaldr \\"fell a victim to the arms of the wicked\\";McDonald (2019) p. 68; McDonald (2007b) p. 82, 82 n. 72; McLeod (2002) p. 28 n. 12; Anderson (1922) p. 467; Stevenson (1839) p. 40. whilst the Chronicle of Mann states that, although Óláfr grieved at his half-brother's death, he never exacted vengeance upon his killers. The chronicle states that the monks of Rushen took Rǫgnvaldr's body to Furness, where he was buried at the abbey in a place that he had chosen beforehand.McDonald (2007b) pp. 29, 82; Anderson (1922) p. 466; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 92–93. A particular sandstone effigy of an armed, mail-clad warrior, found in the north aisle of the abbey, has been associated with Rǫgnvaldr since the first half of the nineteenth century. Such an association is nevertheless dubious at best.McDonald (2007b) p. 82; McIntire (1943) p. 7; Bower (1899) pp. 432–433, plate xvi fig. 1.

It is based on the television series Alias. The plot was written by Breen Frazier and the game features the voices of the cast principals. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino, and adapted by Chris Tilton. The game was released in 2004, and has a rating of T. The game is set between episodes 19 and 20 of season 2. Plot When CIA agent, Sydney Bristow, is called in to work on her day off, she knows there must be something serious going down. The order came from the CIA's best mind: her father, Jack Bristow. A fellow operative, Agent Jacobs, has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. His last communiqué to the CIA contained highly sensitive intelligence regarding Sydney's nemesis, Anna Espinosa, formerly a top agent for K-Directorate, now gone rogue. While Sydney's been having free time, Anna has been busy - hard at work taking over the \\"Followers of Rambaldi\\" cult, a cabal of zealots hell bent on bringing the visions of 15th century philosopher, physicist and prophet, Milo Rambaldi, to life. Now, Anna has been teaming up with Julian Sark, a slippery and cunning gun-for-hire, along with Sydney's ex-boss, Arvin Sloane, a highly intelligent but utterly corrupt crime lord, and a man Sydney thoroughly despises. Sydney is tasked with finding out what this trio of 'most wanted' fugitives is working on and discover exactly what \\"The Machine\\" is. She is ably assisted by her back-up team; Marcus Dixon, her field partner and loyal friend; Michael Vaughn, her CIA handler; and Marshall Flinkman, a socially inept technological whiz with a gadget for every occasion. Starting in Agent Jacobs' last known location, a casino in Monte Carlo, Sydney locates a data disc in a dead drop. Hacking into a computer in the executive suite, she discovers that the casino's luxurious exterior hides a huge arms manufacturing facility in the basement. Now, Sydney has to acquire a laser prototype being tested there, sneak back into the casino to spy on a meeting between Anna and Sark, and finally escape from the casino grounds with armed enemies in hot pursuit. Jacobs' data leads the team to a museum in Saudi Arabia proudly displaying new artifacts...a mysterious set of bones found in the desert with links to Rambaldi. When Sydney covertly enters the museum to acquire the bones, she finds that Anna has the same idea at the same time, except that Anna has brought her task force. Racing against Anna's forces, Sydney must collect all of the bones before getting a trace on a feeling Anna that takes them to ruins in the desert. Here, Sydney's best efforts are thwarted by Anna's underhanded tactics which force Sydney to put friendship before professional loyalty, and incidentally, disarm a rather large nuclear warhead. While Sydney's been in the desert, Vaughn has tracked both missing agent Jacobs and a mathematician, Dr. Caplan, to an insane asylum in Romania, where prisoners are being held against their will. Breaking into the asylum, Sydney discovers that the prisoners are being used as human guinea pigs for Anna and Sark's experiments with their laser. After freeing Caplan and Jacobs, who in turn free the prisoners, Sydney initiates a daring plan to take Sark into custody and put an end to the experiments by starting a chemical reaction with the laser's components, which destroys the asylum when the reaction goes critical. The horrific truth about the experiments comes out as Caplan is debriefed back at the CIA. Trading his intelligence for immunity, Sark tips the team off that Arvin Sloane is cutting a specific diamond to Anna's very precise specifications in a laboratory beneath an embassy in Hong Kong. Gaining admittance to the embassy by attending a glamorous party in the ballroom, Sydney gets into the cutting room and manages to acquire the diamond. She is forced to trade it for the lives of the innocent partygoers when Sloane appears on the scene and informs Sydney of the C-4 explosives he has placed around the embassy as insurance. Ignoring Sydney's warnings about Anna, he triggers a countdown on the bomb giving Sydney and Dixon just a few minutes to evacuate the embassy and get themselves to safety. Tracing Anna to Rio de Janeiro, Sydney tails her to a nightclub where she is scheduled to meet with Sloan. Bugging a meeting between the two, Sydney finally manages to discover the true, awful potential about \\"The Machine,\\" and its location in an underground bunker in Russia. As Anna marches off a double-crossed Sloane, the CIA operatives receive a surprise visit by the Followers of Rambaldi SWAT team. Realizing there is a mole within the agency, Vaughn attempts to stop the raid only to find that the leaks have come from the most unlikely of sources. The CIA team must regroup to draw up their final make-or-break plans to stop Anna's nefarious plan. Following a HALO parachute jump insertion, Sydney must use all of the skills she has learned to infiltrate the bunker. By stealth, combat and quick-thinking, Sydney gets past Anna's forces and finds a captive Sloane. Reluctantly agreeing to an uneasy truce with him, Sydney must defeat Anna and figure out how to destroy the mighty Machine to stop ecological disaster being launched on the whole planet. As Anna's grand scheme and the bunker begin to collapse around her, Sydney has to push herself to the limit to escape with her life. Alias: Underground Prior to the Acclaim release, ABC Television produced a downloadable episodic video game for PC and Mac entitled Alias: Underground, which was available through ABC's website. Developed by a now-defunct company named Dream Mechanics, the game was a 3D third-person stealth/action game like the Acclaim production, though with comparably lower production values. Each level of the game was produced as an individual episode and released on a monthly basis during the second season between September 2002 and June 2003. Some levels resembled episodes from the TV series (such as \\"Raid on SD-6\\", based on first-season episode \\"The Box\\"), while others were unique creations. For a time, players were eligible to enter a contest based upon their score in the game. Recently, ABC Media announced the ceasing of support for the online game, due to low usage, as the game was easy to complete and new levels were no longer being added. At one time the game was offered free of charge, but now ABC charges US$0.99 for each mission (excluding the training mission, which is still available for free download). Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. References External links * Q & A with J.J.

The company made more than 4000 engines for large machines such as ships, tractors, and busses. The company is notable for its early stationary industrial motors and ship engines, but also for an early 1899 prototype light omnibus called \\"The Brons\\".

It is a 1 cylinder, 4 stroke diesel with spraying cup fuel injection, 1921 Jan Brons (January 20, 1865 - February 9, 1954) first developed an autobus with a motor that ran on petroleum in 1890, but because he wanted it to run on gasoline he then created the omnibus in 1899. It was for this omnibus that he later bought a patent (in Germany, because it was not possible to get a patent for it in the Netherlands). The bus was in service for some years until it broke a wheel. It was never in production. When Rudolf Diesel developed the diesel motor in the 1890s, Brons found it to be too complicated and invented a type of \\"spray cup\\" he called the \\"verstuiverbak\\" or \\"bakjesknapper\\" to simplify the fuel injection process.The Brons Engine on Brons Motor website This method was later bought by HVID, that later patented their method. In the 1930s the company tried to make a comeback with truck engines, full trucks have never been made, though a couple of Brons-tractors were built and sold.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tower is a cast iron plate shell lined with brick and stands high. The adjacent oil house (where fuel was stored in the early days) is made of brick and has also been restored. Fully automated, the beacon is a private aid to navigation. Tours of the tower and oil house are available in summer from the Nauset Light Preservation Society which operates, maintains and interprets the site. History The tower that eventually became Nauset Light was constructed in 1877 as one of two towers in Chatham. It was moved to Eastham in 1923 to replace the Three Sisters of Nauset, three small wood lighthouses that had been decommissioned. They have since been relocated to a small field about west of the Nauset Light. Nauset Light was originally all white, but in the 1940s, the top section of the tower was painted red, creating the iconic appearance. The light was automated and the keeper's house was sold in 1955. The original fourth-order Fresnel lens was removed in 1981 and replaced with aerobeacons. The lens is on display in the Salt Pond Visitor Center of the Cape Cod National Seashore. In December 2008, the old-style bulbs in the aerobeacons were replaced with 400 watt metal halide bulbs. Due to coastal erosion, by the early 1990s Nauset Light was less than from the edge of the cliff on which it stood. In 1993, the Coast Guard proposed decommissioning the light. Following a great public outcry, the non- profit Nauset Light Preservation Society was formed and funded, and in 1995, it leased the lighthouse from the Coast Guard. The Society arranged for both the tower and the brick oil house to be relocated, in November 1996, to a location west of its original position – which by then was only from the cliff's edge. The move was accomplished successfully by International Chimney Corporation, which had moved the larger Highland Light a similar distance earlier that year, with assistance from Expert Movers and a consultant, Pete Friesen. The light was again lit on May 10, 1997. During the ceremony at that time, the Coast Guard transferred ownership of the lighthouse to the National Park Service, but the operation was assumed by the Nauset Light Preservation Society. In 1998, Mary Daubenspeck, who had owned the keeper's house since 1955, agreed to donate it to the National Park Service with the right to live in it for 25 years. It was agreed that the house would be moved from its original location, then only from the edge of the cliff, to a new location near the relocated tower. The move was completed in October 1998 by Gary Sylvester's Building Movers & Excavators. =Lighthouse keepers= The following individuals were keepers of this light after the tower was moved to Eastham from the Chatham Light in 1923. *George I.

Brought up in the Roman Catholic tradition, he joined the Orthodox Church in 1928 and worked for the union of the churches. Life Louis Gillet was born on 8 August 1892 or 1893 in Saint-Marcellin, Isère, France. He studied in Grenoble and philosophy in Paris. During World War I he was mobilised and posted to the front, where he made liaison with British troops. He was taken prisoner in 1914 and spent three years in captivity with British and Russian prisoners, when he was attracted by the spirit and the spirituality of the Orthodox Russian prisoners. After the war he studied mathematics and psychology in Geneva, but he decided to join the Benedictines of Clairvaux in 1919. At this period he spent some time in the Benedictine house at Farnborough in Britain, and studying theology in Rome. Attracted by Eastern Christianity, he became acquainted with Dom Lambert Baudouin (who later founded the bi-ritual communities at Amay and Chevetogne) and Metropolitan bishop Andriy Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Galicia and pronounced his final vows as Lev in 1925 at the Studite monastery of Univ Lavra in Galicia. Disappointed by the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church towards Orthodoxy, Gillet was received into the Orthodox Church in Paris in May 1928 by Metropolitan Evlogii - with the approval, Fr Lev always maintained, of Metropolitan Andriy. In November 1928, he became rector of the parish of Sainte-Geneviève-de-Paris, the first French-speaking Orthodox parish. In 1938 he left Paris to settle in London, within the framework of the Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius, an ecumenical organization dedicated to the bringing together of the Anglican and Orthodox churches. At first he worked in various capacities - as warden of a boys' hostel, as a lecturer in the Quaker college in Birmingham, and serving the Society of Christians and Jews. In 1947 he was invited by the Orthodox Youth Movement in Lebanon to become their chaplain there, and travelled to Lebanon at the beginning of 1948; but illness forced him to return to Britain later that year. He became a chaplain to the Fellowship in 1948 and resident at its headquarters in St Basil's House. He worked part-time for the Spalding Trust and the Movement for the Great Religions of the World. He remained in Britain until his death in 1980, going on many journeys abroad, in particular to France, Switzerland and Lebanon, where he took part in the spiritual revival of Antiochian Orthodoxy. Principal publications in French (under the pseudonym \\"A Monk of the Eastern Church\\") include The Jesus Prayer, Introduction to Orthodox Spirituality, The year of grace of the Lord: A commentary on the Byzantine liturgical year and Jesus, simple gazes to the Saviour. Quotation :O strange Orthodox Church, so poor and weak, with neither the organization nor the culture of the West, staying afloat as if by a miracle in the face of so many trials, tribulations and struggles; a Church of contrasts, both so traditional and so free, so archaic and so alive, so ritualist and so personally involved, a Church where the priceless pearl of the Gospel is assiduously preserved, sometimes under a layer of dust; a Church which in shadows and silence maintains above all the eternal values of purity, poverty, asceticism, humility and forgiveness; a Church which has often not known how to act, but which can sing of the joy of Pascha like no other.{'La Quête de Vérité d'Irénée Winnaert' by Vincent Bourne - Geneva: Labor et Fides, 1966. p.335. partly quoted on p.24 of 'The Inner Kingdom' by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware - St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2001 } Works * Gillet, Lev (1942), Communion in the Messiah: Studies in the Relationship between Judaism and Christianity, Lutterworth Press, republished by James Clarke (2002), * * Gillet, Lev (1988), 'Encounter at the Well', Mowbray. * Gillet, Lev (1977), 'In Thy Presence', St Vladimir's Seminary Press.

Guðrøðr Magnússon (fl. 1275),McDonald (2007). also known as Godred Magnusson,Moore, D (2013); Oram (2000). was an illegitimate son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles. In 1275, whilst Mann was under Scottish overlordship, Guðrøðr led an unsuccessful revolt on the island. According to a near contemporary source, over five hundred people lost their lives in the subsequent Scottish invasion and suppression of the Manx. It is not certain whether Guðrøðr escaped the decisive defeat of the rebels at Battle of Ronaldsway with his life or if he was among the slain. Background Guðrøðr was a son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles,McDonald (2019) p. p. ix tab. 1; McDonald (2007) p. 27 tab. 1; Sellar (2000) p. 192 tab. i. a member of the Crovan dynasty.McDonald (2007) p. 27 tab. 1. Guðrøðr's father came to power in 1252, following a period of confusion and contention in the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, when Magnús' right to rule was acknowledged by Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, his nominal overlord.McDonald (2007) p. 89. In the previous decade, Alexander II, King of Scotland had made several attempts to incorporate the Hebrides into the Scottish realm. In the 1260s, Alexander's son and successor, Alexander III, King of Scotland, renewed his kingdom's struggle to wrest the region from Norwegian overlordship. In so doing, Alexander III provoked a retaliatory military response from Hákon, a campaign that ultimately ended in failure with the latter's weakening health and death in 1263.Wærdahl (2011) pp. 49–50. With Hákon's passing Alexander III seized the initiative, and oversaw a series of invasions into the Isles and northern Scotland. Recognising this dramatic shift in royal authority, Magnús Óláfsson submitted to Alexander III within the year,Neville; Simpson (2012) p. 212 § 231; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 261–262; McDonald (1997) pp. 53, 115–116; Taylor; Watt; Scott (1990) pp. 348–349; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) pp. 213–214; Anderson (1922) p. 653 n. 2; Skene (1872) pp. 295–296 ch. 56; Skene (1872) pp. 300–301 ch. 56; Goodall (1759) pp. 101–102 bk. 10 ch. 18; Hearnius (1722a) p. 770. and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles.Brown (2004) p. 84. The following year, Magnús died without a legitimate heir to succeed him, and proved to be the last ruling king of the Crovan dynasty.McDonald (2007) pp. 92, 101, 222. In 1266, Alexander III pacifically secured the Hebrides and Mann from Hákon's son and successor, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway, by way of the Treaty of Perth.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 262–263; McDonald (1997) pp. 120–123, 136–137. Following the conclusion of the treaty, Alexander III entrusted control of Mann into the hands of royal officials. Four such bailiffs or justiciars are known to have been appointed to govern the island: a certain \\"\\"; Alan, illegitimate son of Thomas fitz Roland, Earl of Atholl; a certain \\"\\" / \\"\\"; and Reginald, the king's chaplain.McDonald (2019) pp. 37, 41 n. 33; Neville (2015) p. 160; Neville; Simpson (2012) pp. 199–200 §§ 170–173 213 §§ 241–244, 214 § 246; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duncan (1996) p. 582; Barrow (1981) p. 119; Anderson (1922) p. 657; Wilson, J (1915) pp. 488–490 § 497; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 231–232; Stevenson (1839) p. 64. It is evident that Scottish rule was resented by the Manx,McDonald (2019) p. 37. and Scottish exchequer records reveal that the Scottish Crown held several Manx hostages as a means to ensure order on the island.McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duncan; Brown (1956–1957) p. 214. Rise and fall If the hostages were still held by the Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their lives.McDonald (1997) p. 137.

According to the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process.McDonald (1997) p. 137; Anderson (1908) p. 382; Howlett (1885) p. 570. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci, John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch, Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll, and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí.Pollock (2015) pp. 192–193, 193 n. 189; Young (2008); Tout; Ridgeway (2005); Brown (2004) p. 85; McDonald (2004) pp. 180–181, 183; Sellar (2004); Barrow (2003) pp. 86, 348; Carpenter (2004) pp. 389–390; Oram (2000) p. 156; Sellar (2000) p. 210; Stringer, K (1995) p. 88. The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the common army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.Duncan (1996) p. 582. The Scots made landfall on the southern shores of Mann.Duncan (1996) p. 582; Anderson (1922) p. 672; Maxwell (1913) p. 11; Stevenson (1839) pp. 97–98. According to the Chronicle of Lanercost, the invaders first attempted to resolve the uprising peaceably, demanding that the rebels stand down and submit to Alexander III.McDonald (2019) p. 36; Neville (2012) p. 14; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Anderson (1922) pp. 672–673; Maxwell (1913) p. 11; Stevenson (1839) pp. 97–98; Munch; Goss (1874) p. 232. The account preserved by the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum suggests that lightly armed and poorly trained rebels were soundly crushed by well- armed Scottish warriors,McDonald (1997) p. 137; Anderson (1908) p. 383; Howlett (1885) p. 570. with the Annals of Lanerost declaring that \\"the wretched Manxmen turned their backs, and perished miserably\\".McDonald (2019) p. 36; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Anderson (1922) pp. 672–673; Maxwell (1913) p. 11; Stevenson (1839) p. 98. Although the Chronicle of Mann specifies that five hundred thirty seven people were slaughtered by the Scots,McDonald (2019) p. 36; Carpenter (2004) p. 389; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duffy (1993) p. 163; Anderson (1922) p. 673 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 110–111. there is reason to suspect that this tally may owe itself to contemporary poetic convention, as the source further quotes the following rhyming lament: \\"ten times fifty, three times ten and five and two did fall; O Manx race, beware lest future catastrophe you befall\\".McDonald (2019) p. 36; Moore, DW (2005) pp. 93, 104; Anderson (1922) p. 673 n. 1; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 110–111. It is unknown if the passage was composed directly for the chronicle or else already in circulation. In any case, the prophetic nature of the piece appears to be indicative of a Manx provenance.McDonald (2019) p. 36. It is uncertain if Guðrøðr died in the defeatSellar (2000) p. 210; Sellar (1997–1998). or escaped escaped with his life.Carpenter (2004) p. 389. The continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum certainly reports that he and his wife managed to escape the carnage on Mann, and fled to Wales.McDonald (2019) p. 37; McDonald (2007) p. 107; Duffy (1993) p. 163; Anderson (1908) p. 383; Howlett (1885) p. 570. If correct, this source is one of several that demonstrate strong connections between the Crovan dynasty and Wales spanning the eleventh- and thirteenth centuries.Moore, D (2013) ch. 3; McDonald (2007) pp. 105–107; Moore, D (1996) p. 27. In fact, it is possible that Guðrøðr initiated his rebellion having arrived from Wales. Aftermath Upon the successful subjugation of the Manx, Alexander III evidently installed his son, Alexander, as Lord of Mann.McDonald (2019) p. 37; Neville (2015) p. 160; Neville (2012) p. 13; Neville; Simpson (2012) pp. 198–199 § 171; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duffy (1993) p. 163. Although this eleven year-old child was too young to govern in person, his elevation to the lordship reinforced Scottish control of the island in dramatic fashion. The bestowal of Mann as a royal appanage openly designated the prince as the heir to the Scottish throne, and enabled the authority of the Scottish Crown to be personally represented on the island.McDonald (2019) p. 37; Neville (2015) pp. 160–161. Evidence of trouble faced by the Scots on Mann occurs in 1288, when the Sheriff of Dumfries rendered an account for the expense of guarding the lands of a person slain on the island in the service of the Scottish Crown.Duffy (1993) pp. 163–164. As it turned out, Scottish control was not long-lasting, and before end of the century the Manx placed themselves under the overlordship of the English Crown.Brown (2004) p. 164; Duffy (1993) p. 164; Freke (1990) p. 115. Furthermore, Guðrøðr was not the last claimant to the island, as two women are known to have put forth claims of their own in the late thirteenth- and early fourteenth centuries: a certain Aufrica de Connoght, and Maria, daughter of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles.Sellar (1997–1998); Wagner (1960) p. 72.

The game was later ported to Linux by Hyperion Entertainment and published by Linux Game Publishing in 2006. The AmigaOS 4 version was released in 2015.  Gameplay  The game features two modes: In the real-time 'exploration' mode, the player controls game characters using a mouse in a point-and-click manner to navigate the player characters through the city as well as interacting with various objects in the game world. Combat takes place in preset encounters located in specific areas of each level map. In the combat mode, the screen is divided into squares with player and computer-controlled characters taking turns trying to eliminate the opposing party. In one turn each game character can move by a certain number of squares and use a weapon once, or decide to take cover instead. Weapons have different tactical effects, for example the pistol can only be fired orthogonally, while the rifle can be fired orthogonally and diagonally. The game ends if any player-controlled character dies.  Plot  The player commands a small group of NATO operatives who must reveal the mystery behind the sudden appearance of hybrid creatures in a former Soviet military base at a small Polish town near Lubin. The area is surrounded by NATO troops and media from all over the world, and the first group sent into town disappears without a trace. The main hero of the story is the 40-year-old Canadian soldier Cole Sullivan, a commando team member with extensive scientific knowledge. His team's task is to explain the hybrids' presence and to find the missing members of Group One.  Development and release  Work on the game began at least as early as 1997, at which time it was known only by the working title \\"Haunted City\\" (which Adrian Chmielarz of Metropolis Software clarified has almost nothing to do with the game and \\"just somehow stuck\\"). The game was rendered entirely using Real3D. The developers debated over whether combat in the game should be realtime, turn-based, or a combination of both. Hyperion Entertainment also announced an AmigaOS 4 version of the game, but nothing was heard of the port since then. At the Amiga30th Anniversary Dinner in 2015 the AmigaOS version was finally demonstrated in a near finished state with an estimated release of Christmas 2015. Reception Eric Bratcher reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A groundbreaking title kept from four-star status only by the at-times unwieldy mechanics and some minimal balance issues. Try this.\\" IGN rated the Windows version of Gorky 17 as \\"decent\\", highlighting the mix of turn-based strategy, adventure and RPG genres. Graphically, \\"the environments themselves are nicely drawn, character animations are very fluid, and the atmosphere presented is ultimately quite captivating.\\" Criticisms included the lack of a line-of-sight mechanic and some interface flaws.  Sequels  Gorky Zero: Beyond Honor is a third-person isometric stealth action game. The story serves as a prequel to Gorky 17. The game was published in North America and the United Kingdom by JoWooD Entertainment. Gorky Zero 2: Aurora Watching is a third-person stealth action game, and a sequel to Gorky Zero. The game was published in North America by Dreamcatcher Interactive as Soldier Elite, and in Europe by Enlight Software as Aurora Watching. The English translation ignores all ties to the previous Gorky titles, for example changing the protagonist's name from Cole Sullivan to White Fox. The English language story concerns the protagonist infiltrating a secret Russian base where scientists are developing enhanced human soldiers called \\"Crazy Ivans\\".

He was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, and a member of the Crovan dynasty. Magnús' realm encompassed Mann and parts of the Hebrides. Some leading members of Magnús' family—such as his father—styled themselves \\"King of the Isles\\"; other members—such as Magnús and his brothers—styled themselves \\"King of Mann and the Isles\\". Although kings in their own right, leading members of the Crovan dynasty paid tribute to the Kings of Norway and generally recognised a nominal Norwegian overlordship of Mann and the Hebrides. In 1237, Óláfr died and was succeeded by his elder son, Haraldr, who later drowned in 1248. The kingship was then taken up by his brother, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson. After a reign of only weeks, Rǫgnvaldr was slain and the kingship was taken up by Haraldr Guðrøðarson, a descendant of Óláfr's half- brother and deadly rival, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. After a short reign, this Haraldr was removed from power by his overlord, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. In Haraldr's absence, Magnús and a relation of his, Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, King in the Isles, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Mann. A few years later, Magnús successfully made his return to the island and was proclaimed king. In the 1240s, following attempts to purchase the Isles from Hákon, Alexander II, King of Scots resorted to warfare to win the region. His death in 1249 brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, and it was not until the 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles. In 1261, Alexander II's son and successor, Alexander III, attempted to purchase the Isles without success, before Scottish forces raided into the Hebrides. Hákon's response to Scottish aggression was to organise a massive fleet to re-assert Norwegian authority. In the summer of 1263, the fleet sailed down through the Hebrides. Although his forces gained strength as they sailed southwards, the Norwegian king received only lukewarm support from many of his Norse-Gaelic vassals—in fact, Magnús was one of the few who came out whole-heartedly for Hákon. At one point during the campaign, Hákon sent Magnús and some other vassals raiding deep into Lennox. Meanwhile, the main Norwegian force was occupied with the Battle of Largs—a famous, but inconclusive series of skirmishes against the Scots. Following this action, Hákon's demoralised fleet returned home having accomplished little. Not long after Hákon's departure and death, Alexander launched a punitive expedition into the Hebrides, and threatened Mann with the same. Magnús' subsequent submission to the Scottish king, and the homage rendered for his lands, symbolises the failure of Hákon's campaign, and marks the complete collapse of Norwegian influence in the Isles. Magnús, the last reigning king of his dynasty, died at Castle Rushen in 1265, and was buried at the Abbey of St Mary of Rushen. At the time of his death, he was married to Eóghan's daughter Máire. In the year after his death, the Hebrides and Mann were formally ceded by King of Norway to the King of Scots. Ten years after Magnús' death, Guðrøðr, a bastard son of his attempted to establish himself as king on Mann. Guðrøðr's revolt was quickly and brutally crushed by Scottish forces, and the island remained part of the Kingdom of Scotland. By the 1290s, the Hebridean portion of Magnús' former island-kingdom had been incorporated into a newly created Scottish sheriffdom. Background Map of the Kingdom of the Isles circa 1200.McDonald 2007: p. 25. The lands of the Crovan dynasty bordering those of Clann Somhairle. Magnús was a member of the Crovan dynasty—a line of Norse-Gaelic sea-kings whose kingdom encompassed the Isle of Man (Mann) and the northern parts of the Hebrides, from the late eleventh century to the mid thirteenth century. Although the kingdom originally encompassed the entirety of the Hebrides, much of the Inner Hebrides was permanently lost in the mid twelfth century, but the dynasty retained control of the largest Hebridean islands of Lewis and Harris and Skye. Magnús was the son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1237). Although Óláfr is known to have had two wives, and no contemporaneous source names the mother of his children, Magnús' mother may have been Óláfr's second wife—Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar, Earl of Ross, (died c.1251).McDonald 2007: p. 79 fn 48. Óláfr was a younger son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1187). Before his death in 1187, Guðrøðr instructed that Óláfr should succeed to the kingship. However, Guðrøðr was instead succeeded by his elder son, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1229), who had popular support.McDonald 2007: pp. 70–71. Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr, who are thought to have had different mothers, subsequently warred over the dynasty's kingdom in the early thirteenth century, until Rǫgnvaldr was slain battling Óláfr in 1229.Duffy 2004c. See also: McNamee 2004. Rǫgnvaldr's son, Guðrøðr (died 1231), who was also in conflict with Óláfr, took up his father's claim to the throne, and at his height co-ruled the kingdom with Óláfr in 1231. Guðrøðr was slain in 1231, and Óláfr ruled the entire kingdom without internal opposition until his own death in 1237.McNamee 2004. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr, who later travelled to Norway and married a daughter of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), but lost his life at sea on his return voyage in 1248. In May 1249, Haraldr's brother, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1249), formally succeeded to the kingship of the Crovan dynasty's kingdom.McDonald 2007: pp. 87–88, 151–152. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's reign was an extremely short one; only weeks after his accession, he was slain on Mann. His killer is identified by a contemporary source as a knight named Ívarr who may have been an ally of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's second cousin once removed, Haraldr Guðrøðarson (fl. 1249), who seized the kingship immediately following the killing.McDonald 2007: p. 88. Although at first Haraldr was recognised as a legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England (died 1272),Anderson 1922: p. 567 fn 2. Haraldr was later regarded as a usurper by his Norwegian overlord, Hákon. In 1250, Hákon summoned Haraldr to Norway to answer for his seizure of the kingship, and Haraldr was kept from returning to the Isles.McDonald 2007: pp. 88–89. Eóghan of Argyll and the invasion of Mann Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died c.1268×1275) was a prominent member of Clann Somhairle, the descendants of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde, King of the Isles (died 1164).Sellar 2004b. Through Somhairle's wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1153), several leading members of Clann Somhairle claimed kingship in the Hebrides.Beuermann 2010: p. 102. In 1248, Eóghan and his second cousin, Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí (died 1268), travelled to Hákon in Norway and requested the title of king in the Hebrides. Hákon subsequently bestowed the title upon Eóghan, and the following year, upon learning of Haraldr Óláfsson's death, Hákon sent Eóghan westward to take control of the Isles (at least temporarily) on his behalf.Beuermann 2010: p. 108. See also: Sellar 2004b. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 554–555. Up until this point Eóghan had two overlords: the King of Norway, who claimed the Hebrides; and the King of Scots, who claimed Argyll and coveted the Hebrides. Unfortunately for Eóghan, soon after his return from Norway, Alexander II, King of Scots (died 1249) led an expedition deep into Argyll and demanded that Eóghan renounce his allegiance to Hákon. Eóghan refused to do so and was subsequently driven from his Scottish lordship.Sellar 2004b. See also: Stringer 2004. In 1250, following Haraldr Guðrøðarson's summons to Norway, the Chronicle of Mann records that Magnús and Eóghan arrived on Mann with a force of Norwegians. The exact intentions of the invaders are unknown; it is possible that they may have intended to install Magnús as king.McDonald 2007: p. 89. At the very least, Eóghan was likely looking for some form of compensation for his dispossession from his mainland Scottish lordship.Sellar 2004b. See also: Stringer 2004. See also: Brown 2004: p. 81. See also: McDonald 1997: p. 104. The chronicle states that the invaders made landfall at Ronaldsway, and entered into negotiations with the Manx people; although, when it was learned that Eóghan styled himself \\"King of the Isles\\", the Manxmen took offence and broke off all dialogue.McDonald 1997: p. 104. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 567–569. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 104–109. The chronicle indicates that Eóghan had his men form-up on St Michael's Isle, an island that was attached to Mann by a tidal causeway. As evening drew near, the chronicle records that an accomplice of the knight Ívarr led a Manx assault on the island and routed the invading forces. The next day, the chronicle states that the invading forces left the shores of Mann.McDonald 2007: p. 89. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 567–569. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 104–109. Ívarr's connection to the Manx attack on the invading forces of Eóghan and Magnús suggests that there was still considerable opposition on Mann by adherents of Haraldr to the prospect of Magnús' kingship there.McDonald 2007: p. 89. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: p. 206 fn 49. The following year, Henry III commanded the Justiciar of Ireland, John fitz Geoffrey (died 1258), to prohibit Magnús from raising military forces in Ireland for an invasion of Mann.Duffy 2007: p. 21. See also: McDonald 2007: p. 89. See also: Close rolls of the reign of Henry III. Preserved in the Public Record Office 1970: p. 177. See also: Sweetman 1875: p. 478 (#3206). See also: Cooper 1832: pp. 425–426. A year later Magnús succeeded to the kingship, as the chronicle records that he returned to Mann and, with the consent of the people, began his reign.McDonald 2007: p. 89. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 573, See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 108–109. There are indications that opposition to Magnús, and thus possibly support of Haraldr, continued into the mid 1250s.McDonald 2007: pp. 89–90. For example, the chronicle records that when Hákon bestowed upon Magnús the title of king in 1254, it further notes that when Magnús' opponents heard of this, they became dismayed and that their hopes of overthrowing him gradually faded away.McDonald 2007: pp. 89–90. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 578. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 108–109. Furthermore, a letter of protection, written on behalf of Henry to Magnús in 1256, orders Henry's men not to receive Haraldr and Ívarr, which may thus indicate that these two men were still alive and active. Although Magnús' eldest brother, Haraldr Óláfsson, appears to have ruled over the entirety of the dynasty's thirteenth-century sea-realm, as did Magnús from 1252 onwards, the situation during the years between Haraldr Óláfsson's death and Magnús' accession is uncertain, and it is possible that the kingdom was partitioned between feuding dynasts, as it had been during the bitter inter-dynastic strife of the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries.McDonald 2007: p. 92. Clearly the situation in the Isles was unsettled in the 1250s. For example, Henry is known to have written letters to Alexander, Hákon, and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (died 1282), the co-ruler of Gwynedd, ordering them not allow their men invade Mann in Magnús' absence there in 1254.McDonald 1997: p. 104 fn 4. Scottish aggression Castle Rushen, where Magnús died in 1265. By the mid thirteenth century the castle had become the power-centre on Mann. The castle dates to the late twelfth- or early thirteenth century.McDonald 2007: pp. 40, 84, 210. In 1244, Alexander made the first of several attempts by Scottish monarchs to purchase the Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, and it was not until the 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.Stringer 2004. In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an emissary to Norway to discuss the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, in response to the failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous.Munro; Munro 2004. See also: Reid 2004. See also: McDonald 1997: pp. 106–107. See also: Cowan 1990: pp. 117–118. See also: Duncan; Brown 1956–1957: p. 212. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was at the height of his power, and his only son had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.Power 2005: pp. 50–53. Norwegian retaliation The Norwegian-led expedition along the south-western seaboard of Scotland. Late in the summer of 1263, Hákon's fleet reached the northern seaboard of Scotland. Although the precise size of the fleet is unknown, the Icelandic Annals remark that \\"so great a host that an equally great army is not known ever to have gone from Norway\\".McDonald 1997: p. 107. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 607. Upon reaching the Scottish- mainland, the late thirteenth century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar (\\"The Saga of Hákon Hákonarson\\"),Clunies Ross 2010: pp. 59, 91–92. See also: Cowan 1990: pp. 103–106. states that Hákon levied a tax upon Caithness and considered plundering into the Moray Firth. It is possible that he intended these acts as a form of retribution for the Earl of Ross' savage attack on Skye.McDonald 1997: p. 108. The fleet then made its way south along the western seaboard to Skye, where the saga records that Hákon was met by Magnús.McDonald 1997: p. 108. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 615–616. The saga states that Hákon's fleet then sailed south to Kerrera, where Dubhghall and Magnús amongst others, were sent to lead fifty ships towards Kintyre, while a smaller group was sent to Bute.McDonald 1997: p. 109. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 617. The fleet sent to Kintyre was likely tasked with obtaining the allegiance of Aonghus Mór mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay (died c.1293) and a certain Murchadh,McDonald 1997: p. 109. both who are stated by the saga to have afterwards submitted to Hákon.McDonald 1997: p. 109. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 618. The saga records that several castles were secured by Hákon's forces: Rothesay Castle on Bute; and an unnamed castle in southern Kintyre,McDonald 1997: p. 110. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 619–620. which was more than likely Dunaverty Castle.McDonald 1997: p. 110. At Gigha, the saga relates that Eóghan surrendered himself to Hákon, and informed the Norwegian king that he had decided to side with the Scots from whom he held a larger grant of lands.McDonald 1997: pp. 111–112. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 617. At about the time when Hákon let Eóghan go free, the saga records that the first messengers from the King of Scots arrived to parley.McDonald 1997: pp. 111–112.

He sent a detachment of ships deep into Lennox, through Loch Long—different versions of the saga number the force at forty and sixty ships—led by Magnús, Dubhghall, (Dubhghall's brother) Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí, Aonghus Mór, and Murchad. The saga states that the ships were dragged across land to Loch LomondMcDonald 1997: p. 112. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 625–626, 625 fn 7.—which indicates that the invaders would have beached their ships and made portage across the isthmus between the two lochs (between what are today the settlements of Arrochar and Tarbet).Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 258. See also: Barrow 1981: p. 117. The saga vividly describes how the invaders wasted the well-inhabited islands of the loch and the dwellings surrounding the loch.McDonald 1997: p. 112. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 625–626. The fact that Hákon tasked his Norse-Gaelic magnates with leading this foray likely indicates that their boats were lighter than those of the Norwegians, and thus easier to portage from one loch to another; it could also indicate that the undertaking was meant to test their faithfulness to the Norwegian cause.McDonald 1997: p. 112.

Hákon and his main force, stationed between the Cumbraes and the Scottish mainland,Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 258–260. were occupied with the events surrounding the Battle of Largs, between 30 September and 3 October.McDonald 1997: pp. 113–114. Although claimed by later Scottish chroniclers as a great victory, in reality the so- called battle was nothing more than \\"a series of disorderly skirmishes\\", with relatively few casualties that achieved little for either side. Following the encounter, Hákon led his fleet northward up through the Hebrides. At Mull, he parted with his Norse-Gaelic lords: Dubhghall was rewarded with Eóghan's former island-domain; Murchad was given Arran, and a certain Ruaidrí was given Bute.McDonald 1997: p. 114. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 634–635. The Norwegian fleet left the Hebrides and reached Orkney by the end of October, where an ill Hákon died in mid December. Despite the saga's claim that Hákon had been triumphant,Anderson 1922: p. 635. in reality the campaign was a failure. Alexander's kingdom had successfully defended itself from Norwegian might, and many of Hákon's Norse-Gaelic supporters had been reluctant to support his cause.Barrow 1981: pp. 118–119. Hebridean-Manx subjugation Within months of Hákon's abortive campaign, embassies were sent forth from Norway to discuss terms of peace. Meanwhile, Alexander seized the initiative and made ready to punish the magnates who had supported Hákon. In 1264, Alexander assembled a fleet and made ready to invade Mann. Without any protection from his Norwegian overlord,McDonald 2007: pp. 53, 207, 222. See also: Brown 2004: pp. 83–85. See also: McDonald 1997: p. 115.

The two monarchs met at Dumfries, where Magnús swore oaths to Alexander, rendered homage, and surrendered hostages. In return for Alexander's promise of protection against Norwegian retribution, Magnús was forced to provide Alexander's navy with several \\"pirate type galleys\\"—five of twenty oars and five of twelve oars. Alexander then ordered an invasion of the Western Isles, led by Uilleam, Earl of Mar (died ×1281), Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan (died 1289), and Alan Durward (died 1275).Paton; Reid 2004.

The submission forced upon the island-magnates, particularly that of Magnús, marked the complete collapse of Norwegian influence in the Isles.Brown 2004: p. 84. Acta and honours Magnús' surviving 1256 charter. Only twenty originals, copies, or abstract versions of royal charters of the kings of the Crovan dynasty are known. Of these, only three date to the reign of Magnús—one of which, a grant to Conishead Priory in 1256, is the only original royal charter of the dynasty in existence.McDonald 2007: p. 202. Important devices attached to royal charters were double-sided waxen seals, used to authenticate such instruments. Although no seals of the dynasty now survive, there exists several seventeenth- and eighteenth-century descriptions and depictions of ones believed to have belonged to Magnús' uncle Rǫgnvaldr, and brother Haraldr. This limited evidence suggests that, in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries, the kings of the dynasty bore a sailing ship upon their seals, which would have likely represented the clinker-built galley utilised in the Isles at the time.McDonald 2007: pp. 204–206. Borne by men whose strength lay in the power of armed galley-fleets, such a symbol would have represented their authority in the Isles.McDonald 2007: p. 206. See also: McDonald 1995: p. 143.

See also: McDonald 2007: pp. 37–38, 99–100. Analysis of the document reveals that the main scribe's last entry dates to 1257, in an account which records the dedication of the Abbey of St Mary of Rushen in the presence of Magnús and Richard, Bishop of the Isles. The chronicle thus appears to have been commissioned by, or on behalf of, Magnús himself.McDonald 2007: pp. 76, 99–100. The chronicle is somewhat biased in favour of one line of the dynasty over another—the line of Magnús's father, Óláfr, over that of Óláfr's rival half-brother Rǫgnvaldr. For example, Haraldr Guðrøðarson is depicted as a usurper and tyrant, in contrast to the legitimate kingship of his cousin, Magnús. In fact, one reason for the chronicle's composition may have been to legitimise the line of Óláfr which, at the time of the chronicle's compilation, was then represented by Magnús himself. Like his father and his brother Haraldr, Magnús is recorded within the Chronicle of Mann as having been knighted by Henry III.McDonald 2007: p. 215. See also: McDonald 2005: p. 193 fn 50. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 587, 587 fn 1. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 108–109. The knighthoods of Haraldr (in 1247) and Magnús (in 1256) appear to be confirmed by independent English sources. For example, within Henry's letter to Magnús in 1256, Magnús is described to have been invested with a military belt by the English king.McDonald 2005: p. 193 fn 50. See also: Oliver 1861: p. 86.

See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 653, 653 fn 1. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 94–95.

See also: Kermode 2005: p. 6. See also: Kermode; Herdman 1904: p. 86. At the time of his death,Munch; Goss 1874: p. 206. Magnús is known to have been married to Eóghan's daughter, Máire (died 1302). As the last of a long line of Norse-Gaelic rulers of Mann, his death ended the island's so-called \\"golden-age\\" of Scandinavian sea-kings.McDonald 2007: p. 100. The continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum records simply, that on his death, \\"kings ceased to reign on Mann\\".McDonald 2007: p. 90. See also: Howlett 1895: p. 549. Dismantled kingdom Three years after the inconclusive skirmish at Largs, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. On 2 July 1266, with the conclusion of the Treaty of Perth, the centuries-old territorial dispute over Scotland's western seaboard was at last settled.McDonald 1997: pp. 119–121. Within the treaty, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1280) ceded the Hebrides and Mann to Alexander, who in turn agreed to pay 4,000 merks sterling over four years, and in addition to pay 100 merks sterling in perpetuity. Other conditions stipulated that the inhabitants of the islands would be subject to laws of Scotland; that they were not to be punished for their actions previous to the treaty; and that they were free to remain or leave their possessions peacefully.Lustig 1979: pp. 44–45. In 1266, the Chronicle of Lanercost records that Alexander ruled Mann through appointed bailiffs; Scottish exchequer accounts record that the Sheriff of Dumfries was given allowance for maintaining seven Manx hostages.Duncan; Brown 1956–1957: p. 214. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 657. In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led a revolt on Mann and attempted to establish himself as king.McDonald 2007: pp. 54. See also: Sellar 2000: p. 210. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and early the next morning the revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway.McDonald 2007: pp. 54. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 672–673. See also: Munch; Goss 1874: pp. 110–111. Guðrøðr may very well have been slain in the defeat,Sellar 2000: p. 210. although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.McDonald 2007: p. 107. See also: Anderson 1908: pp. 382–383. See also: Howlett 1895: p. 570. By the end of the thirteenth century, the islands once ruled by Magnús and his fellow members of the Crovan dynasty before him, were incorporated into the Scottish realm. In 1293, the parliament of John, King of Scots (died 1314) established three new sheriffdoms within his kingdom. One of these three, the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have been taken over earlier, sometime after the dismantling of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.Brown 2004: p. 85. See also: Munro; Munro 2004.

Bone morphogenetic proteins are known for their ability to induce the growth of bone and cartilage. BMP6 is able to induce all osteogenic markers in mesenchymal stem cells. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. BMPs are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily. BMPs were originally identified by an ability of demineralized bone extract to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site.

The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (Pali; Sanskrit: Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra; English: The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of the Dharma Sutta or Promulgation of the Law Sutta) is a Buddhist text that is considered by Buddhists to be a record of the first sermon given by Gautama Buddha. The main topic of this sutta is the Four Noble Truths, which refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism in a formulaic expression. This sutta also refers to the Buddhist concepts of the Middle Way, impermanence, and dependent origination. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha delivered this discourse on the day of Asalha Puja, in the month of Ashadha, in a deer sanctuary in Isipatana. This was seven weeks after he attained enlightenment. His audience consisted of five ascetics who had been his former companions: Kondañña, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa, and Mahānāma.  Definitions  Dhamma (Pāli) or dharma (Sanskrit) can mean a variety of things depending on its context; in this context, it refers to the Buddha's teachings or his \\"truth\\" that leads to one's liberation from suffering. Cakka (Pāli) or cakra (Sanskrit) can be translated as \\"wheel.\\" The dhammacakka, which can be translated as \\"Dhamma-Wheel,\\" is a Buddhist symbol referring to Buddha's teaching of the path to enlightenment. Pavattana (Pāli) can be translated as \\"turning\\" or \\"rolling\\" or \\"setting in motion.\\" Text The sutra contains the following topics:accesstoinsight, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu] * The two extremes to be avoided (sensual indulgence and self-mortification) * The Middle Way * The Four Noble Truths * The Noble Eightfold Path * The Twelve Insights of the Four Noble Truths * Proclamation of release from the cycle of rebirth (commonly referred to as nibbana) * The Opening of the Dhamma Eye (the attainment of right view) * Proclamation of the devas upon the setting of the Wheel of Dhamma in motion by the Buddha * Response of the Buddha to Aññā Kondañña's comprehension of his teachings Buddhist understanding of the sutta According to the Buddhist tradition, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is the first teaching given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha attained enlightenment and liberation while meditating under the Bodhi Tree by the Nerañjarā river in Bodh Gaya. Afterwards, he remained silent for forty- nine days. The Buddha then journeyed from Bodhgaya to Sarnath, a small town near the sacred city of Varanasi in central India. There he met his five former companions, the ascetics with whom he had shared six years of hardship. His former companions were at first suspicious of the Buddha, thinking he had given up his search for the truth when he renounced their ascetic ways. But upon seeing the radiance of the Buddha, they requested him to teach what he had learned. Thereupon the Buddha gave the teaching that was later recorded as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which introduces fundamental concepts of Buddhist thought, such as the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths. Development of the sutta The sermon in the Deer Park as depicted at Wat Chedi Liam, Thailand =Retaining the oldest teachings= Modern scholars agree that the teachings of the Buddha were passed down in an oral tradition for approximately a few hundred years after the passing of the Buddha; the first written recordings of these teachings were made hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing. According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings. While the Theravada tradition holds that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission,* academic scholars have identified many of such inconsistencies, and tried to explain them. Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, which are an important topic in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research. =Development of the sutta= According to Bronkhorst this \\"first sermon\\" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations. In the Vinaya texts, and in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened when the \\"vision of Dhamma\\" arises in him: \\"whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.\\" Yet, in the Ariyapariyesanā Sutta (\\"The Noble Search\\", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included, and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the \\"first sermon\\" which include the four truths, such as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, omit this instruction, showing that According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions. According to Bronkhorst, the \\"twelve insights\\" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term \\"prajna\\" for the more specific \\"four truths\\". =The \\"essence\\" of Buddhism= According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that \\"this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date.\\" According to Richard Gombrich, Yet, the understanding of what exactly constituted this \\"very essence\\" also developed over time. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \\"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\\" \\"Liberating insight\\" came to be defined as \\"insight into the four truths,\\" which is presented as the \\"liberating insight\\" which constituted the awakening, or \\"enlightenment\\" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was \\"enlightened\\" and liberated, as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: \\"his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.\\" The four truths were superseded by pratityasamutpada, and still later by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. According to Anderson, a long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an \\"overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to nibbana.\\" The sutras form a network or matrix, which have to be taken together. Within this network, \\"the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,\\" but are a part of \\"the entire dhamma matrix.\\" The four noble truths are set and learnt in that network, learning \\"how the various teachings intersect with each other,\\" and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths. According to Anderson, Translations into English =From the Pali version= In the Pāli Canon, this sutta is found in the Samyutta Nikaya, chapter 56 (\\"Saccasamyutta\\" or \\"Connected Discourses on the Truths\\"), sutta number 11 (and, thus, can be referenced as \\"SN 56.11\\").

They were dedicated to opposing occult threats. The group was composed of Ariann Wight, Dr. Chan Liuchow, Dr. Katherine Reynolds, Martin Gold, Jennifer Kale, and Omen/Charles Blackwater. Later, Omen brought private investigator Leena Wolfe onto the team, but she has not been shown in action with them. The group was created by Steve Gerber and Whilce Portacio. Publication history Dr. Chan Liuchow was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, first appearing in Strange Tales #89, the discoverer and original opponent of Fin Fang Foom, who in the group's eponymous two-issue prestige format mini-series, became possessed by a demon, Aan Taanu. Gerber had previously introduced Dr. Katherine Reynolds as a supporting character to Daimon Hellstrom in Marvel Spotlight #14, and Martin Gold as a supporting character to Lilith, Daughter of Dracula in Vampire Tales #6, while Jennifer Kale debuted in Adventure into Fear #11, which was Gerber's first story for Marvel. The other members of the team were introduced specifically for the series. Man-Thing appeared in the series as well, but only in a vision, in which the normally mute and non-sentient character was able to speak with Jennifer. Gerber expressed interest in writing about the characters again, but Marvel has not. The only follow-up to the initial prestige format limited series was a backup story in Midnight Sons Unlimited #9. Plot The story of the limited series deals with the suicide of Charles Blackwater, whose soul is morphed into Omen, and the visions of Dr. Katherine Reynolds, now a patient in a mental institution, who keeps saying \\"Fin Fang Foom\\". Reynolds, who had previously worked with Daimon Hellstrom, was abducted by a group known only as The Agency and given drugs that enhanced her latent psionic powers.Legion of Night #1 Jennifer Kale, now in college and living with an overweight boyfriend, Bernard Drabble, has not used her magic in years (she was last seen midwifing the \\"birth\\" of Quagmire through Man-Thing in Marvel Comics Presents vol. 1 #29), but suddenly feels compelled to, and receives encouragement from Man-Thing when she dreams that he is sitting next to her on an airplane.Legion of Night #2 In China, Dr. Chan is trying to explain to officials that there is a new part of the prophecy of Fin Fang Foom that he has only recently uncovered. In New York, Martin Gold is now working for a paranormal magazine, having previously done hard journalism. He has rethought his life after his relationship with Angel O'Hara and her possession by Lilith.Legion of Night #1 Omen summons the team to the apartment of Charles Atwater, whom Omen had recently resurrected in order to take control of his body.Legion of Night #1-2 Blackwater was forced to commit suicide by a former client, The Beyond Reason Spiritual Fellowship, which was resurrecting their hedonistic god, Aan Tanu, through the body of Fin Fang Foom. The Fellowship was based on a rare religious tome that its male leader, Reeve Calder, believed was a hoax. Its female leader, Hildreth, mates with Aan Tanu to create a demonic child. Ariann, however, rips the child out of her womb and kills it.Legion of Night #2 Notes References * *The Legion of Night at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe * External links *The Legion of Night at the Marvel Universe *The Legion of Night at the Marvel Database Project Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber ","title":"The Legion of Night"},{"id":"5645786","text":"Sainikudu () is a 2006 Indian Telugu-language political action film written and directed by Gunasekhar and music composed by Harris Jayaraj. It stars Mahesh Babu and Trisha in the lead roles. Irrfan Khan is the main antagonist (his only South Indian film),https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional- cinema/story/mahesh-babu-on-sainikudu-co-star-irrfan-s-demise-brilliant-actor- gone-too-soon-1672422-2020-04-29 and Prakash Raj, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Telangana Shakuntala, and Ajay play supporting roles. Balasubramaniam handled the camera work while Sreekar Prasad handled the editing. Sainikudu was released on 16 November 2006 and was a disaster at the box office, and the music was released on 21 October 2006. Plot The story starts with floods at Ranga Saipet in Warangal District. Houses, trains, and people inundate in floodwater. A young man named Siddharth (Mahesh Babu) and his friends save the people up to their maximum effort. Eight of his friends assist him in the rescue. On the other hand, the Chief Minister (Kota Srinivasa Rao) recommends the candidature of Parakala Pappu Yadav (Irrfan Khan) for Assembly Elections. Pappu Yadav is a goonda who wishes to earn big through politics and power. To get the attention of people, he announces a sum of Rs. 5 crore for flood victims. The food that needs to reach the victims of the flood is taken elsewhere to be sold, an illegal way of earning money and backing up the flood relief fund into the pockets of the politicians. Siddharth learns of this through one of his friends and saves the stock in time. He then takes it to the flood victims for distribution. This annoys Pappu Yadav, for which Mondi Nani (Prakash Raj), his right-hand, threatens Siddharth. A strife develops between Mondi Nani and Siddharth, and the latter declares that his friend Ajay Kumar (Ajay) will be contesting the next Assembly Election opposite Pappu Yadav. Siddharth and his team get accolades from the people for this decision and start campaigning. To cut the good name of the group in the people and to win sympathy, Pappu Yadav conspires for a bomb blast allegation on Siddharth and his team. Mondi Nani works for him and the mission is accomplished. Pappu Yadav declares Siddharth and his team as terrorists. He wins the election, becomes the Home Minister, and his marriage is settled with Varalakshmi (Trisha). Siddharth, with the help of many college students, kidnaps Varalakshmi from the marriage hall, demanding that Pappu Yadav state his crimes before a court of law. Varalakshmi is handcuffed and gagged with tape. The rest of the film shows Pappu Yadav chasing Siddharth to get Varalakshmi back while Siddharth and Varalakshmi fall in love while she is held captive. Finally, Siddharth puts an end to the game of crooked politicians.

It was founded as a result of the \\"Uganda Broadcasting Corporation Act, 2004\\", which merged the operations of Uganda Television (UTV) and Radio Uganda. It started broadcasting on November 16, 2005. The Uganda Broadcasting Corporation Act stated that the UBC should be funded by the levying of a television licence fee. Collection of a licence fee set at USh20,000 (around €8.40 or US$10.80) started in 2005. However, collection was subsequently halted by President Yoweri Museveni. There has since been pressure to reinstate the licence fee to maintain UBC's independence. UBC operates the UBC TV channel and five radio stations. Until May 2011, Edward Musinguzi was the managing director. He was fired along with all of the governing board for \\"massive corruption\\" involving unpaid salaries, the sale of land owned by the corporation, and advertisements sold during the 2010 World Cup. Location The broadcast studios and main offices of UBC are located at 17–19 Nile Avenue, Nakasero Hill, in Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. The geographic coordinates of Uganda Broadcasting Corporation headquarters are: 0°18'59.0\\"N, 32°35'21.0\\"E (Latitude:0.316389; Longitude:32.589167). Re- organization When he assumed office in 2016, Frank Tumwebaze, the Information and ICT Minister, established an ad-hoc committee to look into the affairs of the broadcaster. The ad-hoc committee found that UBC was in debt and had too many employees, whom it paid poorly and utilized them sub- optimally, among other infractions. A team was set up to address the short- comings. The pay-roll was reduced from 525 to 349 people. To weed out the 176 who need to be let go, all 525 members of staff were instructed to re-apply, if interested. Those who opt for retirement or early retirement would be provided with appropriate retirement packages. The changes, which are expected to take effect starting July 2018, are projected to reduce the wage bill from USh4.5 billion (approximately US$1.25 million) annually to USh3.5 billion (approximately US$955,000). In October 2018, the company hired Maurice Mugisha, formerly \\"Head of News Production\\" at NTV Uganda, to serve as its new Deputy Managing Director.

Rigby played twelve seasons in the North American Soccer League, three in the Major Indoor Soccer League, one in the Western Soccer Alliance and earned six caps with the United States men's national soccer team. Rigby was the color commentator with the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer. Player =Youth= Rigby, the son of school teachers, was born in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. He played soccer while a student at Ridley High School in Folsom, Pennsylvania and continued on the collegiate level at East Stroudsburg (PA) State University and was named a first team All-American in 1972. =Professional= In 1973, Philadelphia Atoms coach Al Miller, an alumnus of East Stroudsburg University, took Rigby as the first pick in the 1973 NASL college draft. Miller was building his team for the Atoms, which were an expansion franchise that year. Miller had watched Rigby play and was familiar with his excellent athleticism and technical ability. Rigby did not disappoint Miller. He set a league record of 0.62 goals allowed as a rookie that stood until the end of the league. That year, Philadelphia became the first U.S. professional team in any sport to win a championship their first year in existence.Philadelphia Atoms: An Opportunity Wasted Rigby became a local and league hero and found himself on the cover of the September 3, 1973 Sports Illustrated. Rigby continued to provide positive exposure to the young NASL when he took fourth place in ABC's 1976 Superstars, a televised athletic competition pitting athletes from various sports. February 1974 saw Rigby involved in another significant first. The NASL was toying with the idea of indoor soccer and the Atoms hosted the Red Army of Moscow team in Philadelphia's Spectrum. This was one of the first indoor games to use the configuration familiar to future indoor leagues, an astroturf covered ice rink with small goals set into the far walls. While the Red Army team won, 6-3, its coach had high praise for Rigby who had stopped 33 of the Soviets' 39 shots.The History of Indoor Soccer in the United States The New York Cosmos acquired Rigby for the 1976 season, only for him to get injured. The Cosmos then brought in Shep Messing to replace him in goal and shipped Rigby to the Los Angeles Aztecs at the end of the season. After three season in Los Angeles, Rigby returned to Philadelphia to play for the Fury. The Fury actually acquired Rigby from the Tulsa Roughnecks who got Rigby from the Aztecs the day prior. The Fury attempted to build on the Atoms' popularity by bringing back several fan favorites, but the team only lasted two seasons due to incompetent management. As Rigby was moving back to Philadelphia, the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) was beginning its first season. The next year, the local MISL club, Philadelphia Fever, which had used a largely amateur team its first season, negotiated an associate relationship with the Fury to use several Fury players in its second season.REMEMBERING THE \\"PSEUDO-ATOMS\\"--THE PHILADELPHIA FURY, 1978–1980 As a result, the Fury loaned Rigby to the Philadelphia Fever for the 1979–1980 Major Indoor Soccer League season. In 1981, Rigby moved to the Montreal Manic for two seasons before moving to the Golden Bay Earthquakes for the 1982–1983 MISL season. He remained with the Earthquakes for the 1983 and 1984 NASL outdoor season. When the NASL folded after the 1984 season, Rigby was signed by the Chicago Sting on September 19, 1984 for a 15-day contract. The Sting released him at the end of the fifteen days and the Tacoma Stars offered him a contract. Rigby declined the offer to concentrate on his landscaping business.\\"Injuries pose dilemma Bell may regret 'no-trade' edict\\" San Diego Union Wednesday, March 6, 1985 In February 1985, he signed with the Stars after they again offered him a contract.\\"SCIOSCIA WINS, SISK, KOOSMAN LOSE IN ARBITRATION\\" THE SEATTLE TIMES Friday, February 15, 1985 He spent most of the season as a backup to John Baretta. At the conclusion of the season, Rigby moved back to the Earthquakes, renamed the San Jose Earthquakes. In 1985, the Earthquakes joined with three independent west coast teams to play the Western Alliance Challenge Series. This was the genesis of the short lived Western Soccer Alliance/League. Rigby shared the goal with Hunter Stern during this challenge series and retired from playing at the end of it.1985 WSA Stats Rigby was named to two NASL Second All-Star teams, in 1973 and 1974. =National and Olympic teams= The mid-1970s also saw Rigby play for both the U.S. Olympic and U.S. national teams. While Rigby travelled with the U.S. team to the 1972 Summer Olympics, he did not play. Mike Ivanow played the first two games and Shep Messing the third.

SMOG is an acronym for \\"Simple Measure of Gobbledygook\\". SMOG is widely used, particularly for checking health messages. The SMOG grade yields a 0.985 correlation with a standard error of 1.5159 grades with the grades of readers who had 100% comprehension of test materials. The formula for calculating the SMOG grade was developed by G. Harry McLaughlin as a more accurate and more easily calculated substitute for the Gunning fog index and published in 1969. To make calculating a text's readability as simple as possible an approximate formula was also given — count the words of three or more syllables in three 10-sentence samples, estimate the count's square root (from the nearest perfect square), and add 3. A 2010 study published in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh stated that “SMOG should be the preferred measure of readability when evaluating consumer-oriented healthcare material.” The study found that “The Flesch-Kincaid formula significantly underestimated reading difficulty compared with the gold standard SMOG formula.” Applying SMOG to other languages lacks statistical validity. Formulae To calculate SMOG #Count a number of sentences (at least 30) #In those sentences, count the polysyllables (words of 3 or more syllables). #Calculate using #: #: \\\\mbox{grade} = 1.0430 \\\\sqrt{\\\\mbox{number of polysyllables}\\\\times{30 \\\\over \\\\mbox{number of sentences}} } + 3.1291 This version (sometimes called the SMOG Index) is more easily used for mental math: # Count the number of polysyllabic words in three samples of ten sentences each. # Take the square root of the nearest perfect square # Add 3 SMOG conversion tables compiled by Harold C. McGraw are slightly inaccurate because they are based on the approximate formula. Furthermore, tables for texts of fewer than 30 sentences are statistically invalid, because the formula was normed on 30-sentence samples.

The film is an adaptation of the 1997 novel The Ax by Donald E. Westlake, and follows the attempts by a laid-off employee to get back on his feet. He eventually becomes so desperate that he is prepared to kill his job competitors. Synopsis The 39-year-old chemist Bruno Davert has been working at a paper mill for 15 years, improving products and saving money for the shareholders. One day, the company announces that it is forced to \\"downsize\\", so 600 staff are laid off and many of their jobs are instead outsourced to a company in Romania. The result is a 16% increase in dividends to the company shareholders. Bruno was one of the 600 laid off, and two years later he has still not been able to find another job, in spite of numerous job applications. He has lost his self- esteem and his family has been forced to give up many of its accepted comforts, such as cable TV and the internet, although his wife has taken two part-time jobs in order to keep them afloat. Bruno concludes that there is too much competition in his sector for the few jobs available, and so in desperation he decides to literally eliminate his competitors, by killing those more qualified than him.

In 2003, the parade started from the American Airlines Center and ended at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie. This was a landmark year for the parade, which included not only the addition of two branches of military representation, but also the addition of Martin's own replica 1966 Batmobile as the pacecar. Remembering 9/11 In 2004, the event moved to a landmark day for police and fire agencies, September 11. The parade ran from the American Airlines Center to Texas Stadium in Irving. It was at the 2004 parade that Martin announced changes for the parade. As of September 11, 2004, the parade was no longer to be known as the RMS Police and Fire Parade, but instead to be called the Heroes Parade because it more accurately described the group of people the parade was established to celebrate.

He was lustrated as a kshullaka into the Sangha (holy order) by Devappa (Devakirti) Swami. He took his ailaka (religious vows) before an image of the Tirthankara Neminatha. In about 1920, Shantisagar became a full muni (monk) of the Digambara sect of Jainism. In 1922, at Yarnal village, Belgaum district, Karnataka, he was given the name \\"Shanti Sagara\\" (\\"Ocean of Peace\\").

The title of Acharya pada (teacher of philosophy) was awarded to Muni Virasagar. Padmanabh Jaini writes about his Sallekhana: His lineage (parampara) He had handed over the leadership to the next Acharya Virasagar (1955–1957). He was followed by, in sequence, Acharya Shivasagar (1957–1969), Dharmasagar (1969–1987), Ajitasagar (1987–1990) and then Vardhamansagar (since 1990) who currently leads his sangha.

The Trichogrammatidae are a family of tiny wasps in the Chalcidoidea that include some of the smallest of all insects, with most species having adults less than 1 mm in length, with species of Megaphragma having an adult body length less than 300 μm. The over 840 species are placed in about 80 genera; their distribution is worldwide. Trichogrammatids parasitize the eggs of many different orders of insects. As such, they are among the more important biological control agents known, attacking many pest insects (especially Lepidoptera). They are not strong fliers and are generally moved through the air by the prevailing winds. Their fore wings are typically somewhat stubby and paddle-shaped, with a long fringe of hinged setae around the outer margin to increase the surface area during the downstroke. Males of some species are wingless, and mate with their sisters inside the host egg in which they are born, dying without ever leaving the host egg. Trichogrammatidae have unique nervous systems resulting from the necessity to conserve space. They have one of the smallest nervous systems, with one particularly diminutive species, Megaphragma mymaripenne, containing as few as 7,400 neurons. They are also the first (and only) known animals which have functioning neurons without nuclei. The neurons develop during pupation with functional nuclei and manufacture enough proteins to last through the short lifespans of the adults. Before emerging as an adult, the nuclei are destroyed, allowing the wasp to conserve space by making the neurons smaller.

The settlement, which is near the village of Mildenhall, was occupied from the 2nd century CE by Romano-British people until the post-Roman period. It was abandoned in the early 5th century. The entire town lay undiscovered until it was identified from aerial photos in the 1940s. Archaeological excavations have revealed that the town was a substantial urban area defended by large masonry walls. Artefacts recovered from the site include kitchenware, personal effects, and two hoards of Roman coinage. History A silver Roman coin found in the Cunetio Hoard. The Cunetio site has been known since the 19th century, when local antiquarians conducted sporadic excavations. The full scale and importance of the site, however, was identified from aerial photos of crop marks taken in 1940, and the site has been sporadically excavated since the 1950s alongside the continuation of aerial photography to further map the site.Corney, M. 1997. The Origins and Development of the 'Small Town' of Cunetio, Mildenhall, Wiltshire. Britannia. 28. 337-350. In the 1960s, a small coin hoard was found, followed in 1978 by the much larger Cunetio Hoard of over 55,000 coins. The site was dug and geophysically surveyed in 2009 by Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team, which found many more coins and other objects. The town grew around a mansio that had been built near a crossroad of two minor Roman roads. As the town grew, it developed a regular grid of streets and stone buildings on its eastern side but retained less regular and substantial structures in the west part. The settlement's original defences were earthworks and an outer ditch; in the 4th century CE, these were replaced by massive stone walls wide, a large western gateway, and 17 semi-octagonal, external wall-towers. The masonry walls ran inside and parallel with the original defences on the east side but outside of them on the south and west sides. The stone towers were approximately every apart. Excavations of the west gate show it was flanked by two towers and possibly possessed a set of iron-gates similar to a portcullis, because grooves were found in the remains of the towers' footings. Archaeological examinations of the site do not reveal why Cunetio deserved so much expenditure on upgrading its defences, an act that was a very rare occurrence for inland Britannia at the time when most Roman military engineering projects were focused on the Saxon Shore forts. Two theories have been suggested: first that the town was being converted into a Legionary fortress to reestablish Roman authority in this part of the province of Britannia. Second, that the improvement work was being orchestrated by an ambitious local British governor – the type of man who would, within a generation or so, be setting himself up as a war-lord or regional chieftain. Interpretation therefore swings between the Roman Empire re-establishing its authority after various rebellions and uprisings, or Roman authority breaking down. In the 3rd century, the town was a prosperous settlement, and by the start of the 4th, it had become a hub of villas. It has also been suggested that the town was reorganised as a centre of taxation, administration, and military functions later in the 4th century AD, coinciding with the addition of the defensive stone wall.Corney, M. 1997. p. 349 However, the Roman withdrawal from Britain 410 caused Cunetio to rapidly decline in importance, until it was totally abandoned.

Publication history The five versions first appear in Avengers #131 (Jan. 1975); Avengers Annual #16 (Dec. 1987); Avengers West Coast #61 (Aug. 1990); Avengers #353 (Sep. 1992) and Avengers vol. 3, #10 (Nov. 1998) respectively. The groups were created by Steve Englehart and Sal Buscema; Tom DeFalco and various artists; Roy Thomas and Daniel Bulanadi; Len Kaminski and Chris Eliopoulos and Kurt Busiek and George Pérez. A new version of the legion was created by James Aaron this n his 2019 run on The Avengers. Fictional character biography =Legion of the Unliving I= The original Legion appears during the Celestial Madonna storyline in the titles Avengers and Giant-Size Avengers, having been summoned from time by the villain Kang the Conqueror (at the suggestion of his future self Immortus) to kill the superhero team. As the name implies, the members of the Legion were all characters established as being deceased in Marvel continuity, being pulled from time a moment before their deaths. Although partially successful in their mission (the original Human Torch kills Iron Man and the Vision is wounded), the Legion frees itself from Kang's control and aid the Avengers. Kang flees when confronted by the Thunder God Thor, with Immortus reviving Iron Man and healing the Vision and returning the Legion back to their respective eras. Only the Human Torch android is allowed to remain as it is revealed that the character is in fact the Vision, years before being modified by the robot Ultron.Avengers #131 - 132 (Jan. - Feb. 1975); Giant-Size Avengers #3 (Feb. 1975) =Legion of the Unliving II= The second version of the Legion is featured in an Avengers annual, in which the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster, usurps the power of the entity Death. Intending to destroy the universe -- via six bombs -- and recreate it with his fellow Elders, the Grandmaster decides to eliminate opponents the Avengers (including the West Coast Avengers) by having fellow Elder the Collector take the heroes (and ally the Silver Surfer) to the Realm of Death to battle the Legion of the Unliving. A battle to the death follows, and when Thor observes fellow Asgardian the Executioner act dishonourably he realizes the Legion are in fact only copies of the original beings, minus their personalities. Almost all the Avengers are killed stopping the Legion and defusing the bombs, with only Captain America and Hawkeye surviving. The Grandmaster then proposes another competition and adds the fallen heroes to the Legion, until tricked by Hawkeye in a game of chance. Losing the game disorients the Grandmaster and Death is released, with the entity banishing all the Elders from its realm, restoring all heroes to life and then returning them to Earth.Avengers Annual #16 (Dec. 1987) =Legion of the Unliving III= The third version of the Legion appears in the title Avengers West Coast, and is created by reoccurring Avengers foe Immortus. Seeking to use the Scarlet Witch as a nexus point from which to control all of time, Immortus summons the Legion to delay the pursuing Avengers, although they are almost totally defeated by the heroes. Immortus himself is judged by the entities the Time Keepers and forced to become the nexus himself.Avengers West Coast #61 (Aug. 1990) =Legion of the Unliving IV= A fourth version appears in the title Avengers, with the former villains' spirits summoned and placed in the bodies of dead civilians -- effectively zombies -- by Avengers foe the Grim Reaper (empowered by a demon called Lloigoroth) who mistakenly believes the Avengers had murdered him. When the character is confronted by the Vision and forced to accept that he actually committed suicide, the Legion rebel. Grim Reaper panics and is attacked and apparently consumed by Lloigoroth, with the Legion's spirits departing the corpses.Avengers #353 (Sep. 1992) =Legion of the Unliving V= The fifth version of the Legion appears in the third volume of the title Avengers, with the returning spirit of the Grim Reaper corrupting his brother Wonder Man and using him to summon former Avengers who died in battle. The Scarlet Witch, however, uses her love for Wonder Man to free him from the limbo-like state his ionic form was in, thereby freeing him from the Reaper's control. Wonder Man is then able to restore the Reaper to a physical form. The humbled villain relinquishes control of the Legion, and the dead heroes speak to their comrades a final time before dying once again.Avengers vol. 3, #10 (Nov. 1998) =Legion VI= A new Legion is created by Colonel Shadow in his vampire civil war, whose membership includes a bat-like vampire named Carpathian, Baroness Blood, Boy-Thing, Rat Bomber, Snowsnake, and his dog Sarge.Avengers Vol8 Is 12 Membership References External links * Legion of the Unliving at Marvel Wiki * Legion of the Unliving (I) at marvunapp.com Category:Marvel Comics supervillain teams ","title":"Legion of the Unliving"},{"id":"5646030","text":"Lute of Pythagoras The lute of Pythagoras is a self-similar geometric figure made from a sequence of pentagrams. Constructions The lute may be drawn from a sequence of pentagrams. The centers of the pentagraphs lie on a line and (except for the first and largest of them) each shares two vertices with the next larger one in the sequence... An alternative construction is based on the golden triangle, an isosceles triangle with base angles of 72° and apex angle 36°. Two smaller copies of the same triangle may be drawn inside the given triangle, having the base of the triangle as one of their sides. The two new edges of these two smaller triangles, together with the base of the original golden triangle, form three of the five edges of the polygon. Adding a segment between the endpoints of these two new edges cuts off a smaller golden triangle, within which the construction can be repeated.. Some sources add another pentagram, inscribed within the inner pentagon of the largest pentagram of the figure. The other pentagons of the figure do not have inscribed pentagrams.. Properties The convex hull of the lute is a kite shape with three 108° angles and one 36° angle. The sizes of any two consecutive pentagrams in the sequence are in the golden ratio to each other, and many other instances of the golden ratio appear within the lute.

They established supply-lines from United States and Canada with the help of the Danish ambassador in Washington, Henrik Kauffmann. From 1941 until the end of the war Aksel Svane was situated in US to organize the supplies and Eske Brun became governor of South Greenland as well. The administration was centralized in Godthåb (Nuuk). After the war Eske Brun was made vice-president of the Greenland Administration (Grønlands Styrelse) (in 1947).

The Front de la Jeunesse was in 1983 convicted for being a private militia. WNP disappeared in 1984: its leader Paul Latinus was found dead in his girlfriend's home in April of that year, and the other members came into conflict. Pastorale murders Marcel Barbier, a WNP member, was convicted in May 1987 for a gruesome double murder at a synagogue on the la rue de la Pastorale in Anderlecht on February 18, 1982. One of the victims, Alphonse Vandermeulen, had been married to Barbier's current girlfriend, Marcelle Gobert. The police interrogated Barbier and his girlfriend, and searched both their homes, but no arrests were made. The police investigation into the murders was without success until August 16, 1983, when a violent incident occurred at Barbier's home in Saint-Gilles. Barbier was arrested, and when the police searched his home they found confidential NATO material, various weapons and neo-Nazi material. It also turned out that Barbier was a former member of the Front de la Jeunesse, and was currently a member of a neo-Nazi organization called Chevalerie teutonique. Barbier was convicted and jailed for this violent incident, but the investigation into the Pastorale murders continued. During the interrogation of Barbier, the police found out about Westland New Post, although it was later revealed this organization was already known to the Belgian State Security Service, with an agent (albeit on his own initiative) already infiltrating the organization at the end of 1981, but the intelligence service did not communicate what it knew to the police or judiciary services. The police then investigated the WNP members to find out whether it was a private militia. Paul Latinus told the police that Barbier and another WNP member were behind the murders. Latinus had helped Barbier getting rid of the murder weapon and other relevant evidence. Barbier was the only person convicted for this murder, although other WNP members were suspect. NATO documents During the investigation of the incident at Barbier's home, the police found confidential NATO documents. Barbier told the police they were not his, but the possession of another WNP member, Michel Libert. Michel Libert worked as a military volunteer at the NATO Transmission Centre in Evere. Latinus, leader of WNP, was interrogated multiple times by the police and would confess to the stealing of confidential NATO documents. Security at the Centre was not high, and Libert delivered the documents to Latinus, who later published some of the material in the two editions of the WNP Althing magazine, which was delivered to, among others, military personnel. Latinus told the police that this was on behalf of his 'American superiors', to wake up the military command at NATO that leaks were happening, with only material on the Soviet Union being published in the Althing. Later it turned out more WNP members worked at the NATO Transmission Centre, and would deliver material, via Libert, to Latinus. Brabant killers In October 2014, the Belgian police apprehended Michel Libert, the former no. 2 of the organization. He was interrogated as a suspect in the Brabant killers case and his house was searched. The Belgian public television station RTBF alleged that Westland New Post had performed reconnaissance actions on the stores that later would be attacked by the Brabant killers. M. Libert had previously been interviewed several times as a witness. He left the court as a free man. The search of his house did not reveal anything that pointed to a possible connection with the Brabant Killers. WNP and the Belgian State Security Service Westland New Post was infiltrated by an agent of the Belgian State Security Service, Christian Smets. Smets already knew Paul Latinus, and Latinus previously worked as informant about the \\"extreme left\\" for the State Security. He was also an agent for some American intelligence service. Latinus himself tried to become an agent of the State Security, successfully passing the first exam, but he flew to Chile in January 1981 when the magazine Pour published an article in which he was depicted as an \\"extreme-rightist\\" infiltrating \\"extreme left\\" organizations. Latinus returned to Belgium somewhat later, and founded WNP with Marcel Barbier and Michel Libert. In the organizational structure of WNP, Christian Smets was responsible for operational details, and taught the members about surveillance and intelligence gathering. One exercise of Smets supposedly took place just before the Pastorale murders, where members of WNP were given the task to shadow what later turned out to be one of the murder victims. Smets himself in later parliamentary testimony denied this proposition by former WNP members, but admitted giving intelligence exercises. The last contacts between Smets and WNP occurred in June 1982, when Smets was transferred to the sector Brussels of the Secret Services, becoming responsible for VIP protection. Latinus at this time would stop being an informant for State Security, but Michel Libert would continue his relationship. According to Libert, Smets wrote an article in the anti-communist Nouvel Europe Magazine in March 1983, on the topic of \\"State Security prepares an extreme-right coup d'état?\\" Shortly after the Barbier incident Libert's relations to State Security would be severed, and the responsible group of State Security would be put off the WNP case. Latinus suicide The Belgian police found the dead body of Paul Latinus in the evening of April 24, 1984, at the home of his girlfriend in Court-Saint-Étienne, after her notification. The police found him lying on the floor of a basement, with strangulation marks around his neck, but no other signs of violence or disorder. They found a telephone cord that was cut. The girlfriend explained to the police that she found him when she came home from a bar, and that she cut the line between Latinus' head and the ceiling. The body would be removed for burial, but the next day a judge ordered a house search. The girlfriend was again interrogated, and told the police that Latinus had a file Pinon, that had information on certain 'partouzes' of high- placed functionaries, involving minors. She said she had burned the file, after having shown it to an acquaintance. An autopsy was made that same day on the body of Latinus. The acquaintance that might have more information on the case was later found to have moved to Spain, before the Latinus suicide, but he was not further interrogated. During the investigation into the death of Latinus, several WNP members would find it hard to believe that Latinus committed suicide, because he never gave a hint in that direction and had no reason to commit such an act. They found it more plausible that it was in fact a camouflaged murder, because he had a lot of compromising information on other people. Forensic tests were carried out in the basement in the winter of 1985, to check against the weight of Latinus, to see if the cord wasn't supposed to snap. Nothing conclusive came from this though, and an analysis of a certain quick strangulation method was also not found to be in agreement with the marks on Latinus's neck. The investigative team found no reason to continue the investigation, and thus the case Latinus was closed in the autumn of 1986. The remains of Latinus were exhumed in 1998, when the investigative team of the Brabant Killers, the cell-Jumet, tried to find out if the DNA of Latinus could be brought into connection with the Brabant massacre, but no positive results were found.

It is set in a desert landscape of cactus and mesquite bush, with large Saguaro cacti particularly prominent. The peak was named after mountain man Pauline Weaver. Weavers Needle has played a significant role in the stories of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. The Needle's shadow reportedly indicates the location of a rich vein of gold, and many treasure hunters have searched for it. The hunt for gold around Weavers Needle has been pursued by hundreds (possibly thousands) of people. Weavers Needle has a large split in the side that makes it look like it has two tops, not one. This can only be viewed from the side. Weaver's Needle can be climbed as a four-pitch route. Each of the pitches is rated a 5.0 or less, with the second pitch being more of a class 4 scramble. The route is trad, and opportunities for protection with traditional gear are ample. No permit is required to hike to Weaver's Needle, or to climb, or to camp at the top. Highly experienced climbers will often free-solo, and rappel from the fixed anchors at the top. Despite the relatively low rating of the climb, this is not recommended for beginner or intermediate climbers.

It created the largest accidental oil spill in history, lasting 18 months and releasing of crude oil. Midway-Sunset was one of the largest oil reserves in the United States. When drilling commenced, the Lakeview Oil Company expected natural gas and a small amount of oil. Instead, there was a large blowout which overloaded storage tanks. The geyser released more than of crude oil, far more than any other single leak on land or water. Its site is located about a half-mile (800 m) east of the Taft–Maricopa Highway, California Route 33, marked by a Caltrans guide sign and a bronze plaque designated as California Historical Landmark number 485. Background The Lakeview Oil Company started drilling at its Number One well on 1 January 1909. Initially only natural gas was found. As work continued the company partnered with the Union Oil Company, which wanted to build storage tanks there. Early twentieth- century drilling technology lacked such modern safety features as blowout preventers. When drilling reached a well depth of on 15 March 1910, pressurized oil blew through the well casing above the bit. An estimated escaped before the gusher was brought under control in September 1911. The initial daily flow was , creating a river of crude that crews rushed to contain with improvised sand bag dams and dikes.

If there were no forces of gravitation or air resistance, the cannonball should follow a straight line away from Earth, in the direction that it was fired. If a gravitational force acts on the cannonball, it will follow a different path depending on its initial velocity. If the speed is low, it will simply fall back on Earth. (A and B) for example horizontal speed of 0 to 7,000 m/s for Earth. Speed of cannonball at 0 m/s launched horizontally from Newton's very tall mountain. Speed of cannonball at 6,000 m/s launched horizontally from Newton's very tall mountain. If the speed is the orbital speed at that altitude, it will go on circling around the Earth along a fixed circular orbit, just like the Moon. (C) for example horizontal speed of at approximately 7,300 m/s for Earth. Speed of cannonball at 7,300 m/s launched horizontally from Newton's very tall mountain.

The protein encoded by this gene is member of the TGFβ superfamily. Bone morphogenetic proteins are known for their ability to induce bone and cartilage development. BMP5 may play a role in certain cancers. Like other BMP's BMP5 is inhibited by chordin and noggin. It is expressed in the trabecular meshwork and optic nerve head and may have a role in the development and normal function. It is also expressed in the lung and liver. This gene encodes a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family which is part of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. The superfamily includes large families of growth and differentiation factors. Bone morphogenetic proteins were originally identified by an ability of demineralized bone extract to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site. These proteins are synthesized as prepropeptides, cleaved, and then processed into dimeric proteins. This protein may act as an important signaling molecule within the trabecular meshwork and optic nerve head, and may play a potential role in glaucoma pathogenesis.

Significance Shipping costs have historically been calculated on the basis of gross weight in kilograms or pounds. By charging only by weight, lightweight, low density packages become unprofitable for freight carriers due to the amount of space they take up in the truck/aircraft/ship in proportion to their actual weight. The concept of dimensional weight has been adopted by the transportation industry worldwide as a uniform means of establishing a minimum charge for the cubic space a package occupies. In fact, UPS and FedEx both announced that starting 2015, shipping charges on all shipments (air and ground) will be determined by greater of the actual weight and dimensional weight of a package. Prior to this announcement, dimensional weight charges were only applicable to packages of a specific size range. Weight calculation Dimensional weight is a calculation of a theoretical weight of a package. This theoretical weight is the weight of the package at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of the package. The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension in each of the three axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of the package. However, if the package is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of the package. Dimensional weight is also known as DIM weight, volumetric weight, or cubed weight. Freight carriers utilize the greater of the actual weight or dimensional weight to calculate shipping charges. Dimensional weight is calculated as (length × width × height) / (dimensional factor). Measurements can be made all in inches or all in centimeters, but the appropriate shipping factor must also be used. Shipping factors for imperial measurements represent cubic inches per pound (in3/lb) while metric factors represent cubic centimeters per kilogram (cm3/kg). These are the inverse of the package density. Dimensional weight is applied when the actual product density is less than the minimum density represented by the chosen factor. Dimensional weight is representative of the weight of the package at the minimum density accepted by the freight carrier. Shipping factors are not only different for imperial and metric measurements, but also for shipment mode and in some cases between different customers. Shipping factors will be available from the freight carrier. Some common factors are listed below. Imperial shipping factor examples: * 139 in3/lb = 12 lb/ft3 * 166 in3/lb = 10.4 lb/ft3 \\\\- common for IATA shipments * 194 in3/lb = 8.9 lb/ft3 \\\\- common for domestic shipments * 216 in3/lb = 8.0 lb/ft3 * 225 in3/lb = 7.7 lb/ft3 * 250 in3/lb = 6.9 lb/ft3 Metric shipping factor examples: * 5000 cm3/kg = 200 kg/m3 * 6000 cm3/kg = 166.667 kg/m3 * 7000 cm3/kg = 142.857 kg/m3 When calculating the dimensional weight with metric measurements, the length, width, and height are measured in centimeters (cm) and the result is stated in a nominal kilogram (kg) dimensional weight band (usually rounded up).

For example, a box of clothing shipped internationally which weighs 10 pounds and measures 18 × 18 × 18 inches would be charged as if it weighed 36 pounds: (18 x 18 x 18)/166 = 35.1 pounds which is then rounded up to 36 pounds for shipping cost purposes. The 35.1 pounds is the 'theoretical\\" weight of the package if it had a density of 166 in3/lb or 10.4 lb/ft3: (18 × 18 × 18) = 3.375 ft3 × 10.4 lb/ft3 = 35.1 lb. Note that for the USPS there are two different calculations for DIM weight: (L × W × H)/194 for domestic shipments and (L × W × H)/166 for international shipments. Several programs are available to calculate dimensional weight: Measurement Technology DIM Weight Calculator or Dim Weight Calculator Practical application Dimensional weight favors shippers of dense objects and penalizes those who ship lightweight boxes. A box of unpopped corn kernels will likely be charged by gross weight; a box of popcorn will probably be charged by its dimensional weight. This is because the large box of popcorn takes up a lot of space but does not fill up a vehicle's capacity in terms of weight, making it an inefficient use of space. Shippers avoid dimensional weight charges by using smaller boxes, by compressing their goods, and by reducing the use of packing materials. =Commercial use= Dimensional weight is commonly used for invoicing by air freight forwarders, truck carriers, as well as all commercial airlines worldwide. In 2007, DHL, FedEx, United Parcel Service and USPS adopted the dimensional weight system for ground services. In May 2007, the United States Postal Service (USPS) adopted dimensional weight, calling it \\"Shape Based Postage Pricing\\". This rate system is designed to charge more for lightweight items, and also to recover costs involving manual sorting and handling, since many postal machines are built to handle flats. This system would charge much more for mailing a parcel than a flat envelope. It encourages mailing books and DVDs in flat paperboard or plastic envelopes, rather than padded mailers. Such companies use automated systems called dimensioners for calculating both dimensional and actual weight and invoice their customers accordingly. More and more transport and logistics companies including warehouses and retailers are investing in dimensioning equipment for calculating the dimensional weight of their packages in order to keep in line with their carriers and avoid back charges. Cube weight is used in less than truckload shipping (LTL) to fill trailers with small heavy objects in them with light weight large objects to increase load factor. Generally cube and weight are reference data from the shipment table.

It is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults, with an annual incidence of 7–8 cases per 100,000 people per year in the US and UK. This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age of diagnosis at ~70 years, although it can occur in young adults and, in rare cases, children. DLBCL can arise in virtually any part of the body and, depending on various factors, is often a very aggressive malignancy. The first sign of this illness is typically the observation of a rapidly growing mass or tissue infiltration that is sometimes associated with systemic B symptoms, e.g. fever, weight loss, and night sweats. The causes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not well understood. Usually DLBCL arises from normal B cells, but it can also represent a malignant transformation of other types of lymphoma (particularly marginal zone lymphomas) or, in rare cases termed Richter's transformation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An underlying immunodeficiency is a significant risk factor for development of the disease. Infections with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, human immunodeficiency virus (i.e. HIV), and the Helicobacter pylori bacterium are also associated with the development of certain subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, most cases of this disease are associated with the unexplained step- wise acquisition of increasing numbers of gene mutations and changes in gene expression that occur in, and progressively promote the malignant behavior of, certain B-cell types. Diagnosis of DLBCL is made by removing a portion of the tumor through a biopsy, and then examining this tissue using a microscope. Usually a hematopathologist makes this diagnosis. Numerous subtypes of DLBCL have been identified which differ in their clinical presentations, biopsy findings, aggressive characteristics, prognoses, and recommended treatments. However, the usual treatment for most subtypes of DLBCL is chemotherapy combined with a monoclonal antibody drug that targets the disease's cancerous B-cells, usually rituximab. Through these treatments, more than half of all patients with DLBCL can be cured; the overall cure rate for older adults is less than this but their five-year survival rate has been around 58%.  Subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma encompasses a biologically and clinically diverse set of disease subtypes, many of which are difficult to separate from one another based on well-defined and widely accepted criteria. The World Health Organization, 2008, classification system defined more than a dozen subtypes, each of which was identified based on the location of the tumor, the presence of other cell types such as T cells in the tumor, and whether the patient had certain other illnesses related to DLBCL. Based on further research, the World Health Organization, 2016, reclassified DLBCL into its most common subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS). DLBCL, NOS represents 80-85% of all DLBCL. The remaining DLBCL cases consist of relatively rare subtypes that are distinguished by their morphology, (i.e. microscopic appearance), immunophenotype, (i.e. expression of certain marker proteins), clinical findings, and/or association with certain pathogenic viruses. Some cases of DLBCL, NOS, while not included in the 2016 World Health Organization's classification, are clearly associated with, and caused by, chronic infection by the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified = DLBCL cases that do not fit the distinctive clinical presentation, tissue morphology, neoplastic cell phenotype, and/or pathogen-associated criteria of other DLBCL subtypes are termed Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified: DLBCL, NOS, while representing 80-85% of all DLBCL cases, is a diagnosis of exclusion. In general, DLBCL, NOS is an aggressive disease with an overall long-term survival rate in patients treated with standard chemotherapy regimens of ~65%. However, this disease has many variants that differ not only in the just cited parameters but also in their aggressiveness and responsiveness to treatment.  Presenting signs and symptoms  About 70% of DLBCL, NOS cases present primarily with lymph node disease. In these cases, the most typical presenting symptom at the time of diagnosis is a mass that is rapidly enlarging and located in a part of the body with multiple lymph nodes such as the groin, arm pits, or neck. In the remaining ~30% of other cases, the disease begins as an extranodal lymphoma, most commonly in the stomach, or, less commonly, in other sites such as the testicles, breasts, uterus, ovaries, kidneys, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, or bone. The presenting signs and symptoms in these cases reflect the presence of a rapidly expanding tumor or infiltrate that produces symptoms specific to the organ of involvement such as increased size, pain, and/or dysfunction. Individuals with nodal or extranodal disease also present with: systemic B symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, fevers, and/or fatigue in ~33% of cases; unexplained elevations in their blood levels of lactic acid dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin in many cases; malignant cells infiltrating their bone marrow in 10-20% of cases; and/or localized Stage I or II disease in up to 50% of cases and disseminated Stage III or IV disease in the remaining cases. Bone marrow involvement may be due to DLBCL, NOS cells or low grade lymphoma cells; only DLBCL, NOS cell infiltrates indicate a worse prognosis. Uncommonly, DLBCL may arise as a transformation of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in individuals who have been diagnosed with this indolent cancer 4–5 years (median times) previously. = Prognostic indicators based on clinical presentation = The International Prognostic Index and more recently, the Index's age-adjusted variant use age >60 years, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, low performance status, and involvement in more than one extranodal site as contributors to a poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL, NOS. In addition, disease that initially involves the testes, breast, or uterus has a relatively high rate of spreading to the central nervous system while disease initially involving the kidneys, adrenal glands, ovaries, or bone marrow has a high rate of spreading to other organs, including the central nervous system. All of these cases as well as cases initially involving the central nervous system have relatively poor to very poor prognoses. Cases initially involving the stomach, thyroid, or a single bone site have relatively good prognoses.  Pathophysiology  Most cases of DLBCL, NOS appear to result at least in part from the step-wise development of gene changes such as mutations, altered expressions, amplifications (i.e. increases in the number of copies of specific genes), and tranlocations from normal sites to other chromosomal sites. These changes often result in gains or loses in the production or function of the product of these genes and thereby the activity of cell signaling pathways that regulate the maturation, proliferation, survival, spread, evasion of the immune system, and other malignant behaviors of the cells in which they occur. While scores of genes have been reported to be altered in DLBCL, NOS many of these may not contribute to DLBCL, NOS. Changes in the following genes occur frequently in, and are suspected of contributing to, this disease's development and/or progression. *BCL2: This gene is a protooncogene, i.e. a normal gene that can become cancer-causing when mutated or overexpressed. Its product, Bcl-2 protein, regulates cellular apoptosis (i.e. survival) by inhibiting the apoptosis-causing proteins, Bcl-2-associated X protein and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer. *BCL6: This genes' product, Bcl-6, is a repressor of transcription that regulates the expression of other genes which control cell maturation, proliferation, and survival. *MYC: This protooncogene's product, Myc, encodes a transcription factor which regulates the expression of other genes whose products stimulate cell proliferation and expansion to extra-nodal tissues. *EZH2: This gene's product, the EZH2 protein, is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase. It thereby regulates the expression of other genes which control lymphocyte maturation. *MYD88: This gene's product is a signal transducing adaptor protein essential for the transduction of interleukin-1 and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. It thereby regulates NF-κB and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and survival. *CREBBP: This gene's product is a transcriptional coactivator; it activates numerous transcription factors, some of which control cell proliferation. *CD79A and CD79B: these genes' products are critical components of the B-cell receptor. Mutations in either gene can cause uncontrolled cell activation and proliferation. *PAX5: this gene's product, Pax-5, is a transcription factor that controls the development, maturation, and survival of B-cells; it also controls expression of the MYC gene in these cells. As a consequence of these gene changes and possibly other changes that have not yet been identified, the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS exhibit pathologically overactive NF-κB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT0, MAPK/ERK, B-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, and NF-κB signaling pathways and thereby uncontrolled pro-malignant behaviors.  Diagnosis  Microscopic examinations of involved tissues reveal large neoplastic cells that are typically classified as B-cells based on their expression of B-cell marker proteins (e.g. CD20, CD19, CD22, CD79, PAX5, BOB1, OCT2, an immunoglobulin [usually IgM but occasionally IgG or IgA)], CD30, and in ~20-25% of cases PD-L1 or PD-L2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2 are transmembrane proteins that normally function to suppress attack by the immune system). These cells arrange in a diffuse pattern, efface the tissues' architecture, and resemble Centroblast cells (80% of cases), Immunoblast cells (8-10% of cases), or anaplastic cells (9% of cases; anaplastic cells have bizarre nuclei and other features that may mimic the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin disease or the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma). Rarely, these neoplastic cells are characterized as having signet ring or spindle shaped nuclei, prominent cytoplasmic granules, multiple microvillus projections, or, when viewed by electron microscopy, tight junctions with other cells. These neoplastic tissue infiltrates are often accompanied by small non-malignant T-cell lymphocytes and histiocytes that have a reactive morphology.  Variants of DLBCL, NOS  The World Health Organization, 2016, requires that the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS be further defined based on whether they are derived from germinal center B-cells (i.e. GBC) or activated B-cells (i.e. ABC) as identified by gene expression profiling (GEP) or are GBC or non-GBC as identified by immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. As identified by GEP, which measures all cellular messenger RNAs, GBC and ABC represent about 50 and ~35% of DLBCL, NOS cases, respectively, with ~15% of cases being unclassifiable. IHC analyses measure the cellular expression of specific proteins using a panel of fluorescent antibodies that bind to and therefore stain a set of key proteins. For example, one commercially available panel uses three antibodies to detect CD10, BCL6, and MUM1 proteins; GBC express whereas ABC and unidentified cells do not express these proteins; accordingly, this as well as other IHC panels classify ABC and undetermined neoplastic cell types together as non-GBC. Individuals with the ABC, unclassifiable, and non-GBC variants have significantly worse prognoses than individuals with the GBC variant: respective 5 year progression-free and overall survival rates have been reported to be 73-80% for GBC variants and 31-56% for ABC variants. Clinically, however, most DLBCL, NOS cases are analyzed by IHC and therefore classified as either GBC or non-GBC variants with non-GBC variants having progression-free and overall survival rates similar to those of the ABC variants. Gene and protein markers in the neoplastic cells of DLBCL, NOS that have clinical significance include CD5, MYC, BCL2, BCL6, CD20, CD19, CD22, CD30, PD-L1, and PD-L2. The 5-10% of DLBCL, NOS cases in which the neoplastic cells express CD5 have a very poor prognosis that is not improved by even aggressive treatment regimens. Cases in which fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis show that the neoplastic cells' in this disease bear translocations in both the MYC and BCL2 genes or MYC and BCL6 genes (termed double hit lymphomas) or in all three genes (termed triple hit lymphomas) are associated with advanced disease that spreads to the central nervous system. These lymphomas, termed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC, BL2, and/or BL6 rearrangements or, more simply, DH/THL, are regarded as borderline DLBCL,NOS. They represent 6-14% of all DLBCL, NOS and have had long-term survival rates of only 20-25%. Another variant B-cell lymphoma that is also considered to be a borderline DLBCL, NOS is termed high-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBCL, NOS). These two aggressive borderline B-cell lymphomas were previously grouped together as \\"B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma\\" (i.e. BCLU) but were separated into DH/THL and HGBC, NOS by the World Health Organization, 2016. The neoplastic cells in a related variant, double expresser lymphoma (i.e. DEL), express the products of MYC and BCL2 genes, i.e. c-Myc and bcl-2 proteins, respectively, but do not have translocations in either of their genes. DEL, which represents about one-third of all DLBCL, NOS cases, has a poorer prognosis than standard DLBCL, NOS but not as poor as DH/THL cases. Cases in which the neoplastic cells have alterations in the MYC gene or its expression without changes in BLC2 or BLC6 also have a poor prognosis, particularly in cases where the MYC gene translocates (i.e. rearranges) with one of the immunoglobulin gene loci. DLBCL that begin in the testicles are a variant of DLBCL, NOS that some authors suggest should be classified as a distinct DLBCL subtype. This variant, termed Primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PT-DLBCL), is a DLBCL, NOS that in >75% of cases involves activated B-cells , i.e. ABC. These cells, which typically have a centroblast- like morphology, infiltrate one or, in ~6% of cases, both testicles. PT-DLBCL is an aggressive disease that often spreads to the central nervous system and has median overall survival and progression-free survival times of 96 and 49 months, respectively. The neoplastic cells in almost all cases of DLBCL, NOS express CD20. Commercially available anti-CD20 antibody agents such as rituximab or Obinutuzumab (which is sometimes used in place of rituximab) kill cells that express high levels of CD20 by binding to this cell-surface protein and thereby targeting them for attack by the hosts adaptive immune system. The addition of one of these immunotherapy agents to chemotherapy protocols has greatly improved the prognosis of most DLBCL, NOS variants. Neoplastic cell expression of CD30, found in 10-15% of DLBCL, NOS cases is a favorable prognostic indicator. As indicated in the following Treatments and prognoses section, expression of the CD20 and CD30 proteins as well as the CD19, CD20 CD22, CD30, CD79A, CD79B, and D-L1 proteins, expression of the MYC, BCL2, MYD88nd, and CREBBP genes, and expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT, B-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, and NF-κB signaling pathways are being studied as potential therapeutic targets for the individualized treatment of GBC and ABC/non-GBC DLBCL, NOS cases.  Treatments and prognoses  = First-line therapy = First-line therapy for patients with the GBC variant of DLBCL, NOS is R-CHOP. R-CHOP consists of rituximab, three chemotherapy drugs (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, and oncovin) and a glucocorticoid (either prednisone or prednisolone). The regimen achieves cure, relapse following remission, and unresponsive rates of 60-70%, 30-40% and <10%, respectively, in GBC variant cases. Relapses generally occur within the first 3 years of diagnosis with few cases doing so after 5 years. Patients who are refractory to, relapse within 1 year of diagnosis before starting, relapse within 6 months after completing, or progress within 2 years of starting R-CHOP have poorer prognoses. R-CHOP is less effective and not recommended for patients who have MYC, BL2, and/or BL6 rearrangements regardless of their GBC, ABC, or non-GBC type. One recommendation for treating these DH/THL cases is the DA-R-EPOCH regimen (dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisolone, oncovin, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxydaunorubicin). S-R-EPOCH achieves 2 year survival rates of 40-67% compared to a ~25% survival rate for R-CHOP in these cases. DA-R-EPOCH has also been recommended for patients with double expresser lymphoma although some experts recommend treating this variant more like a typical DLCBL, NOS. First-line therapy for patients with the ABC, undetermined, or non-GBC variants has been the DA-R-EPOCH regimen. Patients with these variants (including those with double expresser lymphoma) have had a ~40% cure rate when treated with it. A randomized clinical trial conducted in France reported that a R-ACVBP chemotherapy regimen (rituximab, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and cytarabine followed by sequential consolidation therapy with systemic methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide, and then cytarabine) achieved significantly better response rates than R-CHOP in ABC/NGC variant cases lymphoma. In DLBCL, NOS variants which trend to spread or to the central nervous system, methotrexate has been recommended to be added to regimens not containing it for use as prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of this complication. The role of Autologous stem-cell transplantation as an addition to first-line therapy in the treatment of DLBCL, NOS, including cases with a poor prognosis, is unclear. A phase I clinical research trial found that the addition of lenalidomide to the R-CHOP regimen produce an ~80% complete response rate in GBC as well as non- GBC DLBCL, NOS variants. Two phase III clinical research trials are underway to confirm these results and determine if the R-CHOP + lenalidomide regimen is superior to R-CHOP in the up-front treatment of GBC and/or non-GBC variants. = Treatment of recurrent and refractory DLBCL, NOS = Patients with DLBCL, NOS who relapse or progress following first-line therapy have been treated wit \\"salvage regimens\\" consisting of high-dose (also termed high- intensity) chemotherapy conditioning drugs followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. This regimen has attained 3 year progression-free survival rates of 21-37%. Relapse following this treatment carries a very poor prognosis with median overall survival times of ~10 months. Patients who have failed or because of health issues are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation have been treated with low-dose (i.e. low-intensity) chemotherapy conditioning regimens followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This regimen has achieved 3 year progression-free and overall survival rates of 41% and 52%, respectively. Further studies are underway to determine the best treatment regimens for these cases. Patients refractory to first-line therapy or who relapse within 12 months of receiving salvage therapy (including bone marrow transplant) for recurrent disease have had poor prognoses with median overall survival rates of 3.3 and 6.3 months, respectively. Thee prognosis of these patients appears to be improved by using CAR-T therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (i.e. CAR-T) adoptive cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a recent advance in treating refractory and relapsed DLBCL, NOS. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are genetically engineered to express: 1) an artificial T-cell receptor consisting of antigen- recognition and attached hinge domains expressed on their surface membranes; 2) a surface membrane-spanning domain; 3) an intracellular domain which, when the antigen-recognition domain binds its targeted antigen, activates signaling pathways that cause the T-cell to attack and kill cells that bear the recognized antigen on their surface membranes; and 4), in more recently devised second generation CAR-T strategies, an associated intracellular co- stimulating molecule (e.g. CD28 or 4‐1BB) which augments activation of the cell-killing signaling pathways. CAR-T therapy, as it pertains to DLBCL, NOS, kills a patient's neoplastic B-cells by isolating this patient's T-cells; genetically engineering these cells to express an artificial T-cell receptor designed to bind an antigen expressed on the surface of their neoplastic B-cells; and infusing these cells back into the donor patient. The targeted antigen has usually been CD19, a surface membrane protein expressed on virtually all B-cells including the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS. However, design of CARs as well as the antigens chosen to be their targets are constantly being changed in order to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. CAR-T therapy for DLBCL, NOS has been used on patients who are refractory to and/or have progressed on first-line as well as salvage (including autologous stem cell transplantation) treatment regimens. Patients are treated first with a conditioning chemotherapy regimen, usually cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and then infused with their own T-cells that have been engineered to attack CD19-bearing or, rarely, CD20-bearing cells. A meta-analysis of 17 studies using this or very similar approaches to treat DLBCL, NOS found the treatments gave complete and partial responses rates of 61% and 43%, respectively. While these studies did not have control groups and were too recent for meaningful estimates of remission durations, the remission rates were higher than expected using other treatment approaches. Significant and potentially lethal therapeutic complications of this therapy included development of the cytokine release syndrome (21% of cases), neurotoxicity, i.e. the CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (9% of cases), and the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage-activation syndrome (i.e. a form of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). Individual studies within and outside of this meta-analysis have reported remissions lasting >2 years but also lethal cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity responses to this therapy. As a consequence of these studies, the Committee for Advanced Therapies and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommend granting marketing authorization for tisagenlecleucel (i.e. chimeric antigen receptor T cells directed against CD19) in adult patients with DLBCL, NOS who have relapsed after or are refractory to two or more lines of systemic therapy. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency recommends tisagenlecleucel retain its orphan drug designation. The USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved the use of this drug for relapsed or refractory DLBCL of the large B-cell lymphoma subtype in patients who have failed after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD19, CD22, CD30, and PD-L1 have been developed for use as immunotherapeutic agents in other hematological malignancies and are being or plan to be tested for their usefulness in DLBCL, NOS. In August of 2020, the FDA approved the humanized Fc-modified cytolytic CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL = Emerging therapies = Neoplastic cell expression of CD30 in DLBCL, NOS is a favorable prognostic indicator; in these cases, brentuximab vedotin may be a useful addition to chemotherapy treatment protocols. This agent is a CD30-targeting antibody that delivers a toxin, monomethyl auristatin E, to CD30-expressing cells, has therapeutic efficacy against other CD30-expressing lymphomas, and may prove useful in treating the 10-15% of DLBCL, NOS cases expressing this protein. The neoplastic cells in the GBC variant of DLBCL, NOS often have mutations in the EZH2, BCL2 and CREBBP genes and overactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK-STAT signaling pathways while neoplastic cells in the ABC variant often have mutations in the MYD88, CD79A and CD79B genes and overactive B-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, and NF-κB signaling pathways. These different gene mutations and dysregulated signaling pathways are also being studied as potential therapeutic targets for the individualized treatment of GBC and ABC/non-GBC cases. CUDC-907, an inhibitor of PI3K and histone deacetylases, is being evaluated in two separate clinical trials for the treatment of refractory and/or relapsed DLBCL, NOS including cases with alterations in the MYC gene. GSK525762, an inhibitor of the BET family of proteins, suppresses expression of the MYC gene and is undergoing a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC, BL2, and/or BL6 rearrangements (i.e. DH/THL). RO6870810, another BET inhibitor, in combination with Venetoclax, an inhibitor of the Bcl-2 protein, is likewise in a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of DH/THL. = Subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma = DLBCL subtypes have been sorted into groups based on their distinctive morphology or immunophenotype, distinctive clinical issues, and distinctive virus-driven etiology. The prognoses and treatment of these subtypes varies with their severity. Most subtypes are aggressive diseases and consequently treated in a manner similar to DLBCL,NOS. Further details on these subtypes, including their treatments, can be found in their respective main article linkages.  DLBCL with a distinctive morphology or immunophenotype  = T cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma = T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a DLBCL in which tumors containing small numbers of usually large neoplastic B-cells embedded in a background of reactive T-cells and histiocytes develop in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and/or, rarely other sites. Patients usually present with advanced disease; their overall 3 year survival rates in different studies range between 46% and 72%. = ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma = ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+ LBCL) is a DLBCL in which neoplastic lymphocytes that express the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor protein infiltrate lymph nodes as well as extranodal sites, e.g. the mediastinum, bones, bone marrow, nasopharynx, tongue, stomach, liver, spleen, and skin. About 60% of these individuals present with advanced disease. ALK+ LBCL has an overall 5 year survival rate of ~34%. = Plasmablastic lymphoma = Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a DLBCL in which neoplastic immunoblastic or plasmablastic cells embedded in a background of other cell types infiltrate the oral/nasal cavity or much less often the gastrointestinal tract. Some 70% of individuals with PBL are infected with EBV and/or (particularly those with oral/nasal cavity disease) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PBL is an aggressive disease with a median survival time of ~15 months. = Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma = Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a DLBCL in which medium- to large-sized neoplastic B-cells infiltrate small- to medium-sized blood vessels and sinusoids in the liver, spleen, and/or bone marrow. IVLBCL may be associated with the hemophagic syndrome (i.e. excessive cytokine secretion and systemic inflammation). Patients afflicted with the latter syndrome have very short survival times. The poor prognosis of this disease has been significantly improved by rituximab or similar immunochemotherapy drugs but significant proportions of these responding cases relapse, often with central nervous system involvement. = Large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement = Large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement (LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement) is a DLBCL in which tissue infiltrates containing intermediate- or large-sized neoplastic B-cells strongly express a chromosomal translocation involving the IRF4 gene on the short arm of chromosome 6. These cells form follicular, follicular and diffuse, or entirely diffuse infiltrates in Waldeyer's tonsillar ring or other regions of the head and neck. The disease, which represents ~0.05% of all DLBCL, occurs primarily in children and young adults and typically has a good prognoses. Cases with a follicular pattern of tissue infiltrates often have indolent disease and an excellent prognosis following excision and may not need chemotherapy. Cases with a purely diffuse tissue infiltrate pattern, in contrast, often do require chemotherapy.  DLBCL with distinctive clinical issues  = Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma = Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), also termed primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma, is a DLBCL in which neoplastic B-cells infiltrates are commonly located in sclerotic/fibrous tissues of the thymus and mediastinal lymph nodes. The disease represents 6–10% of all DLBCL cases, presents with early stage disease in ~80% of cases, and has an overall survival rate at 5 years of 75-85%. = Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type = Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT) is a DLBCL in which diffuse patterns of immunoblastic and/or centroblastic B-cells infiltrate the dermis and/or subcutaneous tissue principally, but not exclusively, of the legs. This disease's 5-year overall survival rate is 50–60%. = Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system = Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (DLBCL-CNS, also termed primary central nervous system lymphoma [PCNSL]) is a DLBCL in which diffuse patterns of neoplastic B-cells with centroblastic, immunoblastic, or poorly differentiated features infiltrate the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eye. The disease usually presents as a single lesion with a predilection for the supratentorial region of the brain but may involve the eye in 15–25% of cases, the cerebrospinal fluid in 7–42% of cases, and the spinal cord in ∼1% of cases. The disease has a 5-year overall survival rate of ~30%. = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation (DLBCL-CI) is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease arising in persons with a long and persistent history of chronic inflammation. The disease's lesions consist of large, mature-appearing B-cells infiltrating the lung's pleura and nearby tissues. Most cases have occurred in patients who were given a pneumothorax (i.e. therapeutic introduction of air into the chest cavity in order to collapse and thereby \\"rest\\" the lung) to treat pulmonary tuberculosis that had progressed to a pyothorax (i.e. pus in the pleural cavity). Fibrin-associated large B-cell lymphoma (FA-DLBCL), often considered a sub-type of DLBCL-CI, is an infiltration of large neoplastic B-cells and fibrin affix to a prosthesis (e.g., cardiac valve, orthopaedic device) or accumulate within a hydrocele, pseudocyst, cardiac myxoma, or chronic subdural hematoma. The B-cells in these lesions are often but not always infected with the Epstein-Barr virus. DLBCL-CI occurring in cases of pleural empyema (sometimes termed pyothorax-associated lymphoma, i.e. PAL) is an aggressive lymphoma with a five-year overall survival rate of 20–35%; FA-DLBCL, when involving the heart (e.g. occurring on myxommas or prosthetic valves) or vasculature structures (e.g. on thrombus-laden vascular grafts), may involve life-threatening cardiovascular complications, particularly strokes. Outside of these complications, however, DLBCL-CI usually has a highly favorable outcome. = Lymphomatoid granulomatosis = Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is a DLBCL in which large, atypical B-cells with immunoblastic or Hodgkin disease-like features that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus center around and destroy the microvasculature. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis almost always involves the lung but may concurrently involve the brain, peripheral nervous system, skin, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and/or upper respiratory tract; LYG has an increased incidence in persons with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome or HIV or who are immunosuppression due to chemotherapy or organ transplantation. The disease's prognosis is highly variable: patients with low grade disease often require no therapy except watchful waiting while patients with high grade disease usually require chemotherapy. = Primary effusion lymphoma = Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a DLBCL in which neoplastic B cells that resemble immunoblasts, plasmablasts, or Reed–Sternberg cells infiltrate the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal membranes that surround the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs, respectively. This infiltration leads to the seeping of fluid into the cavities which are encased by these membranes, i.e. it leads to pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and abdominal ascites. Some cases of PEL also involve the gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes. The disease occurs primarily in people who are immunosuppressed or test positive for HIV and are also latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; PEL is an aggressive disease with an overall 1 year survival rate of ~30%.  DLBCL driven by viruses  = Epstein–Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified = Epstein–Barr virus-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (EBV+ DLBCL, NOS) is a B-cell lymphoma in which neoplastic B-cells that are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus cause a disease that does not fit into other subtypes of DLBCL. In EBV+ DLBCL, small neoplastic B-cells, other lymphocyte typess, plasma cells, histiocytes and epithelioid cells interspersed with Reed-Sternberg-like cells infiltrate, almost exclusively, lymph nodes. Elderly patients with the disease have median survival times of ~2 years while young patients have long-term treatment-related remissions in >80% of cases. = HHV8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS = HHV8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS (HHV8+ DLBCL, NOS; also termed HHV8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [HHV8+ DLBCL]) is a DLBCL in which Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus- infected, medium- to large-size neoplastic B-cells that resemble lymphocytes or immunoblasts infiltrate lymph nodes (~80% of cases) and, when disseminated (20% of cases), the liver and spleen. This infiltration usually disrupts the normal architecture of the involved tissues. HHV8+ DLBCL develops in HIV- infected individuals in ~50% of cases, in individuals with multicentric Castleman disease, plasma cell variant in uncommon cases, and in individuals with Kaposi sarcoma in rare cases. HHV8+ DLBCL commonly takes an aggressive course and has a poor prognosis.  Related disorders  = Helicobactor pylori associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma = Rare cases of DLBCL are associated with the presence of the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, in the neoplastic B-cells. While the histology of Helicobactor pylori-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (H. pylori+ DLBCL) is typical of DLBCL, the disease is sometimes a progression of mantle cell lymphoma, is often restricted to the stomach, is less aggressive that most DLBCL cases, and may respond to a drug regimen consisting of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors directed at killing the bacterium. Perhaps because of these features of the disease, H. pylori+ DLBCL has not been classified as a DLBCL by the World Health Organization, 2016. Recent studies suggest that localized, early-stage H. pylori+ DLBCL, when limited to the stomach, is successfully treated with H. pylori eradication protocols consisting of two or more antibiotics plus a proton pump inhibitor. However, these studies also agree that patients treated with one of these H. pylori eradication regimes need to be carefully followed: those unresponsive to, or worsening on, these regimens should be switched to a chemotherapy regimen (e.g. R-CHOP) and/or, for complicated bulky disease, surgery and/or local radiotherapy. = Epstein–Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer = Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) was first described as a lymphoproliferative disorder in which Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-cells proliferate and cause ulcerations in the mucous membranes and skin of immunosuppressed individuals. Its lesions consist of Epstein-Barr virus-positive, variable-sized, atypical B-cells that by conventional histopathologic criteria indicate the lesions are a form of DLBCL. Since these lesions regress spontaneously without anti-cancer treatment, EBVMCU is now considered a pseudo-malignant disorder. Elderly individuals that evidence the disease but have no other cause for immunosuppression may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously. Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to rituximab. Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy generally have a remission after the dosage of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatments are reduced. Most of these patients do not relapse.

The National Park Service is in the process of planning the future of this park and its facilities The Friends of Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run Inc., a privately funded foundation, paid for all activities on the farm, while the land is owned by the National Park Service. They receive only certain maintenance tasks from the Park Service.\\"NPS Closes Virginia Farm It Provides No Resources, Staff To\\" , Director The Farm is located in Langley, Virginia, a suburb of McLean, Virginia, next to the George Bush Center for Intelligence and the Turner- Fairbank Highway Research Center. Market Fair events were held at the park. The mission of Turkey Run was to recreate the life of 1771 tenant farmers. The vast majority of Virginians in 1771 were tenant farmers who grew tobacco to pay their rent and grew food to eat. By contrast, Colonial Williamsburg demonstrates the life of the small upper crust -- merchants and landowners. History Male and female turkeys at the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, Langley, Virginia Originally named Turkey Run Farm when it opened in July 1973 as a National Park Service operation, it was renamed in 1981 for local land developer, Dr. Claude Moore, whose large bequest at the time of his death allowed the farm park to establish itself as the only autonomous site in the park system. It takes no NPS funding and operates off of the dividends of its endowment, volunteer run fundraising efforts and donations from the public. The Farm operation has expanded its facilities over the years. The GateHouse Giftshop was built to replace the old on-your-honor admission fee drop box and an event deck and the Bounty Garden were all added at the front parking lot during the last decade. Post 9-11, a new access road was cut through the upper pasture so that access to the farm office no longer passes through the security gate of the Federal Highway Administration headquarters, behind the CIA grounds. \\"Chez Puce,\\" formally the site of the farm's alternating book and \\"garage\\" sales, became a full-fledged, used bookstore, open Wednesday through Saturday, in 2011. Park operations Turkey Run was run by a small paid professional staff, supplemented by many volunteers both behind the scenes and in costume. The interpretive staff, including pre-teens and teenagers who portrayed the farm children, demonstrate 1771 farm life, including field work, crafts, cooking, and other special activities. Staff (including volunteers) used \\"first person\\" to demonstrate living history and help visitors feel as if they've stepped back in time. The Farm's heirloom crops and heritage breed livestock were carefully researched to provide as accurate an atmosphere as possible. The Farm cooperated with Fairfax County in providing work-release parolees with court-required employment. On a working farm, this means labor. =Market Fair= Musical entertainment at the Market Fair at the Claude Moore Colonial Farm The highlight was the Market Fair, held the third full weekends of May, July, and October. The Fair was enhanced by the participation of a cadre of long-time volunteers, including a blacksmith, cabinet maker, milliner, herb and flower seller, a toy store, scriptorium, puppet theatre, potter, chair bodger, chicken roasting, a tavern and more. The importance of the tavern in Colonial life was captured on the sign displayed therein: \\"Beer is proof that God loves us, and wants us to be happy. --Benjamin Franklin.\\" Many of the participants were members of American Revolutionary War (and other) re-enactor groups and appear at other colonial historical events. The gathering and threshing of wheat and the preparation of the tobacco crop were annual events. A colonial Wassail, including the blessing of the orchard, was the final event of the season, in mid-December. =Schedule and events= As of December 21, 2018, the Farm is no longer open to visitors.

Originally viewed as a top prospect for the New York Yankees he was unable to replicate the success of his rookie year and played for two major league ballclubs over five years. Professional career He was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 22nd round of the 1986 draft after attending the University Of California. He made his major league debut for Yankees on June 29, 1990 when they called him up from the Columbus Clippers. It was hoped that he would be the heir to Don Mattingly. His first Major League hit was a single off of Jack McDowell. He started his big league career on a tear, setting a record for the fewest at bats (72) to hit 10 home runs. He also set a record for fastest rookie to 13 and 15 with 110 and 133 at-bats, thirteen fewer than Sam Horn took to reach 13 and two fewer than Wally Berger took to reach 15. He was helped by a three-game series at Texas when he homered in each game of the series. At the end of the 1990 season, Maas had hit 21 home runs in 79 games and he finished second in The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award voting to Sandy Alomar, Jr. of the Cleveland Indians. Like Mattingly, Maas was a left- handed batter. As a result, many of his home runs went into the right field stands. About halfway through the season a group of a dozen or so young ladies began wearing \\"Maas-tops\\" to Yankees home games and sitting in the right field stands. Whenever Maas hit a home run to right, the girls would get up, remove their tops and jump up and down until Maas finished circling the bases.Where are they now? Former Yankee Kevin Maas is a solid investment The following season he served as the Yankees designated hitter and occasional fill-in for Mattingly at first base. Even though he played in 148 games, his sophomore season was not as successful as his first. He did hit 23 home runs (in 500 at bats), but hit just .220 with 128 strikeouts. By 1992, Maas was shuffling back and forth between the major and minor leagues. He was released by the Yankees in 1994. He bounced around between San Diego, Cincinnati, and Minnesota. He briefly returned to the majors in 1995 with Minnesota but it was clear he was a \\"one hit wonder.\\" Maas then signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Central League in 1996 to replace Glenn Davis. Personal life As of 2008, Maas works at Charles Schwab as a financial consultant in his hometown of Castro Valley, California. He is divorced and has a daughter named Lacey and a son named Christian. He is regularly invited to Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium and participated in the 2008, 2011, and 2017 games.

(ESB) was founded in 1894 by a civil engineer, George R. Sikes. Letters inviting practicing engineers were sent soliciting membership. In November of that same year, a decision was made to form a \\"Society of Engineers\\"- in the committee room of the common council of the City of Buffalo. Membership has grown today to over 160 engineers in the Western New York area. The organization took on a distinct and clear operating structure - as evidenced by drafting of a constitution & by-laws- which are still in existence today. As needs dictate, the constitution may be amended following rules established by the Society. The ESB was incorporated in 1920 and, in more recent years, was declared as a non-profit organization. Contributions to the society are tax deductible. Business development continues to be a major focus. In January 2002, John Beishline was named Executive Director to lead the ESB in offering services to various technical societies. One of the most important aspects of the ESB is promoting the professional development of engineers in Western New York. This is done through a scholarship program and sponsoring of further education. The ESB supports academically qualified graduating high school seniors majoring in engineering at either University at Buffalo or Buffalo State College through the Scholarship Program. Since the inception of the scholarship awards in 1950, over 200 scholarships have been awarded. Total amount distributed is over $10,000 annually. Scholarships are primarily funded by the Annual Scholarship Run held each August. The ESB offers review courses for both the Fundamentals of Engineering (or EIT) exam as well as the Professional Engineering (PE) licensing exam- in all disciplines. Instruction is provided on a volunteer basis by member engineers with the appropriate license and training. Classes are held at the SUNY Buffalo, Amherst Campus.

Examples are the object models of Java, the Component Object Model (COM), or Object-Modeling Technique (OMT). Such object models are usually defined using concepts such as class, generic function, message, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. There is an extensive literature on formalized object models as a subset of the formal semantics of programming languages. # A collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate some specific parts of its world. In other words, the object-oriented interface to some service or system. Such an interface is said to be the object model of the represented service or system. For example, the Document Object Model (DOM) is a collection of objects that represent a page in a web browser, used by script programs to examine and dynamically change the page. There is a Microsoft Excel object model for controlling Microsoft Excel from another program, and the ASCOM Telescope Driver is an object model for controlling an astronomical telescope. An object model consists of the following important features: ;Object Reference: Objects can be accessed via object references. To invoke a method in an object, the object reference and method name are given, together with any arguments. ;Interfaces: An interface provides a definition of the signature of a set of methods without specifying their implementation. An object will provide a particular interface if its class contains code that implement the method of that interface. An interface also defines types that can be used to declare the type of variables or parameters and return values of methods. ;Actions: An action in object-oriented programming (OOP) is initiated by an object invoking a method in another object. An invocation can include additional information needed to carry out the method. The receiver executes the appropriate method and then returns control to the invoking object, sometimes supplying a result. ;Exceptions: Programs can encounter various errors and unexpected conditions of varying seriousness. During the execution of the method many different problems may be discovered. Exceptions provide a clean way to deal with error conditions without complicating the code. A block of code may be defined to throw an exception whenever particular unexpected conditions or errors arise. This means that control passes to another block of code that catches the exception.

It is one of only two U.S. facilities holding Steller sea lions, and it has the only beluga whales in New England. Special exhibits include a ray and shark touch pool, an African penguin exhibit, a jelly gallery, and the \\"Jurassic Giants\\" dinosaur exhibit. The aquarium is a member of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) and is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). It is a subsidiary of the Sea Research Foundation, Inc.  History  Beluga whale at Mystic Aquarium Mystic Aquarium was first opened in 1973 as a privately owned corporation. Industrialist and philanthropist Kelvin Smith was the primary shareholder; he chose Mystic, Connecticut as the site because of the area's scenic shoreline and rich maritime history. In 1999, the aquarium and Ballard's Institute for Exploration combined to form a $52 million expansion. The expansion features the Arctic Coast, a outdoor beluga whale display containing of water. The aquarium hosted several marine mammals from the Shedd Aquarium while it was undergoing renovation to its marine mammal habitat between September 2008 and May 2009. The National Geographic Society's Crittercam exhibit was set up at the aquarium in February 2011 but has since been removed. In 2012, Mystic Aquarium opened the Ocean Exploration Center featuring maps, diagrams, and models from Dr. Robert Ballard's explorations of the Black Sea and of the wreck of the RMS Titanic. Presentations in the Nautilus Live Theater told more of Ballard's recent explorations and the ship E/V Nautilus. Audience members had a live link to crew members on the ship at sea and could ask them questions directly. The aquarium opened Titanic – 12,450 Feet Below on April 12, 2012 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The exhibit was created by Ballard, who found the Titanic in 1985, and Tim Delaney, a former Walt Disney Imagineer. It was funded by a $1 million donation from United Technologies Corporation. The aquarium was presented with the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2014. The award was accepted by Sea Research Foundation's president Stephen M. Coan.\\"Mystic Aquarium receives National Medal from White House\\". Hartford Business, May 9, 2014. The Titanic exhibit was also remodeled into a new exhibit named Exploration: Wild in 2015, after Ballard ended his association with the aquarium.

Although there is some dispute about the founding of the first Scouting Group, both 1st Merrickville and 1st St. Catharines Scout Group have a documented existence from 1908. In 1955, the 8th World Scout Jamboree was held at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Scouting continues in Ontario to the present day, serving thousands of youths in programs that suit the environment in which they live.  Scouting organizations in Ontario  There are several Scouting organizations operating in Ontario. The largest of these is Scouts Canada, which had a combined youth and adult membership as of August 2007 of 99,573, down from 265,313 in 1990. While most Scouts Canada groups operate in English, some operate in French, and French language handbooks and resource material are available. Scouting in the French language is also provided under the auspices of L'Association des Scouts du Canada (sometimes referred to as Les Scouts). These groups are situated mostly in the eastern and north eastern parts of the province which have a higher concentration of francophone residents. Together, Scouts Canada and the Association des Scouts du Canada are members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). Ontario has several organizations which are not part of WOSM. In some cases, they were created because members felt that Scouts Canada had drifted too far from the program originally developed by Scouting's founder, Baden Powell. Some trace their roots to the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in the United Kingdom: * BPSA Ontario, which is part of BPSA in Canada. * Canadian Traditional Scouting Association * The Federation of North-American Explorers (FNE) are members of the Catholic International Union of Guides and Scouts of Europe and has groups in Thornhill, Toronto, and Ottawa. There are at least three ethnic or culturally based Scouting associations which operate in Ontario: * ZHR Polish Scouts of Canada (Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej w Kanadzie) was founded in 1996 and has units in the Greater Toronto Area and Peterborough, Ontario and is not affiliated to Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej in Poland. * Polish Scouting Association in Canada Incorporated (Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego Poza Granicami Kraju), a Polish émigré organization, also not connected to Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego in Poland. * Plast, a Ukrainian émigré organization. Plast is also the name of the National Scout Organization of the Ukraine.  Scouts Canada  = History of Provincial Council for Ontario = On December 21, 1910 his Excellency Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada and Chief Scout for Canada, together with His Honour J.M. Gibson, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Dr. K.A. Pyne, Ontario Minister of Education, and a number of prominent citizens from all parts of the province, met in Toronto to select gentlemen who are interested and who would assist in the Boy Scout Movement and form a Council for Ontario. For many years Scouts Canada scouting in Ontario was led by this Provincial Council for Ontario, under which operated numerous regional councils the exact number and geography of which changed over the years. However, in 2002 when Scouts Canada reorganized, the provincial council ceased to exist and the eight councils remaining in Ontario reported directly to the national council. An incorporated body still exists for the purpose of holding ownership of property as required by provincial laws.

Driven by declining membership, increasing costs, and liability issues, Scouts Canada conducted a property review in Ontario which concluded that dozens of camps should be sold. This has resulted in legal action between the Scouts Canada Ontario Incorporated Body and local Scouters. Action was underway in November 2005 and is ongoing. Scouts Canada's camps in Ontario are generally administered by one of the four Administrative Centres.

The group was founded by gay activist Bonte Minnema and chartered by Scouts Canada in 1999. Consistent with Scouts Canada policy, the group was co-ed. It made world headlines, including the BBC World News, when a story by Reuters first brought attention to the group's existence. In October 1999, American Pastor Fred Phelps and his congregation at the Westboro Baptist Church planned to protest outside the Ontario offices of Scouts Canada. However, Canada Customs denied them entry into the country. This prevented Phelps and his church members from appearing, and left supporters of the group to rally outside the offices without opposition. The group folded in 2001 due to a lack of interest.  Girl Guiding in Ontario  Mary Malcolmson organized the first Canadian Girl Guide Company to be officially registered in St. Catharines, Ontario; their registration is dated January, 1910. A park in St. Catharines was later named for Mary Malcolmson. Other Guide Companies were registered later in 1910, in Toronto. The First Toronto Company held the first-recorded Girl Guide Camp in Canada on the banks of the Credit River in June, 1911. By 1912, the movement had spread to all parts of Canada, and had become so popular that on July 24, 1912 Agnes Baden-Powell created Lady Mary Pellatt \\"Chief Commissioner of the Dominion of Canada Girl Guides\\". Many Guide events were held at her home, Casa Loma, in Toronto. It is now a tourist attraction with a special Girl Guide display. Guiding is now served by the Guiding in Canada - Ontario Council, with 44,000 girl members, 11,000 adults, 13 Areas and 37 camps throughout Ontario.  8th World Scout Jamboree  In 1955, the 8th World Scout Jamboree was held at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. This was the first World Jamboree to be held in the Western Hemisphere. The setting was a rolling parkland, and 11,000 Scouts attended this gathering, which was notable for the number of Scout contingents that crossed the Atlantic by air to attend—1,000 from Great Britain alone.  Scout memorials  Scouting memorials include: * E.T.

Randall Blackwood and Patricia Edelkind. There was physical and sexual abuse, exploitation of child labor, and deprivation of education from its inception in the early 1960s through to the mid 1980s. Opening in 1962, the center was a wilderness treatment center for troubled boys. Anneewakee expanded from the single Douglasville, Georgia, center to include a boys campus near Carrabelle, Florida and a girls campus near Rockmart, Georgia. The north campus in Rockmart, Georgia is no longer a girl's campus but a shared campus. One unit which is a locked unit consists of two separate programs aimed at youths with sexual trauma and youths that have committed sexual acts deemed inappropriate in other programs and homes. The second is an extreme bootcamp/outdoors group in which are placed youths who are on the cusp of becoming adult criminals having committed adult crimes. This is a program that seeks to give the youth one last chance to comply with societal norms while receiving treatment. Scandals emerged in the 1980s with decades long history of forced child labor, sexual abuse, physical abuse and deprivation of education. Survivors of this center today range from people who say it saved their lives, to people who refer to it as the Chernobyl of treatment centers. Anneewakee was acquired and is now operated as Inner Harbour Ltd or DBA Inner Harbour for Children & Families. After the scandals, the court awarded the management of the organization to Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) out of Nashville, Tennessee. A medical model was instituted where care is supervised by medical doctors/psychiatrists. In 2015, one of the former patients at the facility wrote a book about his time there. It is the only book written by a former patient. It was Anneewakee: One Boy's Journey, by Steve Salem Evans. Up until 2001 the average stay for a person in the facility could range from ages 5 to adulthood (age 21), giving the center roughly 16 years of a youths life. Those times were changed in 2001 when restructuring of treatment methods began. Now the average stay for a youth is 30 to 90 days. The Douglasville campus is the main campus and is unisex housing girls and boys. The locked unit is composed of four separate units. Each unit named after an Indian tribe such as Abidiban Itanka Kinunka Patchogue ect; The locked unit has a level system red green yellow and blue....each level grants certainly privileges and demands more participation with on site therapists. Each therapist write what is called BURP notes.After a patient has finished the color level system they are moved from locked unit to a campsite. Each camp is categorized by age and sex. Itanka being the teen boys camp.Kinunka being the young girls camp. Tawanka being teen girls camp. Abidiban being older boys camp.

The route runs from Maryland Route 273 (MD 273) at the Maryland border near Newark east to DE 9 and DE 141 in New Castle. The route runs through suburban areas between Newark and New Castle as a multilane road, passing through Ogletown and Christiana. DE 273 intersects DE 896 in downtown Newark; DE 2/DE 72 on the eastern edge of Newark; DE 4 in Ogletown; Interstate 95 (I-95), DE 7, and DE 1 in Christiana; DE 37 in Pleasantville; and DE 58 and U.S. Route 13 (US 13)/US 40 in Hares Corner. What is now DE 273 was originally built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s, with the portion east of Hares Corner becoming a part of US 40, which had crossed the Delaware River on a ferry between New Castle and Pennsville, New Jersey. DE 273 was designated by 1936 to connect the Maryland border near Newark to Hares Corner. In the 1950s, the route was extended to New Castle when US 40 was realigned to the Delaware Memorial Bridge. DE 273 was moved onto new alignments around Christiana in the 1980s and through Ogletown in the 1990s. Route description Westbound DE 273 and northbound DE 896 along West Main Street in Newark approaching South Main Street DE 273 begins at the Maryland border west of the city of Newark, where the road continues west into that state as MD 273\\\\. From the state line, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Nottingham Road, running through wooded suburban neighborhoods as it enters Newark, crossing the Christina River and passing to the south of the Newark Country Club. DE 273 becomes West Main Street as it approaches the downtown area, intersecting the southbound direction of DE 896, at which point DE 273 forms a concurrency with southbound DE 896\\\\. The road crosses CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line at-grade and comes to an intersection with New London Road, which runs northwest as northbound DE 896, and South Main Street, which heads southwest as DE 896. At this point, DE 273 splits into the one-way pair of West Delaware Avenue eastbound and West Main Street westbound, with eastbound DE 273 briefly following one-way South Main Street southwest to get from West Main Street to West Delaware Avenue. The one-way pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, becomes concurrent with DE 896 in both directions until the South College Avenue intersection. DE 273 runs through the University of Delaware campus and continues through the downtown as East Delaware Avenue eastbound and East Main Street westbound. Farther east, the one-way pair crosses the Pomeroy and Newark Rail Trail and passes the Newark Transit Hub serving DART First State buses, which is located between East Main Street and East Delaware Avenue. East Delaware Avenue shifts farther to the south of East Main Street, with the one-way streets passing between a residential neighborhood and East Delaware Avenue passing to the north of Newark High School. Past here, the route comes to an intersection with DE 2/DE 72\\\\. At this point, eastbound DE 273 turns north to join DE 72 on four-lane divided Library Avenue to rejoin westbound DE 273. DE 273 eastbound past DE 2/DE 72 in Newark Past DE 2/DE 72, DE 273 leaves Newark and heads east on Ogletown Road, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes through commercial areas, soon becoming a four-lane divided highway. The route continues east and has an intersection with Ruthar Drive, with an eastbound jughandle for U-turns at the intersection. Past here, the road comes to a bridge over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. The route turns southeast and reaches an interchange with DE 4 and Salem Church Road in Ogletown. Past this interchange, DE 273 becomes Christiana Road and heads east through suburban residential neighborhoods with some businesses. The road bends southeast again as it comes to an interchange with I-95 (Delaware Turnpike). Following this, the route heads into more commercial areas, bypassing the community of Christiana to the southwest. DE 273 runs south through wooded areas and intersects Old Baltimore Pike before crossing the Christina River and curving east, coming to an intersection with DE 7\\\\. A park and ride lot is located at the northeast corner of this intersection. A short distance later, the road reaches a diamond interchange with the DE 1 freeway. Following this interchange, DE 273 heads through woods before entering areas of suburban homes and businesses, coming to a junction with the southern terminus of DE 37 in Pleasantville. The route continues east and intersects the eastern terminus of DE 58 near the Wilmington Airport. A short distance later, the road comes to a junction with US 13/US 40 in Hares Corner. Past this intersection, DE 273 becomes concurrent with DE 9 Truck and turns into two-lane undivided Frenchtown Road, with a multi-use trail parallel to the north. The road heads east between business parks to the south and farm fields to the north. DE 273 comes to an intersection with DE 9 and DE 141 to the west of the city of New Castle, where the route, along with DE 9 Truck, ends. Past the eastern terminus, the road continues east as part of DE 9. Some signage for DE 273, including an end sign at East 6th Street, does still exist east of its formal terminus. The section of DE 273 between Chapman Road and Browns Lane in Christiana is part of the Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route, a National Historic Trail. DE 273 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 49,421 vehicles at the I-95 interchange to a low of 6,924 vehicles at the Hillside Road intersection in Newark. The portion of DE 273 east of DE 896 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 273 eastbound past DE 37 near Christiana What is now DE 273 originally existed as a county road by 1920. Four years later, the portion of road through Newark was upgraded to a state highway while the road was paved between Hares Corner and New Castle. A year later, the section between Ogletown and Christiana was planned as a state highway while the section east of Basin Road was upgraded to a state highway. In 1930, the road between the Maryland border and Newark was built as a state highway, providing a shorter route to the Conowingo Dam in Maryland. The following year, US 40 was designated to run on the portion of road between Hares Corner and New Castle, where it connected to a ferry across the Delaware River to Pennsville, New Jersey. Also by this time, all of present-day DE 273 was upgraded to a state highway except the portion of US 40 between Hares Corner and Basin Road. In 1934, recommendations were made to upgrade US 40 to a state highway between Hares Corner and New Castle. The portion of US 40 between Hares Corner and New Castle was taken over by the state on July 1, 1935. Construction on upgrading this section began in 1936. This project was completed later that year. The same year, a bridge was constructed over a Pennsylvania Railroad line (now the Jack A. Markell Trail) in New Castle. DE 273 was designated to run from the Maryland border west of Newark east to US 13 and US 40 in Hares Corner by 1936, roughly following its current alignment. In Newark, the route ran concurrent with DE 2. By 1952, US 40 was realigned to use the Delaware Memorial Bridge to cross the Delaware River, and DE 273 was extended east along the former alignment of US 40 on Frenchtown Road, Delaware Street, and Ferry Cut Off Street to end at present-day DE 9 at 6th Street in New Castle. In 1956, DE 2 and DE 273 were routed onto the one-way pair of Delaware Avenue eastbound and Main Street westbound in downtown Newark following an eastward extension of Delaware Avenue to the intersection between DE 2 and DE 273 east of the city. By 1984, DE 9 was realigned to follow DE 273 east of the DE 141 intersection. DE 273 was realigned to bypass Christiana a year later, having previously followed Main Street through the community. DE 2 was routed to bypass Newark and DE 2 Bus. became concurrent with DE 273 through Newark by 1990. In 1997, DE 273 was moved to its current alignment in the Ogletown area, eliminating a short concurrency with DE 4 and involving the construction of an interchange with that route. The former alignment of DE 273 through Ogletown is known as Ogletown Road. The concurrent DE 2 Bus. designation was eliminated in 2013 as part of simplifying the route numbers in Newark. By 2015, DE 273 signage was cut back to its current eastern terminus, removing the concurrency with DE 9.

The system developed from a large monsoonal system that persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines. On August 2, a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west- northwestward. Late on August 3, it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of Hong Kong. A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China. The storm made landfall with late on August 4, after reaching peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7. High rainfall from Kammuri affected large portions of China, particularly in Guangdong Province where it moved ashore. In that province, over 100,000 people had to evacuate due to flooding and after 6,810 houses were destroyed. The floods damaged roads, railroads, and tunnels, and left power and water outages across the region. Rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions in Guangdong, although further inland the rains occurred after months of deadly flooding. In Hunan Province, the storm's remnants merged with a cold front, destroying 12,400 houses. Across its path, the floods damaged or destroyed 245,000 houses and destroyed of crop fields. Kammuri caused 153 deaths, most of which were related to the remnants, and damage was estimated at $509 million (¥4.219 billion yuan). Meteorological history The origins of Kammuri are uncertain; they were possibly related to the monsoon trough that moved across the Philippines toward Guam. In late July, a large area of convection persisted in the Philippine Sea, organizing enough for the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Lagalag on August 1\\\\. Around that time, the system had several weak circulations, one of which persisted in the South China Sea; this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear. Early on August 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression to the north of Luzon. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit by initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 17W, and the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) followed suit early on August 3. Initially, it moved generally to the west-northwest, owing to a mid-level ridge over eastern China. The convection became more concentrated, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kammuri late on August 3, to the south of Hong Kong. An upper-level low connected to a trough weakened the ridge over China, allowing Kammuri to move slowly northward. Continued wind shear initially prevented the thunderstorms from being located over the center, although the shear gradually decreased, allowing the convection to organize. Kammuri quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm; the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) at 1800 UTC on August 4. The JTWC estimated the storm was weaker, with 1-minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). At around 2300 UTC on August 4, Kammuri made landfall east of Hong Kong in Guangdong Province, just east of Shanwei. An approaching mid-latitude storm caused it to accelerate over land. Kammuri quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC discontinued advisories at 1200 UTC on August 5. The JMA continued tracking the system until Kammuri dissipated on August 7 over central China. The remnants were absorbed by a cold front. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Tropical Storm Kammuri intensifying in the South China Sea on August 4 On August 3, when Kammuri was located about southeast of Hong Kong, the HKO issued Standby Signal No. 1, the first such signal for a storm that season. By that time, the outer rainbands had begun affecting the region. Kammuri dropped heavy rainfall in Hong Kong that reached in the town of Kwai Chung, most of which fell after the storm passed the region. The rains caused one landslide and damaged one road. Wind gusts in the city reached , and sustained winds of were reported on Waglan Island. There, a storm surge of was also reported. In nearby Macau, outer rainbands delayed airplane flights, and there was some flooding. In Guangdong Province where Kammuri made landfall, rainfall peaked at in Jieyang, and several other stations reported totals of over . The rains caused flash flooding in the province, which destroyed 6,810 houses, leaving thousands homeless. At Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, officials delayed or canceled 56 flights because of the storm. Similarly, Shantou Waisha Airport was closed for four hours, which delayed or canceled 10 flights. Heavy damage was reported in three coastal cities. Two small electrical dams were destroyed by the storm, causing additional flooding. Widespread areas lost power or water, and floods damaged or destroyed roads, tunnels, and large areas of crop lands. The storm killed two people by electrocution in Shantou, and a landslide killed 10 people in Wuhua County. Another landslide disrupted rail traffic between the region and Beijing. About 100,000 people had to evacuate their houses in two cities. There were 27 deaths in the province, and damage was estimated at $109 million (¥904 million yuan). After the storm, provincial officials coordinated the rescue effort for missing people. Despite the destruction, the rainfall from Kammuri helped alleviate drought conditions in the province. However, elsewhere in China, the rainfall occurred after months of heavy rainfall had killed 800 people. Neighboring Fujian Province to Guangdong experienced heavier rainfall, peaking at in Quanzhou. Two stations in the city reported the highest daily total on record. In a six-hour period, a total of was recorded in Pingtan County. Wind gusts reached 79 km/h (49 mph) in Putian, Fujian. The province experienced river flooding due to the heavy rains; the Dazhang Stream crested at in Yongtai County, which was above \\"danger\\" flood levels. Damage in the province totaled $131 million (¥1.085 billion yuan). There were 19 deaths in Fujian. Significant flooding from Kammuri occurred inland, related to the storm's remnants' merging with a cold front. Rainfall reached at a station in Jiangxi Province. In Hunan Province, the storms destroyed 12,400 houses, leaving over 10,000 people homeless. Also in the province, 14 reservoirs surpassed their capacity. A total of 107 people were killed in Hunan, and damage totaled $322 million (¥2.665 billion yuan). Across Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan provinces, floods forced 394,000 people to evacuate, and there were 153 deaths. Overall, 72,000 houses were destroyed and 173,000 sustained damage. In the three provinces, the floods destroyed and damaged of crop fields. After the storm, thousands of soldiers in the People's Liberation Army placed sandbags and maintained dykes along Dongting Lake, and, by the end of August, most floods had receded nationwide. While Kammuri was moving ashore, several ships offshore reported winds of over 74 km/h (40 mph). High rainfall totals spread as far east as Taiwan, where was reported in Taitung County; this was the station's highest daily total. Stations in Okinawa reported rainfall totals as high as . The remnants of Kammuri spread across South Korea with rainfall.

The car is based on the C5 generation of the Chevrolet Corvette sports car, yet is designed purely for motorsports use. It became one of the most successful cars in GT categories, with wins at the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as championships in the American Le Mans Series. The Corvette C5-Rs debuted in 1999 and continues to be raced to this day in vintage racing events, although the C5-R has effectively been replaced by the Corvette C6.R. Development The Corvette C5-R was part of a plan by General Motors and their Chevrolet brand to create a factory team to participate in grand touring races not only in North America, but also elsewhere in the world, most notably at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. GM had previously been against approving factory support for Corvette racing programs, although the IMSA GT Championship's Corvette GTPs had seen some support until they ended competition in 1989. With the fifth generation Corvette however, GM chose to show the performance capabilities of the new car by using a more production- based racing car instead of the \\"in-name-only\\" Corvette GTP. Their intentions were to take on Dodge and Porsche, who were already running in the category at the time. General Motors chose the Pratt & Miller group of Michigan to build and develop the new racing cars, as well as to organize the racing team in preparation for a debut in 1999. Riley & Scott also assisted in the project, running a second team for a year. Since regulations in place at the time limited the team to using elements of production Corvettes, Pratt & Miller and GM used heavily modified road car mules to test out the engine and other equipment that the racing cars were to use. Later, the actual race chassis were built, sharing only basic key structural elements with the road cars. A firewall was placed immediately behind the driver's seat in the cockpit, eliminating any rear visibility inside the car. A large diffuser and wing were added to the rear, while a splitter and vents on the hood were added to the front. The front headlights were also replaced with protruding permanent units in place of the pop-up headlights on the road car. The C5-R initially used a 366 ci (6.0 liter) V8 engine based on the road car's LS1. This was replaced with a larger 427 ci (7.0 liter) engine several months later during the 1999 season, and became the standard engine for the C5-R for the rest of its career. Katech Engine Development constructed the C5-Rs engines, although they retained elements of the production LS1 units. Eleven C5-R chassis were built by Pratt & Miller between 1998 and 2004, with ten being used directly by Corvette Racing and one built purely for privateer use. A twelfth car C5-R frame was built, but served merely as a test mule for the C6.R. =Modifications= As the C5-Rs competed over the years, numerous modifications were carried out in an attempt to improve the C5-R's capabilities against stronger competitors. Among the modifications were changes to the bodywork's aerodynamics in an attempt to increase downforce. The hood design was changed during the 1999 season to replace the small slat vents with a large open gap allowing air to exit more freely from the front grill. The third and fourth chassis built during 2000 were actually different from the initial two, due to being built three inches wider to improve cornering grip. Later modifications included some technology developed on the C6.R, including air conditioning systems for driver comfort and a rear view camera on the bumper and monitor in the cockpit to overcome the lack of a rear window. Racing history =Corvette Racing= With two cars completed, Corvette Racing entered the 1999 24 Hours of Daytona for the United States Road Racing Championship. The Corvette C5-R of Canadian Ron Fellows and Americans Chris Kneifel and John Paul, Jr. managed to finish the endurance event in 18th overall, 34 laps behind the class-winning Porsche. After failures at the 12 Hours of Sebring, Riley & Scott ran a few more rounds of the American Le Mans Series to finish off the year. A lone C5-R finished second in class behind a factory Dodge Viper at Sears Point, and again at Laguna Seca. In 2000, Pratt & Miller took over as the sole Corvette team, once again starting the season at Daytona. The Corvette of Fellows and Kneifel, now joined by Brit Justin Bell, greatly improved on their previous result by finishing in second place overall, a minute behind a factory Viper and easily outperforming various prototypes. However the team was not able to match the performance of the Vipers at Sebring, nor at their debut at Le Mans. The team rebounded though, as they earned their first class victories upon returning to the ALMS. The Corvette team managed to upset the Viper squad at Texas as well as the Petit Le Mans. Even though the C5-Rs ran only a partial season, the team earned third place in the GTS class championship. 2001 once again saw improvement at the opening of the season at Daytona. The C5-Rs outlasted the prototypes in the field and earned themselves the overall race victory. The race also saw the first drives by Dale Earnhardt and Earnhardt, Jr. in both the 24 Hours and the Corvette C5-R, with their car finishing fourth overall. Feeling that the C5-R was a capable winner anywhere, Pratt & Miller ran their first full season of the ALMS and earned six class victories, including their second at the Petit Le Mans. The C5-R also took its first victory at Le Mans, finishing eighth overall and 34 laps ahead of the closest competitor in their class. Corvette Racing did not return to the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2002 due to rule changes in that event's championship, but they did continue their run in the American Le Mans Series. Corvette won nine out of the ten events, including their first class victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Their only loss came to the new Prodrive Ferrari team. Corvette secured their second win at Le Mans in 2002 as well. 2003 saw the first challenge to Corvette Racing's two years of dominance in their class. Prodrive chose to enter their Ferrari 550 GTS' in the full ALMS season as well, and although they were not strong early in the season, they managed to win the last four events of the season, including Petit Le Mans. Corvette Racing was however able to secure their third championship by a mere four points over the Prodrive team. The Ferraris would strike another blow though as they managed to end Corvette Racing's Le Mans streak, an event in which Corvette Racing celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Corvette. Prodrive did not return to the American Le Mans Series for 2004, allowing Corvette to sweep the entire season and earn their fourth straight championship. Although Prodrive did compete at Le Mans, Corvette Racing was able to avenge their loss and add their third class victory at the event. This season was the final one for the C5-R under the Corvette Racing banner. The development of the C6 generation Corvette for 2005 led to an all- new race car, termed the Corvette C6.R, which the factory team used at the beginning of the 2005 season. In total, Corvette Racing's C5-Rs would earn 31 class victories in the American Le Mans Series, three class wins at Le Mans, and one overall victory at Daytona. =Privateer teams= Initially, Corvette C5-Rs were built exclusively for the factory Corvette Racing team. It was not until 2001 that Pratt & Miller would enter discussions with teams looking to purchase their own C5-Rs. The British Atomic Kitten Racing squad initially planned to purchase two brand new cars in 2001, but were unable to come to a deal. It was not until 2003 that the first C5-R was sold to an outside team. Selleslagh Racing Team The first C5-R customer was Belgian Patrick Selleslagh, who ran the Selleslagh Racing Team (SRT) in the Belcar championship. The car earned a season's best finish of second place at one of the series' events at Spa. The team also entered the Spa 24 Hours later that year as part of the FIA GT Championship, and managed to finish in 18th place overall. 2004 saw a similar result, with a best finish of second once again at a Spa round, as well as a couple of thirds. 2005 however would see the car take control of the Belcar series, as SRT won the opening round at Zolder. SRT went on to win four more events that season, including the 24 Hours of Zolder, and won the overall BelCar championship. An eighth place was also earned at the Spa 24 Hours. At the end of 2005, SRT bought a former factory C5-R to complement their existing car. Both entered in the French FFSA GT Championship the next season. SRT managed a season best of second at Nogaro. 2007 saw only one C5-R entered in FFSA GT, earning five third-place finishes. The team's second C5-R would run in the FIA GT Championship's Citation Cup for amateur drivers, winning three races for that category, as well as finishing tenth overall at the Spa 24 Hours. Pacific Coast Motorsports American Tom Figge purchased the second customer C5-R in 2004, although this chassis was not a new car but instead a former factory car. Plans were made to use the car in the 2005 American Le Mans Series season for his Pacific Coast Motorsports squad. Although they were not expected to compete with the factory Corvette Racing team, they struggled against other privateers like ACEMCO Motorsports' Saleen S7-R. The team finished on their class podium only once in seven races before eventually deciding to abandon the series. GLPK-Carsport For the Corvette C5-R's first full entry in the FIA GT Championship, the Belgian- Dutch GLPK-Carsport team purchased another former factory chassis. The team earned two victories in their debut season, at Imola and Zhuhai, as well as a fourth-place finish at the Spa 24 Hours, although this result was later taken away due to disqualification. The two victories aided the team in finishing the season fourth in the teams championship, the highest placed team running only a one car entry. For 2006, the team chose to move to the Belcar series while their brand new C6.R concentrated on FIA GT. The team won on their debut to the series. In 2007, the Dutch Carsport Holland half of the team separated, leaving PK-Carsport to continue on their own with the C5-R, choosing to return to FIA GT. The team had one of their best finish of the season at the Spa 24 Hours, once again finishing in third place but only three laps behind the winners. PSI Experience Following the departure of Pacific Coast Motorsports from the American Le Mans Series, their car was offered for sale. The Belgian PSI Experience team purchased this car as well as a C6.R for use in 2006, entering both in the FFSA GT Championship. The team's C5-R earned a victory at Lédenon, with French singer David Hallyday part of the driving squad. PSI also entered the Spa 24 Hours, finishing in eleventh overall. PSI remained in FFSA GT for 2007, once again earning a race victory, this time at Nogaro. The C5-R was also entered in a few rounds of the FIA GT Championship as part of the Citation Cup. Luc Alphand Aventures One of the last C5-Rs sold, an ex-factory chassis was bought by French Olympian Luc Alphand for use in the Le Mans Series in 2006. The car earned two second-place finishes and a third in the five race season, enough to finish third in the championship standings. The team also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing third in class behind a factory Corvette C6.R and Aston Martin DBR9. 2007 brought a new C6.R to the team, and both cars were campaigned in the Le Mans Series, but added the FFSA GT Championship to their season. Three second- place finishes were earned in FFSA GT, while the Le Mans Series entries earned only two third-place finishes. The car was entered at Le Mans, finishing 24th.

He is best known for creating a highly influential 'four level' model for training course evaluation, which served as the subject of his Ph.D. dissertation in 1954. Kirkpatrick's ideas were published to a broader audience in 1959 in a series of articles in the US Training and Development Journal, but they are better known from a book he published in 1994 entitled Evaluating Training Programs. Other books that he has written on training evaluation include Transferring Learning to Behavior and Implementing the Four Levels. Four Levels of Learning Evaluation Kirkpatrick's four levels are designed as a sequence of ways to evaluate training programs. Many practitioners believe that as you proceed through each of the levels, the evaluation becomes more difficult and requires more time. Clomedia.com Editor suggests \\"it is best to look at the levels as a categorization scheme (i.e., their original purpose) in order to guide your staff in what levels to apply to the evaluation task\\".Evaluation as a Strategic Tool Clomedia.com Editor - 5/17/04 In practice, then, it is common for trainers to get stuck in Levels 1 and 2 and never proceed to Levels 3 and 4, where the most useful data exist. Today, Kirkpatrick-certified facilitators stress \\"starting with the end in mind,\\" essentially beginning with Level 4 and moving backward in order to better establish the desired outcome before ever planning the training program.Ed Forest: Kirkpatrick Model: Four Levels of Learning Evaluation, Educational Technology When done strategically, reaching these levels does not have to be any more expensive or time consuming, but will still help to ensure on-the-job performance of learned behaviors and skills. The four levels of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model are as follows: # Reaction - The degree to which participants find the training favorable, engaging and relevant to their jobs # Learning - The degree to which participants acquire the intended knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and commitment based on their participation in the training # Behavior - The degree to which participants apply what they learned during training when they are back on the job # Results - The degree to which targeted outcomes occur as a result of the training and the support and accountability package Several authors have suggested an addition of a fifth level of evaluation. JJ Phillips has argued for the addition of a Return on Investment (ROI) level, which is essentially about comparing the fourth level of the standard model to the overall costs of training.Phillips, J. (1996). How much is the training worth? Training and Development, 50(4),20-24. Roger Kaufman has argued that ROI is essentially a Level 4 type of evaluation because it is still internal to the organization and that a fifth level of evaluation should focus on the impact of the organization on external clients and society.Watkins, R., Leigh, D., Foshay, R. and Kaufman, R.

Coburn (born 1944 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States) is an American entrepreneur, former New Hampshire state representative, and the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor of New Hampshire. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but moved to Chester, New Hampshire when he was seven years old to live with his grandmother after his mother died of cancer.. Background Coburn graduated from Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire, and worked in a shoe factory before joining the United States Air Force. He was stationed in West Germany, serving as the crew chief of a special weapons maintenance team. It was there that he met his wife, Christa. Settling in Chester with his wife, after leaving the service, he worked for Digital Equipment Corporation for 21 years. In 1994, he and a partner left Digital to start Valco Data Systems, which makes software to archive medical records. Coburn’s wife died in 2004 after a lengthy battle with multiple sclerosis. When she was diagnosed, he promised her that he would not put her in a nursing home or let her become bedridden. He also promised he would not enter politics as long as she lived. He has said her experience has helped make health-care reform one of his top political priorities. Political career =New Hampshire House of Representatives (2004-2006)= Soon after his wife's death, Coburn sold his share of Valco to his partner and entered politics. He won a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2004 representing Windham. His voting record as a state representative has reflected a conservative position on taxes, abortion and opposition to gay marriage. =Running for Governor (2006)= In March, 2006, he hired the Manchester firm Meridian Communications to handle his upcoming gubernatorial campaign, and on June 14, 2006, filed his candidacy for governor at the statehouse in Concord. He is a member of the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of New Hampshire, Pelham Fish & Game Club, and the New Hampshire Historical Society. On May 30, 2006 in the Concord Monitor, he stated his support for a gas tax as part of a comprehensive State energy plan promoting diesel and other, more efficient, fuel sources for motor vehicles Edited for accuracy and completeness.Eric Moskowitz, McCain: Higher gas taxes will not translate to the U.S., Concord Monitor, May 30, 2006. Coburn was an underdog against Democratic incumbent, John Lynch, who in 2006 one of the most popular governors in the country. Results of the 2006 New Hampshire elections showed Lynch defeating Coburn by a landslide.Election 2006 Results. Coburn has two children and three grandchildren. There was some speculation that Coburn might seek the Republican nomination for New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district to challenge incumbent Democrat Paul Hodes, but he did not, eventually endorsing Jennifer Horn for the position.Jennifer Horn announces endorsement .

It is also the only game in the series to allow users to purchase power-up items such as \\"beef\\" (for boosting the offensive line) and \\"go juice\\" (for a second wind on long gains) from a \\"sideline shop\\" during the game. Screenshot of All American Football The game did not have licenses from the NFL, NFLPA or the NCAA. Because of this, pro teams were only referred to by city (Green Bay, Pittsburgh, etc.), state (Minnesota) or region (New England). Most of the college teams featured were ones with names that were based geographically (Michigan, Wisconsin, etc.) or militaristic (Army and Navy). This feature was purely cosmetic as the teams all played the same regardless of which one was chosen. It also allowed users to choose their own team colors no matter which team they chose. Like its predecessors, All- American Football involved the use of a \\"spring stick,\\" which required players to aim passes and kicks, making for more realistic gameplay. Series *1.

Their existence divides the philosophical school of physicalism from the schools of idealism and dualism; with the latter schools holding that they can exist and the former holding that they cannot. If one posits that non-physical entities can exist, there exist further debates as to their inherent natures and their position relative to physical entities. Abstract concepts Philosophers generally do agree on the existence of abstract objects. These include concepts such as numbers, mathematical sets and functions, and philosophical relations and properties. Such entities are not physical inasmuch as they exist outside space and time. An abstract property such as redness also has no location in space-time. There are two concepts one being abstract and the other being concrete. The reason why these concepts are put into two separate categories is to make a distinction between metaphysics and epistemology. While older Cartesian dualists held the existence of non-physical minds, more limited forms of dualism propounded by 20th and 21st century philosophers (such as property dualism) hold merely the existence of non-physical properties. =Experimental Evidence Indicative of Non-Physical Minds= The 2012 Physics Essays Publication contains a study conducted by six academics with various backgrounds. It revealed that trained meditators with focused minds can have effects on quantum objects in a double-slit experiment, lending weight and credibility to the ‘consciousness causes wave-function collapse’ model of Quantum Mechanics. > “Variables including temperature, vibration, and signal drift were also > tested, and no spurious influences were identified. By contrast, factors > associated with consciousness, such as meditation experience, > electrocortical markers of focused attention, and psychological factors > including openness and absorption, significantly correlated in predicted > ways with perturbations in the double-slit interference pattern. The results > appear to be consistent with a consciousness-related interpretation of the > quantum measurement problem.” Slime Mold If minds are fundamentally non-physical and non-local, we might expect that organisms without a central nervous system would show cognitive behaviors. Slime mold has no central nervous system, but has been shown in a laboratory environment to displays cognitive behaviors: “These results strongly suggest that, like humans, Physarum doesn’t attach any intrinsic value to the options that are available to it. Instead, it compares its alternatives.” > \\"What that means, according to Dussutour [...] is that a slime mold can > learn — and it can keep that knowledge during dormancy, despite the > extensive physical and biochemical changes in the cells that accompany that > transformation. Being able to remember where to find food is a useful skill > for a slime mold to have in the wild, because its environment can be > treacherous. [...] More fundamentally, she said, this result also means that > there is such a thing as ‘primitive cognition,’ a form of cognition that is > not restricted to organisms with a brain.” Single Celled Life We might expect that is mind is fundamentally non- physical and non-local, that even organisms as small as single cells might have cognitive behaviors without relying on complex brain structures or even a central nervous system. =Physarum polycephalum= “For the first time, scientists have demonstrated that an organism devoid of a nervous system is capable of learning. A team from the Centre de Recherches sur la Cognition Animale (CNRS/Université Toulouse III -- Paul Sabatier) has succeeded in showing that a single-celled organism, the protist Physarum polycephalum, is capable of a type of learning called habituation. This discovery throws light on the origins of learning ability during evolution, even before the appearance of a nervous system and brain.” =Amoeba Proteus= “Associative memory is the main type of learning by which complex organisms endowed with evolved nervous systems respond efficiently to certain environmental stimuli. It has been found in different multicellular species, from cephalopods to humans, but never in individual cells. Here we describe a motility pattern consistent with associative conditioned behavior in the microorganism Amoeba proteus.” Past Life Memory Research We might expect that if minds are non-physical and non-local, that they could come (or should come) from somewhere else before birth rather than arising in the womb for the first time. Research has been done on this topic. =Dr. Ian Stevenson & Past Life Memories= “Stevenson, an expert on psychosomatic medicine, suspected strong emotions are related to a child’s retention of past-life memories. Traumatic deaths, he thought, leave an emotional imprint. Indeed, most of the children he studied claimed that they had met a violent end previously. There was also a gap of a few years between lives; reincarnation is never immediate. And for the most part, souls seemed to stay local. That's to say, the ‘previous personality’ often lived in a distant village, but not quite so far away as to require a passport.” =Dr. Jim Tucker & Past Life Memories in North America= \\"For the past 20 years, Dr. Jim Tucker, now the director of the Division of Perceptual Studies, has focused mainly on cases found in the United States. His most recent book Return to Life offers accounts of very strong American cases of young children who remember previous lives. In this book, Dr. Tucker writes about the now well-known cases of James Leininger, a young boy who had verifiable past-life memories of being a WWII pilot, and Ryan Hammond, who had verifiable memories of being a Hollywood extra and talent agent.” Dr. Parnia's Research We might expect that if minds are non-physical and non-local, that they could acquire knowledge non-physically and non-locally when the brain has completely shut off and has no access to the five senses. Dr. Parnia & Patients with no brain activity: “Conscious awareness appears to have continued for up to three minutes into the period when the heart wasn’t beating, even though the brain typically shuts down within 20-30 seconds after the heart has stopped. This is significant since it has often been assumed that experiences in relation to death are likely hallucinations or illusions, occurring either before the heart stops or after the heart has been successfully restarted, but not an experience corresponding with ‘real’ events when the heart isn’t beating. Furthermore, the detailed recollections of visual awareness in this case were consistent with verified events.” Dr. Bruce Greyson's Research “There are four lines of evidence to explore [which support the mind being non- physical]. Number one is the unexplained recovery of consciousness for people who’ve been unconscious for prolonged periods of time moments or days before their death. Number two is a complex consciousness in people with minimal brain tissue. Number three is surprisingly complex consciousness in near-death experiencers when the brain is not functioning or functions at a diminished level, and number four; young children who recall details of a past life.” Prof. Daryl Bem’s Psi Research We might expect that if minds are non- physical and non-local, that they could acquire knowledge non-physically and non-locally, under certain conditions. “All but one of the nine experiments confirmed the hypothesis that psi exists. The odds against the combined results being due to chance or statistical flukes are about 74 billion to 1, according to Bem.”  Mind–body dualism  Dualism is the division of two contrasted or opposed aspects. The dualist school supposes the existence of non-physical entities, the most widely discussed one being the mind. But beyond that it runs into stumbling blocks. Pierre Gassendi put one such problem directly to René Descartes in 1641, in response to Descartes's Meditations: Descartes' response to Gassendi, and to Princess Elizabeth who asked him similar questions in 1643, is generally considered nowadays to be lacking, because it did not address what is known in the philosophy of mind as the interaction problem. This is a problem for non-physical entities as posited by dualism: by what mechanism, exactly, do they interact with physical entities, and how can they do so? Interaction with physical systems requires physical properties which a non-physical entity does not possess. Dualists either, like Descartes, avoid the problem by considering it impossible for a non-physical mind to conceive the relationship that it has with the physical, and so impossible to explain philosophically, or assert that the questioner has made the fundamental mistake of thinking that the distinction between the physical and the non-physical is such that it prevents each from affecting the other. Other questions about the non-physical which dualism has not answered include such questions as how many minds each person can have, which is not an issue for physicalism which can simply declare one-mind-per-person almost by definition; and whether non-physical entities such as minds and souls are simple or compound, and if the latter, what \\"stuff\\" the compounds are made from.  Spirits  Describing in philosophical terms what a non-physical entity actually is (or would be) can prove problematic. A convenient example of what constitutes a non-physical entity is a ghost. Gilbert Ryle once labelled Cartesian Dualism as positing the \\"ghost in the machine\\". However, it is hard to define in philosophical terms what it is, precisely, about a ghost that makes it a specifically non-physical, rather than a physical entity. Were the existence of ghosts ever demonstrated beyond doubt, it has been claimed that would actually place them in the category of physical entities. Purported non-mental non-physical entities include things such as gods, angels, demons, and ghosts. Lacking demonstrations of their existence, their existences and natures are widely debated, independently of the philosophy of mind.

In 1906, he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, and the next year he played at right field and hit seven home runs. During the season, Murray hit a home run. In 1908, he played in all 154 games and finished second in the National League in stolen bases (48), and third both in hits (167) and home runs (7). Murray was traded to the New York Giants and helped win John McGraw three consecutive pennants. From 1909 to 1912, he ranked third in the league in runs batted in, trailing only Honus Wagner and Sherry Magee.

It, along with its congener, are the only members of the genus Drepanornis. Conservation status Widespread throughout its large range, the black-billed sicklebill is evaluated as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Etymology The generic name Drepanornis consists of the words Drepane for \\"sickle\\" and ornis for \\"bird\\", so the genus name literally means \\"sickle bird\\", referring to their sickle-shaped bill; the specific name commemorates the Italian naturalist Luigi Maria d'Albertis, who discovered this species in 1872. The race cervinicauda subspecific name consists of cervinus for \\"stag-colored\\" and \\"cauda\\" for tail, geisleri honors Bruno Geisler, a German ornithologist who described this subspecies, and inversus means \\"overturned\\". Subspecies and taxonomy Though they share similar features and the same English name, the Drepanornis sicklebills are only distantly related to the Epimachus sicklebills. In fact, they are more closely allied with the twelve-wired and standardwing birds-of-paradise. There are two agreeable subspecies, though races geisleri from the Huon Peninsula and inversus from the Weyland mountains and nearby highlands require more detail to be considered valid subspecies or not. *Drepanornis albertisi albertisi (Sclater, 1873) *Drepanornis albertisi cervinicauda (Sclater, 1884) Drepanornis albertisi cervinicauda, museum specimen Description The black- billed sicklebill is medium-sized, about 35 cm long, brown. The male has a bare maroon-grey skin around its eye, buff-colored tail, dark-brown iris, yellow mouth and black sickle-like bill. It is adorned with dark, horn-like forecrown feathers, an erectile fan-like bronze neck plumes and elongated purple-tipped flank plumes. The unadorned brown female is smaller, with bill longer than male and dark-barred below. Biology Its diet consists mainly of fruit and arthropods. The female lays one to two pale cream eggs with brown and grey spots. Distribution The black-billed sicklebill is found in mountainous areas in western, central, and eastern New Guinea. The species is mostly distributed in tropical montane forests at altitudes of 1100 to 1900 m above sea level. It overlaps with Drepanornis brujini only barely, but no hybridization has ever been recorded, though it is possible to occur.

It is generally featured as an element of the legend of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. There are many variations to the story, but it generally includes these details: During the 1840s, the Peralta family of northern Mexico supposedly developed rich gold mine(s) in the Superstition Mountains. In 1848, during a routine expedition to carry gold back to Mexico, the large party was ambushed by Apaches, and all were killed except for a few Peralta family members who escaped. According to the legend, the Apaches buried and hid the gold and covered up the mine. However, according to historian Robert Blair, the Peralta massacre never occurred; see the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine for a more detailed explanation. The author T.E. Glover in his book, The Lost Dutchman Mine of Jacob Waltz, wrote of a U.S. Cavalry trooper named William Edwards who was present for the discovery of the deceased remains. The Cavalry leaders assumed that these were bodies from an Indian battle between fighting tribes. But trooper Edwards noticed that at least one of the skulls had a gold filing, common to Mexican (Spanish) aristocracy. He returned at a later date, and found even more human remains further up the canyon. It is reported that he, and then later his son, spent much of their lives searching for the lost mine. The Peralta massacre is depicted in a flashback in the 1949 film Lust for Gold, starring Glenn Ford and Ida Lupino.

Dwight Price (born ) was principal from 1972-87. After its comprehensive 1998 building renovation, Lafayette implemented block scheduling beginning with the 2000–01 academic year. In 2012, the school received its eighth principal: Memphis, Tennessee-native and University of Kentucky graduate Bryne Jacobs (born ). Jacobs previously worked at Lexington's Paul Laurence Dunbar High School from 2000-12, and was still at Lafayette through at least the 2017–18 academic year. Renovation of the school's stadium was completed in 2010. Part of the Fayette County Public Schools school district, Lafayette had 2271 enrolled students across grades 9–12 in the 2018–19 academic year (628 freshmen, 604 sophomores, 548 juniors, and 489 seniors). With 118.00 full-time equivalent teachers, the student-to- teacher ratio was 19.25:1. Of the student body, 0.00% were Native American, 5.55% were Asian, 11.89% were Black, 10.79% were Hispanic, 0.09% were Pacific Islanders, 68.34% were White, and 3.35% were multiracial. Academics Lafayette's northwest wing As of the 2017–18 academic year, Lafayette offered two specialized programs for its students: the School for the Creative and Performing Arts (SCAPA) and the Pre-Engineering Program. SCAPA was \\"designed for students who excel in art, ballet, band, contemporary dance, creative writing, drama, piano, strings, and voice\\", and required an audition to be considered for the program. The latter offering was a program \\"designed to provide students with the skills needed to succeed in such mathematically rigorous and technical fields as engineering, architecture, medicine, computer programming, mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics.\\" Extracurriculars The Lafayette boys' basketball team won the Sweet Sixteen championship in 1942, 1950, 1953, 1957, 1979, and 2001. The baseball team won the state championship in 1988, 1989, and 1992. The Lafayette marching band was awarded The Sudler Shield by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in 1991 and 1998.

Two families escaping from the Mexican Revolution to the relative safety of the United States have parallel experiences centered on their mothers' strength. It is available in Spanish as Lluvia de Oro.Lluvia de Oro:  Chapter summaries  =Prologue= El Rio Urique Espirito (a Mexican Indian) \\"...followed a doe and her fawn in search for water\\"Villaseñor, Victor Edmundo. Rain of Gold (New York: Dell, 1991), p. 7. because the spring in his tribe's land had dried up. He eventually discovers a hidden spring. Some time after, a particularly harsh winter forced Espirito to go in search for food and supplies for his tribe. He eventually finds a store in a settlement near the Urique River. Espirito wanders into the store and talks to the store owner, Don Carlos Barrios, and wants to trade the water of the spring which he found for food and supplies. However, Don Carlos laughs at the idea, because the store is in a desert next to a river. Don Carlos asks Espirito if he has anything else to trade, but Espirito with great disappointment replies \\"All I have are these little stones and this ground water\\". Don Carlos does a double take and notices that those \\"little stones\\" are in fact gold nuggets, he then desperately chases down Espirito who was already headed out the door. Espirito is pleasantly surprised that Don Carlos suddenly wants to trade food and supplies for all his stones (golden nuggets). Espirito quickly trades, because he thinks that Don Carlos has lost it but might change his mind - Espirito does not know he has gold nuggets and assumes that they are nothing more than interesting looking and worthless stones. =First chapter= The novel begins with the main character, Lupe Gomez, who lives with her mother, Doña Guadalupe, and her other sisters and brother in a ramada in the \\"Rain of Gold\\" valley. The family makes a living by selling breakfast to the local miners and washing their clothes. There is a group of colorful miners and most of them have problems with drinking and gambling. The village suffers repeated raids by various factions of the Mexican Revolution and ultimately the brazen Doña Guadalupe manages to protect her daughters and son. Eventually Lupe encounters a man named Colonel Manuel Maytorena, she simply calls \\"my colonel\\", a charismatic and romantic figure that Lupe seemingly falls in love with. For much of the beginning of the first chapter of the story she compares the things she enjoys in life to the Colonel, despite the fact that he is married to another woman and is nearly two decades older than she is. Swayed by the religious devotion of the Gomez family, the Colonel has them look after his young wife, Socorro, who is pregnant. While away on an escort mission to ship gold north to the United States, the Colonel is attacked and killed. Subsequently, the rebel fighters who slayed him return to the box canyon where Lupe lives and dominate the residents. They are a suspicious group and accuse Lupe's brother Victoriano of stealing gold from the mine and they try to hang him as an example to others. He is saved by his mother, who hands him a gun after she tells the rebels that she wants to give Victoriano his last prayer, but before Victoriano is able to escape, he shoots and kills La Liebre, the leader of the soldiers, who was attempting to kill Doña Guadalupe. Afterwards, La Liebre's second in command orders Doña Guadalupe to be hanged, but is stopped by the town's people gathering in a mob to stop them. Shortly after the violence the towns people start to leave the city en masse to escape the violence of the Mexican revolution. Publication history Villaseñor took twelve years to research the material for the book, but when the original publisher asked him to shorten it, change the title, and market it as fiction, he bought back the rights, using his mother's life savings and a new mortgage to do so.Martinez Wood, Jamie. \\"Villaseñor, Victor.\\" Latino Writers and Journalists.

It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the universe prior to the arising of the concept of \\"Mind\\", a term that more appropriately refers to the organic, human, aspect of universal consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions. Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur. Universal consciousness is the source, ground, basis, that underlies those interactions and the awareness and knowledge they imply. Introduction The concept of universal mind was presented by Anaxagoras, a Pre-Socratic philosopher who arrived in Athens some time after 480 BC. He taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from surrounding substances. For this concept of mind, Anaxagoras was commended by Aristotle. Both Plato and Aristotle, however, objected that his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically, i.e. acts for the “best interests” of the universe.[1] The most original aspect of Anaxagoras's system was his doctrine of nous (\\"mind\\" or \\"reason\\"). [2] A different Greek word, gnó̱si̱ (awareness), better reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic being than just the human world. A worm, an amoeba, a bacteria, a raindrop, appears to act with \\"awareness\\" (gnó̱si̱) rather than \\"reason\\" (nous). Also, these actions would not commonly be referred to as being \\"reasonable\\" or \\"ethical\\". In \\"The Huang Po Doctrine of Universal Mind\\", originated in around 857 CE, the idea of mind was disconnected from soul in this Buddhist school of thought. Chu Ch’an says, “Universal mind, therefore, is something to which nothing can be attributed. Being absolute, it is beyond attributes. If for example, it were to be described as infinite, that would exclude from it whatever is finite, but the whole argument of the book is that universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend through our senses, is nothing else but this mind. Even to think of it in terms of existence or non-existence is to misapprehend it entirely.” pp. 8–9 [3] The term surfaced again in later philosophy, as in the writings of Hegel. - Hegel writes: Descriptions There are no definitions of the Universal Mind, but two authors within the New Thought movement offer vague descriptions in superlatives such as omnipotence and infinitude. Ernest Holmes, the founder of the Science of Mind movement: New Thought author Charles Haanel said of the universal mind and its relationship to humans: The nature of the universal mind is said to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. Psychological interpretation Universal mind may be viewed from a scientific perspective as non-local consciousness. Michael Persinger wrote on non-local consciousness: The atemporal nature of consciousness is explored by Mansoor Malik and Maria Hipolito. They summarise key theorists on the subject from different ontological perspectives: A research team in Australia conducted more than 20,000 experiments of universal mind and concluded: \\"Overwhelming evidence is pointing to the existence of 'supernatural' reality and a universal subconscious mind ( aka 'God' ): Many religious concepts are essentially a science of mind.\\" See also * Panpsychism References Sources * Anaxagoras.

Theatrically released with Superior Duck as the preceding cartoon. As of March 20, 2019, the film rights to Carpool are owned by the Walt Disney Studios through 20th Century Fox, which had obtained the film rights from Warner Bros. in the mid-2010s. Plot Workaholic Daniel Miller (David Paymer) is forced to drive his family carpool when his wife (Stellina Rusich) becomes ill. Daniel is in the middle of a huge advertising campaign for Hammerman's, a large chain of delis, and initially refuses the carpool until his wife guilts him into it. It includes his two sons, Andrew (Mikey Kovar) and Bucky (Micah Gardener), two local ladies; Chelsea (Colleen Rennison) and her older sister, Kayla (Rachael Leigh Cook), and local weirdo Travis (Jordan Warkol). Meanwhile, Franklin Laszlo (Tom Arnold) is the owner of a failing carnival. Franklin has the bright idea to rob a bank in order to get the money to keep his business going. As he leaves to attempt his bank robbery, Franklin enters a local Hammerman's where Daniel is also at. Inside, two gunmen hold it up and eventually a standoff ensues between them, an older woman, Franklin, and a local detective, Lt. Erdman (Kim Coates). Through a series of misunderstandings, Franklin takes Daniel hostage and has Hammerman's money that the gunmen had stolen from the deli. Heading to the van, Franklin kidnaps Daniel and the children. The group bonds through a series of misadventures; stopping at a hair salon to use the bathroom, evading the police using a disguise, and eventually being chased by an obsessed meter maid, Martha (Rhea Perlman). Franklin reveals to the group the reason behind his robbery and kidnapping: keeping the carnival open so he can see his son. Eventually, Franklin takes the group to his carnival, where the children enjoy the rides. The two gunmen have tracked Franklin through his wallet, which he had dropped in the deli, and want Hammerman's money. A fight ensues, with the controls to the Ferris Wheel being damaged. Daniel uses his advertising materials to jam the mechanism of ride and climbs up to rescue Andrew. Franklin ties up the gunmen, locks them into the Zipper and gets his wallet back, but Daniel presses the button, and the gunmen enjoy the rides. Daniel realizes it's too late to attend his pitch meeting, but Franklin convinces him otherwise. Daniel arrives late and unprepared but successfully pitches to Mr. Hammerman (Rod Steiger) that children don't like his chain and that a revamp to something more kid-friendly would help. Franklin likes the idea, and Daniel gains the backbone to tell him he quits. Eventually the police arrive, but Daniel does not wish to press charges, and Franklin is let off the hook. Sometime later, Franklin and Daniel are co-owners of the carnival, with Mr. Hammerman supplying them with food. Everything seems to be okay, until Franklin realizes he missed a lunch date with his mother, who is shown destroying a local Sizzler over the closing credits.

At the end of its run, it had grossed $3,325,651. Based on an estimated $17 million budget, it was a box office bomb. =Critical response= The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 13% score based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 2.6/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 15 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Ty Burr for Entertainment Weekly calls the film \\"Hard to hate, but just about impossible to like\\" and gives it grade D+. Variety called it: \\"Low-tech, high-volume slapstick, \\"Carpool\\" is a ramshackle if amiable chase comedy that should have some appeal for end-of-summer family outings.\\" Janet Maslin, of The New York Times, pointed out that the supporting characters, especially Rhea Perlman, end up standing out with more pleasant moments when compared to the performance of Tom Arnold. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post, emphasizes that in contrast to the character of Daniel who discovers that life should be fun, the film is not the same for the viewer. =Accolades= Arnold tied with Pauly Shore for a 1996 Razzie Award in part for his role in the film as well as for Big Bully and The Stupids. He also won Worst Actor for the same movies at the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards; said movies were also dishonourable mentions for Worst Picture.

It is owned by Port Huron Family Radio and broadcasts with a power of 3,000 watts. WGRT signed on in October 1991. The station airs a satellite-delivered AC format (\\"Today's Hits and Yesterday's Favorites\\") from Citadel Media. The station can be heard as far as Lapeer County and in parts of northern Macomb and southern Sanilac counties. The station is also heard as far east as Strathroy, Ontario; however, reception in the Canadian portion of WGRT's listening area, as well as areas closer to Detroit and Windsor, may be compromised, following the approval by the CRTC to upgrade the broadcast power of CHST-FM in London, Ontario ( east of Port Huron), increasing its maximum ERP from 12,100 to 100,000 watts;Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-127 and the sign-on of CINA-FM in Windsor in 2012.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-490, CHST-FM London – Technical change, CRTC, September 12, 2012 Like WGRT, CHST-FM and CINA-FM both also broadcast on 102.3 FM. History The groundwork for WGRT can be traced back to 1983, when the FCC first \\"dropped in\\" an FM license to Port Huron that year. As the local area prospered, it became evident that St. Clair County and the surrounding area could support another local radio station in addition to the five already on the air serving the local community. Port Huron Family Radio, headed by local pastor Marty Doorn, acquired the license after a lengthy set of competitive hearings from Hanson Communications, licensee of AM competitor WPHM. Hanson Communications ultimately did not prevail and went on to acquire WBTI in Lexington. The new WGRT 102.3 FM was finally granted permission by the FCC to go on the air in 1991. For a Class A station, WGRT had an unusually powerful signal, reaching more than 40 miles in each direction, and into the Detroit Metropolitan Area's fringes. WGRT went on the air using ABC/SMN's \\"Starstation\\" adult contemporary format (now called ABC AC), originating out of Chicago with DJ's Don Sainte- Johnn, Richard Steele, Sonny Taylor, etc. (later Dallas), thus eliminating the expense for a full-time local contingency of on-air personalities, though the station employs a full-time news director actively involved in the community. Following the sale of the five competing stations in Port Huron (WSAQ, WHLS, WHLX, WPHM, WBTI) by the end of the 20th Century, WGRT earned the distinction of being St. Clair County's sole locally owned and operated commercial radio station. (The other locally owned stations in the market - WNFA, WNFR, WRSX, and WORW - are non-commercial and feature either religious or student programming.)

Biography Küpfmüller was born in Nuremberg, where he studied at the Ohm-Polytechnikum. After returning from military service in World War I, he worked at the telegraph research division of the German Post in Berlin as a co-worker of Karl Willy Wagner, and, from 1921, he was lead engineer at the central laboratory of Siemens & Halske AG in the same city. In 1928 he became full professor of general and theoretical electrical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Danzig, and later held the same position in Berlin. Küpfmüller joined the National Socialist Motor Corps in 1933. In the following year he also joined the SA. In 1937 Küpfmüller joined the NSDAP and became a member of the SS, where he reached the rank of Obersturmbannführer.Prof. Helmut Maier: Forschung als Waffe. Rüstungsforschung in der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft und das Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Metallforschung 1900-1945/48. Wallstein Verlag, Göttingen 2007, , p. 710. Küpfmüller was appointed as director of communication technology Research & Development at the Siemens-Wernerwerk for telegraphy. In 1941–1945 he was director of the central R&D; division at Siemens & Halske in 1937. From 1952 until his retirement in 1963, he held the chair for general communications engineering at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. Later he was honorary professor at the Technische Hochschule Berlin. In 1968, he received the Werner von Siemens Ring for his contributions to the theory of telecommunications and other electro-technology. He died at Darmstadt. Studies in communication theory About 1928, he did the same analysis that Harry Nyquist did, to show that not more than 2B independent pulses per second could be put through a channel of bandwidth B. He did this by quantifying the time-bandwidth product k of various communication signal types, and showing that k could never be less than 1/2.K.

(German) On the dynamics of automatic gain controllers, (English translation) From his 1931 paper (rough translation from Swedish):Karl Küpfmüller, \\"Utjämningsförlopp inom Telegraf- och Telefontekniken\\", (\\"Transients in telegraph and telephone engineering\\"), Teknisk Tidskrift, no. 9 pp.153-160 and 10 pp.178-182, 1931. (Swedish) :\\"The time law allows comparison of the capacity of each transfer method with various known methods. On the other hand it indicates the limits that the development of technology must stay within. One interesting question for example is where the lower limit for k lies. The answer is acquired by at least one power change being needed to achieve one signal. So the frequency range must be at least so wide that the settling time becomes less than the duration of a signal, and from this comes k=1/2. So we can never get below this value, no matter how technology develops.\\" Textbooks by Küpfmüller * K.

The school was named after Saint John Henry Newman, a 19th-century English convert to Catholicism and prolific author. Located on a magnificent 18 hectare campus, St. John Henry Newman Catholic High School overlooks a broad vista that contains both the Scarborough Bluffs and Lake Ontario. The motto for St. John Henry Newman is Growing in Faith and Truth.  History  Roman Catholic secondary education in Scarborough started its roots when its first high school, Neil McNeil High School opened its doors in 1958 for boys while Notre Dame, a Catholic school for girls, opened in 1941 in which the pupils were bused to the two schools. However, nearby Scarborough Collegiate Institute was erected in 1922 as Scarborough's main high school at that time. Over the next several years, nearby elementary schools surrounding Newman were opened before and after the dawn of the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now today as the Toronto Catholic District School Board) were erected: St. Theresa Shrine of the Little Flower Separate School in 1952, Immaculate Heart of Mary Separate School in 1959 and St. Agatha Separate School in 1964. The facility was built in 1962 as the college for St. Augustine's Seminary due to St. Michael's College lacking a downtown campus for St. Augustine's. The eastern residential wing of the college was demolished and was rebuilt as Cardinal Newman, opened on September 4, 1973 with the new building erected in 1976. In contrast with the schools opened by religious orders, Newman became the first co-educational public separate high school in the former city of Scarborough. From the beginning, Cardinal Newman was staffed by Catholic lay teachers who were teaching exclusively. Cardinal Newman is one of only two high schools in MSSB to focus intently on an integration program for students with special needs. In addition, Cardinal Newman was in the forefront of programs like peer counseling, mediation, electronic keyboarding, and communications technology. Cardinal Newman was at one time the only non-uniformed Roman Catholic High School in Metro Toronto. This was changed beginning in the late 1980s - early 1990s to conform with other local Catholic High Schools. The school name was changed to Blessed Cardinal Newman in February 2011 following the beatification of John Henry Newman. The original address for Newman was 2665 Kingston Road, the address was changed to 100 Brimley Road South in 2003 because the school signage and entrance had moved to the eastern side of the property as well as the driveway. The school's access continued to use the path via the adjacent St. Theresa Shine Catholic School. In November 2018, the Canonization of Blessed Cardinal John Henry Newman was approved. His Canonization took place on October 13, 2019. It was expected that once he gets canonized, the school's name would be promptly readjusted, similar to other schools in the TCDSB such as St. John Paul II Catholic Secondary School, St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy, St. Oscar Romero Catholic Secondary School, St. Kateri Tekakwitha Catholic School, St. John XXIII Catholic School and St. Marguerite Bourgeoys Catholic School. =Replacement school= St. John Henry Newman is one of the oldest buildings within the Toronto Catholic District School Board that needs massive repairs due to aging infrastructure and harsh weather.Boudreau, Evan: \\"$30 million pledged to rebuild Cardinal Newman\\" - The Catholic Register, November 10, 2015. Retrieved on December 27, 2015. The structures built in 1964 and 1976 was originally built to house 666 pupils in capacity and requires some 70% of the building's components to be replaced. Initially, 14 portables with a portapak were scattered across the school to ease perpetual overcrowding with the population doubled its size. In 2008, the portables were realigned to create an extra parking space. Twelve replacement surplus portables came from the Regina Pacis compound and the remaining eight from James Cardinal McGuigan Catholic High School, which constructed an addition at the time totaling to 20 portables. On November 9, 2015, The Ontario Government announced to spend $30 million to construct a modern, state-of-the-art school with learning spaces for 1,110 students. It will be built on the neighbouring property of Scarboro Foreign Mission Society, which will be closing their doors sometime in the early 2020s. Demolition will take place thereafter, and construction of the new school is expected to begin shortly afterwards, with completion of the new school in September 2023.

Architecture  The Okapi Framework is organized around the following parts: * Interface Specifications — The framework's components and applications communicate through several common API sets: the interfaces. A few of them are defined as high-level specifications. Implementing these interfaces allows you to seamlessly plug new components in the overall framework. For example: all filters have the same API to parse input files, so you can write utilities that use any of the available filters. * Format Specifications — Storing and exchanging data is an important part of the localization process. Using open standards for as many formats as possible increases interoperability. Whenever possible the Okapi Framework make use of existing standards such as XLIFF, SRX, TMX, etc. * Components — The Okapi Framework also includes a growing set of components that implement the different interface specifications. Some are basic and low-level parts that can be re-used when programming more high-level components, while others are plug-ins that can be used directly in scripts or applications. * Applications — Lastly, the framework also provides end-user applications that can be utilized out-of-the-box. These tools are making use of the Okapi components and provide ready-made platforms for plugging in your own components.  Components  There are two main types of components: * Filters — Several filters components are implemented, including for: HTML, OpenOffice.org, Microsoft Office files, Java properties files, .NET ResX files, Table-type files (e.g. CSV), Gettext PO files, XLIFF, SDLXLIFF, TMX, Qt TS files, regular-expression-based formats, XML format (including support of the Internationalization Tag Set), IDML (InDesign Markup Language), etc. * Utilities — Several utilities components are implemented, including: Text extraction and merging, RTF to text conversion, encoding conversion, line- break conversion, term extraction, translation comparison, quality check, pseudo-translation, text re-writing, etc.  Applications  Some of the applications using the framework are: * Rainbow — a toolbox to launch a large variety of localization tasks. * Tikal — a command-line tool for basic localization tasks. * Ratel — a WYSIWYG editor to create, test and maintain SRX segmentation rules. * CheckMate — an application to perform quality checks on bilingual files. * Longhorn — a batch processing server. * Ocelot — a specialized XLIFF editor for review and linguistic QA tasks.
