At twenty feet wide, St Michael’s is the second smallest church in the diocese of St Asaph.Site 4 - Efenechtyd - Church of St Michael and All Angels, Medieval-Wales.com. Retrieved 29 March 2018. The circular churchyard suggests Celtic origins. The church may have been founded by monks from St Saeran’s at Llanynys and probably dates from the 13th century. The east window probably dates from c. 1400. The church's most notable feature is its rare medieval wooden font, probably of 15th or 16th-century origin, similar to the stone fonts fashionable at that time. It is made from a single circular oak block with fourteen facets over a ring of beading. Similarly the battlemented rail near the altar is also late medieval and part of a rood screen. Another notable feature includes a fragment of a Welsh wall-painted Ten Commandments, probably Elizabethan or Jacobean. Monuments include a painted timber memorial to Catherine Lloyd (1810) and a Georgian monument to Joseph Conway of Plas-yn- Llan, near the churchyard gate. The church was extensively restored in 1873. The rounded stone by the font is the ‘Maen Camp’, formerly used at the local ‘campau’ (‘Sports’) on St. Michael’s Day, 29 September. Village Samsons strove to hurl it backwards over their heads. The custom of throwing the Feat Stone has been revived in recent years and takes place at the Harvest Festival celebrations.accessdate=2013-11-31], Maen Camp 2013 Sant Mihangel a'r Holl Angylion, Efenechtyd, Sir Ddinbych 02.JPGFont, carved from one piece of wood Sant Mihangel a'r Holl Angylion, Efenechtyd, Sir Ddinbych 06.JPG Sant Mihangel a'r Holl Angylion, Efenechtyd, Sir Ddinbych 14.JPGCarved roode and pulpit Sant Mihangel a'r Holl Angylion, Efenechtyd, Sir Ddinbych 24.JPGRoof beams Sant Mihangel a'r Holl Angylion, Efenechtyd, Sir Ddinbych 30.JPGBack of church References Living Paths Category:Populated places in Denbighshire Category:Wards of Denbighshire ","title":"Efenechtyd"},{"id":"33941624","title":"Stacy Barthe"},{"id":"33941651","text":"Harchakian is a town and sub-tehsil located on the ranital-32-mile road in Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh.

The holotype was collected from the Madygen Formation, dating to the late Carnian or the early Ladinian stage of the late Middle or the early Late Triassic period, about 230-225 million years ago. Thus it represents the oldest known drepanosaurid. Kyrgyzsaurus represents also the first Asian drepanosaurid genus to be named. Etymology Kyrgyzsaurus was first named by V. R. Alifanov and E. N.

It's also known as Cipó Preto (black liana), Pagode caipira (rural pagode) or Pagode sertanejo (folk pagode). Sertanejo means anything that comes from the back-country, outback or simply the countryside. This style of music was pioneered by musicians Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos in the late 1950s, when they fused the \\"Coco\\" and \\"Calango de roda\\" rhythms. Although other instruments can be added, it is much characterized by its simple, acoustic approach, with the use of just one or two viola guitars, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar and, at times, a light percussion section. A structural feature commonly used in this genre is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniment of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira. Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually: when there are two lead vocals (that can be men, women or a combination), they sing together on a steady interval. The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels, and in presentations, songs quite often are linked together, on a medley. Another notable feature are its lyrics, that tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals and so on.

The holotype was collected in Poretskii District of Chuvashia, near Mishukovo, dating to the late Hauterivian faunal stage of the Early Cretaceous, about 133-130 million years ago. The specimen is thought to occupy an intermediate position between the Late Jurassic Tatenectes and Kimmerosaurus and the Late Cretaceous Aristonectes and Kaiwhekea. Berezin (2011) considered Abyssosaurus to represent the first reliable record of Aristonectidae in Russia. A large phylogenetic analysis performed by Roger Benson and Patrick Druckenmiller found it to be a derived cryptoclidid closely related to Colymbosaurus. It is one of the creatures that have incomplete parts in a fossil, still recovering until today. This creature only eats prehistoric fishes and turtles in its territory. Its jaws were powerful that it can crush a turtle shell. Turtles like Archelon are its prey but this creature's size is still unknown until today. The fossils of this creature was found in the Chuvash Lake in Russia but it lacked some many of its parts. But some evidences of plesiosaurs everywhere in Russia was still spotted until today, or it was just the creature itself. We still don't know where the creature's fossils are.

The long-stretched building in Neoclassical style closes the Zwinger courtyard on its northern side. It faces the Zwinger to the south; to the north it borders on the Theater Square (Theaterplatz) with the Semper Opera House as well as Dresden Castle and the Catholic Church of the Royal Court (Katholische Hofkirche). The Semper Gallery houses the Old Masters Picture Gallery (Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister).  History  The Theater Square with the Semper Gallery and the Semperoper (right) around 1900 The Semper Gallery after its destruction in 1945 When the Zwinger was completed in 1728, its northern side towards the Theater Square and the river was left open in order to allow for further enlargements.Fritz Löffler: Das alte Dresden - Geschichte seiner Bauten. 16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006, In 1838, the architect Gottfried Semper was asked to design an appropriate architectural setting for the painting collection of the royal court.Harald Marx: Gemäldegalerie Dresden - Führer Alte Meister . E. A. Seemann, Leipzig, 3. Aufl., 2006, , pp. 8-17. It was not until 1846 that it was decided to close the northern side of the Zwinger courtyard by placing the gallery building there and so creating a gallery wing of the Zwinger. The building, later named the Semper Gallery, was constructed from 1847 until 1854. It is reminiscent of the Italian Palazzi of the Renaissance. In 1855, the interior was completed. Unlike the former buildings that housed the painting collection, the interior of the Semper Gallery could be heated and therefore could remain open throughout the year. In 1855 the collection was moved into the Semper Gallery, which opened as the New Royal Museum (Neues Königliches Museum). The sculptors Ernst Rietschel and Ernst Julius Hähnel from Dresden completed the outer decoration of the building.Bärbel Stefan: Ernst Rietschel – Zum 200. Geburtstag des Bildhauers, Skulpturensammlung der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden, 2004 While the northern facade towards the Theater Square displays antique themes, the southern facade contains paintings with religious themes. Until World War II, the Semper Gallery housed not only the painting collection, by now named Old Masters Gallery, but also the Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs and the Collection of Classical Sculptures. The building was severely damaged during the February 13, 1945 bombing of Dresden. Most of the paintings were evacuated for safe- keeping earlier and so were not harmed. The building's reconstruction was completed in 1960. Following another restoration period of more than four years, the Semper Gallery re-opened in 1992.

Among these host species were two endemic species of rats: Rattus macleari and Rattus nativitatis. Both are now believed to be extinct. It is not very clear whether or not the same parasite infected both species. However, both parasites are very similar. The northern rat flea, Nosopsyllus fasciatus acts as the vector for the parasite, harboring the epimastigote stage in its midgut. The trypomastigote is the stage that is present in the main host, the rodent. The epimastigote form attaches itself to the rectum of the insect using its flagella to burrow through the rectal walls. The parasites also appear in the flea's feces. Ingestion of either the flea or its feces during grooming infects the host rodent with the parasites. T. lewisi is normally non- pathogenic but is known to have produced fatal infections in rats. History Trypanosomes in the blood of rats were first noted and described by Timothy Richards Lewis from Calcutta and the species was named after him. In the 1900s, a parasitologist noticed that Rattus macleari, a species of rat endemic to Christmas Island, were becoming sick. The suspected cause was a species of trypanosomes. There was no proof that this was actually correct until scientists from the American Museum of Natural History deposited some rats that had been collected from Christmas Island as specimens into museums. Scientists argue that Trypanosoma lewisi is partially or wholly responsible for the subsequent extinction of Rattus macleari. The parasites were transmitted from fleas infesting the then recently introduced black rats (Rattus rattus). Research T. lewisi can be cultured in various media including in vivo in rat serum and in vitro in mammalian cell culture media. The parasite can also be grown in mice if the host is supplemented with a controlled diet and intraperitoneal injection of rat serum. Ablastin, an antibody that arises during an infection in the host’s body, prevents the parasite from reproducing although they remain in adult form. A research paper suggests that the data on the aftermath of introduction of a Trypanosoma lewisi to immunologically naïve murine hosts on Christmas Island around 1900 matches reports of complete extinction within the range of 1–9 years. This gives some more information on the first pathogen introduction to a species to have caused species extinction. Although rare, there were also many cases in which human beings and primates were infected with Trypanosoma lewisi. In a recent study comparing Brazilian isolates in rats and primates, it was found the DNA sequences were the same when considering Trypanosoma lewisi. This further proves the potential of Trypanosoma lewisi's ability to infect human beings, despite being rare in most cases. Life cycle of Trypanosoma lewisi Life cycle A flea bites an infected rodent and ingests its blood. Within six hours, the parasites migrate and reproduce in the epithelial cells of their host flea's stomach. They then go further into the lumen of the stomach and finally move into the insect's rectum. The parasite's metacyclic trypomastigote infects a rat after it eats the host flea or the flea's feces. Once inside the rat's body, the parasite will then begin reproducing epimastigotes in the blood capillaries of the host. After about five days, trypanosomes will begin appearing in the peripheral blood of the host, with the appearance of thick worms. These parasites are usually attacked by ablastin, a trypanocidal IgG antibody produced by their host's immune system beginning 2–4 days postinfection. After a few weeks, the trypanosomes stop growing and disappear from the bloodstream. The rat then develops immunity against re-infection.

In 1514, he received the County of Harburg, the city of Riquewihr and Bilstein Castle. In 1519, his older brother, Duke Ulrich was deposed and exiled from Württemberg. George tried to support him militarily, and was forced to go into exile to Strasbourg. On 2 September 1526, Ulrich sold him the County of Montbéliard and associated Lordships, with an option to buy it back. In 1531, George joined the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against Emperor Charles V. With the help of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, his brother Ulrich was able to regain power in Württemberg. Ulrich re-purchased Montbéliard and in 1542, appointed his son Christopher as governor there. After the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in 1547, the Emperor intended to take the Country of Montbéliard. Ulrich died in 1550.

Arguable among historians, Lovati is considered the \\"father of Humanism.\\" His literary Padua circle included Rolando de Piazzola, Geremia da Montagnone, and Albertino Mussato. Lovati's scholarship marked characteristics which would later define the development of humanism: an appetite for classical texts; a philological concern to correct them, and ascertain their meaning; and a desire to imitate them.Mann 2011, p. 7. Scholars such as Petrarch commented on his works favorably. Lovati's achievements which survive today are his Latin verse epistles, and his short commentary of Seneca's tragedies.  Early life, education, and career  The exact birthdate of Lovato Lovati is not known, William Sisler suggests 1241 whereas Ronald Witt asserts that it is 1240. However it is certain that Lovato was born in Padua.Witt 2000, p. 92.Sisler \\"Translation of Lovato Lovati's 'Metrical Epistles' with parallel passages from ancient authors.\\", 1. Lovato's father, Rolando Lovati, was a notary along with Lovato's brother, Alberto Lovati. A young Lovato in the 1250s and 1260s benefitted greatly from a revival of formal study of ancient texts, this revival took place in the studio of Padua, which was the local university.Witt 2000, p.95 During these years it is possible that Lovato was taught by Ronaldino of Padua, a writer at the time.Witt 2000, p.94. Lovato was tasked with educating his nephew, Rolando da Piazzola, and he later dedicated a poem to him.Witt 2000, p.111 This nephew was the son of his sister who married Guido da Piazzola. Despite being among the progenitors of the Italian humanist movement, Lovato Lovati's primary occupation was his work as a notary and judge. Although Lovato was enamoured by his poetic, scholarly, and literary interests; the majority of Lovato's time was consumed by his occupation.Witt 2000, p.103. At the age of 16 or 17 Lovato began to work as a notary making copies from his father's register, a signature on a document dated in 1257 suggests that Lovato's formal education had ended by this point. It seems that Lovato's father, Rolando, intended for Lovato to have the same career as him. On May 6, 1267 Lovato was accepted into Padua's College of Judges at the age of 26 or 27. At least six years of formal legal study was required for admission into the College, implying that by this point in time Lovato had completed this. Within the first year of being admitted into the college of judges Lovato composed two poems: one to Compagnino(a Paduan lawyer and friend of Lovato), and another poem written in dactylic hexameter. One year later in 1268, Lovato married Jacopina de Vicenzo da Solesina with whom he had a son named Ronaldo. By 1271 Lovato was a judge in the palace of the Commune, and in 1273 he became gastaldo of the College of Judges. Although the positions of notary and judge were not socially esteemed positions, Lovato used his profession to bolster his fortune and influence in Padua. The following is a brief list of Lovato Lovati's career accomplishments outside his poetic work: *In 1275 Lovato was involved in the acquisition of land for a Paduan hospital named \\"Domus Dei\\" *In 1282 Lovato became podesta of Bassano *In 1283 an archeological discovery occurred, and the remains from a large corpse were found. Lovato identified them as the remains as Antenor, who was the mythical trojan founder of Padua. Lovato was commissioned to create an inscription for a sarcophagus made for the remains.Mann 2011, p. 6. *In 1284 Lovato witnessed at a resolution given by Lodovico Capodivaca *In 1286 Lovato assisted in the hall of the Maggiore Consiglio *In 1287 he assisted in the Bishop's residence *In 1288 Lovato assisted in the church of St. Martin *In 1290 he assisted in the Office of the Inquisition *In 1291 Lovato became a knight and podesta of Vicenza *In 1295 he assisted in the convent of St. AnthonySisler, 1977, p.1. The security of Padua seems to have been an important concern to Lovato during his lifetime, he expressed anxiety in his poetry over the threat of Venice and Charles of Anjou.Ronald G. Witt, \\"Latini, Lovato and the Revival of Antiquity,\\" Dante Studies, with the Annual Report of the Dante Society 112 (1994): 6. For the majority of Lovato's life Padua pursued an aggressive policy or territorial expansion: by 1267 Vicenza and Bassano were both brought under Paduan territory. In 1304 Lovato was selected to appear as a witness for the Paduan alliance with Verona.Sisler, 1977, p.2. Although he was deceased by this time, in the early 14th century Padua absorbed the county of Rovigo.Witt, 2000, p.109. Lovato's opinions on this political instability was often expressed in his poetry, in 1302 the Paduan poet Mussato called on Lovato in a poem to predict the consequences of Padua's warfare with Charles of Anjou and several Tuscan cities. Lovato responded by stating his fears that the conflict would lead to increased factionalism within Padua and reasoned that liberty would only thrive in a time of peace. In Lovato's final years he seems to be cognisant of the weakness of the Paduan commune, possibly taking Padua's defeat by the Venetian salt monopoly in 1304 as a bad omen. In October 1304 following the Treaty of Treviso, a treaty that ended the salt war with Venice, a poem Lovato wrote to Mussato displays his anxiety over the treaty. Lovato was concerned that the peace might not be genuine and that animosity between the two cities would continue. Although Lovato felt that the treaty gave an unequal advantage to Venice, Lovato urged for peace in his poems and thought the loss of salt marshes was minor compared to peace. In one of his poems at the time, Lovato stated: \\"Peace, even a simulated one, is peace: often the true follows the feigned.\\"Witt, 2000, p.109-111. Along with Mussato, Lovato was part of a circle of Paduan literacy that met to discuss and create poetic works.Witt, Ronald G. \\"The Origins of Italian Humanism: Padua and Florence.\\" The Centennial Review 34, no. 1 (1990): 92-108. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23738952. Albertino Mussato is often credited as being the brightest member of this circle.Sisler, 1977, p.7. Lovato often enjoyed conversations with another member of this circle, Bellino Bissoli; both authors had drastically different approaches to poetry.Witt, 2000, p.112. Lovato died on March 7, 1309. Prior to his death Lovato prepared epitaphs to embellish his resting place, leaving two inscriptions on his tomb.Sisler, 1977, p.3. According to Giovanni del Virgilio, on Lovato's deathbed he gave his reed pipes to Albertino Mussato and said: \\"Since you are deemed gifted by the muses, by these will you be muse-inspired. Ivy will circle your temples.\\" This symbolic gesture can be seen as way of Lovato recognizing Mussato as his poetic heir.Witt, 2000, p.117.  Ideology  On the imitation of ancient philosophy It was around 1290 when Lovato Lovati affirmed his intention to follow in the footsteps of the ancient poets—a principle that conditioned his whole approach to antiquity. In a letter written to his friend, Bellino Bissolo, Lovati declared, \\"Your actions, in order to be praiseworthy, should be distant from the two extremes by an equal distance…However, if you must \\"Err\\" on one side, it should be on the side of the daring.\\"Sisler, 1977, p. 53. Although ridiculed for his rigid maintenance of ancient poetic standards, Lovati was motivated to apply himself into ancient texts. Lovato compared his willingness to absorb ancient principles to several Greek ancients such as Capeneus and Achilles. In response towards critiques he wrote, \\"I won't change my mind. I stand fast, as in my habit, and I won't correct the vice of my long disease.\\"Sisler, 1977, p. 54. On ancient literature While assessing ancient literature, Lovato characterized three features which mark the development of humanism: an appetite for classical texts; a philological concern to correct them and ascertain their meaning, and a desire to imitate them.Mann, 2011, p. 7. Noted by Petrarch, it was Lovato's study of law which introduced him to the ancient literature. However while drawing on ancient Roman sources for their own work, Lovato and his disciple Albertino Mussato, showed little interest in investigating the nature of the society, that produced them.Witt, 2012, p. 700 Lovato's poetry exposed his confused notion of the ancient past, where Greek and Roman history and mythology mingle without distinction as their basis in reality. Yet, Lovati's success demonstrated his profound intensive study of ancient law, vocabulary and phraseology. His stylistic accomplishments, and ability to imitate ancient Latin, suggest that he was at least making a beginning of establishing an emotional and intellectual contact with a segment of the ancient experience.Witt, 1990, p. 96. A keen admirer of the Roman dramatist Seneca, Lovato demonstrated his clear understanding of metrical structure of ancient Latin poetry, later producing the earliest Renaissance treatise on metrics. He wrote a short account of Senecan meters,Nauert, 1995,p. 6. illustrating Latin poet's preference for two verse patterns, the pentameter and the hexameter.Rabil, 1988, p. 73. In his letters, Lovato strives to match classical vocabulary, meter and tone, revealing a strong emphasis of grammatical components towards the literary movement. Evidently, Lovato only reformed his poetry, leaving his prose untouched. Unlike his poetry, Lovato's Dictamina borrowed few phrases from ancient authors, not erecting the effect of ancient prose.Witt, 2001, p. 30. This bifurcation of Lovato's work is characteristic of the literary movement he pioneered for the first forty years. On language In the 1180s, French culture slowly emerged in the Italian peninsula, propelling an indigenous literary and intellectual development. The French cultural movement encouraged poets to reflect on the historiography of grammar within poetry.Witt, 2001, p. 51. As a result, pressure increased to intensify the study of ancient French and Provençal texts. This pressure, combined with his spirit of competition, inspired Lovato to not only write, but also defend ancient Latin poetry against those who preferred modern vernacular verse.Witt, 2000, p. 54. He argued against using the vernacular language in poetry and song.Witt, 1990, p. 100. For instance he wrote, \\"At random, he mutilated songs in French, gaping in barbarous fashion, rolling them out as he pleased, no part of them in their proper order, songs relying on no effort.\\"Sisler, 1977, p. 50. Lovato described the French as simply comprehensible to popular audience, easy, and loose, thus revealing his disdain for the language.Witt 1990, p. 98.  On mythology and self-praise Lovato was involved in a large discovery of the ceremonious reburial and supposed body remains of the mythical founder of Padua, the Trojan Antenor.Nauert, 1995 p. 6. The reception of his discovery illustrated the depth of admiration felt by the multitude for an ancient society that was a part of their cultural mythology. In contrast to his interest in mythology, Lovato was immensely critical over the influence of self-praise on his works. In order to convey his clarity and knowledge, Lovato recognized self-praise would only inhibit and clutter his execution of poetry and prose.Sisler, 1977, p. 52.  Writing style, work and achievements  Lovato dei Lovati was highly regarded by Petrarch and others prominent humanists as a forerunner in the classicising movement. The literary circle led by Lovato, based in the mid thirteenth century Paduan commune was one of the first scholarly groups of people in Europe to embrace the humanistic philosophical outlook and to develop a revived interest in ancient text. Ronald Witt argues that denying Lovato and his followers of the Humanist title by subordinating them to a lesser position as Petrarch in the humanist movement would not do them the justice they deserve.Witt 2000, p. 21. Lovato's first poems began to appear in the 1250s displaying evidence of his urge to reconnect with the ancient past thus marking the start of the classicising movement. Lovato's decision to compose poetry in Latin instead of the vernaculars, as it was the trend of the time was not coincidental. During the late twelfth century, French and Provençal models exerted large influence on the vernacular poetry of northern Italy.Witt 2000, p. 40. The popularity of the vernacular poetry invoked a sense of competition in Lovato, which pushed him to write in Latin.Witt 2000, 52-3. This sense of competition with the vernacular was not directed towards the native Paduan dialect but rather to French.Witt, 1990, p. 97. During mid thirteenth century, there was a development of a new interest in composing Latin poetry among northern and central Italian literary scholars such Bellino Bissolo and Bonvesin de la Riva but Lovato was the first among these poets to write in perfectly classicising Latin and included in his work themes that were unconventional to the Latin Italian poetic tradition.  Reintroduction of ancient authors and rare work  Despite Lovato's condescending feelings towards the vernacular referring to them as \\"barbarous\\" in one of his letters to Bellino Bissolo, he nonetheless incorporated many of the French and Provençal influences in his poems.Witt, 2000, p. 52-3. In the first of the two letters of his surviving works written to his friend Campagnino discussing about his illness in poems, allusions to the French romantic poem Tristan and Isolde was evident.Witt, 2000, p. 96. The poem consists of 227 elegiac lines incorporating various ancient sources in his writing. In addition, Lovato in his poem reintroduced some of the unheard ancient authors to his audiences such as Tibullus, Propertius, Martial, Catullus, and Lucretius whom regular contemporary medieval Europeans may have never heard of for the past several centuries.Witt, 2000, p. 97. Witt, 1990, p. 96. Rare works from authors whom were somewhat more familiar to the educated class in medieval Europe were also brought once again to people's awareness.Witt, 2000, p. 98. These included Horace's Carmina and Statius' Silvae. Ovid's Metamorphoses, which was well known to his contemporary audiences, also influenced the poem.  Writing style  In composing this poem Lovato at times experienced difficulties mastering the language in describing his thoughts, which explains why certain passages sounded more like prose. The biblical references used were said to have tainted the classicising character of the poem. The second poem to Campagnino discussing about his plan to marry was in dactylic hexameter. The vocabulary Lovato employed in his poems at this time was generally classical in character, as well as displaying accurate use of metrics coherent with ancient models. Despite Lovato's overall humanistic approach in composing poetry, many evidences suggest that the Paduan notary was not completely broken away from medieval characteristics. Lovato's fondness with the Leonine verse, a form of rhythmic structure in Latin poetry popular in the Middle Ages, the inclusion of many Christian references in his own epitaph as well as his poems, the allusion to Tristan and Isolde all exemplify his imperfect secession with the medieval tradition.Sisler, 1977, p. 166-7.  Contribution  Lovato created many manuscripts during his lifetime, many of which were lost. A survived manuscript which is now preserved in the British Library which Lovato copied personally, included his two letters to Campagnino as well as his two other letters, one letter written to him from his friend Ugo Mezzabati, and works of Justin, Pompeius Trogus, and Bede. Lovato's lost manuscript of Livy, which included many rare works played significant role in helping to revive Livy's work in the centuries to come.Witt, 2000, p. 99. Lovato's manuscript of Seneca's Tragedies was a centrepiece among his life's accomplishments, which served a key role in the movement for the revival of Seneca's work. Witt, 2000, p. 100. Lovato attached an essay at the end of the manuscript Seneca's Tragedies discussing the metrical schemes in Seneca's plays. Other than rare works such as Horace's Carmina and Statius's Silvae being brought back into the awareness of Western Europeans for the first time in three to four centuries, Lovato also made known Ovid's Ibis and Martial's Epigramus to his medieval audiences.  French/Provençal elements  Despite his insistence on adhering to classical literary model and the orthodoxy of the Latin language, Lovato's work was not impermeable to the popular French influences, which were appreciated and adopted by many of his contemporary Italian poets. Allusions to the French romance Tristan and Isolde and several other examples included in the first letter to Compagnino together suggest that Lovato's work demonstrates evidence of French langue d'oc and langue d'oil elements.Witt, 2000, p. 101. Moreover, Lovato assumed the Provençal custom to have sobriquets. T> His later poems' mimic that of the vernacular sonnet, except that they were written in Latin instead of French. Witt, 2000, p. 102. Inspired by the Provençal tenzone, a form of poetry, which has its origin in France, Lovato adopted the practice of using poetry as a medium of debate. The aforementioned examples all serve as evidences of the influence exerted on him by the French tradition.  Later poems: on politics and morality  Lovato's later poems were easily distinguishable from his earlier poems because of their differences not just in style but also in content and theme. Lovato's later poems became more concentrated on the subjects such as politics and morality.Witt, 2000, p. 103. Stylistically Lovato's later poems were more medieval in character. Despite the maintenance of the use classical vocabulary in his writing, the overemphasis of assonance, the use of per tempora, and the quasi-paratactic structure were all examples of his falling way from the classical model. The later poems also \\"lack intensity\\" and were deficient of metaphorical language. The references he included in the poems were sometimes incoherent with the central theme of what he wanted to say.Witt, 2000, p. 104. Lovato's concessions to Medievalism in his later poems was not believed to be a transformation in aesthetic ideals but simply a loss of inspiration. With regards to poems on morality, Lovato had a poetic debate with Mussato on the question of whether or not it is better to have children.Witt, 2000, p. 106. They debated the practical impacts on individuals of having children with Lovato arguing that children were \\"source of father's grief, not happiness\\".Witt, 2000, p. 107. In the end Lovato was declared winner by Zambono. In his correspondence with Mussato c. 1302, Lovato offered his insight on the impact of the war between Charles II of Anjou with the Tuscan cities on Padua at Mussato's request.Witt, 2000, p. 109. In his work written on factionalism, De conditionibus urbis Padue et peste Guelfi et Gibolengi nominis, Lovato predicted that the military tension in central Italy might initiate factionalism in Padua. During the time when Treaty of Treviso, which ended the war over salt trade with Venice, was signed, Lovato exchanged views with Mussato on whether this peace would last.Witt, 2000, p. 110. He was worried that Paduans would not accept the treaty terms willingly due to the freedom that was stripped away from them.  Prose/Ars Dictaminis Lovato's surviving prose in the British Library manuscript evidenced that he adhered strictly to medieval ars dictaminis, following obediently the standard medieval model for writing prose which consists of salutatio, followed by exordium, narratio, petitio, and conclusio.Witt, 2000, p. 135. Stylistically, Lovato's prose has a solemn tone of voice and the language was medieval in character with over emphasis on colores. Lovato displayed a preference for stylus altus (high style) form of letter writing, which was the most prestigious and difficult of them all.  Influence on other Renaissance scholars  We cannot assume that the influence of Lovato on other poets and scholars of the Renaissance is direct, but his general belief in the magnificence of Latin verse and his unique compositions made it the preferred form of expression in the period. According to Witt,\\"The first to capture with consistency the flavor of the classical authors and to state explicitly that imitation f the ancients was his goal, Lovato may rightfully be considered the founder of Italian humanism.\\"Witt, 2000, p. 78, Thereby making his influence on Renaissance humanism potent. Lovato introduced to the poets of the 14th century, through his work and influence, the importance of being precise and correct. By making the writings of the ancient world his guiding spirit, he was able to bring about a conscious intellectual change in the manner in which poets perceived the environment around them. Further, through an analysis of the grammatical component and the syntax of the works of early ages, he was able to bring about \\"'a reorganization of consciousness,' habits of expressing ideas with precision and nuances that both unlocked the mentality of the classical authors and allowed the humanists themselves to approach their own work with that perspective.\\"Witt, 1994, p. 58. Playing the role as a notary, he advanced the cause of classical learning and the use of classical texts through his use of these texts and employ classical imagery in his poetry. In his writings, from the first instances of his poetical composition, as seen in the letters of 1267/68, they would be the first \\"written by an Italian since late antiquity to employ classical diction for the expression of private thoughts and feelings\\"Witt, 2000, p. 99 through a conscious discarding of the vernacular taste that had been influenced by the French works. Among those specifically influenced and dedicated to Lovato's style of writing and expression was Albertino Mussato, one of his disciples. Mussato, in the later years of his life, in spite of his deep interactions with Lovato gave credit to Buonincontro da Mantova as his teacher, but the latter, like other intellectuals from Padua, such as Zambbono di Andrea and Ugo Mezzabati were deeply influenced by Lovato, thereby indicating that Mussato derived much from Lovato's stylistic schemes. Lovato Lovati's influence upon the succeeding generation of poets of the humanist tradition can also be seen in his great familiarity with the writings of the ancients who were unknown to writers and poets that came even 3 to 4 centuries before them, thereby reiterating the idea that classical Latin texts had been generally given up in favour of the French. Through his translations and writings Lovato introduced to the poets of 13th and 14th century Italy the works of \\"Tibulus Catullus, and Propertius... Lucretius and Martial.\\"Witt, 1990, p. 96 Lovato's poetry was informed by the desire to emulate his predecessors especially from ancient Rome and he did so by \\"imitating ancient eloquence in the ancients own language.\\"Witt, 1994, p. 57 and this model would inspire later generations who would discard the Provençal form in favour of their own classical examples. Petrarch is considered one of the greatest humanists and often titled the \\"father of humanism\\" in the Italian Renaissance. He owed much of his humanistic tendencies to the study of the classical texts of ancient Rome, especially the writings of Seneca. Seneca's writings, especially his moral writings, \\"exercised tremendous influence on early humanists concerned with ethical problems.\\"Witt, 2000, p. 123. And it was Lovato's belief in the promise of a better time as expounded by Seneca, which coloured his poetry and ultimately helped formulate the thinking of Petrarch towards such matters. Also, in his humanistic philosophy and its explication and embrace of the secular and civic life, Petrarch showed himself to be more of a \\"grammarian than that of a rhetorician\\"Witt, 2000, p. 243 much like Lovato. Among one of the most important ideas of the humanistic philosophy of the specific period was a desire to lead the good life, understood in the sense of being happy and contribute to the world around oneself. The idea of deeply engaging with matters of faith was not an important part of the philosophy of the humanistic tradition, unlike that of the many periods which came before it. In his analysis of his beliefs, Lovato states \\"I want nothing except to enjoy happy times, and when sweet things are lacking, to die sweetly.\\"Witt, 2000, p. 156. This same tendency is seen in the writings of poets like Coluccio Salutati who would place great emphasis on such qualities as friendship, human happiness and the role of fate and destiny in human endeavors. The influence of Lovato Lovati on subsequent Italian humanism which would mark the beginning of the Renaissance is undeniable. In general, he should be considered to be the one who introduced 13th century Padua to the glories of ancient Rome through the utilisation of ancient Latin vocabulary and texts and its dissemination to other regions of learning in 14th century Italy. The compositional technique, stress upon creating works of poetry rather than use the prosaic style and bringing about secularity in the subject matter of such compositions, have given a new direction to writers of this period.

According to the literary historian Marko Juvan, the work may be considered the Slovene national epic. It is a narration about a hero and the woman he loves in the time of violent Christianisation of the predecessors of the Slovenes. Creation and publication The poem was written in the Bohorič alphabet from July 1835 until January 1836 and self-published in April 1836. It was printed in 600 copies in Ljubljana by Josef Blasnik. Structure The poem comprises over 500 verses and has three parts. The first part of the poem, added approximately ten years later, is a sonnet dedicating the work to Prešeren's late friend Matija Čop. The second part, the Introduction (), describes the final battle between Christians and pagan Slavs, led by the hero Črtomir. It is composed of 25 three-line and one four- line stanza and segues directly into the poem's third part, the Baptism (), focusing on the reunion of Črtomir and Bogomila, who had been the priestess of the goddess Živa but is now a Christian. She persuades Črtomir to get baptised too. Part three is composed of 53 ottava rimas. It has less of an epic character than the second, as it mainly focuses on the emotions of individuals. The epics themes include Slovene identity in the context of the nation's conversion to Christianity. Depictions Farewell, relief by Ivan Zajec on the Prešeren Monument in Ljubljana A motif from the poem is depicted in the bronze relief on the right side of the pedestal of Prešeren Monument at Prešeren Square, the main square in Ljubljana. It is titled Farewell () or Črtomir and Bogomila (). It was created by the sculptor Ivan Zajec in the beginning of the 20th century. It has a Classicist composition, a Realist cadre, an impressionist final touch, and emphasises Prešeren's Romantic poetry with its content. Musical arrangements *The Croatian composer Božidar Širola (1889–1956) used the poem for the libretto of his cantata The Baptism on the Savica (; 1911). *In 1920, the Slovene composer Slavko Osterc (1895–1941) used motifs from the poem for his symphonic picture The Baptism on the Savica (). Performed for the first time on 22 February 1921 in Ptuj by the Maribor Military Music () orchestra, it was his first piece of work that was presented at a concert. It was also performed by the same orchestra on 22 April in Celje in the support of the construction of the . Until August 1921, he also wrote a Neoromantic opera with the same title, but it was never performed. The libretto was written by Osterc and the Maribor educator . *The poem was used for the major part of the libretto of the chamber opera The Baptism on the Savica, written in 2015 by the Slovene composer Tom Kobe (born 1988). It was put to stage in collaboration with the Jurij Slatkonja Mixed Choir from Novo Mesto, and premiered with a great success in the city's cultural centre, in November 2015.

General principles Although utility can be demonstrated by commercial success, it only requires that the invention is directed to a practical use and that it does what is indicated in the patent. The mechanism underlying an invention's function does not need to be disclosed in the patent. If a mechanism is proposed in the patent but is subsequently disproven, the patent is not invalidated.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyrights, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011). An invention is useful if it does what it promises; following the directions should result in the desired effect. The inventor does not have to have created the product of the invention, but the specifications must disclose an actual way to do so.X v Canada (Commissioner of Patents) (1981), 59 CPR (2d) 7, [1981] FCJ No 1013. A patent is addressed to a person skilled in the art, and any prior art and knowledge that such a person would have can be taken into consideration when the patent is being interpreted by the courts.Burton Parsons Chemicals Inc v Hewlett Packard (Canada) Inc (1974), 54 DLR (3d) 711, [1976] 1 SCR 555.

Later proof of an invention’s inutility can be used to invalidate a patent.Apotex Inc v Wellcome Foundation Ltd, 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 SCR 153. Sound prediction The utility of an invention can be established by sound prediction where “utility can be predicted in advance of complete testing.\\" This is a question of fact, and there are three prongs to the doctrine:Apotex Inc v Wellcome Foundation Ltd, 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 SCR 153. # There must be a factual basis for the prediction. # The inventor must have an articulable and sound line of reasoning from which the desired result can be inferred from the factual basis. # There must be proper disclosure. Rationale The grant of a patent gives the inventor a monopoly in the market for its product. This monopoly is granted in exchange for the disclosure of the invention which can be further developed by society. The requirement that the invention is useful ensures that society receives accurate and complete disclosure.Apotex Inc v Wellcome Foundation Ltd, 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 SCR 153. That a patent does not have to be economically useful is justified by the fact that these kinds of discoveries may lay the foundation for more profitable discoveries.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyrights, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011).

It has evolved to take many different forms depending on the country and region, both in costume and dance style; with Egyptian style and its famous traditional rhymes being the most common worldwide having many schools around the globe practicing it. Names and terminology \\"Belly dance\\" is a translation of the French term danse du ventre, which was coined in 1864 as a snide nickname for the Orientalist painting The Dance of the Almeh by French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme.La danse de l'almée (The Dance of the Almeh) by Jean-Léon Gérôme, 1863 The painting depicts a woman dancing before an audience of seated soldiers in a fantasy Middle Eastern setting. The dancer's costume, with its small vest and gauzy blouse, seems to have been inspired by contemporary Awalem (Egyptian slang for Dancers) women's clothing. Where the Awalem woman of the period would have worn an elbow-length blouse tucked in to her skirt at the waist, however, this dancer's sheer blouse is open over her bare breasts and her nude abdomen is thrust toward the viewer of the painting. Over time, danse du ventre came to be used in French for all solo, torso-articulated dances of Middle Eastern origin. The English translation \\"belly dance\\" seems to have made its first appearance in 1889 in reference to the Egyptian dancers who performed at the Exposition Universelle that was held in Paris that year. The informal, social form of the dance is known as Raqs Baladi ('Dance of the Country' or 'Folk Dance') in Egyptian Arabic and is considered an indigenous dance. Raqs Sharqi ('Eastern Dance') is a broad category of professional forms of the dance, including forms of belly dance as we know it today, such as Raqs Baladi, Sa'idi, Ghawazee and Awalim. Randa Kamel, Egyptian belly dancerBelly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips. Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis. In common with most folk dances, there is no universal naming scheme for belly dance movements. Some dancers and dance schools have developed their own naming schemes, but none of these is universally recognized. One of the most common naming schemes is that of the Salimpour Format, introduced by Suhaila and Jamila Salimpour. Jamila Salimpour was the first to coin many now-popular names of belly dance moves,The Salimpour Legacyhttp://www.sabriyetekbilek.com/workshops-with-suhaila-salimpour including steps such as the Basic Egyptian, Choo Choo, Maya, and Turkish Drop. But these commonly-held terms are the exception, rather than the rule, in the belly dance world. Movements found in belly dance Many of the movements characteristic of belly dance can be grouped into the following categories: * Percussive movements: Staccato movements, most commonly of the hips, used to punctuate the music or accent a beat. Typical movements in this group include hip drops, vertical hip rocks, outwards hip hits, hip lifts and hip twists. Percussive movements using other parts of the body can include lifts or drops of the ribcage and shoulder accents. * Fluid movements: Flowing, sinuous movements in which the body is in continuous motion, used to interpret melodic lines and lyrical sections in the music, or modulated to express complex instrumental improvisations. These movements require a great deal of abdominal muscle control. Typical movements include horizontal and vertical figures of 8 or infinity loops with the hips, horizontal or tilting hip circles, and undulations of the hips and abdomen. These basic shapes may be varied, combined and embellished to create an infinite variety of complex, textured movements. * Shimmies, shivers and vibrations: Small, fast, continuous movements of the hips or ribcage, which create an impression of texture and depth of movement. Shimmies are commonly layered over other movements, and are often used to interpret rolls on the tablah or riq or fast strumming of the oud or qanun (instrument). There are many types of shimmy, varying in size and method of generation. Some common shimmies include relaxed, up and down hip shimmies, straight-legged knee-driven shimmies, fast, tiny hip vibrations, twisting hip shimmies, bouncing 'earthquake' shimmies, and relaxed shoulder or ribcage shimmies. In addition to these torso movements, dancers in many styles will use level changes, travelling steps, turns and spins. The arms are used to frame and accentuate movements of the hips, for dramatic gestures, and to create beautiful lines and shapes with the body, particularly in the more balletic, Westernised styles. Other movements may be used as occasional accents, such as low kicks and arabesques, backbends, and head tosses. In the Middle East Origins and history Mural painting of a meeting between Shah Tahmasp and the Mughal emperor Humayun found in IranBelly dancing is believed to have had a long history in the Middle East. Several Greek and Roman sources including Juvenal and Martial describe dancers from Asia Minor and Spain using undulating movements, playing castanets, and sinking to the floor with \\"quivering thighs\\", descriptions that are certainly suggestive of the movements that are today associated with belly dance. Later, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, European travellers in the Middle East such as Edward Lane and Flaubert wrote extensively of the dancers they saw there, including the Awalim and Ghawazee of Egypt. In the Ottoman Empire, belly dance was performed by both boys and women in the Sultan's palace. Social context Mexican Carmen Fragoso is among the new generation of dancers known for their online presence. Belly dance in the Middle East has two distinct social contexts: as a folk or social dance, and as a performance art. As a social dance, belly dance (also called Raqs Baladi or Raqs Shaabi in this context) is performed at celebrations and social gatherings by ordinary people (male and female, young and old), in their ordinary clothes. In more conservative or traditional societies, these events may be gender segregated, with separate parties where men and women dance separately. Historically, professional dance performers were the Awalim (primarily musicians and poets), Ghawazi, and Köçekler. The Maazin sisters may have been the last authentic performers of Ghawazi dance in Egypt, with Khayreyya Maazin still teaching and performing as of 2009.Gilded Serpent \\"The Ghawazee: Back from the Brink of Extinction\\". In the modern era, professional performers (including dancers, singers, and actors) are not considered to be respectable in more conservative Middle Eastern countries, and there is a strong social stigma attached to female performers in particular, since they display their bodies in public, which is considered haram in Islam. However, in Lebanon, Turkey, Morocco, Iraq and unofficially in Iran and Egypt the art is still celebrated and performed. In Egypt Many bellydancers work in Cairo. The modern Egyptian belly dance style (and the modern costume) are said to have originated in Cairo's nightclubs. Many of the local dancers went on to appear in Egyptian films and had a great influence on the development of the Egyptian style and became famous, like Samia Gamal and Taheyya Kariokka, both of whom helped attract eyes to the Egyptian style worldwide. Traditional belly dancer on a Cairo Nile River cruiseProfessional belly dance in Cairo has not been exclusive to native Egyptians, although the country prohibited foreign-born dancers from obtaining licenses for solo work for much of 2004 out of concern that potentially inauthentic performances would dilute its culture. (Other genres of performing arts were not affected.) The ban was lifted in September 2004, but a culture of exclusivity and selectivity remained. The few non-native Egyptians permitted to perform in an authentic way invigorated the dance circuit and helped spread global awareness of the art form. American-born Layla Taj is one example of a non-native Egyptian belly dancer who has performed extensively in Cairo and the Sinai resorts. Egyptian belly dance is noted for its controlled, precise movements. Although it's seen as a dance mainly for women, nowadays we see many men trying to defy these social norms. In Iran (Persia) Iranian (Persian) Belly Dance looks like Arab (Iraqi) belly dance, and Persians refer to it as \\"Arabic dance\\". In Turkey Egyptian belly dance is referred to in Turkey as Oryantal Dans, or simply 'Oryantal'. Many professional dancers and musicians in Turkey continue to be of Romani heritage, and the Roma people of Turkey have had a strong influence on the Turkish style. In Turkey the style of belly dance is lively and playful, with a greater outward projection of energy than the more contained and artistic Egyptian style. In Turkey dancers are known for their energetic, athletic (even gymnastic) style, and their adept use of finger cymbals, also known as zils, which are commonly used in Egyptian style and movies. Connoisseurs of Turkish style often say a dancer who cannot play the zils is not an accomplished dancer. Floorwork, which has been banned in Egypt since the mid-20th century, is still a part of Turkish belly dance. Another distinguishing element of Turkish style is the use of a rhythm, divided as , often referred to as the Karsilama rhythm. Karşilama, in Turkish dance, is not a rhythm but a folk dance performed in a line, whereas a (dokuz sekiz) rhythm defines the count of the rhythm and is used in both karşilama and Roman havasi. In Lebanon Lebanese style belly dance is somewhere between the Egyptian and Turkish styles. Lebanese dance takes from the classic oriental dance, but still incorporates a feisty, modern edge. There are large steps, backward leans to the torso, twisting hip rotations, large and busy arms and many shimmies. The types of techniques that are used in Lebanese style dance are quick layered shimmies and subtle internal movements. Lebanese dancers sometimes include kicks, splits, deep back bends, and Turkish drops. Outside the Middle East (video) A belly dancer on stage in Japan, 2016Belly dance was popularized in the West during the Romantic movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, when Orientalist artists depicted romanticized images of harem life in the Ottoman Empire. In North America Although there were dancers of this type at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, it was not until the 1893 Chicago World's Fair that it gained national attention. The term \\"belly dancing\\" is often credited to Sol Bloom, the Fair's entertainment director, but he referred to the dance as danse du ventre, the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, \\"when the public learned that the literal translation was \\"belly dance\\", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral ... I had a gold mine.\\" Authentic dancers from several Middle Eastern and North African countries performed at the Fair, including Syria, Turkey and Algeria—but it was the dancers in the Egyptian Theater of The Street in the Cairo exhibit who gained the most notoriety. The fact that the dancers were uncorseted and gyrated their hips was shocking to Victorian sensibilities. There were no soloists, but it is claimed that a dancer nicknamed Little Egypt stole the show. Some claim the dancer was Farida Mazar Spyropoulos, but this fact is disputed.Donna Carlton (1995) Looking for Little Egypt. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. . The popularity of these dancers subsequently spawned dozens of imitators, many of whom claimed to be from the original troupe. Victorian society continued to be affronted by the dance, and dancers were sometimes arrested and fined. The dance was nicknamed the \\"hoochie coochie\\", or the shimmy and shake. A short film, \\"Fatima's Dance\\", was widely distributed in the Nickelodeon theaters. It drew criticism for its \\"immodest\\" dancing, and was eventually censored. Belly dance drew men in droves to burlesque theaters, and to carnival and circus lots. Thomas Edison made several films of dancers in the 1890s. These included a Turkish dance, and Crissie Sheridan in 1897, and Princess Rajah from 1904, which features a dancer playing zills, doing \\"floor work\\", and balancing a chair in her teeth. American tribal fusion dancer Rachel BriceRuth St. Denis also used Middle Eastern-inspired dance in D. W. Griffith's silent film Intolerance, her goal being to lift dance to a respectable art form at a time when dancers were considered to be women of loose morals. Hollywood began producing films such as The Sheik, Cleopatra, and Salomé, to capitalize on Western fantasies of the orient. When immigrants from Arab states began to arrive in New York in the 1930s, dancers started to perform in nightclubs and restaurants. In the late 1960s and early 1970s many dancers began teaching. Middle Eastern or Eastern bands took dancers with them on tour, which helped spark interest in the dance. Although using Turkish and Egyptian movements and music, American Cabaret (\\"AmCab\\") belly dancing has developed its own distinctive style, using props and encouraging audience interaction. In 1987, a distinctively American style of group improvisational dance, American Tribal Style Belly Dance, (ATS), was created. Although a unique and wholly modern style, its steps are based on existing dance techniques, including those from India, the Middle East, and Africa. Many forms of \\"Tribal Fusion\\" belly dance have also developed, incorporating elements from many other dance and music styles including flamenco, ballet, burlesque, hula hoop and even hip hop. \\"Gothic Belly Dance\\" is a style which incorporates elements from Goth subculture. In Spain Dalilah, 1957 Belly dancers are thought to have come to Spain from Lebanon in the time of the Phoenicians (11th Century BC to 5th Century BC). When Arab family of the Umayyad came to Spain, they sent Basque singers and dancers to Damascus and Egypt for training in the Middle Eastern style. These dancers came to be known as Al-Andalus dancers. It is theorised that the fusion of the Al-Andalus style with the dances of the Gypsies led to the creation of flamenco. In Australia The first wave of interest in belly dancing in Australia was during the late 1970s to 1980s with the influx of migrants and refugees escaping troubles in the Middle East, including drummer Jamal Zraika. These immigrants created a social scene including numerous Lebanese and Turkish restaurants, providing employment for belly dancers. Rozeta Ahalyea is widely regarded as the \\"mother\\" of Australian belly dance, training early dance pioneers such as Amera Eid and Terezka Drnzik. Belly dance has now spread across the country, with belly dance communities in every capital city and many regional centres. In the United Kingdom Belly dance has been in evidence in the UK since the early 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a thriving Arabic club scene in London, with live Arabic music and belly dancing a regular feature, but the last of these closed in the early 1990s. Several prominent members of the British belly dance community began their dance careers working in these clubs. Today, there are fewer traditional venues for Arabic dance in the UK; however, there is a large amateur belly dance community. Several international belly dance festivals are now held in Britain such as The International Bellydance Congress, The London Belly Dance Festival and Majma Dance Festival. In addition, there are a growing number of competitions, which have increased in popularity in recent years. The UK belly dance scene leans strongly towards the Egyptian/Arabic style, with little Turkish influence. American Tribal Style and Tribal Fusion belly dance are also popular. Costume The costume most commonly associated with belly dance is the 'bedlah' (; literally \\"suit\\") style, which typically includes a fitted top or bra, a fitted hip belt, and a full-length skirt or harem pants. The bra and belt may be richly decorated with beads, sequins, crystals, coins, beaded fringe and embroidery. The belt may be a separate piece, or sewn into a skirt. Badia Masabni, a Cairo cabaret owner during the early 20th century, is credited with creating the modern bedlah style. It has been suggested that the bedlah was inspired by glamorous Hollywood costuming, or created to appeal to Western visitors. Earlier costumes were made up of a full skirt, light chemise and tight cropped vest with heavy embellishments and jewelry. As well as the two-piece bedlah costume, full-length dresses are sometimes worn, especially when dancing more earthy baladi styles. Dresses range from closely fitting, highly decorated gowns, which often feature heavy embellishments and mesh-covered cutouts, to simpler designs which are often based on traditional clothing. Costume in Egypt In Egypt dancers wear a bedlah. Alternatively, they may wear a dress with mesh-filled cutouts. Egypt has laws in placeRaqs sharqi#Costume regarding what dancers can and cannot wear, and according to Act No. 430 of the law on the censorship of literary works, dancers must cover their lower bodies, including the breast and stomach area. Article in Egypt Today: Egypt's regulations on belly dancing attire Typically a sheer, skin-colored mesh fabric covering the stomach is enough. Many dancers in Cairo ignore these rules, as they are rarely enforced and the consequences for performing with a bare belly may simply be a fine. However, there have been multiple incidents of foreign belly dancers being arrested over their costumes. Costume in Lebanon As there is no prohibition on showing the abdomen in Lebanon, the bedlah style is more common. The skirts tend to be more sheer than Egyptian outfits, showing more of the dancer's body. The veil is more widely used than in Egypt. High heels are commonly worn. Lebanese dancers have more freedom than Egyptian style dancers in the type of costume they choose to wear. Costume in Turkey In Turkey costumes are usually in the bedlah style. Distinctive features of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, and a great deal of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra. In the 1980s and '90s a very revealing costume style developed with skirts designed to display both legs up to the hip, and plunging bras or even pasties. Such styles still exist in some venues but there are also many belly dancers who wear more moderate costumes. Even so, many belly dance costumes reflect the playful, flirty style of belly dance. Tribal style costumes Decorations on a tribal-style bellydance costume braTribal belly dance costumes draw inspiration from traditional folkloric costumes across the globe and include circle skirts, pantaloons, and turbans or headdresses decked with feathers or flowers. Health Belly dance is a non-impact, weight- bearing exercise and is thus suitable for all ages. Many of the moves involve isolations, which improves flexibility of the torso. Belly dance moves are beneficial to the spine, as the full-body undulation moves lengthen (decompress) and strengthen the entire column of spinal and abdominal muscles in a gentle way. Dancing with a veil can help build strength in the upper body, arm and shoulders. Playing the zills trains fingers to work independently and builds strength. The legs and long muscles of the back are strengthened by hip movements.Coluccia, Pina, Anette Paffrath, and Jean Putz. Belly Dancing: The Sensual Art of Energy and Spirit.

The Brazilian telenovela O Clone (also known as El Clon in Spanish-speaking countries and the United States) is set in Brazil and Morocco and featured belly dancing in many episodes. The lead character, Jade (Giovanna Antonelli), used it to entice her lover Lucas (Murilo Benício) and to soothe and seduce her husband Said (Dalton Vigh). Several James Bond films (including From Russia with Love) and music videos have featured belly dancers. In The Man with the Golden Gun, the belly dancer Saida wears a spent bullet in her navel, which Bond accidentally swallows while trying to retrieve it. In addition, Sinbad and the Minotaur featured characters who belly danced such as Luna and Al-Jibbar's Harem slave girls. Documentaries about belly dance include American Bellydancer, Journey of Desire: A Foreign Dancer in Cairo, Belly, Sensual... Scarred... Sacred, and Bellydancers of Cairo. The main heroines from Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet put on a public performance as part of the annual festival with a dance that takes influences from several different kinds of dances, with belly dancing being the most prominent source.

Asthma Dynamic hyperinflation can occur in patients with asthma who are breathing spontaneously. It is a physiologic response to airflow obstruction and exists, to an extent, because increasing lung volume tends to increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing. However, in patients with severe asthma it becomes maladaptive, occurring at the expense of increased mechanical load and elastic work of breathing. Dynamic hyperinflation can cause alveolar overdistention resulting in hypoxemia, hypotension, or alveolar rupture. Dynamic hyperinflation increases the magnitude of the drop in airway pressure that the patient must generate to trigger a breath, thereby increasing the patient's workload. Status asthmaticus Patients with acute severe asthma exacerbation are at risk for progressive air trapping and alveolar hyperinflation, which may lead to alveolar rupture and hemodynamic compromise. Airflow obstruction during expiration slows lung emptying and inspiration may be initiated before exhalation is complete. The phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume is called dynamic hyperinflation. Interventions Interventions to correct air-trapping include decreasing the respiratory rate (increasing expiratory time), increasing inspiratory flow rates (decreasing the inspiratory time) and lowering the tidal volume. Adults In adults, it has been demonstrated that limiting minute ventilation is the key to avoiding dynamic hyperinflation; keeping the minute ventilation under 115/mL/kg is recommended References Category:Respiratory therapy Category:Mechanical ventilation Category:Asthma ","title":"Dynamic hyperinflation"},{"id":"33942410","text":"The following lists classify music and songs by theme Songs about a topic * List of songs about abortion * List of songs about animal rights * List of anti-war songs * List of songs about bicycles * List of car crash songs * List of songs about child abuse * List of songs about the Cold War * List of songs about the environment * List of songs about nuclear war and weapons * List of songs about photography * List of songs about rain * List of songs about school * List of songs about the September 11 attacks * List of songs about the Vietnam War Songs about people * List of songs about Adolf Hitler * Songs that mention Donald Trump * List of songs about or referencing Elvis Presley * List of songs about or referencing Syd Barrett * List of songs about or referencing serial killers Songs about countries or regions * List of songs about California * List of songs about Clare * List of songs about Mexico * List of songs about Ohio * List of songs about Oklahoma * List of songs about Pakistan * List of songs about Puerto Rico * List of songs about Wicklow Songs about a city * List of songs about cities * List of songs about Ahmedabad * List of songs about Alabama * List of songs about Amsterdam * List of songs about Atlanta * List of songs about Bangalore * List of songs about Bareilly * List of songs about Berlin * List of songs about Birmingham * List of songs about Birmingham, Alabama * List of songs about Boston * List of songs about Chennai * List of songs about Chicago * List of songs about Copenhagen * List of songs about Cork * List of songs about Delhi * List of songs about Detroit * List of songs about Dhaka * List of songs about Dubai * List of songs about Dublin * List of songs about Oslo * List of songs about Hamburg * List of songs about Houston * List of songs about Jerusalem * List of songs about Kolkata * List of songs about Liverpool * List of songs about London * List of songs about Los Angeles * List of songs about Louth * List of songs about Lucknow * List of songs about Madras * List of songs about Manchester * List of songs about Manila * List of songs about Melbourne * List of songs about Miami * List of songs about Montreal * List of songs about Moscow * List of songs about Mumbai * List of songs about Nashville, Tennessee * List of songs about New Orleans * List of songs about New York City * List of songs about Paris * List of songs about Portland, Oregon * List of songs about Rio de Janeiro * List of songs about Seattle * List of songs about Stockholm * List of songs about Sydney * List of songs about Tipperary * List of songs about Tokyo * List of songs about Toronto * List of songs about Vancouver See also * Lists of music inspired by literature References * ","title":"Lists of music by theme"},{"id":"33942432","text":"In precision mechanics, fit refers to the degree of 'looseness' with which a shaft is inserted into a bored hole.

White JiveBop Dance Party TV Show is an American dance-based television program created by American Top 40 disc jockey and nightclub operator Alan White. Early life White was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut on October 27, 1941. He is the only child of Ray E. & Doris P. White. During his youth, the family would later relocate to Torrington in northwestern Connecticut. As a youngster, Alan was a student at Rumsey Hall School from 1952 until his graduation in 1956. Musician White dropped out of high school in 1957, and worked various jobs in and around Torrington. In his late teenage years, he also performed in a number of local bands that served the triangle including northwestern Connecticut, Eastern New York state and Western Massachusetts. From 1960 through 1963, Alan drummed for Turk and The Party Cats alongside Turk Coury (vocals & guitar) and Michael 'Mike' Stoffi (guitar). Radio and Nightclub Disc Jockey In 1964, at the age of 24, Alan began working at WHVW AM 950 (known as 'Live 95') in Hyde Park, N.Y. While at WHVW, White did a two-hour daily morning news program, a drive-time show from 4PM until station sign-off, and between shows either sold advertising for the station or worked in the studio to produce ads. While Alan was a disc jockey at WHVW, some students at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. booked him—based on his highly rated afternoon drive show at the local top 40 radio powerhouse Live 95—to DJ a dance at the college promoted under the name 'Discotheque'. The dance was based on the discotheque club concept the students had discovered in Europe the previous summer. This event would become the first known discotheque dance in the United States. That same year, White and a business partner, Bill DeCesare (the WHVW sales manager), opened the first discotheque in the United States, the Rumpus Room Nightclub & Discotheque, in Dover Plains, N.Y. In deejaying professionally from a booth at the club, White unintentionally became the first professional nightclub DJ in America in 1965. Booking Agent From 1966 until 1967, White worked, first as a concert promoter in North Carolina, and later as a theatrical booking agent in Washington, D.C. He served as an agent at Paramount Artists Corporation, and represented (among others): * The British Walkers * Little Willie & the Hand Jives * The Chartbusters * Dee Dee Sharp * The Kalin Twins * Jimmy Jones * The Crystals * The Shangri-Las * Len Barry In late 1967, White departed Paramount in Washington, and moved to Action Talents agency at 1650 Broadway in New York City. Action Talents was an agency that received financing and support from Neil Bogart of Buddah Records fame. While at Action Talents, Alan represented a number of the biggest pop acts of the period, including The Lemon Pipers (Green Tambourine), The Ohio Express (Yummy Yummy Yummy (I've Got Love In My Tummy)), The 1910 Fruitgum Company (Simon Says, 1, 2, 3, Red Light), Joey Dee and the Starliters (Peppermint Twist, Hot Pastrami with Mashed Potatoes), The Music Explosion (Little Bit O'Soul), The Five Stairsteps and Cubie, (O-o-h Child), Johnny Maestro and The Crests (16 Candles, The Angels Listened In, Trouble in Paradise, Step By Step), The Del Satins (a vocal quartet made famous on the local New York City-based Clay Cole Show), Jordan Christopher and The Wild Ones, The Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus and The Peppermint Rainbow (Will You Be Staying After Sunday?). Alan became an integral at Betty Sperber's Action Talents agency, and is said to have coined the name for the act The Brooklyn Bridge; a supergroup merging Johnny Maestro (whom Sperber personally managed), The Crests and The Del Satins. When the band was first introduced to the public, it happened in an appearance on the Brooklyn Bridge featuring the 12-piece band, Bogart, Sperber and the Mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y. The Disco Era Talent Manager In 1969, White moved to Philadelphia to become personal manager and booking agent for his friend, 1960s rock and roll star and former Dovells lead singer Len Barry. At the time, Barry was producing what would become the first two disco records; Who Can I Turn To and a cover of Johnnie Ray's 1950s classic, Cry, both by Atlanta R&B; singer Grover Mitchell. While neither record was a hit, the next Barry-produced dance recording was Keem-O- Sabe by The Electric Indian and that became the first disco record ever to hit the national charts, reaching number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1969. During this period, White managed Barry's career as Len continued to produce new music in addition to performing. His core group of studio musicians at the time included performers like Vince Montana, Daryl Hall, John Oates, Bobby Eli, and Earl Young; some of whom would go on to success either on their own, or as part of groups like MFSB (TSOP), The Trammps (Disco Inferno) and Hall & Oates. Nightclub DJ Eventually, Alan changed directions and returned to radio. From 1972-1973, he served as a sidekick to Peter 'The Flying Dutchman' Berry of Baltimore's WFBR 1300 AM. Berry's morning show on \\"Mad Radio 13\\"—as it was known at the time—consistently dominated the Baltimore market. In addition to working in radio, White also provided marketing and consulting services for restaurants and nightclubs. In 1975, while performing at Emerson's Restaurant in downtown Baltimore, he was presented with a proclamation by then-Mayor William Donald Schaefer naming White \\"The Evening Mayor of Baltimore,\\" in appreciation of his contributions to bringing nighttime business back into Baltimore's downtown. White being presented with proclamation by Baltimore Mayor Schaefer. By 1974, he had also returned to deejaying in nightclubs, and played and programmed music in a variety of nightclubs along the East Coast. He settled in Atlanta, Georgia in 1977 and would perform at several noted Atlanta venues during the heyday of disco, such as Harlows, Jeryl's, and Johnny's Hideaway. Alan White would receive a gold record for his promotional efforts which helped nationally break Jim Burgess's 12\\" remix of Alicia Bridges' I Love the Nightlife in 1978. In the early 1980s, he would record a couple of novelty records. However, White continued to enjoy performing in nightclubs and would settle into a position as music director and headline DJ at Atlanta's Johnny's Hideaway. He would serve there in this capacity until the mid-1990s. The Swing Revival In 1998, White began to DJ and promote dance events for young Atlanta-area swing dancers, who had become caught up in a resurgence of interest in swing music and dancing which would later come to be known as the swing revival or the Neo-Swing movement. This trend was led musically by artists like Brian Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Squirrel Nut Zippers and Indigo Swing. In 2001, Alan—along with web designer Dr. Clio Soleil—launched an internet radio station called SwingTop40.com, which featured a weekly Top 40 countdown show, with songs voted upon by reporting swing DJs from around the world. In 2002, SwingTop40 would partner with SwingAwards.com to digitally produce the first of two 'imaginary' special broadcasts that served as a formal awards program for the swing music industry. When SwingTop40 ceased production in April 2003, a total of 103 weekly Swing Top 40 Countdown shows had been broadcast, and are currently archived online. These archived programs serve as a detailed historic record of the swing music revival of the late 1990s and early 2000s. On Memorial Day weekend of 2005, Alan White was inducted into the Swing DJs Hall of Fame. White being inducted into the Swing DJs Hall of Fame in 2005. Present Day Alan currently lives in Chamblee, Georgia and continues to DJ and promote dance events in the Atlanta area. Mr. White is divorced, and the father of two sons: Zachary and Alan White, Jr. He also presently runs a Modern Jive dance promotion company called JiveBop and a related internet radio station—JiveBopRadio.com—playing music optimized for Modern Jive dancers. A television dance party show called the JiveBop Dance Party TV Show is currently in pre-production.

Life  He was a son of Count Philip II of Waldeck- Eisenberg and his first wife, Catherine of Solms-Lich, and succeeded his father in 1524 as Count of Waldeck-Eisenberg. Around 1520 he built a residential wing of the later Goldhausen Castle in Korbach. Further expansion took place between 1563 and 1565, under his son Wolrad II. In 1525, soon after he took office, he issued an order to introduce the Reformation in 1525 in Waldeck. Philip III and his nephew Count Philip IV of Waldeck-Wildungen appointed the Lutheran reformer Johann Hefentreger as pastor of the town of Waldeck. Johann gave his inaugural sermon on 17 June 1526. On 26 June 1526, he led a Lutheran church service, thereby officially introducing the Reformation in the county, four months before Landgrave Philip I introduced the Reformation in neighbouring Hesse. In 1529, the first Lutheran sermon was given in the St. Kilian Church in Korbach; he is portrait on the altar as its donor. Philip could not, however, push through the Reformation in Korbach. Between 1526 and 1530, Philip acquired the secularized former Aroldessen monastery of the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony in Bad Arolsen and had it rebuilt to a Royal Palace. He employed Johann von Wolmeringhausen as his Hofmeister and, after 1530, Johann's son Hermann von Wolmeringhausen. Philip III died on 20 June 1539. After his death, Waldeck-Eisenberg was divided. His older son Wolrad II received a smaller Waldeck-Eisenberg; his younger son John received Waldeck-Landau.  Marriages and issue  In 1503, Philip married his first wife, Adelheid (d. 1515), a daughter of Count Otto IV of Hoya. From this marriage, Philip had four children: * Otto (1504-1541) * Elizabeth (1506-1562), married in 1525 Jean de Melun, Viscount of Ghent * Wolrad II, founder of the so-called \\"middle Waldeck-Eisenberg line\\" * Erika (1511-1560), 1526, married Eberhard of Mark, Duke of Arenberg, then secondly, in 1532, Count Dietrich V of Manderscheid-Virneburg. In 1519, he married his second wife. She was Anne of Cleves (1495-1567), the only daughter of the Duke John II of Cleves and Matilda of Hesse-Marburg. Her brother had held her imprisoned from 1517 to 1519 to prevent the marriage. From this marriage, Philip had four more children: * Philip V (born: 1519 or 1520; died: 1584), who joined the clergy * John I (born: 1521 or 1522; died: 1567), founder of the \\"newer Waldeck-Landau line\\", which became extinct in 1597 * Catherine (born: 1523 or 1524-1583), married in 1550 with Count Bernhard VIII of Lippe * Francis (1526-1574), married in 1563 with Maria Gogreve (died: 1580)  External links  * Goldhausen Castle at Mount Eisenberg * Official website of Arolsen Castle Category:Counts of Waldeck Category:1486 births Category:1539 deaths Category:16th-century German people ","title":"Philip III, Count of Waldeck"},{"id":"33942671","text":"Ivica Milutinović (Serbian Cyrillic: Ивица Милутиновић ;born October 20, 1983 in Kosovska Mitrovica) is a Serbian footballer who plays for BSK Borča in the Serbian First League.

Geography and history Azov Governorate was located in the northeastern Azov littoral region and covered only the southern half of the previously existing Azov Governorate of 1708-25. The new division was created from the southern Bakhmut Province of Voronezh Governorate and the self- governed frontier region of Slavo-Serbia, but primarily it was based on the recently created and quickly liquidated lands of the Don Host. Some of the lands of the Azov Governorate had been acquired by Russia from the Ottoman Empire per the terms of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (signed in 1774) that were lost in 1711 due to the Pruth River Campaign in the Romanian region. In terms of the modern administrative division of Russia, the southern part of Rostov Oblast was part of the second Azov Governorate.Сергей Тархов. \\"Изменение административно-территориального деления России в XIII-XX вв.\\". \\"Логос\\", 2005, №1.

Gudde, William Bright, California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names, University of California Press, 2004, p. 142 is a creek in Fresno County, California. Its source is in Zapato Chino Canyon on the east slope of Mustang Peak in the Diablo Range. From there it runs northwest through Zapato Chino Canyon, in the Krayenhagen Hills, then passed across Pleasant Valley to the Guijarral Hills, then east through the Polvadero Gap, then runs northeast to its confluence with Los Gatos Creek. It usually dissipates in the San Joaquin Valley, 11 miles east of Coalinga. However it reaches Los Gatos Creek in years of heavy rainfall. History Zapato Chino Creek, originally was known by two names, Arroyo de Las Polvarduras (Creek of the Dust Clouds), and Arroyo de Zapata Chino (Chinese Shoe Creek), it was the location of watering places on El Camino Viejo, between Jacalitos Creek to the north and Canoas Creek to the south. William N. Abeloe, Mildred Brooke Hoover, H. E. Rensch, E. G. Rensch, Historic spots in California, 3rd Edition, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1966, p. 89 What is now called Zapato Chino Creek below its emergence from the Canyon was called Pulvero Creek in a 1907 Fresno County, Township map, of Range 16 East. Page 061, Atlas: Fresno County 1907, State: California, William Harvey, Sr., 1907 Fresno County, Township map, Range 16 East Pulvero seems to be a corruption of the Spanish, polvero, which means \\"dust cloud\\". According to the 1913, Gazetteer of Surface waters, California, in San Joaquin River Basin: :\\"Polvadero Creek (L); Fresno County; rises in the northern part of T. 24 S., R. 15 E.; flows northeastward 18 miles into San Joaquin Valley; sinks before reaching Los Gatos Creek, to which its basin is topographically tributary; called Zapatos Creek in the upper part of its course. Fisk and Johnson map.\\" B. D. Wood, Gazetteer of Surface waters, California, in San Joaquin River Basin, U.S. G.P.O., 1913, p.69 The Fisk and Johnson Map referred to above, is the Manuscript map of San Joaquin Valley compiled by A. J. Fisk, Jr., and H. R. Johnson, in 1866.Wood, Gazetteer of Surface waters, p.3 Polvadero again may be a corruption of the Spanish, polvareda meaning \\"cloud of dust\\". It may be that at the time that the Spanish or Californio persons originally named Zapato Chino Creek, Canoas Creek joined Zapato Chino Creek near its place of emergence from its Canyon. They would have considered Zapato Chino Creek to end at this confluence with Canoas Creek. Then from this confluence the creek would then have the name of Arroyo de Las Polvarduras, passing through the Polvadero Gap and on until its confluence with Los Gatos Creek (Arroyo Pasajero or Arroyo Poso de Chane). Subsequently, Canoas Creek or Zapato Chino Creek must have changed their courses over time away from this confluence, into the separate channels they have today according to current maps and probably at the time in 1908 when official names were assigned. The channels where they are now are not far apart in the area of the possible former confluence. The location between the Guijarral Hills and the Kettleman Hills where Arroyo de Las Polvarduras ran is still officially called the Polvadero Gap with Polvadera Gap as a recognized variant. Strangely the GNIS Board Decision in 1908 was to name the whole length of the creek, Zapato Creek, apparently ignorant of local usage of Polvarderas, Polvadero or Pulvero or maybe ignoring it altogether as they do not appear on the decision card. In 1964 the name was changed Zapato Creek to Zapato Chino Creek all the way to its confluence with Los Gatos Creek.

The films focus on the \\"single-payer\\" system as seen in Canada, the likes of which has been advocated by other filmmakers, like Michael Moore in his film Sicko. Purpose The series is meant to offer examples of cautionary tales which give cause to question the nature of the effectiveness of socialized medicine, particularly for individuals in the United States, whose government is gradually taking steps towards socializing medicine. Content Uninsured in America This film challenges what the filmmaker calls the \\"myth\\" of the suffering uninsured in America. The film gives several pieces of evidence to support its claims. The film claims that according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2007 data, 17 million (38%) of the approximately 45 million uninsured people in the U.S. live in households that have incomes greater than $50,000 per year, an amount that Devon Herrick of the National Center for Policy Analysis asserts is high enough that one could reasonably assume that the members of such a household should be able to afford some degree of health insurance coverage. Furthermore, 9 million (20%) of the uninsured, make more than $75,000 per year. Additional demographics that make up a significant portion of the uninsured are the 18 million 18- to 34-year-olds that the film refers to as the \\"young invincibles\\", who spend four times as much money on alcohol, tobacco, entertainment, and dining out as on out-of-pocket healthcare, as well as the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. that the film asserts receive healthcare without being insured. In addition to the undocumented immigrants, citizens of other nations can request \\"compassionate entry\\" at the U.S. border, and be picked up by American ambulances and taken to American hospitals to receive treatment. Herrick later says that uninsured people in the United States tend to receive 50-60% of the amount of care that insured people do. He says that, effectively, the country is disincentivizing people from paying for their health insurance. Two Women The short follows a Canadian woman named Janice Fraser, who suffers from a bladder disease that has caused her bladder to be incapable of functioning properly, leading to near constant pain, frequent infections and accompanying high fevers. Janice needed an operation to insert an electrical implant which would stimulate her bladder to function. However, the Canadian specialist that consulted her explained that he was only allowed to perform 12 such operations per year, and that Janice was number 32 on the list and would likely have to wait nearly 3 years for the operation. Janice and her mother offered to pay for the procedure to get it done more quickly, but were turned downed, as this is against Canadian law in the single-payer system. They received little help from their parliamentary representative, nor from George Smitherman, the Ontario Minister of Health, who the film describes as the \\"ultimate healthcare gatekeeper for the 12.5 million citizens of Ontario.\\" Meanwhile, Susan Gapka, a male-to-female transsexual, was able to enlist the help of Smitherman and the government in paying for her sex change operation. While she waited for her implant, Janice's constant infections eventually worsened to the point that necessitated the removal of her bladder completely in order to save her life. A Short Course in Brain Surgery Lindsay McCreith is a Canadian man who began having serious headaches and eventually suffered a seizure in January 2006. His doctor suspected a brain tumor may be the cause, and recommended that Mr. McCreith get an MRI, but was told that he would have to wait 4 months to get one. Instead of waiting, private medical broker Rick Baker of Timely Medical Alternatives directed McCreith to get an MRI done in the U.S.; he was able to obtain an MRI in Buffalo, NY one day later, and learned that he did indeed have a golf ball-sized mass in his brain. He proceeded with his medical treatments in the U.S. instead of waiting for it in Canada. Baker says that they were able to compress the entire process, from MRI to consultation to biopsy to surgery to 4.5 weeks, and estimated that McCreith might have waited as long as 8 months in Canada - a potentially life-threateningly long wait. McCreith attempted to gain reimbursement from the Canadian government of the $28,000 of medical expenses, but was denied because he didn't have the proper permission from the Canadian government to seek treatment abroad, a process of applications and appeals that can last 8 months. Baker goes on to state that he is weary of the attempts by some Americans to duplicate the Canadian single-payer healthcare system, saying, \\"where will I send my clients...you people will be waiting two and three years for surgery, I'll have nowhere to send Canadians.\\" The Lemon The Lemon draws parallels between collectivized healthcare systems and the East German Trabant, a noisy, inefficient, underpowered automobile that remained a symbol of communist inefficiency and lack of ingenuity, mostly unchanged for nearly thirty years. East Germans would typically have to wait 8 years to receive their own Trabant, an unappealing vehicle that lacked even basic features, like fuel gauges. Like East Germans waiting for their Trabants, the movie implies, so too do Canadians like Shirley Healey wait for life-saving treatment. Ms. Healey suffered from mesenteric ischemia, and was unable to obtain prompt treatment, being told she'd have to wait about 2 months. Her doctor, Robert W. Ellett, M.D., having seen another patient with the same condition die after waiting 3 months, urged Ms. Healey to seek medical treatment in the U.S. Dr. Ellett explained that while there were a sufficient number of rooms in the local ICU near her in British Columbia to receive her and other patients after surgery, many of them sit empty, because \\"they're not funded rooms.\\" Ms. Healey did pay for her operation in Washington, and doctors there found that her artery was nearly completely blocked, a life-threatening condition that would have caused her intestines to perfuse inadequately, leading her to, in essence, starve to death.

It is a prequel to the story of Peter Pan. Plot Part 1 In London, England 1906, arch crook and ace fencer James \\"Jimmy\\" Hook (Rhys Ifans) assembles a gang of juvenile street thieves, including Peter (Charlie Rowe). Jimmy proposes the risky job robbing of Harbottle's Jewelry and Antiques, which he has been hired to rob. However, after seeing Peter's over-eagerness and the hesitancy of the other boys, he changes his mind and decides to do the job alone. Determined to prove himself to Jimmy, Peter talks the other boys into attempting the heist, neglecting to mention that Jimmy had explicitly told him not to. The boys successfully break in, and are looting the place when Jimmy arrives. Upset with Peter, but determined to get what he came for, Jimmy sets Peter as a lookout in the front of the shop, taking the other boys into the back to search. Jimmy finds what he was hired to steal: a strange glowing orb. While gazing into it, he is startled by the image of a crocodile. Jimmy falls off the stool he was standing on, and the orb falls to the ground. There is a flash of light, encompassing Jimmy and all of the boys with him. Peter, still in the front room, sees the light and discovers that Jimmy, the boys, and part of the building have vanished. Believing it was a bomb and his friends are dead, Peter takes the orb and returns home. A man arrives asking for Jimmy, and Peter decides to follow him, hoping to get information about why Jimmy was hired to steal the orb. He is caught, and introduced to Dr. Richard Fludd. Dr. Fludd explains that the orb is a portal that is activated by impact, and that Jimmy and the boys are not dead, but have been transported to another world. Peter escapes and returns home, where he hits the orb, determined to find his friends and bring them home. Immediately after Peter vanishes, Dr. Fludd arrives and finds the orb. Meanwhile, Jimmy and the boys find themselves in a strange land and are quickly captured by a band of pirates, led by Captain Elizabeth Bonny (Anna Friel). The pirates discovered the orb in the 1700s, and were transported to this world. They have not aged since they arrived. The captain decides that Jimmy is useless and tries to have him thrown to the giant ten-legged crocodiles. However, Jimmy manages to fight off the crew. Having earned their respect, Jimmy is allowed to stay, and the boys are locked up. Bonny shows Jimmy magical dust that comes from the fairy-like race (called \\"tree spirits\\") that live on the island. The dust gives the power of flight, but she only has a small vial and does not have the knowledge to use it properly. She explains that the tree spirit colony lies in a forest beyond an impassable mountain range, protected by a lost Kaw tribe. Jimmy agrees to help the pirates. Peter finds himself in the middle of a strange forest, and is reunited with Fox, who managed to avoid being captured. They see a large swarm of tree spirits flying towards them. Running away, they stumble upon a group of Kaw hunters. They are blindfolded, and led to the Native village via a secret pass through the mountains. The boys make friends with the Natives and meet the chief's daughter, Princess Aaya/Tiger Lily (Q'orianka Kilcher). They learn that the natives protect the tree spirit colony from the pirates, who do not know how to navigate the land. Because the pirates are dangerous and possibly insane, Peter and Fox are not allowed to leave for fear they will be captured and tortured into giving up the tribe's secrets. Peter and Fox sneak away from the tribe, and then steal a canoe to rescue their friends from the pirates. Fox and Peter manage to get the boys off of the ship, but Peter goes back for Jimmy, against the other boys' advice. He finds Jimmy in the Captain's quarters with Elizabeth, and tries to get him to leave. However, Jimmy refuses and tries to convince Peter that they aren't dangerous. Peter is taken into custody on Captain Bonny's orders, but Fox, who followed Peter, creates a diversion and Peter escapes the ship. Before Fox can follow, one of the pirates attempts to stab Hook, who dodges. Peter and the boys watch in dismay as Fox is stabbed instead, and he falls overboard. Upon returning to the Native village, the boys blame Peter for Fox's death and for being trapped in this place, since he lied to them about the heist. While playing his flute alone, a tribal elder arrives and informs Peter that the tune is of the Tree Spirits. He then shows Peter a simple painting depicting a scene from a dream they've both had. Aaya arrives and recognizes the mountain in the painting as a place near their hunting grounds, called 'Bull Mountain'. The Elder hypothesizes that people who hit the orb have a stronger connection with this world than others, which is why they have the dreams. Peter decides to find the place, hoping to discover the hooded man in the dream and a way to return to London. Hook and Captain Bonny follow Peter & Aaya hoping to be led to the tree spirit colony. While stopping for the night, Peter again plays the melody on his flute, and a tree spirit approaches him. The song is the sound that their wings make in flight. When Peter stops playing, she flies away and Peter and Aaya follow her. However, morning arrives making it too bright to see her. But as the sun comes up, they discover that they have been led to the base of a giant wall made of entwining trees. They decide to search within, sure that the hooded man will be there. On the other side, they find a city made from entwined tress. They are approached by the hooded man, who reveals himself to be Dr. Richard Fludd (Charles Dance), the royal alchemist for Queen Elizabeth I. He leads them back to his laboratory, and explains that he discovered a planet which exists, paradoxically, at the edges and center of the universe simultaneously. Due to the strange nature of its position, time stands still. He created the orb as a way of transporting people to the planet, which is, of course, Neverland. However, on his 1st trip, he was stuck in Neverland, since the orb remains on Earth. He finally managed to create a sister orb that allowed him to leave Neverland. He activated it in Neverland with the power of 2 meteors, an event which imprints on everyone who actives the orb, causing the dreams. The tree spirit thought that Fludd was in danger as he harnessed the energy, and tried to save him, which imbued her with \\"astral energy\\". Fludd named the spirit Tinker Bell, due to the sound of her wings. He built the city as a Utopia where all the greatest scientific and artistic minds on Earth can live. While they plot a way to return Peter and the boys back to London, they are interrupted by Jimmy, Bonny, and several pirates who enter the city, having followed Peter and Aaya. Peter and Aaya remain out of sight while Fludd tries to intimidate the pirates using illusions. Instead of leaving, the pirates begin to shoot at the illusions, setting fire to the tree city. As they leave the building, Hook spots Peter and follows him and Fludd. Fludd tells Peter to keep the orb safe, and then turns back to stop the pirates. Fludd refuses to tell Captain Elizabeth where the orb is, so she shoots and kills him. Hook catches up to Peter in the laboratory, and tries to persuade him join him. After a brief duel, Hook pins Peter to the floor and tells him that he knew Peter's mother. He shows Peter her picture in his pocket watch, and tells him that he promised her to keep Peter safe. Jimmy says that the pocket watch originally belonged to Peter's father. Before he can explain any further, Captain Bonny and her crew arrive. Bonny finds the orb. Peter escapes to the balcony, where he is disarmed and held at sword point. As he is about to be stabbed by Captain Bonny, Aaya appears and tells them that she will tell them how to find the tree spirits, as long as they set Peter free. Peter breaks free, and runs toward Aaya, but Captain Bonny stabs him and he falls off of the balcony. The pirates leave, taking Aaya prisoner. Peter is shown on the ground, supposedly dead. Part 2 The pirates return to the ship, and Jimmy vows to get the power of flight before he returns to England. Meanwhile, Peter is brought to the tree spirit colony by Tinker Bell. He is healed, and immersed in a pool filled with the mineral dust, emerging with the ability to fly. The spirit elders tell him that he was recognized for his innocence, and he must use his new powers to stop Jimmy and bring the orb to the tree spirits. Jimmy persuades the captain to risk traversing a ravine protected by the Natives, with Aaya as hostage. Halfway across, Peter cuts Aaya loose and flies her to safety. Peter confronts Jimmy and threatens Bonny to learn the orb's location. But a giant spider attacks, and Peter is incapacitated and captured by the pirates. Back on the ship, Bonny tells Jimmy their alliance is over, since all of his plans have failed. Jimmy escapes the ship with Peter. Seemingly changed, he tells Peter he wants to go back to London with him and the boys. He persuades Peter to show him the mountain passage so they can be reunited with the gang. But once they reach the passage, Jimmy betrays Peter and reveals that the pirates followed them. Jimmy promises Peter that if he takes them to the Tree Spirit colony and helps them get the Mineral, they will leave forever. Peter agrees. Upon arriving at the Tree Spirit colony, the pirates begin burning it to prevent the spirits from interfering. Just wanting the pirates leave, he shows them the mineral pool. Following Peter's instructions, Bonnie immerses herself in the mineral dust. It appears to have worked, and she starts floating. But she quickly burns to death, since she lacked innocence. Angry at yet another failure, Jimmy angrily tells Peter he killed his father for stealing Peter's mother from him. The Indians arrive and attack the pirates and Peter manages to escape in the chaos. The tree spirits, angry that Peter lead Jimmy to them, try to erase Peter's memory so that the only thing left will be his childlike innocence. They are interrupted by Tinker Bell, who releases her astral energy on them. Now ostracized from her people, Tinker Bell soon realises that Peter has lost much of his memory. He is found by the Natives, who are also angry for his betrayal, and lock him in a pit. Meanwhile, the Lost Boys begin bonding with the Native Tribe. They are still angry with Peter, especially Curly, who thinks that he has what it takes to replace Peter as leader. However, he freezes in fear while on a Crocodile hunt, and is saved by a native. He begins to realize that he doesn't have what it takes to be a leader. They decide to rescue Peter from captivity and remain loyal to each other. They free Peter but he doesn't remember them. They try to remind him, but nothing works until Curly plays the gang's signal song on Peter's flute. With his memory back, Tinker Bell and Peter follow the pirates in the hopes of finding the orb. However, they discover that Jimmy, now known as Captain Hook, intends to bring back modern weapons to destroy the Indians. Peter warns Aaya, who does not believe him, so he returns to try to stop the pirates alone. Meanwhile, Aaya speaks to the Lost Boys and realizes that Peter was telling the truth. She and the boys manage to convince the Indians to help stop Hook. Peter follows Hook to the orb, while the Indians arrive and fight the pirates. Before Hook can activate the orb, Peter intervenes. Peter duels with Hook, while Aaya leads the Lost Boys against the pirates. While fighting, Tinker Bell is badly injured. Peter inadvertently cuts off Hook's right hand, then demands his father's watch. Hook throws the watch at Peter, knocking him unconscious. Both the hand and the watch fall off the cliff, and are swallowed by a giant crocodile. Pirates try to activate the orb, but Tinker Bell uses her astral energy to stop them, which causes the cave to crumble. Aaya and the boys quickly escape. Peter reawakens and finds the orb and Tinker Bell (who has somehow fallen back unconscious), but he is unable to escape before the cave collapses. Some time later, the boys are living with the Natives when they are surprised to see Peter reappear, dressed in a suit and accompanied by Tinker Bell. He tells them that he managed to activate the orb before the cave collapsed, returning to London. He stole the London orb, and hid it so no one else can use it, before activating it one last time to return to Neverland. They ask why he came back, since both orbs are lost and there is no way back to Earth. He tells them that there is adventure everywhere in this land. Curly suddenly points out to Peter that his shadow is missing, thus leading into the events of the Original Peter Pan.

Regulation History Until the 1990s, Europe's regulation was less strict than in the United States, one turning point being cited as the export of the United States' first GM- containing soy harvest in 1996. The GM soy made up about 2% of the total harvest at the time, and Eurocommerce and European food retailers required that it be separated.Lynch D, Vogel D. (2001). The Regulation of Gmos in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory Politics.. In 1998, the use of MON810, a Bt expressing maize conferring resistance to the European corn borer, was approved for commercial cultivation in Europe. Shortly thereafter, the EU enacted a de facto moratorium on new approvals of GMOs pending new regulatory laws passed in 2003. Those new laws provided the European Union (EU) with possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world. The European Food Safety Authority was created in 2002 with the primary goal of preventing future food crises in Europe. All GMOs, along with irradiated food, are considered \\"new food\\" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: \\"safety\\", \\"freedom of choice\\", \\"labelling\\" and \\"traceability\\". The EFSA reports to the European Commission (EC), which then drafts a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health; if accepted, it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the Council of Agricultural Ministers. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal; if no majority is reached, the proposal is passed back to the EC, which will then adopt the proposal. However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are \\"justifiable reasons\\" that the variety might cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case. The Commission is obliged to investigate these cases and either overturn the original registrations or request the country to withdraw its temporary restriction. The laws of the EU also required that member nations establish coexistence regulations. In many cases, national coexistence regulations include minimum distances between fields of GM crops and non-GM crops. The distances for GM maize from non-GM maize for the six largest biotechnology countries are: France – 50 meters, Britain – 110 meters for grain maize and 80 for silage maize, Netherlands – 25 meters in general and 250 for organic or GM-free fields, Sweden – 15–50 meters, Finland – data not available, and Germany – 150 meters and 300 from organic fields. Larger minimum distance requirements discriminate against adoption of GM crops by smaller farms. In 2006, the World Trade Organization concluded that the EU moratorium, which had been in effect from 1999 to 2004, had violated international trade rules. The moratorium had not affected previously approved crops. The only crop authorised for cultivation before the moratorium was Monsanto's MON 810. The next approval for cultivation was the Amflora potato for industrial applications in 2010 which was grown in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic that year. The slow pace of approval has been criticized as endangering European food safety although as of 2012, the EU has authorized the use of 48 genetically modified organisms. Most of these were for use in animal feed (it was reported in 2012 that the EU imports about 30 million tons a year of GM crops for animal consumption.), food or food additives. 26 of these were varieties of maize.Staff EU register of genetically modified food and feed European Commission, Health and Consumers, EU register of authorised GMOs, Retrieved 15 August 2012 In July 2012 the EU gave approval for an Irish trial cultivation of potatoes resistant to the blight that caused the Great Irish Famine. The safeguard clause mentioned above has been applied by many member states in various circumstances, and in April 2011 there were 22 active bans in place across six member states: Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Greece, and Hungary. However, on review many of these have been considered scientifically unjustified. *In January 2005, the Hungarian government announced a ban on importing and planting of genetic modified maize seeds, which was subsequently authorized by the EU. *In February 2008 the French government used the safeguard clause to ban the cultivation of MON810 after Senator Jean-François Le Grand, chairman of a committee set up to evaluate biotechnology, said there were \\"serious doubts\\" about the safety of the product (although this ban was declared illegal in 2011 by the European Court of Justice and the French Conseil d'État). The French farm ministry reinstated the ban in 2012, but this was rejected by the EFSA.\\"French ban of Monsanto GM maize rejected by EU.\\" Link. Published 22 May 2012, retrieved 28 July 2012. *In 2009 German Federal Minister Ilse Aigner announced an immediate halt to cultivation and marketing of MON810 maize under the safeguard clause. *In March 2010, Bulgaria imposed a complete ban on genetically modified crop growing either commercially or for trials. The cabinet of Boyko Borisov initially imposed a 5-year moratorium, but later extended it to a permanent ban after widespread public protests against the introduction of genetically modified crops in the country. And in recent years, France and several other European countries banned cultivation of Monsanto's MON-810 corn and similar genetically modified food crops. * In January 2013, Poland's government placed a ban on Monsanto's GM corn, MON 810. It launched a communication campaign with farmers, announcing they will now be strictly monitoring farms for GM corn crops. Poland is the eighth EU member to ban the production of GMOs even though they have been approved by European Food Safety Authority. Europe is not officially against the use of GM crops when it comes to laboratory research, and they are working to regulate the field. In 2012, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) released a \\"Scientific opinion addressing the safety assessment of plants developed through cisgenesis and intragenesis\\" in a response to a request from the European Commission. The opinion was, that while \\"the frequency of unintended changes may differ between breeding techniques and their occurrence cannot be predicted and needs to be assessed case by case,\\" \\"similar hazards can be associated with cisgenic and conventionally bred plants, while novel hazards can be associated with intragenic and transgenic plants.\\" In other words, cisgenic approaches, which introduce genes from the same species, should be considered similar in risk to conventional breeding approaches, whilst transgenic plants can come with new hazards. In 2014 a panel of experts set up by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council argued that \\"A regulatory system based on the characteristics of a novel crop, by whatever method it has been produced, would provide a more effective and robust regulation than current EU processes , which consider new crop varieties differently depending on the method used to produce them.\\" They said that new forms of \\"genome editing\\" allow targeting specific sites and making precise changes in the DNA of crops. In the future it would become increasingly difficult if not impossible to tell which method has been used (conventional breeding or genetic engineering) to produce a novel crop. They proposed that existing EU regulatory system should be replaced with a more logical system like that used for new medicines.(27 October 2014) Europe must lift GM food limits to help feed planet, say experts The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 28 October 2014 In 2015 Germany, Poland, France, Scotland and several other member states opted out of cultivating GMO crops in their territory. A Eurobarometer survey has indicated that \\"level of concern\\" about genetically engineered food in Europe has decreased significantly, from 69% in 2010 to 27% in 2019. Labeling and traceability The regulations concerning the import and sale of GMOs for human and animal consumption grown outside the EU involve providing freedom of choice to the farmers and consumers. All food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labeled. Twice GMOs unapproved by the EC have arrived in the EU and been forced to return to their port of origin. The first was in 2006 when a shipment of rice from America containing an experimental GMO variety (LLRice601) not meant for commercialisation arrived at Rotterdam. The second in 2009 when trace amounts of a GMO maize approved in the US were found in a \\"non-GM\\" soy flour cargo. The coexistence of GM and non-GM crops has raised significant concern in many European countries and so EU law also requires that all GM food be traceable to its origin, and that all food with GM content greater than 0.9% be labelled. Due to high demand from European consumers for freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods. EU regulations require measures to avoid mixing of foods and feed produced from GM crops and conventional or organic crops, which can be done via isolation distances or biological containment strategies. (Unlike the US, European countries require labeling of GM food.) European research programs such as Co- Extra, Transcontainer, and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for traceability. The OECD has introduced a \\"unique identifier\\" which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing. Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them. The EC has issued guidelines to allow the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown). These are regulated by individual countries and vary from 15 meters in Sweden to 800 meters in Luxembourg. All food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled. Scope In its regulations the European Union considers genetically modified organisms only to be food and feed for all intents and practical purposes,European Commission Fact Sheet: Questions and Answers on EU's policies on GMOs Press release Database, 22 April 2015, retrieved 25 October 2015 in difference to the definition of genetically modified organisms which encompasses animals. Approach The EU uses the precautionary principle demanding a pre-market authorisation for any GMO to enter the market and a post-market environmental monitoring. Both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the member states author a risk assessment. This assessment must show that the food or feed is safe for human and animal health and the environment \\"under its intended conditions of use\\". As of 2010, the EU treats all genetically modified crops (GMO crops), along with irradiated food as \\"new food\\". They are subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). This agency reports to the European Commission, which then drafts proposals for granting or refusing authorisation. Each proposal is submitted to the \\"Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health\\". If accepted, it is either adopted by the EC or passed on to the Council of Agricultural Ministers. The Council has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal. If no majority is reached, the proposal is passed back to the EC, which then adopts the proposal. The EFSA uses independent scientific research to advise the European Commission on how to regulate different foods in order to protect consumers and the environment. For GMOs, the EFSA's risk assessment includes molecular characterization, potential toxicity and potential environmental impact. Each GMO must be reassessed every 10 years. In addition, applicants who wish to cultivate or process GMOs must provide a detailed surveillance plan for after authorization. This ensures that the EFSA will know if risk to consumers or the environment heightens and that they can then act to lowed the risk or deauthorize the GMO. , 49 GMO crops, consisting of eight GM cottons, 28 GM maizes, three GM oilseed rapes, seven GM soybeans, one GM sugar beet, one GM bacterial biomass, and one GM yeast biomass have been authorised.Staff EU register of genetically modified food and feed European Commission, Health and Consumers, EU register of authorised GMOs, Retrieved 30 September 2014  Review of authorisation Member States may invoke a safeguard clause to temporarily restrict or prohibit use and/or sale of a GMO crop within their territory if they have justifiable reasons to consider that an approved GMO crop may be a risk to human health or the environment. The EC is obliged to investigate and either overturn the original registrations or ask the country to withdraw its temporary restriction. By 2012, seven countries had submitted safeguard clauses. The EC investigated and rejected those from six countries (\\"...the scientific evidence currently available did not invalidate the original risk assessments for the products in question...\\") and one, the UK, withdrew. Import rules The EC Directorate-general for agriculture and rural development states that the regulations concerning the import and sale of GMOs for human and animal consumption grown outside the EU provide freedom of choice to farmers and consumers. All food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled. As of 2010 GMOs unapproved by the EC had been found twice and returned to their port of origin: First in 2006 when a shipment of rice from the U.S. containing an experimental GMO variety (LLRice601) not meant for commercialisation arrived at Rotterdam, the second time in 2009, when trace amounts of a GMO maize approved in the US were found in a non-GM soy flour cargo. In 2012, the EU imported about 30 million tons of GM crops for animal consumption. Adoption of GMO crops Spain has been the largest producer of GM crops in Europe with of GM maize planted in 2013 equaling 20% of Spain's maize production. Smaller amounts were produced in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Portugal, Romania and Poland. France and Germany are the major opponents of genetically modified food in Europe, although Germany has approved Amflora a potato modified with higher levels of starch for industrial purposes. In addition to France and Germany, other European countries that placed bans on the cultivation and sale of GMOs include Austria, Hungary, Greece, and Luxembourg. Poland has also tried to institute a ban, with backlash from the European Commission. Bulgaria effectively banned cultivation of genetically modified organisms on 18 March 2010. In 2010, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia and the Netherlands wrote a joint paper requesting that individual countries should have the right to decide whether to cultivate GM crops. By the year 2010, the only GMO food crop with approval for cultivation in Europe was MON 810, a Bt expressing maize conferring resistance to the European corn borer that gained approval in 1998. Amflora potato field in Zepkow, Germany. In March 2010 a second GMO, a potato called Amflora, was approved for cultivation for industrial applications in the EU by the European Commission and was grown in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic that year. Amflora was withdrawn from the EU market in 2012, and in 2013 its approval was annulled by an EU court. Fearing that gene flow could occur between related crops, the EC issued new guidelines in 2010 regarding the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops. Co-existence is regulated by the use of buffer zones and isolation distances between the GM and non-GM crops. The guidelines are not binding and each Member State can implement its own regulations, which has resulted in buffer zones ranging from 15 metres (Sweden) to 800 metres (Luxembourg). Member States may also designate GM-free zones, effectively allowing them to ban cultivation of GM crops in their territory without invoking a safeguard clause. Implementation in the Member States and in Switzerland Bulgaria In October 2015, Bulgaria announced it has opted out of growing genetically modified crops, effectively banning the cultivation of different types of GMO corn and soybeans. France France adopted the EU laws on growing GMOs in 2007 and was fined €10 million by the European Court of Justice for the six-year delay in implementing the laws. In February 2008, the French government used the safeguard clause to ban the cultivation of MON 810 after Senator Jean-François Le Grand, chairman of a committee to evaluate biotechnology, said there were \\"serious doubts\\" about the safety of the product. Twelve scientists and two economists on the committee accused Le Grand of misrepresenting the report and said they did not have \\"serious doubts\\", although questions remained concerning the impact of Bt-maize on health and the environment. The EFSA reviewed studies the French government had submitted to back up its claim, and concluded that there was no new evidence to undermine its prior safety findings and considered the decision \\"scientifically unfounded\\". The High Council for Biotechnology subcommittee dealing with economic, ethical and social aspects recommended an additional \\"GMO-free\\" label for anything containing less than 0.1% GMO which is due to come in late 2010. In 2011, the European Court of Justice and the French Conseil d'État ruled that the French farm ministry ban of MON 810 was illegal, as it failed \\"to give proof of the existence of a particularly high level of risk for the health and the environment\\". On September 17, 2015 the French government announced it would effectively continue to ban GMO crops by enacting an \\"opt-out\\" provision, previously agreed to for the 28 EU member states in March 2015, by asking the European Commission for France to extend the GMO ban on nine additional strains of maize. The policy announcement was made simultaneously by the French farm and environment ministries. Germany In April 2009, German Federal Minister Ilse Aigner announced an immediate halt to cultivation and marketing of MON 810 maize under the safeguard clause. The ban was based on \\"expert opinion\\" that suggested there was reasonable grounds to believe that MON 810 maize presents a danger to the environment. Three French scientists reviewing the scientific evidence used to justify the ban concluding that it did not use a case-by-case approach, confused potential hazards with proven risks and ignored the meta-knowledge on Bt expressing maize, instead focusing on selected individual studies. In August 2015 Germany announced its intention to ban genetically modified crops. Northern Ireland In September 2015, Northern Ireland announced a ban on genetically modified crops.  Romania  Romania grew GM soybeans in 1999, increasing their yields by 30%, allowing them to export excess product. When they joined the European Union in 2007 they were no longer allowed to grow the GM crop, resulting in the total area planted in soybeans dropping by 70%. Switzerland In 1992, Switzerland voted in favour of the introduction of an article about assisted reproductive technologies and genetic engineering in the Swiss Federal Constitution. In 1995, Switzerland introduced regulations requiring labelling of food containing genetically modified organisms. It was one of the first countries to introduce labelling requirements for GMOs. In 2003, the Federal Assembly adopted the \\"Federal Act on Non-Human Gene Technology\\". A federal popular initiative introducing a moratorium on genetically modified organisms in the Swiss agriculture was introduced from 2005 to 2010. Later, the Swiss parliament extended this moratorium to 2013. Between 2007 and 2011, the Swiss Government funded thirty projects to investigate the risks and benefits of GMOs. These projects concluded that there were no clear health or environmental dangers associated with planting GMOs. However, they also concluded that there was little economic incentive for farmers to adopt GMOs in Switzerland. The Swiss parliament then extended the moratorium to 2017, and then to 2021. As of 2016, six cantons (Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Jura, Ticino and Vaud) have introduced laws against genetically modified organisms in agriculture. More than one hundred communes have declared themselves free of genetically modified organisms. The cantons of Switzerland perform tests to assess the presence of genetically modified organisms in foodstuffs. In 2008, 3% of the tested samples contained detectable amounts of GMOs. In 2012, 12.1% of the samples analysed contained detectable amounts of GMOs (including 2.4% of GMOs forbidden in Switzerland). Except one, all the samples tested contained less than 0.9% of GMOs; which is the threshold that impose labeling indicating the presence of GMOs in food. Scotland In August 2015, the Scottish government announced that it would \\"shortly submit a request that Scotland is excluded from any European consents for the cultivation of GM crops, including the variety of genetically modified maize already approved and six other GM crops that are awaiting authorisation.\\"  See also  *Regulation of genetic engineering * European Food Safety Authority Notes and references  External links  * European Food and Safety Authority * EU Register of authorised GMOs - European Commission Category:Regulation of genetically modified organisms Category:European Union and agriculture Category:Food safety in the European Union Category:European Union regulations ","title":"Genetically modified food in the European Union"},{"id":"33942961","text":"Stagefright is the second album released by the British heavy metal band Witchfynde.

The plant reproduces sexually by seed and asexually by sprouting large colonies from the rhizome. Some populations produce no flowers in a given season and reproduce only vegetatively. Ecology This plant is a climax species, occurring in mature forests and tolerant of shade. It is a dominant herb in a number of ecosystems, such as the forests of the Appalachian Mountains. It occurs there in the understory of red spruce (Picea rubens) and balsam or Fraser fir (Abies balsamea or A. fraseri). It is also dominant in northern hardwood forest habitat and its ecotones, in the understory of red or sugar maple (Acer rubrum or A. saccharum), yellow birch (Betula lutea), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Other dominant understory species growing with it include false lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum canadense), goldthread (Coptis groenlandica), starflower (Trientalis borealis), and woodferns (Dryopteris spp.). This plant's extensive root network helps it stabilize the soil. It can grow on flat ground or steep slopes. The climate is often cool and moist, with high humidity and precipitation, including fog drip, and areas of long-lasting snowpack. Wildfire is uncommon.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2008. The 2008 Carlisle City Council election took place on 1 May 2008 to elect members of Carlisle District Council in Cumbria, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 21 *Conservative 21 *Liberal Democrats 7 *Independent 1 *Vacant 2 Background Before the election the Labour party held 25 seats, compared to 19 Conservatives, 7 Liberal Democrats and 1 independent. However the Conservatives had run the council since 1999, latterly with the support of the Liberal Democrats. 17 seats were scheduled to be contested, with Labour needing 1 gain to probably be able to take control. 3 councillors stood down at the election, Conservative Judith Prest from Brampton ward and Labour's John Reardon and Ray Warwick from Upperby and Yewdale wards respectively. As well as candidates from the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, there were also 9 candidates from the British National Party, 1 from the English Democrats and 4 independents, including the only sitting independent councillor, Bill Graham in Hayton. Campaign Labour targeted the seat of Morton from the Liberal Democrats, while campaigning on pledges to establish a theatre/arts centre and to review the Carlisle Renaissance programme, which would see 100 new homes built every year for a decade. However the Conservatives aimed to take Belle Vue and Yewdale from Labour, and Dalston from the Liberal Democrat group leader Trevor Allison. The Conservatives defended their record in control of the council, pointing to council tax increases being kept down and increased recycling rates. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats promised to campaign against the closure of post offices. During the campaign the British National Party candidate for Upperby, Les Griffiths, died and as a result the election in Upperby was postponed. In the week before the election one of the Labour councillors for Upperby, June Martlew, also died and as a result both seats were set to be filled at a by- election on 12 June after the main council election had taken place. Election result The Conservatives gained 2 seats from Labour to move level with Labour on 21 seats. The Conservative gains came in Belle Vue by 62 votes and in Yewdale, which they took by 42 votes after having fallen 10 votes short in 2007. These were the first urban seats the Conservatives had held south of the River Eden since 2004. Elsewhere the Conservatives came within 66 votes of defeating the Labour group leader Michael Boaden in Botcherby and the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Carlisle parliamentary constituency, John Stevenson, easily held his seat in Stanwix Urban. The Conservatives put their gains down to the unpopularity of the national Labour government and saw the results as a good sign for the next general election, as they were 1,481 votes ahead of Labour in the wards that made up Carlisle constituency. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats stayed on 7 seats after holding all 3 seats they had been defending, with their group leader Trevor Allison increasing his majority to 223 in Dalston, from just 1 when he took the seat in 2004. Independent Bill Graham was the only other candidate elected, holding his seat in Hayton comfortably, but the British National Party did come second in Currock, for the second election in a row, with an increased 28% of the vote. Overall turnout at the election was 38.1%, an increase from 35.5% in 2007. Following the election Conservative Mike Mitchelson was re-elected as leader of the council, with the Liberal Democrats continuing to have a seat on the council executive. Ward results By-elections between 2008 and 2010 Upperby A by-election in Upperby was held on 12 June 2008 for 2 seats on the council, after the deaths of a British National Party candidate during the council election campaign, and then the death of Labour councillor June Martlew. Labour held both seats, with a reduced majority, thereby becoming the largest party on the council with 23 seats, compared to 21 for the Conservatives. Belah and Castle By-elections were held in Belah and Castle wards on 5 March 2009, after the death of Conservative councillor for Belah, Sandra Fisher, in December 2008, and the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor for Castle, Kimberly Hunter, in January 2009. Both seats were held by the defending party, Conservative Gareth Ellis in Belah and Liberal Democrat Colin Farmer in Castle, with Labour finishing second in both seats.

The second device in the Bold series, it succeeds the model 9000 and precedes the Bold 9650. The device, which runs on the BlackBerry OS, features several improvements over the 9000, including introduction of an optical trackpad, and a reduced size overall. Other visual changes were carried out in order to appeal both men and women. Upon release, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 received mostly positive reviews from critics. The smartphone was commended for its design and most changes were favored, such as the trackpad. However, critics were ambivalent towards the dated software and the slow browser, and some concluded that the device did not set itself apart from previous models. The BlackBerry Bold 9700 was succeeded by the upgraded version, the BlackBerry Bold 9780, introduced in October 2010. The BlackBerry Bold 9700 was discontinued in December 2011.  History   Rumors and prototypes  Starting April 2009, various rumors circulated regarding the smartphone and other reportedly planned models for the BlackBerry line-up. The first rumor reported that a trio of devices were being developed as high-end smartphones, codenamed Onyx, Driftwood and Magnum. All of them were rumored to contain a \\"hybrid concept\\" with a touch screen and a QWERTY keyboard, with similar prototype designs but destined to different networks. Onyx was rumored to be released only for AT&T; markets. An image of one of Onyx's early prototypes surfaced online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same trackball. That prototype was early reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding technicalities were revealed on a surfaced AT&T; filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, a photo of the device surfaced, though it replaced the trackball with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a trackball was put up for sale on eBay, where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre- launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT&T; surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device. A T-Mobile press image was leaked on September 8. Announcement and release On October 7, 2009, technology website Engadget reported that mobile carriers T-Mobile and AT&T; would publicly announce the Bold 9700 on October 21, 2009. Two days later, the website posted that rumors were circulating on the Internet, which predicted that the smartphone would be released to the United States T-Mobile on November 11, 2009. The aforementioned carrier was then revealed to be sending invitations to \\"executive briefing\\" events—taking place in Los Angeles on November 3, 2009; in New York City. T-Mobile Germany announced on October 15, 2009 that the Bold 9700 would be released in that country in November. Bold 9700 in its black and white versions The device was officially presented in Bochum, Germany—where it was developed—on October 21, 2009. The launch event was hosted by BlackBerry (then known as RIM) vice chairman Mike Lazaridis. Boy Genius Report reported on November 4 of that year that the smartphone would be available early five days later for \\"select business customers\\". On November 16, it was officially released to the general public in the United States under T-Mobile; AT&T; released it on November 22. A new white version of the Bold 9700 was hinted at by Research In Motion (RIM)'s Thai website, which posted an image of that version. On April 7, 2010, it was exclusively released on T-Mobile Netherlands. It was first released in North America by operator Rogers Communications in Canada, followed by its first release in the United States by T-Mobile, in May 2010, at a retail price of $100 with a contract. The AT&T; release occurred on the 26th of that month. A special \\"Team Canada\\" edition of the Bold 9700 was also given to Future Shop employees once they reached a certain number of sales. Features Hardware The Bold 9700 without its battery cover The smartphone considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624 MHz processor and a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1 cm) non- touch LCD display at a resolution of 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was compared to that of HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; on the right side of it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal to both sexes. The 3.2-megapixels camera is accompanied by a LED flash, and allows autofocusing and video recording. More features include a microSD slot and a headphone port. Relatively to its connectivity, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 has support for 3G HSDPA networks and integrates Wi-Fi and GPS. The T-Mobile version of the Bold 9700 supports UMA technology—unlicensed mobile access, which allows making voice calls with a Wi-Fi network and not just with a cellular network. Software Upon release, the smartphone came with version 5 of BlackBerry's operating system, the BlackBerry OS. For the Bold 9700, the system came with upgrades, specifically for Messaging, Calendar and Browser applications; support for BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) and BlackBerry Internet Service, the latter allowing having up to 10 personal or business- oriented POP3 or IMAP4 e-mail accounts registered. The software also comes with \\"personal information management tools\\" and pre-loaded applications, such as a calculator, a clock, a task list and Documents To Go; along with more downloads found in BlackBerry World (then BlackBerry App World), though extra applications can only be downloaded to the smartphone's main memory and not to the microSD memory card. The phone's browser contains a faster JavaScript and enabled CSS processing, which allows faster page loading; it also supports widgets, streaming and Google Gears. The device also features speed dialing. The media player, which has basic functionalities such as searching, creating playlists and shuffle and repeat modes, supports MP3, WMA, WMA ProPlus, AAC, AAC+ and eAAC+ songs; it also plays MPEG4, WMV, and H.264 video files which can be played in a full-screen mode. Users' personal libraries can be synced from desktop/laptop media players through BlackBerry Media Sync. An updated version of the operating system, BlackBerry 6, was announced by Research In Motion on August 3, 2010. It was initially announced for the Bold 9700, Bold 9650 and Pearl 3G models, while it debuted on the BlackBerry Torch smartphone. It improves several functionalities of BlackBerry 5, such as: icons on the home screen are arranged in five different views, which the user can view separately by swiping the trackpad; a search tool (\\"Universal Search\\"); an improved web browser, based on layout engine software WebKit, which contains diverse tabs that can be open simultaneously; pre-loaded social networking apps and enabling \\"rich content\\" on text messages, which are displayed in a chat-like format. It was released by T-Mobile on March 4, 2011; AT&T; released it for Bold 9700 and Curve 3G models on April 29, 2011;  Critical reception  Gareth Beavis of TechRadar awarded the smartphone four stars out of five. He pointed out that users who would upgrade to the phone from its predecessor could experience difficulties with typing, due to the reduced size of the keyboard, which he called \\"a little cramped for [his taste]\\". Beavis stated that he liked its \\"solid build quality[, which] cradles a battery with unrivalled lasting ability\\", the screen quality and the new optical trackpad. However, he opined that the device \\"still feels like the BlackBerrys of old\\" and felt it needed to be upgraded, along with its software features. Laura June from Engadget said that the \\"device feels nice in the hand\\" due to the \\"smaller, more sleek form factor of the whole package\\". Unlike Beavis from TechRadar, she felt \\"typing on [the keyboard] is a joy\\", while she agreed that \\"the larger-handed among us [could feel] pretty cramped\\". She wrote: > And, at the end of the day, that's one thing we can't get past—serious > BlackBerry enthusiasts will tell you that the interface is doing just fine, > and there are plenty of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, > however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful > hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other > BlackBerry. Digital Trends' Nick Mokey referred to the Bold 9700 as a \\"recommended product\\". Awarding it four stars out of five, he stated that the overall \\"solid feel of the phone helps\\" stand out an \\"overall aura of quality\\". He found that the keyboard was \\"bordering on too small\\", although he named it the \\"finest\\" keyboard that can be \\"fold[ed] into a space this size\\". He also called the screen \\"amazing\\" and its call voice quality \\"excellent\\". Concluding the review, Mokey compared the smartphone to a Curve 8900 with a better battery, keyboard, a trackpad and what was missing on that phone—3G Internet coverage. He wrote: \\"Although the Bold 9700 lacks the frills of an iPhone or Palm Pre, for utilitarian business users, it’s one of the most polished smartphones on the market today.\\" Jamie Lendino and Sascha Segan from PC Magazine, who respectively reviewed the AT&T; and T-Mobile versions, gave the smartphone a rating of four out of five points. The former described the Bold 9700 as \\"powerful, comfortable, and even somewhat chic\\" and its keyboard as \\"comfortable, quiet, and accurate\\". Emphasizing the quality of the voice calls, Lendino wrote they were \\"crisp, clear, and with plenty of gain in both direction\\". She regarded the Internet browser as \\"poor\\", noting that some pages take more than one minute to fully load; she also claimed the video playback was problematic. Sascha Segan named it \\"evolutionary, not revolutionary\\", having a similar opinion to Lendino though remarking that the video player ran with no problems and emphasizing the photo camera power.

Boeke created and developed Sea Ranch, California, a 10-mile-long planned coastal community of 1,700 homes in Sonoma County, California. Boeke advocated integration of the homes with the surrounding landscape, environmental preservation and low density development while creating Sea Ranch and his other planned communities. Boeke recruited some of the best-known 20th-century American architects to create Sea Ranch's wooden homes, which became well known in design and development circles. Biography Boeke was born to Alfred and Adah Harris Boeke in Denver, Colorado, on November 20, 1922. His family relocated to Altadena, California, where Boeke was raised. Boeke earned a bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1948. He worked for Richard Neutra, an influential, Los Angeles-based modernist architect during his early career. Boeke was hired by Castle & Cooke, real estate company owned by the Dole Food Company, in 1959. Under Castle & Cooke, Boeke served as the development director of Mililani, Hawai'i, planned community of approximately 28,000 residents on Oahu. Boeke first saw the land that would become Sea Ranch, California, in 1962 while on a scouting flight with a real estate specialist in Northern California. He was Vice President of Planning and Development at the time for Oceanic Properties, a division of Castle & Cooke, at the time. Boeke was reportedly impressed with the landscape and Gualala River which runs through the area. He had the pilot of the twin-engine Cessna make two to three passes over the ranch before proclaiming, \\"I don't want to look at anything else.\\" He envisioned a new community on the site based on the ideas of the new towns movement, which advocated the needs of residents over corporate profits and dense development which could lead to congestion. Boeke persuaded Oceanic Properties to purchase Del Mar Ranch, the 5,200-acre coastal sheep ranch where the community of Sea Ranch now stands. The company purchased the land for $2.3 million, which is less than $500 per acre. Boeke envisioned the new town, called Sea Ranch as an affordable alternative to high density development for middle and upper-middle class homeowners. Sea Ranch He hired landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the master plan for Sea Ranch. Boeke created a committee which reviewed home plans, which restricted homes to two stories with natural colors and mandated underground power lines to preserve the area's natural heritage. Boeke commissioned extensive environmental impact studies, which led to the reseeding of former sheep grazing areas, the removal of debris and logs left by logging, and the replanting of native trees. American architects who were hired as consultants and designers included Joseph Esherick, Donlyn Lyndon, Charles Willard Moore, Richard Whitaker and William Turnbull. The American Institute of Architects awarded a 10-unit Sea Ranch condo building its \\"award of enduring excellence\\" in 1991. The Institute said that Sea Ranch \\"formed an alliance of architecture and nature that has inspired and captivated a generation of architects\\" at the time. Death Al Boeke died at his home in Sea Ranch, California, on November 8, 2011, at the age of 88. He was survived by his current wife, Pamela Clarke Boeke; two sons from his previous marriage, Brandt and Alan; his brother and sister; and several grandchildren.

Among his major achievements were the introduction of the Reformation, the foundation of the Gymnasium Philippinum in Weilburg and the start of the construction of Schloss Weilburg.  Life  Philip was the son of Louis I of Nassau-Weilburg (1473–1523). After his father's death, he took over the business of government at the age of 19 years. During Philip's reign, the Nassau-Weilburg part of the County of Nassau consisted of the districts of Weilburg, Merenberg, Usingen, Sonnenberg and Gleiberg. Important towns were Kirberg, Weilmünster and Neuweilnau. Moreover, he held shares in jointly owned territories. Co-owners of those territories included the Counts of Nassau- Saarbrücken and Nassau-Wiesbaden and the Landgrave of Hesse. The Reformation began during Philip's time in office. Philip promoted the Reformation in his territory, and to this end, he joined forces with Landgrave Philip I of Hesse. On the other hand, he made sure he would not become a vassal of Hesse. He therefore emphasized his position as an immediate count and was active in the Wetterau Association of imperial counts. Philip died in 1559 in Weilburg, at the age of 55. He was buried in the chapel of Weilburg Castle. He left a heavily indebted county. His goals had exceeded his financial possibilities. His sons Albert and Philip IV ruled Nassau-Weilburg jointly until 1561, and then divided their inheritance, with Albert receiving Weilburg and Philip IV receiving Neuweilnau.  Foreign Policy  Because his father had left a huge debt, John Louis of Nassau-Saarbrücken was appointed as Philip's guardian and regent of Nassau-Weilburg. Philip took up government himself in 1524. He began by dividing the Lordships of Stauf, Eisenberg and Kirchheim; these were jointly owned by Nassau-Weilburg and Nassau-Saarbrücken. He also renewed the inheritance treaty between Nassau-Weilburg and Nassau-Saarbrücken in 1524. With the progress of the Reformation, the two counts drifted apart and Philip sought support in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. During the Diet at Regensburg in 1532, Philip of Nassau-Weilburg and his cousin Philip of Nassau-Wiesbaden promised Emperor Charles V 16 knights and 80 foot soldiers, for the ongoing war against the Ottoman Empire. In return, Nassau-Weilburg received market rights for Rückershausen and Usingen. After the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts had been dissolved in 1535, Philip approached Landgrave Philip of Hesse. On 25 January 1536, Philip and Philip concluded a comprehensive territory exchange agreement. Nassau-Weilburg transferred the tax revenue of the imperial free city of Wetzlar, the sovereignty over Kalsmunt Castle, the imperial bailiwick of Wetzlar and the dominion over Altenberg Abbey to Hesse. In exchange, he received the castle and city of Katzenelnbogen, the district and castle of Löhnberg and the right to redeem the Hessian share in the castle and district of Hadamar. On the recommendation of Philip I of Hesse, Philip III formally joined the Schmalkaldic League on 26 August 1537. However, he only supported the League reluctantly. In particular, he did not pay the special contribution that the League had agreed to. His argument was that he had not received a copy of the League's charter. After Philip I married bigamously in 1540 and the League failed to support him against Trier, Philip III distanced himself from the Schmalkaldic League, without officially terminating his membership. He remained, however, in close contact with Philip I of Hesse. During the Schmalkaldic War, Philip III supported Philip I with eight knights. After the initial successes of the imperial troops on the Danube, he recalled this support. The imperial field marshal Reinhard of Solms then mediated a reconciliation between Philip III and Emperor Charles V. After he had ceased his support for the Schmalkaldic League, Philip III worked to recreate the Wetterau Association. The Association was re-established in 1542 and 1549, he was elected chairman of the Association.  Mining policy  To improve his financial situation, Philip tried to intensify mining in his county. Between 1524 and 1530, he founded several iron mines around Weilmünster, together with civil partners. His family managed, over time, to gain the majority of the shares in the mining companies. In 1536 Philip issued a uniform mining regulations for his entire territory. However, the economic recovery he had hoped for, failed to materialize.  Construction policy  The residence Philip built in Weilburg is the East Wing of Schloss Weilburg Philip initiated several construction projects in his county. The most important project was the construction of a new residence in Weilburg. Schloss Weilburg was built in two phases. Architect Nicholas Schickedanz from Frankfurt built the east wing, a prestigious residential building. Balthasar Wolff from Heilbronn added the south and west wings, which were used as commercial buildings. The construction lasted from 1533 to 1549. Even today, the alliance coat of arms of Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg and Amalie of Isenburg-Büdingen is attached to the stair tower of the east wing. The dilapidated town church of Weilburg was repaired and a new tower was added in 1555. This tower also served temporarily a water tower. It was also later incorporated into Schloss Weilburg. Below the schloss, a stone bridge across the Lahn was built in 1555, connecting the dominions of Weilburg and Merenberg. After the construction at Weilburg had completed, Usingen Castle was again expanded between 1551 and 1558.  Reformation  The Reformation was introduced in Nassau-Weilburg during Philip's reign. Initially he went along with the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. However, from 1526, he increasingly took the lead. The Reformation was rapidly implemented in the areas Philip III held jointly with Philip I of Hesse, such as the Hüttenberg district and the area along the river Lahn, with the towns Heuchelheim, Kinzenbach, Launsbach, Wißmar, Rodheim and Fellingshausen. Philip attended the meeting of the Wetterau Association on 20 June 1524. The meeting decided not to use the Edict of Worms. This brought Philip into conflict with Archbishop Richard of Trier, who held that Philip was interfering in his spiritual jurisdiction and kept back taxes Richard was entitled to. During the German Peasants' War, Philip sided with the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, who attempted to crush the uprising. The Protestant faith was addressed at the meeting of the Wetterau Association in 1525 in Butzbach in the presence of Count Herman of Neuenahr the Elder. A list of monasteries and abbeys was drafted, so they could be taxed in the future. The abbey at Weilburg, for example, would be taxed 100 guilders; the Pfannstiel monastery at was assessed at 15 guilders. In 1525/26, Philip appointed Erhard Schnepf as the first Protestant preacher in his county. After the Diet of Speyer in 1526, Schnepf was tasked with implementing the Reformation in Weilburg. When he carried out this task, Schnepf met with opposition from the abbey at Weilburg, the monastery at Pfannstiel and Johann Roß, the town priest of Weilburg. Philip backed Schnepf, despite protests from the archbishops of Mainz and Trier. The Wetterau Association was slowed down by internal squabbles. When the University of Marburg offered Schneps a position, Philip tried to keep him in Weilburg and expelled Johann Roß, who had been a priest in Weilburg for 28 years. Nevertheless, Schneps accepted the position in Marburg in 1528. The implementation of the Reformation was continued by the court chaplain, Heinrich Stroß. In 1535, he introduced the first comprehensive visitation scheme in Nassau-Weilburg. The Reformation in Nassau-Weilburg was accelerated after Philip joined the Schmalkaldic League. Philip ordered the dissolution of the small Pfannstiel monastery and the sale of some valuable liturgic vessels from the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Walpurga in Weilburg. In 1540, Philip founded a free school in Weilburg, which quickly became a center of education. It was the forerunner of today's Gymnasium Philippinum Weilburg. After Heinrich Stroß's death, Kasper Goltwurm was appointed as court chaplain at Weilburg in 1546. In 1547, Goltwurm organized a synod of the clergy in the county of Nassau-Weilburg and lent his hand to the free school. In 1548, Philip officially appointed Goltwurm as visitor. The Reformation was interrupted by the Augsburg Interim. Goltwurm encouraged priests to resist the Catholic Counter-Reformation operated by the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier. The Counter-Reformation failed, because the bishops did not have enough priests to serve all the parishes and therefore had to leave some reformed pastors in office. In 1550, Philip gave Goltwurn six months leave of absence. Goltwurm travelled to Wittenberg and wrote entitled the beautiful and comforting history of Joseph, which he dedicated to Philip. Philip and Goltwurm could resume the Reformation after the 1552 Peace of Passau. The Catholic priests who had been appointed during the Counter- Reformation, were relieved of their parishes. Several valuable chalices and vestments were sold off. The abbey at Weilburg received a new order. A synod of Reformed clergy was convened at Weilburg in 1553. The abbey at Weilburg was definitively dissolved on 3 January 1555. The spiritual jurisdiction of the archbishops was repealed with the Peace of Augsburg.  Marriages and issue  In 1523 Philip married Elisabeth of Sayn-Hachenburg (died: 5 February 1531). The Sayn-Hachenburg family were also members of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. Philip and Elisabeth had four children, who all died at a young age. After Elizabeth's death, Philip married in 1536 with Anne of Mansfield (born: 1520; died: 26 December 1537). This marriage had been mediated by Landgrave Philip I of Hesse. Anne died while giving birth to her only child: * Albert (born: 26 December 1537; died: 11 November 1593 in Ottweiler). Οn 17 August 1541 Philip married his third wife, Amalie of Isenburg-Büdingen (born: 23 June 1522; died: 18 May 1579 in Offenbach). This marriage had also been mediated by Philip I of Hesse. With her he had three children: * Philip IV (born: 14 October 1542; died: 12 March 1602 in Saarbrücken) * Ottilie (born: 27 July 1546; died: ), married Count Otto I of Salm-Kyrburg (born: 15 August 1538; died: 7 June 1607) * Anna Amalie (born: 26 July 1549; died: 7 January 1598), married in 1588 with Count Frederick I of Salm (1547–1608) Ancestry  See also  * House of Nassau  References  * Dr. F.

In April 1967 he formed a soul music group, Cam-Pact, which released four singles and an extended play, Something Easy. He left by June 1969 to appear in the Australian stage production of Hair as Berger (replaced by Reg Livermore in 1970). As a solo artist Glass released country and R&B; albums, Going Over Old Ground (1989), Living Down My Past (1991), Smoke and Mirrors (1997), Southerly Buster (3 May 1999), Australian Soul (19 July 2001) and Miss Ala (26 October 2005). In 1977 Glass and David Pepperell founded Missing Link Records, the following year he signed and managed The Boys Next Door, a punk band, featuring Nick Cave, Mick Harvey, Phill Calvert and Tracy Pew. Glass co-produced the group's 1980 album, The Birthday Party, before they relocated to London and changed their name to match its title. In October 1981 Australian music journalist, Glenn A. Baker, described the Missing Link label in Billboard which was \\"recognised for the cornerstone upon which much of Australia's new wave music movement has been built ... [Glass'] understanding and appreciation of the grass roots level of rock music is considered impeccable\\". Biography Keith Robert Glass was born on 17 September 1946, and he received guitar lessons at Lou Toppano's Music School on his Maton Alver acoustic guitar. From 1958 Glass attended Brighton High School. In 1963 The Rising Sons were formed as a R&B; band in Brighton with Glass on lead guitar, and three Brighton Grammar School students: Clive Davies on rhythm guitar, Dennis \\"Fred\\" Foster on drums and Russell Naughton on bass guitar. Their first gig was a dance for Brighton Grammar School. They played cover versions of instrumentals by The Ventures, Duane Eddy and The Shadows. They recorded material but none was released. Glass attempted first year of a law course at University of Melbourne but transferred to RMIT and starting a design course. By late 1965 The Rising Sons had disbanded. In 1966 Glass and Foster formed a folk, baroque rock group, Eighteenth Century Quartet, with Frank Lyons on bass guitar; Hans Poulsen on guitar, vocals, bouzouki and mandolin; and John Pugh on guitar, violin, autoharp, harmonica and backing vocals. After issuing their debut single, \\"Rachel\\" in October, Poulsen left for a solo career. Glass wrote and sang lead on their second single, \\"Am I a Lover?\\" (December). Their live work \\"bore no relationship to the earlier folk- rock trappings\\" and they \\"began playing more uptempo soul/R&B;/rock material\\". The group disbanded in March 1967. In April 1967 Glass and Pugh formed a soul music group, Cam-Pact, with Mark Barnes on bass guitar, Bob Lloyd (aka Bob Tregilgas) on drums, and Chris Stockley on guitar. They released four singles, \\"Something Easy\\" (March 1968), \\"Drawing Room\\" (May), \\"Good Good Feelin'\\" (September) and \\"Potion of Love\\" (June 1969) and an extended play, Something Easy. In late 1968 Barnes had left and Glass took on bass guitar before he and Stockley also left by mid-1969. Stockley joined Axiom and from June that year Glass appeared in the Australian stage production of Hair as Berger (replaced by Reg Livermore in 1970) starting an 18-month run in Sydney. In 1970 after finishing Hair, Glass returned to Melbourne and formed country rock group, Sundown, with Barnes (ex-Cam-Pact); Broderick Smith on lead vocals and harmonica, Kerryn Tolhurst on guitar; (both ex-Adderley Smith Blues Band); and Barry Windley on drums (Chessmen, Cherokees, Quinn). The group only issued one single, \\"This Country of Mine\\" (June 1972), before disbanding. The track was written by Glass and was later recorded by Slim Dusty. In 1971 Glass and David Pepperell (journalist, and vocalist of The Union) founded the Melbourne Import record store, Archie & Jughead's, which specialised in imported albums from Europe and America. In September 1973 Glass travelled to the United States to make business contacts for the store and with a view to getting his own songs published. Since 1977 he has pursued an intermittent solo career generally as a country musician. One such project was Keith Glass Band, an R&B; and country rock group, which included Wayne Duncan on bass guitar (ex-Daddy Cool), Robert Souter on drums and Les Stacpool on guitar. With the addition of Wayne Burt (Daddy Cool, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) on guitar in October that year, the group's name changed to The Living Legends. In 1978 the retail store was renamed Missing Link Records. In 1977 Glass and Pepperell had also founded an independent record label of the same name. Pepperell departed in 1978 and Glass signed The Boys Next Door, a punk band featuring Nick Cave, Mick Harvey, Phill Calvert and Tracy Pew, for whom Glass was also the manager. Missing Link issued the band's first EP, Hee Haw (1979) and the album, The Birthday Party (November 1980). Glass co-produced the album with The Boys Next Door and Tony Cohen. By the time of its release the group had relocated to London and renamed themselves as The Birthday Party. In May the label issued Ed Kuepper's alternate jazz-rock group, Laughing Clowns's debut eponymous EP, which was also engineered by Cohen. In October that year Australian music journalist, Glenn A. Baker, writing for Billboard described the label which was \\"recognised for the cornerstone upon which much of Australia's new wave music movement has been built ... [Glass'] understanding and appreciation of the grass roots level of rock music is considered impeccable\\". In November Missing Link Records promoted a concert at Sydney's Paris Theatre by Laughing Clowns and The Birthday Party – they were supported by Brisbane group, The Go- Betweens. Glass signed them to his label, which issued their fourth single, \\"Your Turn My Turn\\", in April 1981 and followed by their first official album, Send Me a Lullaby, in November. The retail store had been run by Glass with his then-wife Helena Glass until they sold it late in 1981 to siblings Nigel and Diane Rennard. In July the following year Baker reported that Glass had been fined $750 for having sold US punk rockers, Dead Kennedys' 1981 single \\"Too Drunk to Fuck\\" in his store. The judge, Patrick Street, described the track as \\"the vilest of trash ... likely to deprave and corrupt\\" – Glass responded that the store had held some 40 recordings that were similar. In late 1981 and early 1982 Glass was observing Cohen who was working in AAV studio in Richmond with The Birthday Party on their album, Junkyard (May 1982) when they were visited by The Go-Betweens. A jam session resulted in a single, \\"After the Fireworks\\", released by a short-lived super-group, Tuff Monks, which included members of both The Birthday Party and The Go-Betweens. Glass later recalled: Glass worked as a songwriter in Nashville before returning to Australia in 1986. Under the pseudonym, Onie J. Holy, he issued an extended play, God, Guns and Guts, on Au Go Go Records. He followed with country, blues groups: Keith Glass Honky Tonk Band and Keith Glass and the Tumblers. Glass contributed three tracks to the soundtrack for the Nadia Tass-directed film, Rikky and Pete (1988). In 1988 he signed with Virgin Records and issued his solo album, Going Over Old Ground, the following year. In 1990 Glass co- produced the album, Two Roads: Live in Australia by US country rockers, Butch Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. In 1991 he released another solo album, Living Down My Past. He made several appearances at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in the early 1990s. Glass co-hosted a radio program, High in the Saddle, with Dave Dawson on 3RRR-FM. From the mid-1990s he was a member of the country music trio, Hamilton Glass and Young: with former Brighton High School mate, Mick Hamilton on guitar, and Gary Young (Daddy Cool, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) on drums. They issued three albums: Rocking Cowboy (Larrikin Records, 1993), Songs the Radio Taught Us (Massive, 1995) and Unidentified Playing Objects (Massive, 1996). Glass' third solo album, Smoke and Mirrors, appeared in 1997. Two years later he issued, Southerly Buster (3 May 1999). In 2000 Glass and Hamilton combined for a CD, Clutching at Straws. On 19 July 2001 his next album, Australian Soul, appeared. To promote its release he toured North America with dates in southern US states and then in Canada – where he played with his namesake Keith Glass (William Keith Glass), guitarist for Prairie Oyster. In November he performed at the Frank Brown International Singer Songwriter Festival in Mobile, Alabama. From April 2002, Glass wrote for country music journal, Capital News. Also that year he produced Last Train... From Tennessee to Taree – a tribute album for US-born blue grass and skiffle artist, Johnny Duncan – which included two tracks written by Glass. By 2004 Glass relocated to Mobile, where he recorded his next album, Miss Ala (26 October 2005). In June 2008 he told The Sydney Morning Herald that his favourite Australian album was The Reels' debut eponymous album (1979): \\"[they] changed my life. From the first night I saw them on Countdown and went to the gig straight afterwards, they enchanted me. So clever, so cutting and quite XTC now I look back on it. The jerky new wave sounds and the image took me in from day one\\". In May 2011 Glass and Hamilton issued an album, The John Laws Experience, using lyrics originally written as poetry by former radio commentator, John Laws. Glass opened a record store, Mobile Records, in April 2012, stocking vinyl albums.

Although the footwork is the most distinctive aspect of the flip-flap, its success as a feint also relies heavily on the attacking player having an explosive acceleration from a stationary position. History The move was invented by the Japanese- Brazilian football player Sérgio Echigo. In 1964, Brazilian playmaker Rivellino learned the move from Echigo, who was his Corinthians teammate in the youth team, and performed it to a global audience during the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Interviewed on the television series Football's Greatest in 2012, Rivellino states; \\"He [Echigo] says now that he invented it, but I perfected it\\". Rivellino was an idol to a number of Brazilians, and the trick was popularized early 1980s by peruvian Julio César Uribe; late 1990s and 2000s by high-profile players such as Romário, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho among others.David Goldblatt (2009). \\"The Football Book\\". p. 129. D Kindersley Ltd, In recent years, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cristiano Ronaldo have also been are known proponents of the move. In Africa, especially Nigeria, the move has been referred to as a \\"Snakebite\\" or \\"Zigima\\" because of the in-and-out feet movement of the perpetrator. However, it is now more commonly called \\"The Gaúcho\\" – after Ronaldinho (Gaúcho). In futsal, freestyle and street football, an aerial variation of the flip flap moves has been referred to as a \\"Akka\\". The \\"Akka\\" has several variations, and can be used in combos with pannas and other ground moves for doling out maximum punishment.

A master of both flamenco and classical guitar, he is one of the world's few guitarists to continue the traditions of solo flamenco in concert performances. He is heavily influenced by Paco de Lucía and Sabicas. Goryachev is technically a highly proficient player, testament to his background in classical guitar from a very young age. Biography A native of St. Petersburg, Goryachev began to play the guitar at the age of six, taught by his father Dmitry, a master teacher and player of the classical guitar and learned quickly. He was a child prodigy, performing regularly in the top concert halls of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, Riga and other cities in the Soviet Union from the age of nine, receiving wide coverage in Soviet magazines and newspapers. His father was able to obtain copies of flamenco recordings of flamenco greats such as Juan Martín and Sabicas, attracting his interest from an early age. But access was limited; Goryachev has said, \\"I had very bad access to recordings. Most of what I used to pick up were pirates.\\" Goryachev has said of his allurement to flamenco, \\"It was everything: the sound of the guitar, the rhythms. It's hard not to be moved by this music. It moves me so much that I want to cry.\\" He performed as a child on Soviet radio and television and participated in the TV marathon, Revival of St. Petersburg, broadcast across the world. In 1986 he saw Paco de Lucía at a concert in Russia at the peak of his career which he says \\"blew his mind\\" and was \\"absolutely amazing\\"; it was a massive influence on him and a turning point in his life. From this point he concentrated on learning flamenco, helped by his father, transcribing many unpublished pieces completely by ear as he listened to recordings. He learned to play flamenco purely by listening to recordings of the masters, professing never to have learned from tablature in his life. His tremolo picking was initially poor, but on the advice of his father he practiced it slowly for two years, after which he was able to play proficiently. He was driven to play like his newfound hero, and would play along with the recordings, attempting to match the pace of de Lucia's picados. His initial study into flamenco covered the works of Juan Martín, and he performed these in concert while still a boy. In 1991, Goryachev performed at UN headquarters in New York City and also toured Scandinavia where he performed for royalty. In 1993, he represented his native city in the Days of St. Petersburg at the Jerusalem Festival, and in 1994 he performed at an Andrés Segovia memorial concert at the Festival International de Colmar in Colmar, France. In 1997 he toured Spain and met and performed with his hero, flamenco master Paco de Lucía who aided him in applying for a visa to go to the United States. Goryachev said, \\"I met Paco when I was touring Spain and I played for him at his home. He said that I sounded very good, but if I wanted to play flamenco I had to move to Spain. I never managed to do that.\\" His repertoire now also includes the music of other flamenco masters such as Vicente Amigo, Manolo Sanlucar and Rafael Riqueni. In May 2005 he was awarded a special prize for the Best Performance of Spanish Music at the VI International Classical Guitar Competition in Almería, Spain, later performing at the Festival de Música Española de Cádiz and the Festival de Música de Jimena de la Frontera. He is a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he studied under Eliot Fisk. Both Fisk and Christopher Parkening have praised Goryachev's abilities. Goryachev has recorded two albums of flamenco music: Alma Flamenca and Homenaje a Sabicas. Today, Goryachev is one of the world's few guitarists to continue the traditions of solo flamenco in concert performances.\\"Горячев Гриша\\", Meloman.ru. Retrieved 11 December 2012. He has professed his desire to see more guitarists follow his example in playing traditional flamenco to keep the music alive and to encourage classical players to play flamenco compositions in their repertoire and accept it. However, the Boston Globe says that his \\"repertoire ranges from traditional flamenco to jazzier works by contemporary composers\\". In May 2012 he performed Joaquín Rodrigo's popular Concierto de Aranjuez at the Melrose Memorial Hall in Boston. In October 2012 he performed with Peruvian guitarist Jorge Caballero at the 2012 Texas A&M; International Guitar Symposium and Competition at Rudder Theatre.

Early life He was the first son of Sir James Stewart of Goodtrees (1635–1713) by his first wife Agnes, daughter of the Rev. Robert Traill, and grandson of Sir James Stewart of Coltness (1608–1681), Lord Provost of Edinburgh. His father, a distinguished lawyer and an active Whig, was appointed Lord Advocate by William II and III in 1692. His sister, Anne Stewart, married William Mure of Caldwell, father of William Mure (1718–1776). Career Stewart followed his father into the law and became an advocate in 1704. In May 1705, he was elected to the Parliament of Scotland for Queensferry and was created a Baronet, of Goodtrees, on 22 December. First Parliament of Great Britain The failure of the Stewarts to support the Act of Union 1707 meant that the younger Stewart was not chosen to represent Scotland in the first Parliament of Great Britain, and did not stand at the general election in 1708. The elder Stewart was replaced as Lord Advocate by Sir David Dalrymple in 1709, but the younger Stewart succeeded Dalrymple as Solicitor-General, holding the office jointly with Thomas Kennedy of Dunure. Dalrymple, uncle to Stewart's wife Anne, supported the candidacy of his nephew-by-marriage for Edinburgh in 1710 without success. Involvement with Lord Advocate Stewart's father was reappointed Lord Advocate in 1711, but Stewart and Kennedy did most of the work. The elder Stewart died on 1 May 1713, and Stewart succeeded to the estates of Goodtrees and Coltness. Both Stewart and Kennedy expected promotion to the now-vacant office of Lord Advocate, and Stewart was elected to Parliament for Edinburgh in the general election of that year in an attempt to increase his influence. However Lord Oxford continued to leave the post vacant, and Stewart turned against the government, attacking ministers in Parliament over the New Woodstock election petition and the expulsion of Richard Steele. He was sacked as Solicitor- General in March 1714 and Kennedy was appointed Lord Advocate. Solicitor- General (1714) Following the death of Queen Anne and the accession of George I, Stewart was re-appointed as sole Solicitor-General in October 1714. He was again disappointed of the office of Lord Advocate, which went to Sir David Dalrymple. He did not contest his seat in Parliament at the general election of 1715, but remained politically active in Scotland, supporting the government during the Jacobite rising of that year. He continued as Solicitor- General until 1717. Personal life On 9 March 1705 he married Anne Dalrymple, daughter of the Lord President of the Court of Session Lord North Berwick. Together they had 12 children, including: *James Stewart (8 October 1707 – 1780), who married Lady Francis, daughter of David Wemyss, 4th Earl of Wemyss.

It is spoken in the Rosen Valley (, ) of Austria, west of a line from Villach to Faak am See and east of a line from Sittersdorf and Lake Klopein to Brückl, excluding the Ebriach dialect area to the southeast. Settlements in the dialect area include Wernberg, Köstenberg, Velden am Wörthersee, Ludmannsdorf, Köttmannsdorf, Viktring, Grafenstein, Tainach, and Rosegg (all north of the Drava River), and Sankt Jakob im Rosental, Feistritz im Rosental, Windisch Bleiberg, Ferlach, Zell, and Gallizien (south of the Drava River).Toporišič, Jože. 1992.

With Enderby Island it forms Class A Nature Reserve 36915, part of a proposed national park. During World War 2 an airstrip was established at the north end of the island, where there is also a vehicle track and a well with a distinctive date palm. The well was constructed of concrete with a corrugated steel liner and is now filled with 20th century debris. In 1699 the English navigator William Dampier, in command of the 26-gun warship HMS Roebuck on a mission to explore the coast of New Holland, following the Dutch route to the Indies, passed between Dirk Hartog Island and the Western Australian mainland into what he called Shark's Bay. He then followed the coast northeast, on 21 August 1699 reaching the Dampier Archipelago, which he explored, naming Rosemary Island on 22 August. He continued to Lagrange Bay, just south of what is now Roebuck Bay, before sailing for Timor. In 2016, archaeologists from the University of Western Australia excavated ancient rock shelters on Rosemary Island, between 8000 and 9000 years old. They may be the earliest known domestic structures in Australia. In 2017, UWA archaeologists identified engravings left by crews of American whaling ships in the 1850s on Rosemary Island and West Lewis Island. In some cases the engravings were made over the top of ancient Aboriginal rock art.

He is the leader of the theatre unit Port B, which he founded in 2003 to create site-specific performances. Life, career, and style Takayama was born in 1969 and spent several years in Germany studying theatre and linguistics. He returned to Japan in 1999 where he started initially making German-influenced productions, such as an adaption of a Brecht Lehr-stücke. His projects are now characterized by their use of the identity or history of a certain locale, such as the Sugamo area of north Tokyo, and the interaction or involvement of the \\"audience\\". He looks at contemporary issues, such as the rising numbers of working poor in Japan, and also makes extensive use of social and digital media.Iwaki, Kyoko, Tokyo Theatre Today – Conversations with Eight Emerging Theatre Artists, 2011, pp. 36-38 Takayama's unit, Port B, is a loose team of artists, scholars and activists from different backgrounds. The name \\"Port B\\" is a reference to Portbou, the Spanish border town where Walter Benjamin committed suicide in his failed bid to escape the Nazis in 1940. Benjamin is an influence on Port B.Eckersall, Peter, Performativity and Event in 1960s Japan: City, Body, Memory, 2013, p.132 Later productions included Tokyo/Olympics (2007), which took audiences on a seven-hour bus tour of the places prominent in Tokyo's post-war recovery, as symbolized by its Olympic Games. Audience members also traveled through areas like Sugamo and Harajuku partly by foot, using an MP3 player to listen to commentary and interviews. In this way, the performance took on the form of an oral history walking tour and coach tour that is immersive for the participants.Eckersall, op. cit., pp.132-160 passim Sunshine 62 (2008) was a walking tour of sites in Toshima ward, Tokyo, which has seen regeneration projects like the construction of the Sunshine 60 building, against the backdrop of sites that have disappeared, such as the former prison that housed war criminals. In recent years Takayama has been presenting his new Port B work as part of the annual Festival/Tokyo, Japan's largest performing arts event. This includes Compartment City – Tokyo (2009), which saw a temporary prefab house installed in a park in Tokyo, where visitors could enter to watch video interviews with unexpected urban residents. It was intended partly to create an experience of the private space within the public, against the context of growing numbers of internet cafe \\"refugees\\" in Japan. It was later also staged at the Wiener Festwochen. The Complete Manual of Evacuation – Tokyo Presented as part of Festival/Tokyo 2010, The Complete Manual of Evacuation – Tokyo was an interactive theatre project that involved audiences first logging onto a special website. After answering a series of basic personality test questions, they were then recommended an \\"evacuation\\" site located around the Yamanote Line that they had to make their own way to, assisted by directions on the website and signs near the actual site. The spots varied from arranged meetings with homeless people to encounters with minority groups, such as the Muslim community in Tokyo. Participants were then encouraged to post their responses to Twitter.Festival/Tokyo 2010 website The work was recreated by Takayama in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area in September and October 2014, in collaboration with many other artists. Evacuate Frankfurt involved more than 30 commuter and streetcar stations, uncovering unfamiliar spots in the urban territory of the region and exploring new meanings to the term \\"evacuation\\".Evacuate Frankfurt website Referendum Project In response to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima crisis, Takayama created the Referendum Project for Festival/Tokyo 2011. He was inspired by the Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant, which was cancelled following a public referendum. The project was a specially converted truck that visitors could enter to watch video interviews with hundreds of school children in Fukushima and Tokyo. They were all asked the same questions regarding their daily lives and their feelings about the current situation in Japan. Visitors were free to watch whichever and how many interviews they wanted in their own private booth, before \\"voting\\" in the fictional referendum themselves by filling out a questionnaire with the same kinds of questions.Tokyo's newest post-Fukushima visitor draw Article on CNNgo.com, October 21, 2011 The installation truck toured to different locations in Tokyo, Yokohama and Fukushima over a one-month period. The project was intended to galvanize people into direct political and social action, though Takayama expressed disappointment at the passivity of local audiences. “Audiences didn’t follow as closely as I’d hoped,” he said. “They were mostly passive observers. I’d hoped to stimulate people a bit more, but it didn’t seem to have that effect.”Drama in the Wake of Disaster Article in The New York Times, December 1, 2011 The project is ongoing and has since collected interviews with school students in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and has also toured to Vienna (Wiener Festwochen 2013) and Berlin (Hebbel am Ufer, 2014). Kein Licht II Takayama continued his response to the Fukushima disaster with his next project for the annual Festival/Tokyo's 2012 program. Kein Licht II was a site-specific, walking tour-style theatre experience based on the text Kein Licht – Epilog? by Elfriede Jelinek, written in 2011 response to the Fukushima events. A Japanese translation of the text was edited and then sections were recorded by high school girls in the Fukushima region. Audiences were given small transistor radios at a start point in Shinbashi, an area associated with Tokyo's modernization and post-war economic push (and where the TEPCO headquarters are located), and also received a small pack of postcards. The postcards featured media images from the 2011 Fukushima crisis and on the back, maps and directions to take them to different locations. Audience members then departed alone and walked around the area by themselves, following the route and, at each stop, tuned the radio to the frequency to hear the students' voices reading out a part of the Jelinek text. Each location was a recreation of the media image on the postcard. The performance was a success and extended by popular demand.Festival/Tokyo 2012 websiteSocial awareness takes center stage Article in The Japan Times, December 27, 2012 Tokyo Heterotopia Tokyo Heterotopia was a radio tour around Tokyo, tracing the lives of Asian exchange students and other Asian connections in the city. It featured special readings of texts created out of research into the history of certain sites in Tokyo. Audience members received a special booklet and radio, and were then free to travel to the sites around the city however they liked. The title is a reference to Michel Foucault's concept of a heterotopia space of otherness. Following its original Tokyo production in November and December 2013 as part of Festival/Tokyo 2013, a follow-up was created for the Yokohama Triennale 2014. Yokohama Commune was a video installation featuring the voices of Indochina refugees living in Japan. It had an extended life after the Yokohama Triennale was over as a \\"live installation\\" with the participants in a Japanese classroom.Yokohama Triennale 2014 website Notes References *Iwaki, Kyoko Tokyo Theatre Today – Conversations with Eight Emerging Theatre Artists (2011) Hublet Publishing (2011/11/6) *Eckersall, Peter Performativity and Event in 1960s Japan: City, Body, Memory (2013) Palgrave Macmillan (2013/9) External links *Port B website *Festival/Tokyo *The Complete Manual of Evacuation - Tokyo *Referendum Project Category:Japanese theatre directors Category:1969 births Category:Living people ","title":"Akira Takayama"},{"id":"33943773","text":"John Jago (1684 - after 1724) was a minister in St. John's, Newfoundland.

He was wounded twice in the war and received several awards like both classes of the Iron Cross. After the war he joined the Freikorps until he was accepted into the Reichswehr. Here again he mostly served in staff positions and was promoted to Generalmajor on 1 October 1931 and to Generalleutnant 2 years later. On 1 October 1933 he took command of the 1st Cavalry Division, which was disbanded in 1935. He successively entered retirement in 1935, as General of the Infantry. At the onset of World War II he was recalled into active service and took over command of the XXXVI Corps on May 1940. His unit subsequently participated in the Fall of France in the Lorraine region. The corps was then transferred to Norway. In preparation for Operation Barbarossa the corps moved into central Finland. When the German offensive was launched on 22 June 1941, his unit was together with the Finnish III Corps tasked to recapture Salla and cut Murmansk off from the rest of Russia by advancing eastwards during Operation Arctic Fox. Although Salla was recaptured, the advance of his ill-equipped forces stalled soon. Feige was pressured by von Falkenhorst, commander of Army Norway, to continue the offensive, which met with little results. The offensive was finally called off on 17 September 1941. In November he was withdrawn from his command and replaced by Karl Weisenberger as commander of XXXVI Corps. He subsequently was placed into the Führerreserve and never took over an active command again. As result of this inactivity he finally retired on 30 June 1942.

The brand name was derived from both the river upon which it was located and a breed of horse native to the region. Models V-150M and VP-150 VP-150 The VP-150 (Russian: ВП-150) was an unlicensed copy of the Vespa 150, first built in 1956. It was constructed of thicker steel than the Vespa to cope with the poorer Russian roads. Other minor differences included thicker tyres (10x4.0 instead of 10x3.5) and an adjustable headlamp. A glovebox was also incorporated under the front seat. 300,000 models were constructed before production terminated in 1965 after complaints from Piaggio. V-150M The V-150M Vyatka-2 was introduced in 1966 as a successor to the VP150. It used the same engine, but mounted centrally to give better stability. Final drive was by means of an enclosed chain.

They were instigated by Friday prayers' sermons by Ismail Osman Sindai, a radical Kurdish imam, calling for attacks against stores selling alcohol and massage parlours in Zakho. The riots soon developed into the looting and burning down of Assyrian- and Yazidi-owned properties in other towns in the governorate, causing four million dollars of damage.Ankawa: مصدر: نحو 4 ملايين دولار حجم الخسائر الناجمة عن إحراق الأماكن السياحية في أحداث دهوك The riots ended after Kurdistan Regional Government security forces intervened and began a massive crackdown on demonstrators. As a result of the riots, a group of secular Kurds attacked a number of buildings belonging to the Kurdistan Islamic Union party. Background Assyrian personalities in the region had been wary of the changes of the Arab Spring, particularity the rise of radical Islamism. The riots started in Zakho, the northernmost town of Iraq, located close to the Turkish border. The town has a majority Kurdish population with a sizeable Assyrian and Yazidi minority.  Friday events  The small riots were instigated by Friday sermons in the northern city of Zakho after Muslim clerics called for the destruction of stores that sold alcohol in the city on December 2, 2011. Angry youth mobs attacked Assyrian- and Yazidi-owned businesses such as stores, hotels, casinos, and massage parlors in the northern town of Zakho. The violence spilled into nearby towns of Duhok and Semel. Many Assyrian social clubs and homes were also attacked throughout the province. Angry Kurdish pro-government supporters that belonged to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Kurdistan Democratic Party suspected Muslim Brotherhood-inspired Kurdistan Islamic Union (KIU) clerics to be behind the violence and attacked offices of the Islamic party in Duhok and Erbil overnight. However, in an official statement, the KIU denied any connections to the riots. The riots ended three days later with the strong response from the Kurdistan Regional Government.

Tonally, Talkback was a parody of America's traditional call-in radio talk shows of the early 1970's. Such shows in that era were always devoted to serious topics. In 1975 Jerry Galvin began a weekly program that used what he termed a \\"radio scam\\" as the show's theme each week. Each weekly show was launched with Galvin telling a stream-of-consciousness, unscripted – often long and rambling – story about something that happened to him or about to happen to the listeners or to the world. The stories were never true. Once the phone lines were opened for comments, two distinct types of callers were heard. Those who got the joke and improvisationally advanced that night's fake story. And those upset or outraged by the story. Unlike its spiritual TV sister Fernwood 2-Night, a mostly scripted show with a crew of writers, Talkback was improvised. (Late Night with David Letterman, a real TV talk show which was finding its footing around the same time, had a similar parodical feel, but was somewhat reined in by its celebrity guest format.) Host Galvin was a Cincinnati ad executive best known for teaming up with Jay Gilbert to create commercials promoting all Cincinnati radio stations with their imaginary Plummet Mall. The Talkback \\"cast\\" consisted of several dozen regulars, many of whom would call weekly to play along with whatever phony topic or riff Jerry set up. After the show developed its stable of regular callers, shows would sometimes be built around the regulars themselves interacting, such as on-air wedding ceremonies between them. Tipping his hand and hinting at the show's parodical nature, Jerry often described his clothing as \\"the same each day: Hush Puppy knockoffs, argyle socks, plaid Bermuda shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a pith helmet.\\" Jerry often teased the station where his show originated by referring to WAIF as a station with a signal so weak the best reception was in the parking lot. He also described his most famous screener, Lynn Wendell as \\"Our Lady in Leather,\\" wearing leather S&M; gear (in contrast to most radio talk shows whose official on-air policy was not to mention the screener at all)--a reference to her toughness and tendency to hang up on anyone who didn't have a funny enough idea to keep the show moving. In the 1980s after Talkback received a front page feature in the Wall Street Journal and was also featured on the Today Show, the program was nationally distributed to National Public Radio stations. The name of the show was changed to TalkTalk with Jerry Galvin after producers of a Los Angeles show named Talkback threatened a lawsuit. The program underwent one more name change to \\"It's Those Stupid Galvins Again,\\" when Jerry's brother Jene joined Jerry for the weekly programs that by then aired on WVXU in Cincinnati. The improvisational, scam-based format remained unchanged throughout the show's more than 30-year run.

Between source and mouth its length is . Route The beck begins at Constable Burton with the confluence of three becks (Bellerby and Burton, Whipperdale and a third unnamed beck), all of which rise in the upland north of Leyburn, with Bellerby Beck spilling off the moor above the village of Bellerby. At Constable Burton it flows under the A684 road and between there and Patrick Brompton it is shown on maps as Burton Beck, Leeming Beck and Newton Beck. At Crakehall it is also named Crakehall Beck. It takes on the name Bedale Beck proper just east of Crakehall before it flows south under the new A684 bypass and into the town of Bedale, where it forms the boundary between the civil parishes of Aiskew and Bedale. After Bedale it flows east then north, going under the A6055 road and the A1(M) before changing direction and going east along the northern edge of RAF Leeming. It joins the River Swale between Morton-on-Swale and Gatenby. History The beck was the location of water mills, at least two being recorded in the Bedale area by 1297. The most famous is the mill that still exists at Crakehall, which was renovated in 1980 and again in the new millennium and grinds corn on special open days. Both of the mills at Aiskew and Crakehall had millraces. Crakehall's is still there and transports water. The mill at Aiskew had closed but was reopened in 2010 as a community bakery. In the 18th century an attempt was made to make the beck navigable from Bedale to the River Swale. The plan was abandoned owing to a lack of investment and in 1855 the railway was opened, which superseded the plans for a canal. The area below the weir and the sluice gate are still known as 'The Harbour'. The scheme was part of a grander plan to convert the Swale into a navigation from the River Ure up to Bedale, which involved installing a lock just west of Leeming village, known as Leeming Lock. The lock survived until it was blown up in the Second World War, though no-one knows if it was deliberate or accidental. The plan also meant diverting the watercourse that flows past Floodbridge Farm and now joins Bedale Beck further downstream than previously. Flooding on the beck has led to problems. In 1901 floodwaters undermined the trackbed of the railway line west of Bedale, causing a locomotive to derail and killing its fireman. Ecology Along with others that feed into the River Swale in Hambleton, Bedale Beck has been identified as having poor ecological quality and having too much sediment entering the water, which damages the habitat for fish, raises phosphate levels and contributes to flooding. Both Bedale and Leeming have been identified as being the main receptors of flooding along the beck owing to their low-lying and flat nature (especially between Bedale and Leeming, which has been described as a 'level floodplain') in comparison to the rest of the beck's course.

Booking is a practice in which waiters bring female patrons, sometimes forcibly, to a table to sit with men. Both parties are free to leave at any time, or depending on mutual interest, they can continue to sit together and drink and talk. Although outwardly similar, to outsiders, these are not hostess clubs, and although the men are expected to tip and pay their waiters to bring women to their table, the women are not employees nor are they prostitutes but fellow clubbers. Background Confucianism in Korea has had a profound effect on social interactions, in traditional Confucianism one was expected to give proper deference and respect to one another based on one's position within a five level hierarchy, only the bottom of which was of one between equals, one's position in this hierarchy was based on a mix of one's ancestry, family position, official offices if any and social status. With regards to marriage one was expected to find a partner of the same social status as one's own, an appropriate partner being one whose status was neither above nor beneath one's own, to facilitate this there was the traditional matchmaker. As South Korea urbanised and industrialised, the hierarchical stratification of society remained, in addition to ancestry one's social position in Korean society now includes the level of one's education, alma mater, profession, which company one works for and one's position and seniority (whether one is a seonbae or hubae) within the company. Increasingly less so, social interactions would become paralysed unless people were properly introduced and so could determine one's social position with regards one another, fear of behaving inappropriately to one's own position leading to an outright refusal to interact with strangers. With regards to marriage meeting people outside one's established social circle is difficult, and within this circle, for example with colleagues, one is constrained by what would be considered appropriate and inappropriate relationships depending on one's seniority and position in the hierarchy. The old professional matchmakers still exist, and friends and family will act as informal matchmakers, however even when both parties are interested in meeting a member of the opposite sex, such as when clubbing, a Korean would find it difficult to ask a stranger for a dance, a date, or more, and those who do would be seen negatively by the more conservative. Booking arose therefore as an icebreaker between individuals who would otherwise be too embarrassed to approach one another and has been described as a form of speed dating. As South Koreans have become more comfortable with other ways to meet new people, such as through the internet, booking clubs have declined. Practice In booking clubs groups of men will pay for a booth or room, the higher priced they are the better placed they are to observe the dance floor, they will also order a set of drinks and snacks for their table. The male groups are assigned a waiter who for tips will try and bring female patrons to their table, if they see a specific girl on the dance floor that they are interested in they may ask their waiter to try and bring her to their table. Although to outsiders, these clubs have been mistaken for hostess clubs, the women are not employees nor are they prostitutes but fellow clubbers, they are free to leave at any time, and male patrons should not make the mistake that their payment to the waiter, however much it may be, entitles them to anything but the opportunity to introduce themselves, or that it relieves them of the need to be gentlemen. Among both male and female patrons there will be those who want more than some drinks, conversation and an exchange of phone numbers, it is the job of the waiter therefore to try and match only those with similar intentions. Criticism Ahn Hyeong-hwan (안형환), the Grand National Party representative and the member of the parliamentary-level Committee on Culture, Sports, Tourism, Broadcasting & Communications raised the issue of how the English- language Arirang TV presented the concept of booking to viewers, and how it could potentially portray as negative an aspect of Korean contemporary culture. Outside of Korea In the United States, Le Prive was a popular Korean-American venue for booking.

He was born in Wapello County, Iowa. He died in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, of a heart attack following influenza.Dictionary of American Biography, Volume XI, Part 2, Supplement 2 p. 551-552 Early career Reno grew up in Iowa, in a family influenced by Populist politics. Reno was involved in organizing farmers. In 1918, he joined the Iowa Farmer Union and in 1921, he was elected its president. He called for better prices for farmers and public works programs, supported by a more inflationary monetary policy. He supported Democratic Party candidates in both the 1928 elections (Al Smith) and the 1932 elections (Franklin Roosevelt). He later turned against Roosevelt and the Democratic Party and bitterly criticized the New Deal by supporting such figures as Father Coughlin.The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa Farmers' Holiday Association Reno's public persona is largely shaped by his leadership of the Farmers' Holiday Association, a Depression-era organization of farmers based in the Midwest that campaigned for populist measures including currency inflation, agricultural production, prices controls, and an end to foreclosures. In October 1933, in reaction against the federal Agricultural Adjustment Act, Reno led the call for a \\"farm strike\\" until the demands were met.

A kafenio typically serves various types of Greek coffee, including Greek coffee and frappé, as well as beer, retsina, and ouzo. Most kafenia provide meze or free snacks and rarely serve full meals. Kafenia were traditionally family-run businesses and furnished simply. The walls are often whitewashed. Kafenia often serve as social centers of the villages and islands where they are located. People socialize after work or play a game of cards. In previous centuries, the kafenio was a place where women were not welcome but now kafenia are frequented by girls and women. Etymology The word comes from earlier Greek καφενές, which is borrowed from Turkish kahvehane or kahvene (\\"coffeehouse\\"), which is in turn derived from the Persian qahveh-khaneh (< Arabic qahve 'coffee' + Persian khane 'house').Λεξικό της κοινής νεοελληνικής, s.v. καφενεíο and s.v. καφενές Other Balkan languages have also borrowed the Turkish term, as kafana, kavane, kaveana, etc. See also * Coffee shop References Category:Greek cuisine ","title":"Kafenio"},{"id":"33944038","text":"Justynian Niemirowicz Szczytt (also spelled Szczyt and Szczyth; died 1677) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic), a chamberlain (podkomorzy) of Polotsk and a deputy to the sejm (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For many years he was a servant of the magnate Sapieha family. He was vice wojewoda (vice governor) of Polotsk (probably 1666-70) and chamberlain (podkomorzy) of Polotsk from 1673. Szczytt was a sejm deputy in 1667, 1668, 1669, 1670 and 1674. He was also a founder of the Franciscan cloister at Prozaroki (Polish Prozoroki). Family Justynian Szczytt was a member of the Szczytt family, which used Jastrzębiec as its coat of arms (although according to Kasper Niesiecki, it was not Jastrzębiec, but Radwan). Justynian's great- grandfather was Mikołaj Szczytt, wojski of Witebsk, who spent 15 years in captivity in Moscow. Justynian was the son of Krzysztof Szczytt, owner of Białe in Polotsk Voivodeship, and his wife Zofia Lissowski. After the death of Krzysztof Szczytt, Zofia married Józef Skinder. Justynian Szczytt had five siblings: three brothers—Jan (d. between 15 October 1668 and 23 April 1672), Mikołaj (wojski of Mścisław, d. 1676), and Aleksander—and two sisters—Anna and Halszka. Information of Justynian Szczytt's sons in Herbarz polski by Kasper Niesiecki Justynian Szczytt married Anna Joanna Tukowicz (d. 1694), daughter of Bazyli Tukowicz, in 1648. They had six sons: * Konstanty Marcjan, b. about 1649, d. 17 or 22 October 1712; podsędek (deputy district judge) of Polotsk, elector of Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, Jan III Sobieski and August II * Bronisław, d. between 2 June 1668 and 1675 * Krzysztof Benedykt, d. 1720; castellan of Smolensk * Samuel Karol, d. 24 December 1709 * Albrecht (Olbracht, Olbrycht), d. 22 August 1694; podstoli of Smolensk * Kazimierz, b. 29 November 1664, d. 8 September 1708; Jesuit. Life Nothing is known about the date or place of Justynian Szczytt's birth, nor his education and youth. He was a servant of the magnat Sapieha family for many years, particularly of Paweł Jan Sapieha and his son Benedykt Paweł Sapieha. He administered property in Czereje in their names from 1667 to 1669. By 22 June 1666, he had become Polotsk's vice-voivode (podwojewodzi, literally: under-voivode). In 1667, Szczytt was elected for the first time as a member of the sejm walny (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a representative of the Połock Voivodeship. The following year he served as a member of parliament twice: first in the extraordinary parliament (sejm ekstraordynaryjny) and again in the abdication sejm after King Jan Kazimierz abdicated the throne. Election of Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki Szczytt was member of parliament during the election sejm of 1669, which elevated Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki to the Polish throne. According to family tradition, Szczytt saw that people were giving new king an ordinary-looking szabla. He gave the king his own very ornamental sabre. Eventually the szabla was returned to Szczytt, and it remained a family heirloom until the 1880s. Also in 1669, Szczytt was a member of the coronation sejm. He tried to stop the proceedings of parliament for an unknown reason on 25 October 1669, but the following day he retracted his objection on the condition that the Połock Voivodeship be exempt from taxes for a period of six years. By 29 July 1670, Kazimierz Jan Sapieha, Połock's new voivode, named Szczytt the new podwojewodzi. Historians believe Sapieha did so in exchange for Szczytt's property in Lisna. Also in 1670, Szczytt was a judge of the Lithuanian Tribunal. In June 1670, on behalf of the Sapieha family, he accused Mikołaj Ciechanowiecki, Marshall of the Tribunal, of several crimes, including being elected illegally. Then Szczytt left Wilno and paralysed the Tribunal for some time. Eventually, the Tribunal won the support the magnate Pac family and Szczytt was banished. That same year, Szczytt was a member of parliament. Between 6 June and 10 August 1673 he became Polotsk's podkomorzy (chamberlain). As podkomorzy he was known from his judiciousness. He became known as sprawiedliwy Szczyt (\\"Justice Szczytt\\"). During election Sejm of 1674 he voted for Jan III Sobieski. In 1677 Szczytt brought the Franciscan Brothers to Prozaroki, where he built them a cloister and church. Justynian Szczytt died in 1677 (although Teodor Żychliński states that Szczytt died about 1681). He was buried in the Franciscan church in Prozaroki. Estate Szczytt was an owner of the several villages. From his father he inherited Białe. Later he bought some more: Truchonowicz, Kozłów and Słobódki from Jerzy Atełchowski, Hubin and island on Otułow's river from Jakub Iwanowicz Suprynowicz Bużycki and his wife Halsza in 1654. Szczytt was also owner of parts of some villages. He bought part of Tabołki and Prozaroki from his brother-in-law Stefan Tukowicz (first in 1663, second in 1666) and part of Sanniki from Michał Skarżyński in 1674. He was also mentioned as owner of Komorowszczyzna, Ołoskowo and Pohorełe. Justynian Szczytt had as lien the following villages: Doroszkowice (Dorozińce), Babcze, Czerniewicz, Woroszki, Mamonowszczyzna, Szypiłłowszczyzma, Świerzno and Dziernowice. Szczytt divided his property among his sons in 1675.

The clashes began following the twin bombings in Aleppo city on 10 February 2012, which were conducted by the jihadist anti-government organisation, the Al-Nusra Front. Over the next five months, major clashes left large parts of the rural countryside under rebel control, with the capital of the province, Aleppo city, still being firmly under government control. On 19 July, rebel forces stormed the city and a battle for control of Syria's largest city and economic hub had begun.  Background  There were anti-government protests in Aleppo, reported since 13 April 2011. However, the city itself was mostly peaceful and spared the violence of the war, unlike the rest of the country, being a government stronghold for the better part of the first year of the conflict.Survivor describes new Syria mass killing Anti- government activists called for a huge turnout on 30 June, although two small protests were held that day with only 1,000 demonstrators showing up. On 12 August, Syrian security forces fired at protesters in the Sakhur neighborhood, killing four people. On 17 August, \\"thousands\\" protested in the central square (Saadallah al-Jabiri square) of Aleppo and in other parts of the city. Opposition activists claimed that the security forces again opened fire at the protesters. On 6 September, there were reportedly huge crowds (20,000–40,000) protesting against the government after the killing of the Syrian Sunni Sheikh Ibrahim Salqini. On 27 September, the government stormed Aleppo with tanks. On 21 December, four protests were reportedly held at the university, where a student at the Faculty of Science was reportedly killed by government forces.  Bombings  On 6 January 2012, the head of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria warned that the government was plotting a bombing in the city, \\"just to terrorize the people\\". Ammar Qurabi told Al Arabiya that he had learned about the alleged plot from Syrian security officials. This came after bombings in Damascus in December 2011 and in January 2012. Qurabi and other opposition groups accused the government of staging those attacks to justify its crackdown on the uprising. On 10 February, twin bomb attacks targeted the military intelligence building in Aleppo and killed 24 members of the security forces.Syria says suicide bombers kill 28 in attacks on security HQs in Aleppo  Armed clashes  Green triangles denote key settlements taken by opposition forces.

It was active from 1861 until 1943. It was the first public institution of higher academic learning open to women in Sweden. The Royal Normal School for Girls (') was a secondary school attached to the Royal Seminary. It served as a feeder program for the seminary and was the first public girls' school in the country. History The Royal Seminary was founded after the so-called Hertha debate over women's rights prompted by Fredrika Bremer's 1856 novel Hertha. Swedish women (unless widowed or divorced) were then considered to be incompetent wards of their husbands, fathers or brothers under the Civil Code of 1734 and could be granted legal majority only by a personal petition to the Crown. The novel argued against that and supported female admission to institutions of higher education, ultimately successfully on both counts. The Swedish Parliament permitted women to petition their local courthouses instead of the king in 1858, and it finally granted legal majority to all women over the age of 25 in 1863. The call for entry to higher education was answered first by Stockholm's 1859 ('). Subsidised by influential men, the course provided free lectures and private recitations for elective classes covering religion, natural science, mathematics, history, grammar, literature, French, personal hygiene, and drawing. When this proved hugely popular, it was expanded into a full normal school. On 23 December 1909, the philanthropist and social activist Maria Ribbing, one of the students of the Course of Education for Women, commented to the feminist magazine Dagny about her experience half a century previously: :\\"The Youth of today, who has perhaps sometimes satidsfied their thirst of knowledge to the point of oversaturation, can not begin to understand the hunger for real knowledge that lived in so many women of that time.\\"Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 The Royal Seminary for the Training of Female Teachers (') was inaugurated on 1 October 1861 and also free. In addition to the subjects provided by its predecessor, it offered courses in German, English, geography, natural philosophy and pedagogy. The first head of the institution was Hilda Elfving, the governess of the royal princess Louise. It was organized along new lines by Jane Miller Thengberg in 1864, which made it the focus of study trips from other schools nationwide.Jane Miller Thengberg, urn:sbl:9352, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Gunilla Karlsson), hämtad 2015-01-03. The foremost purpose of the seminary was the training of female teachers for public elementary schools and girls' schools. The study period was three years, with a voluntary additional year. In 1873, the other Swedish universities were opened to women, but female students were initially rare. In the 1880s, the Royal Seminary was still described as the foremost centre for female higher education.A Gurli Linder, urn:sbl:10521, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lena Kåreland), hämtad 2015-01-03. It became increasingly obsolete as women gained greater access to other institutions, however, and was finally closed in 1943. Royal Normal School for Girls The Royal Normal School for Girls opened on 1 October 1864. It acted as a feeder programme and training ground for the Royal Seminary. The headmaster of the Royal Seminary acted as its principal, but it also had its own head teacher, who was always to be a female. Both of them were under the supervision of a directory of the state.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 It was the first public girls' school in the country and admitted girls with at least 4 years of elementary education.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 The levels were six (initially five) of which the middle four levels lasted two years, which amounted to 10 classes in all.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 Of the eleven classes available, three were defined as preparatory classes, and eight to the elementary classes.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 After eight years of study, students took the normal school graduation, which was roughly equivalent to that of the graduation of a male student from the gymnasium).

In the advertisement, a series of actors set against a backdrop of clouds and lightning speak about the ways that \\"gay marriage\\" activism has cut into freedom of religion and parental rights. Background The ad aired after California's Proposition 8, eliminating the right of same-sex couples to marry, passed in public election after having been behind in the polls. During the run-up to the vote, an advertisement aired saying schoolchildren would be taught about gay marriage should the proposition fail. \\"Gathering Storm\\" targeted Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Maine and Rhode Island. Content The actors in the ad (who are described as actors in on-screen text; many were Mormon activists) mention the following cases: # A California doctor who is forced to choose between her religious faith and her work; # A member of a New Jersey church group which is punished by the state for opposing same-sex marriage; # A Massachusetts parent who is unable to prevent the state from teaching her children that same-sex marriage is appropriate; The first actor refers to the Benitez case, where an unmarried lesbian sued a fertility clinic under California's Civil Rights Act for declining to artificially inseminate her. The clinic's doctors argued that the Act was unconstitutional insofar as it required them to perform procedures in violation of their religious beliefs. The California Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act did not violate the free exercise clauses of the United States Constitution or the California Constitution. The second actor refers to an Ocean Grove, NJ controversy, in which the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused a lesbian couple use of a pavilion for a civil union ceremony. The state ruled that the group could not receive a tax exemption for the pavilion under the state's Green Acres Program, which is intended to encourage availability of property for public use. The Association's beachfront property other than the pavilion itself retained the tax exemption. The Association was assessed approximately $20,000 in back taxes on the pavilion,Berg, Thomas C.

The lawsuit was filed after the son of one set of plaintiffs \\"brought home a book as part of the diversity book bag from his Estabrook Elementary kindergarten class in 2005 [that] showed various family types including a same-sex-headed household.\\" Another set of plaintiffs' first-grade son was in class when the book King & King, in which a prince marries another prince, was read aloud. One of the plaintiff parents attended a school board meeting to request that he be notified anytime homosexuality was brought up in his son's class; after that request was declined, the parent refused to leave the building and was jailed overnight. The school board later obtained a restraining order barring the parent from entering onto school property. Judge Mark L. Wolf of Federal District Court found against the plaintiffs, stating in his decision that schools are \\"entitled to teach anything that is reasonably related to the goals of preparing students to become engaged and productive citizens\\"; federal courts did not overturn the decision on appeal. Reaction The Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) lobbying group and political action committee, described the ad saying that in it \\"actors make disproven claims about marriage for lesbian and gay couples.\\" New York Times columnist Frank Rich described the ad as \\"an Internet camp classic\\". It was parodied by Stephen Colbert, the website Funny or Die (using actors Jane Lynch, George Takei, Sarah Chalke, Lance Bass, Sophia Bush and Alicia Silverstone), and in the Futurama episode \\"Proposition Infinity\\".

It was released on November 15, 2011 on DVD and Blu-ray, along with another original animated short film Book of Dragons. Based on How to Train Your Dragon, the short takes place in the middle of preparing for the Viking winter holiday. After all dragons inexplicably fly away, the last one of them unwittingly kidnaps Hiccup. Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse all reprise their roles from the original film. Plot Right before Berk's traditional winter holiday of Snoggletog, all the dragons of Berk unexpectedly depart, leaving everyone distraught - except for Toothless, who cannot fly by himself. Out of compassion, Hiccup builds him a new automatic prosthesis allowing him independent flight, thus gifting him his freedom; he then flies off too. Three days later, Meatlug, Fishlegs' dragon whom he had secretly kept chained, escapes, inadvertently taking Hiccup with him. Meatlug flies to an island with hot springs, where all the dragons (except Toothless, who is nowhere to be found) have been hatching their eggs. Meanwhile, on Berk, Astrid and the other youth discover dragon eggs in Meatlug's nest, which they scatter around Berk in hopes of lifting the villagers' spirits; this plan backfires because dragon eggs hatch explosively (normally underwater), devastating Berk during the process. On the dragons' island, Hiccup meets Stormfly (Astrid's dragon) and Hookfang (Snotlout's dragon) and their newly-hatched babies; in asking for a ride home, he inadvertently triggers the dragons' return migration. He quickly decides to use a nearby wrecked ship to carry the baby dragons who cannot yet fly all the way back to Berk. The Berkians are overjoyed at their dragons' return and the new babies; yet, Hiccup is still distraught at Toothless' absence. During the ensuing Snoggletog celebration, Toothless returns with Hiccup's lost helmet, which he had dropped into the sea earlier; the two enjoy a heartfelt reunion. The next day, Toothless destroys his new tail, begging Hiccup to put the old tailfin on him and fly with him by controlling his fin manually as opposed to merely on him; in doing so, he gives Hiccup a \\"better gift\\" - his friendship and companionship.

For his patriotic activity he received the highest Albanian award, 'Honour of the Nation' as well as that of 'Teacher of the People'. Nivica was born in Rexhin village in the southern Ottoman Albania, today's Tepelenë.  Early life  Nivica went to school in Monastir (1904-1907) where he was inspired by the rebel Bajo Topulli. After that he went in Yannina where he joined the Greek-language Zosimea school (1907–09). He went in Durrës to teach there for a short time (1909–10). During this time he was increasingly caught up by the Albanian nationalist movement. During 1911–12 he was involved with anti-Ottoman activities and uprisings in southern Albania. For that he would be arrested and imprisoned in Istanbul. However, he was soon released with the intervention of Ismail Bey Vlora and managed to arrange himself to teach Albanian at the Robert College. Nivica returned to Albania after independence and together with Mustafa Hilmi Leskoviku (1887–1915), also known as Muço Qulli, he funded the newspaper Populli (\\"The people\\") in Vlorë (1914) and shortly moved to Shkodër. The end of World War I would find him there. Nivica was a member of the National Literature Organization, and the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo (CNDS) until his death. He continued as the editor-in-chief of the Albanian patriotic newspaper Populli restarted in early 1919. It was published in Shkodër, with strong nationalistic notes supporting the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo. The first issue came out on January 18, 1919, with the slogan \\"Për lavdinë e Atdheut\\" (\\"For the glory of the nation\\"). It served somehow as a de facto journal of the Committee. During all its activity the newspaper propagandized Albanian ethnic unity, the Albanian national cause, and called for the liberation of Kosovo from the Serbs. His nationalistic activity would aggravate his relationship with neighboring countries, especially with Italy which had most of Albania under protectorate. He was killed in Shkodër by a gunman named Kolë Ashiku allegedly commissioned by the Italian Consulate. A contemporary Albanian activists, Sejfi Vllamasi gives more insight on his assassination. Nivica and Ashiku got angry with each other due to a store-renting business negotiation which did not go well, following with Nivica insulting the counterpart. Ashiku declared that he would resolve things according to the Kanun. His brother Andon, a Catholic priest, notified Hysni Curri (a leader of the Committee) that Ashiku was serious. Both Curri and Nivica neglected the severity of the situation. Though Curri assigned a guard to follow Nivica, Ashiku found him alone in one of the side streets of the town and shot him twice. Nivica managed to fire four shots towards Ashiku, who ran and entered the Italian consulate. Nivica died later in the hospital, to the great delight of the Italians. Although there were rumors that connected Ashiku directly to the Italians, Vllamasi calls the incident \\"an ordinary murder which caused a lot of political damage\\". The day of his funeral the whole town closed the store in his respect. His funeral was attended by a large number of people.

In 2011, Irlam and Cadishead Community High School closed and several buildings were knocked down. It reopened in June 2011 under a new name; Irlam and Cadishead College. The pupils and staff moved next door to a new building. It has a variety of learning spaces, outdoor classrooms, a sports hall, gym and a flood-lit all- weather pitch. There is a community centre on the school grounds where the neighbourhood management team along with staff from the health, youth, arts and park ranger services are all based. In 2015, a new Principal was appointed to prepare the school to join the Salford Academy Trust. During this period the sixth form was closed, student numbers fell, many teaching and support staff left and some walls were built to divide up the open plan spaces. By July 2017 the school had become part of the Salford Academy Trust. The trust began winding down in 2018 and all the trust schools were put out to tender for a new trust.

The Great Storm is a group of four episodes of the Australian soap opera Home and Away, broadcast between 5 and 8 September 2011 on Network Seven, during the show's twenty-fourth season. The episodes focused on a severe storm which crosses over the fictional town of Summer Bay and leaves several of the serial's characters in danger. Home and Away's producer Cameron Welsh first announced intention to screen the storyline in June 2011. It was self-described to be the \\"biggest stunt/disaster storyline\\" to ever feature in the serial. In the months prior to its screening, the cast filmed a series of stunts for the episodes on a shoot lasting eleven days. It marked the first time that Home and Away used a wide combination of special effects such as FX, green screen, wind machines and rain machines. Along with more time than usual spent filming the block of episodes, the storyline became Home and Away's most expensive to date. Welsh said that the use of machinery became problematic during filming so additional dialogue recordings were added to the scenes during post-production. The storyline was promoted by the Seven Network and overseas broadcaster Channel 5, in the form of televisual adverts. One of the serial's cast members revealed that one character would die in the disaster, but details were kept under wraps until transmission. The storyline follows the struggle the characters encounter when the storm hits. Various characters become stranded in different locations while the majority take shelter at Summer Bay High where an evacuation centre is set up. The characters of Harvey Ryan (Marcus Graham) and Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) become stranded when their boat capsizes. While Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell) takes on the role of the \\"hero\\" and tries to save lives. Other segments include the character of Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) nearly losing her unborn child and the roof collapsing at Summer Bay High leaving the characters of Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood), Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing) trapped in the wreckage. When the storm passes guest character Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) is killed in a car accident. The episodes rated well on the Seven Network averaging at 1.131 million viewers for the whole block of episodes. The ratings fared less in the UK staying below the million mark. The storyline was not popular with Erin Miller from TV Week who opined that the special effects used ruined many scenes. Creation and development In June 2011, the serial's producer Cameron Welsh revealed that Home and Away would air a special week of episodes featuring a storm. In July, Welsh told entertainment website Digital Spy that there were plans for the \\"biggest stunt/disaster storyline\\" that production team had ever undertaken. He said they were in the final stages of post-production meaning that it would come to air \\"very soon\\". In August, Rhiannon Fish who plays April Scott told TV Week that the storyline would focus on a \\"deadly storm\\" that crosses the path of Summer Bay. Fish said that filming of the storyline was \\"full on\\" and wind and rain machines were installed on set to create the correct environment. Fish added that the cast felt like they were filming during an actual storm. Ada Nicodemou who plays Leah Patterson-Baker revealed that one character would die in the storm, but was not permitted to reveal their identity. She also said her character Leah would become trapped inside the Pier Diner and worried about the whereabouts of her son VJ Patterson (Felix Dean). As she is pregnant, when she discovers bleeding she presumes that she has miscarried. Nicodemou said the ill turn is down to the stress of the storm. Welsh later revealed more details on the storyline and the effects it would have on the characters. The main storyline threads feature the characters of Harvey Ryan (Marcus Graham) and Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) facing danger when their boat capsizes during \\"rough seas\\". Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) and Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell) then go on the trail to save their lives. The serial's local school, Summer Bay High would become the \\"evacuation centre\\". Then a collapsed roof then traps the characters of Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing).Romeo and Alf's attempts to rescue those on board a capsized boat were filmed at Cattai National Park (pictured) The Great Storm is one of Home and Away's most expensive storylines to date. The episodes were filmed on a budget which was double the amount in costs that are needed to produce a \\"usual block\\" of episodes. Extra money was spent on additional days of shooting, wind and rain machines, FX and Computer-generated imagery. Filming took place for eleven days, five were spent on location while the rest were studio based. The shoot lasted three days extra than the typical number of days required to film. In the filming of the episodic block green screen and special effects were used. Home and Away previously had not used a combination of both, but Welsh said they needed to because it \\"brings the reality of the storm into our studio sets\\". While filming scenes on location shoots they were used to \\"intensify the overall feel of the storm\\". The cast also played out stunts and filmed in excess water. The scenes in which Romeo and Alf rescue characters from a capsized boat were filmed on location at Cattai National Park. Rain machines and light towers were installed. Despite cold conditions Welsh said the cast morale had remained high because they felt they were \\"part of something special\\". Welsh said seeing the cast pull together creating \\"something so massive\\" was a memorable moment. He added that Luke Mitchell had to endure the worst conditions for a prolonged period of time while filming and praised his portrayal. Due to heightened set noise from the wind and rain machines, their cast members dialogue could not be heard in initial filming. A number of weeks later they added additional dialogue recordings to the scenes, this was the \\"biggest difficulty\\" that was faced during the production process. Plot When John Palmer (Shane Withington) hears a severe weather warning issued via the local radio, he sends Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts) to close the beach down. Alone, John collapses from a ruptured spleen. Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman) takes cover in the Austin household where she discovers John unconscious. When the ambulance crews arrive to save John, Sasha steals supplies from the house but is stopped by Xavier. Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) takes charge at the hospital responding to those injured in the storm. Dennis Harling (Daniel Roberts) convinces Harvey and Roo to take his boat out on a business venture with potential clients. Alf and Romeo receive a distress signal from Harvey stating that their boat has capsized. Alf ensembles a response team and heads out to the national park. They find Roo and Dennis when they swim to the shore. Romeo tells Alf to take them to the hospital while he rescues Harvey. Romeo finds Harvey who has a deep laceration to his leg and is losing blood. When they attempt to drive back a tree fall ditches Romeo's vehicle and falls to the edge of a cliff. Romeo eventually manages to drag the car out of the ditch and seeks medical treatment for Harvey. Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) and Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) take shelter in the Pier Diner. Leah is worried when her son VJ Patterson (Felix Dean) goes missing, but Elijah finds him on the beach. Leah feels ill and tells Elijah that she is bleeding and thinks she has lost her unborn baby. Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) and Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) set up a shelter at Summer Bay High. Heath arrives seeking shelter with his daughter Darcy Callahan (Alea O'Shea). Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) arrives in search of Darcy, she is annoyed that Heath took her without permission and drives off with her. Water begins to leak into the school and Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) warns everyone that the storm is getting worse, though she is ignored. When the problem water gain worsens Gina decides to evacuate everyone to the other side of the school. Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) and Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) are nearly injured as part of the roof falls behind them. As they run, Bianca stands under the remaining segment of roofing. Heath plunges to save Bianca as the roof caves in on top of them. They remain trapped under the wreckage for a while, but rescue teams manage to save them. Colleen is found trapped using a lavatory which she rushed to use because of stress. Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) attends a car accident in which Tegan is trapped in. Tegan cannot break free as she is trapped under the steering wheel. After she is cut out of the wreckage, she is taken to hospital for surgery where she later dies. As the storm passes the residents of Summer Bay come to terms with the events and begin the clean-up operation. Promotion To promote the storyline, the Seven Network issued two televisual advertisements which were broadcast on their station. They began airing in August advertising the start date for the storyline. The first showed Summer Bay in a calm setting with a warning of The Great Storm arriving. While the other profiled previous disaster style storylines which Home and Away had featured, with the addition of The Great Storm. It also featured preview clips and interviews with the cast talking about the scenes. The promotion revealed that the roof at Summer Bay High would collapse, a car would slip to the edge of a cliff and showed various character battling severe storm conditions. The serial UK broadcaster Channel 5 released an advert in October before they were due to air the scenes. The clip featured several scenes from the episodes. Ratings and reception The first episode of The Great Storm was the third most watched programme in Australia averaging at 1.208 million viewers. The second episode featuring Romeo and Alf's rescue mission average at 1.176 million viewers. The third episode featuring the roof collapse at Summer Bay High averaged at 1.09 million. While the serial's fourth outing saw a considerable drop averaging at 707 thousand viewers. The end of week ratings report concluded that Home and Away performed well on the Seven Network averaging at 1.131 million. The first gained 998,000 while the second dropped to 870,000 with the third and fourth steadying onto 893,000 and 824,000 viewers. A columnist from TV Central said that The Great Storm was the Seven Network's \\"highly anticipated television event\\" and added that Summer Bay was \\"hit like never before\\" compared to previous disaster plots. Erin Miller of TV Week had a mixed reaction to the episodes. While it was \\"great to see Summer Bay deal with a natural disaster\\" that created many \\"tense moments\\", Miller said that the special effects ruined various scenes. She opined that Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) was left to play \\"the irritating self-absorbed character\\" as usual. Miller commented that Romeo triumphed as the \\"hero\\" of the storyline when he saves Harvey's life. In the Inside Soap Yearbook 2012 \\"The Great Storm\\" was chosen as the \\"big moment\\" of October 2011 in UK soaps. Their columnist said that the storyline made a \\"spectacular week\\" of episodes centered around the \\"powerful\\" storm that left \\"despair and destruction\\" in its path. They said \\"we were on the edge of our seats as we waited to find out if the tempest would take anyones life.\\" References External links * The Great Storm at the Official AU Home and Away website * The Great Storm at the Official UK Home and Away website Category:2011 Australian television episodes Category:Home and Away Category:Soap opera episodes Category:Soap opera storylines ","title":"The Great Storm (Home and Away)"},{"id":"33944288","text":"\\"First Christmas\\" is the eleventh episode of the first season of the American television comedy series Up All Night.

Some media critics have said that the goal for moving the series was in order to make it more of a ratings success, like The Office. Reception Ratings \\"First Christmas\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on December 7, 2011. The episode was viewed by an estimated 4.95 million viewers and received a 1.9 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a 20% percent rise in the 18-49 demo from the previous episode, \\"Week Off\\" which aired as a special, while it only rose slightly from the previous regular episode, \\"Hiring and Firing\\". The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot and was able to beat only a rerun of The CW reality series, America's Next Top Model which received a 0.5 rating/1% share in the 18–49 demographic. Up All Night became the second highest-rated program on NBC that night, finishing with a higher rating than a rerun of this series and Harry's Law, but a lower rating than Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Reviews Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams wrote that the episode felt like a pilot for new viewers and also wrote that it proved the series had found its footing. Despite this, he also noted that previous episodes worked better as an introduction to the series for new viewers. He called the Reagan plot the best executed plot of the episode while he called the Chris plot sloppily made compared to previous similar plots of the series. He ultimately gave the episode a C+. Paste writer Adam Victavage complimented the writers for being able to use a sitcom staple and make it seem original and \\"semi-realistic\\" and called it one of the few believable NBC comedies. He also complimented the \\"pleasant twist\\" to the Ava-Kevin subplot which featured Ava spying on Kevin. He ultimately gave the episode a 7.9/10, calling the episode \\"commendable\\".

The Fredrika Bremer Association (, abbreviated FBF) is the oldest women's rights organisation in Sweden. It is a member of the International Alliance of Women, which has general consultative status with the United Nations. Activity The FBF works with forming public opinion in favor of gender equality by information and activities, and by handing out money from various funds and scholarships. It collaborates with other organisations with similar goals both nationally and internationally. The FBF had a representative in the governmental council of equality. History The organisation was founded in 1884 by a group largely consisting of the board of the women's magazine Home Review. It consisted of the feminist Sophie Adlersparre, Ellen Anckarsvärd, Fredrika Limnell, Ellen Fries, Hans Hildebrand and G. Sjöberg. It was named in honor of the Swedish novelist Fredrika Bremer, whose novel Hertha was responsible for the legislation emancipating unmarried women from wardship of their male relatives. It also led to the foundation of Gothenburg's Women's Association in Sweden's second city of Gothenburg, which was founded as a local answer to the FBF. The purpose of the organisation was to support women's rights, to inform women of their rights and to encourage them to use them. At the time of its foundation, for example, the focus was to inform women of their rights to serve in the boards of public institutions, and of the rights of women of a certain income to vote in municipal elections and to use those rights. By 1890, the office of the organisation in Stockholm functioned as an employment agency for women of the middle classes, and offered juridical, economical and medical information and advice to women. It was also noted at that time, that many women came there to be informed of the movement for women suffrage. In 1899, a delegation from the FBF presented a suggestion of woman suffrage to prime minister Erik Gustaf Boström. The delegation was headed by Agda Montelius, accompanied by Gertrud Adelborg, who had written the demand. This was the first time the Swedish women's movement themselves had officially presented a demand for suffrage. In 1890, the Svenska drägtreformföreningen became a part of the FBA, and in 1896, the Married Woman Property Association was merged in the association. Publications The FBF published the women's magazine Dagny, which succeeded Adlersparre's Home Review in 1886. This publication was renamed Hertha in 1914 and was the oldest women's magazine in the world when it was discontinued in the late 1990s.

He was trained in Britain during a racing career that lasted from 1880 until June 1882 during which he ran eleven times and won seven races. As a three-year-old in 1881 he proved himself to be the outstanding colt of the season in Europe, winning the Grand Prix de Paris and becoming the second of only three horses to complete the Autumn Double of the Cesarewitch and the Cambridgeshire. Background Foxhall was bred by the Alexander family at the Woodburn Stud in Kentucky. He was bought as a yearling by James R. Keene, who named the colt after his son. His sire was King Alfonso, a leading American stallion who got the Kentucky Derby winners Fonso and Joe Cotton. In March 1880 Keene sent thirteen horses by transatlantic steamer to be trained in England. These included Lord Murphy and Spendthrift as well as eleven Kentucky-bred two-year- olds. In England, Foxhall was trained by William Day near Woodyates on the border of Dorset and Wiltshire. Racing career 1880: two-year-old season Foxhall ran three times as a two-year-old in England. He won the Bedford Stakes at Newmarket and finished second to Savoyard in the Ashley Stakes. In late October at the Newmarket Houghton meeting he carried top weight of 124 pounds in the Bretby Nursery Handicap. Ridden by Charles Wood, he won by a head from the favourite Heyday, to whom he was conceding 28 pounds. 1881: three-year-old season Foxhall was not entered in the Classics or any of the major weight-for-age races in England. He was therefore aimed at the major handicap prizes, beginning with the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom on 27 April. Carrying 91 pounds he finished second of the twenty-four runners, beaten one and a half lengths by the 1880 Epsom Derby winner Bend Or. His performance prompted the Daily Telegraph to express the opinion that Foxhall was the best three-year-old seen in public that year. On 12 June, Foxhall was sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. Foxhall was ridden by George Fordham and started at odds of 2/1 for the 3000m race. Foxhall went to the front from the start and led into the straight where he repelled the persistent challenge of the English colt Tristan (ridden by Fred Archer) to win by a head. The American contingent in the crowd responded to the Foxhall’s victory by going “mad with excitement”, greeting the winner with tremendous applause and much waving of the Stars and Stripes. The French crowd treated the defeat of Tristan as a home victory and joined in the celebrations which were described as “the wildest ever seen at Longchamp”. It was only after the intervention of the local police force that Fordham and Archer were able to return to the weighing room. Keene was reported as saying that he was glad for “American breeding and American horses.” Foxhall's trainer, William Day, who was confined to bed in England with a broken collarbone, reportedly won more than £10,000 in bets on the race. Three days later, Foxhall was back in England for the Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot. He finished fourth of the five runners behind Robert the Devil. In late September, Foxhall won the Grand Duke Michael Stakes and was then entered in the two great handicap races at Newmarket. The first of these was the Czarewitch Stakes over two and a quarter miles, on 11 October in which Foxhall carried 110 pounds. The race was run in a slight drizzle and Foxhall, was held up in the early stages. He was moved up to contest the lead half a mile from the finish and was soon clear of his rivals, winning by ten lengths from Chippendale with Fiddler third. Three days later he took on Tristan in the Select Stakes over one mile and won “in a canter” by three quarters of a length. His win in the Czarewitch meant that Foxhall had to carry a penalty of fourteen pounds for the Cambridgeshire, taking his total weight up to 126 pounds. He started at odds of 10/1 in a field of thirty-two runners which included Bend Or and Tristan. In a closely fought finish, Foxhall, ridden by John Watts won by a head from the filly Lucy Glitters (91 pounds) with Tristan (107) third, setting a weight-carrying record for a horse of any age. A $30,000 match race between Foxhall and Iroquois at Chicago Driving Park was proposed, but did not materialise, although Keene said that he would be happy to take on Iroquois over any distance and considered Foxhall the best three- year-old in the world. 1882: four-year-old season Foxhall did not appear as a four-year-old until 8 June when contested the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot over two and a half miles. He started the 4/9 favourite, with only two horses opposing him; the 2000 Guineas winner Petronel and the three-year-old Faugh-a- Ballagh. Foxhall had to be ridden out by Tom Cannon to win by a neck from Faugh-a-Ballagh. On the following day, Foxhall again started 4/9 favourite, this time for the three mile Alexandra Plate but finished second to Fiddler. He was virtually pulled up in the closing stages and finished the race “very distressed” The relationship between Foxhall's owner and trainer appear to have broken down at this point, with critical articles appearing in both the British and American press. and in November 1882, Keene offered Foxhall for sale with a price of $35,000. The sale offer was later withdrawn, but Foxhall, together with Keene's other British-trained horses, were removed from Day's stable and sent to Richard Marsh at Newmarket, Suffolk. Although Foxhall remained in training with Marsh in 1883 and was entered in several important races he did not appear on the racecourse. He was put on sale again in the autumn of the year. Assessment In the autumn of 1881 Foxhall was rated “the best horse at present on the English Turf”. At around the same time, The Sportsman described him as the best three-year-old of the season. In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Foxhall was ranked twelfth, having been placed in the top ten by twenty-seven of the contributors. William Day regarded Foxhall as the best horse he had ever trained and his win in the Cambridgeshire as \\"the most marvellous performance on record.\\" Stud career Foxhall was not a very successful stallion. The best of his offspring was the filly Cortsorphine who won the Dewhurst Stakes in 1890 and finished second in The Oaks the following year. Foxhall died in 1904 at Lord Roseberry's stud farm.

The short was released on September 20, 1957, and features young boy Ralph Phillips. Following From A to Z-Z-Z-Z (1954), it is one of two cartoons in which he stars.  Plot  The cartoon starts with a baseball going through a window, breaking it, and Ralph exclaiming: \\"Ohhh nooo!\\" His mother sends him up to his bedroom until his father gets home. Up in his room, he broods over his mistake and tries to imagine himself as a hero, first by imagining himself as a famous explorer in Africa to rescue his parents from a native tribe, then tells his father to go to his room for playing in Africa and tells his mother his insurance will cover the window and to buy a catcher's mitt with the rest. He is then seen making paper airplanes, and wishing he was a \\"jet ace or something.\\" He then is imagining himself as an Air Force pilot who thwarts a Martian invasion and is a national hero. His third dream occurs after he hears his dad come home and can hear the distant talking of both of his parents. His imagines himself as a convict in a jail cell. A whispering voice repeats: \\"They're coming to get'cha, Phillips. They're coming to get'cha.\\" He steps down, crushes out a cigarette he was apparently smoking, and faces the door like a man. The cell door opens and a silhouetted person with a booming voice says: \\"You're going to have to pay for this, Ralph Phillips!\\" Back in reality, it turns out to be his rather gentle-demeaning father who informs Ralph that the window repair is coming out of his allowance, then lets him go outside to play. As he runs back outside with a baseball bat and glove, he stops when he sees a cherry tree in the yard, then notices a hatchet. In the next scene he is walking towards the tree with the hatchet, and he turns into a young George Washington as the cartoon irises out. Reception Motion Picture Exhibitor reviewed the short on August 21, 1957: \\"This shows the vivid creation of Ralph, a little boy send to bed for being naughty...

Retrieved 3 December 2011. Preparation After being soaked in water overnight, the cured (or smoked) pork collar is boiled and skimmed, then allowed to simmer with leeks, carrots, celery and cloves for about two hours. A bouquet garni should be included, together with a glass of Moselle wine. For the beans, blanched in water for 5 minutes, a sauce is prepared. Chopped onion, bacon cubes and flour are browned in butter in a saucepan, meat stock is stirred in and the sauce, which should be fairly liquid, is left to simmer for some 20 minutes. The blanched beans are added to the sauce together with finely ground fresh savoury, pepper and salt. When the pork is ready, it is removed from the broth, sliced and arranged on a large plate with the beans.

One possibility, suggested by the linguist Jean-Claude Muller, a member of Luxembourg's Institut grand-ducal, is that it comes from the Spanish word for bean (judía). He explains that in Galicia, there is also a pork dish served with broad beans which is locally called judia pronounced \\"shu-DI-a\\". Muller theorizes that the dish was brought to Luxembourg by Spanish troops during the 16th or 17th centuries.

The stems are covered with minute, star-like hairs and often tinged purple. Considered a weed, it is widely distributed in the tropics, including in Brazil and Southeast Asia.  Description  Each individual plant grows as a single stalk that freely sends out bushy stems. The leaf shape is palmately lobed (having lobes that spread out like fingers on a hand). Like the stem, the leaves also have tiny hairs. Flowers of the plant are pink-violet and grow one centimeter in width. The fruit is also hairy and may stick to clothing or fur.  Invasiveness  The plant can invade areas of ecological disturbance as well as eroded places, crop plantations, and pastures. Caesarweed is considered an invasive species in the state of Florida, United States. There it grows as an annual in most areas except for in the southern region, where it may live perennially. In Florida, the plant has been reported to grow rapidly from to by the end of its first year of growth. The plant is not competitive in tall grasses or under canopies. The University of Florida's pest management procedures for handling this plant include prevention through treating before seeds form and maneuvering vehicles to avoid driving near Caesarweed, mulching and shading to prevent germination, and the use of chemical herbicides.

The entry is notable not for its one- sentence description of its subject (\\"Aguaxima, a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America.\\"), but for Diderot's editorializing that follows it. Frustrated by the uselessness of such a poor article, he muses about what audience it could possibly serve. His conclusion is a succinct critique of the popular assumption that encyclopedias should be measured according to their breadth or comprehensiveness rather than quality. > Aguaxima, a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. > This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom > such descriptions are made.

After graduating, he began work with CBC at the suggestion of a friend; he applied and was hired into the lightning department and eventually rose to the level of producer. He produced such shows as Fighting Words and Background. While working in Toronto, he met lifelong friend Antoinette Bower, who worked at the studio. Though they eventually tried to live together in Bower's home city, Los Angeles, for a time, they did not spend enough time together for the relationship to be viable, as Solway had to spend too much time in Toronto.

Currently based in Europe (primarily Barcelona and Paris), she has toured in Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States.  Biography  Vidal was born in Santa Barbara, California, moved at an early age to Brooklyn, New York, and then to Ithaca, New York where she began studying violin. She started her first band, an all-girl punk group, while a student at Ithaca High School. Her band, Kiev (later changed to Kievan Rus to avoid name conflicts with a California band of the same name), played in two Warped Tour events, and toured briefly with Bad Religion, Anti-Flag, and Gogol Bordello. Bad Religion's Greg Graffin took an early interest in the band, and produced their EP Kievan Rus. The band was cast in a series of Coca-Cola commercial called \\"Girl Band\\" directed by cinematographer Lance Acord that aired in 2005. Mike Viola provided lyrics and musical direction for the commercials, but 'Kiev's' music was used for the series of ads. Various articles referenced the Coke ad highlighting the DIY attitude of the band, the documentary style used by Acord for the Coke \\"Real\\" campaign, and the ironic juxtaposition of a real \\"girl band\\" in an advertisement being more \\"real\\" than the reality TV show \\"American Idol\\" during which it aired. Vidal started a new project, Your Kid Sister, while an art student at Concordia University in Montreal. Your Kid Sister began as an homage to Rancid, her favorite punk band, and she covered Rancid songs in the persona of Tim Armstrong's fictional younger sister. Rancid's ...And Out Come the Wolves was a major influence and during the Your Kid Sister project, Vidal always performed while wearing a wolf hat. Her music video for the song, \\"Poison\\", was made during a summer class at Cornell University taught by animator Lynn Tomlinson. In 2009, Vidal moved to Barcelona and began writing new material while continuing to perform Rancid covers as Your Kid Sister, and playing in other bands. She independently released the album 'Poison: 5 Rancid Songs That I Love' in 2010. Barcelona design company Desigual commissioned Vidal to compose music for the \\"Dreams 2011\\" ad campaign featuring designs by Christian Lacroix. While writing and recording new material she transitioned to using her given name, Maïa Vidal, as her performance name. Her first effort as Maïa Vidal, God Is My Bike was recorded in Barcelona and was released in Europe and Japan by the Belgian label Crammed Discs on October 31, 2011. Guitarist Marc Ribot plays on two of the tracks on the album: \\"God Is My Bike\\", and \\"Le Tango de la Femme Abandonnée\\". Several French and Spanish radio and television programs have interviewed Vidal about her influences and her approach to music. She tours widely in Europe, and recently played 3 sold-out shows in Japan opening for the French artist Zaz. Vidal's 'Follow me' track has been used in the Greek IKEA commercials and in the DKNY fragrance commercial for the fragrance \\"Be Delicious.\\" Positive reviews of the album \\"God Is My Bike\\" include a listing in the influential French rock magazine Les Inrockuptibles as one of their \\"5 groups to follow\\" in which they write, \\"Simple yet twisted, playful and delicate, [Maïa Vidal's] brief pop masterpieces don't evoke any specific territory and don't burden themselves with any roots.\\" Vidal's 'Follow Me' music video was nominated for the UK Music Video Awards in 2012 in the category Best Pop Video International, along with Lana del Rey (who went on to win the award), Rhianna, and Justice. Two of her songs from \\"God Is My Bike\\" (\\"Le Tango de la Femme Abandonnée\\" and \\"The Waltz [Instrumental]\\") were featured in the animated feature \\"The Scapegoats\\" (2013), by independent filmmaker Tor E. Steiro https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2987316/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 In the summer of 2015, the beer company Estrella Damm released a short film entitled \\"D'acord\\" (in Catalan) / \\"Vale\\" (in Spanish) directed by Alejandro Amenabar and starring Dakota Johnson, Natalia Tena, and Quim Gutierrez. Vidal wrote the song \\"Our Place\\" for the short film.({cite webtitle=Our Place de Maïa Vidal, Estrella Damm 2015url=http://www.elmundo.es/happy- fm/2015/06/22/55883a08ca4741571a8b4594.htmlaccessdate=July 21, 2015newspaper=El Mundodate=6/22/2015}) In the summer of 2018, Estrella Damm did another short directed by Dani de la Torre, and Vidal had a cameo appearance playing \\"Our Place\\" outside of a guitar shop.

Red Cloud Agency  The United States established Fort Robinson nearby in 1874 to protect the agency, established to serve the Oglala Lakota Sioux. The agency was named after the chief Red Cloud.  Spotted Tail Agency  When the agency was established in 1873, the Brulé Sioux moved to this location overlooking Beaver Creek, near present-day Hay Springs. The agency built storehouses, an issue building, a carpentry shop, a sawmill, stables, and other structures to serve the Sioux community. Camp Sheridan was established in 1874 to guard the agency, with permanent facilities built in 1875, including over thirty frame and brick structures.The Journal of American Indian Family Research. Vol. I, No. 4. Larry S. Watson, Editor. p 13-16. Following removal of the Brulé to the Rosebud Agency (later the Rosebud Indian Reservation) in South Dakota, activity declined and the US abandoned Camp Sheridan in 1880.NRHS sites in Richardson County, Nebraska State Historical Society.  Missouri River Indian Agency  Located at Fontenelle's Post, a former fur trading post, the Missouri River Indian Agency was also called the Upper Missouri Agency, the Bellevue Agency, and the Council Bluffs Agency. The Upper Missouri Agency, established in 1819, had responsibility for all the Indians living in a very large area of the Northern Plains of the United States along the Missouri River. The exact boundaries of its jurisdiction were not defined.The Journal of American Indian Family Research. Vol. I, No. 4. Larry S. Watson, Editor. p 13-16. It was re- established in 1837 for the Otoe, Missouria, Omaha, and Pawnee, who were some of the Native American peoples previously assigned to the Upper Missouri Agency. Between 1849 and 1851, the Council Bluffs Agency was reduced to a subagency and was discontinued in 1856, after the Omaha ceded their lands by treaty and moved on to their reservation in northeast Nebraska. Its agents were John Dougherty, serving from April 13, 1837-1839; Joseph V. Hamilton, serving from June 27, 1839-1841; Daniel Miller, from October 22, 1841; Jonathan Bean, from July 25, 1845-1846; John Miller from July 22, 1846-1849; John E. Barrow, a subagent, from April 13, 1849-1851; John E. Barrow from June 30, 1851-1853; James M. Gatewood from April 18, 1853-1854; and George Hepner May 19, 1854. James Gatewood worked with a council of 60 Omaha chiefs in early 1854 to draft a treaty for their cession of most of their land in the area. The national office of the BIA did not like his version and forced many changes when a smaller Omaha delegation of seven chiefs, chosen by their people, and an interpreter, went to Washington DC for signing of the treaty in 1854.Judith A.

Otoe Agency  Founded in 1856, in the Blue River Valley in southern Nebraska, this agency was responsible for the Oto, Missouria, and Pawnee of the region.The Journal of American Indian Family Research. Vol. I, No. 4. Larry S. Watson, Editor. p 13-16. In 1859, the Pawnee received their own agent. The Otoe and Missouria moved to the Kansas-Nebraska border. In 1881, the Otoe Agency moved to Red Rock in Indian Territory, when the US removed the Otoe-Missouria to that area for settlement on a reservation. Its agents included Jesse W. Griest, serving from April 1, 1873; Robert S. Gardner from June 16, 1880; and Lewellyn E. Woodin from July 21, 1880.  Santee Agency  Moved from Michigan Territory in 1866, this agency was located on the Niobrara Reservation in what became northeast Nebraska. It was responsible for the Santee Sioux, also formerly known as Eastern Dakota.  Winnebago and Omaha Agency/Agencies  This consolidated agency operated at varying points with varying responsibilities from 1876 to 1933. Located in Macy and Winnebago, the Winnebago agency originally moved to the state in 1865.The Journal of American Indian Family Research. Vol. I, No. 4. Larry S. Watson, Editor. p 13-16. The Omaha agency had been located there since 1854.  Pawnee Agency  Located at Genoa, this agency was located on the Pawnee Reservation and included the Genoa Indian Industrial School. The Pawnee Agency was established in 1859 for the Pawnee. They had previously been assigned to the Otoe Agency since 1856, and to Council Bluffs Agency prior to that. It was located at Genoa, Nebraska until 1875, when it was moved to the new Pawnee Reservation in Oklahoma Territory after the US accomplished Pawnee removal from Nebraska.  Ponca Agency  This agency served the Ponca from 1859 to 1877 at the Ponca Reservation. It moved with the majority of Ponca to the Oklahoma Territory in 1877, who were removed despite their wish to stay in Nebraska and have land assigned with the Omaha, to whom they were closely related and intermarried. Great Nemaha Agency \\"The Great Nemaha Agency became a full agency in 1851, and the Kickapoo formerly assigned to the Fort Leavenworth Agency were moved to Great Nemaha. A separate Kickapoo Agency was established in 1855 for the Kickapoo Indians and some Pottawatomi who lived with the Kickapoo. Between 1854 and 1861, the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska and the Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska gave up lands except small reserves on the Kansas-Nebraska border.

He was a popular preacher who re-established the Order of Friars Minor in Canada. He has been beatified by the Catholic Church. Early life Janssoone was born in the town of Ghyvelde, in the French Department of Nord, the country's most northwestern corner, on 19 November 1838. It is a part of French Flanders where the local language is a dialect of Flemish. He was the eighth and youngest of the thirteen children of Pierre-Antoine Janssoone and Marie- Isabelle Bollengier, and was christened Frédéric-Cornil. He was born into a prosperous farming family who prized culture, education and their faith. Janssone was just nine years old in January 1848 when his father died. Four years later, in response, to a religious calling, the young Frédéric enrolled in a college and then graduated to the Institut Notre-Dame des Dunes in nearby Dunkirk to prepare for the priesthood. In 1855, however, the family fell on hard times, so the boy left school to help support his mother and siblings. He went to work for some textile merchants, for whom he became a traveling salesman. He soon realized that he had a talent for selling. He liked meeting new people and he knew how to explain his products. His mother died in 1861, at which point Janssoone decided to resume his studies. After their completion, on 24 June 1864, he entered the novitiate of the Friars Minor, where he added the patronage of St. Yves to his name, making his profession the following year. He was ordained in Bourges on 17 August 1870. His ordination was done earlier than in the normal scheme, due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War at the time. Military chaplains were in great need, and he was quickly assigned to serve at a military hospital. After the war Jannsoone helped to establish a friary in Bordeaux, where he was appointed as guardian in 1873. Since he found the role unbearable, he was relieved of this responsibility a year later. His release gave him the freedom to take a course in homiletics, at which he would excel all his life. The Holy Land Vicar of the Custody In 1876 Janssoone applied to serve in the Order's international Custody of the Holy Land, which has been responsible for the Christian sites there and the pilgrims who visited them since the days of their founder, St. Francis of Assisi. His superiors accepted his request. He was initially assigned to serve as chaplain for a school in Cairo, Egypt, run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Two years later he was sent to Jerusalem to serve as Vicar of the Custody, immediately under the Custos. This position was primarily one of handling the administrative duties of the Custody, most especially the maintenance of the Christian shrines scattered throughout Palestine. Additionally, to provide a center for their work, Janssoone ordered the building of a new parish church, St. Catherine of Bethlehem, adjacent to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. To accomplish the demands of his duties, Janssoone had to sort through dozens of documents and manuscripts detailing the rules of procedure for the sharing of these sites with Christians of other Churches which had been worked out over the centuries of rule of the Holy Land under the Ottoman Empire. He compiled a guide to help the friars in their relations with the other Churches, which remains of use to the Custody today. He served in that post for ten years. In addition to his many administrative duties during that period, Janssoone also served as a guide for the many Christian pilgrims who visited the Holy Lands from around the world. His knowledge and skill in presentation made him a popular guide. It was in this way that he met a priest from Canada, the Abbé Léon Provancher, pastor of Cap-Rouge in Quebec, who invited him to come to Canada. Janssoone accepted the offer in order to make a fundraising tour to help the various construction projects of the Custody. A mission to Canada Janssoone arrived in Lévis, Quebec, on 24 August 1881. He immediately began to preach and give talks around the region. Shortly after the start of his visit, however, he stumbled slightly, through giving a talk on liberalism, unaware that this topic was causing a major division between the politicians and the ultramontane Catholic clergy of the province. Otherwise, his many sermons were greeted enthusiastically by the people. He preached throughout Quebec to large crowds. He was even invited to French- speaking parishes in New England. Nevertheless, to quiet continuing complaints resulting from the infamous speech by the foreign visitor, that following March, the Archbishop of Quebec, Elzéar-Alexandre Taschereau, ordered Janssoone to leave the Archdiocese. Taschereau tempered his action, though, with a command that collections for the Custody of the Holy Land were to be taken up in all churches of the ecclesiastical province on every Good Friday. This practice later spread throughout the Catholic Church. Janssoone returned to Palestine in May 1882, exhausted and sick. He resumed his administrative duties and stayed there another six years. He would later write Provancher that, after reflection, were he ever to return to Canada, he would completely avoid the political aspect which had caused such an uproar and focus on the program established by St. Francis, one of preaching charity, penance and peace, focusing on bringing people back to God. He was to have a chance to carry this out this intention. A new home in Canada The impact of Janssoone's tour upon the Catholics of Quebec was enormous. They saw him as reviving a tradition of the Franciscan missions to that nation which had started at the foundation of New France and had ended with the death of the last Recollect friar (a reform branch of the Order) there in 1813. This was due to the fact that, after its conquest by Great Britain in 1759, further candidates to the Order had been forbidden.The Quebec History Encyclopedia \\"Franciscan Fathers in Canada\\" Repeated requests to the authorities of the Minorite Order finally resulted in his assignment to serve the Custody in Canada on a permanent basis. Janssoone arrived back in Canada at the end of June 1888 on a permanent basis, and by August had begun to build a residence, called St. Joseph Friary, at Trois-Rivières, which was the first community of Friars Minor in Canada in a generation. The friary was considered a Commissariat of the Franciscan Order, a small center of recruitment and fundraising. A new and more permanent structure was built in 1903. Shortly after his arrival, Janssoone was drawn into the promotion of the local Marian shrine of Notre-Dame-du-Cap by Louis-François Richer Laflèche, the Bishop of Trois-Rivières, who wanted revive the sanctuary built there by the pastor of that town. He agreed to this reluctantly. He then set about touring the entire province to promote visits to the shrine. Janssoone would organize travel by train and boat for the many people he started to draw to the site. He would preach there himself and dedicated the people to Our Lady of the Rosary, its patron saint. Amazing miracles started to occur, which draw ever larger crowds. By the time the work was given to the Oblate Fathers in 1902, visits to the shrine numbered about 30,000-40,000 per year. While occupied with this, at the request of his superiors Janssoone also started to undertake massive fundraising drives which required travel throughout the province, a task he performed for fifteen years. He would preach in churches and go house-to-house for this, braving the harshness of the Canadian winter and farm dogs, selling some of the many books he wrote at night instead of sleeping. He had only one coat and would frequently sleep on the ground during these trips. Additionally, he also organized pilgrimages to the other great shrine of Quebec, the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré. In further service to the Franciscan movement, from his first arrival in Canada Janssoone worked to revive the Third Order of St. Francis, which had been established by the Recollect friars in 1681 for the spiritual growth of the laity, but had dwindled since the incorporation of the colony into Great Britain. He acted as spiritual director to the surviving fraternities scattered around the Province of Quebec. In addition, he was also working within his own Order to plan for its re-establishment in Canada. This was accomplished in 1890 by the establishment of a friary in Montreal. This led to the foundation of the Province of St. Joseph in Canada, which has been closely tied with the mission in the Holy Land since its foundation, due to Janssoone's role in its foundation.The Franciscans of Eastern Canada Death and veneration Janssoone took to his bed in June 1916 physically worn out by his many exertions in his ministries and in great pain. He was admitted to the Franciscan Infirmary in Montreal, where he was diagnosed as suffering from stomach cancer. After almost two months of intense pain, he died there on the following 4 August. His body was returned to Trois-Rivières, where he was buried in the small chapel he had built attached to the friary. The cause for his canonization was begun in 1927. Inquiries into his life were made in Canada, France and Egypt, and his many writings were examined. On 25 October 1988, Janssoone was beatified in Vatican City by Pope John Paul II. His tomb is in the Chapel of St. Anthony in Trois-Rivières and has become a place of pilgrimage.Blog of Archbishop Terrance Prendergast, S.J. \\"The Journey of a Bishop\\" 2 September, 2009 Retrieved 22 January 2012.

Singer’s immigrant parents used their savings to help hundreds of Jews escape persecution before and during the Second World War, and in doing so, instilled in their son an entrepreneurial and philanthropic spirit. The Singers required each person they brought over to bring somebody else, ready to work. Perhaps 1,600 Canadians now count themselves descended from Bella’s \\"pyramid scheme.\\" In 1944, Singer married Shirley Cohen. At the urging of a close friend who was smitten with Cohen, Singer reluctantly agreed to date her, fully intending to hand off Cohen to his buddy. However, upon their first meeting, Singer fell madly in love and, instead of a matchmaker, he became a groom. It would not be long before the Singers were a fashionable power couple in Calgary social circles and, until her death in 2001, their impact upon the city’s culture was most significant. Singer always held a special fondness for the entertainment business. Over the years, as he spent more time in Southern California, he became friends with many Hollywood luminaries, including Peter Lorre, Truman Capote, and George Burns. Business Interests  By the age of 11, Singer was helping his mother with the books while collecting rents from the family owned rooming houses. At the age of 17, Singer turned to business, and found a partner in Abraham (Avrum) Belzberg. Singer approached Belzberg with a business proposition, suggesting that they could buy the Foothills Building in Calgary for $60,000. That successful deal inspired them to form a partnership, United Management, a real estate business venture that continued for four decades thereafter and, at one point, held 200 pieces of property. During the ‘50s and ‘60s, Singer and his older brother, Hymie, introduced Alberta to the strip mall. They would land anchor tenants such as banks and grocery stores, which would help them get financing and snap up land. They would go on to develop other commercial sites around Calgary and they built several Calgary landmarks such as the Southland Commercial Centre and Alberta Place. Ultimately, they expanded their real estate empire through Western Canada and into California, Arizona and Texas. Singer also formed the Atlas Finance and Realty Corporation. Most famously known for providing loans to finance \\"One from the Heart,\\" by Francis Ford Coppola, the company also owned 50 percent of Cornwall Petroleum and Resources Ltd. with oil properties in the United States and New Zealand.  Hollywood Center Studios In 1981, Jack Singer was golfing in Palm Springs when he was asked if he was interested in touring Francis Coppola’s Zoetrope Studio, where the director of The Godfather films was shooting, \\"One From The Heart.\\" At that time, Coppola’s studio was located in Hollywood. Singer loved movies, so he tagged along looking for an autograph, not a deal. But he met the director, the pair hit it off, and soon Singer injected $3-million into the film. However, the film was an expensive box-office flop that pushed Coppola into receivership. In 1984, the Singer family bid $12.3-million at auction for the studio and, since they were the only bidders, they won, subsequently renaming it, the Hollywood Center Studios. Several lawsuits followed, along with the inevitable falling-out with Coppola, who, according to the Los Angeles Times, accused Singer of \\"using the loan as a wedge to take away his studio.\\" Coppola privately believed the Singer family was trying to ruin him; however, eventually, the matter was settled out of court. Over the years, the Singers pumped more than $20 million into various upgrades at the Hollywood Center Studios: the lot's control rooms, camera packages and infrastructure were upgraded to HDTV. This was done to support numerous television clients. Three cvc stages were added and a virtual set stage was also built to provide a cost-effective way to produce high-quality content for broadcast and the web. Additionally, production office space more than doubled, providing homes for dozens of independent companies, representing every niche in the industry. Finally, the studio installed a solar panel, the largest of its kind in Hollywood that provides renewable, environmentally-friendly power to the entire lot. As such, it was a source of tremendous pride when, in 2011, the Los Angeles City Council, via Councilman Tom LaBonge, issued a proclamation thanking Singer for his inspiration in leading the revitalization of the District of Hollywood and his dedication to the film industry. The LA City Council underscored one particular point: \\"Jack Singer came for an autograph and ended up saving the community.\\" In May, 2017, a Los Angeles based real estate company, Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., purchased Hollywood Center Studios from the Singer family for $200 million, then immediately renamed the property as the \\"Sunset Las Palmas Studios\\"  Sports Interests An all-round athlete as a teenager, Singer was a star pitcher on the Central Memorial High School baseball team, a quarterback, and a Canadian Golden Gloves boxer with 17 straight wins. As a teenager, Singer won the Canadian lightweight amateur boxing championship, and had his sights set upon a professional career. However, injuries in the form of two perforated eardrums ultimately convinced him otherwise. As a friend to athletes from all types of events, Singer raised money for WWII causes, bringing in top boxers for exhibition matches. Singer co-owned a thoroughbred racehorse named Tyhawk. In 1959, Tyhawk set a world record over six-and-a-half furlongs at one minute 14.4 seconds at Turf Paradise Race Course in Phoenix. In 1960, Tyhawk won the Highlander Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, matching a course record of 1 minute 10.2 seconds over six furlongs on dirt. Tyhawk was inducted later into the British Columbia Horse Racing Hall of Fame, and has been considered \\"possibly the top BC sprinter of all time.\\" In 1997, Singer launched an unsuccessful $70 million bid for the Toronto Blue Jays, a Major League Baseball team. Philanthropy Jack Singer Concert Hall Named after Jack Singer (thanks to a $1.5M contribution from his sons, Alan Singer and the late Stephen Singer), the concert hall opened its doors in 1985. The Jack Singer Concert Hall is located at the Arts Commons, a performing arts complex occupying 10 acres (4.5 hectares) in downtown Calgary. The Jack Singer Concert Hall is described as one of the most beautiful and acoustically acclaimed venues in North America. Artec consultants designed the adjustable acoustics system that includes a canopy, clad in laminated spruce wood. Suspended high above the stage and weighing 185,000-pounds (90-tons), this massive acoustical reflector can be raised or lowered to adjust the acoustical environment to meet the needs of the broad spectrum of music performed in the hall. Another prominent feature is the Carthy Organ. As one of Canada’s largest pipe organs, the Carthy Organ is hand-carved from solid oak and contains more than 1600 polished alloy and wood pipes. The acquisition of the organ was made possible through the Carthy Foundation, thanks to a $750,000 donation from the Mannix Family. With 2021 seats, the Jack Singer Concert Hall is home to the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, BD&P; World Music, and TD Jazz. The hall also welcomes a spectrum of events each season from TED (conference) talks and National Geographic speakers to wedding dinners on the stage and rock stars on tour.

It was a town of the Cossack Hetmanate and an administrative seat of Pavoloch Regiment (province). Jewish history It is estimated that Pavoloch was founded sometime in the Middle Ages, but it first appeared on Ruthenian chronicles in 1503. The majority of Pavoloch's inhabitants were Jews. The Jews in Pavoloch, as in many other shtetls, were victims of constant prejudice. When they got fed up with being harassed, the citizens build a wooden fort around their shtetl, which gave Pavoloch's inhabitants increased protection against invaders. It was a good thing that the people of Pavoloch built their fort, because their settlement was a constant pit-stop for advancing and retreating armies. Aside from the occasional prejudice, the Jews of Pavoloch lived in harmony with one another, with no fights breaking out among themselves. In 1736, a rebellious paramilitary group, the Haidamakas, carried out a massacre against the Jews of Pavoloch, killing 35 people. When they finished pillaging the shtetl, the killers hastily left. Ironically, only 3 decades afterwards, Pavoloch's population began to increase, with a total population of 1,041 in 1765. In 1910, Pavoloch's population swelled to 15,454 people. During the Russian Civil War of 1917-1923, most of the inhabitants of Pavoloch left, most likely in fear of the encroaching Bolshevik army. The brave, remaining Jews stayed in Pavoloch, throughout the war. The population continued to decline, up to World War II, during Operation Barbarossa, when a Nazi Einsatzgruppen (SS) squad drove into Pavoloch. The Nazis rounded up all the Jews, and killed them in what is known as the Pavoloch Massacre, making them dig their own graves before shooting them. To this day, there are no Jews in Pavoloch. Today, Pavoloch remains a historic community, visited by tourists, descendants of men and women who lived in the shtetl, and people who are interested in its history. Location Pavoloch is 100 km. southwest of Kiev, in the Zhytomyrska oblast. Geography Pavoloch's geography is fairly flat, with forested plains. It is on the Rostovista River, also known as the Dnieper Basin.

History  Designed in 1948 in the futuristic style by Los Angeles architect John Lautner, it was completed in 1949 for Neo-Fauvist artist Helen Taylor Sheats, who assisted in the design, and her second husband, dean of University of California Extension Paul Henry Sheats, who was also a professor at UCLA.

It had a magnitude of 6.3 on the surface wave magnitude scale and 6.2–6.5 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of only IV (Light) on the Mercalli intensity scale, due to its remoteness from any inhabited areas. The mainshock was preceded by a magnitude 5.1 foreshock ten hours earlier. It was the first earthquake in eastern North America known to be associated with ground rupture. Tectonic setting The northern part of Quebec lies mainly on the Minto block of the Superior craton. The earthquake occurred within the Utsalik domain, which consists mainly of Archean granitic and granodioritic rocks. A number of northerly trending brittle faults zones have been recognized in the domain. The area has been tectonically quiescent since the Archean. However, like most of the Canadian shield, it is currently experiencing post-glacial rebound. Earthquake The mainshock was preceded by a series of foreshocks, starting with a M 5.1 event about ten hours earlier. The hypocentral depth was very shallow, less than five kilometers. Modelling of seismic waveforms shows that the earthquake was caused by two sub-events, a thrust event followed almost immediately by a strike-slip event. The surface offsets show consistent thrust faulting over a distance of 8.5 km, with a maximum displacement of 1.8 m near the centre of the zone. The fault zone has a strike of N 038° E. There is no evidence of previous rupture along the fault zone. The NW-SE orientation of the maximum horizontal stress derived from the observed focal mechanism is at a high angle to the regional stress field for North America. It has been suggested that this compression is a result of the area being in a 'saddle zone' between two centres of post-glacial uplift.

He was born in New York State, and excelled at sports winning championships in boxing and swimming. He later attended New York University where he received a law degree. He had an interest in flying and during World War II Colonel Reiter served as a B-24 Liberator Consolidated B-24 Liberator pilot in the United States Army Air Forces, flying over North Africa and Italy. He was shot down over Foggia in Italy in 1943Ranfurly p. 241 and taken prisoner by the Germans. He was sent to an Italian prison hospital as he had dislocated both his thighs on landing. He later escaped from the hospital before his legs were properly mended when he learned he was being moved to Germany. He had managed to get fairly fit, but his thighs were still partly dislocated. He lived with the partisans (Garibaldi Brigade Romagna under Riccardo Fedel) in the Apennines for some months. He joined up with a group of British officers who had escaped from Castello di Vincigliata prison PG 12 camp during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. They included Brigadier ‘Rudolf’ Vaughan, Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe, Brigadier ‘Ted’ Todhunter, Captain Guy Ruggles-Brise and Lieutenant ‘Dan’ Ranfurly. In March 1944 with the help of Italian guides they walked 250 mile across the mountains to keep a rendezvous with agents on the coast. The travelling was difficult through snow, and the efforts of ‘Rudolph’ Vaughan with his game leg and Jack Reiter with his dislocated thighs became an inspiration to them all. The eventually reached the coast and after unexpected delays found a fishing boat laid up on the sands. Jack and Dan Ranfurly found a mast Ranfurly p. 243 whilst others secured a rudder and oars. In May they sailed the leaking boat about seventy miles along the coast just past the front line and were taken in tow by a passing Italian fishing boat into Ortona Harbour. After he returned to the United States, he put his experience to use by training military personnel in escape and survival techniques behind enemy lines. Colonel Reiter was later posted by the Air Force to Italy and as a senior briefing officer to General Curtis LeMay at Strategic Air Command headquarters. After leaving the Air Force in 1968, Reiter became a member of the Air Force Association and Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia. He was vice president for government affairs for World Airways and the Washington representative for Flying Tigers International and Japan Airlines. He served http://www.aeroclub.org as president of the Aero Club of Washington in 1976. He died at the age of 78 and was survived by his wife Helen N. Reiter and two children, Allan James Reiter and Kathleen N. Ausley.

The station lies on the Görlitz–Dresden railway, Dresden- Klotzsche–Königsbrück railway and Dresden-Klotzsche–Dresden Flughafen railway.  History  Platforms In the early decades since the opening of the Görlitz–Dresden railway by the Saxon-Silesian Railway Company () in the first part of 1845, trains ran past Klotzsche. In 1873, the Royal Saxon State Railways (which had taken over the company in 1851) was directed to build Klotzsche-Königswald station, so that the royal family's summer trips to the Dresden Heath (Dresdner Heide) could start by train to Klotzsche. The station was named after the locality that developed a little later into the villa estate of Königswald. From 1884, the narrow gauge railway to Königsbrück had its terminus on the station forecourt. For freight transport it used a forerunner of the modern container system, known as Umsetzkästen. A gantry crane in Klotzsche station allowed the transshipment of goods between standard and narrow gauge wagons. In particular, pottery from the Königsbrück area could be reloaded very carefully. After 13 years of operation, the line was converted to standard gauge and it connected with the existing Dresden–Görlitz railway to the north of the station. Until 1945, this connection was grade- separated. In 1907 the section from Dresden-Neustadt to Klotzsche was upgraded to three tracks. The current station building and track layout were built as part of the project. A branch line to Weißig-Bühlau, which was also projected at that time, only reached the planning stage. It would have run on a in a sharp curve immediately north of the station through the Prießnitz valley and produce a link at its destination with the Dürrröhrsdorf–Weißig railway. Since March 2001, the Dresden S-Bahn has run via Klotzsche station to Dresden Airport station. As part of the works required for the upgrade of S-Bahn services, the 170 metre-long island platform was rehabilitated and access for the disabled was created. A flying junction was built to the north of the station to allow grade-separated operations to the airport. The line from Dresden-Neustadt to Dresden Airport was electrified in 2002 and 2003. Only the tracks at Dresden-Klotzsche station that are necessary for the electrical operations to and from the airport are electrified, but the masts are prepared to allow the extension of the catenary on the main line. Work was carried out to August 2004 to improve access for various modes of transport at the station. Since then there have been a bus stop with disabled access, a commuter car park and 68 parking spaces for bicycle. In the spring of 2015, renovation work began on the heritage-listed station building, which until then had been left to decay. A local company that has bought the building and operates an organic supermarket with a bistro in it. The company has also rented part of the building to other operators. Train services The station is served by several suburban, local and regional services.,Timetables for Dresden-Klotzsche station which are operated by Deutsche Bahn, Städtebahn Sachsen and Vogtlandbahn.

Some authors however, consider populations on Santiago, Santa Cruz, and Santa Fe (and associated small islands) to be distinct species (M. jacobi, M. indefatigabilis and M. barringtonensis, respectively).Benavides,E; Baum, R.; Snell, H. M.; Snell, H. L.; and Sites, Jr., J.W. (2009). \\"Island Biogeography of Galápagos Lava Lizards (Tropiduridae: Microlophus): Species Diversity and Colonization of the Archipelago.\\" (.pdf) Evolution, 63 (6): 1606–1626. The species is commonly attributed to the genus Microlophus but has been historically placed in the genus Tropidurus. Description Male from Santiago Island showing dark throat blotch Adult Galápagos lava lizards range from around 50 to 100 mm long SVL (snout-to-vent length; excluding tail which can be equal or longer to SVL), with average and maximum sizes varying between islands. Males are on average larger than females, being twice to three times as heavy, with average body sizes of 77 to 91 mm SVL, compared to 63–71 mm of females. In addition to size, there are significant color and morphological differences between sexes, although color varies across islands. Males are blue gray to brownish, spotted black to ash gray, and tend to have dark crossbands on the neck and anterior portion of the back. The throat has a large black blotch, extending to the base of the forelimbs. Males have a crest of spined scales running down the length of the body, which are longer than those of females. Males also have proportionally longer hind legs. Females are largely unmarked or have light speckles, and lack the dark crossbars of males, although may have dark banding on tail, especially young females. Adult females lack the black throat blotch of males, and instead have a distinctive \\"cheek patch\\": a patch of salmon, orange, or brick red extending from the base of the front legs to the snout, and up to the eye. The cheek patch appears as females attain reproductive maturity. Reproduction Prior to mating, males seize the skin of the necks or backs of females in their jaws, and sometimes carry them short distances before mating. Females lay clutches of 1 to 6 white, leathery, elliptical eggs, with larger clutches generally occurring in larger females. On Santa Cruz Island, 2 eggs is most common. Females have been observed digging short burrows to lay eggs in May and June. Activity and aggression Galápagos lava lizards are active during the day, emerging around sunrise, withdrawing during the heat of midday, and resuming activity in the afternoon. At night they burrow under soil or leaf-litter, submerged up to 12 mm (1.5 inches), often returning to the same resting area each night. Male in threat display Males are territorial, with home ranges averaging around 22 meters in diameter, and defend their ranges against other males with threat displays and fighting. Females have smaller home ranges of around 13 meters diameter, and a single male's home range may overlap with the ranges of several females. Threat displays include holding the body erect, flattening the sides of the body, positioning the broad side of the body towards the opponent, and bobbing. Males tend to exhibit threat displays towards juveniles and smaller males but not to females, while females will exhibit threat displays towards other females and juveniles. Diet Galápagos lava lizards feed on insects, spiders, and other arthropods, with maggots (fly larvae), ants, and beetles being most common prey items. Around human settlements they will also consume bread crumbs, meat scraps and other litter. Fragments of leaves and flowers, as well as large seeds, have been found in the stomachs, and lizards have been observed in trees consuming freshly sprouted leaves as high as 2.1 m (7 ft) off the ground. Classification The Galápagos lava lizard was first described by Georg Baur in 1890, who named it Tropidurus albemarlensis after Albemarle, the alternate name of Isabela Island. In the same paper he described T. indefatgiabilis from Santa Cruz Island (alternately known as Indefatigable Island). In 1992 Darrel Frost transferred all species of Tropidurus west of the Andes Mountains into Microlophus (formerly regarded as a subgenus of Tropidurus), based on a number of characteristics, the unique defining trait (synapomorphy) being discs on the tips of the male reproductive organs (hemipenes). Some populations of Microlophus albemarlensis on different islands have been regarded as different species (or \\"candidate species\\") based on genetic differences, although no unique morphological differences are known. The recognition of M. jacobi, M. indefatigabilis and M. barringtonensis as distinct species is not widely accepted. The lava lizards are within the Tropiduridae, a family of South American lizards.

Initially made up of around 20 dissidents of the Société des Artistes-Décorateurs (SAD) and led by Robert Mallet-Stevens, the UAM offered a strong and militant alternative to the SAD. Motivated towards making a clean break from the past and struggling against objects in style, artists of the union proclaimed 'We must rise up against everything that looks rich, against whatever is well made, and against anything inherited from grandmother...impose will where habit is not invoked...overcome the habit of the eyes'. Young makers of jewellery joined the union with aims to create works of art in their field through the use of less expensive materials, making it more accessible than the current trend of expensive bijoux blancs. UAM members participated annually in the Salon d'Automne with an exhibit created by 'The Group', and emphasized design over decoration. Interiors were designed to function with concrete, steel and glass architecture and furniture made of metallic structures was arranged within, without additional decoration. Their message was amplified through various shows and manifesto's (its first in 1934 'For Modern Art as a Frame for Contemporary Life') and activity peaked at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris where Francis Jourdain's rationalist work was displayed in his interior design for A Workers Home; Marcel Gascoin's storage and organization capabilities were displayed in his library exhibit; Charlotte Perriand exhibited folding chairs with steel tubing; and Jean Prouvé introduced one of the first chairs constructed with the new material - Plexiglas.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Born in Clinton, Michigan, Marjorie Pieper saw action with seven different teams during her seven years in the league. She was used as an infield/outfield utility, playing mainly at shortstop, third base and right field, and eventually served as a spot starting pitcher. She also was a consistent hitter and showed good speed on the bases and in the field. Pieper moved around for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed to help teams stay afloat. Unfortunately, she never achieved a playoff berth to set an all-time record for the most years in the league without playing in the postseason.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book – W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. While growing in Clinton, Pieper played basketball, softball and tennis. She graduated in physical education at University of Michigan and also worked in a local bookstore. In addition, she was a member of two Michigan State softball champion teams in 1944 and 1945 before playing in the AAGPBL.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Pieper entered the league in 1946 with the Fort Wayne Daisies, playing for them one and a half year before joining the Kenosha Comets (1947–1948) and the Chicago Colleens (1948). She played exclusively at shortstop in Fort Wayne and Kenosha, hitting a .173 batting average in her rookie season. She notably improved in 1947, batting .225 in a career-high 109 games, while collecting 119 total bases and a .322 of slugging. She also tied for fourth in doubles (11) and belted five home runs, being surpassed only by Kenosha's teammate Audrey Wagner (7) and Rockford Peaches' Dorothy Kamenshek (6).All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book She opened 1948 in Kenosha, mainly as a back up for Fern Shollenberger at third base. Then found herself on the move again in the midseason, this time to the Chicago Colleens, where she backed up Marge Villa at shortstop. Pieper hit a combined .190 average in 107 games, while collecting a career-high 57 stolen bases. Pieper returned to Fort Wayne in 1949, but was sent to the Racine Belles at the end of the year. She finished with a low-career .163 in just 69 games, most of them playing at right field. She came back to Kenosha in 1950, for a short time, because was assigned to the Peoria Redwings (1950–1951) before joining the Battle Creek Belles (1951–1952). Pieper enjoyed a career year in 1952, when she posted career numbers in average (.253), runs scored (44), runs batted in (47), on-base percentage (.336) and slugging (.382), while leading Battle Creek in home runs (4) and RBI. She stayed with the franchise when it was renamed the Muskegon Belles in 1953, her last season. This time she played at center field, while collecting a .229 average with three homers and 38 RBI in 92 games. Following her baseball career, Pieper taught physical education at the high school and college levels. In her spare time, she was an avid golfer. In 1988, she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

It serves as a means of gathering inspirational data about people's lives, values and thoughts. The probes are small packages that can include any sort of artifact (like a map, postcard, camera or diary) along with evocative tasks, which are given to participants to allow them to record specific events, feelings or interactions. The aim is to elicit inspirational responses from people, in order to understand their culture, thoughts and values better, and thus stimulate designer's imaginations. Probes is one of the prominent approaches in the practice of co-designing. It is design-led approaches as described by the landscape of design research and practice. probes are usually used in the early front end of the design process.The probes were not designed to be analyzed, nor did we summarize what they revealed about the sites as an explicit stage in the process. Rather, the design proposals we produced reflected what we learned from the materials.Gaver, W, Dunne, A., & Pacenti, E,. Design: Cultural probes, Interactions, Vol 6, Issue 1, Jan/Feb 1999 Furthermore, probes were born to gather “fragmentary clues” about people’s “lives and thoughts” which means they are tools to inspire - others argue that they can be used to, provide relevant information and gather empathetic data.  Background  Cultural Probes was developed by Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti in 1999. They were inspired by the art movement Situationist International. This technique does not follow the scientific approach. It follows the artistic approach, which is characterized by being irrational, uncontrolled, getting inspiration, and cannot be analysed systematically. As Gaver pointed out , the conceptual concerns and specific techniques of various arts movements also influenced their probes design.  Applications  Cultural probes can be used for idea generation, inspiration, values and dreams in a design process. The technique is about opening up the design space, instead of narrowing it. Cultural probes aim to seek out subjective thoughts, values and dreams and surprise and uncertainty is a key value. The probes provoke inspirational responses by using a creative approach in questions instead of analytical and descriptive question usually asked in User Experience Research.Gaver, W. W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S., and Walker, B. 2004. Cultural probes and the value of uncertainty. interactions 11, 5 (Sep. 2004)Cultural Probe kit is a vehicle for self-reporting by asking participants to observe, reflect upon and report their experiences which can lead to have better and deeper observation in a context where, due to privacy as well as time constraints, it is not possible to conduct full participant observations. Since the initial publication in 1999 of cultural probes in interactions, the use of probes has been interpreted broadly and used in a wide variety of projects within user experience. Some cases are grounded very much in the original cultural probes work, while, in other cases, ‘probes’ has become an umbrella term covering everything from Diary Studies to longitudinal user studies to field trips.Boehner, K., Vertesi, J., Sengers, P., and Dourish, P. 2007. How HCI interprets the probes. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. CHI ‘07. In the traditional design process, designers usually engage in making after the design opportunity has already been identified. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the focus shift to more varied forms and formats of making in the front end of the process. Today making has become an activity that both designers and co-designers can engage in during all phases of the process. Cultural probe is one of these making approaches, which is used in the very earliest phase of the design process, the focus is on using making activities for making sense of the future.  Probes' family  Since Bill Gaver and his colleagues developed ‘Cultural Probes’, they have been adopted and adapted. Here are some probes which are derived from Cultural Probes; Informational Probes, Technology Probes, Mobile Probes, Empathy Probes, Domestic Probes, Urban Probes, Reflective Probes, Primitive Probes. Each kinds of Probes bring users to account to members differently: for example, probes that log everyday actions do this quite differently from those that require describing dreams. Each makes different forms of action and interaction visible and in different ways. Most forms of Probes involve investigative participation. Participants engage in reflective participation – both in the standard sociological sense of becoming aware of actions and interactions and describing them in some way, and in the methodological sense of making actions accountable. However, there is also evidence of different forms of participation. Cultural Probes emphasis imaginative and playful participation, engaging participants in activities that promote the use of aspects of their lives that are more “ludic’ and less goal-driven. Empathy Probes emphasis emotional participation, seeking out participants’ effective responses both to things in their everyday lives and new technologies. Both Technology Probes and Mobile Probes emphasis reactive participation and, to some extent, a change in participation or disruptive participation. Participants have to react to these new technologies placed in their lives and to the disruption to their existing routines that they enforce.  After Probing  Probing will add strong element of making to the research which is based on literature and practical work. It is difficult to create a precise pattern of the design process for probes. \\"The problem and the solution go hand in hand, and there is no single answer or method for analyses the probe materials. An inspiring idea about things such as the overall appearance of the probe, a single probe article or a visual detail can tune up the probe design along with a consistent approach to the problem. Although the methodological instructions can in principle be taken to the extreme, the outcome finally depends on the agents, i.e., researchers, designers and even users in the case of probes. Practical instructions are helpful, but somebody conducting research must personally be tuned-in to receive signals, interpret them and be surprised at them, as well as tolerate the ambiguous nature of the probing process (and design)\\".  Criticism  * It is hard to get scientifically valid information from data that is so subjective. * The data generated it not suitable for deep analysis and requirements list. * Participants are supposed to reflect upon and be inspired by the probes, but it can be hard to motivate participants doing it, as well as to get them to send the probes back. * There is a risk of few returns. * The wide variety of applications of and scientific approach to the probes has been criticized by Gaver and his colleagues as a misunderstood desire to rationalize and analyze the probes.

They have been working together since 2007. Independent of each other, they make drawings, animations, installations as well as backdrops and they also write texts. Their work often finds direct or indirect inspiration in children's literature, using and resituating their narratives and visual aesthetics. In 2018 they premiered their first feature fiction film, La Casa Lobo (The Wolf House). Biography Cristobal León was born to Víctor León and Eileen Dooner on November 22, 1980. He finished his bachelor's degree in design at the Universidad Católica de Chile, obtained a grant from the DAAD in 2007 and left for Berlin for a one-year programme at the UdK in 2009. In 2011 Leon became a participant artist at ‘The Ateliers’ in Amsterdam. He is also the brother of Alejandro León, architect and occasional artist. Joaquín Cociña was born to Loreto Varas and Carlos Cociña on March 18, 1980. He obtained his bachelor's degree in fine arts at the Universidad Católica de Chile. He participated in various exhibitions in Chile and abroad, and also worked as a writer, illustrator and a backdrop designer for the theatre. In many projects León and Cociña work together with the filmmaker Nilles Atallah (California, 1978), sharing roles in the production and post-production of their film- animations. They all three act as the directors, screenwriters, cartoonists, photographers and editors. By combining drawing, sculpture and stop-motion techniques they have created a corpus of art pieces that contribute with their own language to cinematic expression and thinking. Works Lucia 2007 Lucía (2007) and Luis (2008) are two experimental video-animations, which operate as a diptych in motion. They were produced taking photographs of a sequence of drawings made on the walls of a room and the transformations of the things in this place. The two videos are the two sides of a love story expressed in passing, inconclusive thoughts. The title of the 2-part series is “Lucía, Luis y el lobo” (”Lucía, Luis and the Wolf”). Der Kleinere Raum is a Stop-Motion video in which a young boy is trapped in a cardboard box. “In a room there is a box. In the box there is a forest. In the forest there is a lost child.” The film is clearly inspired on fairy tale aesthetics but has a claustrophobic and foreboding atmosphere. The film registers the apparition, deapparition and transformation of figures made out of newspaper and masking tape. It is made in collaboration with Nina Wehrle (illustrator). In 2010 Cociña and León made El Arca, El Templo and Padre. Madre. The three films combine the naivety and playfulness of papier-mâché, manufactured costumes and stop-motion with the reality of the human body with its low malleability. Heavy themes such as the ritual, sex and death effortlessly shade off into innocence, intimacy or banality. The videos pull the viewer along into a current of strong associative images, successive scenes from a mythic narrative that never really takes on its definitive shape. These recent works are considerably rawer, more intuitive and disquieting than previous work such as the fairy- tale like Lucía and Luis. In 2010 their work Luis was selected in the final top 25 shortlist of the YouTube Play Biennial of the Guggenheim Museum (New York). Also they have been awarded with the Asifa Austria Award for the films Luis and Lucía at the 7th edition of the Vienna Independent Shorts, the international short film festival. And their work was on show at the Kunst- Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin in the show ‘Highlights from the Cologne Kunstfilm Biennale.http://www.guggenheim.org/new- york/interact/participate/youtube-play/top-videos The short film El Arca is selected for the Tiger Awards Competition for Short Films 2012.

This organization seeks to accomplish this goal by raising awareness about fair trade and social and economic justice. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for producers in developing countries to earn a living wage.Bromage, Andy. \\"Burlington Vows to Play Fair...Trade.\\" Seven Days, 2009. http://search.proquest.com//docview/363157931 Such opportunities generally come in the form of direct market access and fair prices for their products. Fair Trade Towns USA aims to join consumers, activists, socially responsible businesses and retailers, faith-based groups, and local government in its promotion of fair trade communities. The organization awards the Fair Trade Town status to cities and towns that meet certain criteria. They provide guidelines for meeting these criteria and offer informational resources that are designed to help community leaders accumulate local support.  History  The history of fair trade in the United States began in the 1990s, when the use of fair trade labels was introduced to help visually distinguish products. Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO) was formed to set fair trade prices, and TransFair USA took the lead in the U.S. Its labeling efforts contributed to an average annual growth in the sale of fair trade coffee in the U.S. reaching 79% in 1999. Then, throughout the early 2000s, major chains in the U.S. such as Starbucks and Wal-Mart begin selling fair trade products. Fair trade sales in the U.S. averaged an annual growth of 50% throughout the decade.Glazer, Sara. \\"Fair Trade Labeling: Is it helping small farmers in developing countries?.\\" CQ Researcher, 2007. retrieved from EBSCOhost Database: http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2007051800 Following the proliferation of Fairtrade Towns in the UK, Media, Pennsylvania became the first fair trade town in the U.S. in 2006. Today there are 45 U.S. Fair Trade Towns in total. Below is a list of these towns as of November 2019. * Alexandria, VA (2014) * Amherst, MA (2007) * Ballston Spa, NY (2008) * Berkeley, CA (2010) * Bloomington, IN (2013) * Bluffton, OH (2009) * Boston, MA (2010) * Brattleboro, VT (2007) * Buena Vista, CO (2010) * Burlington, VT (2007) * Chapel Hill, NC (2012) * Chelsea, MI (2014) * Chicago, IL (2011) * Chico, CA (2009) * Claremont, CA (2012) * Cleveland Heights, OH (2015) * Conway, MA (2010) * Dayton, OH (2013) * Fond du Lac, WI (2013) * Greenwich, CT (2010) * Healdsburg, CA (2011) * Highland Park, NJ (2009) * Houston, TX (2017) * La Mesa, CA (2012) * Lawrence, KS (2015) * Madison, WI (2010) * Mankato, MN (2011) * Media, PA (2006) * Milwaukee, WI (2007) * Montclair, NJ (2008) * Norman, OK (2010) * Northampton, MA (2008) * Olympia, WA (2015) * Overland Park, KS (2015) * Pasadena, CA (2013) * Philadelphia, PA (2015) * Red Bank, NJ (2010) * San Francisco, CA (2008) * San Ramon, CA (2014) * Santa Rosa, CA (2015) * State College, PA (2015) * Taos, NM (2008) * Teaneck, NJ (2010) * Winter Park, FL (2012) There are also forty-three cities across the U.S. that currently have fair trade campaigns in progress.  Criteria  In order to be officially recognized by Fair Trade Towns USA, a town must submit an application and demonstrate that it has met the following criteria: *A diverse steering committee has been formed that represents different aspects of the community and helps make decisions for the town’s movement. *Retailers have been participating in the movement by offering fair trade products. *Support has been grown within the community and a diverse base of supporters has been demonstrated. *Media recognition has been gained in order to help raise community awareness. *The local government has passed a resolution to support fair trade.  Motivations  Although U.S. interest in fair trade has lagged behind that in the UK, the movement has continued to grow. Scholars of consumer behaviour have studied reasons for its growth in popularity. They suggest that Fair Trade Towns USA and other fair trade organizations have successfully capitalized on what is known as ethical consumption. Promotion of ethical products in recent years has transitioned from niche areas to mainstream markets. Business and consumers are attracted to idea of ethical production and consumption because it allows individuals to feel like they have made a difference with little pain or effort.Low, William and Davenport, Eilee. \\" To Boldly Go...Exploring Ethical Spaces to Re-politicise Ethical Consumption and Fair Trade.\\" Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 2007. retrieved from EBSCOhost Database: http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=68c15eed-65cd-4470-8799-9293752df664%40sessionmgr115&vid;=2&hid;=120 Fair Trade Towns USA seeks to motivates people to buy fair trade products by describing the benefits to producers and their families in developing countries. According to their website, money spent on fair trade products pays for children’s school fees, better nutrition, and health care. Being able to afford these basic things empowers those who would otherwise suffer in poverty. Fair Trade Towns USA also promotes ethical consumption by requiring that producers in these developing countries employ an environmental awareness in the production of their goods.  Challenges  Although the number of fair trade towns is increasing, the task of becoming one is not without its challenges. Much of the enthusiasm within communities to become a fair trade town is stimulated by grassroots efforts. However, most towns depend on free publicity to raise awareness. The criteria are largely met through the work of volunteers and fundraisers, especially in the initial stages. Fair Trade Towns USA offers resources on their website designed to help communities in their efforts. A few of these resources include sample campaign petition forms, community outreach letters, and press release examples. Fair trade towns are also encouraged to form partnerships with other networks within their communities such as religious organizations and environmental groups. Other cities have also experienced lack of support for fair trade as a challenge. For example, before it was certified in late 2011, Mankato, MN found that it was more difficult than they expected to convince their City Council to pass a fair trade resolution. One city leader there said \\"In the political environment, there are those who say this is not the council's business.\\".Murray, Robb. \\"Fair trade initiative nearing its goal.\\" The Free Press, 2011. retrieved from LexisNexis Database: http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/  References   External links  * Fair Trade Towns USA website * Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO) website Category:Civic and political organizations of the United States Category:Fair trade organizations ","title":"Fair Trade Towns USA"},{"id":"33945522","text":"Thomas Henry Morgan (1857 – December 22, 1940) was an architect in the U.S. state of Georgia.

It is a similar concept to Merit Pay for public teachers and it follows basic models from Performance- related Pay in the private sector. According to recent studies, however, there are key differences in how pay-for-performance models influence federal employees in public service roles.Perry, James, Annie Hondeghem, and Lois Recascino Wise. “Revisiting the Motivational Based of Public Service: Twenty Years of Research and an Agenda for the Future.” Public Administration Review, 2010: pg. 681-690 James Perry is one scholar who has conducted such studies. His research reveals that public servants tend to be more intrinsically motivated, and thus, are prone to have a negative reaction to monetary incentives. There is still debate, however, on what exactly makes the public sector different. U.S. Capital Building in Washington, D.C. History Pay- for-performance programs first began in the private sector. As consultants, academic experts, and employee advocate groups analyzed merit pay systems' success in private businesses, they recommended expanding this method into the public sector.Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.13 One vital omission in the process of implementation, however, is that the policy makers failed to consider that the stakeholders in the private sector differ from those in the public sector. The first trial run of a pay-for-performance system came in the late 1970s. In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter introduced the broad outlines of the Civil Service Reform Act in his State of the Union message. It was the first time a U.S. President had ever included civil service reform among his major legislative proposals. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created the Office of Personnel Management, to oversee the human resource management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, merit pay on a variety of levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers.Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 20-22 This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others would of necessity be receive less than in the previous system. The greatest benefits of the Act were that it clarified job expectations and defined goals and objectives. The clearest shortcoming was that it failed to establish a “demonstrable relationship between pay and performance.” Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.27 This failure had a number of causes—most notably a lack of adequate funding. Managers who performed satisfactorily often found themselves receiving less pay than their non-managerial counterparts because the non-managerial employees were still under the previous pay system. Some complained that this merit system seemed arbitrary and many employees did not perceive it as a fair assessment of performance and effort. Furthermore, the public became upset when they saw certain senior executives in the government receiving large paychecks. It became apparent that the Act was not an effective means of civic service reform. President Ronald Reagan When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1982, he significantly reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying the need for new legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that at least half of the board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 28-28 Although it was considered a significant improvement over its predecessor, PMRS only lasted from 1984 to 1991. The demise of PMRS was caused by poor discrimination among performance levels, inadequate performance findings, and little demonstrable evidence that the system improved performance. Over 50 percent of the employees felt like the size of the rewards was inadequate, and more than 75 percent of the managers stated that their performance evaluations provided little guidance for development purposes, mentioning that “insufficient funds [had] resulted in meaningless performance awards.”Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 30 Since the PMRS was abandoned, various proposals have surfaced and even a few agencies have tried variations of pay-for-performance systems. The Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security have both developed systems, but they were annulled when President Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act on October 28, 2009. There has yet to be a new pay-for-performance system implemented on a nationwide scale for the United States Federal Government. Research When these federal pay for performance systems failed, many were surprised because it had worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed to the fact that most of the research on pay for performance had been done in the private rather than public sector.Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance- Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg.47 These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms. Unique Characteristics of the Public Sector A limited and restricted budget is one of the biggest factors that have prevented the public sector from successfully implementing a pay for performance program. As noted by Antoinette Weibel, the private sector simply has more money and will always be more fluid with cash than any public sector organization. Profit motive will always matter in the private sector because a business organization's function is to maximize profits.Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009 Since public organizations operate on tax revenue, they are expected to act responsibly for that stewardship of resources. Public institutions also operate in nonmarket conditions and are subject to unique rules and expectations. This makes budgeting for incentives very difficult because unlike private sector businesses, public organizations cannot arrange their incentives around the company profit. By their very nature of receiving funds instead of generating them, public organizations can never have the same freedom that private organizations have in providing incentives in the work force.Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance-Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg. 46 As important as the budget differences are to the issue of pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, Edward L. Deci and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals. Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an \\"interesting\\" activity to perform. Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards. Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.Deci, Edward L. “Effects of Externally Mediated Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 18:1, 1971: pg. 105-115. Eisenberger designed a study meant to refute Deci's claim. His results reported that “perceived competence partially mediated the positive relationship found between performance-contingent reward and intrinsic motivation.”Eisenberger, Robert W.; Pierce, David; and Cameron J., Judy: Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation, 1999: pg 678 In other words, the detrimental effects of providing tangible rewards, discussed in the Deci studies, occurred under highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions. Although a push for providing extrinsic motivation is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward the understanding of Deci and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector. Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations are more likely to be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically. They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment. Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 387-412 Weibel contributed further to Perry and Deci's findings when she and her team examined the benefits and costs of an extrinsically motivated system, and compared this system in the public and the private sectors. This clearly defined scope allowed the pay-for-performance policies in each sector to be evaluated individually. The authors’ hypothesis was that the public sector has specific characteristics (the same as those diagnosed by Deci and Perry) that would make pay for performance ineffective, calling the proposed adoption for such policies “naïve.” Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 397 Recent Developments Research has continued to support the notion that although incentive systems may be effective and efficient in one organizational context, they can be ineffective or even counterproductive in others. Daniel Pink has been another persuasive voice who has drawn on many of these studies to call for new methods of motivation in the workplace. Daniel H. Pink in London He cites an MIT study in which the research team repeatedly demonstrated that as long as the tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical, performance-related pay works to improve results. The moment a task required any cognitive skill, the incentives became detrimental to performance. Others, such as Weibel, have also urged caution in implementing the pay-for-performance models of old. In the federal government, this is especially important because intrinsically motivated public service agents are shown to have a “higher incentive to invest in expert knowledge than extrinsically motivated ones and therefore function as the ‘institutional memory’ of public service.”Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 390 To preserve that institutional memory and continue to attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay. Some have suggested an incentive plan that focuses on employees' internal motivation. Instead of cash bonuses or raises, employees may instead be given discretionary time to work on creative projects in which they have a personal interest, as has been implemented by companies such as Google and 3M. Another alternative to a strictly intrinsically based model may be a hybrid in which monetary rewards and intrinsic incentives are offered, giving the employees of both dispositions the motivation to increase performance. It is unclear what the next step of action will be for the federal government, but since the issue of pay for performance is so politically popular it is unlikely that the issue will go away any time soon. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) and Office of Budget and Management asked federal government agencies to maximize performance as well as reevaluate and restructure human capital. These agencies were also required to amend ineffective policies on performance management. The PMA recommended streamlining the system of compensating and rewarding federal employees. One way is move from the present General Schedule approach to a system that emphasizes performance-based wages. In the US and many countries of Western Europe, pay for performance plans are used collectively. In Hong Kong, the popularity of pay for performance is increasing gradually both in the public and private sectors.

She divided her playing time between third base and shortstop, and made three trips to the playoffs. Best known for her fielding abilities, Johnson was the top fielder at third base for three consecutive years, compiling a .928 fielding average in 1946, .942 in 1947 to set a single-season record, and .933 in 1948. Her .942 mark was still intact until 1952, when Ernestine Petras of the Battle Creek Belles recorded a .965 average.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book – W. C. Madden.

Charlie, also known as Hwunumetse', later received the Order of Canada. The 9-foot-tall cedar wood sculpture is best known for its exposed male genitals. Creation Named after a native Canadian, Chinguacousy Township was rapidly growing due to the Bramalea development, initiated in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A statue was commissioned for a new township hall, with Simon Charlie as artist. Charlie was a sculptor of the Cowichan Tribes of the Coast Salish peoples. The Indians of Canada pavilion at Expo 67 included a totem pole and \\"welcome figure\\" carved by Charlie and two Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) artists. For the 1971 centennial of British Columbia, Charlie and thirteen other carvers were commissioned to carve totems presented to each of the other nine provinces, two territories, and the federal government. Internationally collected and displayed, he had already been awarded the Canadian Centennial Medal. The figure depicted by the statue is that of a nearly-naked Aboriginal man, and the name of the sculpture refers to a Pacific Northwest coast tribe. He wears a wide-brimmed Kwakwaka'wakw hat, and a cape. The sculpture features outstretched arms and exposed male genitals. The statue is made of cedar wood, and 9-foot tall. Exhibition and reception The Township of Chinguacousy unveiled the sculpture on July 19, 1972, in front of roughly 100 spectators. It was originally intended to be placed at the doors of the Chinguacousy Township municipal offices. Reverend Edward Robinson of All People's Church, in attendance, described the sculpture as \\"disgusting\\". The Reverend insisted that the sculpture violated Christian principles, morality, and decency. According to The Globe and Mail: He left the event relatively promptly. The Globe and Mail ran an editorial commenting they were \\"striving (against the wicked odds that only Toronto can provide) to view the situation with proper seriousness. But Mr. Robinson has not been making it easy for us.\\" The paper suggested that Robinson's insights \\"doubtless would have stopped Michelangelo in his tracks and branded him as nothing more than a dirty chisler.\\" Reeve Robert Williams suggested ferns and flowers indigenous to British Columbia would be brought in, and planted around the statue. Williams insisted the flora would not obscure anatomy. Township Council voted to place the statue in a \\"suitable place\\" in the yet-to-be-opened municipal offices. The sculptor suggested that he was not even sure what a fig leaf looked like, an often suggested addition, and no coverage was requested during the commission. By late August, the statue had developed a crack in its back. According to a Canadian Press report, \\"One civic official said it was probably the weight of the moral controversy, rather than the weather, which broke Kwakiutl′s back.\\" On January 1, 1974, the Town of Brampton, some of the Township of Chinguacousy, a portion of Toronto Township, and most of Toronto Gore Township merged into the City of Brampton. Municipal offices for Brampton were moved to the Civic Centre, and the statue moved into the Chinguacousy branch of the Brampton Public Library, within the same building. Shirley Morriss was the curator of the facility, until 1991.; article indexed on PINET. Tom Drynan was named Executive Director of the Brampton Public Library system in July 1993.; article indexed on PINET. In August that year, Drynan decided to evict the sculpture, after three years at the entrance of the art gallery at the Brampton Library branch. In a letter to community services commissioner Donald M. Gordon, Drynan wrote: \\"I am sure that the statue has artistic merit and needs to be preserved. However, it is quite inappropriate in its present location within the newly renovated gallery. Its presence dominates any other exhibits which are placed in the area. I hope we can find a solution without having yet another tempest in a teapot.\\" A report was approved by Brampton City Council during a council meeting on August 16, 1993. The report suggested that in British Columbia, such sculptures are frequently displayed outdoors. As Chinguacousy Park bears an Aboriginal name, it was deemed appropriate for the sculpture to be used at the entrance of the nearby area. It was to be bolted to a 1.5-metre high (five-foot high) tree stump. At some point before May 2010, the sculpture was moved into the Chinguacousy Park greenhouse. Former mayor Peter Robertson questioned where the statue was located, during a 2011 meeting about the \\"Southwest Quadrant Renewal\\", an expansion of Brampton's City Hall. In 2015, Robertson made a submission to council about the statue, requesting that it be given a more prominent place in the community. He suggested that Reeve Bob Williams was told that similar statues would be rotated by the Kwakiutl people, forward facing to welcome visiting tribes, backward facing to discourage their arrival. He suggested that the forward-facing position would symbolize Brampton's welcoming of immigrants.http://www.brampton.ca/EN/City-Hall/meetings- agendas/Agenda%20Packages/20150902spcc_AGENDA.pdf References External links * \\"Indian wood carving\\" subject heading results, in the Peel Region Newspaper Index * * \\"Brampton years ago\\", Brampton Guardian newspaper index listing for 14 July 1982 article. * Pam Douglas, \\"Naked man Brampton's best kept secret\\", The Brampton Guardian, July 24, 2012.

It is found in various parts of the world living on rocky coasts and harbour walls just above high water mark. Description Ligia exotica can grow to in length, with the males being rather bigger than the females. The general colour is dark grey, sometimes with brown flecks, and the appendages are pale brown. The head has a pair of long antennae which exceed the length of the body, and two unstalked, bulging eyes. The body is flattened dorsally and has seven thoracic segments, each with a pair of legs, and six abdominal segments. The first five of these bear flat, membranous gills and the sixth bears a pair of long, forked uropods.Ligia exotica: Wharf roach Smithsonian Marine Station. Retrieved December 3, 2011.Biology of Isopods Retrieved December 3, 2011. Distribution and habitat Ligia exotica is believed to be native to the coasts of Western Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Other authorities suggest it originated in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The fact that Roux gave it the specific name \\"'\\" when he first described the species in 1828 from near Marseilles, may indicate that it was not previously known in that locality. It has spread to many other temperate and subtropical parts of the world including the Red Sea, the eastern seaboard of the United States and Hawaii. It is thought that the spread occurred unintentionally via shipping, either in ballast or between the planks of timber ships. Its natural habitat is rocks and cliffs in the splash zone just above high water mark where it lives in damp crevices. It is also found, sometimes in large numbers, on jetties and harbour walls. Biology Ligia exotica is both a grazer on microalgae and diatoms and a scavenger on plant remains and detritus. In the eastern United States, where it is considered to be invasive, it seems to be the dominant invertebrate in its habitat. The impact of this on competing organisms and its contribution to the diet of predators has not been properly evaluated, however the NEMESIS database suggests it is not likely to be of much significance.National Exotic Marine and Estuarine Species Information System Retrieved December 3, 2011. Individual Ligia exotica are either male or female. Fertilization is internal and eggs are laid in batches of about eighty in moist cracks and fissures. Females often carry their eggs around with them using specially adapted appendages. The larvae develop into juveniles which go through a number of moults before becoming adult. Ligia exotica has a passive water transportation system through open capillaries in its legs.

He was the son of Ernest Casimir (1607–1655) and his wife Anna Maria of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Hachenburg (1610–1656). His parents fled to Metz during the Thirty Years' War. Frederick was born in Metz and spent his early years there. After the end of the war, the family returned to a devastated country. Frederick inherited Nassau-Weilburg in 1655. As he was still a minor at the time, his uncle John acted as regent. When he married in 1663, he was declared an adult and took up government himself. In 1672, the Franco-Dutch war broke out. Nassau-Weilburg remained neutral, but suffered nevertheless from troops passing through. Frederick died in 1675 of a riding accident. Count John Louis acted as regent for Frederick's children, who were still minors.  Marriage and issue  Frederick married on 26 May 1663 with Christiane Elisabeth of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Homburg (1646–1678). She was the daughter of Count Ernest of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Homburg (1599–1649).

The Liupanshui–Baiguo railway or Shuibai railway (), is a single-track electrified railroad in western Guizhou province in Southwest China. The line runs from Baiguo in Pan County to Liupanshui municipality, and was built from 1998 to June 2002. The line cost the equivalent of US$392.6 million (at 2002 exchange rates) and was partially financed by a loan of US$140 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The rail line passes through impoverished areas in the mountains of western Guizhou and was built to promote regional economic development and poverty alleviation. Freight operations began in March 2004 and passenger followed in early 2005. In 2004, the 43-km Baiguo-Hongguo section of the Panxi railway was added to the Shuibai line, and the combined line is known as the Liupanshui–Hongguo railway or Shuihong railway. The Liupansui–Baiguo railway, including the Baiguo–Hongguo extension, is located entirely within Liupanshui Prefecture in western Guizhou. Liupanshui Prefecture encompasses Liupanshui municipality and Pan County to the south. Route The Liupanshui–Baiguo railway traverses rugged terrain in remote western Guizhou. Pictured is the deep Beipanjiang canyon near Liupanshui over which the Beipanjiang River Railway Bridge spans. The line traverses rugged terrain in the Wumeng Mountains of western Guizhou and has 50 tunnels and 102 bridges, which collectively account for 64% of the track length. The arch bridge across the deep canyon of the Beipan River and is the highest railway bridge in the world with its road bed 275 m above the Beipan River below. The remote location of Shuibai line required the building of 220.3 km of access roads to support the railway's construction. Operations The Shuibai railway is owned and operated by the Guizhou Shuihong railway Company, Ltd. (GSRC), a state owned joint venture between the Guizhou provincial government and the PRC Ministry of railways. In 2004, the GSRC acquired the 43 km section of the Panxi railway between Baiguo and Hongguo from the MOR to extend service south and draw traffic from the Nanning–Kunming railway. As of 2006, the GSRC operated freight service in coordination with the Chengdu Railway Bureau and passenger service in coordination with the Kunming Railway Bureau. History and impact In 1992, the Guizhou Provincial and Liupanshui Municipal Government jointly proposed the Shuibai Railway Project to the National Planning Committee, the institutional predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The project was intended create a means to transport coal from mines in western Pan County, boost local economic development and connect the Guiyang-Kunming and Panxi railways. In 1993, the NDRC recommended the project to the State Council. After the State Council gave approval, the project was assessed by the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation. In 1996, the Guizhou Provincial Government, Ministry of railways and Ministry of Coal formed a joint-venture company, the GSRC. The Ministry of Coal eventually withdrew from the venture, leaving the Guizhou government and railway Ministry with 51% / 49% sharehold in the venture. In 1997, the GSRC sought a development assistance loan from the ADB, which undertook a fact- finding mission. A loan of $140 million was approved in August 1998 and bidding began on the procurement of civil engineering services. Due to the challenging topography which required extensive tunneling and bridge-building, the cost of the railway per kilometer was twice that of a railway built on level ground. Construction began in 1998 and was completed six months ahead of schedule in May 2002, though safety testing continued until September 1, when trial operations began. In November 2002, the Ministry of railways announced the opening of freight transport on the line but commercial full-scale freight operations did not commence until March 1, 2004. Passenger operations began on February 1, 2005. The total cost of the project was estimated to be $381 million with $170 million in foreign exchange cost. The actual costs of the line was $392.6 million due to higher than anticipated costs of resettlement, project administration, civil works, signaling and electrification. Only $105 million of the ADB loan was actually disbursed as foreign currency costs were lower than expected due to competitive contracting bids. The local currency costs were shared between the GSRC ($138.6 million) and a state development bank ($72.3 million). In 2007, the ADB undertook an assessment study and determined the project had created a cost-effective mode of transport for mining and industrial outputs and passengers in the region. The report noted the incorporation of the 43-km Hongguo–Baiguo rail line into the operations of the GSRC significantly improved the commercial performance of the line. Delays in the development of coal mines along route had caused freight traffic and income levels to be below anticipated levels. The shortfall was compensated by diversion of additional traffic from congested neighboring railways. No loan covenants were waived or suspended and the GSRC as borrower were in compliance with most covenants, with the exception of the rates for freight and passenger fares which were inadequate to recover capital and operating costs. The lower fares were due in part to the GSRC's use of freight fares to subsidize passenger fares. Overall, the railway experienced significant growth in both freight and passenger traffic. The project was determined to be \\"relevant, effective, efficient and likely to be sustainable\\" and therefore \\"successful.\\" In the years after the project was completed, local government revenue increased by 94%, average income per worker rose by 95% and the proportion of the local population living below the poverty line fell by 55%.

At about in area, it is the second largest of the lakes in the Upemba Depression (Kamolondo Depression), an extensive marshy area partly within the Upemba National Park. Geography The Lualaba River enters the Upemba Depression about after leaving Lake Nzilo (Delcommune reservoir). The depression is a trough-like graben about long and wide, running from the southwest to the northeast. The trough is about above sea level at its southwest end, sloping steeply down to an elevation of , where it flattens out and is filled by lakes and marshes for a distance of in a belt that is wide on average. The river generally flows through the marshes between the lakes, to which it is connected by narrow channels. However, as it flows through lakes Lake Kabwe and Lake Kisale, these may be seen as expansions of the river bed. History In 1957 pottery and metal objects were excavated from an Iron Age cemetery discovered at Sanga on the northern shore of the lake. The site provides evidence for the origins of the Luba people of present-day Zambia and the DRC, thought to be one of the first groups to work with iron in Central Africa. By 800 CE they were living in permanent settlements by the lakes, marshes and rivers of the region. The soil is fertile, supporting productive farms for crops such as sorghum and millet, while fish and game provided sources of protein. The population grew and society became more complex. Grave goods include copper artifacts which must have been obtained by trading with people of the copper belt further to the south.

The site is managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust and is within the Isles of Scilly Heritage Coast and the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is the only site in Great Britain and Ireland for the small fern, least adder’s–tongue (Ophioglossum lusitanicum). As of 11 September 2009 the SSSI was considered to be in ″unconditional recovering″ condition because European gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus) are at unacceptable levels. History Forty–three Bronze Age cairns have been recorded, some of which have granite kerbstones and others are linked by hedge walls. A cairn usually indicates a burial site. On the west side of St Warna’s Cove is a stone–lined well that is reputed to be of great antiquity, and close to where the saint is supposed to have come ashore in a coracle after a journey from Ireland. The name Warna is unknown anywhere else as a Celtic saint, and may be the name of a Celtic water goddess. In the past pins were dropped into the well as an offering to encourage storms to drive ships ashore. Wrecks were a vital resource for coastal communities. Ceramic beads from the 17th-century wreck of a Venetian ship can be found on the beach at Beady Pool on Wingletang Bay. Geology The underlying rock is Hercynian granite covered by thin, skeletal and podzolic soils on the higher land where there are many weathered outcrops. At the southernmost tip is Horse Point which is almost separated from the rest of St Agnes by a narrow neck of blown sand between two bays; Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin. Along the coast to the west towards St Warna Cove are boulder beaches. Wildlife and ecology Wingletang Down is of maritime heath, dune grassland and scrub reaching a maximum height of above sea level and is considered by Plantlife to be an Important Plant Area. Due to exposure to salt–laden winds, wind-pruned or \\"waved\\" maritime heath has developed on the low nutrient, shallow soils on the higher land, whilst to the south on the deeper sandy soils close to sea–level dune grassland grows. At the southern promontory of Horse Point there is short maritime grass and a tumble of large granite boulders where shallow temporary brackish pools occur. Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima) is a rare plant in Scilly and grows here. Sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) dominate the dune grassland between Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin whilst flowering plants include common storksbill (Erodium cicutarium), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) which is unusual here as it usually grows in wet habitats. At Beady Pool, which is part of Wingletang Bay, sea kale (Crambe maritima) grows on the strandline along with yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and sea spurge (E paralias). There is a colony of Six–spot Burnet (Zygaena filipendulae) here and in the past Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) nested. The nationally scarce (but common on all the inhabited islands) early meadow grass (Poa infirma) grows in the short maritime grass west of Porth Askin. The wind pruned maritime heath, on the higher part of the site is dominated by western gorse (U gallii), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bell heather (Erica cinerea). This heath is unique because all three Ophioglossum species found in the British Isles have been recorded within this small area. The largest and easiest to find is adder’s–tongue (O. vulgatum) which is the commonest on the mainland but the rarest in Scilly and has not been seen in the Isles (on St Agnes) since 1990, or on Wingletang Down since 1938. The second which has been recorded on all the inhabited islands is small adders’s–tongue (O. azoricum), which is nationally scarce and found along the western coast of Britain and Ireland north to Orkney and Shetland; there is only one recent Cornish (unconfirmed) record from near Porthgwarra. The third is least adder’s–tongue which, in Britain, is known only from this small area of St Agnes, where it was discovered in March 1950 by John Raven who found a colony of about one hundred fronds covering an area of one square metre. Botanists have since found other colonies all within the area of the downs. The probable reason for its late discovery is because the fronds are found in the winter and turn yellow and disintegrate by early April which is before most botanists are in the area. Since the withdrawal of grazing by cattle and, due to Myxomatosis, the fall in the population of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), some of the colonies are in danger of being smothered by competitive vegetation such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), European gorse and bramble. Outside of the Isles of Scilly the nearest colony is in Guernsey where it was discovered in 1854.

Zain, Shumail and Shahnawaz are friends who live abroad. Shahnawaz loves Shumail but after her rejection he goes back to Pakistan where his parents force him to marry his childhood fiancée. However, Shahnawaz runs away before the wedding and in due course Shumail too confesses her love and they get married, and move abroad. Meanwhile, Shahnawaz's sister Bhaag Bhari is made to marry the Quran. And his brother killed by a rival family. Shahnawaz visits his father, who forces him into a second marriage for revenge against the killers of his brother. He agrees on the condition that he is permitted to take Bhag Bhari with him, but discovers too late that his father has plans that lead to the destruction of their lives. Shahnawaz marries the girl without even looking at her until the wedding night where he found out it is an 8-year-old girl. He asks his mother but she couldn't explain anything except asking him to go back to Shumail. But his father choked her sister to death to prevent Shahnawaz from taking her away and when Shahnawaz and his mother found out they were devastated. Shahnawaz took off with the girl and left for Karachi where he left her with a Sister Veronica, he knew and promised to take care of her expenses and studies. He returned to Shumail but when he got the news of her pregnancy he got worried that he, as his father's blood, would treat her daughter the same. So he made Shumail abort the child but regretted it later after Shumail was heartbroken on that. This incident along with all others in Pakistan made Shahnawaz cut off from everyone. 10 years passed and one day Shahnawaz asked Shumail to leave him and marry their friend Zain(Adnan Siddiqui), who is divorced, and be mother to his daughter. And subsequently told about the abortion he caused. Shumail did not divorced him but got angry and Shahnawaz returned to Pakistan. There he found out, his parents died, his sister has been regarded as a peer, and her grave is famous as a mazaar. After stopping those ceremonies on her sister's grave, he went to Karachi for the girl he married, Mariam(Syra Yousuf). After taking the sister's permission he took her in his home to Karachi where he started living and doing a job. Mariam was fascinated and had developed a respect for Shahnawaz as she knew he was his only relative from childhood, though she didn't know the relation. Her friend Asad(Azfar Rehman) wanted her to marry her, though she didn't love him that way. Her constant efforts made Shahnawaz happier and even smile that he had stopped long before. But Shumail who decided to divorce Shahnawaz got hold of his diary and got to know how he suffered all these years so she came back to him in Pakistan. On meeting Mariam she thought her as the child he adopted and also accepted her as her guardian. Mariam accepted Asad's marriage proposal but Shahnawaz rejected Asad knowing his family belongs to Zamindari. Mariam accepted his decision but Shumail got suspicious. Later she found his nikaahnama and told mariam about it, but Mariam was overjoyed and confessed she has romantic feelings for Shahnawaz since he saw him but now she knows why. Shahnawaz told Mariam he loves her just as a guardian nothing else, and he loves only Shumail. He told Shumail everything and with the help of Sister Veronica, they also made Mariam understand Shahnawaz's reasons and made her sign the divorce papers. Later Asad met Shahnawaz and made him realise not all families are stereotyped and his family has woman at successful places. Shahnawaz after this accepted his proposal and thus show ends on a happy note. Cast * Humayun Saeed as Shahnawaz. The eldest son of Chaudhary Rabnawaz.

The film was shot in Warsaw from 27 January to March 2011. The action takes place during one single Christmas Eve, when a few adults find the loves of their lives. The ensemble cast is composed of Polish actors. The film's poster and plot refer to the British romantic comedy of 2003 - Love Actually. Sequels was released in 2015 and in 2017. Plot The film Letters to Santa portrays lost characters who discover that what happened to them is love. On this special day of the year, five women and five men are finding out that there is no escape from love and Christmas. * Doris - She is around 30 years old. What counts for her is a loving family. She is not yet married and usually wakes up alone in the morning, but this fact has not turned her into a desperate lady hanging on the arm of every encountered guy. She still believes that there's her second half waiting for her somewhere in this big city and that true love can happen. * Mikołaj - a romantic who is known for seducing women mainly on air. In real life it all looks a bit different. His greatest asset is his specific sense of humor and a deep male voice, stimulating the imagination of listeners who absolutely love it. * Wladi - many men would like to have his pugnacity and light approach to life. His charm and magic air works for women as an aphrodisiac. He can surprise with an unusual proposition, and in restaurants always foots the bill. It's just that no woman yet has succeeded to ensnare him. Will he finally find someone who discovers the key to his heart? * Melchior vel Mel Gibson - testosterone ebullient amateur and admirer of feminine beauty. As hardly anyone works in Ars Amandi. This arrogant handsome Don Juan is able to seduce with a single glance. The question remains if his narcissistic tendencies allow him to create a lasting relationship? * Szczepan - a busy psychologist who like Dirty Harry rushes to the rescue of the whole world. One day something happens that will destroy his peace of mind and bring him to a boil. What can he do? The excitement reach its zenith. * Karina - Szczepan's wife, very energetic, believes that love is like air and should be at your fingertips. But what to do when her husband spends more time working than being absorbed with his beloved woman? Is it a romance without real love? * Małgorzata - perfect, cold as ice and steadfast as a rock, radio director. Conducts business and her husband, Wojciech, with the same commitment and enduring opposition. Can something be able to knock her out of balance? It seems that nothing really...

In addition, he knows his wines, and the oldest people do not remember that his wife said \\"no.\\" Boredom. But even though under the thumb, to his own surprise, he is able to go beyond the rigid framework of routine when something or someone will awake deep hidden longing and feelings. * Betty - wherever she appears, all eyes directed only at her.

At the time this was the third best opening by a Polish film in the last 20 years. In its first three weeks the film grossed $6,175,026, and was seen by over a million viewers. Maciej Dejczer has since produced two sequels to Letters To Santa. The shoot in Warsaw began on 25 February 2015 and finished in April. Branded as \\"the Polish Love Actually\\", Letters to Santa 2 continues the genre of romantic comedy with a Christmas theme.TVN Producing Sequel to Polish Box Office Hit The third film was released in 2017, and it became the most popular film of the year in Poland with 2.98 million admissions. Critical reviews The film was positively received by both critics and the general public. The film \\" Letters to St. Nicolas was hailed as \\"a romantic comedy with a genuine\\" (according to Rzeczpospolita), \\"funny, touching and unpretentious\\"(by Metro), \\"the best Polish production for decades\\" (by Wprost), which \\"restores faith in the fact that in our country good cinema entertainment is created (by TVP Info), where the jokes are \\"undeniably successful\\" (according to Gazeta Wyborcza). The film was also appreciated by Duncan Kenworthy, producer of Notting Hill and Love Actually, who said: Production Winter weather was not conducive to the production of Letters to Santa. Snowmakers were utilised for the production of artificial snow. Filming began in Kampinos forest snowstorms and streets of Warsaw. A major challenge for the production was shooting in the popular Arkadia mall. The film crew could only carry out filming at night, although the story takes place across a busy Christmas Eve. There was reportedly a festive atmosphere on set. Katarzyna Bujakiewicz, dressed as a snowflake, sang \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", Tomak Karolak and Roma Gąsiorowska in beautiful costumes entertained over 150 children and 300 adults extras who played Varsovians participating in last-minute Christmas shopping.

The site was located about midway between the towns of Cartersville, Georgia to the west, and Canton, Georgia to the east. It was on the south bank of the Etowah River, but is now submerged underneath Lake Allatoona, under roughly 80–90 feet of water.Sears 1958: 138 Excavation The site was dug in poor weather in November and December 1948, preceding the impending flood waters of the reservoir. The Department of Anthropology at the University of Georgia, under the direction of William H. Sears conducted the excavation, and Sears wrote a site report as part of the Bureau of American Ethnology's River Basin Survey project. According to Sears's survey, at the site's population peak, the area of occupation would have been a village of approximately eighty acres. The site was dominated by one large mound, approximately 220 feet in diameter and six feet tall which was only a few yards from the original riverbank. This mound, as was typical of middle 20th century reservoir archaeology, was the focus of the excavation. Sears's was desirous of finding more \\"Southeastern Cult\\" artifacts, of the type excavated at Etowah, in a tight archaeological context. His hopes were not realized, but the site did yield more information about the Southeast's ceramic sequence and the Etowah culture's ceremonial structures.Sears 1958: 138 There were also several middens nearby which were unearthed and excavated. Sears noted that the site was used by three distinct cultures at different times, but was dominated by the early Etowah culture. The other two cultures which were present at the site were the Wilbanks and Lamar cultures. It is the type-site for the Wilbanks cultural period. These culture groups were distinguished by differing ceramic styles. All three cultural occupations, however, fall within the \\"Late Mississippian\\" time period. Earth lodge controversy There is some controversy over the interpretation of the mound structure which dominated the site. Sears, in his initial report, stated that he believed the mound to be a collapsed earth lodge analogous to the type found at the Macon Plateau site. He supported this claim by describing his discovery of horizontal molds of poles ranging in diameter from 4 to 6 inches and rocks scattered about the floor of the site underneath a layer of clay. He concluded that these had been rafters supporting a sod or earthen roof. He then speculated as to the method of construction which had been used to make such an \\"earth lodge\\" discussing the use of much wider support beams, a ridge pole, further rafters, and finally presenting a pen & ink artist's rendering of how he believed the site would have appeared in cross section. Lewis Larson in his \\"The Case for Earth Lodges in the Southeast\\" disputes Sear's claims. Larson hypothesizes that the mound at the Wilbanks site was not an earth lodge, but simply some sort of ceremonial mound, and that Sears misinterpreted the excavation. The absence of large support beam, ridge poles, or a hearth in Sears's report indicated to Larson that the structure excavated was not an earth lodge. Larson also noted that the absence of platform or bench seating made of either timber or clay also indicated that there was most likely not an earth lodge present at the Wilbanks site. Finally, the overall rarity of earth lodges in the Southeast and the seemingly general insignificance of the site in the region also points, in Larson's opinion, to an error in the interpretation of the site as an earth lodge.

History FAUR was founded by Nicolae Malaxa in 1921 under the name MALAXA. Main activities were the repairing of rolling stock, manufacturing steam locomotives, diesel locomotives, car-engines and passenger coaches, diesel engines, brake equipment, and special alloy steels. By the end of the 1930s, the Malaxa factories were one of the biggest industrial group in Southeastern Europe, and the main provider of equipment for the Romanian Railways during the period. Nationalised in 1948, part of the company became known as 23 August Works. During Communist Romania it extended its range of manufacturing by approaching pilot projects to the most Romanian industries but also to other countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. In 1990, the company was renamed FAUR and privatized. Since 2004, FAUR is part of Bega Group.Brief History Steam locomotives Since 1920, the design and the construction of different types of railway engines began at the Domains Factories (nowadays UMC Reșița) in Reșița and Malaxa Factories in Bucharest. Due to the success of the construction of the railway engines in Reșița and Bucharest factories, Romania ceased importing railway locomotives starting with 1930. Between 1926 and 1960, a total number of 1,207 steam locomotives were built in Romania: 10 models for standard tracks and 3 models for the narrow gauge railways. From these, 797 steam locomotives were made in Reșița Factories and 410 at Malaxa Factories. In 1960 the production of steam locomotives was ceased, the Romanian industry focusing on fabrication of the diesel railway engines.

Males tend to be larger than females, with matured females having an average carapace length of 95–100 mm, compared to an average of 90–120 mm with their male counterparts. When males are compared to females, there are a few notable differences. Males have a much narrower carapace, a shorter plastron, a shorter plastral hind lobe, narrower plastral lobes, a shorter bridge, and a shorter interanal seam.Iverson, J. B. (1989).

(and doubled to £lm. in 1953) The wool business thrived during wartime, and major expansion was carried out on Adam Street, but expansion onto South Road (then known as Taylor's Road) was opposed by nearby residents, no doubt on account of the smell which accompanies wool processing.

After a short time following his trade of bootmaker, he tried farming at Cudlee Creek then in 1870 moved to Undalya (in some references \\"Mundalya\\"), where he made a start in the wool business by buying small lots from the farmers in the district, and scouring on the banks of the River Wakefield. He was noted for buying wool during slumps in trade; sometimes he was the only serious buyer at auctions. He retired in 1909, leaving the business to three of his sons. Apart from his business and his associations with the Hindmarsh Congregational Church, he took no prominent part in public affairs. His home was at \\"Stoneleigh\\", 29 John St, Hindmarsh.

For three decades, the stables were run by former Goose Village resident, iceman and calèche driver Leo Leonard, also known locally as Clawhammer Jack. Leonard, who was reported to be the last Irish Quebecer left in Griffintown, retired and moved to Nun's Island in 2011. The sale of his land around his Ottawa Street residence has cast the future of the stables in doubt. Montreal landscape architect Juliette Patterson has formed a foundation in an attempt to save the Horse Palace, which has also drawn support from the area's historic Irish community. Though the stables are considered to have cultural heritage value by the City of Montreal, they are not a protected heritage site by the Province of Quebec. Patterson and her foundation would like to preserve the Horse Palace as a working stable for caleche horses serving nearby Old Montreal as well as a museum of 19th-century Montreal history. But the foundation has been unable as of December 2011 to raise enough money to purchase Leonard's land and buildings, which are now valued at over $1 million. The horse palace site includes the stables, a vacant 3,500-square foot lot, the Leonards' brick triplex and an aging former auberge, and is being sold in three separate lots. Efforts are being made to preserve the historical Griffintown Horse Palace.

It is roughly 9/16 inch (1.4 cm), and has about 15 ribs fanning out from the hinge. Distribution Rhynchonelloidella alemanica is known from the later Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) of France, Germany and Switzerland. The specimen that the description is based upon was collected in Lorraine, France (lectotype).Haas, A., and C. Petri , 1882. Brachiopodes der Juraformation von Elsass-Lothrigen. Abhandlungen zur Geologischen Spezialkarte von Elsass-Lothringen, 2(2): 161-320, 18 plates. Habitat During the Middle Jurassic, the fossil locations cited were on continental shelves, probably in tropical, shallow coral seas, where this lampshell lived as a stationary epifaunal suspension feeder.Paleobiology Data Base Description Rhynchonelloidella alemanica has small sized shells, subtrigonal to slightly subpentagonal in outline, with wide hinge line; inequivalve, almost plano-convex; dorsal valve markedly everted anteriorly, giving shell subcynocephalous to cynocephalus profile. Lateral commissures deflected ventrally at 15 to 30 degrees; anterior commissure highly uniplicate; linguiform extension high and narrow, top truncated. Beak short, pointed, substraight to suberect; foramen large, oval in shape, hypothyridid, with well developed rim; deltidial plates wide, disjunct to just conjunct; beak ridges angular, extending laterally; interareas well defined and slightly concave with fine growth lines. Ventral valve gently convex at posterior and flattened anteriorly; sulcus well developed, deep and narrow, with flat bottom, occurring at about posterior 1/3 of valve, abruptly separated from slopes and turning over towards dorsal valve sharply at frontal margin, resulting in high linguiform extension. Dorsal valve moderately convex at umbonal region, but less tumid than in Rhynchonelloidella smithi, norelliform stage feebly recognizable, sulcation short or even absent; fold eminent, narrow and well elevated over slopes with steep flanks, occurring at about posterior 1/3 to 1/2 of valve and making valve trilobate anteriorly. In some specimens, umbonal region more or less depressed, smooth area generally short or absent. Costae numerous, subangular, on each valve numbering 19-26, with 4-6 on fold and 3-5 in sinus; growth lines feeble, only visible at anterior margin. At gerontic stage, Shell thickened markedly along margins and frontal margin somewhat truncated, reminiscent of Goniorhynchia boueti (Davidson 1852). Interior. — Secondary thickenings in apical cavities of both valves. No pedicle collar observed in sectioned specimens; delthyrium wide, trapezoidal to rectangular in shape; lateral cavities narrow and short; dental plates thick and long, beyond hinge zone and divergent to ventral floor, or subparallel; teeth fairly strong, massive and mallet-like, held tightly in sockets; accessory denticulars and dental cavities present. Septalium variably developed, generally short and V-shaped; septum low and massive, only supporting septalium at very posterior part and most part of it existing as a median ridge, running about 1/3 or more of dorsal valve length; hinge plates relatively thick and broad, almost horizontal or slightly inclined ventrally at anterior parts; inner socket ridges well developed, but not strong; crural bases narrow, well formed and given off dorsally from inner margins of hinge plates; crura thick, about 1/4 to 1/3 dorsal valve length, calcarifer, incurved ventrally at anterior parts.Shi, Xiao-ying and Richard E.

It premiered on PBS on October 4, 1992, and the final episode aired on February 12, 1995. The series revolves around a close knit circle of friends from Brooklyn who solve neighborhood crimes and mysteries as a team of young detectives with the help of an invisible ghost. The ghost can communicate with the kids only by manipulating whatever text and letters he can find and using them to form words and sentences. The series was filmed on location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Series overview Episodes Season 1 (1992–93) Season 2 (1993–94) Special (1994) Season 3 (1994–95) Reboot In September 2019, it was reported that a Ghostwriter reboot would air on Apple TV+, premiering on November 1, 2019. The series was nominated for eight Daytime Emmy Awards.http://www.toughpigs.com/2020-emmy- noms/ Season 4 (2019) Home releases During the mid-1990s Ghostwriter was released on VHS by two different companies, GPN and Republic Pictures. GPN is the company authorized by PBS to release all its shows on video. They have the entire series except for the last two cases. These videos are in the original format with each case divided into four episodes (except case 1 and 5, where they're divided in five). Republic Pictures released only three cases (all from the first season) : \\"Ghost Story\\", \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\" and \\"Into the Comics\\". In Republic Pictures' version, the four or five episodes for each case were edited together into a feature-length movie. The Republic Pictures version is currently out of print, but can still be found in some libraries in the US and Canada only. The GPN version was available to the general public for purchase through their website until 2007. Starting mid-2007, GPN is selling only to schools and libraries due to a change in licensing terms. However, the GPN version is still available in some libraries. In February 2010, it was announced that season one of Ghostwriter would be released on DVD by Shout! Factory. The five-disc set, running 870 minutes long, was released on June 8, 2010, featuring a trivia game and a casebook as bonus materials.

It runs from the city of Kristiansand in the southern coast of Norway, through the Torridal and Setesdal valleys in Agder county to Haukeligrend in Vestfold og Telemark county in the north where it meets the European route E134 highway. The highway goes through the villages of Mosby, Homstean, Skarpengland, Hægeland, Hornesund, Hornnes, Evje, Byglandsfjord, Bygland, Ose, Rysstad, Valle, Flatland, Rygnestad, Bykle, Hovden, Bjåen, and Haukeli. The highway is long, with in Agder county, and in Vestfold og Telemark county. The highway connects to the European route E18 and European route E39 highways in the city of Kristiansand. At the other end of the highway, it connects to the European route E134 highway in Haukeli.  History  Historically, parts of the road had an alternate way of traveling before this road was constructed. Between Kristiansand, Grovane, and Byglandsfjord, there was the old Setesdalsbanen railway line. The steamboat SS Bjoren ran from Byglandsfjord to the village of Bygland on the lake Byglandsfjorden before the road was built. In Setesdal, people and animals used to trek across the mountains from Fyresdal and in the east, from Vinje in the north, from Suldal and Sirdal in the west in order to get to other areas. The so-called Bishops Road went from Fyresdal to Valle in Setesdal. A post road was built from the south into Setesdal in 1840. From 1867 to 1879 the post road was continued from Valle to Hovden. In 1936, the road reached Bjåen in the high mountains at the north end of Setesdal. After World War II, the road was built further north into Vinje in Telemark county. There were two critical points in the construction of this road that were very difficult to build. The first was at Fånekleivi on the east shore of the Byglandsfjorden, about south of the village of Bygland and the second one was at Byklestigen, just south of the village of Bykle. Both of these areas were difficult to pass using a horse and they could be dangerous in the winters. Today's road has corrected both of these difficult areas by building tunnels through the adjacent mountainsides. There is a long tunnel through the mountain Fånefjell in Bygland and a long tunnel at Byklestigen.

It is found in Arizona (United States) and Sonora (Mexico). It is considered a semi-aquatic turtle and is found in Desert of Arizona (United States) and Sonora (Mexico). It lives in impermanent puddle, and they avoid permanent rivers and lakes. The male adult Arizona mud turtle is 103.0- 181.3 mm (4-7.5 in) long, and female Arizona mud turtle is slightly smaller than the male. The turtle's top shell is brown and olive brown with a dome shaped appearance. The skin is brown, dark silver on top, and light yellow on bottom of the head. There are no specific pattern or stripes on extremities. The turtle's diet includes anurans, tadpoles, invertebrates and carrion. Arizona mud turtle is only active during the day. It is active at night during summer in search of food. During winter Arizona mud turtle will hibernates under the temporary puddle and pond. The growth cycle begins in July and early August when the turtle starts laying eggs. Except habitat loss, Arizona mud turtle often faces decrease in population due to agriculture activity. Fortunately, due to lack of water in the desert agriculture activity is minimized. Description The male adult Arizona mud turtle is 103.0- 181.3 mm (4-7.5 in) long, and female Arizona mud turtle is 95.5-167.3mm (3.5-6.5 on) long. The turtle's body varies in color. The carapace (upper portion of the shell) is dome shaped and tends to be brown, olive or a yellow- brown in color. The carapace also lacks keels. The marginal shields, which can be described as the rim around the shell is yellow. In addition, the lower portion of the shell, also known as the plastron, is yellow as well. The superior of the head is grey in color, and the inferior and the sides are cream and light yellow. One thing that separates them from other species of turtles is that the first vertebral scute and second marginal shield do not connect. Habitat and behavior Arizona mud turtles prefer temporary ponds and puddle because they will have a secured food source. The Arizona mud turtle's activity occurs during the day. It is often found near the temporary pond to conserve heat and energy from sunlight. It also is active at night but specifically in July and August in monsoon season. Because it is warm during this period, they tend to spend most of their time in the water, hence why they are known as semi aquatic. During the winter months, they hibernate in a burrow. When drought occurs, Arizona mud turtle can remain dormant underground for maximum of two years. Distribution Living in the lowland area, the Arizona mud turtle usually lives between the elevation of 200-800m. The Arizona mud turtle can be located in the Lower Colorado River Sonoran Desert scrub, Arizona Upland Sonoran Desert scrub, and Semidesert Grassland communities. Diet Their diet consists of anurans, dytiscid, toads, tadpoles, fish, invertebrates, hydrophilid and carrion. Life cycle The female Arizona mud turtle lays three to seven eggs and mates primarily in July till early August. Arizona mud turtle does not have a special nesting habits, and it usually hatch and bury its eggs close to the food sources. Hatchlings are usually 25–28 mm carapace length and have life span from 6 to 10 years age. Major threats The species is considered threatened, because there has been ranching, agriculture and flood control taking place in the Sonoran Desert. Establishing themselves in wetlands also exposes them to climate and habitat degradation. An adult Arizona mud turtle usually will survive these conditions, however. Road mortality is also likely to affect this species. On the positive side, the Arizona mud turtle adapts and benefits from pond reconstruction performed by humans.

In an effort to improve the neighborhood during a downward trend of arson, drugs, and abandonment common in that era, members of the Latino group Charas/El Bohio cleared out truckloads of refuse.http://laplazacultural.com/?page_id=15 Working with Buckminster Fuller, they built a geodesic dome in the open “plaza” and began staging cultural events. Green Guerillas pioneer Liz Christy seeded the turf with “seed bombs” and planted towering weeping willows and linden trees. Artist Gordon Matta- Clark helped construct La Plaza’s amphitheater using railroad ties and materials reclaimed from abandoned buildings. Later, block residents tilled the western portion of the space and planted vegetables, flowers and fruit trees. During the 1980s, the garden came under attack by developers seeking to build on the space. After numerous court battles, La Plaza was finally preserved in 2002 as part of the terms of a legal settlement.http://thevillager.com/vilager_26/laplazacultural.html In 2003, La Plaza was renamed in memory of Armando Perez, a CHARAS founder and former District Leader of the Lower East Side who was killed in 1999.https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/nyregion/2-charged-with-murder-of- east-village-advocate.html References Category:East Village, Manhattan ","title":"La Plaza Cultural de Armando Perez"},{"id":"33946581","text":"Duvefjorden is located at the northern side of Nordaustlandet.

The titular character of the series is an enigmatic figure. The mystery of Ghostwriter's true identity is never fully answered, although several clues are given during the course of the series in several of the cases (the following facts are from \\"Ghost Story\\", the pilot episode, unless otherwise stated): * He was a man when he was alive, but is now a ghost. * He wanted to protect \\"the children.\\" * He can only be seen by those to whom he reveals himself. * He can read and feel emotions. * He cannot hear. * He communicates by writing. * He cannot talk. * He was alive before: *#the Federal Bureau of Investigation was formed (1908). *#Walt Disney became famous (after 1920). *#Elvis Presley (born 1935). * He cannot see pictures. * He wrapped around the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument as if happy or familiar with it. * He requires team cohesion in order to \\"survive\\". (\\"Get the Message\\") * He can travel through time. (\\"Just in Time\\") * He can travel across the Internet. (\\"Who is Max Mouse?\\") * At one point, he remembers he was chased by dogs. (\\"A Crime of Two Cities\\") The producers' intent was to reveal Ghostwriter to be \\"a famous 15th- to 16th-century writer, but not Shakespeare\\" at the end of the first season, although this eventually never happened. D.J. MacHale, who wrote the pilot episode, stated: \\"If memory serves, Ghostwriter was supposed to be an ancestor of Jamal's, who was an escaped slave from the south who educated himself and learned the value of reading.\\" According to producer and writer Kermit Frazier, \\"“Ghostwriter was a runaway slave during the Civil War. He was killed by slave catchers and their dogs as he was teaching other runaway slaves how to read in the woods. His soul was kept in the book and released once Jamal discovered the book.” The Ghostwriter team The Ghostwriter Team When the show began, it was based around four main characters, all students at Zora Neale Hurston Middle School and Washington Elementary School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York. The \\"team\\" later expanded to include six (later seven) active members, one MIA member, one member in Australia, two members in England, and three members in 1928. To become a member of the team, a kid would have to be able to read the words that Ghostwriter manipulates. There was normally an induction ceremony for each new member that joined the team. At this ceremony, they would be given a special pen with a string to be placed around the neck so the members could write to Ghostwriter no matter where they happened to be and to note all of the clues in their investigations. When a team meeting was required, one of the members would use Ghostwriter to send out the message \\"rally\\", followed by the first initial of the member that was hosting the meeting (usually either Jamal, Alex, Lenni or Gaby). Alex, Jamal, and Lenni also came up with a special Ghostwriter handshake for the team. Members of the team also use a casebook. A casebook is a binder with papers for noting all the suspects, evidence against them, and clues in their investigations, allowing the team to review them. Alex later coins the review under the term \\"rewind,\\" which the team likes and it became their catch phrase. As Gaby said, \\"solving a case is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, and the casebook is where (they) keep all the pieces.\\" Basically, a casebook is an effective tool to \\"start piecin' the puzzle. Organizing stuff, getting it together.\\" Ghostwriter would also read whatever was written within the casebook, and then help the team to find more clues. There's also another casebook especially made for Ghostwriter to help him figure out who he was. Make a casebook to keep track of all the clues: *Make a page for each suspect. **SUSPECT: Who might have done the crime? **EVIDENCE: Where was the suspect and why would he or she do it? *Make a page for OTHER CLUES. **Write facts that may be important to help solve the case.Ghostwriter - \\"Just In Time\\" Jamal Jenkins Jamal (portrayed by Sheldon Turnipseed) is level-headed and intelligent; the first person Ghostwriter reveals himself to and the de facto leader of the Ghostwriter team. In the first episode of the series, \\"Ghost Story, Part 1\\", seventh grader Jamal is cleaning out the basement of his family's brownstone with his father, Reggie Jenkins (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson in the first three cases and Dean Irby afterwards) and his mother Doris Jenkins (portrayed by Elizabeth Van Dyke), when a spirit emerges from a book that has fallen on the ground and begins communicating with Jamal through words. Jamal lives with his parents and his grandmother (portrayed by Marcella Lowery); his older sister Danitra is away at college. Midway through the second season, Jamal's young cousin, Casey, also comes to stay with the family. Jamal's interests include karate and science; he dreams to one day be \\"a scientist that performs experiments in outer space.\\" Jamal applies for enrollment in the High School of Science in \\"Who is Max Mouse?\\", and in \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" he is accepted. Major cases for Jamal include: * \\"Ghost Story\\": Jamal discovers Ghostwriter. * \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\": Jamal is accused of burning a local video store, causing discord in the team following his covering up of the facts. * \\"Who's Who\\": In a subplot, Jamal's grandmother is sick. * \\"Get the Message\\": Works with Rob to get the team back together and prevent Ghostwriter from fading away after the discord within the team. * \\"Just in Time\\": Takes place in Jamal's home, circa 1928. Ghostwriter is also working hard in this case due to the \\"future\\" of Jamal's family and the team. * \\"Who is Max Mouse?\\": Jamal introduces the team to the Internet. Also, Jamal is a suspect for causing false fire alarms and changing grades at school. * \\"A Crime of Two Cities\\": Jamal travels to London and gets involved with a mystery that spans the Atlantic Ocean. Lenni Frazier Lenni (portrayed by Blaze Berdahl) is the second person to \\"see\\" Ghostwriter. A headstrong girl, Lenni is an aspiring singer, rapper, and songwriter. Lenni lives with her widowed father (portrayed by Richard Cox from the first season through the middle of the second season, and Keith Langsdale afterwards), in a loft above the Fernandezes' bodega. Lenni's father is a musician. Her mother died when Lenni was a young child. Midway through the series, Lenni's father begins to date a British woman named Sally. Though Lenni likes Sally very much (she was the one who introduced them), she has trouble coping with her father's new relationship. Lenni is an avid comic book fan, and she also loves cooking with her father and reading Harriet the Spy (also her late mother's favorite book during her childhood). Major cases for Lenni include: * \\"Ghost Story\\": Lenni discovers Ghostwriter and meets Jamal. * \\"Into the Comics\\": Gets the team involved in a scavenger hunt so they can win the grand prize, and become characters in a comic book. * \\"Get the Message\\": Lenni's father and Alex and Gaby's father bicker over a car accident, causing discord within the team. * \\"Who is Max Mouse?\\": With Jamal, Lenni becomes a suspect for causing false fire alarms and changing grades at school. * \\"Don't Stop the Music\\": Lenni and the team are given the chance by Smash Records to shoot a music video for Lenni's song \\"You Gotta Believe\\". * \\"Attack of the Slime Monster\\": When she applied for a job at Hurston's prom, she teams up with Tina's older brother and even has him as a date. Alex Fernández Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fernández (portrayed by (David López) is the third person to be introduced to Ghostwriter. A first generation Salvadorian American and a sixth grader, Alex is an aspiring detective and skilled basketball player. Alex and his younger sister Gaby live with their parents (father portrayed by Shawn Elliot; mother portrayed by Cordielia Gonzalaz from the first season through the middle of the second season and Iliana Guibert afterwards) in the back of the family store (or bodega), which is located under Lenni's apartment. Alex is prone to a hot temper at times, but also displays a notable amount of courage and determination. Alex has several penpals all over the world. Major cases for Alex include: * \\"Ghost Story\\": Alex discovers Ghostwriter and meets Jamal. * \\"To Catch a Creep\\": Alex runs for class president and encounters much opposition. * \\"Who's Who\\": Alex begins a romantic attachment with team member, Tina. * \\"Over a Barrel\\": Tina & Alex have their first kiss. * \\"Get the Message\\": Lenni's father and Alex & Gaby's father bicker over a car accident, causing discord within the team. * \\"What's Up With Alex?\\": Alex's basketball teammate Kevin offers him marijuana, however Alex struggles to get Kevin help instead from his substance abuses and to get him out of a robbery scheme at the cost of his relationships with his family and friends in the process. Gaby Fernández Gabriela \\"Gaby\\" Fernández (portrayed by Mayteana Morales in the first two seasons and in \\"A Crime of Two Cities\\"; and by Melissa Gonzales in \\"Four Days of the Cockatoo\\" and \\"Attack of the Slime Monster\\") is the fourth person to \\"see\\" Ghostwriter. She is Alex's younger sister, goes to Washington Elementary, and is best friends with her teammate Tina. She is 9 years old in \\"Am I Blue?\\". She is known for being quite talkative. However, she has a good sense of humor which usually manifests when she is teasing her brother, Alex. Of all the team members, Gaby is the one who appears closest to Ghostwriter on a personal level. Twice, she shows belated concern for Ghostwriter's safety (\\"Just in Time\\" and \\"Who is Max Mouse?\\"); she creates a word \\"bed\\" for him (\\"Who is Max Mouse?\\"), and she is shown playing a word game with Ghostwriter in \\"Lost in Brooklyn\\". She is an aspiring newscaster. Major cases for Gaby include: * \\"Ghost Story\\": Gaby discovers Ghostwriter and meets Jamal. * \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\": Makes a video with Tina while investigating the case to help Jamal prove his innocence. * \\"Over a Barrel\\": Gaby gets sick due to tetrachloroethylene (\\"perc\\") contamination in the community garden. * \\"Am I Blue?\\": Gaby steals money from the bodega's register to buy a \\"Galaxy Girl\\" costume. * \\"Get the Message\\": Lenni's father and Alex & Gaby's father bicker over a car accident, causing discord within the team. * \\"Four Days of the Cockatoo\\": Gaby finds a rare palm cockatoo, treasured by a pair of dirty crooks. Tina Nguyen Although Tina (portrayed by Tram-Anh Tran), a Vietnamese American girl is present in the first case of the series, she does not \\"see\\" Ghostwriter until the second case, \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\" Despite not being involved with the team on their first case, she investigates it herself for her school and is intrigued by Alex and Jamal's investigation methods after she meets and befriends them. She eventually joins the team after meeting Ghostwriter. She wants to be a filmmaker, and is often seen with a camcorder in her hand, which comes in handy during several cases. She attends acting and film classes, and lives with her parents, her brother Tony and Tuan, and sister Linda in a traditionalist Vietnamese household. Tina is the first person in her family to be born in the United States. Her parents own a tailor shop which she helps run. Her best friend is Gaby, and she has a romantic relationship with Gaby's brother Alex. Major cases for Tina include: * \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\": Tina first \\"sees\\" Ghostwriter. She makes a video with Gaby while investigating the case to help Jamal prove his innocence. * \\"Who's Who\\": Tina becomes a \\"girl Friday\\" for classic movie actress, Lana Barnes, and begins a romance with Alex. * \\"Over a Barrel\\": Tina & Alex have their first kiss. * \\"Am I Blue\\": Alex kisses Tina for not accusing Gaby as a suspect * \\"Lost in Brooklyn\\": Tina begins middle school, and becomes friends with Safira, a new student from Africa. Rob Baker Rob (portrayed by Todd Alexander) is a shy transfer student from a military family. He wants to be an author, and thus writes many different short stories and poems. Rob is aloof and is reluctant to join the Ghostwriter team at first. Rob is often impulsive and frequently gets himself in dangerous situations. He gets himself trapped in an abandoned subway tunnel, tied up by a maniacal stunt actress, and is nearly assaulted by a street gang when he enters their headquarters. Rob has a strained relationship with his father, who wishes Rob played more sports instead of writing. Rob's family decides to move to Australia during the \\"Lost in Brooklyn\\" case, and Rob's place in the team is assumed by Héctor. Major cases for Rob include: * \\"To Catch a Creep\\": Rob is introduced as a suspect, but later \\"sees\\" Ghostwriter. * \\"Into the Comics\\": After winning the comics contest, Rob joins the team. * \\"To the Light\\": In searching for his homeless friend Double T, Rob is trapped in a subway tunnel. * \\"Building Bridges\\": Rob becomes friends with a former gang member and is attacked in the hideout of the former member's gang. * \\"Get the Message\\": Works with Jamal to get the team back together and prevent Ghostwriter from fading away after the discord within the team. * \\"Lost in Brooklyn\\": Rob's last case, moves to Australia. Héctor Carrero Hector (portrayed by William Hernandez) joins the cast midway through season two. He meets Alex through the Big Brothers mentoring program. He was born in New York City, but grew up in Puerto Rico. He doesn't read and write English very well. Alex helps Hector in his writing and he is improving after joining the team. Hector particularly enjoys playing handball. Major cases for Hector include: * \\"Lost in Brooklyn\\": Hector meets the team and Ghostwriter. * \\"Who Is Max Mouse?\\": Hector defeats George, a bully. Casey Austin Casey (portrayed by Lateaka Vinson) joins the cast midway through season two. She is Jamal's younger cousin who lives in Detroit, but comes to live with the Jenkins while her mother Emmeline (Jamal's father's sister), is in the hospital being treated for alcoholism. Casey is a practical joker with a fondness for peanut butter. Major cases for Casey include: * \\"Don't Stop the Music\\": Casey is suspected of causing pranks on the set of Lenni's music video; and first \\"sees\\" Ghostwriter. * \\"Attack of the Slime Monster\\": Casey enters the team in a contest to write a scary story about \\"Gooey Gus the Slime Monster\\". Craig Mitchell Craig Mitchell (portrayed by Jeremy Miller) is an electronics expert, and only appears in the second arc (the pilot arc), \\"Who Burned Mr. Brinker's Store?\\" (episodes 6-9). After that case ends, he is never seen or mentioned again. Frank, Catherine, and Lucy Frank Flynn, Catherine Canellan, and Lucy Canellan lived in Jamal's house in 1928; all are the children of Irish immigrants. Catherine and Lucy's father, a physician, was Frank's foster father and mentor in medicine. Ghostwriter helps Frank because of his future importance as a cardiac surgeon and to Jamal's family. Catherine was with him when Ghostwriter appeared in front of him, and he later writes to Lucy to convince her to help Frank. After the team helped prove his innocence, Frank eventually followed his mentor's footsteps to become a physician and worked at the Brooklyn Children Hospital. He was also a well-known philanthropist in the city who would help lower-class families who couldn't afford medical care. He performed a heart surgery on Jamal's father, Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Jenkins, when Reggie was four years old. This was pivotal to the formation of the Ghostwriter Team because if Frank hadn't operated on Reggie, Reggie would have died during his childhood. As a result, Jamal would have never been born and Ghostwriter would never have met Jamal. This meant the other team members would never have met Ghostwriter and the team would never have been formed. Under a causal loop of time travels, the Ghostwriter Team is inadvertently responsible of shaping Frank's life as a physician and his eventual operation on Reggie Jenkins, Jamal's and his sister Danitra's births, their first meeting among each other as seen on the five- part pilot episode \\"Ghost Story,\\" and other outcomes throughout the series because of the team's existence. Frank and Catherine are married at some point after they've reached adulthood. Not only has Frank fulfilled his destiny as it should be, but Catherine also becomes a successful mystery novelist. Frank died on May 1, 1992, at the age of 76, a year before the team meets Catherine, and Lucy's fate is never revealed onscreen. Frank, Catherine, and Lucy only appear in the episode \\"Just in Time\\". After that case ends, they are not seen or mentioned again. They were portrayed by Louis Todaro, Grace Johnston, and Stephi Lineburg, and the older version of Catherine was by Augusta Dabney. Sam and Becky Sam and Becky Wentwood live in the United Kingdom. Their parents own a bed and breakfast. They met Jamal and Ghostwriter while Jamal's family was vacationing in London. They only appear in the episode \\"A Crime of Two Cities\\". After that case ends, they are not seen or mentioned again. They were portrayed by Paul Francis and Candace Hallinan. Other cast members Other cast members include: *Lt. Isaiah McQuade (Mike Hodge), a detective serves as the Ghostwriter Team's police contact. *Calvin Ferguson (Wil Horneff in \\"Ghost Story\\", Joey Shea thereafter) is a narcissistic peer of Alex, Jamal, Lenni, Rob, and later Tina at Hurston Middle School, serving as the Ghostwriter Team's enemy. Calvin is jealous of the team's numerous successes in solving their neighborhood's crimes since \\"Ghost Story\\", and is determined to learn their secret, even emulating their investigative methods. *Jeffrey Baxter (Jon Hershfield), Calvin Ferguson's friend. The show's numerous guest stars included Samuel L. Jackson as Jamal's father Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Jenkins in the first three cases (later replaced by Dean Irby), Mark Linn-Baker, Julia Stiles, Max Wright, Spike Lee, Patricia Barry, Daisy Fuentes, Orlagh Cassidy, Judge Reinhold, Melinda Mullins, Annabelle Gurwitch, Robin Leach, Salt-N-Pepa, Madhur Jaffrey, Harry Connick, Jr., CeCe Peniston, David Patrick Kelly, Charles Mann and Bo Jackson.

The engines were initially designated as B class, being a development of the standard B class locomotives designed by Reid some eight years previously, and represented the culmination of a long evolution on the NBR of powerful 0-6-0 freight engines. The new locomotives were introduced in 1914 and had superheaters, inside cylinders and piston valves operated by Stephenson valve gear. Design evolution The North British had built large numbers of 0-6-0 freight engines of earlier classes, and during the incumbency of Matthew Holmes these reached his highly numerous C class design, consisting of 200 locomotives in total (168 of his own engines, later designated LNER class J36, plus 32 rebuilt from the highly similar 1876 design by Dugald Drummond, later designated LNER class J32). Reid set out to develop this design, and improve upon it, producing the standard NBR B class (later LNER class J35), of which 76 examples were built. They were larger and heavier than the earlier engines, and in common with Reid's common practice, had a high boiler pitch. In 1914 Reid ordered the first batch of 5 engines of his improved B class design. From 1914 to 1919 these engines were simply considered to be part of the B class, by which time around 70 had been produced. However, with a new batch ordered in 1919 Reid made several minor alterations, including an increase in working boiler pressure from 165psi to 175 psi. These engines, together with all subsequent batches, were given a new designation, as S class. Several of the earlier locomotives were upgraded to the new 175psi boiler pressure, and redesignated as S class. Finally, upon grouping in 1923, the LNER upgraded all of the S class engines and all of the improved B class engines, to a working boiler pressure of 180psi, and formally grouped them all together into the J37 class. The improved B class J37s and the S class J37s together totalled 104 engines. Numbering A total of 104 locomotives was built by the North British Railway, all of which passed to the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) at grouping, and all of which came into British Railways (BR) ownership at nationalisation in 1948. BR numbers were 64536–64639.Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, 1948 edition, part 4, p.29 Performance The improved B class (J37) and S class (J37) locomotives performed admirably on fast mainline freight services, and heavy Fife coal trains. On some parts of the network (notably the West Highland Line) they were used for both freight and passenger duties. The engines have been described as being the most successful and the most powerful 0-6-0 tender engines ever employed in Scotland. Preservation Number 4592 approaching Edinburgh Waverley railway station in August 1948. Like the earlier standard B class (J35), none of which survived after withdrawal, the improved B class (J37) and S class (J37) engines were all scrapped. No example survived for preservation.

Isobel Wylie Hutchison (30 May 1889-20 February 1982) was a Scottish Arctic traveller and botanist. She also wrote poetry, books on her travels and articles in various geographic magazines. She painted many scenes from her adventures. Early life Carlowrie Castle, built by the Hutchison family in the mid 19th century. Hutchison was born at Carlowrie Castle in West Lothian, the third of five children of Thomas Hutchison (1841-1900) and Jeannie Wylie (1857-1931). Her uncle was Robert Hutchison of Carlowrie FRSE. Her grandfather Thomas Hutchison (1796-1852) had been Provost of Leith and was well-established in the wine wholesaling trade, and his father-in-law had been a successful farmer; his wealth enabled him to spend a great deal of time with Isobel, teaching her about botany and gardening. She also received a private education from a governess, and was very active physically at croquet, tennis, archery, skating, hiking, cycling, Scottish country dancing and walking. From 1900, she attended school in Edinburgh, where she studied a curriculum suited for a Victorian gentlewoman. After her sister married a naval officer and saw very little of him for long periods, Isobel decided that marriage would restrict her life. Her father died when she was ten years old, but he left equal provision for all of the children with trusts, and so she was independent for the whole of her life. Hutchison confessed to wanting to be a poet and started writing while young. She kept diaries assiduously from 1903, and edited \\"The Scribbler\\", a magazine created by the family, which she continued to write even into her twenties. A polyglot, by the time she was an adult she could speak Italian, Gaelic, Greek, Hebrew, Danish, Icelandic, Greenlandic and some Inuit words. From her early years she had gone for long walks, and would often walk the eight miles from Carlowrie to Edinburgh, spurning the family motorcar. These walks reached 100 miles when she was twenty, e.g. Blairgowrie to Fort Augustus (100 miles), and Doune to Oban (70 miles). Later on she went for long \\"strolls\\" and wrote articles for the National Geographic Magazine afterwards. Hutchison's youngest brother, Frank, died in 1912 at the age of 16 in a climbing accident in the Cairngorms. This had a profound effect on her, and she stopped writing in her diary for a time. Another brother, Walter, was killed in the First World War. From 1917 to 1918, Hutchison studied business training and marketing, as well as religion and language, at Studley College in Warwickshire, which had been set up for the education of young women in agriculture. During 1918, things were very bad, with little food for the animals and all the men gone to the war. Influenza swept through the college and some students died. She went through emotional problems while she was there. Post war Though she suffered a mental breakdown in 1920, she was sustained by her continued success with her writing; her poetry was acclaimed by The Scotsman , and she began writing a novel. Thus her legacy from her father was increased by the fees she received. In 1924, in common with the usual practice, Hutchison went on tour to Spain, Morocco, Egypt and Israel. She went with a female companion, who was rather over-protective, causing Hutchison to resolve to travel alone in future. In later life she found male companions much preferable, though she never married. On her return to Scotland, she spent some time walking on Barra, North and South Uist, Harris, Scotland and Lewis, and completed a 150-mile trek. She wrote an article for the National Geographic Magazine and received $250, which partially paid for her trip to Iceland. Arctic adventures Iceland Reykjavik in the 1920s. Hutchison got the idea of travelling to Iceland in 1924, while sitting upon the beach at the Butt of Lewis. This started out very much as a holiday tour. She went to Reykjavik for about a month and looked at the geysers and other tourist sights. After attending a lecture by Jean-Baptiste Charcot, she decided to walk round Iceland. This was unheard of by the local guides, who refused to organise a trip. Eventually one guide did give her a route to follow, on which she was frequently got lost. However the Icelanders were very hospitable, and helped her by lending her ponies, for which they often refused to accept payment. Although she was very impressed with the flowers on Iceland she was not collecting seriously on this visit. After returning to Scotland, she wrote another article for National Geographic which they published as a major 30 page feature. Greenland This was not so easy to visit as Iceland. The Danish authorities monitored those who visited the country closely, but as she was travelling on official permission to collect flowers for various organisations she got a visa quite easily. She travelled by sea and spent much time living on board while exploring the east of the country in July 1927. She did, however, visit and get to know many Greenlanders. She was very careful to keep in with the Danish officials and their wives, as there was still a large difference in status between the Danes and the native people. Greenland had a thriving Christian community which Hutchison, as a regular churchgoer, joined enthusiastically. Consequently, whenever a pastor was going to visit an outlying village she would be offered a lift with him in his boat, meaning she was able to see several ancient churches and cathedrals, of which there were a large number. At each stop she would collect flowers and plants which she would then send back home. The town of Angmagssalik, founded in 1895, was still very primitive when Hutchison arrived in 1927. She stayed there for four days and collected flowers, sailing in an umiak and visiting a Greenlandic tent home. She bought kamiker (thigh length boots) and wore them to keep out the biting insects. Her next visit was to Augpilagtok, where cliffs rise thousands of feet out of the sea. Isobel was horrified to see how poor the Greenlanders were. She gave one woman her last pair of spare socks, and commissioned a carver to make a model of a kayak in order to give him some money (this model is now in the National Museum of Scotland). When Isobel arrived in Julianehab there were no hotels or hostels. She stayed with the district manager, but ate on board the ship. However she joined in Scottish country dancing, which had been introduced by Scottish whalers, with Greenlanders and her fellow passengers. Her next stop was Igaliko where she met Hans Reynolds, a Norwegian scientist, who showed her ruins from the 10th century and remains of the cathedral from 1146. She found over 50 plants there and some barley. She later visited several Danish settlements near Cape Farewell. It was not possible to reach Cape Farewell itself, so Isobel landed at Nanortalik, where she stayed with the Danish manager Mr Mathieson, who helped her journey to an island of birch trees, in an umiak with six rowers and a steersman. This voyage took five days, and Hutchison regarded it as one of the best times of her life. Before leaving Greenland, Hutchison met Dr Knud Rasmussen, who became a firm friend. She returned to Scotland on the Disko, arriving at Leith on Christmas morning, 1927. She had made many friends during her visit to Greenland, and Dr Rasmussen came to stay at Carlowrie. In April 1928 she got permission to visit the west of Greenland, and spent the next six months preparing. In August she sailed to Disko Island. Part of the Umanak fjord. There she met Dr Morton Porsild, Director of the Arctic Research Station, who gave her advice on what seeds to collect and where they could be found. She would then send these on to the Royal Horticultural Society. She moved to Umanak where about ten Danes lived with many locals. She stayed in a vacant three-bedroom house, and a housekeeper was found for her called Dortha, who would later become a close friend. Initially Hutchison could only speak Danish but she shortly learnt Greenlandic. She spent some time collecting plants on Nugssuak, and also sketched on this trip. Later she went to Igdlorssuit (Unknown Island) and then to Upernivik, where she stayed in a very basic hut. By this point, she had filled 300 envelopes with seeds. During the winter she gave a film show using the projector she had brought. Hutchison had brought many books with her, and she lent these to her Danish friends. She had also brought her steel skates (the locals only had wooden ones) and received much exercise. She attended church regularly with Dortha, and often went to local coffee mornings. Sanitation was a problem, with typhoid and consumption ever present; at one point Dortha fell ill, and Hutchison was forced to do all the housework herself. Hutchison had spent seven months in the bay, during which time she had learnt much about the way of life and the tensions which existed between the two communities. The dark nights made the social life full of parties and coffee mornings. The winter of 1928 was very hard, and the temperature fell to 10 degrees F, causing the bay to freeze solid. Isobel went fishing through the ice, which she enjoyed and became the subject of a poem. Dogs in the village had to be killed for food and fur, which upset her. Normally they lived on seal and halibut. By April, daylight was sufficient to turn off the constant oil light. When the ice started to melt, she was able to leave Disko Island and go on tour with the pastor to visit other communities around the Umanak Bay, meaning she could look for more plants and flowers. At each community the pastor carried out communion services, which much impressed her, and became the subject of three or four poems. She got to know the eight rowers well, and know spoke Greenlandic fluently. At the end of the trip, she landed on Unknown Island, staying for a month in a small Danish house. She made several botanical excursions in the manager's motorboat to visit other nearby islands. Her time here was her happiest in Greenland, and she is recorded as having said \\"I am glad to be alone\\". From here Hutchison could see the mountain on Nugsuuaq, which she decided to climb. Helped by a team of two local men, she succeeded in reaching the summit at 6250 feet, after twelve hours of climbing. On a cold day in late August 1929 she left the Umanak Bay. Her next book, On Greenland’s Closed Shore, was received with much acclaim, and over the next two years she gave many lectures and talks on the BBC, and wrote articles and poems. Alaska Dawson. Hutchsion was inspired to go to Alaska after reading a book on the American Arctic. Leaving Manchester by cargo boat on 3 May 1933, she crossed the Atlantic, passed through the Panama Canal, then travelled up the western coast of America. There were only six passengers, but she traveled in reasonable comfort. After a brief stop in Vancouver, she travelled up the Inside Passage to Ketchikan and then disembarked at Skagway. She took the railway from there to Whitepass where she caught the sternwheeler Casca for a comfortable trip down the Yukon. On board the ship she met various people who gave her useful information about how to travel and where to winter. Nome in 1900. The boat was delayed in Dawson. Always ready to climb mountains, while here she tackled the Dome (1500 ft) with Harry Lester, a Mountie whom she had met on board the Casca. She also met several local botanists, who told what plants to collect and where to get them. She was advised to send all her luggage to Aklavik, as the Anyox, which she had hoped to catch, had been damaged. She arrived at Fort Yukon at midnight, where she was met by friends of people she had met on board. She went to Tenana and then Nenana as the next boat was running late. Vilhjalmur Stefansson, an Arctic explorer whom she had already met, pointed out that she would not be able to complete her journey unless she speeded up by flying to Nome. She had over 360 kilograms of luggage, meaning the flight cost her $250. She enjoyed the flight, as it was only her second, but she had to land at Nulato overnight before arriving at Nome next day. In a short time Hutchison made friends amongst the leading citizens of Nome. She ate in local restaurants, and acquired much useful information. The repaired Anyox could not pick her up at Nome because of very thick ice, and there were no other large ships on which could travel, meaning she was forced to spend five weeks in Nome. She met a local botanist, Charles Thornton, who helped her to collect 200 of the 278 local plants. She also met a Russian trader named Ira Rank, who had a small boat imaginatively called the Trader. He told her that from Nome to Point Barrow was 500 miles, which could, with luck, be done in five days. However, the boat was very small, and Hutchison was forced to share a cabin with Rank, while the boat's two other crewmen slept by the engine. Testament to her adaptability, Hutchison was quite happy to go from travelling in luxury to travelling with three Russians in a cramped and smelly boat. The Trader visited many Eskimo villages on the north coast. They entered the Bering Strait on 2 August, but ran into a gale and pack ice, forcing them to shelter in the Prince of Wales Bay for two days, during which time Hutchison went for walks and hunted plants. They were fed and entertained by two tin miners. As the next day was calm they reached Point Hope where there was an old Eskimo village. The inhabitants lived on whales, walrus and seals. Isobel went collecting flowers with the wife of the local teacher. She also bought some Eskimo artefacts, and would have liked to have stayed longer. They headed past Port Lisburne and on to Cape Lay, before travelling inland through a series of shallow lagoons. Hutchison saw her first ice cake here. They anchored by one, but it took them back twelve miles during the night. On 11 August, they reached Wainwright, one of the largest Eskimo communities where they traded. They heard that the SS Baychimo, a \\"ghost ship\\" belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company which had been trapped in the ice and abandoned, had been sighted only twelve miles out. The men were all for going out and seeing what they could salvage. The Baychimo in 1931. There was still much useful equipment on it, though Eskimos had already raided it. The crew of the Trader wanted to take the whole ship, but it was too big for them and so took only some valuable items. By this time, Hutchison had fully adapted to life on the Trader, and had become friendly with the crewmen. The Trader inched her way forward to Singet, which was only 25 miles from Barrow. Here they stayed in an old Eskimo cabin which she helped Ira Rank to clean up. On 1 September, a lead opened up and they were able to reach Barrow. The Trader was unable to progress any further, and so Hutchison was introduced to Gus Masik, who had a boat called the Hazel with two Eskimos as crew. After a sad farewell to the crew of the Trader, Hutchison departed on the Hazel on 9 September. They crossed Smith Bay and anchored in fog at Thetis Island. At Beech Point they met an old friend of Masik's, Aarnout Castel. Hutchison liked Mrs Castel and talked to her in the kitchen while the men traded goods. They went on to Flaxman Island where there was a trading post. She went ashore for a walk, enjoying the peace and beauty. The Hazel then crossed Camden Bay passing Barter Island, and eventually arrived at Martin Point on 15 September. Painting by Hutchison of Gus Masik in his cabin at Martin Point. There were now only 120 miles to Herschel Island, where Hutchison wanted to winter. However the ice closed in four days later and they were locked in for the winter, and Hutchison was forced to stay in Masik's one-roomed hut on Martin Point. Hutchison spent the time collecting flowers and having religious discussions with Masik, whose life story she wrote down and later published. At the end of October, she went to visit Tom Gordon, a giant Scotsman who had been a whaling ship captain, but had been forced to become a trader after his ship was destroyed by the ice. He lived, with his native wife and myriad offspring, in a two-roomed cabin with a lean- to. Hutchison described it as a Scottish-Eskimo household filled with characters, and stayed here for seven weeks. On 3 November, she set out on sledge with Gus Masik for Herschel Island. They arrived on the noon of the fourth day, and Hutchison was warmly welcomed by the local agent. Eight miles long and four miles wide, the island was normally busy with ships but in winter accommodated only four white people and two Eskimo families. Masik stayed two more days and then left. Hutchison would see him again at Nome and then at Carlowrie. Special Constable Ethier and his wife would look after her for two days, before organising a local guide to take her to Aklavik. Aklavik. They left on 10 November, in −20 degrees, and arrived at Head Point at four o'clock. The next day, a young Inuk called Isaac was paid to take her to Shingle Point. It was 20 degrees colder than the previous day, and Hutchison was forced to run behind the sled to keep warm. When she arrived at Shingle Point she was fed royally by three English ladies and Mr Webster, the Anglican minister. There was a school here, and she started to wonder about the effect the white teachers were having on the Eskimos: English was no use to them when they went back to their families. In addition, many illnesses were being brought in and several Eskimos were sick or had died. She stayed here for thirteen days, but on 23 November, a group set off for Aklavik. It was so cold that they turned back after two hours. The next day was warmer, and two days later they reached Aklavik. This was a well established town and the administrative centre for the area. The church and police had bases here, and planes and ships arrived here. Hutchison joined in the social life, but was a curiosity as a single woman. Not wishing to cause offence, she was very careful to edit her accounts of how she stayed with the various traders and Eskimos. She left the town on by aeroplane on 5 February, and after several legs, arrived in Winnipeg. From here she caught the Alaunier, and got back to Scotland in the beginning of March. Her exploits had gone before her to Britain, and there had been a report of her activities in the Times on 10 January. Aleutian Islands Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands. In the last week of May 1936, Hutchison left Scotland for Montreal, whence she travelled to Winnipeg and finally Seattle, where she caught the Yukon for a journey along the coast reaching Seward. She found that the information she had been given about ships and sailing times in Washington was theoretical, and so had to adapt accordingly. She had booked a passage on the Starr, but this would be three weeks late, and so she also booked on the Curaçao. This took her overnight to Kodiak, Alaska, where she booked into the Sunbeam Hotel. In the two weeks she spent waiting for the Starr's arrival, she explored the area and collected specimens. The Starr turned out to be quite a scruffy ship and there was limited room in the cabins, though she met several old friends whom she had got to know from her time on the north coast of Alaska. At Unalaska she disembarked, as this was the limit of the Starr's voyage. She knew that she would have to trust to her luck to get any further west by small fishing and trading boats. She became well known in the area through her participation in the local church. Luckily a small schooner called the Penguin was travelling on to St George Island, and she quickly booked a passage. She also managed to obtain further passage through her friend Commodore Ralf Dempwolf, who arranged transport for her on a cutter called the Chelan. She continued her journey on the Penguin to St Paul Island, where she collected more specimens and took cine pictures of seals and their harems. She received a radio message that she could be picked up there by the Chelan and so she found herself having to climb up a rope ladder to get on board. Because of the articles she had written in the National Geographic and other well-respected publications, she had quite a standing in the naval community. Once on board she was treated handsomely and given a large cabin to herself. She dined with the officers, and the chef spent much time preparing high-quality meals for her. The ship had a duty to inspect Bogoslof Island each year as it was constantly changing its shape. Hutchison was unable to land there due to the sea condition, but she took cine pictures of it. They then passed Umnak Island and the Island of the Four Mountains. Their first stop was at At, where the Aleut people had been living for over two thousand years. As well as collecting plants she was very interested in everything about the inhabitants' way of life. Quite often a member of the crew was detailed to look after Hutchison and help her collect specimens. The ship continued westward to the isle of Amchitka. A submerged mountain range had been discovered here and the ship needed to chart it. The Chelan spent a week charting the waters round this area, which varied from 4000 to 49 fathoms, and had caused the losses of several coastguard ships. Attu village in June 1937. Hutchison wanted if possible to land on Attu. For two days this was impossible, but on the third day it was safe to anchor and for her to go ashore with two sailors. If the weather got worse they would be left onshore until the ship could come back. They worked very hard and found 69 plants. The people of Attu were very friendly and Hutchison often photographed them. Six years later the Japanese attacked these island and killed many of the people. The rest were taken to a prison camp in Japan where many perished. The ship then went on to Kiska where there was an American naval base. They stayed there several days, and Hutchison was able to climb the mountain south of the harbour, where she took photos, collected specimens and wrote a poem. The Chelan then set sail back east. She had spent three weeks on board with a group of ninety sailors, and had travelled a thousand miles in some of the most dangerous seas in the world. They were obviously very impressed by her, as they made her an admiral's pennant inscribed with \\"Isobel Hutchison, Admiral of the Bering\\". When she got back to Alaska, she managed to visit nearly all her old friends and show them photos of her latest adventures. Hutchison carried on travelling for the rest of her life. Non-Arctic adventures Isobel Wylie Hutchison at home with her dog. *1936: Japan, China, Trans-Siberian Railway, Moscow, Poland, Berlin *1938: Estonia *1946: Denmark *1948: \\"stroll\\" from Carlowrie to London *1950: \\"stroll\\" from Innsbruck to Venice *1952: \\"stroll\\" from Edinburgh to John o' Groats In the late 1950s, she only made short journeys to Europe, as well as leading a National Trust cruise to the Fair Isle and St Kilda. In the '60s she stopped travelling, but when she was 65 she cycled from Carlowrie to Bettyhill. Other activities Post-War, Hutchison gave talks frequently on the BBC. Carlowrie was very run down after the war, having been used by the RAF, and she needed to carry on working to pay for the repairs and upgrades. They didn't even have electricity until 1951. In later life she suffered from arthritis, but this did not stop her working. She died at Carlowrie in 1982, aged 92. She is buried in the northern cemetery in Kirkliston, with her eldest sister, Hilda Scott Primrose Hutchison. The grave of Isobel Wylie Hutchison, Kirkliston Cemetery Legacy Although Isobel is less well known than many of her male contemporaries within the fields of exploration and botany, her achievements are nonetheless extraordinary. Carlowrie Castle, Isobel's family home where expeditions aside, she spent 93 years, has launched a program to raise awareness of Isobel, her great endeavours and her legacy.https://carlowriecastle.co.uk/history/ Ahead of Isobel's 130th birthday next year Carlowrie Castle has worked with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and Edinburgh-based bespoke design studio Craft Design House to launch The Isobel Wylie Hutchison Collection, where every piece tells a different part of Isobel's extraordinary story. The Collection has been thoroughly researched and is intended to carry Isobel's extraordinary exploits to new audiences in current and future generations, both within the walls of Carlowrie Castle and further afield, and the collection will continue to grow over the coming years. The collection has been met with enthusiasm by the artisans who participated in the creation of the collection but also by the wider public who have been inspired by her intrepid explorations, fearless feats and her humility, particularly in a time when women weren't expected to venture beyond the domestic sphere and one reporter went so far as to claim: \\"Miss Hutchison is, you feel, much too fragile and gentle for the rigours of Arctic exploration. Dispensing tea in her sunlit sitting room, or sketching the glowing colours of her garden, she seems far more in her correct setting than battling against cold and hardship in half-civilised lands.\\" The Scotsman, 2 November 1939. The collection launch which took place on 24 October (the same date Isobel received her Mungo Park Medal in 1934) welcomed Martin Hartley and Myrtle Simpson, both exceptional explorers in their own right as speakers, continuing the narrative and inspirational achievements of Arctic exploration and research. A donation of 10% from all sales of the collection will go to supporting the educational work of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. She is honoured with a blue plaque at Carlowrie Castle. Books and articles She wrote six books of poems, seven books on her travels and twelve articles for the National Geographic Magazine. Poetry *Lyrics from West Lothian.

History The original Point Bridge This is the Pittsburgh Point Bridge II looking north across the Monongahela River in 1951. Point Bridge I In 1877, a suspension bridge called the Point Bridge was built over the Monongahela River, and is retroactively referred to as Point Bridge I by locals since being replaced by the second Point Bridge, which is sometimes called \\"Point Bridge II\\".http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/PointBridge.htmlhttp://pghbridges.com/pittsburghW/0583-4477/point1877.htm Point Bridge II The bridge was constructed from 1925-1927 and was opened to traffic on 20 June 1927. Dismantling of the old Point Bridge began that following August, and on October 9 the span was brought down into the Monongahela River by cutting the last cables holding it in place. The new Point Bridge was constructed by the Fort Pitt Bridge Works of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania and was situated closer to the point than its Allegheny River counterpart, the Manchester Bridge. Its north end landed roughly where the plaza around the Point State Park fountain begins, and its south end landed less than a tenth of a mile east of the Duquesne Incline. The bridge passed over an elevated span above the Point to connect the two bridges. The Point Bridge II was closed to traffic on June 21, 1959, two days after the dedication and grand opening of the Fort Pitt Bridge. It remained standing until demolition began on April 15, 1970 and was completed that following November. The south landing remains, partly shrouded by trees, between West Station Square Drive and West Carson Street. In 2008, a headstone marking the duration of the bridge's construction was found abandoned on the hillside across from the old south landing; it is now on display at nearby Station Square.

Overview In the U.S., each citizen is granted a credit against the gift and estate tax. When gifts and bequests exceed the amount of this credit, a tax is imposed. For estate tax purposes, any property which passes to a decedent's surviving spouse is not subject to the gift or estate tax; however, generally full ownership of this property must in fact pass to the surviving spouse. A transfer through a QTIP Trust is an exception to this general rule. Under Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code, as long as the surviving spouse has a lifetime income interest in the property, the property is treated as passing to the surviving spouse.Section 2056 The concept of a \\"QTIP trust\\" exists only for federal gift and estate tax purposes, and from a state law perspective, such a trust does not differ from any other trust except that it must meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. States which levy an estate tax may also recognize the trust. Illustration For example, if a Grandpa gives $100,000 to Grandma, this would be a gift to a spouse, exempt from the gift and estate tax. However, if Grandpa were to give the $100,000 to Grandson, this would be included for gift and estate tax purposes. However, Grandpa can place this $100,000 in a QTIP trust which will make payments of money to Grandma during her life, and have the money in the trust pass to Grandson when Grandma dies. This is treated as a marital gift to Grandma, exempt from the gift and estate tax, to the extent of any property received. The amount passing to the Grandson upon the death of Grandma will be included in Grandma's estate for estate tax consideration. Practical use QTIP trusts are commonly used when a spouse has children from another marriage. The other spouse may wish to provide for this spouse and take advantage of the spouse's unified credit against gift and estate tax, but nonetheless designate where the money will go after that spouse is deceased. A QTIP trust allows this to be accomplished in a manner treated as a gift to a spouse.

He now operates a small communications firm in suburban New Jersey. Early life In 1942, his father, Dr. Nathan M. Becker, a professor of economics, accepted a position at The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Becker lived there until he was 4 and then toward the end of World War II, his parents moved to Washington DC as his father accepted a position working for Adlai Stevenson in the State Department. Becker's father eventually took a position at Pace University and from the age of 13 Becker grew up with his brother and sister in West Orange, New Jersey (Pace University maintains an annual Nathan Becker Memorial Scholarship for students who major in economics ). He graduated from Syracuse University and after military service delivered traffic helicopter reports for three years for a New York/New Jersey radio station. He was one of the first helicopter traffic reporters in the country. Becker traveled to several major European countries to see if their major radio stations were interested in helicopter traffic reports but they were not. Advertising career In 1966 Becker was trained and hired by an advertising executive named Bill (William) Casey. He began his advertising career as a copywriter at Papert Koenig Lois. Much of Becker’s career was spent at Young & Rubicam Advertising (26 years in total). He left to spend three years as Vice Chairman, Chief Creative Officer at Ted Bates Worldwide and then to BBDO as Executive Vice President, Senior Creative Director and member of the Board. He returned to Young & Rubicam, hired by Chairman and CEO Alex Kroll, to work at their direct marketing division Wunderman. At Y&R; companies, Becker created the award winning 25-year television campaign, \\"I’m stuck on Band-Aid ‘cause Band-Aid’s stuck on me\\". (\\"Mike Becker and I wrote the song. Barry Manilow got the residuals. John Travolta and Terri Garr both launched careers,\\" states Harry Webber, Becker's collaborator on this project, which led to a 1976 Clio Award and the composition of one of the most recognizable advertising jingles of all time.) He led the creation and production of the 10-year American Express Corporate Card campaign \\"To Your Success\\". In 1970 Becker partnered with the then head of the Young & Rubicam Art Department, Donald Egensteiner, to create the theme and advertising for Mayor Lindsay's commencement of annual Earth Day celebrations in New York City. The theme line they created for the campaign was: \\"April 22, 1970. Earth Day. The beginning of the end of pollution\\". In 1991 he created a print and television campaign for a private commission named by Mayor David N. Dinkins titled \\"Operation Welcome Home.\\" The purpose was to raise money and awareness for what would become the biggest ticker-tape parade in the city's history, a salute to all veterans, and a welcome home to soldiers from the Gulf War. Advertising and marketing In September 1998, he formed beckercommunications to advise clients on marketing, advertising and public relations. Becker was instrumental in building the creative team for Bill Bradley for President in that same year. In 2000 Becker named a non- profit organization and website, The Hemangioma Treatment Foundation. Becker’s theme line is “Kids Birthmarks. We Care. We Cure.\\" Working with longtime art director and commercial film director Stew Birbrower, Becker created a full campaign including a public service television announcement that starred actress Dyan Cannon. Personal life He is married to Katherine A. Becker, who was the first female president of an art directors club in America (Art Directors Club of New Jersey, 1969–70).

Sir Fulke's second wife, Isabel of Lingen, who was also Vernon's mother-in-law, had founded a chantry and college of a warden and four chaplains at Tong to pray for the souls of her three husbands.Victoria County History: Shropshire, volume 2, chapter 35. She bequeathed advowson of the church to Vernon, and also settled her manor of Haselbech, Northamptonshire, on him. In 1415, prior to launching his invasion of France, Henry V induced parliament to dissolve all alien priories: monastic houses subsidiary to abbeys in France. This included Lapley Priory, a small Benedictine house on the western edge of Staffordshire. Its lands were given to Tong college, greatly improving the income of the chaplains and putting the chantry on a much more secure footing. It is possible that this was brought about by a member of the House of Beaufort, the king's cousins, to whom Sir Fulke had been very close. Tong church was to become a shrine for the Vernon family, accommodating generations of elaborate tombs. Vernon also tried to acquire the substantial estates of Sir Fulke's first wife, Margaret Trussell, which had been settled on Isabel for life. The legal wrangles with the Trussell family dragged on inconclusively for more than 20 years. Career Vernon was advanced £45 10s. by the Exchequer in June 1416 to cover service in France, in which he was engaged for a few months. £40 a year was considered sufficient to support a knight, while £9 would pay an archer.,Barker, Juliet (2006): Agincourt, London (Abacus Books), , p. 116. so it is possible Vernon campaigned with a small force. If so, the most likely destination was Harfleur, where the English garrison was left stranded after the Agincourt campaign. The Armagnac besiegers were scattered in a daring relief operation, led by John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford on 15 August.Barker, Juliet (2010): Conquest, The English Kingdom of France in the Hundred Years War, London (Abacus Books), . This fits well with Vernon's subsequent career, as he must have returned to the Midlands by November. In November 1416 Vernon was pricked High Sheriff of Staffordshire. That period of office was followed by a knighthood and he was appointed Justice of the Peace for Staffordshire, a post he held for five years. He was then chosen as one of the arbitrators in a dispute between the abbot of Burton Abbey and Thomas Okeover, a quarrelsome Derbyshire landowner and politician. He was twice appointed Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, in 1425 and 1426, and was made High Sheriff of Staffordshire again in 1427. Vernon became a member of Parliament for the first time in 1419, as a knight of the shire for Staffordshire. He was one of a number of Derbyshire magnates who were summoned early in 1420 to Westminster to discuss the defence of Normandy. His services to the Crown extended to advancing a loan of £52 10s, in concert with the Essex landowners, Sir William Coggeshall and Richard Baynard, who became Speaker the following year. 1421 marked the high point of Henry V's French campaigns, with Normandy under firm English control, the king wed to Catherine of Valois, the French king's daughter, and English forces pressing south and east of Paris. However, Henry died in 1422, leaving an infant son to succeed him. Vernon represented Derbyshire in the parliament of 1422, the first of Henry VI's reign. In the following year he was appointed steward of the Duchy of Lancaster's estates in the High Peak, Derbyshire. He represented Derbyshire again in the parliament of 1426 and was elected Speaker of the House of Commons. The parliament met at Leicester Castle and was called the Parliament of Bats because members were forbidden to wear swords for fear of violence, and so carried clubs or bats. The key issue was the power struggle between the boy king's relatives, Cardinal Beaufort and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Vernon had links with the Beauforts and their influence may have secured him the speakership, and possibly the stewardship of the High Peak. If this was so, he must have proved a disappointment, as the parliament largely favoured Gloucester. However, he was able to advance his own interests considerably. Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland was a minor and a ward of the king. He petitioned the House for an increased allowance and his request met with approval. Vernon was a tenant of the earl and also held the manor of Ashford-in-Bakewell, Derbyshire, at a farm of £42, during the minority of the earl, so he stood to gain from this measure. He was even delegated to handle the actual payments to Neville. Vernon became involved in serious disturbances during the 1433 elections in Derbyshire. Henry, Lord Grey of Codnor, formerly a friend of Vernon, brought a force of 200 men to Derby on 24 June, intending to dictate the outcome of the election. Next day Vernon and Sir John Cokayne, a notoriously violent landowner from AshbourneHistory of Parliament Online: Members 1386–1421 – COKAYNE, Sir John (d.1438) – Authors: J. S. Roskell / L. S. Woodger arrived with a much larger force and had themselves declared members of parliament. The clash became linked to a property dispute between Thomas Foljambe of Chesterfield, a client of Vernon, and Sir Henry Pierrepont of Holme Pierrepont Hall. Foljambe's retainers launched a murderous attack on Pierrpont and his men in Chesterfield Parish Church. Sessions of oyer and terminer were held at Derby in 1433 to investigate the affair. The first jury to sit was headed by Pierrepont himself and naturally held Foljambe responsible for the whole dispute. A second jury included Vernon and Cockayne, and was more sympathetic to Foljambe. Ultimately, no resolution was reached. Within four years, Vernon and Grey were on good terms again, engaged in joint enterprises. Vernon was elected in 1436 to represent Derbyshire in the parliament of 1437 without undue drama. Powerful though he was, Vernon felt the need of backing from even more powerful magnates in times of conflict. From 1430 he was increasingly linked with Humphrey Stafford, who was to become Duke of Buckingham in 1444. In 1440, Vernon made a formal agreement with Stafford, agreeing to support him with a retinue of six mounted men. For this, he was to receive a life annuity of £20. The alliance fitted with Vernon's wider connections. Stafford was also loosely allied to the House of Beaufort and was to be crucial in the arrest and overthrow of Gloucester in 1447. The Stafford connection was to prove crucial in advancing Vernon's subsequent career. Stafford protected him against the growing tide of complaints about his maladministration and oppression in the High Peak. As Marcher Lord of Brecon, Stafford was also able to open up preferment for Vernon in South Wales, where he already had considerable interests. Vernon was a deputy justiciar of south Wales (1431 – c. 1438) under James, Lord Audley, and during 1440–45 itinerant justice in the lordship of Brecon. By 1445 was serving as knight steward in the court of the Lord High Constable, another office occupied by Humphrey Stafford, now Duke of Buckingham, as well as in the court of the Earl Marshal (John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk), another magnate whom Vernon cultivated. In June 1450 he was appointed Sheriff of Pembroke, Llanstephan and St Clears for life. He also became constable of Pembroke Castle and Tenby Castle and secured numerous profitablee stewardships in the region. However, there were tensions between Vernon and his patrons, particularly as Buckingham was also allied with Sir William Trussell, with whom Vernon conducted a protracted and sometimes violent feud. Buckingham had become constable of Calais by 1444, and he was undoubtedly responsible for Vernon's appointment as Treasurer of Calais in 1445 and as receiver and keeper of the Calais mint in the following year, posts he held until the year of his death. However they were a mixed blessing. As treasurer, Vernon ran up large debts, for which he was held personally responsible. On his death in August 1451, these passed to his eldest surviving son and successor, William, who had already succeeded him as treasurer. The Crown seized Harlaston as security and it seems that William never managed fully to meet his father's debts. Marriage and family Tong Church Richard Vernon married Benedicta (sometimes rendered Bennet) Ludlow. She was the daughter of Sir John Ludlow of Hodnet, Shropshire and Isabel de Lingen, the foundress of the chantry and college of Tong. They had at least four sons and four daughters. These include: * Richard, Vernon's original heir, who predeceased him, and whose widow retained a large life interest in the Vernon estates. * Sir William, his eldest surviving son, who inherited his main estates, some of his offices, and debts. * Fulke, who was joint steward of High Peak with Vernon and captain of Mammes castle in the Calais pale. * John, who became High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire. * Elenor who married Sir Richard Wheelock of Chesire, England * Benedicta, who married Sir Thomas Charlton, soon to be Speaker. * Elizabeth who married the Attorney General, John Vampage of Worcester (d.1446).Douglas Richardson.

One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 23 *Conservative 22 *Liberal Democrats 5 *Independent 2 Background Before the election Labour were the largest party with 23 councillors, compared to 21 Conservatives, 7 Liberal Democrats and 1 independent. However the council was run by a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. 18 seats were being contested at the election by a total of 68 candidates. Both the Conservative and Labour parties stood in all 18 seats, while there were 10 Liberal Democrat candidates, 9 British National Party, 6 Green Party, 5 Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, 1 UK Independence Party and 1 independent. The Socialist and Trade Union candidates included 2 former Labour mayors, Craig Johnston and John Metcalfe, while the independent Robert Betton had won Botcherby on Cumbria County Council at the 2009 election and was facing the same Labour opponent, Anne Glendinning, as in 2009. Election result No party won a majority, with Labour remaining the largest party on 23 seats, but the Conservatives gained a seat to move to 22 councillors. The Liberal Democrats lost 2 seats to drop to 5 councillors, while a second independent councillor was elected to the council. Overall turnout at the election was 64.5%, up from 38.1% in 2008. This was as the election took place at the same time as the general election, where Conservative John Stevenson gained Carlisle constituency from Labour by 853 votes. Labour gained Morton from the Liberal Democrats, defeating the Liberal Democrat group leader Peter Farmer, who announced his retirement from politics after his defeat. However Labour fell 14 votes short of taking Castle from the Liberal Democrats and lost Botcherby to independent Robert Betton. Meanwhile, the Conservatives gained Dalston from the Liberal Democrats, after the sitting Liberal Democrat councillor Steven Tweedie stepped down at the election. Following the election Reg Watson became the new leader of the Labour group on the council, as Michael Boaden had stepped down after being defeated as Labour candidate at the general election. Conservative Mike Mitchelson, who held his seat at the election, was re-elected as leader of the council, continuing the alliance with the Liberal Democrats. Ward results By-elections between 2010 and 2011 A by-election was held on 16 September 2010 for Stanwix Urban, after John Stevenson resigned from the council on being elected as a Member of Parliament. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Paul Nedved with a majority of 400 over Labour.

It was formed in 1867, the same year as the beginning of the country and it elected members up until 1999 when it was dissolved. Initially it covered a large swath of territory stretching from Lake Ontario north to Richmond Hill. It was formed based on the eastern part of the county of York. Over time as the population increased, the territory was reduced. By the late 1950s it represented only a portion of the borough of East York, a small municipality on the edge of Toronto. In 1999 it was abolished and its remaining territory was distributed between Beaches—East York and Don Valley West ridings. Boundaries In 1867, the County of York was subdivided into four ridings, York East, York North, York South, and York West. York East consisted of the townships of Markham, Scarborough, and any areas east of Yonge Street excluding the city of Toronto. It also included the village of Yorkville. These boundaries coincided with the Federal riding of the same name. In 1874, the village of Richmond Hill was removed. In 1885, Richmond Hill was added back. In 1926 portions of the riding were lost to the new ridings of Eglinton and Beaches. This reflected changes to the boundaries of the city of Toronto. By 1963, the boundaries had been reduced to encompass a portion of territory within the bounds of Metro Toronto. This consisted of the area South of Steeles Avenue East, west of Victoria Park Avenue and east of Yonge Street, excluding the area within the old city of Toronto. In 1967, the riding was subdivided into three parts. The northern portion became the new riding of York Mills, the middle portion became the riding of Don Mills and the southern portion retained the name York East. Except for minor boundary changes, the riding stayed much the same until it was dissolved in 1999.

The bacteria metabolise hydrogen sulfide and methane produced by the seeps, and are harvested by the animals' comb-like mouthparts. Among the other deep-sea animals that make use of such symbionts this species is unique in that it actively waves its appendages over the vents in order to provide the bacteria with more oxygen and nutrients. Kiwa puravida was discovered living on the deep sea bottom off the coast of Costa Rica in 2006 by Andrew Thurber, William J. Jones and Kareen Schnabel. The only other members of its family, Kiwa hirsuta, and the Hoff crab, or Kiwa tyleri, are crabs with similarly hairy claws.

It is native to the les Saintes archipelago where it spread throughout the Lesser Antilles. The saintoise is an integral part of the heritage and the cultural identity of the archipelago. The practice of using sailing saintoises developed quickly in Guadeloupean water sports since 2001 when it officially became a new sport, the traditional sailboat racing. Description The traditional saintoise is constructed from several types of wood to create the hull (spruce for the keel, mahogany for the edges and the floor, Tabebuia pallida for members and bow). Sails (foresail and mainsail) are linked to the mast and the boom (in bamboo) by lianas called ailes de ravèt (literally: cockroach wings). The boom is longer than the mast. The boat is ballasted by rocks and is navigated by a crew of at least five persons, maintaining speed doing trapeze. Numerous shipyards exist today in les Saintes, Guadeloupe and la Désirade. Origin The traditional saintoise was created by ship carpenters from the Brittany province of France, who settled in les Saintes around the 18th century, and needed a small fishing boat. It is perfectly crafted to sail in the Caribbean Sea; its hollow and slender shape added to the jib and the mainsail allow it to efficiently navigate close-hauled. Upon the arrival of outboard motors in the 1960s, Alain Foy, a shipbuilder from Les Saintes, adapted the boat to the new technology and created the motor-driven saintoise. It spread rapidly among the fishermen of the Lesser Antilles, mainly in Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, la Désirade, Marie Galante, Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin where it replaced the unstable Gommier, a traditional dugout fishing boat. The hull became more stable and adapted to the weight of the engine. Today, hulls previously crafted in wood are made in composite materials as well. Water sports After a long time being mainly used for local regattas in the natural bay of Les Saintes, traditional saintoise sailboat racing became a popular sport in Guadeloupe and quickly became more democratic since the creation of the tour of Guadeloupe in Saintoise (T.G.V.T) in July, 2001. Its success has been growing each year. It has also become very popular in Saint-Barthélemy and les Saintes, where there are organized regattas during the Patron saint's day of these islands.

Adapted from Douglas Kennedy's 2007 novel of the same name, the film centers on a divorced American writer (Ethan Hawke) who moves to Paris to be closer to his young daughter. As he embarks on an affair with a mysterious widow (Kristin Scott Thomas), a dark force seems to be taking control of his life. Plot American writer Tom Ricks (Hawke) arrives in Paris to be closer to his young daughter who lives with his ex-wife. We learn that the divorce was caused by Tom's mental illness, from which he has apparently recovered. Completely broke, he accepts a job as a night guard for a local crime boss who owns a run down hostel. Stationed in a basement office, his only task is to push a button when a bell rings. The tranquility of the night, he hopes, will help him focus on his new novel. His days become more exciting when he starts a romance with Margit (Thomas), a mysterious and elegant widow who sets strange rules to their meetings: she will only see him at her apartment in the fifth arrondissement, at 5pm sharp, twice a week and he should ask no questions about her work or her past life. He also gets closer to Ania (Kulig), the Polish barmaid of the hostel where he lives, who has literary interests. Tom's relationship with Ania eventually becomes a sexual affair, and his neighbor blackmails him about it. Shortly after the neighbor is killed, his daughter goes missing, and Tom begins to believe that a dark force has entered his life, punishing anyone who has recently done him wrong. After the police accuse him of murdering his neighbor, Tom tries to use his weekly visits to Margit's apartment as an alibi. The police check and find out that she died and hasn't lived at this address for the past 15 years. He is let go, after the police determines that the murderer was in fact the owner of the hostel. When the two meet in the corridor of the police station, one is led to believe that somebody planted evidence to frame the owner of the hostel. He continues the affair with Ania, but also decides to encounter Margit again, and tells her she is not real. She says she is the most real love he'll encounter in his life, and that she knows him from the inside. She tells him to lose his muse and say goodbye to his wife and daughter. They embrace and he accuses her of having done something with his daughter, and he starts to choke her. His daughter is eventually found wandering in the forest, and is reunited with her mother. In the final scene, Ania waits for him at the bar but Tom ascends the stairs once again to Margit's apartment. The movie fades out as the door to her apartment opens . . .

To cover up the atrocity, the authorities condemn the lab. Eventually, when a bacterium found in the lab enters the sewer system, a squadron of soldiers is deployed to clean up the mess. Upon entering the lab via the sewers, the troops are slaughtered one at a time by Nezulla, whose armor-like skin easily deflect their bullets. Desperate to get through to the gunpowder room, a false safe explosive area, the commanding officer of the squadron bravely steps up to the creature, and forces a grenade into its mouth. Although his arm is ripped out at the limb portion, he is still able to escape before the creature explodes into thousands of pieces. Once the creature is finally dead, the remaining troops set the gunpowder on fire, and cause a chain explosion that destroys the lab, along with the bacteria.

The \\"Elch\\" (Moose) division managed to advance 44 miles in the first 34 hours of the campaign in the Baltic States, but after being assigned the mission of clearing the Baltic coast, was temporarily stopped in their tracks at the naval base of Libau where Soviet Marines and 67th Rifle Division repelled their first attempt to rush the town on 25 June. Resorting to point blank artillery fire, Herzog's men finally overran the town after four days of fierce street and house fighting and continued advancing up the Baltic Coast before reaching the Latvian capital of Riga which was already under attack from the East by Philipp Kleffel's 1. Infanterie Division, the following day.https://www.warhistoryonline.com/articles/in-their-own-words-german- veterans-of-wwii-by-rob-schafer.html After helping secure Estonia during July and August, the division was deployed on the right wing of XXXVIII Korps's ring around the Oranienbaum Bridgehead in early September and broke through the Soviet first line of defences around Leningrad at Popsha before turning north and taking Peterhof, on the Gulf of Finland, sealing in the Coastal Army. After this success, the front settled down into static positions that changed very little for almost two years, but, following his receiving the Knights Cross in mid-October, there was little time for Herzog and his men to catch their breath as they were shifted to 18th Armee's front along the Volkhov River to resist continued efforts by the Russians to break through to besieged Leningrad. The division was finally withdrawn from the front in late December, but only had a few days' rest before Andrei Vlassov's 2nd Shock Army launched a massive offensive at the beginning of January aimed at the thinly held line at the junction of 61. Infanterie Division and 21. Infanterie Division. 505th Inf. Regt., under Oberst Lohmeyer to seal the breach , but it was only a question of time before they made another probe elsewhere. \\"A matter of time\\" was ten days, the breathrough was slightly to the south, and it was the 291st that again stood in their way, but, despite atrocious weather, its men stood firm long enough for the Polizei and 58. Infanterie Division to cut off the Russian penetration, though fighting within the pocket went on until late June. After defeating the Soviet 2nd Shock Army's penetration of the front over the Volkhov River, and, despite the renewal of the offensive by the Russians in the Mga sector, just to the north of their positions, they were kept on the relatively quiet sector north of Novgorod until January 1943, when they were shifted to LIX Korps sector on the junction of Heeresgruppe Nord and Heeresgruppe Mitte. During that Winter the divisions three Infantry Regiments lost one battalion each, except for one company from each which was, initially, formed into a Ski battalion, but this unit was later converted to bicycles. Remaining in defensive positions around Korotsen over the Winter the division was reinforced by the recreation of 506th Gren. Regt. in February but was nearly annihilated by the Soviet 3rd Guards Tank Army near Shepetovka in early March. By June they were back on 4th Panzerarmee's front (XLII Korps) as they fell back through south-east Poland (also taking part in the fighting inside the Hube cauldron). The severely understrength Division rejoined XLII Korps in August and remained with them until over-run and destroyed by 1st Ukrainian Front near Czestochowa (Tschensotchau) after the Soviets resumed their offensive in mid-January 1945. Some remnants were incorporated into the 6. Infanterie Divisions 37th Gren. Regt. whilst the remainder were used to augment 17. Infanterie-Division in March.

This can lead to paralysis of the muscles innervated by the compressed nerve. Generally, crutches that are not adjusted to the correct height can cause the radial nerve to be constantly pushed against the humerus. This can cause any muscle that is innervated by the radial nerve to become partially or fully paralyzed. An example of this is wrist drop, in which the fingers, hand, or wrist is chronically in a flexed position because the radial nerve cannot innervate the extensor muscles due to paralysis. This condition, like other injuries from compressed nerves, normally improves quickly through therapy.A System of medicine, Volume 1 edited by Thomas Clifford AllbuttAnatomy Physiology - The Unity of Form and Function by Saladin 6th Edition  See also  * Brachial plexus injury  References   External links  * Category:Neurological disorders ","title":"Crutch paralysis"},{"id":"33948082","text":"The Stewart M-2 was an American all-metal, twin-engined, aerial survey aircraft.

The question is what would then happen to the earth and the other planets orbiting the sun. According to Isaac Newton's classical theory of gravity, the planets would immediately cease to move in circular motion, and inertia would make them start traveling in a straight line. Albert Einstein saw a deficiency in Newton's theory. The finiteness of the speed of light would mean that it would take a certain amount of time before the darkness from the sun's absence would reach the orbiting planet. Therefore, why would the planet instantaneously start traveling in a straight line before the arrival of information that the sun's disappearance has occurred? The cosmic catastrophe thought experiment led Einstein to the invention of the General Theory of Relativity and the creation of the concept of spacetime. Spacetime allowed Einstein to fix the deficiency in Newton's theory. In Einstein's spacetime model, the disappearance of the sun would create gravitational waves in the spacetime. The gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, and an orbiting planet would not react to the sun's disappearance until after the gravitational wave has reached it. Only then, the planet would start to travel in a straight line. External links *The elegant Universe, part 1 of a 3 part Nova mini-series (see details under the \\"transcript\\" tab).

It replaced the Chrysler VH Valiant and was a facelifted and revised version of that model. The VJ series Valiant was the tenth Chrysler Valiant model from Chrysler Australia. Overview The VJ Valiant models featured new grilles, round headlights and revised tail lights, along with improved trim and a larger range of colours. A new electronic ignition system was introduced on some models, the first time that this feature had been offered in an Australian built car.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 133 The total number of models offered was significantly reduced with Ranger XL, Hemi Pacer, Regal 770 and Charger R/T not carried across from the VH Valiant into the new series.

The town is unrelated to the Waretown that exists today in Ocean County, New Jersey. Origin Waretown was located at and around the crossroads of Williamstown and New Brooklyn Erial Roads, known today as “Mongan’s Corner”. Not much remains there today except Mongan's service station. Although Waretown was originally created in Gloucester Township and County, it became part of Camden County in 1844 when Camden was created from Gloucester. Then in 1845, the township was changed from Gloucester to Winslow when Winslow was carved out of Gloucester. Waretown was named for three Ware brothers who moved into and settled the area. They were John Jr., Jacob and George Ware. There was also a fourth brother, Joseph Ware, who also lived there with his family until his death in 1796. His son, Joseph O. Ware eventually took over his father's homestead and sold it to one of Jacob Ware's children. Their sister Patience Ware and her husband Paul H. Sears and family also moved there about 1794. All of the seven children of John Sr. and Sarah Marple Ware lived in Waretown during this time except for two of them who left New Jersey and migrated to Cincinnati, Ohio. Beginning in 1794, the offspring of these families were all born in Waretown.Records, birth, marriage, death, land and court, Gloucester County, New Jersey, in possession of author. Since they did not have their own cemetery, those who died in Waretown were usually buried in the Williamstown Old Methodist Church Cemetery, including John Ware, Jr., George Ware Sr., Patience Ware Sears and her husband Paul H. Sears, Rachel Ware Whitecar, Sarah Ware Ireland, and several others. The 1794 date comes from the John Ware Sr. land deed to his son George Ware and son-in-law Paul Sears. John Ware Sr. obtained the land sometime after 1784 and appears to have had considerable influence in his children settling in the Waretown area. The number of inhabitants of Waretown appear to have been quite numerous based on the number of children and grandchildren these 4 family members produced. However, shortly after 1810, many of the married and single children of John Ware Jr. began migrating westward. By 1830, eight of John Ware Jr.’s eleven children had migrated to one of four counties in the far southwest corner of Ohio which reduced the overall number of Waretown inhabitants.Documents, multiple migration data and source for the families who migrated to southwest Ohio, in possession of author. The children of George, Jacob and Patience continued living in Waretown although some of their family members also moved away. The three sons and one sister who were the original settlers of Waretown also began to pass away during the first half of the 1800s. According to death records in Gloucester County, John Jr. died in 1810; John Sr. died in 1819; Amy, the first wife of George Ware Sr. died in 1805; George died in 1828; George’s second wife, Naomi continued to live in Waretown until her death in 1868; Patience died in 1843 and her husband Paul followed her in 5 years; and Jacob and his wife died in 1861 and 1860 respectively. Sometime between 1790–1810, John Sickler (son of Christopher Zeigler, born in Germany) moved his family from Chews Landing, Gloucester County, New Jersey and settled one mile southwest of Waretown, at the present crossroads of Williamstown and Sicklerville Roads. John’s son William Tatem Sickler married Parnel Sears, daughter of Patience Ware Sears in Waretown in 1812 and their children were born and raised in Sicklertown. Both Waretown and Sicklertown existed a mile apart and were referred to by their own names. Today, some have erroneously referred to them as the same town. Decline As Waretown began to decrease in population during the first half of the 1800s, Sicklertown continued to grow. In 1851 the name Sicklertown was changed to Sicklerville. In 1874 a Post Office was opened in the store belonging to Paul Hammond Sickler (grandson of Patience Ware Sears) with him becoming its first Postmaster. Sometime after 1874 Waretown ceased to exist. Today, Sicklerville includes the areas once known as Sicklertown and Waretown.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Dalliconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

This corporation bribed Louisiana lawmakers to enable it to stay in business, and the firm amassed a considerable fortune over the years while Howard led a controversial life. He died at age 53 after a fall off of a carriage in Dobbs Ferry, New York, but his family continued his efforts at philanthropy and charitable giving. Howard was born in Baltimore and attended college in this city. He moved south, and worked as a newsdealer and then later as a lottery and policy dealer. When the Civil War broke out, Howard's business dealings were described as \\"obscure\\" according to a report in The New York Times. At a later point in his life, he claimed to have been a soldier for the confederate side for Tennessee, but this was subsequently disproven. In 1866, he was hired by the Kentucky lottery firm of C. H. Murray & Company to apply for a lottery charter in Louisiana from the state legislature. This effort failed, but after two years, a second attempt succeeded, partially as a result of bribery of key lawmakers in Louisiana. Howard was given $50,000 to apply for a charter and when the legislative grant came through, he refused to turn the charter over to his employers. A member of the firm of C. H. Murray & Co. named Marcus Cicero Stanley filed suit against Howard for being refused his \\"just share of the profits\\". The suit alleged that Howard had bribed a \\"large number of legislators\\" as well as an ex-Governor of Louisiana. But the lawsuit was dropped because it was decided that, given the nature of the gambling business, that the parties had no legal standing to enforce the contract. An advertisement for the Louisiana State Lottery drawing from 1887, showing schoolchildren who would benefit from the purchase of lottery tickets. The Louisiana Lottery Company gave Howard and his partners profits of 50%, and business began in January 1869. Howard used monies from the lottery to help win favor with the state legislature. In November, 1869, Louisiana Hose, one of 24 volunteer fire companies in New Orleans, having received a handsome new Amoskeag steamer, chose as the name for it that of “Annie Howard.” the daughter of Charles T. Howard, one of their former members and one of the best friends the Fire Department ever had. On the evening of November 26, 1869, having indicated to Mr. Howard their intention of naming their new machine in honor of his little daughter, the members responded to that gentleman's invitation to come to his house-then 699 Magazine St.- in order that he might add some features to the ceremony of the christening that he thought the members would regard as appropriate and agreeable. Consequently, the way from the engine house on First Street was illuminated with the glare of torches and enlivened with the strains of martial music, as the company with their new engine proceeded to the Howard residence. Upon arrival, the christening was at once proceeded with, Joseph P Horner, an exempt member of Louisiana Hose, making the address to the host of the evening. At the conclusion of his remarks he broke a bottle of wine over the engine and named her “Annie Howard”. Thereupon the youthful and charming original stepped forward to the edge of the veranda and presented to the company a handsome ribbon inscribed with the chosen name in letters of gold and green, indicative of hope and prosperity, and a wreath of flowers to crown the gift. With that the doors of the house were thrown open to the guests. A sequel to the story occurred five years later, in 1874. This was the christening of another new engine for Louisiana Hose company, the latest model Amoskeag which replaced the earlier unit. Five years of arduous service with the original engine had endeared the name and so it was resolved that the new engine would be christened with the same name. The evening commenced with a procession composed of members of the company as well as four representatives from each of the twenty four companies in the city, and many invited guests. It began on Carondelet St., in front of the engine house. First in the procession was a powerful calcium light, followed by a thirty six member band. Following the band were the guests and behind all were the 'Louisiana” boys with the new engine pulled by a team of four white caparisoned horses. Long rows of lights were borne on each side and in front of the line while the engine itself was illuminated by means of a girdle of gas jets which extended around the perimeter of the engine. Having marched through the principal streets of the Second district, the line of march then headed for the residence of Mr. Howard, then at 132 Prytania Street, arriving between nine and ten o'clock. Sky rockets and other fire works announced the procession. As the line halted in front of the residence, the band played the air, 'Gentle Annie” and then the gates were thrown open and the procession filled into the beautifully illuminated grounds. Within the house was gathered a large company of ladies and gentlemen. The whole number of persons directly participating in the christening was scarcely less than one thousand. After the christening, guests proceeded to a pavilion on the grounds capable of entertaining at table nearly 600 people at five long tables. It was indeed a grand banquet, worthy of the occasion, worthy of the known liberality of Mr. Howard and was intensely enjoyed by all. After the banquet, sparkling wine was introduced and Mr. R.H. Benners, the Foreman of Louisiana Hose, gave the first toast, pledging the health and happiness of Miss Annie Howard. The feasting and toasting continued until a late hour, when the company retired, satisfied with them selves, satisfied with their generous host, and fully persuaded that a private entertainment on so large a scale was never before been given in the Crescent City. Source: History of the Fire Department of New Orleans cc1895, pages 398, 401,402 Howard and his partners were adept at using money and influence to keep the lottery going and profitable. At one point, a state Constitutional Convention was about to be passed which would have outlawed the lottery, but \\"false pretenses, bribery and coercion\\" were used to ensure that any new constitution did not exclude the lottery. At one point, a Louisiana judge made some \\"extraneous remarks\\" which had \\"no legal value\\" which said that the new Louisiana Constitution had \\"legalized\\" the Louisiana Lottery, and Howard made sure not to appeal this decision. During its heyday, the firm divided about $2 million annually among stockholders, including Howard, as well as pay for the numerous bribes for public officials. Office of the Louisiana State Lottery Company in New Orleans, circa 1870s to 1880s. Howard built a beautiful house on St. Charles Street in New Orleans with a garden described as the \\"finest in the city.\\" He had a second home in Dobbs Ferry, a suburb of New York City. He acquired a reputation for giving generously to the city's charitable institutions. While he was a social climber, he did not respond kindly to snubs, and he \\"got even\\" with groups and organizations which had excluded him, such as the Metairie Jockey Club and the La Variétés Club, by waiting patiently, buying up the properties at propitious times, and casting out the snubbers. Howard was involved in controversy on several occasions. When a serious fever struck New Orleans in 1878, one report suggested that Howard has not contributed any monies to a relief effort. In 1879, he was arrested in New York City for starting lottery agencies to sell shares or tickets of the Louisiana State Lottery. A detective charged that he had been selling lottery tickets which had been against the laws of New York State at the time. There was no record of Howard having spent any time in jail, but he was reported to own an interest in a sugar plantation, own a \\"stud of horses\\", have financial interests in two New Orleans newspapers, and at one point aspired to the office of Governor of Louisiana. Postcard of the Howard Memorial Library in New Orleans, circa 1905. Howard died in a carriage accident in 1885 when he was thrown from the vehicle and severely injured. The name of Charles T. Howard will be remembered in the city of New Orleans as that of a good friend to so many deserving charities, individuals and enterprises that a list of them would fill a volume: for he was one of the most generous of men and the large fortune he amassed was ever at the disposal of the needy, Cut off by a sudden and accidental death in the prime of life, he left not only troops of friends, but many dependents to mourn his loss. Mr. Howard was borne in 1832. He attended college in the East, but came to the South in early manhood, embarking in business first in Mobile Alabama and then removing to New Orleans. Hardly had he begun life here than war broke out, and, true to the land of his adoption he entered the military service of the South, holding a commission in the Crescent Regiment. Upon his return to New Orleans at the end of the war he associated himself with others in the establishment of the Louisiana State Lottery Company, which from being at first a local soon became a national enterprise. He engaged in many enterprises of an industrial nature, and the considerable fortune that resulted from them he employed in doing good, and one of the most touching incidents at his funeral was the genuine mourning of those good sisters whom he had made almoners of his boundless charities. He took an active part in all that interested the leading spirits of the city, and was as public spirited in civic affairs and generous socially as he was benevolent in his dealings with the poor and needy. Vast public improvements were funded by him and in some instances were undertaken by him alone. He came to be a very conspicuous figure in New Orleans life in almost every line of activity. His death came at a time when his identification with prominent interests was fully established, and his loss was severely felt. It occurred on May 31, 1885, as a result of a fall from his horse while riding, at his Northern Home in Ingleside, near Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. His funeral, from his residence on St. Charles Ave. was attended by the leading citizens of New Orleans, by delegations from the John A. Mower Post, of the Army of Tennessee, Louisiana Hose Company, and many commercial institutions, and no less than four orphan asylums sent several hundred of their little charges to lay their humble offerings on the bier of one of whom one of the Sisters said, through her tears, “he was so good to the orphans.” The pall-bearers were Gen. G.T. Beauregard, Judge G.H. Braughn, L.C. Jurey, Judge Walter Rogers, Albert Baldwin, J.P. Horner, E. Belknap, J. O. Nixon and R.H. Benners. Mr. Howard was identified with the Fire Department by a long membership in Louisiana Hose Company, and at the time of his death the engine house of his company was handsomely draped in his memory. Source: History of the Fire Department of New Orleans cc 1895 Page 551 Howard's son, Frank T. Howard, continued in the lottery business and amassed fortunes, according to one account, with revenues of $4,000,000 a month reported, with about 60% of that being paid out in the form of prizes. Howard's daughter, Annie Howard, along with her brothers helped to build the Howard Memorial Library as well as the Louisiana Historical Annex, which has a collection of Confederate archives, including the private and state papers of southern president Jefferson Davis.

Unlike general powers of appointment, a special power of appointment is limited to a certain class of persons or entities that may receive the benefit of the power (appointee) from the person in whom the power is vested (donee). Generally, SPA trusts are used to hold property for asset protection purposes, because of the benefits and control a SPA trust offers over the assets protected within the trust. The purpose of a SPA Trust is to protect assets from a person's potential future liabilities by removing the assets from the person's legal ownership. A SPA Trust is created by a legal document which is prepared by an attorney who has expertise with debtor—creditor law, income tax law, gift and estate tax law, and trust law. The SPA Trust is built upon the following legal principles: 1\\\\. With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit.See Uniform Trust Code Section 505; RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TRUSTS Section 156(2) and RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TRUSTS Section 58(2). This principle has been adopted in hundreds of cases throughout the country and many states have enacted statutes with this identical language. See, e.g., Alabama Code Section 19-3B-505, Florida Trust Code Section 736.0505(b), Michigan Code Section 7506(c)(2), Ohio Code Section 5805.06, Utah Code Section 75-7-505(b), Virginia Code Section 55-545.05. 2\\\\. A settlor can retain a special power of appointment without subjecting the trust to the claims of creditors.RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF PROPERTY: WILLS AND OTHER DONATIVE TRANSFERS Section 22.1; US Bankruptcy Code Section 541(b)(1), California Probate Code Section 681; Delaware Code Section 3536; Georgia Code Section 23-2-111; New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law 10-7.1; See In Estate of German, 7 Cl.

By retaining a special power of appointment, the settlor should receive the following benefits: (1) The settlor can transfer unlimited amounts to the trust at any time without gift tax consequences, (2) the assets of the trust are entitled to a step-up in basis upon the settlor's death, (3) the settlor can pay the income taxes on the earnings of the trust and allow the trust to grow tax free, (4) the settlor can put a home in the trust and retain all the tax benefits of home ownership if the trust is a grantor trust, (5) the trust is eligible to own stock in an S corporation, and (6) the settlor can change the trustees, the beneficiaries, or the terms of the trust at any time. The SPA Trust is a sophisticated and highly technical legal agreement and its effectiveness in accomplishing any particular purpose will depend upon the expertise of those who create it and the circumstances of each particular case.

He had decreed that all suspected of conspiring in the acts of the expelled army should be put to death. It has been described as a genocide. The massacre, which took place throughout Haiti, occurred from early January 1804 until 22 April 1804, and resulted in the death of 3,000 to 5,000 people. Squads of soldiers moved from house to house, torturing and killing entire families. Throughout the early-to-mid nineteenth century, these events were well known in the United States. In addition, many refugees had come to the U.S. from Saint-Domingue, settling in New Orleans, Charleston, New York, Baltimore and other coastal cities. These events polarized Southern U.S. public opinion on the question of the abolition of slavery.Kevin C Julius, The Abolitionist Decade, 1829-1838: A Year-by-Year History of Early Events in the Antislavery Movement; MacFarland and Company; 2004Six Days in April: Lincoln and the Union in Peril; Frank B. Marcotte; Algora Publishing; 2004; page 171 Background Henri Christophe's personal secretary, who was a slave for much of his life, attempted to explain the incident by referencing the cruel treatment of black slaves by white slaveholders in Saint-Domingue: > Have they not hung up men with heads downward, drowned them in sacks, > crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars?

Haitian Revolution \\"Burning of the Plaine du Cap - Massacre of whites by the blacks.\\" On August 22, 1791, slaves set fire to plantations, torched cities and massacred the white population. In 1791, a man of Jamaican origin named Boukman became the leader of the enslaved Africans held on a large plantation in Cap-Français. In the wake of the French Revolution, he planned to massacre all the French living in Cap-Français. On 22 August 1791, the enslaved Africans descended to Le Cap, where they destroyed the plantations and executed all the French who lived in the region. King Louis XVI was accused of indifference to the massacre, while the slaves seemed to think the king was on their side. In July 1793, the French in Les Cayes were massacred. Despite the French proclamation of emancipation, the blacks sided with the Spanish who came to occupy the region. In July 1794, Spanish forces stood by while the black troops of Jean-François massacred the French whites in Fort- Dauphin. Philippe Girard writes that genocide was openly considered as a strategy by both sides in the conflict. White forces sent by Napoleon Bonaparte committed massacres but were defeated before they could accomplish genocide, while an army under Jean-Jacques Dessalines, composed mainly of former slaves, was able to wipe out the white Haitian population. Girard describes five main factors leading to the massacre, which he describes as a genocide: (1) Haitian soldiers were influenced by the French Revolution to justify murder and large-scale massacres on ideological grounds; (2) economic interests motivated French planters to want to quell the uprising, as well as influencing former slaves to want to kill the planters and take ownership of the plantations; (3) a slave revolt had been ongoing for more than a decade, and was itself a reaction to a century of brutal colonial rule, making violent death commonplace and therefore easier to accept; (4) the massacre was a form of class warfare in which former slaves were able to take revenge against their former masters; and (5) the last stages of the war became a racial conflict pitting Whites against Blacks and Mulattoes, in which racial hatred, dehumanization, and conspiracy theories all facilitated genocide. Dessalines came to power after France' defeat and subsequent evacuation from what was previously known as Saint-Domingue. In November 1803, three days after Rochambeau's forces surrendered, Dessalines ordered the execution of 800 French soldiers who had been left behind due to illness during the evacuation. He did guarantee the safety of the remaining white civilian population. However, Jeremy Popkin writes that statements by Dessalines such as \\"There are still French on the island, and still you considered yourselves free,\\" spoke of a hostile attitude toward the remaining white minority. Rumors about the white population suggested that they would try to leave the country to convince foreign powers to invade and reintroduce slavery. Discussions between Dessalines and his advisers openly suggested that the white population should be put to death for the sake of national security. Whites trying to leave Haiti were prevented from doing so. On 1 January 1804, Dessalines proclaimed Haiti an independent nation. Dessalines later gave the order to all cities on Haiti that all white men should be put to death. The weapons used should be silent weapons such as knives and bayonets rather than gunfire, so that the killing could be done more quietly, and avoid warning intended victims by the sound of gunfire and thereby giving them the opportunity to escape. According to Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James, the English government, via an agent, informed Dessalines that \\"the English would trade with San Domingo and accord their protection for its independence only when the last of the whites had fallen under the axe,\\" hoping to use the massacre to \\"drive a wedge between Haiti and France to break all possibilities of unity.\\" Massacre An 1806 engraving of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. It depicts the general, sword raised in one arm, while the other holds the severed head of a white woman. During February and March, Dessalines traveled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. Despite his orders, the massacres were often not carried out until he visited the cities in person. The course of the massacre showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited. Before his arrival, there were only a few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former white authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area's white population should be put into effect. Reportedly, he ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that the blame should not be placed solely on the black population. Mass killings took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. Eyewitness accounts of the massacre describe imprisonment and killings even of whites who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred. Women and children were generally killed last. White women were \\"often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death.\\" Dessalines did not specifically mention that the white women should be killed, and the soldiers were reportedly somewhat hesitant to do so. In the end, however, the women were also put to death, though normally at a later stage of the massacre than the adult males. The argument for killing the women was that whites would not truly be eradicated if the white women were spared to give birth to new Frenchmen. Before his departure from a city, Dessalines would proclaim an amnesty for all the whites who had survived in hiding during the massacre. When these people left their hiding place however, most (French) were killed as well. Many whites were, however, hidden and smuggled out to sea by foreigners. However, there were notable exceptions to the ordered killings. A contingent of Polish defectors were given amnesty and bestowed Haitian citizenship for their renouncement of French allegiance and support of Haitian independence. Dessalines referred to the Poles as \\"the White Negroes of Europe\\", as an expression of his solidarity and gratitude. In Port-au-Prince, only a few killings had occurred in the city despite the orders. After Dessalines arrived on 18 March, the number of killings escalated. According to a merchant captain, about 800 people were killed in the city, while about 50 survived. On 18 April 1804, Dessalines arrived at Cap-Haïtien. Only a handful of killings had taken place there before his arrival, but the killings escalated to a massacre on the streets and outside the city after his arrival. As elsewhere, the majority of the women were initially not killed. Dessalines's advisers, however, pointed out that the white Haitians would not disappear if the women were left to give birth to white men, and after this, Dessalines ordered that the women should be killed as well, with the exception of those who agreed to marry non-white men. Sources created at the time stated that 3,000 people were killed in Cap-Haïtien; Philippe Girard writes that this figure was unrealistic as in the post-evacuation of the French people the settlement had only 1,700 white people. One of the most notorious of the massacre participants was Jean Zombi, a mulatto resident of Port-au-Prince who was known for his brutality. One account describes how Zombi stopped a white man on the street, stripped him naked, and took him to the stair of the Presidential Palace, where he killed him with a dagger. Dessalines was reportedly among the spectators; he was said to be \\"horrified\\" by the episode. In Haitian Vodou tradition, the figure of Jean Zombi has become a prototype for the zombie. Aftermath By the end of April 1804, some 3,000 to 5,000 people had been killed and the white Haitians were practically eradicated, excluding a select group of whites who were given amnesty. The spared consisted of the Polish ex-soldiers who were given Haitian citizenship; a small group of German colonists invited to the north-west region before the revolution; and a group of medical doctors and professionals. Reportedly, also people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men. Dessalines did not try to hide the massacre from the world. In an official proclamation of 8 April 1804, he stated, \\"We have given these true cannibals war for war, crime for crime, outrage for outrage. Yes, I have saved my country, I have avenged America.\\" He referred to the massacre as an act of national authority. Dessalines regarded the elimination of the white Haitians an act of political necessity, as they were regarded as a threat to the peace between the black and the free people of color. It was also regarded as a necessary act of vengeance. Dessalines' secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated, \\"For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!\\"Independent Haiti, Library of Congress Country Studies. Dessalines was eager to assure that Haiti was not a threat to other nations. He directed efforts to establish friendly relations also to nations where slavery was still allowed. In the 1805 constitution, all citizens were defined as \\"black\\". The constitution also banned white men from owning land, except for people already born or born in the future to white women who were naturalized as Haitian citizens and the Germans and Poles who got Haitian citizenship. The massacre had a long-lasting effect on the view of the Haitian Revolution. It helped to create a legacy of racial hostility in Haitian society. Girard writes in the book Paradise Lost that \\"Despite all of Dessalines' efforts at rationalization, the massacres were as inexcusable as they were foolish.\\"Girard, Phillippe R. \\"Missed Opportunities: Haiti after Independence (1804–1915).\\" Paradise Lost. In: pp. 55-75. CITED: p. 56. Effect on American society At the time of the U.S. Civil War, a major pretext for southern whites, most of whom did not own slaves, to support slave-owners (and ultimately fight for the Confederacy) was fear of a genocide similar to the Haitian Massacre of 1804. This was explicitly referred to in Confederate discourse as a reason for secession.Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South; Stephanie McCurry; pages 12-13 The slave revolt was a prominent theme in the discourse of southern political leaders and had influenced U.S. public opinion since the events took place. Kevin C. Julius writes: In the run-up to the U.S. presidential election of 1860, Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote \\"I remember the horrors of St. Domingo\\" and said that the election \\"will determine whether anything like this is to be visited upon our own southern countrymen.\\" Abolitionists recognized the strength of this argument on public opinion in both the north and south. In correspondence to the New York Times in September 1861 (during the war), an abolitionist named J.B. Lyon addressed this as a prominent argument of his opponents: Lyon argued, however, that the abolition of slavery in the various Caribbean colonies of the European empires before the 1860s showed that an end to slavery could be achieved peacefully. Philippe Girard writes \\"when the genocide was over, Haiti's white population was virtually non-existent.\\" Citing Girard, Nicholas A. Robins and Adam Jones describe the massacre as a \\"genocide of the subaltern\\" in which a previously disadvantaged group used a genocide to destroy their previous oppressors.

Stated another way, biomarkers of aging would give the true \\"biological age\\", which may be different from the chronological age. Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to extend lifespan, because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism. Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time. Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of aging and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism. An assemblage of biomarker data for an organism could be termed its \\"ageotype\\". Although graying of hair increases with age, hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice. Advances in big data analysis allowed for the new types of \\"aging clocks\\" to be developed. The epigenetic clock is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. Further studies of the hematological clock on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality. It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the transcriptomic clock. The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. Consequently, modern deep machine learning techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the NHANES study).  Epigenetic marks   Loss of histones  A new epigenetic mark found in studies of aging cells is the loss of histones. Most of the evidence shows that loss of histones is linked to cell division. In aging and dividing yeast MNase-seq (Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing) showed a loss of nucleosomes of ~50%. Proper histone dosage is important in yeast as shown from the extended lifespans seen in strains that are overexpressing histones. A consequence of histone loss in yeast is the amplification of transcription. In younger cells, genes that are most induced with age have specific chromatin structures, such as fuzzy nuclear positioning, lack of a nuclesome depleted region (NDR) at the promoter, weak chromatin phasing, a higher frequency of TATA elements, and higher occupancy of repressive chromatin factors. In older cells, however, the same genes nucleosome loss at the promoter is more prevalent which leads to higher transcription of these genes. This phenomenon is not only seen in yeast, but has also been seen in aging worms, during aging of human diploid primary fibroblasts, and in senescent human cells. In human primary fibroblasts, reduced synthesis of new histones was seen to be a consequence of shortened telomeres that activate the DNA damage response. Loss of core histones may be a general epigenetic mark of aging across many organisms.  Histone variants  In addition to the core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, there are other versions of the histone proteins that can be significantly different in their sequence and are important for regulating chromatin dynamics. Histone H3.3 is a variant of histone H3 that is incorporated into the genome independent of replication. It is the major form of histone H3 seen in the chromatin of senescent human cells, and it appears that excess H3.3 can drive senescence. There are multiple variants of histone 2, the one most notably implicated in aging is macroH2A. The function of macroH2A has generally been assumed to be transcriptional silencing; most recently, it has been suggested that macroH2A is important in repressing transcription at Senescence-Associated Heterochromatin Foci (SAHF). Chromatin that contains macroH2A is impervious to ATP-dependent remodeling proteins and to the binding of transcription factors.  Histone modifications  Increased acetylation of histones contributes to chromatin taking a more euchromatic state as an organism ages, similar to the increased transcription seen due to the loss of histones. There is also a reduction in the levels of H3K56ac during aging and an increase in the levels of H4K16ac. Increased H4K16ac in old yeast cells is associated with the decline in levels of the HDAC Sir2, which can increase the life span when overexpressed. Methylation of histones has been tied to life span regulation in many organisms, specifically H3K4me3, an activating mark, and H4K27me3, a repressing mark. In C. elegans, the loss of any of the three Trithorax proteins that catalyze the trimethylation of H3K4 such as, WDR-5 and the methyltransferases SET-2 and ASH-2, lowers the levels of H3K4me3 and increases lifespan. Loss of the enzyme that demethylates H3K4me3, RB-2, increases H3K4me3 levels in C. elegans and decreases their life spans. In the rhesus macaque brain prefrontal cortex, H3K4me2 increases at promoters and enhancers during postnatal development and aging. These increases reflect progressively more active and transcriptionally accessible (or open) chromatin structures that are often associated with stress responses such as the DNA damage response. These changes may form an epigenetic memory of stresses and damages experienced by the organism as it develops and ages. UTX-1, a H3K27me3 demethylase, plays a critical role in the aging of C.elegans: increased utx-1 expression correlates with a decrease in H3K27me3 and a decrease in lifespan. Utx-1 knockdowns showed an increase in lifespan Changes in H3K27me3 levels also have affects on aging cells in Drosophila and humans.  DNA methylation  Methylation of DNA is a common modification in mammalian cells. The cytosine base is methylated and becomes 5-methylcytosine, most often when in the CpG context. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is associated with transcriptional repression and hypomethylation of these sites is associated with transcriptional activation. Many studies have shown that there is a loss of DNA methylation during ageing in many species such as, rats, mice, cows, hamsters, and humans. It has also been shown that DNMT1 and DNMT3a decrease with aging and DNMT3b increases. Hypomethylation of DNA can lower genomic stability, induce the reactivation of transposable elements, and cause the loss of imprinting, all of which can contribute to cancer progression and pathogenesis.  Immune Biomarkers  Recent data suggests that an increased frequency of senescent CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood is associated with the development of hyperglycemia from a pre-diabetic state suggestive of senescence playing a role in metabolic aging. Senescent Cd8+ T cells could be utilized as a biomarker to signal the transition from pre-diabetes to overt hyperglycemia. Recently, Hashimoto and coworkers profiled thousands of circulating immune cells from supercentenarians at single-cell resolution. They identified a very unique increase in cytotoxic CD4 T cells in these supercentenarians. Generally, CD4 T-cells have helper, but not cytotoxic, functions under physiological conditions however these supercentenarians, subjected to single cell profiling of their T-cell receptors, revealed accumulations of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells through clonal expansion. The conversion of helper CD4 T-cells to a cytotoxic variety might be an adaptation to the late stage of aging aiding in the fighting infections and potentially enhancing tumor surveillance.  Applications of Aging Biomarkers  The main mechanisms identified as potential biomarkers of aging are DNA methylation, loss of histones, and histone modification. The uses for biomarkers of aging are ubiquitous and identifying a physical parameter of biological aging would allow humans to determine our true age, mortality, and morbidity. The change in the physical biomarker should be proportional to the change in the age of the species. Thus after establishing a biomarker of aging, humans would be able to dive into research on extending life spans and finding timelines for the arise of potential genetic diseases. One of the applications of this finding would allow for identification of the biological age of a person. DNA methylation uses the structure of dna at different stages of life to determine an age. DNA methylation is the methylation of the cysteine in the CG or Cpg region. The hypermethylation of this region is associated with decreased transcriptional activity and the opposite for hypomethylation. In other words, the more \\"tightly\\" held the DNA region then the more stable and \\"younger\\" the species. Looking at DNA methylation's properties in tissues, it was found to be almost zero for embryonic tissues, it can be used to determine acceleration of age and the results can be reproduced in chimpanzee tissue.

About Royal Tropical Institute  KIT Royal Tropical Institute is an independent centre of expertise and education for sustainable development. KIT assists governments, NGOs and private corporations around the world to build inclusive and sustainable societies, informing best practices and measuring their impact. Guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, KIT's work focuses on health care, gender, economic development and intercultural cooperation. KIT's campus in Amsterdam houses a training centre for students and professionals. It is also the home of SDG House: a community of sustainability experts and social entrepreneurs with a membership of 50+ organisations. KIT owns and operates Amsterdam Tropen Hotel,https://amsterdamtropenhotel.com/en/home/ De Tropen café-restaurant,https://amsterdamdetropen.nl/ and offers office and conference facilities in its landmark building, the revenues of which contribute to KIT’s mission. History The institute's history dates to 1864, when it began in Haarlem as the Colonial Museum, founded to house the collection of artefacts brought back from the Dutch colonies in the East (esp. Dutch East India) by Frederik Willem van Eeden (amateur botanist). Specifically, its collection consisted of anthropological and cultural artefacts and products from the East Indian archipelago. From 1871 the museum also performed research aimed at enhancing the production and processing of tropical products such as coffee beans, rattan and paraffin. Dutch trade in Indonesia led to increased public interest in ethnology and in the way of life of people of the Tropics – and their welfare. Around the turn of the 20th century the size of collection and related research together with growth in visitor numbers led the museum to team up with an Association (‘Vereeniging Koloniaal Instituut’) that set about establishing a more ambitious Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. In 1910, the Colonial Institute was founded in Amsterdam. It was founded by the Ministry of the Colonies, the City of Amsterdam, the Artis Royal Zoo, and prominent businesses active in the Dutch colonies. Its members subsequently contributed funds for a new building to be located on the former Eastern Cemetery of Amsterdam. Three designs were tendered and the building commission chose that of J.J. van Nieukerken , who did not live to see out his work, which was completed by his sons M.A. and J. Van Nieukerken. Construction began in 1915. Materials were hard to find and expensive due to the outbreak of the First World War, and this caused long delays. Strikes, storm damage and harsh winters also led to delays. It took a total of 11 years to complete construction.  Building Design  The complex was built in the neo- renaissance style using one colour for the bricks and one type of natural stone for the finish. The main building, housing the primary entrance and professional departments, is located on the Mauritskade side. A low building with the shape of a semicircle connects the two buildings. At the corner of the Linnaeusstraat and Mauritskade is a large bell tower. Imposing features include the octagonal Marble Hall, the large Auditorium, and the museum’s Hall of Light.  1926-1949  On the 9th of October 1926, Queen Wilhelmina opened the complex. Since that time, KIT has been housed in this historic, neo-renaissance building at the edge of the Oosterpark. The building has been designated as a national monument. In 1931 it hosted the World Social Economic Conference organised by the International Institute of Industrial Relations. During World War II, the German occupying forces housed the Grüne Polizei in the institute; at the same time, owing to the complicated architecture of the building (at one time the largest building in the city), the institute was a hotbed of resistance—it housed weapons and radios, and even Dutchmen hiding from the Germans: the grandson of Hendrikus Colijn, resistance fighter Hendrik Colijn, worked there under the alias Colijn, and when the building was searched by the Germans in 1944 he escaped through the labyrinthine passages in the attic.  1950-present day  In 1950, after Dutch decolonization, the institute's mission changed. The process of Dutch decolonialisation went hand in hand with an evolution of its mission and vision. KIT’s activities were no longer confined to the Netherlands’ former overseas territories and in 1952 a new name was adopted: the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT – Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen). In the ensuing decades KIT grew into an association of scientists dedicated to international cooperation, intercultural understanding and the practical application of scientific knowledge for socio- economic development and health care amongst the diverse collection of newly independent nations that emerged in the post-colonial era. As of May 2012, the institute's annual budget was over €40 million. In 2011 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands) had announced it would cease its €20 million annual subsidy, a decision appealed by the institute to the Dutch Council of State. As a result of the Dutch government's withholding of subsidy, the entire collection of books and magazines (the Tropenbibliotheek) was moved. Parts of the collection were given to different institutions in the Netherlands, the so-called heritage collection and the colonial and modern map collections were placed at Leiden University Libraries. In October 2013 the Bibliotheca Alexandrina announced it would take in some 400,000 books and 20,000 magazines that otherwise would have been destroyed. In 2014 the Tropenmuseum became independent and merged with other Dutch Ethnographic Museums. In 2017, KIT launched SDG House,https://www.sdghouse.org/ which is home to more than 50 organisations. It acts as a catalyst for sustainability initiatives: a place to meet, exchange ideas, identify synergies, and build enduring partnerships.

Playing as a full-back, Hofmeyr appeared in three of England's four Tests in the 1950 Five Nations Championship, against Wales, France and Scotland. He played his club rugby for Harlequins and also represented the Barbarians. He captained the Oxford University Cricket Club in the 1951 season and then returned to South Africa. In the 1951/52 and 1952/53 Currie Cup competition, Hofmeyr was captain of North Eastern Transvaal and played a total of nine first-class matches, from which he made 683 runs at 48.78.

The church is said to have been the \\"Mother Church of Huntingdon\\". It occupies what is probably the original site of Huntingdon Priory of Austin Canons, founded in 1140 by Eustace de Lovetot, and seems to have been used initially as a parochial church upon the removal of the priory to the east end of town during the reign of Henry II. In July 1607, the building fell down, and construction of the present church commenced in March of the following year and finished in 1620. The church's organ chamber and vestry were built later in 1869, and further restorations were carried out in 1876. It was listed as a Grade I building in January 1951. Architecture and fittings The church consists of chancel, cloistered nave, aisles, south porch and a western tower, of Perpendicular Gothic era. Crocketed pinnacles and buttresses are enriched with panelling and niches. The nave is divided from the aisles by four arches on each side, supported by round and octagonal columns. Some of the piers, as well as the chancel, exhibit portions of Early English Period and Decorated Gothic work. There is a stone pulpit, the gift of John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich. The font is Early English, with a plain octagonal bowl, resting on clustered shafts. The whole building was restored in 1876, adding open oak seats and a new triplet east window (the latter a gift from Gerald Vesey, Archdeacon of Huntingdon) and installing its present eight bells (presented by M. E. Maill). This was under the direction of Reginald Blomfield and was completed at a cost, exclusive of special gifts, of over £2,000. There is a monument to the family of De Carcassonett, erected in 1749, and one erected by the officers of the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment, to the memory of their comrades who fell in the Crimean War. The church has seats for 550 persons. The earliest entry in the register of St. Mary's dates from the year 1593. References * This article includes text incorporated from E.R.

Advancing units fire their weapons without stopping to aim, in an attempt to pin down enemy defenders. Marching fire usually ends with an infantry charge to engage the enemy in close combat. The tactic requires ample ammunition and rapid-fire weapons. It differs from fire and movement in that the attacking force advances in unison rather than leapfrogging forward in alternating groups. An early form of marching fire was used with little success by Prussian troops at the end of the 18th century, then victoriously in the 1866 Battle of Königgrätz because of the fast-firing Dreyse needle gun. The modern form of marching fire evolved in the early 20th century from a French Army infantry assault concept which suggested the use of suppressive fire from a light machine gun carried by one man—the Chauchat automatic rifle. The tactic was employed to a limited degree in World War I then further codified with the introduction of the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and described in U.S. small unit infantry tactics manuals in the early 1920s. As a combined arms stratagem, the tactic was prominently advocated and utilized by General George S. Patton in World War II during his command of the Third Army. Infantry alone may be insufficient to suppress a well-positioned, well-armed and resolute enemy, especially during the final charge phase. To augment marching fire, supporting forces including heavy weapons teams and armored units may be halted in static positions to maintain suppressive fire throughout the final charge of friendly troops. History The French military tactician Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, wrote dismissively about a Prussian tactic he called \\"marching fire\\". In the late 18th century he witnessed a Prussian Army maneuver in which advancing troops formed themselves into a battle line of two ranks. In alternating fashion, one rank fired their weapons at a slow march while the other group reloaded then advanced on the double. The Prussians called this tactic \\"fire in advancing\\" (Feuer im Vormarsch) and trained in it at the level of platoon, company and battalion. Guibert considered it \\"ill advised\\", with the line's progress across the field seen as too slow, exposing the troops for too long to defensive fire. Dreyse needle gun The first successful employment of marching fire may be traced to the fast-firing Dreyse needle gun used by Prussian troops in the mid-19th century. This new breech-loading gun was 2–3 times faster than contemporary muzzle- loading guns, and its lightweight cartridge allowed the infantryman to carry more ammunition. A major disadvantage was that escaping hot gases from the breech would strike the face of any trooper who took careful aim. Accordingly, the weapon was often fired while being held away from the face with the result that marksmanship was inferior. In 1866, Prussians were successful in advancing quickly while firing their needle guns in the Battle of Königgrätz; the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. Soon, though, the increased use of rapid-fire guns by defending troops neutralized the advantage. 20th century A British soldier demonstrates proper marching fire technique using a Thompson submachine gun with a 50-round drum magazine In 1903, French military theorists noticed that the machine guns of the day, heavy and relatively immobile, were of little use in infantry assaults. They determined that \\"the machine gun must learn to walk\\". A marching fire tactic (French: feu de marche) was expected to involve incidental suppressive fire, with the advancing troops considered a deadlier threat than the unaimed bullets, causing the enemy to fall back. The prototype guns were not approved for production, and none were in service when World War I began. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype ( the \\"CS\\" for Chauchat and Sutter ) into the lightweight Chauchat M1915 automatic rifle with a high rate of fire. The French Army was equipped with it, and the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon was prone to jamming and overheating. Seeing the potential of such a gun, the British Army settled upon the American-designed Lewis gun fitted for a round; infantry platoons provided with the guns were instructed in fire and movement tactics. Soon, the gun was seen to be useful in marching fire assaults, notably by the Australian Corps in the July 1918 Battle of Hamel. To serve the same purpose, the German Army adopted the MG08/15 which was impractically heavy at counting the water for cooling and one magazine holding 100 rounds. In 1918 the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was introduced in the US Army, and with the weapon came new field tactics including marching fire. The BAR's shoulder sling was to be adjusted in length to allow the butt of the weapon to be held firmly at the side of the torso just above the hips, with one hand at the trigger and the other hand aiming. A recommended rate of fire was one round per footstep, with eyes kept on the target and the weapon aimed low at first. The tactic was to be employed under conditions of limited field of fire and poor visibility such as advancing through woods. That same year the U.S. Navy instructed its landing forces (usually Marines) that marching fire with a BAR was to be used in very limited circumstances, such as when the enemy line was clearly defined and the range was less than . Marching fire was not usually employed in the open and was more appropriate in dense woods. The Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) handbook of 1921 included a description of marching fire as an assault tactic in which the BAR men walk and shoot from the hip with the weapon's weight supported on a shoulder sling, but the accompanying riflemen were expected to halt and carefully aim each of their shots, firing from the shoulder, from a standing or kneeling position. The psychological value of marching fire was quickly recognized. Marching fire was seen as a boost to the morale of the assault troops. It was hoped that enemy troops would lose courage if they heard bullets flying around them, if they believed that their position was known to the attackers. World War II General George S. Patton in 1943 The tactic of marching fire was praised by General George S. Patton for three reasons: friendly forces using the tactic continued to advance rather than get bogged down, the positive action of shooting provided self-confidence to the soldier, and the enemy's defensive fire was reduced in accuracy, volume and effectiveness. First published in 1947. Patton recommended that the rifleman carrying \\"that magnificent weapon\\", the M1 Garand rifle, should fire his weapon every two or three paces, holding the weapon at his shoulder if desired, but a lower position between the belt and armpit was \\"just as effective\\". Patton advised his 81 mm M1 mortar teams to stay in one place during the assault and apply steady fire, but his smaller 60 mm M2 mortars should alternately fire and leapfrog forward. Light machine guns could be simultaneously carried and fired by one man while another man fed the ammo belt. Patton wrote that the main purpose of the tank was to attack infantry in defensive positions rather than other tanks. He instructed his tanks and other armored units to advance with marching fire in support of the infantry. Australian troops advance against a Japanese pillbox in 1943, supported by an M3 Stuart tank General William E. DePuy, who rose from junior staff officer to battalion commander in the 90th Infantry Division between 1942 and 1945, evaluated the efficacy of unsupported marching fire and found it lacking. Writing after the war, DePuy said that marching fire became a fad, in some American units almost the sole form of attack. DePuy noted that when it was employed against Germans who were \\"well hidden and in very good positions\\"—as they usually were—the attackers walked into the enemy's kill zone. DePuy said that if maneuvering infantry alone performed marching fire, the moment when enemy suppression was most needed it would cease during the final charge at which time \\"the enemy then comes up out of his foxholes and starts to fire at you.\\" DePuy asserted that suppression gained by fire from non-moving units was critical to the success of marching fire. Such units could be as large as rifle companies or as small as squads equipped with heavy and light machine guns.

The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the telephone, and the first electric hearing aid was created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing aid was distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear. The invention of the carbon microphone, transmitters, digital signal processing chip or DSP, and the development of computer technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form. Ear trumpet Frederick Rein's ingenious acoustic chair, designed for King John VI of Portugal in the early 19th-century. The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf, dates back to the 17th century. By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the deaf educator John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter Joshua Reynolds) and the Daubeney Trumpet. The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. As well as producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold hearing fans, and speaking tubes. These instruments helped amplify sounds, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held ear trumpets and cones were used as hearing aids.Levitt, H. \\"Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts.\\" ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.Mills, Mara. \\"Hearing Aids and the History of Electronics Miniaturization.\\" IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 33.2 (2011): 24-44. Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th century designs. Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King John VI of Portugal in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear. Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear. Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' Aurolese Phones were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would amplify the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem. Electronic hearing aids A 1933 ad for early vacuum tube hearing aids. These German hearing aids date from around 1920 to 1950. They include an attachment similar to a telephone receiver. Museum of Medicine, Berlin, Germany. The first electronic hearing aids were constructed after the invention of the telephone and microphone in the 1870s and 1880s. The technology within the telephone increased how acoustic signal could be altered. Telephones were able to control the loudness, frequency, and distortion of sounds. These abilities were used in the creation of the hearing aid. The first electric hearing aid, called the Akouphone, was created by Miller Reese Hutchison in 1898. It used a carbon transmitter, so that the hearing aid could be portable. The carbon transmitter was used to amplify sound by taking a weak signal and using electric current to make it a strong signal. These electronic hearing aids could eventually be shrunk into purses and other accessories. One of the first manufacturers of the electronically amplified hearing aid was the Siemens company in 1913. Their hearing aids were bulky and not easily portable. They were about the size of a \\"tall cigar box\\" and had a speaker that would fit in the ear. The first vacuum-tube hearing aid was patented by a Naval engineer Earl Hanson in 1920. It was called the Vactuphone and used the telephone transmitter to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried. Marconi in England and Western Electric in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, the vacuum tube hearing aid became more successful and began to decrease in size with better miniaturization techniques. The Acousticon's Model 56 was created in the mid-1920s and was one of the first portable hearing aid units, although it was quite heavy. The first wearable hearing aid using vacuum tube technology went on sale in England in 1936, and a year later in the United States. By the 1930s, hearing aids were becoming popular to the public. Multitone of London patented the first hearing aid to use automatic gain control. The same company introduced a wearable version in 1948. Military technological advances that occurred in World War II helped the development of hearing aids. One of the major advances that World War II enabled was the idea of miniaturization. This could be seen by Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75. Transistor hearing aids This early 1980s photo shows a hearing aid with a transistor that is worn over the chest with shoulder straps. It would sometimes have a problem with static interference, even if the wearer laughed or smiled. The development of transistors in 1948 by Bell Laboratories led to major improvements to the hearing aid. The transistor was invented by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less distortion and heat than their predecessor. These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement. The 1952 Sonotone 1010 used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life. The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, carbon microphones. These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses. In 1951, Raytheon manufactured the transistor and was one of the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids. The act of putting transistors into hearing aids was so quick that they were not properly tested. It was later found that transistors could get damp. Because of this dampness, the hearing aid would only last for a few weeks and then die. In order to stop this from happening, a coating had to be put on the transistor to protect it from the dampness. This problem had to be fixed in order for transistors in hearing aids to be successful. Zenith was the first company to realize the problem with transistors was the body heat of individuals. After coming to this conclusion, the first \\"all-transistor\\" hearing aids were offered in 1952, called the Microtone Transimatic and the Maico Transist-ear. In 1954, the company, Texas Instruments, produced a silicon transistor, which was much more effective than the previous version. The end of the transistor was marked by the creation of the integrated circuit or IC by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the technique was perfected in hearing aids over the next 20 years. Elmer V. Carlson, the author of thirty patents, was instrumental in inventing many of the components of the modern hearing aid.http://www.etymotic.com/media/publications/erl-0114-1992.pdf Digital hearing aid Beginning in the early 1960s, Bell Telephone Laboratories created digital processing for creating both speech and audio signals on a large mainframe computer. Because of the slow processing ability of these large digital computers of the era, the process of simulating hearing aids was extremely slow. The processing of the audio speech signal took longer than the length of the duration of the speech signal itself preventing the processing of speech in real time. This made it nearly impossible to conceive the idea that a self-contained, wearable digital hearing aid could be made small enough to fit onto an ear like a conventional analog hearing aid. However, this digital processing research was important for learning about how to develop sounds for those with hearing disabilities. In the 1970s, the microprocessor was created. This microprocessor helped to open up the door to miniaturization of the digital hearing aid. Moreover, researcher Edgar Villchur developed an analog multi-channel amplitude compression device with amplitude compression that enabled the audio signal to be separated into frequency bands. These frequency bands were able to adjust the analog sound non-linearly so that loud sounds could be less amplified and weak sounds could become more amplified. The system of multi-channel amplitude compression would be later used as the fundamental structural design for the first hearing aids that used digital technology. Also in the 1970s the creation of a hybrid hearing aid was possible in which the analog components of a conventional hearing aid consisting of amplifiers, filters and signal limiting were combined with a separate digital programmable component into a conventional hearing aid case. The audio processing remained analog but was able to be controlled by the digital programmable component. The digital component could be programmed by connecting the device to an external computer in the laboratory then disconnected to allow the hybrid device to function as a conventional wearable hearing aid. The hybrid device was effective from a practical point of view because of the low power consumption and compact size. At that time, low-power analog amplifier technology was well developed in contrast to the available semiconductor chips able to process audio in real time. The combination of high performance analog components for real time audio processing and a separate low power digital programmable component only for controlling the analog signal led to the creation several low power digital programmable components able to implement different types of digital control of analog circuits. A hybrid hearing aid was developed by Etymotic Design. A little later, Mangold and Lane created a programmable multi-channel hybrid hearing aid. Graupe with co-authors developed a digital programmable component that implemented an adaptive noise filter that could be added to a hybrid hearing aid. The creation of high-speed digital-array processors used in minicomputers opened up the door for advances in full digital hearing aids. These minicomputers were able to process audio signals at speeds that were equivalent to real-time. In 1982, at the City University of New York, a real- time full digital experimental hearing aid was created based on the digital array processor in an external, standalone minicomputer and an FM radio transmitter that allowed a wireless connection between the minicomputer and individual wearing a transmitter on the body. The FM transmitter on the body was connected by a wire to an ear microphone and loudspeaker. Technically this was a wearable hearing aid though it was not self contained and the range the user could use it was limited by the range of the wireless connection and the external minicomputer was extremely heavy and nearly impossible to move Oticon hearing aids to be used with Bluetooth wireless devices. preventing it from being used as conventional hearing aid in real world environments. However, this was a major breakthrough in the creation of a full digital hearing aid. Also in the early 1980s a research group at Central Institute for the Deaf headed up by faculty members at Washington University in St. Louis MO created the first full digital wearable hearing aid.Engebretson, AM, Popelka, GR, Morley, RE, Niemoeller, AF, and Heidbreder, AF: A digital hearing aid and computer-based fitting procedure. Hearing Instruments 1986; 37(2): 8-14Popelka, GR: Computer assisted hearing aid fitting, in Microcomputer Applications in Rehabilitation of Communication Disorders, M.L. Grossfeld and C.A. Grossfeld, Editors. 1986, Aspen Publishing: Rockville, Maryland. 67-95 They first conceived a complete, comprehensive full digital hearing aid, then designed and fabricated, miniaturized full digital computer chips using custom digital signal processing chips with low power and very large scale integrated (VLSI) chip technology able to process both the audio signal in real time and the control signals yet able to be powered by a battery and be fully wearable as a full digital wearable hearing aid able to be actually used by individuals with hearing loss in any environment similar to a conventional hearing aid. Engebretson, Morley and Popelka were the inventors of the first full digital hearing aid. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, \\"Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods\\" by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984 and issued in 1985. This full digital wearable hearing aid also included many additional features now used in all contemporary full digital hearing aids including a bidirectional interface with an external computer, self-calibration, self-adjustment, wide bandwidth, digital programmability, a fitting algorithm based on audibility, internal storage of digital programs, and fully digital multichannel amplitude compression and output limiting. This group created several of these full digital hearing aids and used them for research on hearing impaired people as they wore them in the same manner as conventional hearing aids in real-world situations. In this first full DHA all stages of sound processing and control were carried out in binary form. The external sound from microphones positioned in an ear module identical to a BTE was first converted into binary code, then digitally processed and digitally controlled in real time, then converted back to an analog signal sent to miniature loudspeakers positioned in the same BTE ear module. These specialized hearing aid chips continued to become smaller, increase in computational ability and require even less power. Now, virtually all commercial hearing aids are fully digital and their digital signal processing capability has significantly increased. Very small and very low power specialized digital hearing aid chips are now used in all hearing aids manufactured worldwide. Many additional new features also have been added with various on-board advanced wireless technology.Popelka, GR., Moore, BJC, Popper, AN, and Fay, RR: 2016, Hearing Aids, Springer Science, LLC, New York The first commercial full digital hearing aid was created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation. The hearing aid contained a body-worn processor that had a hardwire connection with an ear mounted transducer. While the Nicolet Corporation's hearing aid was not publicly successful and the company shortly folded, it was able to start a competition among hearing aid manufacturers to create more effective full digital hearing aids. Two years later, in 1989, the commercial behind-the-ear (BTE) full digital hearing aid was launched. In addition to the Nicolet Corporation, Bell Laboratories expanded upon the hearing aid business by developing a hybrid digital-analog hearing aid. This hearing aid used digital circuits to handle a two-channel compression amplifier. Even though early research on this hearing aid was successful, AT&T;, the parent company to Bell Laboratories, pulled out of the hearing aid market and sold its rights to Resound Corporation in 1987. When the hybrid hearing aid was put on in the market, it helped bring major changes to the world of the hybrid hearing aid. After the success of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid manufacturers began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included analog amplifiers, filters, and limiters that were managed digitally. There were many benefits to these hearing aids that included storing parameter settings, having a capability for paired-comparison testing, having settings for different acoustic environments, and having more advanced methods of signal processing that included multi-channel compression. The next major milestone was creating a commercial full digital hearing aid. The Oticon Company developed the first commercial full digital hearing aid in 1995, but it was only distributed to audiological research centers for research on digital technology in the realm of acoustic amplification. The Senso was the first commercially successful, full digital hearing aid, and was created by Widex in 1996. After the success of the Senso, Oticon began marketing their own hearing aid, the DigiFocus. Current digital hearing aids are now programmable which enables digital hearing aids to regulate the sound on their own, without using a separate control. The full digital hearing aid can now adjust itself depending on what environment it is in and often does not even need a physical volume control button.Berger, Kenneth. \\"Hearing Aid Museum .\\" Kent State University Excellence in Action. http://www.kent.edu/ehhs/spa/museum/history.cfm (accessed May 15, 2011). Recently, \\"Made for iPhone hearing aids\\" (MFi) were introduced by Resound, which enables users of MFi digital hearing aids to stream phone calls, music, and podcasts directly from iOS devices.Apple, Inc. \\"Made for iPhone Hearing Aids\\" https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/hearing-aids/ (accessed January 28, 2016). Directly leveraging the audio processing power potential in smartphones, Jacoti BVBA from Belgium developed ListenApp, the first digital hearing aid application to win CE certification and FDA approval as a medical device.Jacoti, BVBA, \\"Jacoti ListenApp\\" https://www.jacoti.com/listenapp/ (accessed January 28, 2016). Hearing aid chips One of the first digital chips was created by Daniel Graupe. The digital chip, referred to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise. The chip was integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s. In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital chips that were devoted to high-speed digital signal processing or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, chips were produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these chips was the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these chips was that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.

First established in 1968 as \\"Mariculture Ltd\\" and later called \\"Cayman Turtle Farm\\" by a group of American and British investors, the facility was initially used to breed the endangered green sea turtle for commercial purposes. By raising the turtles in a farming operation, the turtle meat could be produced for local consumption without depleting the wild population of the species. Although still in operation as a farm for raising turtles in order to sell product, the Cayman Turtle Centre has been developed into an important research project and conservation facility. It is now also the largest land- based tourist attraction in the Cayman Islands and welcomes more than 500,000 visitors annually. History While on his maritime travels, Christopher Columbus, when coming across the Cayman Islands in 1503, called the islands \\"Las Tortugas\\", because of the abundance of green sea turtles found there. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cayman Islands became a stopping point for sea vessels sailing the Caribbean Sea in need of food; the turtles caught in the Caymans were taken aboard ship and kept alive as a source of fresh meat. As settlements and towns on the islands were established over time, \\"turtling\\" became a way of survival and means of income in the Caymans. By the 19th century, however, the turtle population around the islands was near depleted and commerce centred on the green sea turtle shifted to the Caribbean off the coast of Nicaragua in Central America.Young green sea turtle on Boatswain's Beach at Cayman Turtle Centre During the 20th century, turtles were still caught and used for their meat in the Caymans. However, the depletion of the species around the islands made it impossible locally for turtling to continue to be a viable source of income. In 1968, American and British investors — Irvin Naylor, Henry Hamlin, Samuel Ayres, III, and Anthony G.A. Fisher — obtained licensing from the Cayman Islands government and grouped together to found Mariculture Ltd, Fisher taking the largest shareholding. The Bank of England's CDFC became a participant in 1970, CDFC's covenant supporting 50% of the equity and loan finance raised by the end of the year. While Mariculture worked to domesticate the green sea turtle, protection regulations threatened to prevent the sale/transhipment of all turtle products in/through the United States and other countries, limiting the commercial value of the Mariculture product. By the mid-1970s, the facility housed near 100,000 turtles, the expansion requiring a substantial investment of cash. With potential new investors finally unconvinced that Mariculture would be able to sell its products internationally, Citibank and CDFC placed it in receivership in May 1975, and financed its operations until the Mittag family of Dusseldorf, along with CDFC, bought the assets and re-capitalised them as \\"Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd\\" in early 1976. Subsequently, as a goodwill gesture, the new company paid off all the left behind local trade creditors of Mariculture and - though lossmaking - was adequately financed during its seven years of life. By 1978, the Farm was self sufficient in eggs from its captive breeding herd, making it the first enterprise to domesticate the green sea turtle, but there was little recognition of this fact in conservation circles and their opposition found expression in the \\"bred in captivity\\" ruling of the 1979 CITES conference in Costa Rica, challenging the Farm's captive breeding status. A dialogue with the Cayman Government about the future commenced in 1980, and the turtle herds were slimmed down by a substantial release programme and culling, as a means of cutting costs whilst retaining the essence of the Farm. Eventually, after an eighteen month negotiation, the Farm was sold on to the Cayman Government in April 1983 and re-named \\"Cayman Turtle Farm (1983) Ltd\\". Its overseas markets had finally closed, but the sale was effected without financial loss to any party except shareholders, and within five years the slimmed down farm - now reliant on tourist visitors - was generating a cash surplus (see\\"Financing the Cayman Turtle 1968 to 1988\\" (Amazon.com). In 2010, the facility was renamed the Cayman Turtle Centre: Island Wildlife Encounter in order that visitors knew about the park's other attractions, beyond its sea turtles. Tourist attraction, conservation, and commerce With the centre becoming successful in breeding and researching the green sea turtle as well as the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, the centre became one of the most successful tourist attractions in the Caymans by the turn of the 21st century.Feeding time at Cayman Turtle Centre The centre is 23 acres and featured predators, birds, caiman, and other creatures in addition to turtles. In 2001, however, a severe setback to the success of the centre as an attraction and breeding and research facility located next to the sea occurred on November 4, 2001, when large waves generated by Hurricane Michelle inundated the facility. The hurricane was located 90 miles southwest of Grand Cayman and produced little wind, but the waves washed turtles of all sizes from hatchlings to 600 pound adults out to sea. Cayman residents responded to help rescue the turtles and many were saved at the time. For months thereafter, the yellow-tagged turtles from the centre were spotted around the island for following Hurricane Michelle. 75% of the breeding turtles were lost. The centre's release and meat supply programs were reduced in an effort to build up the population following the event. As a result of the disaster, the Cayman Islands government conceived a new vision for the centre when the breeding pond was relocated across West Bay Road from the current facility. The new and more modern facility was far enough away from the sea that it would no longer be in danger of high seas such as had been experienced during the 2001 hurricane season. As well, the new park became an expanded facility to include a nature park. The new tourist facility was named \\"Boatswain's Beach\\". Following the expansion, the entire park contained 23 acres that included a nature trail and aviary as well as a reef lagoon where visitors could snorkel with native fish and other local sea life, including the green sea turtle. A fresh water lagoon and waterfall was also included in addition to a predator tank where reef sharks would habitate. Visitors were still allowed entry to the areas around the turtle breeding and feeding tanks. In 2010 the facility changed its name from \\"Boatswain's Beach\\" to \\"Cayman Turtle Centre: Island Wildlife Encounter\\" and in 2012 it added a water slide feature to its fresh water lagoon. The Cayman Turtle Centre is the only facility of its kind in the world.NY Times Travel Review It is also the only facility to have achieved the second generation of sea turtles bred in captivity. It was also the first facility to successfully breed the endangered Kemp's Ridley turtle in captivity. Approximately 100 scientific papers have been presented or published based on work in collaboration with researchers at Cayman Turtle Centre. The largest turtle at the facility is Sparky, a 70-year-old female that weighs about 550 pounds. Controversy In the 2000s, the Cayman Turtle Centre has come under attack from animal welfare and conservation groups who claim the Centre is failing to meet the welfare needs of the animals in its care and poses a threat to wild turtle conservation. International animal protection group, the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) cites poor water quality, overcrowding, unsupervised human handling, heightened levels of disease and congenital defects amongst the captive bred creatures. The Cayman Turtle Centre: A Case for Change (2012) D'Cruze, N,. Joined in support by the Sea Turtle Conservancy, the world's oldest turtle conservation group, WSPA has launched a campaign to stop the Cayman Turtle Centre from breeding sea turtles for human consumption. Sir Paul McCartney, former member of The Beatles has supported the campaignPaul McCartney website and urged the Centre to shift towards a more humane, sustainable and profitable alternative. In the House of Commons, Early Day Motion (EDM) 612 from 2012, entitled \\"Cayman Turtle Centre\\" calls on the UK Government to condemn the practices of producing turtle meat for consumption and help assist the Centre in moving towards practices that promote the protection of turtles instead. The captive breeding programme at the Cayman Turtle Centre has long-since attracted criticism from conservation groups who claim that the centre runs the risk of introducing infectious diseases into the wild by releasing turtles that have been bred in captive conditions. Experts also claim that programmes of this kind fail to address the root causes of turtle decline and efforts would be better spent tackling illegal poaching – a problem that still continues in the Cayman Islands. However a panel of four international turtle experts that inspected the Centre in December 2012 concluded that the Centre had a \\"positive conservation impact\\" because it provided turtle meat to local consumers thus alleviating poaching of the wild population, it augmented the local turtle nesting population through past turtle releases, it enabled applied research of the animals over four decades, and it increased awareness of marine turtle conservation. In addition to claims of animal cruelty, the centre's business model has come under scrutiny for being uneconomical. According to WSPA, the Cayman Turtle Centre is making an average loss of over nine million Cayman dollars (approximately $10,976,000 US dollars) a year over the past five years and represents a huge burden for the tax payer. In April 2013 the Cayman Turtle Centre released data showing however that there are several positive indicators in its financial performance in recent years. The Cayman Turtle Centre has denied the allegations of cruelty and congenital defects, and stands by its claim to have released 31,000 green sea turtles into the wild since it was first established. WSPA has stated that on average, the centre has only released 27 turtles per year since 2007. The Cayman Turtle Centre has confirmed that after Hurricane Michelle wiped out 75 per cent of its breeding population, the centre cut back the number of releases annually, but as stocks rebuild its recent releases have been increasing, with 75 turtles released in 2011 and 150 in 2012. The Cayman Islands Department of the Environment has released data showing that turtles released as hatchlings or yearlings from Cayman Turtle Centre decades ago, are becoming sexually mature and are returning as adults to nest on Grand Cayman's beaches. Between 1999 and 2003, the mean annual number of green sea turtle nests in Grand Cayman was 16.4. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of green sea turtle nests on the island in recent years, reaching a high of 181 green sea turtle nests in 2012. Sightings of \\"living-tagged\\" nesting turtles have confirmed that some of these nests were laid by turtles released from Cayman Turtle Centre.

Fish respond to hypoxia with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses in order to maintain homeostasis and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for ATP production releasing the chemical energy of O2 through the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). \\"Oxygen Is the High-Energy Molecule Powering Complex Multicellular Life: Fundamental Corrections to Traditional Bioenergetics” ACS Omega 5: 2221-2233. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03352 Therefore, hypoxia survival requires a coordinated response to secure more oxygen from the depleted environment and counteract the metabolic consequences of decreased ATP production at the mitochondria. This article is a review of the effects of hypoxia on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes. Hypoxia tolerance A fish's hypoxia tolerance can be represented in different ways. A commonly used representation is the critical O2 tension (Pcrit), which is the lowest water O2 tension (PO2) at which a fish can maintain a stable O2 consumption rate (MO2). A fish with a lower Pcrit is therefore thought to be more hypoxia-tolerant than a fish with a higher Pcrit. But while Pcrit is often used to represent hypoxia tolerance, it more accurately represents the ability to take up environmental O2 at hypoxic PO2s and does not incorporate the significant contributions of anaerobic glycolysis and metabolic suppression to hypoxia tolerance (see below). Pcrit is nevertheless closely tied to a fish's hypoxia tolerance, in part because some fish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression. It therefore remains a widely used hypoxia tolerance metric. A fish's hypoxia tolerance can also be represented as the amount of time it can spend at a particular hypoxic PO2 before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the PO2 at which it loses equilibrium when PO2 is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called PO2-of- LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower PO2-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression. Oxygen consumption rate decreases with decreasing environmental oxygen tension (PO2) when PO2< Pcrit. On the other hand, oxygen consumption rate is unaffected by the changes in oxygen tension when PO2 > Pcrit Oxygen sensing Oxygen sensing structures In mammals there are several structures that have been implicated as oxygen sensing structures; however, all of these structures are situated to detect aortic or internal hypoxia since mammals rarely run into environmental hypoxia. These structures include the type I cells of the carotid body, the neuroepithelial bodies of the lungs as well as some central and peripheral neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells. In fish, the neuroepithelial cells (NEC) have been implicated as the major oxygen sensing cells. NEC have been found in all teleost fish studied to date, and are likely a highly conserved structure within many taxa of fish. NEC are also found in all four gill arches within several different structures, such as along the filaments, at the ends of the gill rakers and throughout the lamellae. Two separate neural pathways have been identified within the zebrafish gill arches both the motor and sensory nerve fibre pathways. Since neuroepithelial cells are distributed throughout the gills, they are often ideally situated to detect both arterial as well as environmental oxygen. Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release in neuroepithelial cells Neuroepithelial cells (NEC) are thought to be neuron- like chemoreceptor cells because they rely on membrane potential changes for the release of neurotransmitters and signal transmission onto nearby cells. Once NEC of the zebrafish gills come in contact with either environmental or aortic hypoxia, an outward K+ \\"leak\\" channel is inhibited. It remains unclear how these K+ channels are inhibited by a shortage of oxygen because there are yet to be any known direct binding sites for \\"a lack of oxygen\\", only whole cell and ion channel responses to hypoxia. K+ \\"leak\\" channels are two-pore- domain ion channels that are open at the resting membrane potential of the cell and play a major role in setting the equilibrium resting membrane potential of the cell. Once this \\"leak\\" channel is closed, the K+ is no longer able to freely flow out of the cell, and the membrane potential of the NEC increases; the cell becomes depolarized. This depolarization causes voltage- gated Ca2+ channels to open, and for extracellular Ca2+ to flow down its concentration gradient into the cell causing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to greatly increase. Once the Ca2+ is inside the cell, it binds to the vesicle release machinery and facilitates binding of the t-snare complex on the vesicle to the s-snare complex on the NEC cell membrane which initiates the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Signal transduction up to higher brain centres If the post-synaptic cell is a sensory neuron, then an increased firing rate in that neuron will transmit the signal to the central nervous system for integration. Whereas, if the post- synaptic cell is a connective pillar cell or a vascular smooth muscle cell, then the serotonin will cause vasoconstriction and previously unused lamellae will be recruited through recruitment of more capillary beds, and the total surface area for gas exchange per lamella will be increased. In fish, the hypoxic signal is carried up to the brain for processing by the glossopharyngeal (cranial nerve IX) and vagus (cranial nerve X) nerves. The first branchial arch is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX); however all four arches are innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). Both the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves carry sensory nerve fibres into the brain and central nervous system. Locations of oxygen sensors Through studies using mammalian model organisms, there are two main hypotheses for the location of oxygen sensing in chemoreceptor cells: the membrane hypothesis and the mitochondrial hypothesis. The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the carotid body in mice, and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process. The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the carotid body of mice, but it relies on the levels of oxidative phosphorylation and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia. Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K+ currents are inhibited by H2O2 and NADPH oxidase activation. There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study. For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the \\"membrane hypothesis\\" due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell. However, there is no evidence against multiple sites for oxygen sensing in organisms. Acute responses to hypoxia Many hypoxic environments never reach the level of anoxia and most fish are able to cope with this stress using different physiological and behavioural strategies. Fish that use air breathing organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing. Though all teleosts have some form of swim bladder, many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more oxygenated water at the surface of the water. However, many species of teleost fish are obligate water breathers and do not display either of these surface respiratory behaviours. Typically, acute hypoxia causes hyperventilation, bradycardia and an elevation in gill vascular resistance in teleosts. However, the benefit of these changes in blood pressure to oxygen uptake has not been supported in a recent study of the rainbow trout. It is possible that the acute hypoxia response is simply a stress response, and the advantages found in early studies may only result after acclimatization to the environment. Behavioral responses Hypoxia can modify normal behavior.Reebs, S.G. (2009) Oxygen and fish behaviour Parental behaviour meant to provide oxygen to the eggs is often affected by hypoxia. For example, fanning behavior (swimming on the spot near the eggs to create a flow of water over them, and thus a constant supply of oxygen) is often increased when oxygen is less available. This has been documented in sticklebacks,Iersel, J.J.A. van. 1953. An analysis of the parental behaviour of the male three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). Behaviour Supplement 3: 1-159.Sevenster, P. 1961. A causal analysis of a displacement activity (fanning in Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). Behaviour Supplement 9: 1-170. gobies, and clownfishes, among others. Gobies may also increase the size of the openings in the nest they build, even though this may increase the risk of predation on the eggs. Rainbow cichlids often move their young fry closer to the water surface, where oxygen is more available, during hypoxic episodes. Behavioural adaptations meant to survive when oxygen is scarce include reduced activity levels, aquatic surface respiration, and air breathing. Reduced activity levels As oxygen levels decrease, fish may at first increase movements in an attempt to escape the hypoxic zone, but eventually they greatly reduce their activity levels, thus reducing their energetic (and therefore oxygen) demands. Atlantic herring show this exact pattern. Other examples of fishes that reduce their activity levels under hypoxia include the common sole, the guppy, the small-spotted catshark, and the viviparous eelpout. Some sharks that ram-ventilate their gills may understandably increase their swimming speeds under hypoxia, to bring more water to the gills. Aquatic surface respiration In response to decreasing dissolved oxygen level in the environment, fish swim up to the surface of the water column and ventilate at the top layer of the water where it contains relatively higher level of dissolved oxygen, a behavior called aquatic surface respiration (ASR). Oxygen diffuses into water from air and therefore the top layer of water in contact with air contains more oxygen. This is true only in stagnant water; in running water all layers are mixed together and oxygen levels are the same throughout the water column. One environment where ASR often takes place is tidepools, particularly at night. Separation from the sea at low tide means that water is not renewed, fish crowding within the pool means that oxygen is quickly depleted, and absence of light at night means that there is no photosynthesis to replenish the oxygen. Examples of tidepool species that perform ASR include the tidepool sculpin, Oligocottus maculosus, the three-spined stickleback, and the mummichog. But ASR is not limited to the intertidal environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found that all of them performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice. Some species may show morphological adaptations, such as a flat head and an upturned mouth, that allow them to perform ASR without breaking the water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators). One example is the mummichog, whose upturned mouth suggests surface feeding, but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the tambaqui, a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR. Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some upside-down catfish. Some species may hold an air bubble within the mouth during ASR. This may assist buoyancy as well as increase the oxygen content of the water passing over the bubble on its way to the gills. Another way to reduce buoyancy costs is to perform ASR on rocks or plants that provide support near the water surface. ASR significantly affects survival of fish during severe hypoxia. In the shortfin molly for example, survival was approximately four times higher in individuals able to perform ASR as compared to fish not allowed to perform ASR during their exposure to extreme hypoxia.Plath M, Tobler M, Riesch R, García de León FJ, Giere O, Schlupp I. 2007. Survival in an extreme habitat: the roles of behaviour and energy limitation. Die Naturwissenschaften 94: 991-6. PMID ASR may be performed more often when the need for oxygen is higher. In the sailfin molly, gestating females (this species is a livebearer) spend about 50% of their time in ASR as compared to only 15% in non-gestating females under the same low levels of oxygen. Aerial respiration (air breathing) Aerial respiration is the 'gulping' of air at the surface of water to directly extract oxygen from the atmosphere. Aerial respiration evolved in fish that were exposed to more frequent hypoxia; also, species that engage in aerial respiration tend to be more hypoxia tolerant than those which do not air-breath during the hypoxia. There are two main types of air breathing fish—facultative and non- facultative. Under normoxic conditions facultative fish can survive without having to breathe air from the surface of the water. However, non-facultative fish must respire at the surface even in normal dissolved oxygen levels because their gills cannot extract enough oxygen from the water. Many air breathing freshwater teleosts use ABOs to effectively extract oxygen from air while maintaining functions of the gills. ABOs are modified gastrointestinal tracts, gas bladders, and labyrinth organs; they are highly vascularized and provide additional method of extracting oxygen from the air. Fish also use ABO for storing the retained oxygen. =Predation risk associated with ASR and aerial respiration= Both ASR and aerial respiration require fish to travel to the top of water column and this behaviour increases the predation risks by aerial predators or other piscivores inhabiting near the surface of the water. In order to cope with the increased predation risk upon surfacing, some fish perform ASR or aerial respiration in schools in order to 'dilute' the predation risk. When fish can visually detect the presence of their aerial predators, they simply refrain from surfacing, or prefer to surface in areas where they can be detected less easily (i.e. turbid, shaded areas). Gill remodelling in hypoxia Gill remodelling happens in only a few species of fish, and it involves the buildup or removal of an inter-lamellar cell mass (ILCM). As a response to hypoxia, some fish are able to remodel their gills to increase respiratory surface area, with some species such as goldfish doubling their lamellar surface areas in as little as 8 hours. The increased respiratory surface area comes as a trade-off with increased metabolic costs because the gills are a very important site for many important processes including respiratory gas exchange, acid-base regulation, nitrogen excretion, osmoregulation, hormone regulation, metabolism, and environmental sensing. The crucian carp is one species able to remodel its gill filaments in response to hypoxia. Their inter-lamellar cells have high rates of mitotic activity which are influenced by both hypoxia and temperature. In cold (15 °C) water the crucian carp has more ILCM, but when the temperature is increased to 25 °C the ILCM is removed, just as it would be in hypoxic conditions. This same transition in gill morphology occurs in the goldfish when the temperature was raised from 7.5 °C to 15 °C. This difference may be due to the temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures. Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20 °C in hypoxia, the crucian carp can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8 °C, the same process takes 3–7 days. The ILCM is likely removed by apoptosis, but it is possible that when the fish is faced with the double stress of hypoxia at high temperature, the lamellae may be lost by physical degradation. Covering the gill lamellae may protect species like the crucian carp from parasites and environmental toxins during normoxia by limiting their surface area for inward diffusion while still maintaining oxygen transport due to an extremely high hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity. The naked carp, a closely related species native to the high-altitude Lake Qinghai, is also able to remodel their gills in response to hypoxic conditions. In response to oxygen levels 95% lower than normoxic conditions, apoptosis of ILCM increases lamellar surface area by up to 60% after just 24 hours. However, this comes at a significant osmoregulatory cost, reducing sodium and chloride levels in the cytoplasm by over 10%. The morphological response to hypoxia by scaleless carp is the fastest respiratory surface remodelling reported in vertebrates thus far. Oxygen uptake Fish exhibit a wide range of tactics to counteract aquatic hypoxia, but when escape from the hypoxic stress is not possible, maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery becomes an essential component to survival. Except for the Antarctic ice fish that does not, most fish use hemoglobin (Hb) within their red blood cells to bind chemically and deliver 95% of the oxygen extracted from the environment to the working tissues. Maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery to the tissues allows continued activity under hypoxic stress and is in part determined by modifications in two different blood parameters: hematocrit and the binding properties of hemoglobin. Hematocrit In general, hematocrit is the number of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits,Perry, SF, Esbaugh, A, Braun, M, and Gilmour, KM. 2009. Gas Transport and Gill Function in Water Breathing Fish. In Cardio-Respiratory Control in Vertebrates, (ed. Glass ML, Wood SC), pp. 5-35. Berlin: Springer- Verlag. whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). While increasing hematocrit means that the blood can carry a larger total amount of oxygen, a possible advantage during hypoxia, increasing the number of RBCs in the blood can also lead to certain disadvantages. First, A higher hematocrit results in more viscous blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the branchial arch and the diffusion rate of oxygen, an increased hematocrit may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood. Changing the binding affinity of hemoglobin An alternative mechanism to preserve O2 delivery in the face of low ambient oxygen is to increase the affinity of the blood. The oxygen content of the blood is related to PaO2 and is illustrated using an oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC). Fish hemoglobins, with the exception of the agnathans, are tetramers that exhibit cooperativity of O2 binding and have sigmoidal OECs. Oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) demonstrating the PO2 required for half of the hemoglobin oxygen binding sites to be saturated with oxygen (P50) The binding affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen is estimated using a measurement called P50 (the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% bound with oxygen) and can be extremely variable. If the hemoglobin has a weak affinity for oxygen, it is said to have a high P50 and therefore constrains the environment in which a fish can inhabit to those with relatively high environmental PO2. Conversely, fish hemoglobins with a low P50 bind strongly to oxygen and are then of obvious advantage when attempting to extract oxygen from hypoxic or variable PO2 environments. The use of high affinity (low P50) hemoglobins results in reduced ventillatory and therefore energetic requirements when facing hypoxic insult. The oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin (Hb-O2) is regulated through a suite of allosteric modulators; the principal modulators used for controlling Hb-O2 affinity under hypoxic insult are: #Increasing RBC pH #Reducing inorganic phosphate interactions =pH and inorganic phosphates (Pi)= In rainbow trout as well as a variety of other teleosts, increased RBC pH stems from the activation of B-andrenergic exchange protein (BNHE) on the RBC membrane via circulating catelcholamines. This process causes the internal pH of the RBC to increase through the outwards movement of and inwards movement of . The net consequence of alkalizing the RBC is an increase in Hb-O2 affinity via the Bohr effect. The net influx of ions and the compensatory activation of -ATPase to maintain ionic equilibrium within the RBC results in a steady decline in cellular ATP, also serving to increase Hb-O2 affinity. As a further result of inward movement, the osmolarity of the RBC increases causing osmotic influx of water and cell swelling. The dilution of the cell contents causes further spatial separation of hemoglobin from the inorganic phosphates and again serves to increase Hb-O2 affinity. Intertidal hypoxia-tolerant triplefin fish (Family Tripterygiidae) species seem to take advantage of intracellular acidosis and appears to \\"bypasse\\" the traditional oxidative phosphorylation and directly drives mitochondrial ATP synthesis using the cytosolic pool of protons that likely accumulates in hypoxia (via lactic acidosis and ATP hydrolysis). =Changing Hb- isoforms= Nearly all animals have more than one kind of Hb present in the RBC. Multiple Hb isoforms (see isoforms) are particularly common in ectotherms, but especially in fish that are required to cope with both fluctuating temperature and oxygen availability. Hbs isolated from the European eel can be separated into anodic and cathodic isoforms. The anodic isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the cathodic lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance. Several species of African cichlids raised from early stage development under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions were contrasted in an attempt to compare Hb isoforms. They demonstrated there were Hb isoforms specific to the hypoxia-raised individuals. Metabolic challenge To deal with decreased ATP production through the electron transport chain, fish must activate anaerobic means of energy production (see anaerobic metabolism) while suppressing metabolic demands. The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression is essential to ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production. Switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism Aerobic respiration, in which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, is crucial to all water-breathing fish. When fish are deprived of oxygen, they require other ways to produce ATP. Thus, a switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism occurs at the onset of hypoxia. Glycolysis and substrate-level phosphorylation are used as alternative pathways for ATP production. However, these pathways are much less efficient than aerobic metabolism. For example, when using the same substrate, the total yield of ATP in anaerobic metabolism is 15 times lower than in aerobic metabolism. This level of ATP production is not sufficient to maintain a high metabolic rate, therefore, the only survival strategy for fish is to alter their metabolic demands. Metabolic suppression Metabolic suppression is the regulated and reversible reduction of metabolic rate below basal metabolic rate (called standard metabolic rate in ectothermic animals). This reduces the fish's rate of ATP use, which prolongs its survival time at severely hypoxic sub-Pcrit PO2s by reducing the rate at which the fish's finite anaerobic fuel stores (glycogen) are used. Metabolic suppression also reduces the accumulation rate of deleterious anaerobic end-products (lactate and protons), which delays their negative impact on the fish. The mechanisms that fish use to suppress metabolic rate occur at behavioral, physiological and biochemical levels. Behaviorally, metabolic rate can be lowered through reduced locomotion, feeding, courtship, and mating. Physiologically, metabolic rate can be lowered through reduced growth, digestion, gonad development, and ventilation efforts. And biochemically, metabolic rate can be further lowered below standard metabolic rate through reduced gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis and degradation rates, and ion pumping across cellular membranes. Reductions in these processes lower ATP use rates, but it remains unclear whether metabolic suppression is induced through an initial reduction in ATP use or ATP supply. The prevalence of metabolic suppression use among fish species has not been thoroughly explored. This is partly because the metabolic rates of hypoxia-exposed fish, including suppressed metabolic rates, can only be accurately measured using direct calorimetry, and this technique is seldom used for fish. The few studies that have used calorimetry reveal that some fish species employ metabolic suppression in hypoxia/anoxia (e.g., goldfish, tilapia, European eel) while others do not (e.g. rainbow trout, zebrafish). The species that employ metabolic suppression are more hypoxia-tolerant than the species that do not, which suggests that metabolic suppression enhances hypoxia tolerance. Consistent with this, differences in hypoxia tolerance among isolated threespine stickleback populations appear to result from differences in the use of metabolic suppression, with the more tolerant stickleback using metabolic suppression. Fish that are capable of hypoxia- induced metabolic suppression reduce their metabolic rates by 30% to 80% relative to standard metabolic rates. Because this is not a complete cessation of metabolic rate, metabolic suppression can only prolong hypoxic survival, not sustain it indefinitely. If the hypoxic exposure lasts sufficiently long, the fish will succumb to a depletion of its glycogen stores and/or the over- accumulation of deleterious anaerobic end-products. Furthermore, the severely limited energetic scope that comes with a metabolically suppressed state means that the fish is unable to complete critical tasks such a predator avoidance and reproduction. Perhaps for these reasons, goldfish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism in most hypoxic environments, reserving metabolic suppression for the extreme case of anoxia. Energy conservation In addition to a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis, it appears that some species of hypoxia-tolerant fish conserve energy by employing Hochachka's ion channel arrest hypothesis. This hypothesis makes two predictions: # Hypoxia- tolerant animals naturally have low membrane permeabilities # Membrane permeability decreases even more during hypoxic conditions (ion channel arrest) The first prediction holds true. When membrane permeability to Na+ and K+ ions was compared between reptiles and mammals, reptile membranes were discovered to be five times less leaky. The second prediction has been more difficult to prove experimentally, however, indirect measures have showed a decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in eel and trout hepatocytes during hypoxic conditions. Results seem to be tissue-specific, as crucian carp exposed to hypoxia do not undergo a reduction in Na+/K+ ATPase activity in their brain. Although evidence is limited, ion channel arrest enables organisms to maintain ion channel concentration gradients and membrane potentials without consuming large amounts of ATP. Enhanced glycogen stores The limiting factor for fish undergoing hypoxia is the availability of fermentable substrate for anaerobic metabolism; once substrate runs out, ATP production ceases. Endogenous glycogen is present in tissue as a long term energy storage molecule. It can be converted into glucose and subsequently used as the starting material in glycolysis. A key adaptation to long-term survival during hypoxia is the ability of an organism to store large amounts of glycogen. Many hypoxia-tolerant species, such as carp, goldfish, killifish, and oscar contain the largest glycogen content (300-2000 μmol glocosyl units/g) in their tissue compared to hypoxia-sensitive fish, such as rainbow trout, which contain only 100 μmol glocosyl units/g. The more glycogen stored in a tissue indicates the capacity for that tissue to undergo glycolysis and produce ATP. Tolerance of waste products When anaerobic pathways are turned on, glycogen stores are depleted and accumulation of acidic waste products occurs. This is known as a Pasteur effect. A challenge hypoxia-tolerant fish face is how to produce ATP anaerobically without creating a significant Pasteur effect. Along with a reduction in metabolism, some fish have adapted traits to avoid accumulation of lactate. For example, the crucian carp, a highly hypoxia-tolerant fish, has evolved to survive months of anoxic waters. A key adaptation is the ability to convert lactate to ethanol in the muscle and excrete it out of their gills. Although this process is energetically costly is it crucial to their survival in hypoxic waters. Gene expression changes DNA microarray studies done on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions have shown that at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, heme oxygenase 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of zebrafish and in non-muscle tissue of the common carp suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues. Microarray studies done on fish species exposed to hypoxia typically show a metabolic switch, that is, a decrease in the expression of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and an increase in expression of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism. Zebrafish embryos exposed to hypoxia decreased expression of genes involved in the citric acid cycle including, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, and increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis such as phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. A decrease in protein synthesis is an important response to hypoxia in order to decrease ATP demand for whole organism metabolic suppression. Decreases in the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, such as elongation factor-2 and several ribosomal proteins, have been shown in the muscle of the mudsucker and gills of adult zebrafish after hypoxia exposure . Research in mammals has implicated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) as a key regulator of gene expression changes in response to hypoxia However, a direct link between fish HIFs and gene expression changes in response to hypoxia has yet to be found. Phylogenetic analysis of available fish, tetrapod, and bird HIF-α and -β sequences shows that the isoforms of both subunits present in mammals are also represented in fish Within fish, HIF sequences group close together and are distinct from tetrapod and bird sequences. As well, amino acid analysis of available fish HIF-α and -β sequences reveals that they contain all functional domains shown to be important for mammalian HIF function, including the basic helix-loop- helix (bHLH) domain, Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), which render the HIF-α subunit sensitive to oxygen levels. The evolutionary similarity between HIF sequences in fish, tetrapods and birds, as well as the conservation of important functional domains suggests that HIF function and regulation is similar between fish and mammalian species. There is also evidence of novel HIF mechanisms present in fish not found in mammals. In mammals, HIF-α protein is continuously synthesized and regulated post-translationally by changing oxygen conditions, but it has been shown in different fish species that HIF-α mRNA levels are also responsive to hypoxia. In the hypoxia tolerant grass carp, substantial increases in HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNA were observed in all tissues after hypoxia exposure. Likewise, mRNA levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were hypoxia-responsive in the ovaries of the Atlantic croaker during both short and long term hypoxia.

Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in Windsor, Ontario, Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step-grandfather, leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers. He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964, and his engaging in a brief shoot- out with law enforcement ten months later. After this latter incident he spent 14 months, starting in April 1965, at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison in eastern Ontario. Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighborhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker. Lamb continued to show improvement, becoming a productive laborer on Barker's farm and earning the trust of the doctor's family. With Barker's encouragement, Lamb joined the Rhodesian Army in late 1973 and fought for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) for the rest of his life. He started his service in the Rhodesian Light Infantry, and won a place in the crack Special Air Service unit in 1975, but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later. Soon after he was promoted to lance-corporal, Lamb was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by friendly fire from one of his allies. He received what Newsweek called \\"a hero's funeral\\" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives. Early life alt=A landscape photograph of a modern North American city beside a river, taken from the other side of the water at a distance of perhaps 300 metres. A number of high-rise buildings are visible as well as a paved promenade on the waterfront. Mathew Charles Lamb was born in Windsor, Ontario on 5 January 1948, the only child of a 15-year-old mother who abandoned him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, aunts and uncles, he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a \\"little bastard\\". The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself, however; he often witnessed his step-grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy. Lamb started exhibiting violent traits of his own from an early age. Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins into his bedroom, locked them in a closet and threatened them. On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital. \\"I remember once,\\" said Greg Sweet, a childhood friend, \\"when he was about seven years old, he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces\\". Lamb first attended Colbourne School in Riverside where Collins later said he appeared to be normal. School staff agreed, later telling the Windsor Star that he rarely got into trouble, and was capable, but unable to concentrate for extended periods. Starting with Grade 8, when he was 13, Lamb went to St Jude's School in Windsor, where the other pupils found him to be distant and quiet. According to a fellow pupil, he spurned attempts by the other children to include him in their social circles. For example, Lamb once refused an invitation to a party, saying that he \\"didn't like to dance.\\" Developing a keen interest in weapons, Lamb began to carry a knife to school, which he had little hesitation in showing off. He also became fascinated with firearms; according to Sweet, he and Lamb \\"always had guns, from the time [they] were about 12 years old\\". Sweet later told the Windsor Star that police were not informed when, as a teenager, Lamb strolled down a residential street \\"firing a shotgun at the houses of people he didn't like\\". Sweet also said that around this time Lamb assembled a collection of bullets and wrote the names of various local policemen on them. Lamb's hobby even extended to crude bombs, which he taught himself to produce using parts of various weapons. When he accidentally detonated one of these concoctions during preparation his leg was sprayed with shrapnel. On 10 February 1964, barely a month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a physically imposing police sergeant outside the Windsor Arena and, in front of a large crowd of people, leaped upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the Windsor Star (published three years later), Lamb did this \\"for no apparent reason\\". Lamb was convicted of assault under the Juvenile Delinquents Act and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near London, Ontario, run by the Salvation Army. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended Assumption College School, where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out to look for work. He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months. Kingston Penitentiary On the evening of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a sporting goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb to come forward with his hands raised. \\"Don't shoot. I give up,\\" he said. He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for \\"breaking, entering and theft ... [and] possession of a .22 caliber revolver, dangerous to public peace\\". Motivated by a presentence investigation report characterizing Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison. According to Nosanchuk's account, the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation. The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965. alt=An ornate mock Greco-Roman entrance is viewed from the right by the viewer. The entrance is topped by a white stone tower, on top of which is a flagpole flying the Canadian flag, a red-white-red vertical tricolour with a red maple leaf in the middle. A tall, plain wall, lined on the far side with barbed wire, runs along the viewer's line of sight on either side of the entrance. Psychiatric examinations and psychological tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature young man who was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of \\"an obvious mental breakdown\\". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. \\"I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature,\\" he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as \\"elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility\\". Lamb attempted suicide several times and for years afterward bore scars where he had tried to slit his wrists. According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour \\"bordered on psychotic\\". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act. Lamb returned to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, but at the same time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as \\"borderline\\" or \\"marginal\\". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct. Shooting spree Incident Seventeen days after his release from Kingston Penitentiary, on the evening of 25 June 1966, Lamb discovered a shotgun in his uncle's house. He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22:00 Eastern Time, then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872. Six young people—Edith Chaykoski, 20, her 22-year-old brother Kenneth, his wife and three friends, 21-year-old Andrew Woloch, Vincent Franco and Don Mulesa—were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard on their way to a bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22:15. Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers, pointed the shotgun at them and said \\"Stop. Put up your hands!\\" When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward, towards Lamb, he shot her in the abdomen. Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot, which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski. Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house; his target, 19-year-old Grace Dunlop, was injured. As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned, Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door, which he had seemingly chosen at random. Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there, Ann Heaton, he threatened to kill her. When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police, Lamb fled, throwing the shotgun over the old couple's fence into a field. He returned to the Hesketh house and went to sleep. Edith Chaykoski died from her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the neighborhood during the morning and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's and concluded that the 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge. Psychiatric examination On the morning of 27 June 1966, Lamb appeared without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was \\"hyperactive and agitated\\"; he was unable to sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing. After dismissing a few more questions as \\"unimportant\\", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he \\"needed a lawyer\\". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb \\"leaping from topic to topic\\", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; he spoke in a casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said, \\"I don't remember.\\" Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, \\"I don't remember. Somewhere.\\" When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him. When the interview ended at 13:35, the doctor noted that he found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behavior \\"remarkable\\". Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and lack of memory credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been \\"suffering from a disease of the mind\\" at the time of the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality. Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre for a minimum of 30 days. Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at St Thomas Elgin General Hospital. Lamb described the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He said that on 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. \\"Next thing I knew,\\" he continued, \\"I was on the street.\\" He told Dolan that he had seen people \\"as if they were on television\\". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying \\"Put up your hands\\". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and \\"somehow\\" shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that \\"everything seemed unreal.\\" He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking \\"what the hell am I in here for\\" and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house. After 30 days, on 27 July, the staff at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had improved enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that the young man was now able to understand what the proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor. Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local legal aid plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had \\"no hesitation\\" in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him. Mental disorder defence Nosanchuk quickly resolved that the only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being hanged was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a mental disorder defence. At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a \\"slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence.\\" When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; \\"he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them,\\" Nosanchuk recalled. Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described. Lamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and there was no evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened \\"in detail\\". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he \\"clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse\\". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb \\"suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality\\", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court. However, Nosanchuk was still not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a defendant found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting on the advice of a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non- capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him for the rest of his life. Nosanchuk then considered whether or not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand. Trial After a brief preliminary hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly showed no signs of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb. Testimonies and cross-examinations ;Prosecution The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, began his case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that three hours after the shootings his nephew had told him that he \\"must have done it\\". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed. ;Defence The defence began to present its psychiatric evidence on the third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed \\"poor broad\\", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having \\"giggled\\" at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then \\"felt fuzzy\\" when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: \\"It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out.\\" The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate \\"the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being\\". In his cross-examination of the two doctors, Duchesne cited the psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed that it was not beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident. John Robinson, the governor of Essex County Jail, was then called by the defence. Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a \\"rampage\\". In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood. \\"I was amazed by what I saw,\\" Robinson said. \\"The pupils were dilated like someone who comes in heavy on narcotics—except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out.\\" George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world, which had existed in his mind since early childhood, and had been in a pre-psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966. This, he said, had boiled over into an \\"acute schizoid episode\\" on the night of the shootings. In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time. Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene were then called by Nosanchuk. George Darby told the court that in his conversations with Lamb the defendant had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him in an interview that he treated all people \\"like bugs\\" except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: \\"I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug.\\" Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences. ;Prosecution Duchesne now called on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd to counter the defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had suddenly abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane and said that he was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to understand the nature of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far. Closing statements ;Defence Nosanchuk gave his final statement to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury that every one of the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found not guilty by reason of insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ;Prosecution In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a \\"well- reasoned argument\\", which the jury paid rapt attention to. Duchesne declared that the incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne said that this was possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb not guilty by reason of insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts. Verdict Justice Stark then reviewed the evidence and advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, it was up to them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read. Psychiatric care Treatment at Oak Ridge As had been made clear several times before and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council. Elliot Barker, the head of Oak Ridge's therapeutic division, had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial. The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic tranquillisation and electroconvulsive therapy, supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more of their time in each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. \\"My original vision,\\" he writes, \\"was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community.\\" Barker's \\"Social Therapy Unit\\" (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction. Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail, volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge as if she were a patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were \\"pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... [displaying] individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus.\\" In August 1968 the unit created a \\"Total Encounter Capsule\\", which was a windowless, soundproofed room, wide and long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat on the floor and a ceiling containing a one-way mirror. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide \\"a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions.\\" Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature. Following his arrival in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal Gazette writes, \\"a model inmate\\". He became widely respected by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's \\"patient therapist\\". \\"He was helpful to the other patients,\\" Barker told the Globe and Mail, \\"and they looked up to him.\\" Barker elaborated on this subject in an interview with the Windsor Star, telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been \\"one of the most respected therapists in the hospital\\". Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute. Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at Ontario Police College in Aylmer, where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential. After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person. The advisory board's recommendation that Lamb be released was approved by the Ontario Executive Council in early 1973; the board gave him a clean bill of health and said he was no longer dangerous. Release and further improvement The conditions of Lamb's release were that he must spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80 sq km; 0.31 sq mi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate proved to be an industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man. During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including The Mask of Sanity by Hervey M. Cleckley, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. \\"He wanted that kind of life,\\" Barker later told the Globe and Mail. \\"He really seemed to need the esprit de corps of an army organisation.\\" When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the Yom Kippur War, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought State of Israel Bonds and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home. He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia. Military career in Rhodesia alt=A map. See description On his way to Australia in October 1973, Lamb stopped off in South Africa and Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), where he cut his travels short to enlist in the Rhodesian Army. According to Barker, Lamb travelled to Africa with this intention all along. Rhodesia's unrecognised and predominantly white government was at that time fighting a war against communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas who were attempting to forcibly introduce majority rule. Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces, Lamb mustered into the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter-insurgency operations. He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside. \\"In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions,\\" writes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, \\"and like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant.\\" So it proved for Lamb; keeping his past a secret, he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando, RLI, noted for his professionalism and physical fitness. \\"The Rhodesians thought he was a first- class soldier,\\" Barker later told the Globe and Mail. Lamb visited his aunt and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975, \\"proudly wearing his uniform\\", journalist Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. \\"He had the uniform and looked a little different,\\" Richard told the Windsor Star a year later, \\"but I never forgot his face.\\" Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused to leave the house alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he \\"didn't want it associated with his adopted country\\". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service. Lamb was deeply saddened by the bias he perceived the Western media to have against the Rhodesian government and army, but was reportedly conspicuous for leaping to the defence of any black Rhodesians he thought were receiving bad treatment. \\"He sympathised with the blacks,\\" Barker told the Windsor Star, \\"but believed that chaos would result if they took over immediately. He used to scrap with other soldiers who treated blacks badly. He was very bright and knew the blacks would eventually take over the country.\\" Soon after his furlough to Canada, Lamb was transferred from the RLI to the elite Special Air Service (SAS) unit in September 1975. There he trained as a paratrooper and, after passing selection, found himself in a vastly different role to the one he had become used to during his time in the RLI. Rather than taking part in the RLI's fast and furious Fireforce counter-strike procedures, he found himself taking part in covert reconnaissance actions, \\"acting as eyes and ears,\\" as Barbara Cole writes. Wishing to see more action, Lamb requested a posting back to the RLI, which was granted; he rejoined 3 Commando. In late 1976, at the age of 28, he was promoted to lance corporal and took command of a \\"stick\\" of four men from 12 Troop, 3 Commando on Fireforce duty on Operation Thrasher, which covered Rhodesia's eastern highlands against guerrilla activity. In the late afternoon of 7 November 1976, three insurgents from a group of seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man \\"stops\\" involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. \\"They are going to get me this time,\\" he yelled, sardonically; \\"Just you watch, Phil Kaye!\\" Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. \\"Go nail gooks!\\" Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands. Stop 2 landed, formed up into a sweep line and marched carefully to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as they came to a widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at Chipinga. The death was officially recorded as \\"killed in action\\", with no reference to friendly fire. Reactions to death; military funeral and burial As Lamb had predicted, his death provoked stories in the Canadian local and national media that strongly stressed his history of violence and insanity., , , , , It even caused a heated debate in the Canadian House of Commons over why, considering his personal history in Ontario and subsequent service in the armed forces of a country Canada did not recognise, Lamb had been issued a valid Canadian passport and allowed to renew it on 26 April 1976. The Chaykoski family received the news with some relief, Wanless reported in the Windsor Star, having \\"lived in terror\\" since Lamb's release from Penetanguishene three years earlier. In Rhodesia, by contrast, Lamb was posthumously held in very high regard by the men who had served alongside him. His photograph in full dress uniform was placed on 3 Commando's Wall of Honour and remained there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980. When the story of his earlier life in Canada was run by the Rhodesia Herald, the paper received numerous strongly worded letters from soldiers who refused to believe it. They demanded a printed retraction and apology, which the Herald gave soon after to preempt any further scandal., , The lance-corporal was given what the Windsor Star and Newsweek both described as a \\"hero's funeral\\" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, on 15 November 1976. No members of his family were present. His coffin, draped in the Rhodesian flag and topped with a large bouquet of flowers, was carried on a gun carriage to Warren Hills Cemetery, on the western outskirts of the city, where soldiers of the RLI fired three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the coffin was carried to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men. Lamb's ashes were afterwards returned to his relatives in Windsor, Ontario, where they were buried alongside the remains of his grandmother., Notes and references ;Notes ;Online sources * * ;Newspaper and journal articles  * * ;Bibliography  * Category:1948 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian criminals Category:Canadian emigrants to Rhodesia Category:Canadian military personnel killed in action Category:Canadian spree killers Category:Deaths by firearm in Rhodesia Category:Foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian Security Forces Category:People acquitted by reason of insanity Category:People acquitted of murder Category:Canadian people convicted of assault Category:People convicted of burglary Category:People from Windsor, Ontario Category:People with antisocial personality disorder Category:Rhodesian Light Infantry personnel Category:Rhodesian military personnel killed in action Category:Rhodesian military personnel of the Bush War Category:Rhodesian Special Air Service personnel ","title":"Mathew Charles Lamb"},{"id":"33949477","text":"NBA All-Star Challenge is a video game for the Super NES, the Game Boy and the Sega Genesis.

The complex is located on the summit of a slight knoll about ten metres from the shoreline of the Holy Loch on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll, Scotland. The existing church dates from 1841Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. and occupies the site of an older, medieval church.

The remains of a 12th-century church are still visible.Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. At the present site, a church building is recorded in the 13th century. By the 15th century, the significance of Kilmun as a local centre of Christianity was so great that the adjacent loch became known as the Holy Loch, and the powerful Clan Campbell adopted it as their spiritual home.Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. From the 14th century, Dunoon Castle, a short distance away, was held by the Campbell family and in the 1440s Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochawe (later 1st Lord Campbell), the then chief of the clan, lived near Kilmun in a private residence named Strathechaig.Historic Kilmun, The Argyll Mausoleum: List of Burials (online), access date 9 April 2015. When his eldest son Archibald died tragically in 1442, the young man was laid to rest at Kilmun. This marked the beginning of the tradition of Kilmun as Campbell burial place. Soon after this, the said Sir Duncan Campbell endowed Kilmun parish church as a collegiate church, ensuring continued praying there for him, his ancestors and his descendants. At that time, Kilmun was closely linked with Paisley Abbey, and St Munn was adopted as the patron saint of Clan Campbell. At the collegiate church, a provost and five chaplains were appointed. The now partly ruined tower to the west of Kilmun Parish Church was the residence for these six clergymen and a place of refuge for the local population during dangerous times.Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. The clergymen at Kilmun were priests living as a community, not actual monks, and could have played an active part in the local community in addition to their religious duties of saying prayers and masses.Historic Klmun, Kilmun Church and Argyll Mausoleum, souvenir booklet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. Duncan Campbell died in 1453 and was buried near the altar of his collegiate church. This began the tradition of burying chiefs of Clan Campbell at Kilmun.Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. In 1688 the choir of the collegiate church was re-built to serve as a parish church. In 1841 the bulk of the collegiate church was demolished to make way for a new church designed by architect Thomas Burns. A new church building had become necessary to house the increasing number of summer visitors to the Holy Loch. A thorough restoration of the parish church and Argyll Mausoleum was carried out in the 1890s, led by the Marquess of Lorne, who later succeeded as 9th Duke of Argyll. Between 1898 and 1899, the architect Peter McGregor Chalmers re-arranged the interior of the church and also designed much of the carved chancel furniture and paneling. Kilmun Parish Church became a Category-A-listed building on 20 July 1971. Following a lengthy period of gradual degradation by water damage to the Argyll Mausoleum, which had started with the installation of the large cast iron dome in the 1890s and which had begun to affect Kilmun Parish Church during the 1970s, a charitable company (Argyll Mausoleum Ltd) was established by local activists to manage a major renovation project,Laura Maxwell, \\"Effort to save Campbell mausoleum\\", BBC Scotland news, 6 January 2010 (online), access date 9 April 2015. the first since the refurbishment of the mausoleum under the Marquess of Lorne in the 1890s.

Having raised nearly £600,000 to carry out the work, conservation architects and building contractors were appointed in 2011. During the last quarter of 2012, Argyll Mausoleum Ltd focused on historical research and the archaeological study of the site. Conservation of the mausoleum and construction of the visitor centre with a series of interpretation panels began in the spring of 2013, and the refurbished site was opened to the public in April 2015. Volunteers now offer regular guided tours of both church and mausoleum on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, from the beginning of April through to the end of October. The Church of Scotland are currently seeking to dispose of Kilmun Parish Church; it is no longer an active place of worship for the dwindling local community. Architecture The church's façade with the modern bell tower. =Exterior= St Munn's is built of snecked, squared sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings. The roof is made of grey slate. The main body of the church is on a T-shaped floor plan, with the nave extending to the north. At the head of the T-shaped building is a small, modern square bell tower with corner finials and a pierced stone parapet, over an advanced, gabled central bay. The old tower to the west of the present church, which features ashlar sandstone, seems to have been part of the medieval parish church which was endowed as a collegiate church in 1442 by Sir Duncan Campbell. The church is lit by single lancet windows on the main southern wall and by wider traceried lancets on the eastern and western gables. The church contains a number of stained glass windows, many by Stephen Adam, including life of Christ scenes and a portrait of George Miller of Invereck as St Matthew. Adam's successor, Alfred Webster, designed a number of later windows, including a war memorial window in the northern gable. The halls in the north-western angle of the church were built in 1909–10, also by Chalmers. Piend-roofed, with mullioned and leaded windows. =Interior= In 1898–99, the architect Peter McGregor Chalmers re-arranged the interior of St Munn's, forming an open choir in the place of the closed vestry on the southern wall. He introduced new arcades supporting the eastern and western galleries. Much of the intricately carved chancel furniture and panelling was also designed by McGregor Chalmers. The church's flat ceiling is supported by decorative Tudor-arched trusses supported on stone corbels. The walls are rendered with exposed sandstone dressings and panelled to dado height. The church contains a hydraulically powered organ by Norman & Beard of 1909,Scotland's Churches Trust: Kilmun Parish Church website (online), access date 9 April 2015. which (apart from St. Mary's, DalkeithSt Mary's Dalkeith History) is probably the only water-powered organ in Scotland still in use. Argyll Mausoleum History The Argyll Mausoleum is separate from, but attached to, St Munn's Church. The mausoleum was commissioned in the 1790s by John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll to house the remains of the Dukes and Earls of Argyll, Chiefs of the Clan Campbell, and their families.Historic Kilmun, The Argyll Mausoleum: History Through Pictures (online), access date 8 April 2015. It is currently managed by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, under the banner of Historic Kilmun, who also have a modern visitor centre in the vestry of Kilmun Church, open between April and October (inclusive) on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Constructed in 1795–96 to the designs of James Lowrie, the Argyll Mausoleum is the burial place of most Dukes of Argyll. It was built around an already extant Campbell vault which was originally located inside the collegiate church. Beginning with Archibald Campbell in 1442, the early burials on the site were under the floor of the medieval church, but the practice was forbidden in 1588 during the Reformation.Historic Klmun, Visit Historic Klmun, leaflet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. While outlawing burials inside churches, it did not put an immediate end to the practice, and the Campbells eventually began to build a 'burial aisle', attached to the church.Argyll and the Isles’ Secrets Collection: St Munns and the Argyll Mausoleum, published by forargyll.com on 28 April 2013 (online), access date 10 April 2015. A private chapel with family vault was constructed off the nave of the church by the 9th Earl of Argyll in 1669. This vault remained in situ when the collegiate church was demolished and the present church built. When the private chapel was demolished and a separate mausoleum built in its place, some of the more important remains were moved from the private chapel into the mausoleum. These included the effigies of Duncan Campbell and his wife. When in 1841 the old collegiate church was replaced, partially on the original site, by the current larger parish church, two of the walls of the Argyll Mausoleum were integrated into the new church.Argyll and the Isles’ Secrets Collection: St Munns and the Argyll Mausoleum, published by forargyll.com on 28 April 2013 (online), access date 10 April 2015. The current building thus replaces an earlier chapel in the collegiate church and records indicate that Chiefs of the Clan Campbell have been buried or commemorated here since the 15th century – a total of twenty generations over 500 years. When the Argyll Mausoleum was built in the 1790s, it first had a slate pyramid roof. The slate roof was replaced with a large cast iron dome during a thorough restoration of the mausoleum in the 1890s which was led by the Marquess of Lorne. While the installation of the large cast iron dome helped to improve lighting within the mausoleum, it was never properly sealed to the supporting walls and water began to enter the building. Water ingress seems to have been confined to the Argyll Mausoleum itself until around the 1970s. It then started to affect the adjacent parish church. St Munn's congregation were concerned and, assuming that the mausoleum was the property of the Duke of Argyll's Estates, requested that the problem be addressed. It turned out that the Dukes of Argyll did not own the mausoleum, but that it had transferred to the ownership of the Argyll and Bute Council in the 1920s. A 30-year legal wrangle ensued, before the situation was finally resolved and the Council conceded ownership of the deteriorating building. In the early 2000s, a survey described the state of the mausoleum: \\"It has got water coming in the roof, water coming in the walls (...) Every time I come here I see more pieces of stone dropping off. The place is desperately in need of restoration.\\" The necessary work was eventually carried out under the management of Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, with funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and the mausoleum was reopened in April 2015. You can now visit the beautifully restored mausoleum, church and visitor centre from Thurs - Saturday, 10am - 4pm, between the beginning of April and the end of October. Architecture =Exterior= The Argyll Mausoleum is located at the north-east corner of the church and connected with the latter. The mausoleum is on a square-shaped floor plan with the pointed-arched entrance on the northern elevation, flanked by two blind- traceried lancets and applied pilasters. One of the most noticeable features of the Argyll Mausoleum is the large cast iron dome over the building. When it was constructed in the 1790s, the mausoleum had a slated pyramid roof with no windows. This had the effect that no daylight could enter the building, except when the doors were open. When the Marquess of Lorne supervised his mother's funeral in 1878, he described the interior of the mausoleum as 'ghastly'. When he supervised the restoration of the mausoleum in the 1890s, he had the pyramid roof replaced in 1891–93 by a domed roof with rooflights and an enormous cast iron dome at the apex. It is believed that the massive cast iron dome was forged at a foundry in the Glasgow shipyards and transported to the site. The craftsmen's marks can still be seen on the inside of the roof. The decision to put such a heavy object on the extant mausoleum walls seems to have been controversial at the time, although the weight proved to have little detrimental effect. =Interior= The interior of the Argyll Mausoleum consists of two platforms on the side walls with niches for coffins, which are covered with inscribed sandstone slabs. In addition to the tombs lining both sides of the mausoleum, there are also graves under the stone floor. Amongst the slabs set onto the floor, there is a metal cross with \\"Archibald, Marquis of Argyll\\" carved on the shaft and \\"Beheaded 1661\\" on the crossbar – the final resting place of Archibald Campbell, 8th Earl and 1st Marquess of Argyll,Argyll and the Isles’ Secrets Collection: St Munns and the Argyll Mausoleum, published by forargyll.com on 28 April 2013 (online), access date 10 April 2015. whose body was buried at Kilmun after his execution in Edinburgh in 1661, his head being interred here three years later. His actual resting place was forgotten until the 1890s. As part of the restoration work carried out at the Argyll Mausoleum by the Marquess of Lorne, a pit was dug down the side of the mausoleum's inside wall to see how deep the foundations went and how strong they were. When the builders got to six feet down they found a skeleton and a skull alongside it, with a spike hole through it. The builder’s notes also record finding a yellow wig there, and that it fell apart as soon as he touched it. Archibald Campbell was reburied in the centre of the mausoleum, with a cross to his memory set in the floor. At its foot, set low in the east of the walled burial aisle containing the Campbell tombs and carrying the commemorative stone plaques, is a plaque carrying the words spoken by him just before his execution.Argyll and the Isles’ Secrets Collection: St Munns and the Argyll Mausoleum, published by forargyll.com on 28 April 2013 (online), access date 10 April 2015. On the south wall there is a wide cusped arch over a niche containing two 15th century effigies. One is that of Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell, the founder of the collegiate church, in full armour. The second effigy is of a female, probably Campbell's second wife, Margaret Stewart, the daughter of Sir John Stewart of Ardgowan.RCAHMS (1992) Argyll. An Inventory of the Monuments, Vol. 7, Mid Argyll and Cowal, Medieval and later monuments. These two medieval burial effigies are thought to be the last examples of such quality in Scotland. The decorated cusped arch over the two effigies was added in 1892 as part of the restoration work carried out by the Marquess of Lorne.Historic Klmun, Kilmun Church and Argyll Mausoleum, souvenir booklet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. In the centre aisle of the mausoleum, between the tombs lining both side walls, stood a life-sized sculpture of an angel lifting Christ from the Cross. It was made by the Marquess of Lorne's wife, Princess Louise (Queen Victoria's fourth daughter), who was a skilled artist and had married the future 9th Duke of Argyll in 1871 and now resides inside a glass showcase in the visitor centre. Three casts were made of Princess Louise's design, one forming the monument to colonial soldiers of the Boer War in St Paul's Cathedral, London, while another is a memorial to Princess Louise's brother-in-law, Prince Henry of Battenberg, in St. Mildred's Church, Whippingham. The cast placed in the Argyll Mausoleum may have been a tribute to her father-in-law, the 8th Duke of Argyll.Historic Klmun, Kilmun Church and Argyll Mausoleum, souvenir booklet by Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, Kilmun 2015. Campbell burials Arms of the Campbell Dukes of Argyll Kilmun Parish Church and the Argyll Mausoleum mark the burial place of many members of the Clan Campbell of Argyll from the 15th to the 20th century, including most Dukes and Duchesses of Argyll. It is believed that the earliest Chiefs of the Clan Campbell were laid to rest at Kilchrenan, and then on the island of Inishail in Loch Awe. When in 1442 Sir Duncan Campbell's eldest son Archibald died and a fierce snowstorm prevented the burial party from reaching the island of Inishail, the young man was buried at Kilmun, thus beginning the tradition of Kilmun as burial place of the Campbells. Various sources detail the names of the Campbell family members buried at Kilmun, and it can be seen that almost all clan Chiefs were buried here from 1442 until 1949. While the precise location of the early burials of members of the Clan Campbell on the Kilmun site is unknown, the location of the more recent interments in the Argyll Mausoleum is clearly visible. While the burials of clan Chiefs' wives were not recorded in the same way, the majority of them will have been buried beside their husbands and other unrecorded close family members will also lie at Kilmun. Burials of members of the Campbell family at Kilmun, both at the church and in the Argyll Mausoleum, include: Chiefs of the Clan Campbell buried elsewhere include the 2nd Duke of Argyll († 1743) who was buried at Westminster Abbey in London, as well as the 11th Duke of Argyll († 1973) and the 12th Duke of Argyll († 2001), who both chose to be buried on the island of Inishail in Loch Awe. Churchyard The churchyard at Kilmun Parish Church contains a number of interesting memorials, including later medieval tapered slabs and several high quality post-medieval headstones (mainly from the 17th and 18th century) as well as table-tombs carved with trade tools and the Douglas Mausoleum (see below). The graveyard was extended twice, at first to the north and later to the west, taking up some of the grounds of Old Kilmun House. The churchyard walls are likely to date from 1818 to 1819, when the graveyard was laid out in its present form. As part of the programme of community events organized by the Argyll Mausoleum Ltd, several areas of the graveyard have now been surveyed and the inscriptions been recorded. Photos have been taken of most of the gravestones. Notable burials The graveyard is said to be the burial place of St Munn (Fintán of Taghmon), who is also the patron saint of Clan Campbell. In the north-west of the church is the mausoleum of Sir John Douglas. The octagonal structure was built in 1888 from red sandstone and features rock-cut ashlar walls, a studded timber door with a carved armorial panel above it and a stone-slabbed roof. The mausoleum contains the remains of General Sir John Douglas of Glenfinart, GCB (1817–1888), a military commander during the Indian Mutiny. To the north of the church is the final resting place of Elizabeth Blackwell, the first qualified female physician in the United States.

Landau (born c. 1948) is a noted thief of presidential artifacts, collector of presidential artifacts, author, and \\"self-styled 'America's Presidential Historian'\\". In July 2011, Landau's associate, 24-year-old Jason Savedoff, was seen taking a document out of a library. After investigation and searches, Landau and Savedoff were \\"charged with stealing valuable historical documents from the Maryland Historical Society and conspiring to steal documents from other archives.\\" After pleading guilty, Landau was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in June 2012. Biography Landau stated his interest in the presidency began at the age of 10, when his mother took him to see then President Dwight D. Eisenhower; he claimed to have spoken with both the president and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower at that time. The Wall Street Journal, however, reported that he wrote a letter to the president and received a card in reply. He worked as a press agent in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. He also claimed that \\"he was a protocol officer under President Gerald R. Ford and that he once traveled to Moscow with President Richard M. Nixon,\\" though the presidential libraries could find no supporting evidence. He amassed such a large collection of presidential memorabilia that, in 2005, Larry Bird, a curator of the National Museum of American History, stated that he possessed \\"the most extensive collection of inaugural memorabilia outside the Smithsonian, the National Archives or the presidential libraries.\\" For the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies turned to him for china plates for the inaugural luncheon. In 2007, Landau wrote a book titled The President's Table and showed off some prized pieces of his collection on The Martha Stewart Show. He also served as a commentator on CNN and NBC's Today Show. Thefts The staff of the Maryland Historical Society became suspicious of the behavior of frequent visitors Landau and 24-year-old Jason Savedoff, whom Landau had identified as his nephew, though they are not related. Landau \\"certainly was very personable; he had class. He knew how to conduct himself in a research library, but Savedoff, of whom little is known, was 'rough around the edges' and 'repeatedly asked naive questions,' he said\\". On July 9, 2011, a staff member saw Savedoff take a document out of the society's library in Baltimore and police were called. They found sixty documents hidden in Savedoff's laptop case in a locker, several of them having been signed out by Landau. According to Landau’s plea agreement, from December 2010 through July 2011, Landau and Savedoff stole documents from numerous institutions, including the Maryland Historical Society, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Connecticut Historical Society, the University of Vermont, the New York Historical Society, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library, a component of the National Archives. Papers on file in federal court in Maryland show that the FBI also recovered documents stolen from historical societies or museums in Connecticut and Vermont. In total, more than ten thousand items were taken. Their worth has been estimated as high as 2.5 million. Items stolen included letters by Marie Antoinette, Napoleon Bonaparte, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Francis Scott Key, Karl Marx, Thomas Paine, Edgar Allan Poe and George Washington. Seven signed 'reading copies' of speeches by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (the actual copies of the speeches Roosevelt read from, including his handwritten edits and additions) were also taken. These included the reading copy of Roosevelt's inaugural address. Landau sold four of these speeches to a collector for $35,000. All were recovered. Landau and Savedoff were jailed in Baltimore and indicted by a federal grand jury in late July 2011. Landau was released with GPS monitoring. Savedoff surrendered his American and Canadian passports, and was released on $250,000 bail. Both defendants pleaded guilty, Savedoff in October 2011 and Landau in February 2012. On June 27, 2012, Landau was sentenced to seven years in prison. He also had to pay restitution of $46,525 to dealers who unwittingly purchased stolen documents from him.  Return of documents  The rightful owners of all the stolen documents recovered have been identified. , only twenty percent of the documents have been returned to them, with the remainder to be returned in the following months.

It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. The station is located on the Mannheim–Frankfurt railway, where the Worms–Biblis railway branches off to Worms. Both lines developed from the Riedbahn (Ried Railway). History  On 29 May 1869 the line from Darmstadt via Riedstadt- Goddelau and Biblis to the Rosengarten station, on the opposite side of the Rhine to Worms, was opened by the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Reinhard Carl Friedrich von Dalwigk. From Rosengarten station, trains crossed the Rhine from 1870 to 1900 using the Worms-Rosengarten train ferry, as there was no bridge across the Rhine at Worms. In October 1879 the line was extended via Waldhof to Mannheim Neckarstadt where it ended not at Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, but at the Riedbahnhof (Ried Railway station), north of the present Kurpfalz bridge. Since November 1879 trains have run on the Ried Railway through Biblis from Worms to Frankfurt (branching off at Riedstadt- Goddelau) and since 1880 from Mannheim Hauptbahnhof to Frankfurt. Operations With 650 trains per day (as of 2007) the Ried Railway is one of the most congested railway lines in Germany. By 2015 a further increase to 900 trains is expected. The line carries three Intercity-Express lines, connecting southern Germany with Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne/Dortmund. However, only regional trains stop at Biblis station. Regional services on the next Ried Railway are organised by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar. Biblis station is served by Regional-Express service RE 70 between Mannheim and Frankfurt. Regionalbahn service RB 62 operate to Worms, connecting with Regional-Express services to Mannheim and to Frankfurt. Regionalbahn trains to Mannheim and Karlsruhe are expected to be replaced by Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn services.

W. Johnston (October 2, 1876 – July 29, 1946) was an Irish American stage and film actor who started as a supporting actor and, briefly, leading man in the 1910s and early 1920s, continued as a character performer from the mid-1920s, and ended as an unbilled bit player during the 1930s and 1940s. He was also an early member of Cecil B. DeMille's repertory company of actors, appearing in five of the director's features released between July and December 1914. Although J. W. Johnston was his most frequent billing, other appellations included J. W. Johnson, Jack W. Johnson, Jack Johnson, F. W. Johnston, John W. Johnston, Jack Johnston, Jack W. Johnston and Jack Johnstone. Biography John William Michael Johnston was born in the County Clare town of Kilkee, on 2 October 1876. John William Michael was the middle child of three known children born to Charles Johnston (1842 – ?) and Jane Mary Hartney (1838 – ?). Johnston had two sisters, Alicia Ellena (b. 1875 d. before 1882) and Janetta M (b. 1878 d. 1879Death certificate.). Little is known of Johnston's life before he goes to America. Johnston travelled to America with his parents on the ship Britanic arriving in New York on the 12 August 1882 when he was 5 years old. Over the years Johnston made several trips between Ireland and America. On August 16, 1896 John Johnston married Allice Aloysuis Harrington and they had 4 children, Genevieve Johnston (1898–1898) who died at 5 mths, then twins Edward and Charles Johnston (1899–1899) both died soon after birth, and their last child Vincent Johnston (1900–?). We know Allice Harrington and John Johnston were living with their son Vincent in the Bronx, NY at the time of the 1910 Census however they divorced sometime before 1914 when Johnston married his second wife, Onida Foster, a school teacher from Louisiana. On the marriage certificate Johnston is 37, states his occupation as salesman. There is a record of his World War I draft card (1918) on which he lists Onida as his wife and his occupation as Actor being employed by Frank Talbot Modern Pictures Co. Johnston also states on this record that he is a US citizen by his father's Naturalisation prior to his reaching the age of majority. Variety mentions that his initial Broadway appearance was in Paul Potter's stage adaptation of Ouida's popular historical romance, Under Two Flags, starring Blanche Bates, which opened at Garden Theatre on February 5, 1901 and closed in June. 24 years old during the show's run, Johnston persisted as a theatre actor for another ten years and made his first film, a Pathé Frères short entitled The Reporter in 1911. Continuing to perform in numerous other short films (virtually all productions of the early 1910s were between one and three reels in length), the following year he joined filmmakers' exodus to the newly formed West Coast motion picture mecca of Hollywood. Seen in at least eight films in 1912, he made twenty-six in 1913 and sixteen in 1914, with six of the 1914 titles extended to feature length, including the five DeMilles, in first of which, The Man on the Box, a comedy- drama released in July, he had a prominent supporting role as a character named Count Karloff. Playing the title character's best friend, Steve, who is lynched as a cattle thief in The Virginian, the director's first major success, was next, in September. There were two titles in November, The Man from Home and Rose of the Rancho, and his fifth DeMille, The Ghost Breaker, opened in December. Johnston was also the male lead in one of the earliest movie serials, filmed in 1914 and released in mid-January 1915, Runaway June, which spotlighted, in the title role, Norma Phillips, whose short-lived nickname, during her brief (1913–17) film career, came from the appellation of her 1914 feature, Our Mutual Girl. Forty years old in 1916, Johnston enjoyed a brief period as a mature leading man, second-billed to such stars as the \\"Sweetheart of American Movies\\", Mabel Taliaferro, in God's Half Acre, and twenty-two-year-old Norma Talmadge in Fifty-Fifty, which cast him as her wealthy husband. By the end of the 1910s, however, his roles began to decrease in importance and he was back in fourth-, fifth- and sixth-billed supporting parts. In his final silent feature, 1928's Driftwood, he is fourth, playing, at age 52, third male support to leading lady Marceline Day. As talkies began, his roles declined to unbilled bit parts, with a single billing, in twenty- third place (as Jack W. Johnston), in the 1941 comedy-drama Buy Me That Town. There were two more appearances for Cecil B. DeMille, in 1939's Union Pacific and 1942's Reap the Wild Wind but, in contrast to his stature in 1914, Johnston, now in his sixties, is barely glimpsed in fleeting unbilled bits. The features containing the final three of those transient glimpses, 1946's Night and Day, Lady Luck, and The Locket were all released posthumously following his death in July. J. W. Johnston died in Los Angeles two months before his seventieth birthday, but the few obituaries which noted his passing gave his age as 70.J. W. Johnston obituary in Los Angeles Times (August 2, 1946, page 12) In a three-sentence notice, Variety, in its August 7, 1946 weekly issue, indicated that he died at 70 on August 1 (rather than the actual date of July 29) and that he \\"moved to Hollywood in 1912 and remained active until a few days before his death\\".

Background Black Cobain was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and fell in love with hip hop at an early age. His MC moniker \\"Black Cobain\\" originated from his childhood nickname \\"Black\\" being combined with \\"Cobain\\", in homage to his uncle who introduced him to rock and roll and the world-renowned band Nirvana, with frontman Kurt Cobain. Black Cobain attended Virginia State University, graduated magna cum laude, and obtained employment at the Boys & Girls Club, uncertain he could make a viable living and income from his ambitions as an emcee. During this time, he linked with long-time friend and mentor, Le'Greg O. Harrison, and under his direction began to professionalize his sound and actively exploit his talent through local performances, collaborations, sets, and freestyles. In 2009, Black signed to The Board Administration as their first official signee and shortly thereafter left full-time employment to fully pursue emceeing as a career.  Career  2008-2010 Black Cobain Young Gifted and Black Black Cobain performed the local circuit and various open mics within the DC, Maryland, and Virginia areas to garner attention and heighten awareness of his brand. Despite his affiliation with Wale and The Board Administration, he worked tirelessly to cultivate his own buzz and did not collaborate with Wale until years after signing with the label, because he put in his own groundwork and operates by his childhood reality and philosophy that nothing is ever given, more so earned. After a solid run releasing freestyles and frequenting local performance venues, Black Cobain released his debut mixtape, Now or Never. Now or Never focused on his transition into adulthood and the perils of inner city life. A year later, he released a second mixtape, Now, a demonstration of a more evolved emcee and better articulated and confident Black Cobain. Now had features from Wale, Raheem Devaughn, J.

Description The site incorporates a large area of contiguous mallee habitat. It overlaps the following protected areas, the Ngarkat Conservation Park in south-east South Australia and the Wyperfeld National Park and the Big Desert Wilderness Park in north-west Victoria, as well as several adjacent smaller reserves and state forests. The Victorian part of the site contains a chain of ephemeral lakes connected by Outlet Creek, the northern section of the Wimmera River. The lakes only fill when the river over-fills Lake Hindmarsh, to the south of Lake Albacutya which adjoins the site. Criteria for nomination as an IBA The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of malleefowl, black-eared miners, mallee emu-wrens, red-lored whistlers, regent parrots and purple-gaped honeyeaters. The IBA is also thought to support up to ten pairs of Australian bustards and western whipbirds, the latter being one of very few remaining inland populations of the eastern mallee subspecies P. n. leucogaster.

It was built between 1858 and 1861 and ran parallel to the Passaic River. It supplied hydropower and water for manufacturing. There was interest by some members of the business community to modify the canal to support navigational uses, but the canal was never used for that purpose. The Dundee Canal, along with the advent of railroads, stimulated rapid economic and population growth in Passaic and the surrounding area through the late 19th and early 20th century. Description The canal was about long. The Dundee Dam across the Passaic River was located at the north end of the canal, between Acquackanonk Township (present-day Clifton) and East Passaic (present- day Garfield), and it provided water for the canal. The dam was the lowest hydropower site built on the river, just above the tidal zone. History Founding and 19th century operations The Dundee Manufacturing Company (DMC), incorporated 1832, built the Dundee Dam across the Passaic River c. 1833, replacing an earlier wing dam it had built c. 1830. The dam was designed to supply water power to clothing mills in the area.Conservation Resources, Inc. (2010). \\"Dundee Park Riverfront Greenway: Historic Dundee Dam.\\" Accessed 2011-10-03. The company also built a deep, long canal c. 1833, adjacent to the site of the later Dundee Canal. It operated the short canal for a few years. In 1857 the New Jersey Legislature authorized the company to raise the water level of the dam, and this action flooded adjacent areas and created Dundee Lake. The flooding of various properties led to calls by area manufacturers and other community members to make the canal into a navigable waterway. This would have been an unusual combination of uses for a single canal. The DMC, which had reorganized in 1850, built the Dundee Canal between 1858 and 1861. This canal was not financially successful for navigation, and the company went into receivership in 1864. It reorganized as the Dundee Water Power and Land Company (DWPLC) in 1872, and the company's new emphasis on supplying water and selling land was more lucrative. The Dundee Canal's reliable water supply (both for power and manufacturing processes), and the availability of railroad service in the area (from branch lines that became part of the Erie Railroad) attracted manufacturing businesses to Passaic for the next several decades. The population in Passaic doubled between 1860 and 1880 (to 6,500). Several large textile mills were founded, including the Botany Worsted Mills, established in 1889. By 1900 the city population was 25,000. With increased urban development in the late 19th century, the canal water became dirtier and therefore less usable by the adjoining textile mills, but the water source was still useful for other industries, such as rubber and paper manufacturing, as well as for fire protection. 20th century Industrial use of the canal declined significantly during the Great Depression, and woolen manufacturing also declined. The canal continued to accumulate a large quantity of trash, and in the late 1930s the City of Passaic leased a portion of the canal, installed a culvert and paved it over, for parking lots and other public uses. After World War II ownership of the canal changed several times. A group of investors bought the DWPLC in 1946, and the company was sold to the Hackensack Water Company in 1974. Additional portions of the canal were filled in and paved over during the construction of New Jersey Route 21 beginning in the 1960s. Dundee Canal Industrial Historic District The Dundee Canal Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1999. The district comprises the canal and several former textile mills, including the Botany Worsted Mills; the Acquackanonk Water Company Site; and related structures.

Ending in victory for the Dutch, the war led to the fall of the Sultanate of Mataram and, indirectly, the founding of both the Sunanate of Surakarta and the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. After years of growing anti-Chinese sentiment, Dutch forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta) in October 1740, a group of survivors led by Khe Pandjang fled across the Sundra Strait, eventually heading east for Semarang on the island of Java. Despite being warned of the impending uprising, the head of the Dutch East India Company's military, Bartholomeus Visscher, ignored his advisers and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to tentatively support the Chinese while seemingly helping the Dutch. After the first casualties on 1 February 1741 in Pati, Chinese insurgents spread through central Java, joining forces with the Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting them. As the deception became increasingly obvious and the Chinese drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint Chinese and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order to eliminate all Chinese in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any Chinese he and his troops could find and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java. In late 1741, the siege around Semarang was broken as 's army fled once it became apparent that the Dutch, with their reinforcements, had superior firepower. The Dutch campaign throughout 1742 led to surrender and switch sides; as some Javanese princes wished to continue the war, on 6 April was disowned by the revolution and his nephew, Raden Mas Garendi, was chosen to be their sultan. As the Dutch recaptured cities through the northern coast of Java, the rebellion led an attack on 's capital at Kartosuro, forcing the Sunan to flee with his family. retook the city in December 1742, and by early 1743, the last Chinese had surrendered. After the war, the Dutch asserted greater control of Java through a treaty with .  Background  massacre of 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia was a major cause of the war. After a long period of repression by the Dutch colonial government, ethnic Chinese in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) revolted on 7 October 1740, killing fifty Dutch troops in Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) and Tanah Abang. This revolt was quashed by Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, who sent 1,800 troops, together with schutterij (militia) and eleven battalions of conscripts, to the two areas; they imposed a curfew on all Chinese inside the city walls to prevent them from plotting against the Dutch. When a group of 10,000 ethnic Chinese from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi was stopped at the gates the following day, Valckenier called an emergency meeting of the council for 9 October. The day of the meeting, the Dutch and other ethnic groups in Batavia began to kill all ethnic Chinese in the city, resulting in an estimated 10,000 deaths over two weeks. Towards the end of October 1740, survivors of the massacre, led by Khe Pandjang, attempted to flee to Banten but were blocked by 3,000 of its sultan's troops. The survivors then fled east, towards Semarang. Despite being warned of an imminent uprising by Chinese Lieutenant Que Yonko, the military commander for Java, Bartholomeus Visscher, dismissed the threat of the incoming Chinese. A minority in Java, the Chinese began forging alliances with the Javanese, who were the largest ethnic group on the island. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.  1741   Initial conflicts  On 1 February 1741, Corporal Claas Lutten was killed in his Pati home by a group of 37 Chinese insurgents armed with swords, spears, and harrows; the group then proceeded to loot his house. The insurgents were soon chased away by a group of Javanese soldiers under the command of the Regent of Kudus. Although most insurgents managed to escape, one was captured and killed, with his head being removed and staked on a pole in the middle of Semarang as a warning for other would-be insurgents. Meanwhile, in nearby Demak and Grobogan ethnic Chinese gathered in large assemblies and chose a new emperor, Singseh, and attempted to found their own nation. The success of the Javanese troops in stopping the insurgents reassured Visscher, despite Yonko's advice otherwise. At the time, Visscher and his troops, numbering 90 able-bodied Dutchmen and 208 Indonesians, were without reinforcements and received conflicting advice from Yonko and his uncle, Captain Que Anko. To secure his position, he sent a request to several local regents and leaders to capture or kill all suspicious looking Chinese; although some complied immediately, as evidenced by Visscher's receiving three heads several days later, others, such as Sunan of Mataram, were more cautious, writing that they were uncertain of the ethics of the orders. During a period of contemplation lasting from late 1740 and July 1741, and his advisers had been debating the possible benefits of joining the Chinese or holding out and rescuing the Dutch to gain a more favourable relationship. later secretly paid 2,000 real to Mas Ibrahim to begin attacks on the Dutch East India Company and its holdings; he also commanded his senior lords Jayaningrat and Citrasoma to be neutral in the conflict, and to let as many Chinese escape as possible. Mertopuro of Grobogan, one of the more vocal advocates of active resistance, was tasked with the instigation of Chinese in his area. Within 's capital at Kartosuro, he ordered the restoration of the siti inggil kidul (a kind of terrace) outside his court, thus giving him a reason to tell the Dutch that he had no manpower to spare. Despite Visscher receiving intelligence of 's dealings, he trusted the Sunan due to his previous loyalty to the company.  Instability of Visscher and early losses  When the Chinese forces, numbering up to 1,000 and threatening to cut supply lines to Semarang, arrived in Tanjung in April 1741, Visscher told the regent to deal with them; however, the regent's forces stalled, refusing to move until they received a tribute of high quality rice. After Yonko sent the rice, the regent's men went to Tanjung, stood with the rebels outside of their range, then fired and left. The rebels soon occupied a sugar mill there. In Grobogan, Mertopuro, armed with weapons from the Dutch military command, staged an attack on the Chinese rebels, in which the Javanese troops opened fire on the Chinese before the Dutch came. Once the Dutch arrived, Mertopuro showed bullet wounds in horses—inflicted by his own men—as proof that he had fought. To deal with the increasing pressure being put on by the Chinese, Visscher sent orders to company strongholds throughout the north coast to hire as many native, non-Javanese, mercenaries as could be found; he also ordered the regents of Pati, Jepara, Kudus, and Cekalsewu, then in Semarang for a military meeting, to send troops to cut off the insurgents' escape. The regents, loyal to , sent 540 troops to Tanjung, then secretly left for Kartosuro. However, when the troops arrived they feinted an attack, then pulled back to Semarang. When Visscher realised that the regents had disappeared, told him that he would send them back with a further 6,000 soldiers, requesting that Visscher secure compensation from the company headquarters in Batavia. News soon spread of thousands of Chinese joining forces with Javanese soldiers in Grobogan, outside of Semarang. On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing to deal with the uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking a table in half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage and scream to the residents of Semarang to escape while it was still possible. This continued until he crashed into the city walls. The residents ran away from Semarang in a panic, leaving eight loaded cannons outside the city walls. The following day, Visscher surrendered control of the military to Glan. Not long afterwards, news reached him that Yonko had not joined the insurgents but had been robbed, spending the night at his son's grave in Peterongan in depression. This revitalised Visscher, who retook command of the military on 4 May and ordered everyone to return to their homes. Several days afterwards, four regents – Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal – arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way. Despite being advised that he would be in danger if he went against the company, on 11 May requested that all coastal regents pledge their allegiance to him. He did the same for the members of his court on 13 May. However, several leaders, including second in line to the throne Prince Ngabehi Loringpasar, 's elder brother Prince Tepasana, and his mother Queen Amangkurat, were against a revolution; Captain Johannes van Velsen, Dutch resident in Kartasura, reported to Visscher that the Sunan had been persuaded against rebelling. However, became increasingly certain that he would join forces with the Chinese. On 23 May, the approximately 1,000 Chinese left Tanjung and headed east, assaulting the 15-man Juwana outpost, as well as the one in Rembang. Although the Dutch resident and five others escaped, the Dutch recorded a high number of casualties, with reports of cannibalism. The resident in Demak, hearing these rumours and with 3,000 Chinese outside the walls, requested permission to withdraw to Semarang. Considering Demak key to the defence of the city, Visscher refused, instead sending 80 to 100 native troops as reinforcements. The resident of Demak was eventually called back to Semarang, leaving the defence of the fort to Mertopuro. Rembang fell on 27 July, with Jepara falling four days later.  Siege of Semarang and Dutch losses  A map showing the situation in Semarang. The fort (center) was surrounded by Chinese and Javanese troops. The Chinese from Tanjung soon reached Semarang and laid siege, assisted by the troops previously sent to destroy them. Visscher, fearing that his troops would not be enough, requested reinforcements from . agreed to send an artillery unit, but it was secretly intended to reinforce the Chinese. With expeditions from the Chinese and Javanese reaching the city walls, in early June Visscher ordered a retaliatory expedition, totalling 46 Europeans and 146 Indonesians and assisted by Javanese troops under the Governor of Semarang Dipati Sastrawijaya. This expedition was sent against the Chinese and Javanese gathering outside the hills of Bergota. Outside the walls, the Javanese soon deserted after spoiling the available artillery provisions, with the other native groups abandoning the expedition upon first contact with the Chinese. After killing several Chinese, the Dutch soldiers returned to the fortress. The following day, the Dutch commandeered all Chinese houses, including that of Anko. When working weapons and ammunition were found in his home, Anko stated that they were remnants from an earlier war in 1718. Not believing Anko, the Dutch arrested him and Yanko, then had them chained and decapitated; Visscher then ordered the execution of all ethnic Chinese. On 14 June, Visscher ordered the Chinese quarters outside the fortress to be razed to the ground. Despite Chinese numerical superiority, they did not attempt a final attack. With more uprisings appearing in eastern Java, the company was approached by Prince of Madura, who offered to ally himself with the Dutch if they would support his bid to establish his own kingdom in the area; , formerly a great warrior for Mataram, had taken offence to being left out of 's earlier war deliberations and was ready to launch a war of his own against the Sunan's forces. After the Dutch agreed, severed his ties with Mataram, returning his wife ('s sister), to Kartosuro. Throughout June and July 's troops attempted to kill all ethnic Chinese, first starting in Madura then spreading to Tuban, Surabaya, Jipang, and Gresik. By 12 July, all Chinese in the Surabaya and Gresik areas had either escaped or been killed. On 9 July ordered the execution of Prince Tepasana and another younger brother, accused of being informants for Velsen; their families, including Tepasana's preteen son Raden Mas Garendi, were exiled. soon afterwards openly showed his support for the Chinese rebellion in July with a sneak attack. His troops entered the Dutch garrison in town, under the pretension of helping to prepare for a Chinese attack, on . Once inside, the Javanese soldiers opened fire, surprising the Dutch; despite being caught unaware and losing thirty-five men in the initial attack, the Dutch were able to hold out for three weeks. However, after the Chinese joined the battle, the garrison soon fell, with Velsen being executed and other surviving troops being given the choice (or forced) to convert to Islam or be killed. They circumcised the Dutch and the Javanese seized the Dutch children and women as booty after executing the Dutch leader. Meanwhile, Khe Pandjang's troops were driven out of Bekasi and joined with 1,000 soldiers under the command of Captain Ismail to capture Tegal. On 25 July, Visscher's replacement Abraham Roos—sent in late June because Visscher was considered mentally unstable—arrived in Semarang with 170 men, noting that the company only controlled the fortress, European quarters and beachhead. After Roos' arrival, the Dutch government began sending more reinforcements, eventually totalling at least 1,400 Dutch and 1,600 Indonesian soldiers. By November 1741, the company's fortress in Semarang was surrounded by 3,500 Chinese and 20,000 Javanese troops, who were armed with 30 cannons, as opposed to 3,400 Dutch and loyalist troops. With the superior Dutch firepower and tactics causing 's troops to scatter, the siege was eventually broken and an expedition was able to reclaim Jepara.  1742–1743   The fall of Kartosuro  In early 1742, capitulated to the Dutch. In March, a group of seven Dutchmen led by Captain Johan Andries, Baron van Hohendorff, arrived in Kartosuro to set the terms of his surrender. Although at first the Dutch demanded the young crown prince, Prince Loringpasar, the eldest son of Prince Notokusumo, and Prince Pringgalaya as hostages, Loringpasar was replaced by Queen Amangkurat as he was too ill to make the trip. Unwilling to let the Dutch take his son, Notokusumo, then laying siege to Semarang, made a fake attack against the Chinese, in which the sick or injured were sacrificed while the healthy were allowed to escape, in order to give an appearance of loyalty. He then went to Kartosuro to attempt to rescue his son, but was told to clear a path to Demak by the Dutch officials there. After stalling, Notokusumo agreed to do so, first travelling to Semarang. However, upon his arrival in Semarang he was arrested by the new chief of the army, Hugo Verijsel, with 's blessing. Verijsel then took 300 Dutch soldiers and 500 natives to clear the area around Kartosuro, but was stopped in Salatiga when he and his troops came under attack from the armies of three temenggung; Verijsel retreated to Ampel. For dealing with the Dutch, on 6 April was disowned by the still-fighting princes and Chinese insurgents. The rebellion leaders chose Garendi as the new sunan; Garendi took the name Sunan Kuning. On 19 June, it was reported that Notokusumo's troops, now under the command of Kyai Mas Yudanagara, had left for Kartosuro to place Sunan Kuning on the throne. On 30 June, they arrived at Kartosuro together with Khe Pandjang's troops and attacked the city. As 's troops, numbering close to 2,000, stayed behind to fight, , his family, and the Dutch escaped on horseback, finding safety after crossing the Solo River. then promised that he would surrender the coastal lands and let the Dutch pick the patih, or chief minister, if the Dutch would help him reclaim his throne.  Dutch control is restored  In early July, Verijsel received 360 Ambonese troops, led by Kraeng Tanate, to aid him in the defence of Semarang. On 21 July, Captain Gerrit Mom arrived from Sulawesi with 800 troops to serve as further reinforcements. Mom and Tanate were then sent to recapture Demak, occupied by 4,000 rebels under the command of the Chinese general Singseh and Javanese general Raden Suryakusuma. The ensuing battle took place over several days and resulted in a Dutch victory. The Dutch troops continued on to Kudus, where an estimated 2,000 Chinese soldiers were awaiting arrivals from Kartosuro. With their numbers reinforced by further troops led by Ngabehi Secanegara from Jepara and Captain Hendrik Brule from Semarang, Mom and Tanate recaptured the city without a fight on 28 August. After the recapture of Demak and Kudus, the remaining regents began to surrender, promised pardon by . The Chinese and Javanese rebel coalition, which was beginning to unravel, continued to hold Kartosuro until December 1742, being only chased out of the city when came and retook it. Although the Javanese were allowed to escape unmolested, the Chinese were only able to escape to nearby Prambanan after a \\"pitched battle\\" in Asem. Two months later the Chinese, accompanied by noted Javanese leader Pakunegara, made a last stand but were defeated and forced to run to the foothills along the southern coast. A general amnesty was soon declared, and Singseh surrendered in Surabaya.  Aftermath  Although was reinstated by the Dutch, in early 1743 he was forced to sign a treaty. Aside from moving his palace to nearby Solo, surrendered two of the Javanese leaders. As part of the conditions of the treaty, also surrendered the northern coast of Java, Madura, and eastern Java to the Dutch; the treaty also obligated him to pay 8,600 metric tons of rice in tribute every year and forbade the Javanese from sailing outside of Java, Madura, and Bali. died in 1749, an unpopular leader whose claim to the throne had only been held through the protection of the Dutch. Further disagreements between the court ministers and leaders after 's death led to the division of Mataram into two kingdoms, the Sunanate of Surakarta located in Solo under and the Sultanate of Yogyakarta in the city of the same name under Mangkubumi. Prince did not receive the land or powers promised, instead being isolated to Madura. Unwilling to accept what he saw as Dutch betrayal, he joined another rebellion in 1745; after his son surrendered to the Dutch, escaped to Banjarmasin in Borneo but was captured and exiled to the Cape of Good Hope in 1746. The Dutch East India Company, although it had gained a large amount of coastal land, was \\"in an advanced state of exhaustion\\". According to the noted scholar of Indonesia Merle Calvin Ricklefs, the new Sultan of Yogyakarta Mangkubumi went on to be the Dutch colonial government's \\"most dangerous enemy of the eighteenth century\\". The Indonesian Joko Widodo government and interior minister Tjahjo Kumolo erected a monument to the victims of the 1740 Batavia massacre and the Javanese and Chinese who fought against the Dutch in the Java war in revenge for the massacre.

The group consists of Benjamin “Ben” Mabry (vocals, guitar, rhodes, piano, glockenspiel, and harmonium) and Brent Holloman (guitar, vocals, banjo, rhodes, piano, glockenspiel, and bass). Stylistically, their music features an amalgam of folk, indie, chamber pop, rock and Americana influences. Recording history Seven Sisters Beta Radio's self-released debut Seven Sisters employs a combination of studio recorded material as well as home recorded tracks captured in guitarist Holloman's spare bedroom and living room. Seven Sisters was originally conceived as an EP, but when Mabry and Holloman left the studio in the winter of 2009, they had more songs than the typical EP, but less than a standard release. Out of money, they made the decision to record more material on their own, despite the fact that neither knew how to properly engineer or produce. By the following spring they had an additional four songs recorded in “Holloman’s house with borrowed equipment” and released the debut in April 2010. Much of the success Seven Sisters has achieved has come at a grassroots level and has largely built on exposure received from internet radio stations Spotify and Pandora Radio. Work in television and Seven Sisters deluxe release In 2011, two Beta Radio songs were featured on the first two episodes of the American medical-drama television series Hart of Dixie. The songs were written after the band was approached by the producers of the show who were looking for two waltzes that actress Jaime King and others would perform to on screen. The band also appeared on screen performing in the pilot episode with Holloman's wife Amanda and friend David Pray backing. The two waltzes were subsequently included in a 2011 special edition vinyl release of Seven Sisters. Colony of Bees On November 18, 2014, Beta Radio released Colony of Bees, a record that was recorded over a span of two years and made in multiple recording studios. The songs on Colony of Bees show a subtle stylistic departure from their previous work, they are more expansive and layered, as opposed to the more minimalistic arrangements found on Seven Sisters. The fuller sound featured on Colony of Bees is due in part to the lengthier recording period and accomplished personnel appearing on the record. Of note is composer/arranger/violinist Rob Moose (Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver, Ben Folds, Arcade Fire). In February 2015, online news aggregator Huffington Post called Colony of Bees \\"sonically lovely.\\" The record was included in the site's top ten roundup of its 40 \\"Best Albums of 2014.\\" The Songs the Season Brings, Vols. 1-4 Starting in 2011, the band released a series of four holiday EPs entitled, The Songs the Season Brings, Vol.1 (2011), Vol.2 (2012), Vol.3 (2013) & Vol.4 (2015). These releases are \\"a collection of classic and original Christmas songs to help celebrate the holiday season [and were] made in various environments over the two months before Christmas - recorded in the studio, at home in bedrooms, and in closets of family members.” Every year, the EPs were given away for free via their official Bandcamp and NoiseTrade sites and in 2015, were compiled together into one full-length album.

Eunicea sp. Holaxonia is a suborder of soft corals, a member of the phylum Cnidaria.Holaxonia World Register of Marine Species. Retrieved 2011-12-03. Members of this suborder are sometimes known as gorgonians and include the sea blades, the sea fans, the sea rods and the sea whips. These soft corals are colonial, sessile organisms and are generally tree-like in structure. They do not have a hard skeleton composed of calcium carbonate but have a firm but pliable, central axial skeleton composed of a fibrous protein called gorgonin embedded in a tissue matrix, the coenenchyme. In some genera this is permeated with a calcareous substance in the form of fused spicules. Members of this suborder are characterized by having an unspiculated axis and often a soft, chambered central core.Suborder Holaxonia Guide to the Shallow Water (0-200 m) Octocorals of the South Atlantic Bight.
