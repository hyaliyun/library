It was the basis of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC); still it is customary to use the expressions \\"Falange\\" and \\"Falangista\\" to refer to members and activities of the Christian Democrats and the same party, respectively.  History  In 1935 a group of younger social- Christians split from the Conservative Party to form the National Falange. Despite its name this group was largely made up of progressive and reformist Catholics, and bore little resemblance to Spanish Falangism. In its early years it imitated elements of fascist movements with some of its members wearing uniforms and undergoing paramilitary training. With its progressive economic program (creating an alternative to capitalism, \\"redeeming\\" the proletariat) it was in open conflict with the Catholic high clergy who accused it of disrespecting the Church's leadership and siding with communists. Despite its aim to be a centrist alternative to the left and the right, and relatively great public attention, it never received more than 4 percent of the votes. Later it supported the administration of Juan Antonio R√≠os (1942‚Äì46) and in 1957 merged with the Social Christian Conservative Party into the Christian Democratic Party.A.

Committee of 5,000 controversy In early 1921, Pinkett became the focus of a controversy in Omaha. In part, the controversy arose when he sued pastor W C Williams of St. John AME Church (where Pinkett had been a member) over financial irregularities when the church built a factory for the employment of the women in the church.\\"Pastor Says Pinkett Charge 'Spite Work'\\". Omaha World Herald. Thursday, January 6, 1921. page 4 At nearly the same time, Pinkett hired George Wells Parker to be editor of the newspaper \\"The New Era\\", a paper Pinkett paid to produce. When the pair disagreed over the contents of the paper, Parker created a new paper, \\"The Omaha Whip\\" which managed two editions before closing. Parker accused Pinket and two other men, Ole Jackson and Johnny Moore, of promising to give the black vote to police superintendent Dean Ringer. The accusations included that the police look the other way while Moore, who had recently been released from prison, and Jackson sold \\"anything they want to sell\\".\\"Pinkett-Ringer- Jackson-Moore Combine Works Overtime Again\\", The Mediator, Omaha Nebraska, March 31, 1921, page 1. Further, Parker accused Pinkett of association with the supporters of the Ku-Klux-Klan and called on Omahan's to stand by the campaigns of Mayor James C. Dahlman and his party.\\"Why the Whip was Discontinued\\". Omaha World Herald. Thursday, March 24, 1921. page 8 Williams preached in support of Parker and against what he believed was police protection of these joints and called black candidate for police commissioner John T. McDonald, Sr to state his position. Williams also associated his opponents with a group called the \\"committee of 5,000\\" which he claimed consisted of the ministers and members of white Protestant churches in Omaha who campaigned against Jews, Catholics, and blacks in the city and supposedly had KKK ties\\"Says More Joints are Running than Ever\\". Omaha World Herald. Monday, April 4, 1921. page 1 Law and civil rights work The Omaha NAACP was founded in 1918 after Mary White Ovington spoke in Omaha and after the end of World War I was led by Pinkett and Father John Albert Williams. W. E. B. Du Bois came and spoke to the group in May 1919 and Mayor Edward P. Smith was in attendance. An important cause of the violence throughout 1919 were cases of police or media sensationalize of crimes perpetrated by blacks and the resulting anger and violence of whites. When the paper, the Omaha Bee, ran such a story, the Omaha NAACP organized a rally in protest of over 600 people. Another report in the Bee of a rape allegation against Willy Brown in September 1919 is often considered the instigation of violence by a mob of whites culmination in the lynching of Willy Brown and followed by more rioting and violence. Among others, Williams and Pinkett worked to bring peace in the city.\\"Race Propaganda\\". Omaha World Herald. Thursday, November 6, 1919. page 12 Pinkett would later blame the riots on the Dennison machine as an action in support of Dahlman and against Smith for Mayor.Orville D Menard, \\"Lest We Forget: The Lynching of Will Brown, Omaha's 1919 Race Riot,\\" Nebraska History 91 (2010): 152-165. In a similar indecent seven years later, Pinkett played another important role. Blacks living in North Platte faced mob violence and fled the city after a police officer was killed on July 15, 1926. Pinkett, John Andrew Singleton, and E W Killingsworth petitioned the governor to step in and worked closely with the governor in reducing tension and allowing the people to return to their homes.The accused man, who was black, was found dead that same day, either by suicide or killed by the police. \\"Sorenson Predicts Early 'Mob Arrests'\\". Omaha World Herald, July 16, 1929. page: 2 In the case of street violence, Pinkett supported increased policing both of blacks and whites. Pinkett also protested what he felt was inequal enforcement and police harassment of blacks and black owned businesses. In 1922, he served as the attorney for Robert H. Johnson, who he felt was a victim of a different kind of police abuse. Johnson was a political agitator who supported M. L. Endes for police commissioner and who was arrested and held in jail the week of the election. Pinkett claimed in court that Johnson's right of habeas corpus was illegally taken and the acts of the police were in retaliation for Johnson's politics.\\"Charge Plot to Drive Endes Man from City\\".

Omaha World Herald. Friday, July 17, 1925. page 11 Indeed, the vehemence of his positions was not without cost. On October 26, 1927, Picket was attacked by a man brandishing a pistol in response to his work with Reverend John Grant of St. John's AME against gambling.\\"Thinks Gamblers Hired Man who Attacked Him\\".

This building is now a gym. In 1954 it was decided to build a new, bigger church, the present St Joseph's Church, at the junction of Church Road and St Mary's Road. The Foundation Stone was blessed on 8 November 1954, and on the 29 July 1956 the then Archbishop John Charles McQuaid blessed and officially opened the new Church of St Joseph in East Wall. Changes and development St Joseph's church has seen significant changes since it was built. Many of these changes are reflected in work that has been carried out on the church building over the years. The Sanctuary was reordered. This enables the priest to celebrate Mass facing the people.

Due to several rare plants in a diverse range of habitats, it was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1951. Geography Chyenhal Moor is a poorly drained shallow valley in the parish of Paul, on the southern side of the Land's End peninsula. The small stream draining the moor flows to Kerris Moor and reaches the sea at Lamorna Cove. The underlying rock is coarsely porphyritic granite and the soils are mostly humic, gleys, covered with varying depths of peat. History Until the early 19th-century rough-ground such as Chyenhal Moor was an important part of rural economy through the grazing of livestock and cutting of furze (gorse) for fuel. Moorland usually refers to uncultivated land on a hill, but locally it is also applied to wetlands such as this, and the nearby Kerris and Clodgy Moors. The high rainfall, poor drainage and acid conditons inhibit the action of bacteria which break down plant material resulting in the accumulation of a dark brown, fibrous material known as peat. Chyenhal Moor has been a well known location for botany since John Ralfs (1807‚àí1890) found rare plants here. Wildlife and ecology The moor was notified as a SSSI because of the diverse range of habitats and rare plants. Willow carr is the dominant habitat, is often dense and reaches a maximum height of 5 m. It is dominated by grey willow (Salix cinerea) with some goat willow (Salix caprea) and ground flora includes lesser spearwort (Ranunculus flammula), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), soft rush (Juncus effusus) and yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus). Within the willow are small patches of wet heath vegetation with Cornish moneywort (Sibthorpia europaea}, wavy-leaved St John's wort (Hypericum undulatum) and ivy-leaved bellflower. In the wetter parts are creeping forget- me-knot (Omphalodes verna), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), purple moorgrass (Molinia caerulea) and various species of moss including sphagnums. A species of note in the south-west corner of the site is pillwort (Pilularia globulifera), a rare fern of wet heathland and acid pools. Plants surrounding the pool include bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella), marsh St John's wort (Hypericum elodes), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), ragged robin (Silene flos-cuculi), scaly male-fern (Dryopteris affinis) and water mint (Mentha aquatica). A second, overgrown pond, in the south-east corner of the site has the rare unbranched bur-reed (Sparganium emersum), and a species very rare in Cornwall ivy-leaved duckweed (Hesperocodon hederaceus). In the more open wet heathy habitats heath spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), glaucous sedge (Carex flacca) and star sedge (Carex echinata) are found. Seven species of dragonfly have been recorded including the broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa) and the four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). In the north of the site is an open-heathy area dominated by common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). The rare Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris) was planted here in 1934. Culture Chyenhal Moor was the subject of paintings by two Newlyn School artists, Stanhope Forbes and Harold Harvey. Harvey's depicts the winter cutting of furze (gorse) on the moor.

Formerly, it was classified in the oogenus Paraspheroolithus; however, it was considered sufficiently different to be classified in its own genus. C. shizuiwanensis is similar to Stalicoolithus, leading to their classification in the same family, Stalicoolithidae.Wang Q, Wang X L, Zhao Z K, and Jiang Y G. (2012). \\"A new oofamily of dinosaur egg from the Upper Cretaceous of Tiantai Basin, Zhejiang Province, and its mechanism of eggshell formation\\" Chinese Science Bulletin. 57: 3740-3747. doi: 10.1007/s11434-012-5353-2 History Xixia County was first excavated for fossils by a Geological Team of the Henan Geological Bureau in 1974. Fossils continued to be excavated there, but were not extensively studied until 1994 when Fang et al. received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Under this sponsorship, with support of the Geological Profession Foundation and the Geological Science Item Foundation of MGMR, a multidisciplinary team of Chinese paleontologists took on the task of analyzing the geology and paleontology of these eggs. In 1998, Fang et al. described numerous new ootaxa, including the oospecies \\"Paraspheroolithus\\" shizuiwanensis. Further specimens were uncovered in Tiantai in 2000; these were referred to \\"P.\\" cf. shizuiensis. In 2012 multiple complete and near-complete eggs were discovered in Tiantai by the Chinese paleontologists Wang Qiang, Wang Xiaolin, Zhao Zikui, and Jiang Yan'gen. They named a new oogenus, Coralloidoolithus, for P. shizuiwanensis, and referred several of their newly discovered specimens to C. shizuiwanensis. They also synonymized this oospecies with the Mongolian Dendroolithus microporosus and Spheroolithus oosp. from South Korea based on similarities in microstructure. Description The first specimens discovered were only fragments, but based on impressions they were estimated to be in diameter. The complete eggs discovered in Tiantai are larger, ranging from in length by wide. They are roughly spherical. Wang et al. (2012) described them as having a rough surface, but the original \\"P.\\" shizuiwanensis specimens were noted by Fang et al. to have a smooth surface. Dendroolithus macroporosus and the Spheroolithus specimens referred to C. shizuiwanensis are also smooth- shelled. Coralloidoolithus shell is typically about 2.6 mm thick. It has similar microstructures to the other stalicoolithids; it has a very thin cone layer (the inner layer of the eggshell), making up only about 1/10 of the eggshell's thickness, and its columnar layer is divided into three zones. Secondary shell units make up the outermost of these zones and also fill many of the pore canals. The middle zone is characterized by light and dark bands and the innermost zone of the columnar layer has horizontal growth lines. Its pores are irregular and meandering. Coralloidoolithus can be distinguished from Stalicoolithus by having a thinner eggshell and by having fewer secondary shell units. Shixingoolithus is larger than Coralloidoolithus and has a thicker cone layer. Distribution Coralloidoolithus shizuiwanensis is found at several Upper Cretaceous sites, including at the Sangping Formation in Xixia County, Henan and at the Chichengshan Formation Tiantai County, Zhejiang. Also, specimens found in the Gobi Desert and in Bosung County, Chullanam-do Province, South Korea have been referred to this oospecies. Classification Coralloidoolithus is a monotypic oogenus containing only C. shizuiwanensis. It is classified alongside Stalicoolithus and Shixingoolithus in the oofamily Stalicoolithidae.

The inscription mentioned and honored the commendable deed of the people of Anjuk Ladang village on assisting Pu Sindok on repelling the invading Malay king in the year 937 CE. Thus King Pu Sindok has erected a monument of victory (jayastambha) to commemorate this heroic event. This inscription is also called Candi Lor inscription because it was found near the ruins of Candi Lor temple, in Candirejo village, Loceret, Nganjuk Regency, a few kilometers southeast of modern Nganjuk city, East Java. The name \\"Anjuk Ladang\\" refer to the place mentioned in this inscription, and then associated with the origin of Nganjuk Regency, since this inscription contains the first mention of its current toponym. Content Some parts of this inscription ‚Äî especially at the top of the inscription, has eroded and could not be read entirely. Several readable lines states that King Pu Sindok has ordered the rice paddies of kakatikan (?) in Anjukladang to be made as Sima land, and offered to Bathara in hyang prasada kabhaktyan in Sri Jayamerta, as a dharma (dedication) of the Samgat of Anjukladang. Sima land is rice-cultivated land recognized through royal edict, with its yield available for taxation or other purposes, in this case its yield was free from taxation and used to fund a temple instead. According to J.G. de Casparis, the villagers of Anjuk Ladang was awarded for their service and merit on assisting the king's army ‚Äî under the leadership of Pu Sindok, to repel the invading Malayu (Sumatran, highly possible referring Srivijaya) army that tried to approach the capital and has reached the area near Nganjuk. For this extraordinary service, Pu Sindok later would ascend to the throne of Medang kingdom. In addition, the inscription also contains the information on the existence of a sacred building. According to de Casparis in his paper Some Notes on Transfer of Capitals in Ancient Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, the inscription mentioned that King Pu Sindok has erected a monument of victory (jayastambha) after successfully repelled the invading Malay king, and in the year 937 CE, the monument was replaced by a temple.

It is part of the second belt of fortifications around Lyon, which also includes Fort de Vancia, Fort de Feyzin and Fort du Mont Verdun.  History  Its history is linked to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Indeed, as a result of the Treaty of Frankfurt which ended the 1870 war, France lost Alsace and Lorraine, reducing its borders. To ensure the defence of Lyon, it built a strong cordon of forts encircling the city to the east, which included the forts of Bron, Vancia, Feyzin and Mont Verdun. These forts were equipped with significant amounts of artillery with all the hardware, staff, and powder storage that this then entailed. When a defensive reorganization occurred in France in 1874, the commune of Bron was therefore included in the crown of detached forts, to protect the stronghold of Lyon. From 1875 to 1885, the following were built successively around the town: * Fort de Bron, placed on the heights above the Rhone valley, covering as far as Saint-Priest; * Batteries at Lessivas and Parilly; * A walled enclosure with four bastions. The Fort de Bron is the only one remaining. Fort de Bron was completed with two annexed batteries at Lessivas and Parilly. But advances in artillery quickly made these forts, and therefore that of Bron, ineffective, inadequate and unable to defend Lyon. During World War I, which did not see fighting in this region, the fort was used only as a barracks and equipment warehouse. During the Second World War the Germans used it as a prison. The French army used it until 1962 as an annex of the air base; it was decommissioned in 1963.  Characteristics  File:Ravelin fort de Bron.JPGRavelin protecting the entrance.

File:Pompe √† eau Fort de Bron.JPGWater pump. = Role = The establishment of this fort allowed the City of Lyon to protect itself from enemy attacks from the east, dominating the surrounding plain, the fort covered D√©cines, Chassieu and Saint-Priest. = Location = The fort is located at shooting distance by antique cannon from Lyon (i.e. 7 to 8 km), at 212 metres above sea level on a hill at Bron. = Composition = This polygonal structure is surrounded by a deep moat six to eight metres deep and twelve to fourteen metres wide, defended by caponiers. The buildings (some underground) of the 1,500 m¬≤ site could accommodate 841 men in war. The bridge that allows access to the rear entrance of the fort is unique: it retracts sideways, sliding on steel rollers. = Land and zones = A judgement of expropriation dating from 10 June 1874 released 24 hectares for the construction of the fort. Like other forts, military land was bounded by stone posts located around it, their hats on an engraving showing the direction of the next point. = Armament = The fort, whose cannons can reach targets located 6 km away (with an extended range up to 8 km, in 1880, with the new Bange guns), was equipped with: * 17 guns on the cavalier, * 13 guns on the lower enclosure, * 10 light guns to defend the moats, * 5 mortars, **a total of 45 pieces of artillery. = Garrison and housing = 841 people were housed in wartime: * 1 commander of the fort, * 17 officers, * 39 NCOs, * 784 soldiers. Ten horses were also present on the site. Officers and NCOs were housed in the second floor barracks, upstairs. The rest of the men occupied the first floor of the barracks at a rate of 56 soldiers to a room. The fort was also equipped with two kitchens, a bakery, a well, a cistern, latrines, a forge and shops. * The bakery required 69,400 kg flour in reserve. * A pump drew drinking water from a depth of 37 metres in the water table at a rate of 50 m¬≥ per day, also feeding a tank containing 13 m¬≥. This was intended to provide water in the event of pump failure during three days. * Lighting was by kerosene lamps, candles and skylights . Disciplinary premises were also placed in the centre of the fort, including a guard room and four cells.  Construction  The order was given on 8 May 1874 by General Cissey of the Ministry of War, to begin construction of the Fort of Bron. The stone came from Trept and from the Monts d'Or, a small mountain range to the northwest of Lyon. Construction began in 1875 and continued until 1877 for a total cost of 3,014,578 francs: * 760,000 francs in 1875, * 1,230,000 francs in 1876, * 745,000 francs in 1877, * 19,000 francs in 1878, and * 260,578 francs for acquisition costs.  Today  The greater Lyon council bought the fort in 1975 to build two water tanks, occupying 50% of the built area of the fort and 300 metres of a South divide as a spillway for security. On 23 September 1976 at the Extra-Municipal Planning Commission (CEMU), the COURLY proposed to transform the ditches to public landfill, to abandon the rubble, and to finally abort the project. The army still retained 6 hectares of woodland (including some of ditches and the Diamond gap) in order to build an extension of the Army medical school. Several attempts to negotiate with the army to retain all the fort intact failed, so an agreement was signed between the mayor of Bron, Andr√© Sousi, and the Prime Minister, Raymond Barre, proposing the purchase of the land totalling 9,878 m¬≤) by the municipality at the price of 10 francs per m¬≤, i.e. 98,780 francs. The purchase allowed the creation in 1983 of a fitness trail around the fort. The Fort de Bron hosts a theatrical event every two years: the Biennial du Fort de Bron; for two months, a theatre company takes possession of the premises. In 2009, The Odyssey of Homer drew nearly 17,000 spectators 15,000 in 2011. The Fort de Bron is managed by an association created March 25, 1982, which organises free tours on the first Sunday of each month. The association also participates in Heritage Days and organizes a craft exhibition in early October. A museum has also been built there. The museum Soci√©t√© Lyonnaise History of Aviation and Aerospace Documentation is installed in three rooms of the barracks on the second floor. The fort has also been used as a filming location for video clips, movie scenes or interviews. (in French). The TV movie The gate of heaven by Denys Granier- Deferre, broadcast 1993, and Under guard, the TV movie Luc Beraud, broadcast in 2002, and the short films Masquerade from Nicolas Brossette, broadcast 2007, and The d√©carquilleurs from Jean-Paul Lebesson were partly shot at the fort.

Early life  Correia was born in Cernache do Bonjardim, a former civil parish in the municipality of Sert√£, central Portugal. Upon emigrating to the USA with his family, he raced competitively until the age of 21, including three appearances at the UCI Juniors World Championships. Correia raced for Portuguese Continental team Troiamariscos in 1995, after which he turned down the possibility of a professional cycling career in favour of attending Fordham University in New York. After graduating, a career in publishing brought him around the world, working for titles such as Esquire before becoming associate publisher of Bicycling magazine.  Return to racing  Following a conversation with Fausto Pinarello, the owner of the renowned bike brand set up by his father, Jo√£o decided to return to racing aged 32, losing more than 60 pounds in the process. His unique story and his performances with US Continental Bissell Pro Cycling Team led to much media interest and an eventual contract with Cerv√©lo TestTeam, where he rode alongside high-profile stars like 2010 world champion Thor Hushovd and the 2008 Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre.  Post-racing career  Upon the closure of the Cerv√©lo team, Jo√£o went back to the business world, working for LinkedIn before returning again to cycling, combining his passion for the sport with his business skills to set up two successful companies: inGamba Tours, a travel company specialising in cycling, and Corso Sports Marketing, in partnership with his friend and business partner Ken Sommer. Their agency represents some of the most exciting talent in professional cycling, including the likes of Michael Valgren, winner of the 2018 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Amstel Gold Race, Team Sky rider Tao Geoghegan Hart, and Dutch veteran Laurens ten Dam. Aside from his business interests, Correia is also a supporter of World Bicycle Relief, an international non- profit organization based in Chicago that specializes in large-scale, comprehensive bicycle distribution programs to aid poverty relief in developing countries around the world. Their programs focus primarily on education, economic development, and health care. To date, his company inGamba Tours has raised more than $1 million for the WBR cause.

He was sometimes referred to as \\"The Italian Van Gogh\\".\\"Tuscany's Other Puccini\\" @ Magenta (Florence). Biography His father was a baker. He worked in his father's bakery and sketched as a hobby until his talent was noticed by Giovanni Fattori, who encouraged him to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence, which he did, against parental objections, in 1884 when he was only fifteen.Brief biography @ the Galleria Athena. While there, he studied with Fattori and was influenced by the works of Silvestro Lega. Metalworks (\\"La Metallurgica\\") After graduating, he returned to Livorno and continued his studies at the \\"Scuola Libera del Nudo\\". In 1893, his family had him committed to a psychiatric hospital in Siena, citing depression and persecution mania as the justification. This condition may have been brought about by the infidelity of a woman he loved, or perhaps his family simply found him too temperamental to handle, but the experience produced a major change in his artistic style. He abandoned the realistic style of the Macchiaioli in favor of broad strokes and brighter colors; developing his own version of Divisionism. This combination of style and mental illness earned him his nickname: \\"The Van Gogh of Livorno\\" (later, \\"Italy\\"). Financially unsuccessful and impoverished, he worked as a waiter, created designs for embroiderers and milliners, made signs and sold the occasional painting. In 1911, he went to France for a year, living near his brother in Digne-les-Bains. While there, he painted maritime subjects and undertook to study the works of Paul C√©zanne. When he returned to Livorno, he became an habitu√© of the Caff√® Bardi (modeled after the Caff√® Michelangiolo in Florence) which, since 1908, had served as a meeting place for the city's young artists; mostly from the generation after Puccini's. He began to exhibit and, by 1914, could earn his living entirely from his paintings. Pasture in Maremma At the age of fifty, after a brief hospitalization, he died from a neglected lung infection, aggravated by the long hours he spent outdoors, painting in Maremma. His unexpected death, just as he was beginning to be appreciated, caused great sorrow among his friends at the Caff√® Bardi. A month later, fifteen of them met at the studios of Gino Romiti and established the \\"\\" (Leghorn Group) to honor his achievements, promote the artists of Livorno, and have Puccini's body interred in the memorial chapel near the Sanctuary of Montenero.\\"La Fondazione\\" @ the Gruppo Labronico website. This process was stalled, for bureaucratic reasons, but the group persisted and his remains were finally placed there in 1988. In 1949, a street in Quercianella was named after him.

Playing career Burns began his footballing career with local boys club Troon Thistle, and also spent time playing with Prestwick Boys Club & Coylton Boys Club, before joining Ayr United Boys Club. He was scouted by several senior teams and trained with Motherwell, Dundee United, Hearts and Celtic before deciding to sign 'S' forms with Ayr United under Manager George Burley. He left Marr College at 16 to sign a 2-year YTS contract at Somerset Park with Manager Simon Stainrod, before signing his first professional contract at Ayr United at the age of 18. =Ayr United= \\"Burnsie\\" began his professional career with his local senior club Ayr United in July 1995 and made an early impact when he made his first team debut at the age of 17 against Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park. He didn't have to wait long for his first start either, which came at Somerset Park against Raith Rovers when he was just 18. In 1997, along with fellow starlets Keith Hogg, Neil Scally, Gareth \\"Bo\\" Armstrong and Joe Carruth, he enjoyed a spell on loan at Glenafton Athletic under Alan Rough which prepared him for the rough and tumble of Scottish football. Next season, in February 1998, he was thrown in at the deep end by manager Gordon Dalziel as a versatile youngster in an Ayrshire derby match against Kilmarnock at Somerset Park, with the home side recording a famous 2-0 victory courtesy of an 83rd minute headed goal from Jim Dick & a beautiful lob from Ian Ferguson over the head of Killie keeper Gordon Marshall. A period of vast investment in the playing squad at Ayr from millionaire Chairman Bill Barr saw the arrivals of high-calibre players such as Neil Duffy, Pat McGinlay, Eddie Annand, John Hughes, James Grady, Andy Walker, Glynn Hurst and Gary Teale. This left youngsters like Burns sidelined, and in 1999 he was signed by legendary Manager John Lambie (footballer, born 1941) for Partick Thistle on loan with a view to a permanent move. He made 6 appearances in an impressive spell, but chances of a permanent move were scuppered when Ayr demanded a transfer fee and he was recalled to Somerset Park. Burns enjoyed a brief spell at his hometown club Troon F.C. under Manager John Redmond during his rehabilitation from injury in 2000. After making 28 league appearances for the club, he was released in December 2001 seeking regular first-team football. =Queen of the South= Burns was signed for Queen of the South by Manager John Connolly (Scottish footballer) in December 2001 to supplement a title-chasing squad. The club won the 2001‚Äì02 Scottish Second Division, finishing 8 points clear of Alloa Athletic in 2nd place, but it was a frustrating period for Burns who only made a solitary appearance. =Peterhead= After completing a pre-season campaign with Forfar Athletic in the summer of 2002, Manager Neil Cooper decided against signing Burns permanently, but recommended him to Peterhead Manager Ian Wilson who was delighted to sign him up for the 2002-03 season. This was a hugely enjoyable season for Burns, as he was an integral part of the team who were chasing the Balmoor side's first ever promotion, with the season ending in spectacular fashion as an incredible four sides went into the final day chasing the title. A 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Greenock Morton at a packed Cappielow saw Morton crowned champions and East Fife narrowly pip Peterhead to promotion. Despite enjoying being a first team regular, the travelling from Burns' home in Troon to Peterhead was taking its toll and Burns rejected the offer of a new contract with the club in search for something closer to home. =Kilwinning Rangers= Burns joined the all-conquering Buffs side in July 2003, becoming a key member of the side that went on to win the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division in season 2003-04. The departure of the Management team led by Mark Shanks sparked a remarkable change of fortunes which saw the Abbey Park side relegated the following season to the West of Scotland Super League First Division under new manager Paul Wright. Burns rejected the offer of a new contract in order to concentrate on a new career, and left Abbey park in the summer of 2005. =Troon= After 2 years out of the game due to work demands, Burns signed for his home-town team Troon in June 2007. Signed by Manager Michael O'Neill, it wasn't long before Burnsie was named Club Captain as he enjoyed some of the best years of his career at Portland Park. Niggling injuries and work commitments forced an early retirement from playing at the age of 31, although returning Manager John Redmond was keen to utilise Burns's knowledge in a coaching capacity. Coaching career After serving on the coaching staff under John Redmond following his retirement from playing, Burns formed part of the new management team with Jimmy Kirkwood when Redmond stepped down in March 2011 and the two oversaw a dramatic overhaul of the club and the playing staff with an emphasis on youth development & attractive football. Results were erratic to begin with, but the improvement was remarkable and a title push was well underway in season 2011-12 with the team narrowly missing out on the second promotion spot by one point. The club went one better in 2012-13, securing second place with weeks to spare after a season long title battle with Kilwinning Rangers and promotion back to the Super League was assured. Season 2013-14 saw unprecedented success, as the club were crowned the Super League First Division Champions, Ayrshire Cup winners and were also West of Scotland Cup finalists. Burns became manager of Troon in the summer of 2015, after Jimmy Kirkwood stepped aside due to work pressures, and he led them to their highest ever league finish in his first season in charge as well as an appearance in the Final of the Ardagh Cup. Following the club's relegation from the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division, Burns stood down in May 2017 after 10 years at the club to spend more time with his family.

The series, distributed through Norton Records, helped reveal relatively unknown recordings by groups originating from Fort Worth that were previously made available to only a handful of collectors. In total, three albums were released in relation to the series in 2004. The Fort Worth teen scene emerged from the wake of the British Invasion, with nearly all the bands from the region tended to take influence from the harder-edged R&B; and blues rock music of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. These two musical acts' styles were emulated throughout the series on \\"one-take\\" recordings, which also mixed in a sizable share of cover versions such as two different interpretations of \\"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\\" and \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\". Typical of most garage rock musical artists of the era, Fort Worth's scene was formed by developing teenage musicians, sharing the primitive and raw sound of groups featured on the Pebbles series. For the most part, the bands were extremely popular within Fort Worth, but hardly became noticed outside the region, granted the limited national exposure of \\"Night of the Sadist\\" by Larry and the Blue Notes. Along with the albums' liner notes, a film called Teen A-Go-Go was created by music historians Mellissa Kirkendall and Mark A. Nobles, and released to correspond with the series. It goes into detail about the music scene through the use of rare photos, archival footage, and multiple interviews with surviving members of some of the Fort Worth-based bands. Series co-creator Larry Harrison characterized the scene as \\"a hotbed of garage band activity with its own infrastructure. There were teen clubs, like the Box, the Candy Stick, the legendary after-hours Cellar, the Jolly Time Teen Hop, and a multitude of converted skating rinks and rec centers with ‚ÄúA-Go-Go‚Äù appended to their names, where kids flocked by the hundreds every weekend to cheer on their local heroes in battles of the bands\\".

The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, champions of the Pacific League, played the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, champions of the Central League. The Hawks were the defending Japan Series champions, having beaten the Hanshin Tigers in 2014. The series was sponsored by the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and was officially known as the 2015 SMBC Nippon Series. The Hawks defeated the Swallows in five games. Lee Dae-ho won the Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award. Kenji Akashi, Shota Takeda, and Rick van den Hurk (all of the Hawks) won outstanding player awards, while Tetsuto Yamada of the Swallows won the Fighting Spirit Award. Climax Series Summary Series notes This was the fourth time in Japan Series history that two rookie managers met, with Mitsuru Manaka managing Yakult and Kimiyasu Kudoh managing SoftBank. The other occurrences were in 1986 (Masaaki Mori for the Seibu Lions and Junro Anan for the Hiroshima Carp), 2002 (Tatsunori Hara for the Yomiuri Giants and Haruki Ihara for Seibu) and 2004 (Tsutomu Ito for Seibu and Hiromitsu Ochiai for the Chunichi Dragons). In addition, Manaka is the first rookie manager of a Central League team to qualify for the Japan Series through the Climax Series playoff system.SoftBank's Kudoh is the 5th rookie manager to win the Pacific League Climax Series. Tsutomu Ito (2004) and Hisanobu Watanabe (2008) of the Seibu Lions, Norifumi Nishimura of the Chiba Lotte Marines (2010) and Hideki Kuriyama of the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters (2012) have all been successful rookie managers since the Pacific League introduced a post-season playoff series in 2004. The Central League introduced a playoff series in 2007, which is when the name \\"Climax Series\\" was adopted. Yakult won the Central League pennant and defeated the Yomiuri Giants in the Central League Climax Series, making this their first Japan Series appearance since 2001, when they defeated the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes four games to one. The defending champion Hawks won the Pacific League pennant and defeated the Chiba Lotte Marines in the Pacific League Climax Series. Game summaries =Game 1= The Hawks played the series without Seiichi Uchikawa, who suffered broken ribs in the Climax Series. Before the start of the game, Seiichi Uchikawa, the Hawks' cleanup hitter, was ruled out for the Japan Series due to broken ribs suffered during the Climax Series victory. Shota Takeda, the starting pitcher for the Hawks, pitched a complete game victory against the Swallows. Nobuhiro Matsuda, the Hawks' captain, scored the game's first run with a home run in the fourth inning. Swallows' starting pitcher Masanori Ishikawa allowed three earned runs. =Game 2= Rick van den Hurk pitched eight shutout innings against the Swallows in Game 2. The Hawks shut out the Swallows, with Hawks starting pitcher Rick van den Hurk pitching eight innings, allowing only three hits while striking out seven and issuing no walks. Closer Dennis Sarfate pitched the ninth inning for the Hawks. On offense, Lee Dae-ho and Akira Nakamura hit home runs for the Hawks. =Game 3= Tetsuto Yamada became the first player to hit three home runs in a Japan Series game. Tetsuto Yamada hit three home runs in three consecutive plate appearances during Game 3 for the Swallows, becoming the first player to hit three home runs in a Japan Series game. Shigeo Nagashima hit home runs in three consecutive plate appearances spread across two games during the 1970 Japan Series. Kazuhiro Hatakeyama also hit a home run for Yakult, while Kenji Akashi and Kenta Imamiya hit home runs for the Hawks. =Game 4= Dae-ho, who assumed the cleanup hitter role from Uchikawa, batted 3-for-4 and recorded four runs batted in during Game 4. He had an RBI single in the first inning, and hit a double that scored three runs in the third inning. Toru Hosokawa recorded an RBI double in the third inning and hit a home run in the sixth inning. Wladimir Balentien scored the Swallows' first run on a fielder's choice in the fourth inning, and the Swallows scored three more runs in the sixth inning. Though he allowed four runs in five innings and left the game with the bases loaded and no outs in the sixth inning, Tadashi Settsu was the winning pitcher. Shohei Tateyama took the loss in the game for the Swallows, as he walked too many Hawks' batters. Sarfate ended a potential ninth inning rally by Yakult to record the save. =Game 5= Lee Dae-ho, the Series MVP Dae-ho hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning for the Hawks' first runs of the game. They scored two more runs in the fourth inning and one run in the ninth inning. Meanwhile, the Hawks pitchers, led by starting pitcher Jason Standridge, who pitched six innings, recorded another shutout of the Swallows to win the series in five games. Dae-ho, who batted 8-for-16 (.500) with two home runs and eight RBIs in the five game series was named the Japan Series Most Valuable Player (MVP). He became the first Korean player to win the Japan Series MVP Award, and the first foreign player since Troy Neel in the 1996 Japan Series. Kenji Akashi, Shota Takeda, and Rick van den Hurk of the Hawks won outstanding player awards. The Fighting Spirit Award, given to the best player on the losing team of the series, went to Tetsuto Yamada of the Swallows. Masayoshi Son, the owner of the Hawks who also owns the Sprint Corporation, based in Kansas City, Missouri, joked that he would like the Hawks to play against the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball, if they won the 2015 World Series, to determine a true champion of baseball. Interestingly, the Royals did win the World Series by the same count of four games to one over the New York Mets. However, no series happened between SoftBank and the Royals.

He was Principal Flute of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under the conductor Claudio Abbado at the age of 23 and was also associated with several orchestras including the London Symphony Orchestra, London Mozart Players, London Chamber Soloists Chamber Orchestra. During the mid-1980s, Boustany presented his London debut concerts at the Wigmore Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Barbican Centre. In 1986 he stood down from all orchestral playing in order to pursue a solo and teaching career. Instruments Boustany plays on a Brannen Kingma-System Flute, a revolutionary key system that facilitates the playing of quartertones, multiphonics and allows for subtle venting/shading to improve intonation and tone quality. Boustany has recently switched to a wood headjoint made by Tobias Mahncke. Professional works Boustany has performed in the Wigmore Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room, Barbican, St John‚Äôs Smith Square, St James Piccadilly, Lincoln Center, Musikverein, Concertgebouw, Gran Teatre del Liceu, Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Beiteddine Festival, Al-Bustan Festival and others.

The title of the piece, Poison Mushroom, referred to the mushroom clouds that formed after the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I wrote a programme note for the concert which you can find at daifujikura.com Michael Oliva, Beat Furrer, Simon Holt, Boghos Gelalian, Waleed Howrani, Marcel Khalife, and Shaun Bracey.

The journalists returned to Spain on 8 May 2016, after being released by the Al-Nusra Front.  Personal  Antonio Pampliega was born in 1982. Jose Manuel L√≥pez was born in Madrid, Spain in 1971. √Ångel Sastre Canelas was born around 1981 in Don Benito, Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain. Before his disappearance, he was based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he resides. He wrote a blog called Machedtada where he discusses his views on his industry.  Career  Antonio Pampliega worked as a freelancer for the Agence France-Press among others. Pampliega has recently become a part of the \\"Infilitrados\\" program that was broadcast on Cuatro and he was an associate producer for \\"Cuerdos de Atar\\". Antonio had friends that were kidnapped before him. He did not let this deter him and he wanted to continue covering the happenings in Syria. Jose Manuel L√≥pez has been a photojournalist, primarily working in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Kosovo, and Iran for the last 11 years. He began his career at The Chronicle of Leon. He has been honored for his work over and over again. He received a gold medal in his category for his story of civil defense units of the Syrian city of Aleppo, in Paris he won the Px3 Prix of Photography Award, and just recently he received the Prix Luchetta Photography Marco Image for his photograph of Somali children playing in the ruins of Mogashishu. √Ångel Sastre Canelas is a journalist, who has worked in television, radio, and print. He regularly worked with the Spanish television network, Cuatro, radio station Onda Cero, and newspaper, La Razon. In addition, he was a contributor to Telecinco, Antena 3, and El Confidencial. From a young age, Sastre dreamed of being a journalist. For the last nine years, he has worked in the riskiest parts of the world. He was the recipient of the Larra Award in 2010. He stated, \\"The journalist's mission is to bother the power and denounce injustice, inequality, and abuse. We want to go where people do not go, because as Gervasio Sanchez said, 'wars without journalists are worse.'\\"  Disappearance  Over 90 journalists have been abducted in Syria since the beginning of the Syrian conflict with an estimated 25 journalists missing. All three men have worked in many war zones. Pampliega and Sastre also spent a month reporting in Aleppo in October 2013. At the time of their disappearance, they were freelancing in Aleppo, where they were reporting on the Syrian Civil War. They entered Syria from Turkey on 10 July 2015. They were last heard from on 12 July, and it is assumed they disappeared 13 July. The Spanish Federation of Journalists reported the group missing. Since the incident, a fourth Japanese journalist, Jumpei Yasuda, has also been kidnapped. He has been vaguely reported to also have been taken by Syrian officials.  Impact  Since the many disappearances of journalists in Syria since 2013 due to the rise of the Islamic State group, most media organizations have decided that it is safer to avoid covering the events in Syria. There is an unacceptable risk level. Since the beginning of 2015, it is rare for any non-native journalist to go into northern Syria, where al-Qaida and Isis are most prominent.  Context  In the city Aleppo, there has been severe fighting between regime and rebel forces, including ISIL. It is rumored that the journalists were captured by unknown gunmen dressed in Afghan and Pakistani style clothing whom were traveling in a minivan. There have been no reports on whether or not the kidnappers want a ransom. There has not been much information released, as Syrian officials afraid of retaliation. Reactions Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders, said, \\"We are very concerned about the fate of these three Spanish journalists, who disappeared in Aleppo, a city controlled partly by Islamic State and partly by Al-Nusra Front, another armed group. We urge the Spanish government to use all possible means to find these journalists and we appeal to all parties to the conflict to respect the work of the media and to stop taking hostages for political ends. The UN Security Council's recent Resolution 2222 pointed out that journalists covering armed conflicts are civilians, that they cannot be deliberately targeted and that they enjoy special protection.\\" Sherif Mansour, Middle East program coordinator for Committee to Protect Journalists, said, \\"The disappearance of these four journalists underscores that Syria remains an extremely risky place for the press. The media are at the mercy of all sides in the conflict, which have consistently shown not only a disregard for civilians' rights but a willingness to use journalists for their own deadly purposes.\\"  References  Category:2016 in the Syrian Civil War Category:Foreign hostages in Syria Category:Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War Category:Kidnappings of journalists Category:Spanish journalists ","title":"Disappearance of Antonio Pampliega, Jos√© Manuel L√≥pez and √Ångel Sastre"},{"id":"48319201","text":"Roosevelt \\"Rosie\\" Manning, Jr. (born May 31, 1950) is a former American football defensive tackle who played four seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Atlanta Falcons and Philadelphia Eagles.

Austin was closed in 1978 due to declining enrollment and a desire by the Augustinians to sell the school's property. Throughout its existence, Austin functioned in an unremarkable, austere, cinder block and brick building on an eleven-acre site at the corner of East Warren Avenue and Canyon Street on the far east side of Detroit, adjacent to the Grosse Pointes.

Closing  Austin Commemorative Plaque, St. Clare's Church, Grosse Pointe Park, MI =Decline of Student Pool= Detroit's loss of population accelerated after the city's 1967 race riots. This lessened the demographic pool of Catholic boys in a large segment of Austin's east-side catchment area. Excellent public high schools in the neighboring Grosse Pointe communities also siphoned away boys who would otherwise have attended Austin. =Reasons for Closure Given by Augustinians= As late as July 1977, Austin was advertising in a metropolitan-Detroit-wide newspaper for applicants for grades 9‚Äì12, touting its college prep curriculum and art and music programs, among other attractions.Advertisement for Applicants. Detroit Free Press, p. 6-B, 27 July 1977. At the start of the 1977‚Äì78 academic year, Austin had an enrollment of 427 boys and charged tuition of approximately $900 per year.Austin Prep School to Close Next Year (Enrollment and Tuition). Detroit Free Press, p. 4-A, 1 November 1977. In late October 1977, however, the faculty and students were surprised by a letter from the Midwest Province of the Augustinians, announcing that the school would be closed the following year. The letter cited declining enrollment and the availability of fewer teachers from within the Augustinian Order. Besides Austin, the Midwest Province operated four other high schools in the central part of the United States: Cascia Hall Preparatory School in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Mendel Catholic High School and St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago, Illinois, and Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox, Illinois. The Order decided that one of the four high schools needed to be closed, and chose Austin due to declining enrollment and its being located in an area that‚Äîat the time‚Äîwas served by other Catholic high schools. The letter stated that to survive Austin would need to double its enrollment in the coming years, an outcome the Order did not think realistic.Austin Prep School to Close Next Year (Details of Closing). Detroit Free Press, p. 4-A, 1 November 1977. =Efforts to Keep Austin Open= Before the end of November, a group of parents formed a committee to attempt to keep the school open. The committee met with representatives of the Augustinians, and reportedly came away with a promise that the parents could lease the school if they committed to keeping their sons enrolled. A spokesman for the parents committee said after the meeting: \\"We're all charged. We think we can do it. We think we can cut it.\\"Pupils with a Promise. Detroit Free Press, p. 3-A, 22 November 1977. In March 1978, however, the Augustinian Provincial Council in Chicago rejected the promise of a lease, instead demanding that the property be purchased at market value, estimated to be over two million dollars. Neither the parents nor the Archdiocese of Detroit were capable of making such a purchase. Speaking for the Archdiocese, John Cardinal Dearden, the archbishop of Detroit, said \\"We deeply regret the outcome of the discussions [with the Augustinian Provincial Council]. We supported the initiative taken by the group of concerned parents . . . up to this time we had been hopeful that those efforts would be successful.\\"Austin to close in June.

De La Salle and Catholic Central high schools had long-before vacated Detroit for suburban locations. Among Austin's brother-schools, only the Jesuit-operated University of Detroit High School chose to continue its educational mission within the city. =Disposition of Property= The Augustinians sold Austin's property for other uses.

He was notorious for promoting neo-Sovietism and cancellation of the state of Ukraine for the lost Soviet Union. Media supporting the Russian government declared his disappearance a murder.  Personal  Much of Dolgov's personal life is unknown. According to Amnesty International, Sergei had a wife named Olga Dolgova who expressed great concern for his safety and believed her husband at the time was being held at the military base A1978 in Zaporizhia.http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/uaa21514.pdf  Career  Sergei Dolgov was the chief editor of two Russian-language newspapers Vestnik Pryazovya (Translated: Azov Region Courier) and Khochu v SSSR (Translated: I want to go to the USSR), in Mariupol. Disappearance and death Dolgov was abducted from the Vestnik Pryazovya office on the afternoon of 18 June 2014 by six masked men in civilian dress with automatic weapons. The perpetrators took computers. They beat Dolgov and then took him away with his hands tied. Colleagues of Dolgov think his abduction was linked to his editing of Khochu v SSSR, which mainly published historical articles about the Soviet era and which was considered by some Ukrainian newspapers a \\"separatist\\" publication. His whereabouts and the identity and motive of his abductors remained unknown for five days. Konstatin Dolgov, who is also a leader of the pro-separatist People's Front of Novorossiya movement, added that his namesake had been \\"tortured\\" by kidnappers, saying \\"the enhanced interrogation ended in the death of the journalist.\\" According to employees of Vestnik Priazovya, Dolgov had been missing since mid-June when masked men armed with automatic rifles barged into their editorial offices in the eastern Ukrainian town of Mariupol and abducted Dolgov, tying up his hands with wire. Serhiy Spasitel, the head of the Mariupol regional branch of Ukraine's Security Service, said a few days later that Dolgov was alive and well, but that questions about his specific whereabouts should be addressed to Ukraine's Anti-Terror Center ‚Äî the SBU agency in charge of combating the separatist movement in the country's east. Mariupol Prosecutor Serhiy Reznitsky also denied any knowledge of the supposed abduction, saying police and prosecutors \\"do not always know what is happening [at the Anti-Terror Center]\\"  Context  According to a timeline on The Guardian, at least eleven cases of intimidation to journalists were reported that resulted in detainment, expulsion, bomb threats, injury, attack, job suspension, and murder. The various parties to the Ukrainian conflict are waging an all-out information war that has been exacerbated by the approach of the 25 May presidential election. According to Reporters Without Borders, \\"the anti-Kiev rebels in eastern Ukraine have been targeting journalists since March. Now the Ukrainian authorities are behaving with growing hostility to journalists working for Russian media\\". Three other examples of attacks and arrests happened in Mariupol in 2014. In May 2014, Graham Phillips, a British journalist who works for the Russian pro-government TV station Russia Today, was released on the evening of 21 May after being arrested the previous day by the National Guard at a border post on the outskirts of Mariupol, and being taken immediately to the headquarters of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kiev for interrogation. Phillips said he was arrested for having a bulletproof vest. Vlad Alexandrovich was kidnapped in Mariupol, where he had been working for Anna News and Southeast Front, two news agencies allied with the pro-Russian rebels. He is said to have been the author of reports about the Ukrainian army actions in Mariupol on May 9. His abductors are thought to have been Ukrainian security officials. September 9, freelance photographer Maksim Voytenko was suspected of spying. September 15, he was arrested at a Ukrainian checkpoint in Mariupol, and was released after being questioned for seven hours.  Impact  OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Dunja Mijatovic, stated that two Ukrainian journalists were abducted in the Donetsk region. An attack on the editorial office of the Pro Gorod newspaper in the city of Torez, Donetsk region, on June 26 was believed to have been related to the case. Mijatovic's statement, published by the OSCE, states that on June 28, an editor of the Druzhkovsky Rabochiy newspaper, Boris Yuzhik, was kidnapped in Donetsk just after a few days that Sergei had gone missing.  Reactions  Concerned about this situation, the Greek MEP Konstantinos Papadakis (Communist Party of Greece, or KKE) issued a statement on December 8, the request of the European Commission: his wife had complained that Dolgov was kidnapped in a \\"cleansing operation\\", held in the city of Mariupol by \\"nationalist\\" and \\"fascist\\" forces associated with the authorities in Kiev. However, the government of Ukraine refused to comment. Rumors circulated that the SBU‚Äôs head had confirmed that Dolgov was being held in Zaporishia. On March 5, after three months, European Commission representative Federica Mogherini responded: Oleksandr Kofman, a pro-Moscow activist in eastern Ukraine, praised Dolgov saying, \\"He was a principled journalist who upheld a position that contradicted the view of the new Kiev government. Dolgov's murder is another crime for which the representatives of the Kiev administration will receive their due punishment sooner or later.\\" Russian journalists who intervened in political issues had always been resolved by way of negotiation, confinement, or deportation but Sergei Dolgov was killed.

The site in 2013 had over $100 million in art for sale on its marketplace and had received investment from Accelerator Ventures and Metamorphic Ventures. The company was founded in 2010 by Christopher E. Vroom and Catherine Levene. Levene was named as one of the top 10 female CEOs to watch in 2011 by the Huffington Post. History Christopher E. Vroom and Catherine Levene co-founded Artspace in late 2010. Vroom, an avid art collector and well known patron of the arts, is credited as the strategic vision behind the business, who recognized the potential to create a platform offering quality fine art to a broad audience. Levene stated in a 2011 interview that she felt e-commerce art marketplaces could become the norm for people interested in buying art. She also stated that it could result in a similar market shift for buying art, as that which took place with clothing in the late 1990s. At the time of Artspace's launch, it was stated that the company was one of the first major efforts to commercialize the art marketplace, making art accessible to everyone. Before the launch of Artspace, most art sales were made in person, often in galleries, and transactions were rarely completed online. Another obstacle Artspace had to overcome was that viewing art before purchasing it was a must at the time. Artspace challenged both of these common viewpoints in the art industry. In an interview with Business Insider, Levene said that she felt large auction houses such as Sotheby's had missed an opportunity to open online marketplaces for art. Shortly after the interview in 2011, Levene was named by the Huffington Post as one of the top 10 female CEOs to watch. Vroom was responsible for attracting top-level galleries, museums, cultural institutions and major artists to sell in an online context for the first time. Within the first year of Artspace's existence, it received $1.2 million in investment as an early stage startup. Artspace's products were included in the revolutionary idea STORY, which was developed by Rachel Shechtman later that year. The STORY store in New York City contained art from Artspace, along with products from other startups. The company received two rounds of capital investments, beginning in 2012. A Series A funding round in early 2012 secured $2.5 million for the company, with investors including Accelerator Ventures and Metamorphic Ventures. In early 2013, the company secured a venture capital investment of $8.5 million from Canaan Partners. Mechanics Artspace is an e-commerce platform which performs like an online marketplace. The online service began in 2011 with an inventory of art with a total estimated value of $7‚Äì8 million. By 2013, this had increased to more than $100 million in estimated value. The firm is based in New York City and at the time of launch provided contemporary pieces for $200 to $10,000. This value has since changed to include more valuable pieces. Artspace is quoted to have over 2,000 active artists from 400 galleries publishing works through its marketplace. The galleries and cultural institutions cover 30 countries and include The Guggenheim, The Whitney Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and the Serpentine Galleries. Work on the website has come from artists such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Yayoi Kusama. The website and marketplace are aimed at making art more accessible to those who know little about art, or live far away from galleries. In 2013 during an interview, it was stated that the website didn't use any form of advanced imagery to display art, instead using jpeg images. Levene stated, \\"Paying that huge sum without seeing the art can be scary for some people, but we‚Äôve seen in the last ten years that there is an explosion of sales being made by simply sending jpegs.\\" A 2014 report by Hiscox stated that the online art market was valued at around $1 billion.

During airport construction in 2015‚Äì2016, it was moved to Lane Community College. The airport renovations were completed by early January 2017, and all but about 30 of the original Flight Patterns images were reinstalled at the airport in early December 2017. Description Flight Patterns consists of approximately 176 black and white photographic cutouts of people, whimsically posed as if they were flying, on seven mural panels originally installed on the walls of Concourse A at Eugene Airport. Popular Photography described the subjects as \\"People with extended arms, carrying such items as briefcases, blueprints, teddy bears, or a tray of wine and pastry. People wearing business clothes or jogging outfits or nothing at all (discreetly covered by a fluffy cloud)‚Ä¶.people expressing the exhilaration of flying.\\" Artist David Joyce explained, \\"I thought, 'Wow, what if you could just hold out your arms and fly yourself? Superman! Mighty Mouse!'\\" The resulting photographic sculpture has been described as \\"one of the most beloved art installations in Lane County\\". Among the people was writer and performer Garrison Keillor, who was in Eugene for a show when the work was being created; his image was the only one of a non-local person used. Other notable people in the work include cartoonist Jan Eliot.  History  David Joyce received a US$15,000 commission in 1988 for an installation of his artwork as part of the remodeling of the airport. He posed his volunteer subjects in flying position on a padded mat, and photographed them with a 35 mm camera while he was standing on a ladder. He then used mural paper to create prints that were approximately two-thirds life-size. In 2011 the 22-year-old installation was dismounted, refurbished and replaced following a repair to a leak in the airport's wall. The cost of refabrication was supported by 1% for Art funds and an auction of some of the original figures. Flight Patterns was again removed during the airport's planned expansion in 2015‚Äì2016, and was temporarily displayed at the David Joyce Gallery, Building 19 on the campus of Lane Community College. The airport, in consultation with Joyce's widow Kacey Joyce, considered whether to permanently remove the artwork and display it instead at the college. Upon learning that it might not be re-installed at the Eugene Airport, Eugene's then-Mayor Kitty Piercy said that the \\"flying people\\" are \\"iconic and part of our art history\\". In early January 2017, the airport's passenger terminal renovations were completed, and airport management decided \\"to take a comprehensive look and see where public art can be placed\\". The airport had paid Lane Community College US$5000 to install the art in the David Joyce Gallery on campus, but the gallery could not display all the images at once. Lane President Mary Spilde said, \\"We've loved having it, but now that the renovation is complete we will work with the airport on returning it.\\" In December 2017, airport workers reinstalled many of the 176 original cutouts in the baggage claim area, leaving out approximately 30 of the images due to lack of space. One of the images the airport decided not to install was that of Garrison Keillor, following his firing by Minnesota Public Radio. According to The Register-Guard, \\"Mayor Lucy Vinis left open the possibility of the city reinstalling the Keillor photo in the future at the city-owned airport.\\" According to public art consultant Greta Latchford, \\"The 'flying people' remind us all that despite the latest developments in aviation technology, it's our human connection that matters most (at the airport).\\"  References  External links * Working City ‚Äì Flight Patterns Category:1980s murals Category:1989 establishments in Oregon Category:1989 works Category:1989 in art Category:1989 sculptures Category:Black-and-white photographs Category:Eugene, Oregon Category:Murals in Oregon Category:Sculptures in Oregon Category:Culture of Eugene, Oregon Category:1980s photographs ","title":"Flight Patterns"},{"id":"48319727","text":"Institutions are social constructs, both cultural and organizational.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1785 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 100 people.

According to some sources, an Irish hermit settled on the island in the middle ages and he is the one who built the first chapel on the island. In 1704 a major repair work took place, and from the description it appears that the church was then a small log building. In 1785, the old church was torn down and replaced by a new church, which mainly still stands. In 1954, the tower and sacristy were added to the building.

Life Frank West Rich was born in Darfield, South Yorkshire in 1840 and was educated at Whitwell, Derbyshire. It appears from the 1861 Census that he trained as a joiner and was 23 before he was articled to William Parnell,http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=203599 an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. He worked with Parnell until 1872 during which time the firm built the Tyne Theatre and Opera House in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1867. Rich set up his own practice at 1 Moseley Street in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1872. He married Mary Elliott in 1868 and had three sons and a daughter. Two of his sons, Edmund and Roland, also became architects. From 1881 the family home was in Jesmond Gardens. In 1903 Rich purchased Dues Hill Grange and 3000 acres of land in Holystone, Northumberland, which he subsequently renovated. Rich designed many buildings in the Newcastle upon Tyne area, including the Watch Club House in Cullercoats (1877‚Äì79), Ouseburn School (1893) and St Gabriel‚Äôs Church in Heaton (1905). In the 1880s he had the role of architectural consultant to Sir William Armstrong and designed workshops and offices at his Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. He designed the north block of what was later known as the EF Turnbull warehouse for Robinson & Co in 1888 in Newcastle upon Tyne. Additions were made to the south in 1897 and a tower constructed in 1898. Rich also designed for Sir Andrew Noble, building extensions to Jesmond Dene House (1896‚Äì97), which had been originally designed by RN Shaw. He also added a stable block to Otterburn Tower for Howard Pease in 1904. Rich also made additions to Chesters (Humshaugh) in Northumberland (1895), another building on which RN Shaw had worked. He was a member of the Northern Architects Association serving as its President, Vice President and Hon Secretary in the 1880s and 1890s. He was elected a FRIBA in 1898. He died in 1929.

DiMattina is stylistically versatile, composing and performing in a range of genres encompassing jazz roots, country, blues, classical and other contemporary styles. DiMattina's recorded oeuvre reflects these diverse interests and she cites cited J. S. Bach, Nina Simone, Sidney Bechet, √âdith Piaf, Bob Dylan, Astor Piazzolla, Toots Thielemans, Rickie Lee Jones, Lili Boulanger, Donny Hathaway and Allen Toussaint as influences on her music. As a songwriter diMattina is known for pithy turns of phrase. Life and career DiMattina grew up in Melbourne, Australia. Her paternal grandparents immigrated to Australia from the volcanic island of Stromboli off the coast of Sicily, while she has English (convict) heritage on her mother's side. Both parents and all five siblings played music to some degree. When diMattina's maternal grandmother gifted the household with a piano young Monique became hooked. Through her high school years she focussed on classical piano repertoire, also playing clarinet, alto saxophone, celtic harp, electric bass, guitar and orchestral percussion. DiMattina studied law at the University of Melbourne after leaving high school, but left the course to take up jazz piano studies at the Victorian College of the Arts. She completed Master of Music and Bachelor of Letters degrees at the University of Melbourne, focussing her masters thesis on Miles Davis pianist Wynton Kelly. In 2000 after receiving several prizes and awards including a Queens Trust award and Fulbright Postgraduate Scholarship, diMattina moved to New York City where she lived on and off until 2009. There she waited tables at the Village Vanguard Jazz Club while studying with Sophia Rosoff, a founder of the Abby Whiteside Foundation, Fred Hersch, Sam Yahel and Barry Harris. She played regularly at the 55 Bar, the Living Room, Rockwood Music Hall and Joe's Pub, performed recitals for dignitaries including Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton and Vaclav Havel. She also worked on the Bjork Dancer in the Dark web orchestrations, opened for Lou Reed, ran the New York City marathon and taught at the Henry Street Music School. In 2002, diMattina released Live at the 55, an instrumental collection of covers and originals in a blues and roots vain, with Adam Armstrong on bass, Kim Thompson on drums, diMattina on wurlitzer piano and K. T Tolhurst on pedal steel. In between periods in New York City, diMattina travelled extensively, spending time in Europe, Japan, China and one year in Sydney as principal pianist in Disney's The Lion King orchestra. DiMattina's first child was born in Harlem in 2008. She returned to live in Melbourne in 2009. In 2009 diMattina released her first solo piano album, Senses, on the Move label. In 2010 she released Welcome Stranger on Head Records, the first album in which she sings in addition to playing piano. The album mostly contains original songs, with a cover of Paul Kelly's song \\"Dumb Things\\" in a New Orleans style. She has said that the album title refers to a famously large gold nugget unearthed near Ballarat during the Victorian gold rush as well as the experience of returning as a stranger to one's hometown after years away. The album was written of as being quintessentially Melbournesque‚Äî\\"about us and the place we live\\" by The Age columnist and music writer Chris Johnson. The song \\"Livingest Place\\" was dubbed the \\"nicest slyest Melbourne vs Sydney song ever\\" by Doug Spenser on ABC Radio National. In 2011 diMattina followed with a second solo piano album, Sun Signs, designed around the 12 signs of the zodiac. During this period she performed a regular segment called \\"Shaken Not Rehearsed\\" on radio station 3RRR 102.7 FM as a guest on Tim Thorpe's Vital Bits program and later on ABC 774 with Lindy Burns when she would play bespoke songs on air, written according to listener requests within the hour. DiMattina also performed in the Clare Bowditch musical theatre piece Eva based on the life of jazz singer Eva Cassidy and opened for Chris Botti on his Australian tour. In 2012 diMattina recorded her fifth album, Nola's Ark, at Piety Studios in New Orleans with producer Mark Bingham (John Scofield, Cassandra Wilson) and musicians from the bands of Harry Connick Jr and Dr John including Leroy Jones on trumpet , Matt Perrine on bass and June Yamagishi on guitar. Many of the eight original songs on the album originated in the \\"Shaken Not Rehearsed\\" segment. Nola's Ark was released on Head Records in May 2013. In October 2015 diMattina released Everybody Loves Somebody, her sixth album on the Head Records label. Of this album Martin Jones of Rhythms magazine wrote thsat \\"Monique diMattina has reached that hallowed ground where influences and inspirations coalesce to produce a unique voice. On this new album, jazz sensibilities and classic songwriting skills blend to produce something reminiscent of the jazzier shadows of Rickie Lee Jones or Joni Mitchell. That is to say, some of the approaches, and aesthetics draw from jazz, but first and foremost it's about the singer and her songs.\\"Rhythms, January/February 2016. In 2016 diMattina was musical director of Tapestry: The Music of Carol King starring Vika Bull and Debra Byrne. From 2017 to the present, diMattina has toured extensively with Australian singer-songwriter Rebecca Barnard in their jointly penned shows The Dao of Dylan and Honky Tonk Women. She has also performed regularly with the Happy House jazz band (Paul Williamson, Fem Belling, Michael Jordan and James Clark), Alma Zygier and Harry James Angus. DiMattina lives in Melbourne with her two daughters and teaches at the Victorian College of the Arts (Melbourne Conservatorium of Music) and at the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music at Monash University.

This typically involves an attorney filing a written legal motion for consideration by a judge. Parliamentary use In a parliamentary context, as used in a legislative body, a motion to vacate is made by a member of the body to propose that the presiding officer (or 'chair') step down. That is commonly referred to as a \\"motion to vacate the chair\\". =In the U.S. House of Representatives= The use of a motion to vacate the chair has been very rare in the United States House of Representatives, where under House rules it was considered a privileged motion, meaning any Member can offer such a motion at any time and is subject to an immediate vote.

Lindor was a prominent voice in politics, speaking mostly on behalf of the Democratic interests of the Haitian people. His brutal murder was blamed on threats from leftist politicians who supported President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.  Personal  Lindor was born in Petit-Go√¢ve on 4 November 1970. Lindor had a younger brother, Mor√©no, and younger sisters, Nene, Dedel, Liline and Marie Michele. He attended √âcole Nationale des Palmes for his primary education and went on to Lycee Faustin Soulouque for his secondary education, which are both in Petit-Go√¢ve. He went on to study journalism and law in the Facult√© de Droit et des Sciences Economiques at the √âcole de Droit des Gona√Øves, where he earned his law degree.  Career  Lindor began his career as a journalist as a member of the Haitian Press Agency, and then spent four years as a correspondent for at Radio Signal FM. Lindor later helped organize the Association des Journalistes de Petit Goave, where he served as Adjunct General Secretary, and worked as the news editor for the private station Radio Echo 2000 from 1995 until 2001. During this time he also worked as a customs agent and taught. At Radio Echo 2000, he hosted a political show called \\"Dialogue,\\" on which he interviewed political figures, including Aristide supporters. On 28 November 2001, he conducted an interview with members of the 15-party opposition coalition Convergence D√©mocratique (English: Democratic Convergence). Because of his open opposition to the Fanmi Lavalas political party, the Mayor had given him the nickname \\"Iron Pants.\\" This nickname also earned Lindor countless death threats from local authorities and radical supporters of President Aristide. In addition to being a news editor, Lindor also worked as an inspector at the local customs office, and also taught social science classes at the Caribbean Secondary Centre school in Petit- Go√¢ve.  Death  On the morning of 3 December 2001, Lindor and Emmanuel Espoir Cl√©danor, a former journalist for Radio Plus, were en route to the village of Mirago√¢ne. When they reached L'Acul, approximately 5 km outside of Petit-Go√¢ve, their vehicle was attacked by members of ‚ÄúD√≥mi Nan Bwa\\", who are supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party. Cl√©danor managed to escape unharmed. Lindor attempted to hide in the nearby home of Mr. Z√©phir P√©tuel, President of the Assembly of the Communal Section (ASEC) of the First Plain and member of Popular Organization \\"D√≤mi nan Bwa.\\" As Lindor was chased by his attackers, he was forced to surrender and then hacked to death with machetes. Just three days prior to Lindor's murder, Dumay Bony, the deputy mayor of Petit-Go√¢ve, referred to Lindor as a terrorist, and encouraged others to apply the policy of \\"zero tolerance\\", which was a euphemism for lynching, to Lindor and a list of others considered to be affiliated with the opposition. Lindor became a specific target of this policy, because of his recent invitation to members of the Convergence D√©mocratique to appear on his radio show \\"Dialogue\\". The group openly criticized the governance of President Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas Party. Lindor's murder is presumed to be linked to an attack by members of the Convergence D√©mocratique on Joseph C√©us Duverger, a chief of Domi nan Bwa, earlier that same morning. This is supported by the fact that Love Augustin, another member of the Convergence D√©mocratique, was about to be executed in his home by a group of Domi nan Bwa members, until they spotted Lindor's car pull up across the street, and immediately left Augustin to go attack Lindor. Ten Domi nan Bwa members have been indicted for Lindor's murder, including Raymond D√©sulm√©, Sissi Dio, D'or Monal, Jo√´l Jolifils, Saint-Juste Joubert, Bob Toussaint, Fritznel Doudoute (aka Lionel Doudoute), Ti Florian, Jean-Raymond Flory and Sedner Sainvilus (known as Ti Lapli), but only four have been arrested. Two of the charged, Joubert Saint-Juste and Jean-Remy Demosthene, were convicted and sentenced to life, seven more were convicted in absentia, and of those none have been arrested or brought into custody. One of the defendants was acquitted because he was arrested by a mistake in identity having shared the same name as one of the alleged killers. Following his murder, Lindor's family still received many threats, and was ultimately forced to flee the country and seek asylum in Paris, France.  Context  Petit-Go√¢ve from around 1981.Haiti has experienced several long periods of political tension, one of which can be traced back to the decision by a group of small political organizations to boycott the presidential elections of 2000. This boycott was their way of protesting the parliamentary elections earlier that year, which they claimed had fraudulently awarded 15 of the 19 Senate seats and eighty percent of seats in the House of Assembly to Jean Bertrand Aristide's newly formed Fanmi Lavalas party. This group of political organizations later joined together to form an alliance known as the Convergence D√©mocratique, also referred to as the \\"opposition,\\" which sought to undermine the authority of President Aristide. Directly related to this political tension, the beginning of 2001 marked an enormous decline in press freedom in Haiti, with close to 40 journalists having faced violent threats or attacks in that year alone. The majority of these threats and attacks were initiated by either police or supporters of President Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas Party, therefore greatly reducing the likelihood of any government intervention on behalf of the victims of this violence. That situation was a direct result of President Aristide's instatement of a \\"zero tolerance\\" campaign against crime in June of that year. Through this campaign, police officers were allowed and even encouraged to punish criminals on the spot, without a trial, if they are caught red-handed. Members of the press/media in Haiti were often characterized by President Aristide as members of the opposition, but such allegations served as a way of justifying the violence that was being committed against them, regardless of whether or not the allegations were in fact true. Lindor has not been the only journalist to be killed in Haiti, as in 2000 Jean L√©opold Dominique of Radio Haiti-Inter and G√©rard Denoze of Radio Plus met the same fate.  Impact  Lindor proved to be a prominent and influential voice for democracy in Haiti, specifically in his small town of Petit-Go√¢ve. He did not associate himself with any one political group, but instead used his position at Radio Echo 2000 to give all groups the chance to share their views and opinions. The nature of Lindor's murder was especially gruesome, and acted as a new kind of warning for all members of the media that are considered to be aligned with the opposition. A dozen other journalists were so afraid that they would meet the same fate as Lindor that they fled the country soon after his murder. Lindor was not the only Haitian journalist to be killed by supporters of Aristide, but his murder led to a particular increase in outrage toward Aristide's administration, causing the people of Petit-Go√¢ve, followed by both national and international communities, to organize protests and even riots that demanded justice for Lindor. He is one example across the region of journalists who have been threatened by politicians and killed as a result.  Reactions  UNESCO Director-General Ko√Øchiro Matsuura condemned the murder, saying, \\"The murder of Brignol Lindor, in horrific circumstances, will cause indignation among all who believe in the democratic future of Haiti and all those who struggle for freedom of expression. I request the highest authorities of the country to make all resources available to investigators so that this heinous crime will not go unpunished. A society that endeavors to heal the wounds of the past and build a democratic future needs all forums of expression and dialogue.\\" Nearly a full year after Lindor was murdered, more than 8,000 protesters walked through the streets of Petit-Go√¢ve, Haiti, on 18 November 2002, and chanted \\"Down with Aristide!\\" and \\"Justice for Brignol!\\" according to a report by Radio Vision 2000 On the first anniversary of his murder, his brother Moreno issued a call for justice through Reporters Without Borders, saying, \\"I was at home the day I heard he had been chopped to death. I feared it was the end for my family. I was wrong. But we were threatened and had to flee the country. A year later, the killers can still count on the inertia of the authorities. The hardest thing is the injustice of it, that nobody has been punished. My brother was killed because he allowed everyone to speak on the radio. Haitians must be given their say and Brignol must be given justice.\\" See also * Media of Haiti  References  Category:2001 deaths Category:Assassinated Haitian journalists Category:Deaths by stabbing in Haiti Category:Haitian journalists Category:Journalists killed by a mob Category:People from Ouest (department) Category:Radio reporters and correspondents Category:1970 births Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Brignol Lindor"},{"id":"48320213","text":"Robert Hugh Steele (born August 2, 1956) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings.

He was born in 1741 (or 1742) at Torpenhow, England. At age 14 he moved to Whitehaven to take up an apprenticeship as a carpenter for a shipbuilder.Daniel Brocklebank - accessed 21 October 2015. In 1770, Brocklebank established a shipyard at Sheepscutt (Sheepscot), which is near Portland, Maine. National Museums Liverpool - Maritime Archives & Library Information Sheet #18: Thomas & John Brocklebank - accessed 21 October 2015. He brought with him his wife Anne, to whom he had been married only one year, and their baby daughter Sarah. At Sheepscot he built five ships, one per year. When the American Revolution commenced, he took his family and his newest vessel, Castor, launched in early 1775 and not yet fully fitted out, and sailed home to Britain. Castor and other vessels in a choppy sea; Thomas Luny, 1802, National Maritime Museum In 1779 he received a letter of marque and became a privateer, using Castor, reportedly a brig of 220 tons (bm), that he armed with 20 guns.The Compass (1960; Vol.304), p.67. When Castor was lost near Jamaica in 1781, he had the firm of Spedding & Co. build a second Castor. This was probably the Castor launched in 1782 that traded as far as Bengal and served until 1808, though Brocklebank apparently sold her in 1791 or 1792. Spedding & Co. also built the ship Precedent and the brig Cyrus for Brocklebank. In addition, Brocklebank purchased several ships from Stockdale & Co. Brocklebank was able to restart his shipbuilding firm in 1785 (or 1788). Here he built some 25 (or 27) vessels. By 1795 he had built up a fleet of eleven vessels of a total burthen of 1,750 tons (bm). Brocklebank died in 1801. His two sons then took over the firm, which they renamed Thomas and John Brocklebank; later it became Thos. and Jno. Brocklebank.

A balbal or ancient human statue was chosen as the ceremonial foundation site (Shav) of the city when it settled in 1778 at its current location. Presently, modern stone turtle sits atop the spot of the ancient balbal near S√ºkhbaatar Square in the city center. Prehistory Human habitation at the site of Ulaanbaatar dates from the Lower Paleolithic. Alexey Okladnikov's archeological work in 1949 and 1960 revealed many Paleolithic sites on Mt. Bogd Khan Uul, Buyant-Ukhaa and Mt. Songinokhairkhan. In 1962 various Paleolithic tools were discovered at Mt. Songinokhairkhan as well as Buyant-Ukhaa (23 stone tools) that scholars date from 300,000 years ago to 40,000-12,000 years ago. Okladnikov also revealed an Upper Paleolithic (40,000-12,000 years ago) site on the south-east base of the Zaisan Hill on the northern edge of Mt. Bogd Khan Uul. Byambyn Rinchen mentions it as an inspiration for his prehistoric novel Zaan Zaluudai. The lower strata of this bistratified settlement located at the present-day Zaisan Memorial revealed tools and materials fashioned according to the Levallois technique. These Upper Paleolithic people hunted mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, the bones of which are found abundantly around Ulaanbaatar. Red ochre rock paintings from the Bronze Age (1st millennium BCE) are to be found at Ikh Tenger Gorge on the north side of Mt. Bogd Khan Uul facing the city. The paintings show human figures, horses, eagles and abstract designs like horizontal lines and large squares with over a hundred dots within them. The same style of painting from the same era is found very close to the east of the city at Gachuurt, as well as in Khovsgol Aimag and southern Siberia, indicating a common South Siberian nomadic pastoral culture. Mt. Bogd Khan Uul was probably an important religious cult location for these people. Bronze Age square slab tombs are found at the Shajin Khurakh and Tur Khurakh gorges of Mount Bogd Khan Uul facing the city. To the north of Ulaanbaatar there are the vast Noin-Ula Xiongnu (Hunnu) royal tombs which are over 2,000 years old. A Xiongnu tomb has been found in Chingeltei district. The Xiongnu tombs of Belkh Gorge near Dambadarjaalin monastery are under city protection. The Xiongnu tombs of Mount Songinokhairkhan however are under national protection. Wooden cups, plates, ceramic vessels and a 12 branch deer horn were found in the \\"Xiongnu Queen Tomb\\" (Hunnu Khatni Bulsh) at the Baruun Boginiin Am gorge of Mount Bogd Khan Uul. Six tombs around this tomb show signs of ancient looting. The Wuhuan carried out large scale looting of Xiongnu tombs in 87-74 BC. Located on the banks of the sacred Tuul River (\\"Khatun Tuul\\" or Queen Tuul in legend), the area of Ulaanbaatar was well within the sphere of nomadic empires such as the Xiongnu (Hunnu) (209BC-93AD), Xianbei (Sumbe) (93AD-4th century), Rouran (Nirun) (402-555), G√∂kt√ºrk (555-745), Uighur (745-840), Khitan (907-1125) and Mongol Empire (1206‚Äì1368). At Nalaikh District there is the important Stele of Tonyukuk (c. 722 AD) with an Old Turkic inscription in the Orkhon alphabet. Mongol Empire Wang Khan Toghrul (1130-1203) of the Keraites, a Nestorian Christian monarch who was identified as the legendary Prester John by Marco Polo, is said to have had his palace here (the Black Forest of the Tuul River) and forbade hunting in the holy mountain Bogd Uul. The ruins of his palace (15x27 metres with a gate facing south) was found in Songinokhairkhan District in 1949 and excavated by D. Navaan in 2006. This brick palace influenced by Chinese architecture, later also called the Third Palace of Genghis Khan or Yesui Khatun's palace, is where Genghis Khan stayed with Yesui Khatun before attacking the Tangut in 1226. A drainage channel carried roof water out through the east and west gates of the complex. In 2003 Japanese and Koreans made special programs about this palace where many important events of Genghis Khan's life took place. Genghis Khan's father Yesukhei became blood brothers with Toghrul here and later Genghis Khan himself became son of Toghrul at this place. The Secret History of the Mongols mentions this area in many places, for example in Paragraphs 115 and 264: In 1984 a rich 13th century tomb of a 50- to 60-year-old, tall warrior with an ornate golden belt was excavated at Dadart Uul of Mt. Songinokhairkhan. He was buried with a sheep scapula, a dagger with iron blade and wooden handle, a bark quiver with three iron arrows inside, two light curved stirrups (13th century type) and remains of a cast iron tripod cauldron. His highly ornate belt composed of 39 parts with a scarab at his right hip has led to speculations this is the tomb of Jamukha. A simple 13th century rock painting of a Mongolian woman with distinct Mongolian headdress can be seen on the north side of Mt Bogd Khan Uul. Abtai Sain Khan is said to have worshipped the mountain in the 16th century as well. The French missionary Gerbillon camped at the site of Ulaanbaatar on August 5, 1698 and continued north the next day along the Selbe River valley (present-day Sukhbaatar District). He says in his Journal: 18th century The Manchu envoy Tuli≈°en wrote an account of his travels through this region in 1712, describing how his party rested and fished ten to twenty salmon and pike in the river \\"Tu-la\\" while one Ko-tcha- eur-too killed a deer with a gun in the \\"Han-shan\\" (i.e., Khan Uul). He also describes the \\"rich and luxuriant\\" nature around the \\"Sung-kee-na\\" mountains (i.e., Mount Songino Khairkhan).Staunton, Sir George Thomas Narrative of the Chinese embassy to the Tourgouth Tartars 1821, London, p. 30 Before Khalkha Mongolian nobles went and pledged allegiance to the Manchu emperor at Dolon Nor (formerly Kublai Khan's summer capital Xanadu) in 1691, the area of present-day Ulaanbaatar was under the control of Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj the brother of Zanabazar. In 1691 Chakhundorj's eldest son Galdandorj was given the title Jun Wang at Dolon Nor and given the area of present-day Ulaanbaatar. From that time onwards it became a clearly demarcated hereditary princedom called the Darkhan Chin Wangiin Khoshuu (Banner of the Darkhan Chin Wang). The Banner was centered on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and its boundaries are described in historical records of the period. Galdandorj (1691-1692) was the first Darkhan Chin Wang. His successors are: his eldest son Dondovdorj (1692-1743), Rinchendorj (1743-1755), Khajivdorj (1757-1759), Gejeedorj (1759-1771), Tsevdendorj (1771-1774), Sundevdorj (1774-1798), Nyambuudorj (1799-1832) all the way till Darkhan Chin Wang Puntsagtseren (1914-1921). Starting from 1728 till 1921 the 21 banners of Tusheet Khan Aimag held the \\"Khan Uuliin Chuulgan\\" (Assembly of Khan Uul) every three years at the north side of Mount Bogd Khan Uul, the site of Ulaanbaatar. The Assembly discussed a wide range of issues including finances, military census, livestock tax and legal issues. There were 26 Presidents of the Khan Uul Assembly starting from Tusheet Khan Vanjildorj (1728-1732) till Puntsagtseren (1914-1921). There were also a total 30 Deputy Presidents or Speakers. The 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was born at Mount Songinokhairkhan in present-day Ulaanbaatar in 1724 as the son of Darkhan Chin Wang Dondovdorj and Tsagaan Dari Bayart. Dondovdorj carried the titles Jun Wang, Darkhan Chin Wang, Khoshoi Chin Wang and Efu and also sat on the Tusheet Khan throne for two years (1700-1702). He played a part in bringing Urga inside his banner territory. From 1733 to 1743 he was both the Said (Minister-governor) of Urga and the President of the Khan Uul Assembly. One of his wives was Amarlingui Hichiyengui the 6th daughter of the Kangxi Emperor whom he received in marriage in 1697. Her tomb the Gunj Temple (1740) is partially intact in the forests north-east of Ulaanbaatar. Dondovdorj, an accomplished poet, composed the song \\"Tumen Ekh\\" praising a race horse. In 1696 Zanabazar and the Khalkha Mongolian nobles returned from Dolon Nor and camped at the north side of Mount Bogd Khan Uul. The gorge where khans and princes camped was called Tur Khurakhyn Am (State Gathering Gorge) while the one where monks and abbots camped was named Shajin Khurakhyn Am (Religion Gathering Gorge). Nobles and lamas continued to meet at this place for the next 330 years. Nukhtiin Am, on the south of Ulaanbaatar, was where Zanabazar (1635-1723) consecrated and meditated under a tree called Janchivsembe, the shadow of which was used to choose the location of Gandan Monastery in 1838.

Remaining buildings of the Dari Ekh Temple (1778) in the old Maimaicheng district. Founded in 1639 as a yurt monastery, Ulaanbaatar, then √ñrg√∂√∂ (palace-yurt), was first located at Lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur (75 km directly east of the imperial capital Karakorum) in what is now Burd sum, √ñv√∂rkhangai, around south-west from the present site of Ulaanbaatar, and was intended by the Mongol nobles to be the seat of the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Zanabazar, son of Tusheet Khan Gombodorj (1597-1655). Gombodorj was the grandson of Abtai Sain Khan (1554-1588) the grandson of Gersenz Jalair Huangtaizi (1513-1549) the youngest son of Dayan Khan (1464-1517/1543?) the 29th Great Khan and descendant of Kublai Khan (1215-1294). Zanabazar (1635-1723), known as a child prodigy able to recite the Jambaltsanjod (praise of Manjusri) at age three, was enstated in Urga in 1639. His Urga (palatial residence) was known as the Shira Busiin Ord (Yellow Screen Palace). There he was proclaimer \\"teacher of multitudes\\", ordained by high lama Wensa Brulgu Luvsandanzanjamts and received the name Luvsandambiijaltsan (Blo-bzang-bstan- pa'i-rgyal-mtshan). In 1651 Zanabazar returned to Mongolia from Tibet and founded seven aimags (monastic departments) in Urga. They were the Department of the Treasury, Department of Administration, Department of Meals, Department of the Honored Doctor, Department of Amdo, Department of Orlog and the Department of Khuukhen Noyon. In his old age he established four more monastic departments in Urga. As a mobile monastery-town, it was often moved to various places along the Selenge, Orkhon and Tuul rivers, as supply and other needs would demand. During the Dzungar wars of the late 17th century, it was even moved to Inner Mongolia.This Shireet tsagaan nuur is located in √ñv√∂rkhangai's B√ºrd sum. P. Enkhbat, O. P√ºrev, –£–ª–∞–∞–Ω–±–∞–∞—Ç–∞—Ä, Ulaanbaatar 2001, p. 9f As the city grew, it moved less and less. The movements of the city can be detailed as following: Shireet Tsagaan Nuur (1639), Khoshoo Tsaidam (1640), Khentii Mountains (1654), Ogoomor (1688), Inner Mongolia (1690), Tsetserlegiin Erdene Tolgoi (1700), Daagandel (1719), Usan Seer (1720), Ikh Tamir (1722), Jargalant (1723), Eeven Gol (1724), Khujirtbulan (1729), Burgaltai (1730), Sognogor (1732), Terelj (1733), Uliastai River (1734), Khui Mandal (1736), Khuntsal (1740), Udleg (1742), Ogoomor (1743), Selbe (1747), Uliastai River (1756), Selbe (1762), Khui Mandal (1772), Selbe (1778). In 1778, the city moved from Khui Mandal and settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers and beneath Bogd Khan Uul, back then also on the caravan route from Beijing to Kyakhta.Kohn, Michael Lonely Planet Mongolia 4th edition, 2005 , p. 52 One of the earliest Western mentions of Urga is the account of the Scottish traveller John Bell in 1721: Another early mention is in the Journal of Swedish explorer Lorenz Lange in 1722: By the time of Zanabazar's death in 1723 Urga had already become the preeminent monastery in Mongolia in terms of religious authority. A council of seven of the highest ranking lamas (Khamba Nomon Khan, Ded Khamba and five Tsorj) made most of the religious decisions in the city. It had also become the commercial center of Outer Mongolia. From 1733 till 1778 Urga basically moved around in the vicinity of its present location. In 1754 the Erdene Shanzodba Yam (Administration of Ecclesiastical Estate) of Urga was given full authority to supervise the administrative affairs of the shabinar (lay subjects of the Bogd). It also functioned and would continue to function as the chief judicial court of the city. Sunduvdorj was the Erdene Shanzodba at this time. In 1758 the Qianlong Emperor appointed the Khalkha Vice General Sanzaidorj as the first Mongol amban of Urga with full authority to \\"oversee the Khuree and administer well all the Khutugtu's shabinar\\".Zsuzsa Majer, Krisztina Teleki, Monasteries and Temples of Bogdiin Khuree, Ikh Khuree or Urga, the Old Capital City of Mongolia in the First Part of the Twentieth Century , 2006, Ulaanbaatar, p. 25 In 1761 a second amban was appointed for the same purpose, a Manchu one. In 1786 a decree was issued in Peking which gave right to the Urga ambans to make final decisions concerning the administrative affairs of Tusheet Khan and Setsen Khan territories. With this, Urga became the highest civil authority in the country. Based on Urga's Mongol governor Sanzaidorj's petition the Qianlong Emperor officially recognized an annual ceremony on Mt. Bogd Khan Uul in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations. The city was the seat not only of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtus, but also of two Qing ambans, and a Chinese trade town grew \\"four trees\\" or east of the city center at the confluence of the Uliastai and Tuul rivers. This trade district was kept at a distance in order not to block the way of pilgrims or defile the holy city (as demanded by the 4th Bogd Jebtsundamba). It had agricultural fields and artificial lakes. The Chinese had large, beautifully decorated shops selling different articles. A pair of highly ornate 11 metre tall inscribed columns (1783) standing in front of the surviving Dari Ekh Temple (1778) in the former Maimaicheng district is now under national protection. The large store Nomtiin Puus (Shop of the Pious Merchant) and ruins of another old Chinese shop are still visible. There were 14 temples in Maimaicheng: 8 Chinese and 6 Mongolian, including the Kunz Bogdiin Sum (Confucius Temple), Odon Sum (Astrological Temple), Tsagaan Malgaitiin Sum (White Hat Mosque of Chinese Muslims), Dari Ehiin Sum (Guanyin Temple), Geser Sum (Guandi Temple), Erleg Khaani Sum (Temple of the Lord of Death), Erliiziin Sum (Temple of the Mixed- Ethnicity People) and Urchuudiin Sum (Temple of Craftsmen). A Zargachiin Yam (Chamber of Judges) located east of the Chinese mosque handled legal affairs of the Chinese. Since 1778 Urga may have had around 10,000 monks. They were regulated by a monastic rule called the Internal Rule of the Grand Monastery or Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto'adu Durem (for example, in 1797 a decree of the 4th Jebtsundamba forbade \\"singing, playing with archery, myagman, chess, usury and smoking\\"). Executions were forbidden where the holy temples of the Bogd Jebtsundama could be seen, so capital punishment was carried out a certain distance away from the city. In 1839 the 5th Bogd Jebtsundamba moved his residence to Gandan Hill, an elevated position to the west of the Baruun Damnuurchin markets. A part of the city was moved to nearby Tolgoit. The reason given for this move was that prevailing north-western winds brought the impure air of the Baruun Damnuurchin markets (known for its many Chinese and Russian shops as well as brothels) onto the inviolably sacred area of the Bogd Jebtsundamba's Zuun Khuree temple complex, located just to the east of the markets. Despite this, in 1855 the part of the camp that moved to Tolgoit was brought back to its 1778 location and the 7th Bogd Jebtsundamba moved back to the Zuun Khuree permanently. The Gandan Monastery flourished as a center of philosophical studies (tsanid). Women were not allowed to enter the area and its Yellow Hat monks were forbidden to go to the lay quarters (khoroo) where Red Hat sect monks freely took wives. Urga was visited by many foreign envoys and travelers, including Egor Fedorovich Timkovskii (1820), N.M.Przhevalsky, Pyotr Kozlov, M. De Bourbolon (1860) and A.M. Pozdneev. The Russian embassy of 130 persons which arrived in Urga in January 1806 included Count Yury Golovkin, Count Jan Potocki, Julius Klaproth and Andrey Yefimovich Martynov.Timkowski, George Travels of the Russian mision through Mongolia to China and residence in Peking in the years 1820-1821 Vol.1, 1827 London, p. 128 In 1863 the Russian Consulate of Urga was opened in a newly built two- storey building on Consul Hill. A small onion-domed Chapel of the Holy Trinity was opened the same year. There were protests from some Urga monks who complained that the Consulate on Consul Hill was higher than the sacred pole of the Bogd Jebtsundamba. Most of the major Mongolian khans and nobles had representative residence quarters in Urga located in the south-east and south- west khoroo lay quarters which they occasionally visited. The south-west lay quarters also included the Tibetan and Buryat quarters and had a number of Red Hat temples, shamanic shrines as well as Yellow Hat temples. The quarters (Amban Khan Khoroo) of the Mongol and Manchu governors of Urga were located in the Zuun Omnod Khoroo (Southeast Khoroo) lay quarters. Potanin A 1913 panorama of Urga.

Urga and the Kyakhta Trade Four-wheeled carriage between Kykhta and Khuree Following the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727 Urga (Ulaanbaatar) was a major point of the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China - mostly Siberian furs for Chinese cloth and later tea. The route ran south to Urga, southeast across the Gobi to Kalgan and southeast over the mountains to Peking. Urga was also a collection point for goods coming from further west. These were either sent to China or shipped north to Russia via Kyakhta because of legal restrictions and the lack of good trade routes to the west. By 1908Lindon Wallace Bates, The Russian Road to China,1910 there was a Russian quarter with a few hundred merchants and a Russian club and informal Russian mayor. East of the main town was the Russian consulate built in 1863 with an Orthodox church, post office and 20 Cossack guards. It was fortified in 1900 and briefly occupied by troops during the Boxer Rebellion. There was a telegraph line north to Kyakhta and southeast to Kalgan and weekly postal service along these routes. Beyond the Russian consulate was the Chinese trading post called Maimaicheng and nearby the palace of the Manchu viceroy. With the growth of Western trade at the Chinese ports the tea trade to Russia declined, some Chinese merchants left and wool became the main export. Manufactured goods still came from Russia but most were now brought from Kalgan by caravan. The annual trade was estimated at 25 million rubles, nine tenths in Chinese hands and one tenth Russian. Communist era Qing Amban (1910-1911) of Urga. Outdoor market near Gandan hill in 1972. State Department Store in the background Green areas were increased in the city center during the communist era. The Moscow trade expedition of the 1910s estimated the population of Urga at 60,000 based on Nikolay Przhevalsky's study in the 1870s.From Khutagtiin Khuree to Niislel Khuree . Presentation of the Director of the General Archives Authority D. Ulziibaatar. The city's population swelled during the Naadam festival and major religious festivals to more than 100,000. In 1919 the number of monks had reached 20,000, up from 13,000 in 1810. In 1910 the amban Sando went to quell a major fight between Gandan lamas and Chinese traders started by an incident at the Da Yi Yu shop in the Baruun Damnuurchin market district. He was unable to bring the lamas under control and was forced to flee back to his quarters. In 1911, with the Qing Dynasty in China headed for total collapse, Mongolian leaders in Ikh Kh√ºree for Naadam met in secret on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and resolved to end 220 years of Manchu control of their country. On December 29, 1911 the 8th Jeptsundamba Khutughtu was declared ruler of an independent Mongolia and assumed the title Bogd Khan. Kh√ºree as the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu was the logical choice for the capital of the new state. However, in the tripartite Kyakhta agreement of 1915 (between Russia, China, Mongolia), Mongolia's status was changed to mere autonomy. In 1919, Mongolian nobles, over the opposition of the Bogd Khan, agreed with the Chinese resident Chen Yi on a settlement of the \\"Mongolian question\\" along Qing-era lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, Kh√ºree was occupied by the troops of Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng, who forced the Mongolian nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely. In 1921 the city changed hands twice. First, on February 4, 1921, a mixed Russian/Mongolian force led by White Russian warlord Roman von Ungern-Sternberg captured the city, freeing the Bogd Khan from Chinese imprisonment and killing a part of the Chinese garrison. Baron Ungern's capture of Urga was followed by clearing out Mongolia's small gangs of demoralized Chinese soldiers and, at the same time, looting and murder of foreigners, including a vicious pogrom that killed off the Jewish community. On February 22, 1921 the Bogd Khan was once again elevated the Great Khan of Mongolia in Urga.Kuzmin, S.L. History of Baron Ungern: an Experience of Reconstruction. Moscow: KMK, 2011, p. 165-200 However, at the same time Baron Ungern was taking control of Urga, a Soviet- supported Communist Mongolian force led by Damdin S√ºkhbaatar was forming up in Russia, and in March they crossed the border. Ungern and his men rode out in May to meet Red Russian and Red Mongolian troops, but suffered a disastrous defeat in June.Kuzmin, p.250-300 In July the Communist Soviet-Mongolian army became the second conquering force in six months to enter Urga. Mongolia came to the control of the Soviet Russia. On October 29, 1924 the town was renamed to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolian \\"red hero\\"), by the advice of T.R. Ryskulov, the Soviet representative in Mongolia. In the socialist period, and especially following the Second World War, most of the old ger districts were replaced by Soviet-style blocks of flats, often financed by the Soviet Union. Urban planning began in the 1950s, and most of the city today is the result of construction from 1960 to 1985.Montsame News Agency. Mongolia. 2006, , p. 33-34 The Transmongolian Railway, connecting Ulaanbaatar with Moscow and Beijing, was completed in 1956, and cinemas, theaters, museums etc. were erected. On the other hand, most of the temples and monasteries of pre- socialist Kh√ºree were destroyed following the anti-religious purges of the late 1930s. The Gandan monastery was reopened in 1944 when US Vice President Henry Wallace asked to see a monastery during his visit to Mongolia. Democratic revolution Ulaanbaatar was the site of demonstrations that led to Mongolia's transition to democracy and market economy in 1990. On December 10, 1989, protesters outside the Youth Culture Centre called for Mongolia to implement perestroika and glasnost in their full sense. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform. On January 14, 1990 the protesters, having grown from two hundred to over a thousand, met at the Lenin Museum in Ulaanbaatar. A demonstration in S√ºkhbaatar Square on Jan. 21 followed. Afterwards, weekend demonstrations in January and February were held accompanied by the forming of Mongolia's first opposition parties. On March 7, ten dissidents assembled in S√ºkhbaatar Square and went on a hunger strike. Thousands of supporters joined them. More came on March 8, and the crowd grew more unruly; seventy people were injured and one killed. On March 9 the communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party government resigned. The provisional government announced Mongolia's first free elections, which were held in July. The MPRP won the election and resumed power.Rossabi, Morris Modern Mongolia: From Khans to Commissars to Capitalists 2005, University of California Press, . pp. 1-28 Since Mongolia's transition to a market economy in 1990, the city has experienced further growth - especially in the ger districts, as construction of new blocks of flats had basically broken down in the 1990s. The population has more than doubled to over one million inhabitants, about 50% of Mongolia's entire population. This causes a number of social, environmental, and transportation problems. In recent years, construction of new buildings has gained new momentum, especially in the city center, and apartment prices have skyrocketed. 2008 protests In 2008, Ulaanbaatar was the scene of riots after the Mongolian Democratic, Civic Will Party and Republican parties disputed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's victory in the parliamentary elections. Approximately 30,000 people took part in a public meeting led by the opposition parties. After the meeting was over some protestors left the central square and moved on to the nearby headquarters of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, attacking and burning the building. A police station was also attacked. At night rioters set fire to the Cultural Palace, where a theatre, museum and National art gallery were vandalised and burned. Torched cars, bank robberies and looting were reported. The organisations in the burning buildings were vandalised and looted. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against stone- throwing protestors. A four-day state of emergency was declared, the capital was placed under a 22:00 to 08:00 curfew, and alcohol sales banned, following which measures rioting did not resume. Five people were killed and hundreds arrested by the police during the suppression of the riots. Human rights groups expressed concerns about the handling of this unprecedented incident by the authorities. Recent developments July 19, 2009 FIM Asian Motocross Championship in Ulaanbaatar After the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement was signed in 2009 the first phase of the Mongolian mining boom started. Ulaanbaatar as the capital of the country came to be labelled one of the world's top frontier investment destinations. From 2009 to 2012 Ulaanbaatar's position rapidly rose in the investment world. Miners and bankers flocked to the city as construction and other sectors boomed. In September 2011 Ulaanbaatar was featured on CNNGo TV - the same year Mongolia had the fastest GDP growth in the world at 17.3%. Developments in the Mongolian parliament in Ulaanbaatar came to be closely watched by foreign investors. The pace of growth slowed after the passing of SEFIL (Strategic Entities Foreign Investment Law) in 2012. Although the law was amended in 2013 the pace of growth has yet to return to previous boom levels. In the meantime Ulaanbaatar has been steadily increasing its international profile on a political and international relations level. Ulaanbaatar has been receiving regular OSCE delegations after Mongolia became a participating state of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe in November 2012. In April 2013 Ulaanbaatar (as capital of the country holding presidency) successfully hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies attended by 1,215 delegates from 104 countries. Aung San Suu Kyi was one of the attendees. It has also hosted the North Korea-Japan talks on abduction issues. In November 2013 Ulaanbaatar organized the first Meeting of Women Parliamentarians of Northeast Asian Countries. In June 2014 it hosted the first international conference of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security. In August 2014 Ulaanbaatar hosted the Northeast Asian Mayors' Forum and became sister cities with Beijing. In August and September 2014 Ulaanbaatar was visited by both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. In 2016 Ulaanbaatarwill host the 11th Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM Summit). Ulaanbaatar also started hosting international music concerts in large stadiums. Michael Learns to Rock, ONYX and the Korean K-pop group T-ara have all performed in Ulaanbaatar. Previously only little known Russian pop stars used to come. The city has become increasingly Anglophone and English signs are common on streets and billboards. Korean culture also has a strong influence in the city as reflected in the numerous Korean businesses in the city center and the adoption of Korean styles among a large number of urban youth.

A descendant of Jews who fled Portugal during the time of the Portuguese Inquisition, his family eventually came to settle in Egypt. A student of the illustrious Radbaz (Rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra), he is considered the last Chief Rabbi of Egypt to hold sway over the entire Jewish community in Egypt, mostly Musta'arabi Jews, after the abolition of the office of nagid, and whose halachic rulings were widespread across the land. He was a nephew (not a son, as had been believed) of the master of the mint for the Ottoman Sultan in Cairo, Abraham de Castro. Biography In his youth, he studied under the tutelage of Rabbi Levi ibn Habib in Jerusalem. Later, in Egypt, Rabbi Yaakov de Castro served as a judge in the rabbinic court of Cairo, known as Old Egypt. In 1570, he visited Safed in the land of Israel, where he was the honored guest in the home of Rabbi Joseph Karo, who held him in great esteem.Encyclopedia of Great Men in Israel (ed. Mordechai Margalioth), vol. 3, Jerusalem 1948, p. 881 (Hebrew) He describes this visit by saying that he saw Rabbi Joseph Karo practise in accordance with the first opinion that he brings down in one of the topics addressed in his seminal work, the Shulhan Arukh.\`Erekh Le·∏•em, Ora·∏• ·∏§ayyim, responsum # 167 The author of Korei ha-Dorot mentions that during Rabbi Yaakov de Castro‚Äôs visit to Safed he died there.David Ashkenazi Konforti, Korei ha-Dorot, Berlin 1845, pp. 41a-b The author of ·π¨uv Mi·π£rayyim, however, refutes this claim, saying that Rabbi de Castro returned to Egypt and there died, citing evidence from his own writings (Responsa) where Rabbi de Castro describes his encounter with Rabbi Joseph Karo, author of the Shulhan Arukh, while in Safed, and that he had composed a second book (a commentary on the Shulhan Arukh) after he had completed his Responsa, and that both books were written in Egypt.Raphael Aharon Ben Shimon, ·π¨uv Mi·π£rayyim, Jerusalem 1908, (letter ‚Äúyod‚Äù), s.v. ◊û◊î◊®\\"◊® ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë ◊ß◊©◊ò◊®◊ï, pp.19b‚Äì20a (Hebrew). Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai, in his work Shem ha- Gedolim, takes the same position, citing the grandson of Rabbi de Castro who claims that the Rabbi died in Egypt in [5]370 anno mundi (1610 CE), and that his signature was appended to a court document as late as 1606.Chaim Yosef David Azulai, Shem ha-Gedolim (part ii), letter yod, section 122, Livorno 1786, p. 46b.

He also wrote a commentary on the Tractate Betzah (Yom ·π¨ov), which was published post-mortem under the name Toldot Yaakov (Jerusalem 1865), a book entitled \\"Hilkot Nazirut\\", and a number of similar writings on Talmudic subjects, published by Jacob Hagis in his \\"Halakot Ketanot\\", Venice, 1704, as well as other manuscripts which were either unpublished or are no longer extant.Raphael Aharon Ben Shimon, ·π¨uv Mi·π£rayyim, Jerusalem 1908, (letter ‚Äúyod‚Äù), s.v. ◊û◊î◊®\\"◊® ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë ◊ß◊©◊ò◊®◊ï, p.19b (Hebrew). Some of the questions addressed to the Rabbi came from Jewish communities in distant places, such as Yemen,See, for example, Yaakov Castro, Ohalei Yaakov, responsum # 121, Livorno 1783 (Hebrew). The responsum, written in 1604 CE, concerns a bill of sale for the lands of a vineyard, but held in abeyance until after the picking season, and where the buyer came along during that growing season and picked grapes for making wine when the vineyard had not yet been fully vested unto him. A question arose whether or not there was, in this case, the vestiges of usury, for which Rabbi Castro was asked to give an opinion. and Thessaloniki. Rabbi Castro's Responsa are a primary source for knowledge of the Jewish community in Egypt during those years. Manner of adjudication Rabbi Yaakov de Castro's impact was so profound that, in Egypt, they would follow the halachic rulings of Rabbi Castro even in those places where he disagreed with the Shulhan Arukh.Encyclopedia of Great Men in Israel (ed. Mordechai Margaliouth), vol. 3, Jerusalem 1948, pp. 881‚Äì882 (Hebrew). It has been noted that many of his rulings in \`Erekh Le·∏•em coincide with the commentary (gloss) on the Shulhan Arukh written by Rabbi Moses Isserles, although Rabbi Castro most- likely never saw his writings. Rabbi Castro composed his commentary on the Shulhan Arukh before Rabbi Moses Isserles' gloss was sent to the publishers.Encyclopedia of Great Men in Israel (ed.

Benjamin Holt Rice, a missionary of the London Missionary Society (LMS), a Canarese scholar and a pioneer of education in the Bangalore Pete region. The Rice Memorial Church stands on a busy street in the midst of temple, dargahs, book shops and heavy traffic, with its colonial British structure appearing to be out of place in the traditional Bangalore market district. The church stands on the site of the London Mission Canarese Chapel built by Rev. Rice, which itself was built on the site of the first Canarese chapel built by William Campbell in 1834. The church is a stone building in the European Classical style, with Tuscan columns, pediments and keystone arch windows. The church building has been demolished and raised at least 3 times, with the current structure consecrated in 1917. Heritage conservationists have been increasingly urging authorities to include the church, along with other important landmarks on the heritage list, as these monuments are being increasingly threatened by the development of Bangalore City. There has been proposals for widening of Avenue Road, which would result in damage or loss of the Rice Memorial Church and other monuments. The Rice Memorial is part of the proposed 'Palace-to-Palace' Heritage Corridor (or Golden Corridor), linking Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace (on Albert Victoria Road) to the Bangalore Palace, passing through KR Road, Avenue Road and Palace Road. The corridor proposed by Bangalore's well known architect Naresh Narasimhan, with consultations from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has however has not been accepted by the Government of Karnataka. Benjamin Holt Rice Students of the London Mission Girls' Boarding School (now Mithralaya School), Bangalore in 1867 Benjamin Holt Rice was born on 28 May 1814 to Simon Peter Rice, who had a business of wholesale woolen drapers. Benjamin attended school till the age of 13 and showed great interest in the study of scriptures, religion and poetry. He started working as a clerk in a lawyer's office at the age of 13. Then at 15, he joined his uncle's counting house business. He became drawn towards religion and joined a church at 15, and in 1834 joined the Homerton College at Hackney. Graduating in 1836, he married Jane Peach Singer from Islington, and was appointed as a missionary to South India by the London Missionary Society. Rice along with his wife arrived at Madras on 29 December 1836 along with a batch of London Mission missionaries. They left for Bangalore on the night of 6 January 1837, accompanied by their fellow missionaries, travelling in five palanquins and accompanied by 70 bearers. The journey from Madras to Bangalore took a week‚Äôs time. Rice joined the Bangalore Mission of the London Missionary Society, which consisted of the Canarese circuit which was considered to be conservative and caste-ridden in the Bangalore Peta area ruled by the Maharaja of Mysore, and the Tamil circuit which was considered to be progressive and the English circuit for the British Officers, both in the Bangalore Cantonment which was under the British Madras Presidency. Within 9 months of his arrival, Rice was able to learn the Canarese language, and starting preaching in that language in the Bangalore Peta region. Rice also mastered Tamil and also preached in that language. Benjamin Rice in 1860 Benjamin Rice In 1840, Mrs. Sewell, wife of Rev. James Sewell, opened the first Canarese Girls School for the natives at the Bangalore Peta. It was the first time native girls were able to attend school in this region. Rice prepared the textbooks in Canarese for teaching Geography and Arithmetic. In 1842, Rice and his wife started boarding at the Canarese School. The school still exists today, located on Mission Road (named after the London Mission), Bangalore and is now called the Mitralaya Girls High School . The school was supervised by Jane Rice till her death in 1864, when the school had around 400 girl students. After the death of Jane, Benjamin married Catherine Muller, a widow of the German missionary Rev. J J Muller, and daughter of Rev. C T E Rhenius (both of the Church Missionary Society, who served at Suviseshapuram in Tinnevelly). Catherine took charge of the boarding school along with her daughter Harriet. Catherine died in 1887, after which Harriet Muller took official charge of the boarding house, serving till 1911 when she retired. To impart English education, in 1847, Rice established the Anglo-Vernacular School at Sultanpet, Bangalore, with 100 students. By 1859, there were 397 students, and the school moved into a new building. In January 1877, a service to commemorate Rice's 50 years of service to the mission in India was celebrated at London Mission Chapel, Infantry Road, Bangalore. A month after that, he died and was buried at the New Cemetery, Hosur Road, Bangalore. During his lifetime, Rice wrote many treatises on Hinduism, Christianity, Indian literature and about India, both in English and Canarese. Rice also translated and composed many Canarese hymns which are still being used today in Kannada churches. He also served in the revision committee for the Canarese Bible for 19 years. Benjamin Holt Rice is often confused with his son, Benjamin Lewis Rice, a scholar of Canarese, Tamil and Grantha, who compiled the 12 volume Epigraphia Carnatica, recording the ancient inscriptions in the Kingdom of Mysore, and the Mysore Gazette. The works of Benjamin Holt Rice is part of the Rice Papers Collection of the Cambridge University, donated by his son. Jane Peach Rice, the wife of Benjamin Rice died on 11 March 1864, aged 57 years, and is buried at the Agram Protestant Cemetery in Bangalore. The Agram cemetery also has the graves of Mary Ann Hodson wife of Thomas Hodson of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who died on 10 August 1866 aged 68, Catherine wife of Matthew Trevan Male of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who died on 29 August 1865 aged 49, Fanny Lees child of Catherine and Matthew Male born 29 January 1861 and died 24 April 1861, and Rev. Alexander Maceallum, Missionary of the Free Church of Scotland died 10 June 1862. Campbell's Petah Chapel, 1834 The Main Street of the Pettah, Bangalore, 1890 London Mission Chapel, Infantry Road, Bangalore Cantonment where Tamil and English Services were held, 1839 In 1834, William Campbell of the London Mission raised a chapel on Infantry Road (between St. Andrew's Church and St. Paul's, currently Gem Plaza) in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, incurring a cost of BINR 8000 raised by public subscription, where services were held in Tamil, English and Canarese. In the same year, Campbell obtained land in the main thoroughfare of the Bangalore Petah and a Canarese Chapel was raised and the Canarese services was moved there. The chapel also served as a school and venue for religious discussions with the locals. In 1835, Campbell left for England, leaving the Canarese Chapel in the hands of the native Canarese converts. In 1837, the Canarese chapel was dissolved by Rev. Benjamin Rice and Rev. Colin Campbell, after serious internal conflict within the native congregation on the lines of caste. An inquiry exposed the full scale of the problem, with native converts still adhering to caste hierarchies which was unacceptable to the Mission. In the same year, a regular services re-commenced in the Petah Chapel starting on the occasion of Lord's Day. In 1839, the Petah Chapel was extended to accommodate the growing congregation. In 1845, there was a further extension, and the chapel was also used as an English day school. Due to increase in the size of the congregation, the chapel was razed down to make way for building the new larger Canarese Chapel at the Bangalore Petah. Canarese Chapel, Bangalore, 1851 In 1851, the Canarese Chapel was raised on the grounds where Campbell's chapel stood. The building was much larger than the original chapel and was raised at a cost of BINR 3500 (¬£350), raised from the proceeds of the sale of the Mission House in Mysore. The opening of the New Canarese Chapel at Bangalore was reported by Rev. Campbell, Rev. Rice and Rev. Sewell and published in the Missionary Magazine and Chronicle of April 1852, along with a sketch. The chapel stood as an impressive European Hall in the midst of native mud houses. The dimensions of the chapel were length of 53 feet, width of 32 feet and height of 20 feet. There was an verandah outside, which served for addressing the natives during weekdays, and vestry attached to the building. There was also an dwelling house for the native teacher and his family. The chapel was consecrated on 19 October 1851, with the opening services commenced by Rev. Rice. Others in attendance included Rev. Daniel Sanderson of the Wesleyan Mission, Rev. James Sewell, Rev C Campbell, many other Europeans and many prominent residents of the Bangalore Petah. In 1907, the Canarese Chapel was deemed as being structurally unsafe and was vacated.

In 1912, the building plan for the new church was ready, but funding was delayed by the directors of the London Missionary Society. The foundation to the new church was laid on the grounds of the old Canarese Chapel on 13 November 1913 by Mrs. E P Rice and Dr. Horton. However, shortly after that the Bangalore Peta Municipality wanted to widen the Peta (Avenue) Road and wanted 15 ft. of frontage to be maintained. With the new regulations, it was impossible to build the church. The Municipality offered an alternate site for the church, and after persistent negotiations over 2 years, helped acquire the adjoining property, hence making available space for a larger church building. A sum of BINR 3500 was contributed by the native Indians for the building fund. The completed Rice Memorial Church was formally opened by Mrs. Blake, the daughter of Rev. Benjamin Rice on 27 January 1917. A silver key was presented to Mrs. Blake on this occasion. The inauguration service was conducted by Rev. Geo Wilkins. Others in attendance included * H D Rice, grandson of Rev. Rice * Rev. Lewis R Scudder, President, South India United Church (SIUC) * Rev. R A Hickling, President, Canarese Church Council * Rev.

A special communion service was held on 29 January 2017 as part of the 100 years celebrations. This service was attended the descendants of Rev. Rice, Douglas Walthew Rice, his wife, Alison, and his son, Benjamin Rice, who came from London especially to attend the service. The service was held in Kannada, and was attended by people of different faiths. Some of the others taking part in the celebrations were Bishop(Retd) Rev. Balmi from Dharwad, Bishop B K Nayak from Odisha, Rev. Dr. Rathnakar Sadananda, Rev. M M George and Rev. S Sujeeth Kumar. Palace-to-Palace Heritage Corridor The 'Palace-to-Palace' Heritage Corridor was proposed by architect Naresh Narasimhan of Venkataramanan Associates, in consultation by INTACH, to create a heritage zone, protecting old monuments and banning of new modern constructions. The proposed corridor started at the City Institute on Krishna Rajendra Road (KR Road), cutting through Makkala Koota, Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace, Victoria Hospital, Bangalore Fort, entering Avenue Road crossing Rice Memorial, hitting Mysore Bank Circle, continuing on to Palace Road going past Maharani's College, SJI Polytechnic, Central College, Carlton House, KPSC building, stretching till the reservoir, Raj Bhavan, Balabrooie, and Manikyavelu Mansion and ending at Bangalore Palace. Other historic monuments and landmarks to be included in corridor are Mount Carmel College, Bangalore Golf Club, Freedom Park, Bangalore University City Campus, University Law College, Mysore Bank, Historic Centre of Bangalore, Krishna Rajendra Market (KR Market or City Market), St. Luke's Church, Bangalore Medical College and Bangalore Fort High School. However the proposal has not been accepted by the Government of Karnataka.

The only known species is the type Muiscasaurus catheti.  Discovery  The fossils of Muiscasaurus were found in the Paja Formation, whose sediments are exposed near the town of Villa de Leyva in Boyac√° Department. These remains were found in 2010 in the middle of a limestone concretion, known as the Arcillolitas abigarradas Member, dating from the Barremian to Aptian epochs of the Lower Cretaceous. Although ammonites were found attached to the fossils, their poor preservation prevented identifying them and thereby establish the stratigraphy and precise age of the specimen. The fossil found, listed as the holotype specimen CIP- FCG-CBP-74, consists of a partial skull and some vertebrae with ribs that were found associated with the skull. These remains were designated in 2015 as the new genus and species Muiscasaurus catheti; the genus name being a reference to the Muisca of central Colombia, with the Latinized Greek word saurus, \\"reptile\\". The species name, catheti, means perpendicular and refers to the shape of the nostrils. The remains were prepared for the Centro de Investigaciones Paleontol√≥gicas (Paleontological Research Center) in Villa de Leyva. Description The Muiscasaurus fossils corresponds to a juvenile individual, given the incomplete ossification of the vertebrae and the proportions of the skull. This lacks the front of the snout, as well as in the back of the skull, showing some crushing to the right side. The jaw elements are very thin and long, with some teeth preserved, which are relatively small. Muiscasaurus was a relatively large animal: the preserved skull length is , and, depending on its exact proportions, could be between total cranial length. This individual could reach long and up to long in adults. Like all advanced ichthyosaurs, Muiscasaurus must had a compact and streamlined body, with a tail shaped like a half moon and all four legs transformed into flippers. Muiscasaurus differs from its closest relatives by a combination of features: it had a very thin premaxilla, the nasal aperture is partially divided in two ovals for a spur-shaped nasal process, with the frontal portion in vertical position and the rear one horizontal; in other ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs, the aperture was fully open or fully separated into two. The posterior region was narrow and provided with a thin quadratojugal, the teeth were very thin and lacking of the thick enamel and the coarse striations, whereas in similar ichthyosaurs as Pervushovisaurus and Platypterygius had more robust teeth and grooves in the enamel. Phylogeny Muiscasaurus was described based on fossils that were classified as belonging to the Ophthalmosauridae family, which includes most of the ichthyosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Muiscasaurus seems particularly occupied a very basal position within the family, with respect to the subgroup composed by Platypterygius, Caypullisaurus and Brachypterygius (although the latter two genera were slightly older than Muiscasaurus itself) . Cladogram based in the phylogenetic analysis of Maxwell et al., 2015:  Paleobiology  In addition to Muiscasaurus, in the Paja Formation has been recovered other kind of ichthyosaur, Platypterygius sachicarum; it is distinguished of Muiscasaurus for their teeth and cranial features, including thicker, robust teeth with grooved tooth enamel. The analysis could indicate that while P. sachicarum probably had a generalist diet, Muiscasaurus was a much more specialized form, feeding on smaller and softer prey items. This would show that during the Cretaceous period in the neotropics, ichthyosaurs kept some ecological diversity.

Early life  Elizabeth Campbell, known as \\"Bessie\\", was born on 21 July 1870 in Melbourne, Australia. She is from an Irish and Anglican background and is the daughter of Christopher Campbell, a former employee for Madam Tussaud in Dublin, and Eliza n√©e McMullen who was his second wife. Christopher and his wife migrated to Melbourne in 1849. In the early 1870s their family moved to Sydney as he continued his work in the waxworks industry.  Education  When Bessie was 14 years old, she went to London with her parents. Whilst there she was taught the banjo by Joe Daniels and documented that, \\"she took a great fancy to the five stringed banjo\\". The year after the family returned to Sydney where she remained learning the banjo for three more months from the American Hosea Easton.  Career  Bessie Campbell started to come out and play her banjo in charity concerts from 1891. In about September 1893 she played a solo at the American Banjo Club's concert at the Centenary Hall, York Street, in assistance of the Seamen's Mission.Bessie began to appear in concerts for charity not money. Her success was so big that by 1897 she was titled \\"Australia's greatest lady banjoist\\". Bessie had become the first female member to join the \\"American Banjo Club\\", which was founded by Stent in 1892. On average, she received six to eight letters a week wanting her to perform at concerts great and small. In April 1904 she was compensated five guineas for performing at the Bathurst Agricultural Show. Bessie was titled as \\"The Banjo Queen\\" in 1907, and toured the northern rivers with the National Concert Company. Her songs consisted of Christy-minstrel songs and Negro spirituals in her collection and was regularly accompanied by her sister on the piano.  Charity work  At one of her charity shows, one critic found her \\"a wonder for she plays the banjo with so much ability as to render it almost a classical instrument\\". During World War I, at the crest of her career, she gave numerous performances for servicemen and the Australian Red Cross Society. After the war had ended, Bessie performed at many charity shows for the Western Suburbs Leagues Club and the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League. In the 1920s she was the honorary secretary of the Wanderers Club, and was involved in charitable work for them and Burwood Municipal Council.  Personal life  Bessie was diagnosed with arthritis in the early 1930s, and this was making it challenging for her to play and she had never made commercial recordings ever since. Bessie was a great fan of cricket. Bessie Campbell was considered as a beautiful woman and consistently had suitors.  Death  Bessie died an unmarried woman on 28 April 1964 at Burwood, New South Wales and was buried in the Anglican section of Rookwood cemetery.

Early life  Dolly Nampijinpa Daniels was born in 1936 at Warlukurlangu, north-west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. She was born in the Australian bush and maintained a spiritual connection to her homeland throughout her life. The meaning of home for Daniels encompassed both the geographical and social landscapes of her home country. Daniels lived for many years as a traditional nomad, hunting with her family, before moving with her husband to Mt. Doreen station after the death of her father and then onto Yuendumu, an area approximately 300 km north-west of Alice Springs. Alongside a number of Warlipiri people, she was forcibly removed from these lands by authorities and trucked to Lajamanu, another government settlement, but eventually made the journey back to Yuendumu where they settled.  Personal life  Daniels was an active member in the Yuendumu community, a proud Warlipiri speaker and was recognised as ‚Äòboss‚Äô for the women‚Äôs ceremonies in her area. She was once described by Galarrwuy Yunupingu as a person ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt talk much, but had a strong presence and knows who she is and what she‚Äôs doing‚Äù. Whilst Daniels was a traditional Warlpiri woman, she also showed an early interest in promoting Warlpiri culture beyond the confines of the settlement . Through marriage and family ties Daniels was able to gain fluency in languages and rituals beyond Yuendumu. She went on to use this extensive knowledge to not only educate the Warlipiri, but numerous non-Aboriginal researchers as well, helping several people in the process.  Art  Daniels began painting in the 1980s with the anthropologist Francoise Dussart. She began by painting ancestral designs on acrylic canvas in a style that has become known as Aboriginal ‚Äòdot‚Äô painting. Her paintings adhere very strongly to traditional templates for painting, but creativity can be seen in the handling of the painting, arrangement of the motifs and size and placement of the dots. Her work is made most distinguishable due to their bright colours and intricate patterns. Her works celebrate Australian Aboriginal Dreaming and culture and thoroughly invoked the Warlipiri concepts of ‚Äòcountry‚Äô, ‚Äòhome‚Äô and ‚Äòcamp‚Äô in her work. She painted both her own and her father‚Äôs dreamings and states ‚Äúit is our story - Aboriginal people‚Äôs story‚Äù. She was part of the South Australian Museum‚Äôs Yuendumu. In her mission to promote Warlpiri culture, Daniels helped found and subsequently chair the Warlukurlangu Artists Association and Art Centre , which continues to thrive as one of the longest running and most successful Aboriginal-owned art centres in Central Australia. = Exhibitions = Daniels‚Äô first exhibited her work in 1985 at the Araluen Arts Centre in Alice Springs. It was from here that she gained world-renowned acclaim. Her major exhibitions and collaborations are listed below : * ‚ÄúWarlukurlangu Arts‚Äù, 1986 onwards, Yuendumu collaboration. * ‚ÄúYuendumu: Paintings out of the Desert‚Äù, March 1988, South Australian Museum, Adelaide, South Australia. * ‚ÄúDreamings: Art of Aboriginal Australia‚Äù, 1988, New York, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Adelaide. * ‚ÄúL‚Äô√©t√© Australien‚Äù 1990, Mus√©e Fabre, Montepellier, France. * ‚ÄúFrames Of Reference: Aspects of Feminism and Art‚Äù, 1991. * ‚ÄúTop Heavy‚Äù Sutton Gallery, May 1993, Dolly Nampijinpa Daniels/Anne Mosey collaboration. * ‚ÄúBiennale Celebration‚Äù , 1993, Sydney. * Aratjara Indigenous Art, Kunstsammlung Norhrheinwestphalein, D√ºsseldorf , 1993. * ‚ÄúNgurra‚Äù (camp/home/country), 1994, Dolly Nampijinpa Daniels/Anne Mosey Collaboration. A selection of her work is permanently on exhibition in the National Gallery Of Victoria , AM Gallery, Warlukurlangu Arts Centre and the National Museum of African and Oceanic Art, Paris. = Influences = One of the major influences on Daniels‚Äô art has been collaborator, Anne Mosey, also a renowned artist. The pair first met in Central Australia in 1989 and exchanged ideas on modes of representing country and the cultural meaning behind such practices. They have collaborated on several internationally recognised projects, whilst still remaining faithful to their own cultures. Daniels‚Äô family have also had an influential role in her life, particularly her younger sister Evelyn who often painted with Daniels before her death.  Land Rights Activism  Daniels was also a proud land rights activist who was particularly interested in the rights of Indigenous Australian people and their lands. She fought strongly for the rights of Aboriginals to have access to their land in order to live a traditional and sustainable way of life. In her work she maintained strong ties to the Central Land Council and was a key participant in the famous land claims of 1976 and 1984, which returned large tracts of the Central Australian desert back to the Warlpiri people. Daniels and her team lodged a complaint in December 2000 regarding the area around New Haven Pastoral Station in the case \\"Nelson v Northern Territory of Australia FCA 1343\\". In December 2010 it was decided by the federal court that the request would be accepted in the form of a free agreement, as outlined by the team, the area held importance to the Jipalpa- Wintijaru, Pikilyi, Yarripilngu, Karrinyarra and Winparrku landholding groups, to which Daniels had ties to.  Publications and Community Service  Daniels wrote a dreaming narrative, titled ‚ÄúThe Magic Fire of Warlukurlangu‚Äù, which was published by Kingswood Working Title Press in 2003. The book was aimed towards primary school aged children and retells a traditional tale of Daniels' Dreaming area. This book has been used to educate non-Indigenous children of the Dreamings and their significance. In her service to the community, Daniels was a loyal member of the Yuendumu night patrol, as locals were concerned about the way in which Aboriginal issues become processed through bureaucracies.  Death  Dolly Nampijinpa Daniels died of cancer in November 2004 surrounded by her kin.

Lola was a strong advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were forcibly removed from their families.  Early life  Lola Edwards grew up in Tingha, NSW. Her mother was a Ngarabal and father was a Kamilaroi. Her father was what Aboriginal people would call an 'old bush lawyer' and would regularly be an advocate for Aboriginal people in court. Lola and her family always believed this was the reason they were taken. When Lola Edwards was four years old, in 1951 she was taken away with her older and younger sisters and her brother Gordon from her family by the Aboriginal Welfare board. They were picked up and taken to the train at Inverell to Sydney, her brother Gordon was separated at Central Railway Station, then Lola and her sisters were put on the train to Cootamundra. Lola didn't see her mother until many years after and never met her father as he died before she was released.  Cootamundra Girls Home  Lola Edward spent 11 years at the Cootamundra Girls Training Home in NSW where she was taken after being removed from her family. Cootamundra Aboriginal Girls Training Home opened from 1912 and closed in 1969. Girls there were trained to be domestic servants like Lola and others were trained to be telephonists and then worked at the home and others did typist courses. Lola did not go back to visit the home until 1980, 31 years after she was placed there. In an interview in 2008, Lola recalled that another girl at the home used to talk to herself at night in bed and told Lola she was trying to remember her language under the blankets. Lola also said that she believed she and the other girls at the home where being raised \\"to think white and act white and keep herself clean, scrub her skin, take the black off her skin.\\"  Work  When Lola was 16 she was placed out to work in the township of Junee, where looked after a baby and a little boy. The couple she worked for owned a local taxi service and Lola would clean the house, do the washing, do the cooking and man the taxi base. Years later she married and moved to San Francisco, United States. While she was living in San Francisco she got a phone call from her sister asking if she wanted to come down and meet her mother. The reunification with her mother made Lola decide to move back to Australia and find out more about her family and lost culture. Lola's sister then started Link-Up with Dr Peter Read and Lola became very passionate about the organisation. When Lola started her work with Link-Up, she was required to go down and do the searches for people who asked them to, for their files at the state records. Lola was then asked to be a member of the Indigenous Advisory Council for the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families' led by former Human Rights Commissioner and Commission President, the late Sir Ronald Wilson, and former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson. Lola also played a critical role in ensuring the stories of the Stolen Generations were heard. The Commission's 1997 report 'Bringing Them Home' was the result of this Inquiry. Her contribution to this Inquiry, along with her lifetime of advocacy, has contributed to ensuring that this part of Australia's history is acknowledged and known by all Australians.  Achievements  Lola Edwards has won the Tony Fitzgerald Memorial Award at the annual Australian Human Rights Commission's Human Rights Awards in Sydney on 9 December 2011. The award recognises individuals with a proven track record in promoting and advancing human rights in the Australian community on a not-for- profit basis. Bill Edwards, her husband who accepted the award, said: ‚ÄúThis is a true acknowledgement of Lola‚Äôs lifetime passion of seeking social justice for Aboriginal people and especially for those members of the Stolen Generations who continue to be disadvantaged.‚Äù In 1995‚Äì96, together with the late Carol Kendall, Lola was appointed to the specialist team for Link-up (NSW) which travelled extensively throughout NSW conducting 30 preparatory forums to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including members of the Stolen Generations, to give evidence to the Australian Human Rights Commission's Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal People from Their Families. Lola was also the inaugural chairperson of the National Sorry Day Committee.

Childhood  Watson was born on 9 November 1931, in Rockhampton, Queensland, her mother's Kungulu country and attended school in the Dawson Valley, where she involved herself heavily in sport. In 1944, at the age of 13, she was forced to leave her education after obtaining a serious injury falling off a horse. During adolescence, she worked alongside her father and developed skills in shooting kangaroos, trapping dingos, mustering, droving and branding cattle, picking cotton, planting seed crops, driving tractors and bulldozing. Throughout her childhood, her family and visitors talked of political and social issues, which with her natural storytelling ability, assisted her in the rest of her life.  Personal life  In 1952, at the age of 21, Watson married Harold Bayles, a Wakka Wakka man from Eidsvold, Queensland. Together they had five sons and, in 1970 together with her family, she moved to Brisbane. She joined the growing Aboriginal rights movement and commenced an arts degree at the University of Queensland. She was a founding member of a number of Indigenous organisations including Radio Redfern (now Koori Radio) and the Aboriginal people's gallery.  Political activism  In 1982, along with her brother, Ross, Watson attended and was at the forefront of the Aboriginal protests at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The protesters gathered and marched in Musgrave Park in South Brisbane, because they wanted the Aborigines Act removed, as Queensland was the last state to retain it. Hundreds of people were arrested, including Maureen who was arrested three times. Achievements and community contributions  = Books = Watson produced an audiobook of numerous children's stories in 1994, called From Dreamtime to Spaceships. She created a children's picture book, Kaiyu's Waiting: An Aboriginal Story, illustrated by David Verral, and published in 1984. = Poetry = Watson had a strong interest in both theatre and poetry. This helped her create numerous pieces of poetry, her first collection being published in 1982. In her poetry, she describes how Aboriginal people are viewed by the rest of society as well as how they view the modern world. * Black Child, written in 1977, poetry * I Too Am Human, written in 1977, poetry * Black Reflections, written in 1982, short stories and poetry * Memo to J.C, written in 1988, poetry * Female of the Species, written in 1988, poetry * Stepping Out, written in 1988, poetry * Don't Bash the Loving Out of Me, written in 1995, poetry * Kangaroo, Kangaroo, Where Have You Been? : Nursery Rhymes and Storytelling, written in 1999, an autobiography poetry prose dreaming story = Involvement in theatre industry = Watson was involved in the theatre industry as an actor, vocalist, narrativist, adaptor and writer. Performances took her on tours throughout Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria as well as other places around the globe. The plays she contributed to include: * Vocalist in ‚ÄúNew Sky‚Äù, October 1983, performed at Playhouse, Newcastle, New South Wales * Narrated in \\"Mundu Nyuringu\\", 1983, a film by Robert Bropho * Acted in \\"Honey Spot\\", July 1988, performed at Cremorne Theatre, South Brisbane, Queensland as well as numerous other theatres through New South Wales and Victoria * Adaptor in \\"You Came to My Country But You Didn't Turn Black\\", 1990, performed at the Queensland Museum, in South Bank, Queensland * Wrote \\"Through Murri Eyes\\", September 1992, performed at the Jagera Arts Centre, South Brisbane, Queensland * Acted in \\"Little White Dress\\", June 1996, performed at Performing Arts Centre, Southbank, Queensland * Wrote and acted in \\"Kickin' Up the Dust\\", May 1998, performed at Swinburne University, Hawthorn, Victoria = Gallery = In 1981, she moved to Sydney, where she set up the Aboriginal peoples gallery in Redfern. It was difficult to get permission for the gallery. The shop was not aimed at making a profit, it was more for those who wanted to put their work on display and to express who they are through their art work. = Radio = Watson was a driving force behind the development of the indigenous broadcasting in Sydney community radio. With her son, Tiga Bayles, she laid the foundation of Radio Redfern in 1981. Radio Redfern was allowed 10 hours of airtime weekly. Radio Skid Row gave them this opportunity because they were allocated a community broadcasting licence in 1984. The station was initially broadcast from the University of Sydney, but then later moved to a terrace house on Cope Street in Redfern, still under the license of 2RSR. The station was considered the voice for Aboriginal people in Sydney. In 1988 it played a big role in co- ordinating political protests against the Bicentennial celebrations and Aboriginal deaths in custody in the early 1990s. Radio Redfern grew to have 40 broadcast hours each week, with all the announcers contributing their time voluntarily. = Awards = Watson was the recipient of numerous honours, including the United Nations Association Global Leadership Prize in 1996, for her labour in contributing to creating a cross-cultural understanding and harmony amongst the community. In 1996, in recognition of her national and international contribution towards bringing awareness to Aboriginal arts, she was presented the Australia Council's Red Ochre Award. = Work with Sisters Inside = An experienced and qualified neuro-linguistic programming counsellor, Watson worked with Sisters Inside, an independent support group for women in prison.  Death  On 4 January 2009, at approximately 3 pm, Watson had a stroke which proved fatal. In the days before her death, she spent time with her 24 grandchildren and numerous great grandchildren on Stradbroke Island. Her funeral service took place on 12 January 2009 at Murri School in Acacia Ridge, Queensland.

It stars Trevante Rhodes, Andr√© Holland, Janelle Mon√°e, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali. The film presents three stages in the life of the main character: his childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. It explores the difficulties he faces with his sexuality and identity, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures growing up. Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016 by A24, receiving universal acclaim and grossing over $65 million worldwide. Moonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century. The film won several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama and the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Supporting Actor for Ali and Best Adapted Screenplay for Jenkins and McCraney from a total of eight nominations. It became the first film with an all-black cast, the first LGBTQ-related film, and the second-lowest-grossing film domestically (behind The Hurt Locker) to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Joi McMillon became the first black woman to be nominated for an editing Oscar, and Ali became the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar. Plot =I. Little= In Liberty City, Miami at the height of the crack epidemic, Afro- Cuban drug dealer Juan finds Chiron, a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname \\"Little,\\" hiding from a group of bullies in a crackhouse. Juan lets Chiron spend the night with him and his girlfriend Teresa before returning Chiron to his mother Paula, who revokes his TV privileges for worrying her. Chiron continues to spend time with Juan, who teaches him how to swim and mentors him, telling him he can choose his own path in life. One night, Juan encounters Paula smoking crack with one of his customers. Juan berates her for her addiction and for neglecting her son, but she rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place; all the while they argue over Chiron's upbringing. She implies that she knows why Chiron gets tormented by his peers, alluding to \\"the way he walks,\\" before going home and taking out her frustration on Chiron. The next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother and asks what a \\"faggot\\" is. Juan tells him it is \\"a word used to make gay people feel bad.\\" He tells Chiron there is nothing wrong with being gay and that he should not allow others to mock him. Chiron then asks Juan whether he sells drugs and whether his mother does drugs, and leaves after Juan sadly answers yes to both questions. =II. Chiron= Now a teenager, Chiron juggles avoiding school bully Terrel and spending time with Teresa, who has lived alone since Juan's death. Paula, who has turned to prostitution as a result of her worsening addiction, forces Chiron to give her the money he receives from Teresa. Chiron's childhood friend Kevin tells him about a detention he received for being caught having sex with a girl in a school stairwell, and Chiron later dreams about Kevin and the girl having sex in Teresa's back yard, waking with a start. One night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a blunt together, the two discuss their ambitions and the nickname Kevin gave Chiron when they were children. They kiss, and Kevin masturbates Chiron. The next morning, Terrel manipulates Kevin into participating in a hazing ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he is unable to stand before watching as Terrel and other boys savagely attack him. When the principal urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, saying that reporting them will not solve anything. The next day, an enraged Chiron walks into class and smashes a chair over Terrel's head. The police arrive and arrest Chiron for assault, and he is sent to juvenile hall. =III. Black= Now going by the nickname \\"Black,\\" an adult Chiron deals drugs in Atlanta. He receives frequent calls from Paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she now lives. One day, Kevin calls, inviting him to visit him should he ever come to Miami. While visiting Paula, Chiron breaks his silence. His mother apologizes for not loving him when he needed it most and tells him she loves him even if he does not love her back. The two tearfully reconcile before Paula lets Chiron go. Chiron travels to Miami and visits Kevin at his workplace, a diner. When his attempts to probe Chiron about his life result in silence, Kevin tells him he's had a child with an ex-girlfriend and, although the relationship ended, he is fulfilled by his role as a father. Chiron reciprocates by talking about his unexpected drug dealing, and asks Kevin why he called. Kevin plays a song on the jukebox that made him think of Chiron. After Kevin serves Chiron dinner, the two of them go to his apartment. Kevin tells Chiron that he is happy despite the fact that his life didn't turn out as he had hoped, resulting in Chiron breaking down and admitting that he has not been intimate with anybody since their encounter years ago. As Kevin comforts him, Black remembers himself as Little, standing on a beach in the moonlight.

The theater piece was shelved for about a decade before it served as the basis for Moonlight. After the release of his debut feature film Medicine for Melancholy in 2008, Barry Jenkins wrote various screenplays, none of which entered production. In January 2013, producer Adele Romanski urged Jenkins to make a second film. The two brainstormed a few times a month through video-chat, with the goal of producing a low-budget \\"cinematic and personal\\" film. Jenkins was introduced to McCraney's play through the Borscht arts collective in Miami. After discussions with McCraney, Jenkins wrote the first draft of the film in a month-long visit to Brussels. Although the original play contained three parts, they ran simultaneously so that the audience would experience a day in the life of Little, Chiron and Black concurrently. In fact, it is not made clear that the characters are the same person until halfway through the play. Jenkins instead chose to split the three parts of the original piece into distinct chapters and to focus on Chiron's story from the perspective of an ally. The result was a screenplay that reflected the similar upbringings of Jenkins and McCraney. The character Juan was based on the father of McCraney's brother, who was also a childhood \\"defender\\" of McCraney, as Juan was for Chiron. Likewise, Paula was a depiction of Jenkins' and McCraney's mothers, who both struggled with drug addictions. McCraney and Jenkins also both grew up in Miami's Liberty Square, a primary location of the film. Jenkins looked for financing for the film during 2013, finding success after sharing the script with the executives of Plan B Entertainment at the year's Telluride Film Festival. Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner of Plan B Entertainment became producers of the film, while A24 undertook to finance it and handle worldwide distribution, which marked the company's first production. = Casting = 284x284px Different actors portrayed Chiron and Kevin in each chapter of the film. Ashton Sanders was cast in the role of teen Chiron. Alex Hibbert and Jaden Piner were cast for the roles of child Chiron and child Kevin, respectively, in an open casting call in Miami. Trevante Rhodes originally auditioned for the role of Kevin, before he was cast as adult Chiron. Andr√© Holland had previously acted in McCraney's plays, and had read In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue a decade before the release of the film. Holland was attracted to the role of adult Kevin when later reading the script of the film, stating, \\"[The script] was the best thing I've ever read\\". Naomie Harris was initially reluctant to portray Paula, stating that she did not want to play a stereotypical depiction of a black woman. When addressing her concerns, Jenkins emphasized the character's representation of both his and McCraney's mothers. Harris later commented that although she had previously vowed not to portray a crack addict, the film's script and director's tolerance appealed to her. In preparation for her role, Harris watched interviews of those with addiction to crack cocaine, and met with addicted women. She related her experiences of bullying to the addicts' attempts of escaping trauma. Romanski proposed Juan be played by Mahershala Ali, who had a role in one of her previously produced films, Kicks. Jenkins was hesitant when casting Ali due to his role as Remy Danton in House of Cards; however, he was convinced after witnessing Ali's acting range and understanding of his character. Ali considered the role an important opportunity to portray an African-American male mentor, and drew on his experiences of \\"[growing] up with a Juan\\". Janelle Mon√°e was sent the script and immediately connected to her role as Teresa, commenting that she too had family members with similar struggles relating to drugs and sexual identity. = Filming = Part of the film was shot in the Liberty Square housing project Filming began on October 14, 2015, in Miami, Florida. After scouting for locations in Miami with Romanski, Jenkins made an effort to film in locations where he previously lived. Liberty Square, a housing project located in the neighborhood of Liberty City, was chosen as one of the primary locations as both McCraney and Jenkins grew up in the area. The film was shot undisturbed since Jenkins had relatives living in the area, though the cast and crew had police escorts. Naomie Harris later reflected: During filming, Jenkins made sure that the three actors for Chiron did not meet each other until after filming to avoid any imitations of one another. Consequently, Rhodes, Sanders, and Hibbert filmed in separate two-week periods. Mahershala Ali frequently flew to Miami on consecutive weekends to film during the production of other projects. Naomie Harris shot all of her scenes in three days without rehearsals, while Andr√© Holland filmed the totality of his scenes in five. The film was shot in a period of twenty-five days. Jenkins worked with cinematographer and longtime friend James Laxton, who previously shot Medicine for Melancholy. The two chose to avoid the \\"documentary look\\" and thus shot the film using widescreen CinemaScope on an Arri Alexa digital camera, which better rendered skin tone. With colorist Alex Bickel, they further achieved this by creating a color grade that increased the contrast and saturation while preserving the detail and color. As a result, the three chapters of the film were designed to imitate different film stocks. The first chapter emulated the Fuji film stock to intensify the cast's skin tones. The second chapter imitated the Agfa film stock, which added cyan to the images, while the third chapter used a modified Kodak film stock. = Editing = The film was edited in Los Angeles by Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders, former university schoolmates of Jenkins. Sanders was responsible for editing the first and second chapters. McMillon was responsible for the third act which included the \\"diner scene\\", a favorite of the cinematographer Laxton. Music The score of Moonlight was composed by Nicholas Britell. Britell applied the chopped and screwed technique from hip hop remixes to orchestral music, producing a \\"fluid, bass-heavy score\\". The soundtrack, released on October 21, 2016, consists of eighteen original cues by Britell along with others by Goodie Mob, Boris Gardiner, and Barbara Lewis. A chopped and screwed version was released by OG Ron C and DJ Candlestick of The Chopstars. = Track listing =  Themes  Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, lists \\"love, sex, survival, mothers and father figures\\" among its themes, particularly the lack of a nurturing father. However, A. O. Scott of The New York Times cites the character Juan as an example of how the film \\"evokes clich√©s of African- American masculinity in order to shatter them.\\" In his review in Variety, Peter Debruge suggests that the film demonstrates that the African American identity is more complex than has been portrayed in films of the past. For example, while Juan plays the role of Little's defender and protector, he is also part of the root cause of at least some of the hardship the young boy endures. A major theme of Moonlight is the black male identity and its interactions with sexual identity. The film takes a form similar to a triptych in order to explore the path of a man from a neglected childhood, through an angry adolescence, to self-realization and fulfillment in adulthood. This particular story of Chiron's sexuality is also seen as a story of race in a 'post-Obama' era. The film amalgamates art film with hood film in its portrayal of African-American characters on-screen. Many technical film techniques are employed to juxtapose the characters and action on scene, including the use of an orchestral score done in the melody of popular R&B; and hip-hop motifs. This specifically deals with the theme of recuperating identity, especially in terms of blackness. The characters operate in an urban working-class city in Florida but are portrayed through art house conventions to create a new space for black characters in cinema. This mirrors Chiron's own odyssey to learning who he is, as he constantly struggles with trying to find some essentialism to his identity, yet consistently fails in doing so. The triptych structure helps to reiterate the fragmented personality to the film and Chiron. = Black masculinity = The film's co-writer, Tarell Alvin McCraney, speaks on the topic of black masculinity in the film, explaining why Chiron went to such lengths to alter his persona. He argues that communities without privilege or power seek to gain it in other ways. He says one way in which males in such communities do this is by trying to enhance their masculine identity, knowing that it often provides a means to more social control in a patriarchal society. In Moonlight, masculinity is portrayed as rigid and aggressive, amongst the behavior of young Black males in Chiron's teenage peer group. The expression of hyper-masculinity among Black men has been associated with peer acceptance and community. Being a homosexual within the Black community, on the other hand, has been associated with social alienation and homophobic judgement by peers because Black gay men are seen as weak or effeminate. In the film, Chiron is placed in this divide as a Black gay man and alters his presentation of masculinity as a strategy to avoid ridicule because homosexuality is viewed as incompatible with Black masculine expectations. As young kids, Kevin hides his sexuality in order to avoid being singled out like Chiron is. As Chiron grows older, he recognizes the need to conform to a heteronormative ideal of Black masculinity in order to avoid abuse and homophobia. As an adult, Chiron chooses to embrace the stereotypical Black male gender performance by becoming muscular and a drug-dealer. Moonlight explores the effects of this felt powerlessness in black males. As McCraney explains, coping with this feeling often coincides with attempts to overstate one's masculinity, in a way that can easily become toxic. He says one unfortunate side effect of leaning into masculinity too much is that men no longer want to be \\"caressed, or nurtured, or gentle,\\" which is why a character like Juan may be puzzling to some audiences. Chiron's choice to value masculinity over the desire to be loved or caressed becomes evident in scenes like his first sexual encounter with Kevin. These ideas are related to Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley's essay \\"Black Atlantic, Queer Atlantic,\\" in which she claims that the slave ships of the middle passage may have allowed for the formulation of queer identities and relationships amongst the black men and women below deck. She argues the formulation of queer relationships was a method of resistance, providing love and comfort to black people when there should have been none. However, Chiron does not view the desire to form a homosexual bond as being compatible with his desire to claim his masculinity, and this false dichotomy is the source of much internal tension and strife in his character throughout the film. = Intersection of blackness, masculinity, and vulnerability = Blackness, masculinity, and vulnerability are major focuses of this film. In the beach scene with Chiron, Juan, his father figure in the film, emphasizes the importance of black identity. Juan says, \\"There are black people everywhere. Remember that, okay? No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people. We was the first on this planet.\\" As Juan speaks about the relevance and importance of the black experience, he also thinks about a time in his youth when a stranger told him \\"in moonlight, black boys look blue.\\" This is an image that the audience gets to see as the director, Barry Jenkins, supplies numerous shots of Chiron in the moonlight. It seems that Juan seems to associate this image with vulnerability, given that he tells Chiron that he eventually shed the nickname \\"Blue\\" in order to foster his own identity. The scenes depicting Chiron in the moonlight are almost always the ones in which he's vulnerable, his intimate night on the beach with Kevin included. Throughout the film, this dichotomy between black and blue stands in for that between tough and vulnerable, with the black body often hovering between the two. In Chiron's situation, the black body, which can be seen as inherently vulnerable in American society, must be tough in order to survive, as seen by Chiron's final, very masculine and dominant identity. = Water = Water is often seen as cleansing and transformative and this is apparent in the film as well. Whether it be him swimming in the ocean or simply splashing water on his face, Chiron is constantly interacting with water. However, it is most notable that water is most often seen in the film in times of immense transition for Chiron. Throughout his life, Chiron resorts to water to bring him comfort e.g. taking baths when his mother is not home or swimming in the ocean with Juan. In the scene where Juan taught Little to swim, he explained to him the duality of water in relation to Black existence, a concept addressed in Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley's Black Atlantic, Queer Atlantic. The ocean is like a crosscurrent as Tinsley says, that can simultaneously be a place of inequality and exploitation as well as beauty and resistance. Tinsley describes how, \\"black queerness itself becomes a crosscurrent through which to view hybrid, resistant subjectivities and perhaps, black queers really have no ancestry except the black water.\\" The water, is either an environment that can destroy Chiron or allow him to triumph and throughout the movie we see Chiron using the water to cope and find himself. Release Jenkins, Holland, and Sanders in Toronto The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016, the New York Film Festival on October 2, 2016, the BFI London Film Festival on October 6, 2016 and the Vancouver International Film Festival on October 7, 2016. The film was released to select theaters on October 21, 2016, before beginning a wide release on November 18, 2016. The full UK cinema release was on February 17, 2017. = Marketing = The film's poster reflects its triptych structure, combining the three actors portraying Chiron into a single face. The trailer for the film was released on August 11, 2016 in time for festival season. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times referred to it \\"as one of the most anticipated films for fall\\". On February 27, 2017, the day after the Academy Awards, Calvin Klein released an underwear advertising campaign featuring four of the male actors in the film. On March 7, 2017, Beijing-based streaming video service iQiyi announced that it has acquired the rights to stream the film in China. The film is also available in home media format through iTunes and DVD. Reception =Box office= Moonlight grossed $27.9 million in the United States and Canada and $37.5 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $65.3 million, against a production budget of $4 million. The film originally played in four theaters in its limited October 21, 2016 release, grossing $402,072 (a per-theater average $100,519). The film's theater count peaked at 650 in its wide opening on November 18, 2016, before expanding to 1,014 theaters in February. After the Oscars ceremony, A24 announced that the film would be played at 1,564 theaters. In the weekend following its Oscar wins the film grossed $2.5 million, up 260% from its previous week and marking the highest-grossing weekend of its entire theatrical release. It was also a higher gross than the previous two Best Picture winners, Spotlight ($1.8 million) and Birdman ($1.9 million), had in their first weekend following the Academy Awards. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 384 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Moonlight uses one man's story to offer a remarkable and brilliantly crafted look at lives too rarely seen in cinema.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 99 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". On both websites, it was the highest-scoring film released in 2016. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a positive review after Moonlight premiered at the 2016 Telluride Film Festival. He praised the actors' performances and described the cinematography of James Laxton as \\"fluid and seductive, deceptively mellow, and shot through with searing compassion\\". Rooney concluded that the film \\"will strike plangent chords for anyone who has ever struggled with identity, or to find connections in a lonely world\\". In a uniformly positive review for Time Out New York, Joshua Rothkopf gave Moonlight five stars out of five and praised Barry Jenkins's direction. Brian Formo of Collider gave Moonlight an 'A‚àí' grade rating, applauding the performances and direction but contending that the film \\"is more personal and important than it is great\\". Similarly, Jake Cole of Slant Magazine praised the acting, but criticized the screenplay, and argued that \\"so much of the film feels old-hat\\". In a review for The Verge, Tasha Robinson lamented the plot details omitted between the film's three acts, but wrote that \\"what does make it to the screen is unforgettable\\". While discussing the film after its screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described Moonlight as \\"achingly romantic and uncommonly wise\\", and an early Oscar contender. Chang further wrote: \\"[Barry Jenkins] made a film that urges the viewer to look past Chiron's outward appearance and his superficial signifiers of identity, climbing inside familiar stereotypes in order to quietly dismantle them from within ... [Moonlight] doesn't say much. It says everything\\". Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood characterized the film as a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy: Camilla Long of The Times wrote that the film's \\"story has been told countless times, against countless backdrops\\", and that the film is not \\"relevant\\" to a predominantly \\"straight, white, middle class\\" audience. Long was criticized by users on Twitter for the review, and was accused of being homophobic and racist in her writing. Catherine Shoard, however, pointed out that \\"critics' opinions are subjective, and are supposed to be,\\" but also noted her dismay for Long's \\"struggle to feel for those who aren't like you.\\" Moreover, David McAlmont referred to Long's review as \\"not a review ...

Moonlight received four nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards: Best Film, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Original Screenplay. Moonlight received eight nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, the second highest of all nominees, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (for Ali), Best Supporting Actress (for Harris) and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film won three awards: for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. At the ceremony, presenter Faye Dunaway read La La Land as the winner of Best Picture. Co- presenter Warren Beatty later stated that he had mistakenly been given the duplicate Best Actress envelope, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land several minutes prior. When the mistake was realized, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz came forward to announce Moonlight as the correct winner. During his keynote presentation at the 2018 SXSW Festival, Barry Jenkins read the speech he had prepared in the event Moonlight won Best Picture at the Oscars. Because of the confusion over La La Land having been incorrectly announced, Jenkins was unable to read the intended speech at the Academy Awards. Because the film's screenplay was based on a play that had not previously been produced or published, different awards have had different rules about whether it qualified in the original or adapted screenplay categories.\\"Oscars: Moonlight ineligible for Best Original Screenplay\\". Entertainment Weekly, December 15, 2016. It was classified as an original screenplay by both the Writers Guild of America Awards and the BAFTAs, but was ruled as an adapted screenplay according to Academy Award rules. Nat Sanders and Joi McMillon were nominated for Best Film Editing, making McMillon the first black woman to earn an Academy Award nomination in film editing.

She served in World War I and received the Royal Red Cross for bravery during the evacuation of a field hospital that was under enemy bombardment on the Western Front.  Early life  Abell was born on 13 June 1872 in Newcastle, New South Wales. She was the daughter of Elijah Abell and Margaret (n√©e Brown) and grew up in the suburb of Wallsend with her family.  Nursing career  Abell was one of the founding members of the Australasian Trained Nurses Association and later had a desire to serve in the war as a nurse. Lydia trained and graduated at Newcastle Hospital in 1898 and hence worked there. Before the war, she worked as a private nurse for Thomas Cook of Turanville, a famous cattle breeder. She then travelled to England to join the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserved (QAIMNSR). For many years Abell continued her practice in Sydney, and was attached to the Phillip Street Nurses Home. = Service in World War I = Abell made her own way to Europe, embarking on 18 September 1915 and arriving in Tilbury on 1 November 1915. She volunteered her services to the military authorities and was assigned to Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve. She was designated to a military hospital at Talence, in the southwest of France near Bordeaux, then was transferred to the 32nd Stationary Hospital in the north of France at Boulogne. She was then appointed for hospital work on one of the canals and was frequently under fire, and as a result she was moved to the 14th General Stationary Hospital at Boulogne, and was moved again to serve duty at a casualty clearing station in the danger zone. Despite her harrowing experiences of war, Abell was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 July 1918 as saying, \\"Much as I would like to come home, I do not wish to leave the boys or my work.‚Äù She was discharged in April 1919, and returned to Australia on 25 September 1919. = Recognition = During her time spent on the casualty clearing stations her group had a hasty removal of the hospital which was immediately behind the lines on the Western Front, owing to the allied army being pressed back by the Germans. Less than half an hour's warning was given to the staff to pack up as much of the equipment as possible and leave with the wounded patients. Hospitals in the vicinity were being deliberately bombed by German aircraft and she successfully re- established the station in a safer quarter. These were the actions that won her the Royal Red Cross medal. She received her Royal Red Cross (RRC) on 15 May 1919 by George V at the Buckingham Palace. The RRC is awarded for exceptional service in military nursing.  Later life  Abell never married, and died on 21 July 1959 at the Lady Gowrie Home in Gordon New South Wales, aged 87 years. Lydia Abell is listed on the Wallsend War Memorial and was listed with the British Military Nursing Unit while others were listed with the Australian Army Nursing Service.

The film looks at police corruption in the 75th precinct of the New York Police Department during the 1980s. The documentary focuses on Michael Dowd, a former police officer of 10 years, who was arrested in 1992, leading to one of the largest police corruption scandals in New York City history. The documentary uses footage from the Mollen Commission investigation in 1992 and also provides in-depth commentary from Dowd, Ken Eurell, and Adam Diaz, among others. The documentary premiered at DOC NYC November 14, 2014. In 2015, Sony Pictures purchased the rights of The Seven Five documentary in an auction. __TOC__  Plot  The 75th Precinct today, located on Sutter Ave., East New York, Brooklyn. In the 1980s, Brooklyn, New York was suffering from a crack epidemic. Michael Dowd worked in the NYPD's 75th Precinct in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn, which was considered to be one of the most dangerous precincts in the United States at the time. The 75th Precinct had one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s. Dowd describes being under-appreciated for the amount of work he put in and hurting for money as the reasons for taking money from drug dealers. He initially began taking bribes from drug dealers on the streets before moving on to protecting a drug cartel leader and robbing other drug dealers at gunpoint. Dowd and his then-partner Henry \\"Chicky\\" Guevara recount the first time walking into a domestic dispute in an apartment and seeing bags of marijuana, a duffle bag filled with approximately $20,000 in cash and two guns. Dowd communicated that he and his partner would take $8000 from the duffle bag and both guns. Dowd continued to rob drug dealers for thousands of dollars. Guevara resigned shortly after multiple police officers were arrested in the 77th Precinct for corruption related offenses. Ken Eurell, a police officer at the 75th Precinct, was then assigned as Dowd's new partner in June 1987. Eurell had a drinking problem and frequently drank on the job. Dowd and Eurell met a Dominican gang leader named Adam Diaz. Diaz ran The Diaz Organization, a gang that was responsible for countless murders and drug trafficking throughout New York City. He used several supermarkets in East New York as fronts to traffic drugs, mainly cocaine. Dowd and Eurell began a working relationship with Diaz, where they provided protection and inside information about raids. After a prolonged investigation, the Suffolk County Police Department arrested Dowd and Eurell on drug trafficking charges (in addition to their work for Diaz in the city, the men had begun distributing cocaine through a friend who lived in the county). Dowd and Eurell were released on bail. While out on bail, Dowd was approached by a friend in a Colombian gang who wanted a woman kidnapped over an unpaid drug debt. Dowd's plan was to hand the woman over to the gang and for him and Eurell to take the hundreds of thousands of dollars at the woman's house and flee the United States. Eurell agreed to Dowd's kidnapping scheme but instead of following through with the scheme contacted Internal Affairs through his lawyer. Shortly after, in July 1991, Dowd was arrested and sent to trial. He was the main focus of the 1992 Mollen Commission that investigated police corruption in the NYPD. In the wake of Dowd's arrest, Mayor David Dinkins appointed the Mollen Commission to investigate police corruption within the NYPD. As a result, dozens of officers across the city's precincts were arrested.  Convictions  Dowd was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy to distribute narcotics and was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 1994, serving 13 years. Prior to trial, Dowd agreed to testify before the Commission but he refused to implicate any NYPD officers other than himself. Eurell did not serve any time due to his cooperation with the investigation. Adam Diaz, after serving eight years in prison, was deported to the Dominican Republic.  Reception  The film was well received and has an 100% Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 22 out of 26 reviews being positive.

The only known species is the type Morrosaurus antarcticus.  Discovery  In 2002 the Argentine paleontologist Fernando Novas reported the discovery of a partial skeleton of a euornithopod in Antarctica.Novas, F.E., A.V. Cambiaso, J. Lirio, & H. N√∫√±ez, 2002, \\"Paleobiogeograf√≠a de los dinosaurios cret√°cicos polares de Gondwana\\", Ameghiniana (Res√∫menes) 39(4): 15R In 2016 these remains were the basis for naming the type species Morrosaurus antarcticus, named and described by Sebastian Rozadilla, Federico Lisandro Agnolin, Fernando Emilio Novas, Alexis Rolando Aranciaga Mauro, Matthew J. Motta, Juan Manuel Lirio Marcelo, and Pablo Isasi. The genus name refers to the site of El Morro on James Ross Island, where the remains of the species were found. The specific name refers to Antarctica. The holotype specimen MACN Pv 197, was found in a layer of the Snow Hill Island Formation (Cape Lambe, previously assigned to the Lopez de Bertodano Formation), dating to the Maastrichtian age. The remains consists in a right hind leg, including the top of the femur, the lower end of the femur, the upper part of the tibia, the underside of the tibia, the upper half of the foot, the bottom of the midfoot and the top of the first joint of the third toe.  Description  The type specimen corresponds to a medium-sized animal. The descriptors were able to establish some distinctive features. Two of these are autapomorphies, i.e. derived features that are unique. In bottom view, the greater trochanter of the femur has an undulating profile with a thick edge output and a main thin edge. The fourth metatarsal bone has a triangular profile with a rearward projection that wraps around it and the third metatarsal. In addition, there is a unique combination of two features that by themselves are not unique features. In the femur, the lesser trochanter is inclined diagonally, right next to the greater trochanter. In the tibia, medial malleolus has a triangular outline view showing a front concave surface.  Phylogeny  Morrosaurus was classified in the group Iguanodontia, as a basal member of Euiguanodontia. This in turn formed a clade with other ornithopods of Patagonia and Antarctica, particularly Trinisaura, Gasparinisaura, Anabisetia, Notohypsilophodon, Talenkauen and Macrogryphosaurus in a group called Elasmaria, whose members are distinguished by their adaptation to a running lifestyle which would be reflected by the narrow foot with a thin fourth metatarsal which indicates a high speed running; subsequently expanded chevrons, a feature that is associated with a greater surface area for attachment of the lateral muscles of the tail, which would give good control of the movements of this; and a curved humerus which demonstrates the absence of a deltopectoral ridge and therefore that the front leg was not used for walking. It cannot be determined, however, if Morrosaurus itself possessed these characteristics due to their limited remains. The existence of this clade may indicate that Patagonia, Antarctica and Australia shared the same type of fauna. The exact phylogenetic relationships within this clade could not be identified, except for Gasparinisaura, which proved to be the most basal member of group.

In 1963 he became the first non-caucasian elected to the San Diego City Council. He served in the California State Assembly from 1968 to 1970./ Hom represented the 79th Assembly District; he was the second Asian American elected to the California State Legislature. Background and early life Hom's father came to the United States, when he was only 15 years old with little cash aboard the Manchuria in 1909, changing his name to David due to influence from Presbyterian missionaries in China. In all he fathered 12 children. Hom's father named him after Thomas Edison; he also named his other children after notable Americans, such as Francis Scott Key and Paul Revere. Hom's mother died when Tom was four years old and his father died when Tom was 12. Prior to entering kindergarten, Hom was unable to speak English. Beginning at the age of 15, he began to work at the family business, David Produce Company, and then graduated from San Diego High School. During World War II, Hom worked on a farm which his family had taken over from a Japanese American family; the farm was located on the present site of SDCCU Stadium. In 1947, he moved to North Park with his stepmother, overcoming racial covenants which would have barred them. Before becoming a politician Hom held multiple jobs, including work in food service, agriculture, and broadcasting. Taking classes at night, Hom went on to earn a degree in business administration from the University of California, San Diego. Political career At the age of 36, Hom was elected to the San Diego City Council; by 1962, he was the deputy mayor of San Diego. When Hom was re-elected in 1967, he won with 87% of the vote, this has been largest plurality of the vote in any election in San Diego. While a politician, Hom was involved in getting San Diego Stadium built, and the gentrification of the Gaslamp Quarter. In 1968, with the encouragement of Ronald Reagan, Hom ran for a seat in the California State Assembly, and won. Until Chris Cate was elected in 2014, Hom had been the only Asian American to have been elected to the San Diego City Council. Post-political career Founding a real estate company, named after himself, Hom played a major role in developing Downtown San Diego; this began in 1973, when Hom and his brother purchased the building that had housed the Security Pacific National Bank, which was first built in 1884. In the late 1990s his company went on to expand into projects in the Las Vegas area; this included low cost housing, with the construction of Campaige Place in 2000. Personal life At one point family members owned the Western Metal Supply Company (which was integrated into Petco Park when it was constructed), and Hom was the first president of the Gaslamp Quarter Association. Remaining involved in public policy Hom made an effort to save buildings important to the history of Chinese Americans in San Diego, criticizing reports on historical significance that lacked input from the Chinese American community. After 48 years of marriage, Hom's wife Dorothy, died of cancer in 1999; In 2013, she was posthumously entered into the Hall of Fame of the Women's Museum of California. He married again, to Loretta, with whom he practices Tai Chi. In 2014, Hom's autobiography was published; That same year the Rotary Club of San Diego presented to Hom the \\"Mr. San Diego\\" award, and San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer declared the day when he received the award to be Tom Hom Day. , Hom resides in Southeast Chula Vista. In 2017, his art work was displayed at the San Diego Chinese Historical Museum.

Early life and education  Barsky was born in the Bronx in New York City. He moved to Long Island and then New Jersey. In 1973, he returned to New York City, this time living in Long Island. He went to the Walden School for high school. He is Jewish and attributes his support for social justice to his Jewish schooling and upbringing. Barsky pursued his undergraduate studies at Oberlin College and a graduate degree in journalism at Columbia Journalism School.  Career  = Hedge fund manager = Barsky started work as an analyst for Morgan Stanley in 1993, working on commercial real estate and the gaming industry. Within a year, he got listed in the All-Star Analysts list of Institutional Investor. In 1998, Barsky and fellow Morgan Stanley alumnus Scott M. Sipprelle started a hedge fund called Midtown Research. Barsky stayed with the fund until 2002. In November 2007, a few months before the global stock market collapse, Sipprelle closed down the fund. Sipprelle would subsequently become a venture capitalist and would also be the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives in 2010. In 2002, Barsky left Midtown Research and opened his own hedge fund, Alson Capital Partners, named after his children, Alexandra and Davidson. The fund made successful investments in Sears Holdings and shorted newspaper and furniture companies. It also exited the housing sector in early 2006 before the bursting of the housing bubble, although Barsky incorrectly believed that there was no bubble. After correctly predicting the popularity of the Atkins diet, the fund shorted Panera Bread and Krispy Kreme. At its peak, the fund would have $3.5 billion in assets under management. In 2008, as a result of the global financial crisis, Alson lost 24% of its assets, down to $1.5 billion, primarily due to its large holdings in energy and utility stocks, all of which fell more than 50% after producing big gains in previous years. At the end of May 2009, the fund shut down, returning $800 million to investors. Alson's former chief operating officer said that Barsky made sure that all employees had equity and got generous severance packages, so that the closure did not cause any of their lives to be ruined. Over his entire career as an investor (August 1998 to March 2009) Barsky made an average 12.1% a year. New York Times journalist Joe Nocera said that during his years as a hedge fund manager, Barsky was an important source of information about the workings of finance to Nocera, but was generally referenced anonymously because hedge fund managers feared that visibility would make investors think they weren't doing their job. = Journalist = Barsky's interest in journalism was sparked by a high school project on the effect of busing legislation on communities in Boston. He failed to get a journalism job right out of college and therefore went to the Columbia Journalism School. In 1986, he started work in the news business, working the business desk at the New York Daily News. In 1988, he moved to the Wall Street Journal, where he covered commercial real estate and the gambling industry. He left the Journal in 1993 for a career in finance, where he would stay until 2009. Despite being successful in finance, Barsky continued to identify as a journalist. In 2009, after shutting down his hedge fund, Barsky renewed his exploration of journalism. Barsky has been skeptical of journalism's almost-exclusive reliance on advertising for revenue, a skepticism that also informed his decision to short newspaper companies while operating his hedge fund. As chairman of the board of overseers of the Columbia Journalism Review, he encouraged the organization to play an important role in coming up with new business models. He similarly pushed the nonprofit Youth Communications to think about what projects would financially sustain the organization. Barsky's interest in new models for journalism would eventually lead him to co-found The Marshall Project along with former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller. First announced in November 2013 by Barsky, the project got Keller on board in February 2014. = Journalistic coverage of Donald Trump = Barsky has reported extensively on the business career of current President Donald Trump since 1985, mainly for The Wall Street Journal and The Daily News. He has interviewed Trump dozens of times over the course of his journalistic coverage. In 1991, Barsky won the Gerald Loeb Award for Deadline and/or Beat Writing for his \\"Coverage of the Collapse of Donald Trump's Financial Empire\\" while at The Wall Street Journal. In August 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, Barsky wrote a piece for The New York Times about his experience covering Trump as a businessman. He recounted when Trump was \\"on the brink of financial ruin\\" and noted that he was a \\"walking disaster as a businessman for much of his life,\\" but also stated that he was \\"a skilled negotiator with an almost supernatural ability to pinpoint and attack his adversaries‚Äô vulnerabilities, as several of his Republican primary opponents discovered.\\" Trump threatened to sue Barsky multiple times over the course of his journalistic coverage, though he never followed through. Trump wrote of Barsky in his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, \\"Of all the writers who have written about me, probably none has been more vicious than Neil Barsky of the Wall Street Journal.\\" = Journalistic coverage of Rikers Island = Following numerous revelations about stark conditions in the New York City jail complex, Barsky wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times titled \\"Shut Down Rikers Island\\" (July 19, 2015). In the piece, Barsky argued that > \\"the only way to transform Rikers is to destroy it; it needs to be > permanently closed. The buildings are crumbling. The guard culture of > prisoner abuse and the gang culture of violence are ingrained. The complex > is New York‚Äôs Guant√°namo Bay: a secluded island, beyond the gaze of > watchdogs, where the Constitution is no guide. It is a place that has > outlived its usefulness.\\" In this piece, Barsky later made the case that \\"the closing of the country‚Äôs most notorious jail would serve as a powerful message\\" for national criminal justice reform. In March 2017, de Blasio announced his support for plans to close the Rikers Island complex through reducing the number of inmates from 10,000 to 5,000 and establishing a system of smaller jails in all five boroughs. These plans were released by an independent commission studying Rikers Island, created by City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. Previously, in February 2016, de Blasio had called the idea of shutting down Rikers Island a \\"noble concept,\\" but described it as unrealistic due to the cost. = Filmmaker = Barsky was inspired to work on documentaries after observing the success of Waiting for Superman and Gasland in sparking discussion about their respective underlying issues (charter schools and fracking). He produced and directed Koch, a documentary released in 2012 (and theatrically released February 2013) about the role that former New York City Mayor Ed Koch played in transforming the city in the 1980s. Barsky was co- executive producer and director of the documentary Knuckleball!, the short documentary Witnesses NYC, and the Koch episode in the TV series documentary POV.  The Marshall Project  The Marshall Project is a nonprofit journalistic organization started by Barsky that aims to cover issues related to criminal justice in the United States. In his byline for an op-ed for the New York Times in November 2013, Neil Barsky mentioned that he was working on The Marshall Project, with a one-sentence description and a link to a preliminary website. In February 2014, former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller announced that he was joining the project to lead the editorial team. The project had two of its investigative journalism pieces published in Slate and the Washington Post respectively, and it launched in November 2014 with funding from Barsky and many other sources, including the Ford Foundation.

The temple dates to the year 732, making it the first structure attributed to the ancient Mataram kingdom, which ruled Central Java from 732 to around the middle of the tenth century. Location Because of its relatively remote location, the temple site rarely appears on the itineraries of foreign tourists. But it possesses some historical importance owed to its links with the formation of the Central Javanese Mataram kingdom. The temple is located on Wukir hill, which the locals refer to as Gunung Wukir (\\"Mount Wukir\\", or \\"carved hill\\" in Javanese), on the western slopes of Mount Merapi volcano. The hill is located approximately 4 kilometres southeast from the town of Muntilan. Gunung Wukir temple can be reached by following the direction to the Ngluwar subdistrict by turning west from the Semen intersection, on Yogyakarta-Magelang main road. The Kadiluwih hamlet in Canggal, is connected to the Ngluwar road by a small walking trail that leads up to the hill plateau, approximately 300 meters above sea level. History Nandi bull, the vehicle of Shiva inside central perwara temple This temple is the oldest surviving temple in Southern Central Java, connected to the Canggal inscription discovered within the temple ruins in 1879. The inscription describes the erection of a lingam (the symbol of Shiva) on the country of Kunjarakunja, by Sanjaya's order. The lingam is sited on the noble island of Yava (Java), which the inscription describes as \\"rich in grain and gold mines\\". According to the inscription, the temple was founded during the reign of King Sanjaya from the Mataram Kingdom, in 654 Saka (732 CE). This inscription contains a lot of information related to Medang Kingdom or Hindu Mataram. Based on this inscription, Gunung Wukir temple might originally called Shivalinga or Kunjarakunja. Architecture One of the three perwara (complementary) temples in front of main temple of Gunung Wukir The temple compound measures 50 metres x 50 metres. The temple building is made of andesite stone, and at least consist of a main temple and three perwara temples (guardian or complementary smaller temple) lined in front of the main temple. In addition to the inscription, within the temple complex were also found archaeological artifacts including yoni pedestal and the statue of the sacred cow Nandi the vehicle of Shiva. According to the inscription, the yoni once support a lingam, the symbol of the god Shiva, however it is now missing.

Hopkins' first team was assembled in 1881, and spent an entire year training and learning a version of the game. Their sport, which was closer to rugby, was played in Druid Hill Park. After the training, the team planned a two-game 1882 season. The squad had to play the season under the title of the Clifton Athletic Club, due to the school's policy on the sport of football. The first was a practice game with the Baltimore Athletic Club, played on October 7. The Hopkins team lost the contest 4‚Äì0. The following game was their first true game, to be played against the Naval Academy.Patterson (2000), p. 3Bealle, Morris Allison (1951).

Acting as both a player and a coach, Carter procured a single game for the Academy to play. The team challenged the Baltimore-based Clifton Athletic Club to a game during the Academy's Thanksgiving Day athletic carnival. The Clifton team was actually made up of players from Johns Hopkins, who were unable to play as their school due to the institution's harsh opinion on football.Kroll (2002), p. 14Patterson (2000), p. 21 Schedule Navy game It snowed heavily before the game, to the point where players for both teams had to clear layers of snow off of the field, making large piles of snow along the sides of the playing ground. The field was 110 yards by 53 yards, with goalposts apart and high. The first half of the game went scoreless; the Baltimore American reported that \\"the visitors pushed Navy every place but over the goal line in the first half\\".Bealle (1951), p. 9 During play, the ball was kicked over the seawall a number of times, once going so far out it had to be retrieved by boat before play could continue.Patterson (2000), p. 22 The American described the second half in detail: : After ten minutes interval the ball was again put in play, this time being kicked off by the Cliftons. The rest period had apparently stiffened the Cliftons, for the Academy making a vigorous spurt got the ball thru them, and Street, following it up well, scored a touchdown for the Academy. : The try at goal failed, but the ball, instead of going to the Cliftons behind the line, fell into the field and into the hands of one of the Academy team. By a quick decisive run, he again got the ball over the Cliftons goal line and scored a touchdown. Cadet George Washington Street was identified as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported black and light blue striped jerseys and caps, with white pants and blue socks. The Naval Academy wore maroon socks, caps, and belts, with white pants and jerseys. Both teams also nailed strips of leather to the bottom of their shoes to help deal with slipping.Bealle (1951), p. 10 See also *Johns Hopkins‚ÄìNavy football rivalry References Clifton Athletic Club Category:Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football seasons Category:College football winless seasons Clifton Athletic Club Football ","title":"1882 Clifton Athletic Club football team"},{"id":"48321506","text":"The New York State Financial Control Board was created in 1975 following a financial crisis and state bailout to oversee municipal spending.

Taxonomy Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries described it as Agaricus erubescens in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum. The species name is derived from the Latin erubescens, meaning \\"reddening\\" or \\"blushing\\". It became Hygrophorus erubescens with the raising of Hygrophorus to genus rank. Common names include blotched woodwax, and pink waxcap. The species is classified in the subsection Pudorini of genus Hygrophorus, along with the closely related species H. pudorinus and H. purpurascens. Description The fruit body (mushroom) is a fair size, with a diameter light pink to white cap that can be dotted with darker pink or red marks and bruises yellow. The colour is darker in the cap centre. Convex and flattening with age, the cap often has a boss and an inrolled margin when young. Its surface is slimy or sticky. The white gills are adnate to somewhat decurrent, becoming pale pink as they mature. The stipe is tall and wide. The spore print is white and the oval spores measure 6.5‚Äì11 x 4.5‚Äì6.5 micrometres. The mushroom has no strong odor or taste. The species is inedible. =Similar species= The similar-looking Hygrophorus russula can be distinguished by its more crowded gills and preference for hardwood forests, and H. purpurascens has a partial veil. Habitat and distribution Hygrophorus erubescens fruits from August to October in coniferous forests, particularly spruce (Picea), on chalky soils. The mushrooms are found singly or sometimes in large troops. The range in North America is from the Rocky Mountains to the West Coast and Tennessee north to the Great Lakes region and southern parts of Canada. The fungus is classified as extinct in the British Mycological Society's 2006 list of threatened fungi, as it has not been documented in Great Britain since 1878. It is found across Scandinavia, and has been recorded fruiting at high altitudes in alpine-subalpine regions of Russia, and mountainous parts of Central Europe. The species has been found in the East and Middle Black Sea regions of Turkey. In Japan, it is most common in coniferous woods, and has been recorded from Hokkaido and Honshu.

German naturalist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer described the species as Agaricus russula in 1774. The species name is derived from its reddish coloration, reminiscent of members of the genus Russula. French botanist Claude Casimir Gillet placed it in the genus Tricholoma in 1878, before American naturalist Calvin Henry Kauffman gave it its current name in 1918. Though Kauffman thought it resembled the former genus, he held that its waxy gills showed it to be placed to the genus Hygrophorus. The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, can be abundant some years, especially after rainfall, sometimes appearing in arcs or fairy rings. The cap is hemispherical before flattening out with age, though the cap margin remains inrolled. Reaching in diameter, it has a base colour of white or pink with streaks of pink, wine-red or purple. The cap surface is sticky when young. The firm flesh is pink or white and has no strong taste or smell. The crowded gills are decurrent. White when young, they become discoloured with pink and wine-red stains. The stipe is high and wide. The spore print is white, the smooth oval spores measuring 6‚Äì8 by 3‚Äì5 Œºm under the microscope. It can be distinguished from russulas by its non-brittle stipe. The edible but poor Hygrophorus purpurascens is similar but has a veil and grows under conifers. In eastern North America, it appears under oak from August to October. It is more common in the east of the continent than the west. It is regarded as a good edible.

Commonly nicknamed \\"Signorine\\" (Italian: 'young ladies'), a nickname shared with the similar Class 625, these locomotives were the first superheated steam locomotives in Italy. Design and construction When the FS were created in 1905, Chief Mechanical Engineer Giuseppe Zara undertook a process to design of a standard range of locomotives; one of these was the Class 630, a light express engine which, together with the other designs, shared the features of being compound locomotives. However, with the diffusion in Germany (then in close ties with Italy because of the Triple Alliance) of the Schmidt superheater, a decision to build there a batch of 24 non-compound and superheated version of the Class 630 (keeping all the other features, including the Italian bogie and the peculiar inside-cylinders/outside valve chests and valve gear) was taken. Results were highly successful, and subsequently almost all steam locomotives in Italy would be built with simple expansion and superheating. The first locomotives were built by the German firm Schwartzkopff (as Italian industry lacked experience with the superheating technology), with other Italian firms building the rest, for a total of 169; four more Class 640 were added in 1951 when the railway company for which they had been built for (Strade Ferrate di Biella) was incorporated in the FS. All the Class 640 were fitted with a unique three-axle tender with a water capacity of Operations Originally pulling the principal express trains on the Italian mainlines, after a few years the Class 640 locomotives were replaced in these services by the more powerful Class 680 and Class 685 2-6-2 locomotives; they were then assigned to pulling passenger trains on secondary lines with level ground. They enjoyed a very long career, surviving up to the end of regular Italian steam services in the 1970s. Modifications Between 1929 and 1931 15 Class 630 locomotives were rebuilt with superheater, simple expansion and Caprotti valve gear; their running numbers were retained with the addition of 300, making them form the 640.3XX subclass. Preservation Sixteen Class 640 locomotives survive into preservation; of these, two (the 143 and 091) are currently operational and available for heritage trains, while others are being restored.

Somerset Maugham, first published by William Heinemann in 1947.Maugham, W. Somerset (1874-1965) British Library, accessed 15 October 2015. It was the last collection of stories prepared by the writer. In his introduction, Maugham writes, \\"Some of theses stories were written long ago, but I have left them as they were, for I did not think I could make them more readable by bringing them up to date... one story was written during the war and others since its close. They have all been published in magazines.\\" The stories =\\"The Colonel's Lady\\"= Evie is the wife of George Peregrine, a country gentleman and retired colonel; she publishes a book of poetry, which unexpectedly becomes successful. Readers of the book, including the colonel, realize that the poems describe a passionate affair that ended long ago. This embarrasses the colonel; however his solicitor advises him to do nothing. (This was one of the stories by Maugham dramatized in the film Quartet.) =\\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\"= Norman Grange, an impoverished rubber planter in a remote setting in Borneo, reluctantly looks after anthropologist Skelton who is recovering from malaria. Grange's wife is a former actress from Britain whose theatre company went bankrupt in Malaya. She hates her husband and the location, but it is impossible to leave. While Skelton is there she tells him her background and about her unhappiness, but not about her love affair with a visiting rubber company manager, whom Grange murdered. =\\"Appearance and Reality\\"= In Paris, Monsieur Le Sueur, a Senator and businessman, attends a fashion show with his wife, and sees Lissette Larion, a model; he establishes her as his mistress, providing her with an apartment. Later when Le Sueur has become a Minister, he discovers Lissette has a boyfriend. He agrees to her marrying the boyfriend, since it is appropriate for a Minister's mistress to be a respectable married woman. =\\"The Mother\\"= In Macarena, Seville, a woman known as La Cachirra, having served a prison sentence for murder, comes to the neighbourhood; her fierce, unsociable temperament intrigues the neighbours. She loves her son Currito, who regularly visits, and is jealous of his interest in Rosalia, a local girl. When Rosalia tells her she and Currito intend to get married, La Cachirra stabs her. =\\"Sanatorium\\"= Ashenden, staying for a while at a sanatorium in the north of Scotland, which treats patients with tuberculosis, encounters other patients: Campbell and McLeod, who have been there for years, enjoy hating each other; when McLeod dies, Campbell becomes depressed. As a consequence of McLeod's death, Major Templeton decides to make the most of his remaining months of life by marrying Ivy Bishop, who has a little longer to live. (This was one of the stories by Maugham dramatized in the film Trio.) =\\"A Woman of Fifty\\"= In a university in America, the narrator meets Laura Greene, the wife of an academic; remembering that he saw her years earlier in Italy, he recollects her history: She married Tito, son of an impoverished count who lived in a crumbling villa near Florence. Tito, suspecting an affair between Laura and his father, killed him. So that Tito would not be found guilty of premeditated murder, which would mean solitary confinement for life, Laura declared at his trial that his father had been her lover. =\\"The Romantic Young Lady\\"= In Seville, the Duchess de Dos Palos reluctantly sees the Countess de Marbella, the cleverest woman in Seville, to try and prevent her daughter marrying the Countess's coachman. The Countess subsequently sees her coachman, telling him he must choose between his job or marriage. The coachman decides to remain as the Countess's coachman, saying, \\"a place like this is found only once in a lifetime.\\" =\\"A Casual Affair\\"= Jack Almond, an opium addict found dead in a town in Malaya, leaves a parcel of letters to be returned to Lady Kastellan in London. They relate to their love affair, when he worked in the Foreign Office. Lord Kastellan brought the affair to an end, and Almond got a job with a shipping company in the far east. He remained in good spirits until, when meeting Lady Kastellan a few years later, he realized that the affair had meant little to her. =\\"The Point of Honour\\"= In Seville, the narrator meets an aristocrat who, finding that he has been reading the play El m√©dico de su honra by Calder√≥n, tells him a similar story: Don Pedro Aguria, an aristocrat, marries Soledad, whom he loves, although she does not love him. Pepe Alvarez, who was once engaged to Soledad, arrives from overseas; their relationship has ended, but Don Pedro is obliged to kill Alvarez if Soledad ever meets him again. Circumstances suggest, wrongly, that they do meet, and Don Pedro kills Alvarez in a duel. The narrator wonders if the unhappy-looking wife of the storyteller is Soledad. =\\"Winter Cruise\\"= The Friedrich Weber, a German freighter which carries a few passengers as well as freight, is in the Caribbean, and Miss Reid, an English teashop owner, is the only passenger. The crew find her an intolerable bore, and, deciding that she needs a lover, they choose the radio-operator: he delivers a message to her saying he loves her. Miss Reid is thoughtful and quiet for the rest of the cruise. (This was one of the stories by Maugham dramatized in the film Encore.) =\\"The Happy Couple\\"= At Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat (Maugham's home in later years), the narrator attends a dinner party given by a neighbour, who has invited Mr and Mrs Craig, a couple who live next door to her. The narrator brings his acquaintance Sir Edward Landon, an English judge. The Craigs are terrified of Landon, and leave the area the next day. He later tells the narrator that the Craigs appeared before him years ago accused of murder; he was sure they were guilty and expected to sentence them to hang, but the jury found them not guilty. =\\"A Man from Glasgow\\"= In Algeciras, a port in Spain, the narrator meets a man from Glasgow, in the olive trade, who is anxious to leave the country. He relates his experience at an olive estate in √âcija, where he repeatedly heard ghostly laughter from a nearby house. A madman died there years before and no one had lived there since then. He continued to hear the laughter when he moved to Seville, sixty miles away. =\\"The Unconquered\\"= In occupied France during the Second World War, two German soldiers stationed at Soissons ask the way at a nearby farm; they get drunk on the farmer's wine and one of them, Hans, rapes Annette, his daughter. Hans afterwards visits the farm whenever he can and, bringing much-needed food, gets on friendly terms with the farmer and his wife. Annette, who becomes pregnant, is defiantly opposed to Hans. =\\"Episode\\"= In Brixton in London, postman Fred Manson and Gracie Carter, daughter of a draper, fall passionately in love. When it is found that the money he spends on her was stolen from letters, he goes to prison. They intend to get married after the eighteen-month sentence, despite the opposition of Gracie's father, and they continue to think passionately about each other. Near the end of the prison sentence, Fred becomes uninterested in Gracie, and she kills herself. =\\"The Kite\\"= Herbert Sunbury, a young man living in a London suburb with his parents, likes to fly a kite on a Saturday afternoon. He marries Betty and they live in rented rooms. She disapproves of his kite-flying and tells him to go; he moves back to his parents, but continues to pay for her support. When she smashes his kite, which is a new, expensive model, he refuses to continue the regular payments, and so is sent to prison.

In 1843, Queen Rajya Lakshmi was made the queen regent. An ambitious woman, Queen Rajya Lakshmi wanted to have her son, Prince Ranendra, to be crowned the next king instead of her stepson, Surendra. She was somewhat responsible for the Kot massacre in 1846, which initiated the 104-year rule of the Rana dynasty in Nepal. Early life and background Rajya Lakshmi Devi was born around 1814. She was from Gorakpur, India. Queen of Nepal She was married to King Rajendra on February 5, 1824. They had two sons, Ranendra and Birendra. Queen Rajya Lakshmi was ambitious for power. Her husband was usually described as an incapable ruler, and his senior wife, Queen Samrajya, was the de facto regent from 1839 to 1841. After her death in 1841, Queen Rajya Lakshmi was the de facto regent, and in 1843, she was officially made the Queen regent. Rajya Lakshmi wanted her own son, Prince Ranendra, to become the next king. Jung Bahadur Kunwar- himself a very ambitious person- might have promised to help her but in doing this, he had his own motives. Kot massacre Gagan Singh Bhandari, a favorite of Queen Rajya Lakshmi and whom the queen had hoped to use to elevate her son as the king, was found dead. The queen gave orders for the entire administrative establishment of the country to be brought immediately at the courtyard of the palace armoury. Then the queen ordered for whom she suspected to have been the murderer of Gagan Singh to be executed. After a chaotic situation broke out, Jung Bahadur used the situation for his own advantage and eliminated many nobles. Aftermath of the Kot massacre Following the Kot massacre, Jung Bahadur Kunwar declared himself the prime minister. Queen Rajya Lakshmi- who had always trusted Jung- was begun to be shown disrespect and even the king was insulted. Enraged and insecure, the queen plotted to have Jung killed, but the plot was soon revealed. Jung Bahadur thought that the queen might be a threat to him. He accused the queen of actually plotting to kill the then Crown Prince Surendra and his younger brother, Prince Upendra so that her own son, Prince Ranendra, could become the next king. Jung had royal pandits read out the accusation. Ultimately, the queen and her two sons were exiled to India. King Rajendra accompanied them, and later tried to overthrow Jung Bahadur, but the king was defeated, kept under house arrest, and Prince Surendra was made the new king in 1847. The former king Rajendra continued to live in house arrest until his death in 1881. Life in exile Rajya Lakshmi continued to live in Varanasi. Jung Bahadur Rana visited Europe in 1850, and on his way back he visited Varanasi, where Rajya Lakshmi, along with her two sons, met him with submission.Himalaya Death Rajya Lakshmi must have died sometime before 1900.

Along with the UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest, it serves as a flagship hospital of UC San Diego Health and the primary teaching hospital for the UC San Diego School of Medicine. The facility, which offers specialized care not previously available in San Diego County, opened on November 20, 2016. Jacobs Medical Center comprises three specialty pavilions. The A. Vassiliadis Family Pavilion for Advanced Surgery occupies floors two and three. Floors four through six are reserved for the Pauline and Stanley Foster Pavilion for Cancer Care, and the eighth through tenth floors are occupied by the Rady Pavilion for Women and Infants. Jacobs Medical Center and the existing Thornton Pavilion share a first, second and third floor and are connected to Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center, the Perlman Medical Offices, and the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute building via footbridges.  Planning and construction  In 2005, the University of California San Diego announced plans to shift all its operations at its aging Hillcrest hospital to a new facility in La Jolla, adjacent to Thornton Hospital on the eastern half of its main campus. This announcement was met with heavy pushback from lawmakers, rival medical providers, and patient advocates who argued that the move would leave South Bay communities underserved and other local hospitals overwhelmed. On May 18, 2007, the UC Regents approved a plan to build an additional 125- to 150-bed inpatient tower in La Jolla. The approval was paired with a UC San Diego commitment to continue providing care in Hillcrest beyond the year 2030. The university broke ground on the new inpatient tower on April 9, 2012. At the time, the hospital was expected to cost $664 million and had been named the Jacobs Medical Center in honor of Irwin and Joan Jacobs donating $75 million toward its construction (they would go on to donate another $25 million). Over the next few years, construction costs continued to grow as health system officials decided to add a specialized surgical suite, operating rooms, an anatomic pathology lab, a cardiac rehabilitation program, a discharge pharmacy, and nursing administrative space. Additionally, it was determined that multiple floors which were originally planned as empty space would open with the rest of the hospital. The finished 509,500 sq ft, 245-bed tower cost more than $940 million and opened in November 2016. CannonDesign was the architect.https://www.cannondesign.com/our-work/work/uc-san-diego-jacobs- medical-center/  Pavilions  = Thornton Pavilion = Thornton Pavilion atrium Thornton Hospital opened in 1993 as a standalone general medical- surgical hospital with 119 beds and a full range of specialties. The construction of Jacobs Medical Center was originally intended as a simple expansion of the hospital, but evolved into the ten-story quaternary care facility that exists today. In 2016, the hospital was consolidated into the Jacobs Medical Center complex as its own pavilion. It shares a first, second and third floor with the new inpatient tower and a first and second floor with the Perlman Medical Offices outpatient clinic, and continues to offer services such as surgery and radiology. = Vassiliadis Pavilion = Entrance to the Vassiliadis Pavilion The A. Vassiliadis Pavilion for Advanced Surgery has 14 operating rooms of 650 sq ft each. It occupies the second and third floors of the medical center and is named for Carol Vassiliadis' $8.5 million gift on behalf of her deceased husband Alkiviadis. The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI- guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms. = Foster Pavilion = The Pauline and Stanley Foster Pavilion for Cancer Care is a 108-bed facility affiliated with Moores Cancer Center and dedicated to the treatment of advanced cancers. It is the only dedicated inpatient cancer hospital in San Diego. The pavilion occupies the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of Jacobs Medical Center and is named for a $7.5 million gift from Pauline Foster. Patients will have access to over 100 cancer subspecialists working at Moores Cancer Center. The sixth floor of the hospital, jointly operated with Sharp HealthCare, is the only open floor in California with full-unit air filtration, allowing blood and marrow transplant patients and those undergoing chemotherapy to socialize and roam throughout the floor. Procedures such as laser ablation of brain tumors are handled downstairs in the Vassiliadis Pavilion. = Rady Pavilion = The Rady Pavilion for Women and Infants includes eight labor rooms, 32 postpartum rooms, three operating suites for cesarean sections and a three-room midwife center. It occupies the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors of the hospital and is named for a $12 million gift from Evelyn and Ernest Rady, whose names are also on the UC San Diego School of Management and San Diego's Children's Hospital. The pavilion includes a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to monitor and care for severely premature or ill infants. Pregnant women and new mothers also have access to non-invasive fetal genetic testing, wireless fetal heart rate monitoring during labor, fertility preservation, and preeclampsia detection and treatment. The hospital has views of UC San Diego, the Torrey Pines Mesa, La Jolla and the Pacific Ocean.  Amenities that Promote Healing Big Yellow Poppies by Donald Sultan is the first work patients experience in the Jacobs Healing Arts Collection In addition to providing advanced specialty care, Jacobs Medical Center offers several hospital-wide amenities, designed to facilitate comfort and healing. It is home to a museum-quality 150-piece curated art collection, called the Jacobs Healing Arts Collection. Curated by Joan Jacobs, the collection includes paintings, prints, and sculptures by renowned artists including Damien Hirst, Beatriz Milhazes, Julian Schnabel, Donald Sultan, Ryan McGinness, and Eva Struble. It also has multiple garden terraces and floor-to-ceiling windows in every patient room to create a more soothing and natural environment for healing. Hospital fare has also been upgraded. Patients order meals through a room service attendant who provides a personalized menu of local fare selected and crafted by executive chef Rodney Fry. Meals can also be ordered at The Cove at Thornton Pavilion. Additionally, each hospital room is equipped with an iPad and Apple TV for patients to control lighting, temperature, and entertainment. Patients can download apps and stream their content to the Apple TV, and will also be able to contact their care team and view patient records through an Epic Systems application, administered through Jamf infrastructure. Patients create unique passcodes for their iPads, which are digitally and literally sterilized at the end of their stay.

It is dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. It is located in Chikka Tirupathi hobli of Malur Taluk, in the outskirts of Bengaluru in the South Indian state of Karnataka. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is considered similar to the Tirupathi Venkateswara temple. Vishnu is worshipped as Venkateshwara and his consort Lakshmi as Alamelumangamma. The temple is open from 6.30 am to 7:30 pm (all days of week) and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Brahmotsava, the major festival, is celebrated annually during Shravana Shaniwaara during which the festival images of the presiding deities are taken in a parade around the streets of the temple in a chariot. An interesting part of this lord Venkateshwara idol is that it is an Abhayahastha (hand showing upwards as blessing) whereas in Tirupathi at Andhra Pradesh, Lord's hand is showing downwards. Hence this is considered to be special. Visitors can continue their holy travel towards Kolar where they can have good time in visiting Koti Lingas, Mulabagilu, Antharagange much more. Chikkathirupathy is just 15 KM from taluk headquarters Malur, 26 km from ITPL and 30 km from Koramangala. The Temple Image of the flagstaff and the second hall leading to the sanctum The legend of the place relates to the episode of Kandava Dahana in epic Mahabarata. During the dahana Takshaka escaped the forest with little injuries and he cursed Lord Agni to lose his divinity. As suggested by Lord Shiva, Agni prayed to the lord Vishnu here in this region and regained his status. https://gotirupati.com/chikka- tirupati Venkateswara temple is built in Dravidian architecture and the exact history of the temple is not known. The inscriptions in Mysore records indicate that the temple is a few centuries old. The temple has a 5-tiered gopura. The temple tank is located north of the temple. The central shrine houses the image of Venkateshwara in standing posture. There are two precincts around the temple. From the entrance tower, the central shrine is located in the axis through the Dwajasthamba (flagstaff), pillar of offering and Garuda Mantapa. The image of Garuda, the eagle mount of Venkateshwara, is housed in the Garuda Mantapa, facing the image of the presiding deity. The temple in modern times is administered by the Department of Religious Endowment, Government of Karnataka. It is located 25 km away from Hoskote. Temple Timings : Morning 6 AM to Evening 7:30 PM and no closure of temple in between during afternoon time. Temple is open through out all the 7 days of week. Worship practices and festivals Image of the shrine around the sanctum The temple priests perform the pooje (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples in the nearby state Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alankaara (decoration), neivedhya (food offering) and deepa aradane (waving of lamps) for both Venkateshwara and his consort Alamelumanga. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is considered holy as the Tirupathi Venkateswara temple and devotees from other states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu visit the temple. As of November 2012, the temple had an annual revenue of 1 crore. The Brahmotsavam, the major festival, is celebrated annually during Shravana Shaniwara during which the festival images of the presiding deities are taken in a parade around the streets of the temple in a chariot.

In the series she is Wiske's beloved rag doll. Between 1986 and 1993 Schanulleke received her own spin-off series. The character's name in English is Molly, Sawdust or Muffin. History Schanulleke was introduced in the very first panel of Suske en Wiske, along with her owner Wiske, namely in the album Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije (1945). Her original name was \\"Schalulleke\\", later changed into \\"Schabolleke\\" for publication in the Netherlands, both Flemish dialect expressions for a scallion. When it was later decided to use one translation for both the Netherlands and Flanders her name was changed again from \\"Schalulleke\\" to \\"Schanulleke\\", because the word \\"lul\\" is Dutch slang for \\"penis\\".http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/schanulleke The name change became official in the Suske en Wiske story \\"De Schone Slaper\\" (\\"Sleeping Beau\\") (1965) Vandersteen, Willy, \\"De Schone Slaper\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1965. Character Schanulleke is a little rag doll, always portrayed wearing a red dress, indicating it is female. Wiske loves her with a passion and treats her like a mother. She is always heartbroken whenever Schanulleke is kidnapped, lost or threatened. Whenever people mock her for loving a doll at her age she feels insulted. In some stories the kidnapping of Schanulleke brings the plot into motion, like \\"Prinses Zagemeel\\" (\\"Princess Sawdust\\") (1949), \\"De Knokkersburcht\\" (\\"The Batterers' Fortress\\") (1953) and \\"De Laatste Vloek\\" (\\"The Last Curse\\") (2002). She is also brought to life in \\"Bibbergoud\\" (1950), \\"De Sterrenplukkers\\" (1952), \\"Het Vliegende Bed\\" (1959), \\"De Dulle Griet\\" (1966), \\"De Poppenpakker\\" (1973), \\"De Vlijtige Vlinder\\" (1976), \\"Sony-San\\" (1986), \\"De Mysterieuze Mijn\\" (1990), \\"Amber\\" (1999), \\"De Kus van Odfella\\" (2003) and \\"De Gevangene van Prisonov\\" (2003). Despite being an inanimate object and usually not being the focus of the stories Schanulleke is still one of the few characters in the franchise who has been present in most of the stories. Spin-off From 1986 until 1993 Schanulleke received her own comic strip. The first two stories, \\"Eiko, de wijze boom\\" and \\"Schanulleke in de dierentuin\\" were drawn by Willy Vandersteen himself and were long stories. He also gave her a sidekick: the clown doll Duddul. Later his studio employees, Eric De Rop https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/de- rop_eric.htm and Patty Klein https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/klein.htm, continued the series, but as a gag-a-day comic.

Her firm won the \\"Design Competition for a Sustainable Neighborhood and Farmers Market\\" on Staten Island, New York. Another interesting project Dubbeldam designed is for the National Building Museum's 2004 exhibition on the theme of masonry variations. For this project she adopted materials like bricks, lightweight concrete blocks, stone and terrazo for the structural components. The exhibit was created by her, like the other three architects who were also assigned this task. She created a \\"fluid concrete gorge\\", like the Buckskin Gulch at Utah's Paria canyon. She adopted advanced digital analysis for the chamber in which it was built and the concrete was evolved with a fourth dimension by hanging speakers above the irregular shape of concrete which panned the surfaces. The \\"scrambled sound waves reorganized as they hit any surface and thus emitted unusual pulses that bounced off and around the shapes, converting the entire assembly into an extraordinary, almost theatrical phantasmagorical sound garden\\".

He is best known as an icon of the Tongcheng school of literary prose which was influential during the mid-Qing dynasty.  Family origins  Fang Bao was born in Tongcheng, Zongyang County, Anhui Province in 1668 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. He was the second son in a family of the Qing nobility with landed interests at Jiangning, Liuhe County and at Tongcheng, an area in the southern vicinity of Nanjing. His father was Fang Zhongshu (), an imperial official and second son of Fang's grandfather. His paternal grandfather was Fang Zhi (), a Xinghua County didactic and noted scholar of the Wuhe discipline. Fang Bao was the middle son of three boys, his elder brother was Fang Zhou (ÊñπËàü; 1665-1701), a scholar of the Five Classics, and his younger brother was Fang Lin ().  Early life  At the time of Fang Bao's birth, the Kangxi Emperor had not yet fully assumed power and the real dominance over the throne was in the hands of two of the Four Regents, Ebilun and Oboi. In 1669, as the Kangxi Emperor consolidated power, Oboi was also brought up on imperial charges and put to death. Fang Bao studied literature at a school which followed the teachings of Gui Youguang. He would go on to invent the concept of Yi Fa where Yi refers to the ideas or concept of an article and Fa to the structure and literary form. This concept is considered one of the basic theories of the Tongcheng School form of writing, which gained its name due to Tongcheng being Fang Bao's hometown. From 1692 to 1695, Fang served in Beijing as a senior licentiate together with his friend Zhang Boxing who shared his philosophical allegiance surrounding the teachings of the brothers Cheng Xi and Zhu Xi. Fang obtained his jinshi degree or advanced scholar degree following the imperial examination system in 1706 under the reign of the Kangxi Emperor and was given a posting at the Hall of Military Glory () as its Director-General of Compilation (). He was promoted within the hall to the position of Instructor-Bachelor () and then to Vice-Minister of Rights (). In either 1711 or 1713, whilst still at the Hall of Military Glory, Fang was involved in the Nanshan Incident (). The incident surrounded the contents of a work written by Dai Mingshi, Fang's relation via his wife, titled Nanshan Ji () for which Fang had written a preface. The book was essentially a nostalgic history of one of the author's ancestors who had fought with Wu Sangui against the Qing Empire. As a result of a political realignment, the work had been judged seditious by the court of the Kangxi Emperor, who previously promoted scholarly officials. The political change on the part of the Qing court was due in large part to the emperor's awareness and perception of threat from political factions that were forming for the purpose of influencing the imperial succession. Fang was arrested by the Governor of Suzhou, his friend Zhang Boxing. Dai was executed by imperial order, but Fang was spared death and punished instead with dismissal from his post and exile to Gansu Province or (likely both) with the imprisonment of his entire family. Zhang would also later be accused of aiding Fang Bao before the court but he was unpunished. In 1728, the death of an Eleuth leader provided an excuse for the new Yongzheng Emperor to continue his father's wars in Gansu Province. Fang Bao had written a bold critique of the Governor of Gansu Province, Xu Rong and the Yongzheng Emperor's strategy with regards to the effects of the war on the people of the region. Despite this writing, by the end of the Yongzheng era, Fang was back in the imperial court's favor and he was promoted to Vice-Director of the Board of Rights. Fang Bao's critical work of the Yongzheng Emperor proved influential in around 1735 when the incoming Qianlong Emperor used it to indict Xu Rong as a part of his larger purge of government officials to cement his hold on power. Accordingly, Fang was made the Vice-Director of the Bureau for the compilation of the Three Ritual Classics. In this role, he gained imperial support to pursue one of his most famous works, the \\"Imperial Anthology of Essays on the Four Books\\" which transformed the entire imperial writing system.  Death and legacy  Fang Bao died in 1749. One of his lasting contributions to the imperial system apart from his literary writings was the establishment of the guwen style as the essay style of the imperial examination system which thereafter put emphasis on Song dynasty neo-Confucian theory. This influence drastically changed the imperial examination system which imposed standards and made the guwen essays the foundational part of scholarly writing across the Qing Empire. Fang Bao is an ancestor of Fang Gongcheng, a tutor of the Qing imperial court, of Fang Guancheng, the Viceroy of Zhili, of Fang Chih, the influential cold war-era statesman of the Republic of China, Thom√© H. Fang, a philosopher and contemporary of Fang Chih and of Anna Sui, the American fashion designer.

It took place from 18 January to 28 February 1942. The objective of the airborne landing was to help troops of the Kalinin Front and Western Front to encircle and destroy Army Group Centre. The airborne operation was unsuccessful and resulted in the loss of most of the troops landed.  Battle  The Rzhev-Vyazma Offensive began on 8 January 1942 with the aim of encircling Army Group Centre. In the first stages of the operation, the Red Army achieved some successes. As a result of the attacks of the Kalinin and Western Fronts, the German lines were breached in several places. In order to facilitate the advance of the troops, Stavka decided to land troops south of Vyazma with the objective of cutting the Vyazma-Yukhnov highway and the Vyazma-Bryansk railroad. The planned drop zone was guarded by scattered German units. The first group of airborne troops, composed of the 201st Airborne Brigade and the 250th Airborne Regiment, was landed in the rear of German troops south of Vyazma from 18 to 22 January. The landing was made at night, and the paratroopers presence in the German rear helped the attacks of the 33rd Army and 1st Guards Cavalry Corps. At the end of January, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, under the command of Pavel Alexeyevich Belov, broke through the German lines. To prevent a German retreat from the planned encirclement, Stavka decided to land troops in the Vyazma area to cut the Vyazma-Smolensk railroads and highways. On 27 January, the dropping of 4th Airborne Corps in the village of Ozerechnya. Due to a shortage of transport planes, the paratroop drops were made in an alternating order, starting with 8th Airborne Brigade. German aircraft actively opposed the transport planes. As a result of German bombing raids on airfields, 7 Tupolev TB-3 transport aircraft were destroyed. There was also very little fighter cover for the transports and many were shot down. As a result of this, as well as worsening weather conditions, Stavka was forced to suspend drops. However, three battalions of the 8th Airborne Brigade, comprising 2,100 airborne troops had been landed by 1 February, along with 34.4 tons of supplies. The landing itself was unsuccessful, as a large part of the supplies were lost, and the airborne troops were scattered over a wide area in winter weather conditions. As a result, only 1,320 paratroopers were able to reform into coherent units. The airborne troops attempted to cut German communications west of Vyazma. In a few days, they knocked out some parts of the railroad and highway and captured the headquarters of some German units. On 31 January, German Chief of the Army General Staff Franz Halder wrote that \\"The position of the troops of the 4th Army is very serious. There have been difficulties with supply.\\" By 6 February, the survivors of the 8th Airborne Brigade had linked up with 1st Guards Cavalry Corps. Its units were included in the corps structure after the linkup. By mid-February in the area of Vyazma an extremely difficult situation had developed. The Soviet forces failed to encircle the German troops and the fighting dragged on. Stavka decided to drop the main forces of the 4th Airborne Corps west of Yukhnov with the task of cutting the Warsaw highway and linking up with parts of the 50th Army. The landing of the 9th and 214th Airborne Brigades took place at night from 16 to 24 February. During this period, 1525 paratroopers and 7373 supply bales were dropped in the area of Zelanje. The landing took place with the active opposition of the Germans. On 23 February, the 4th Airborne Corps commander Major General Alexei Levashev was killed, when his transport was shot down. Corps chief of staff Colonel Alexander Kazankin assumed command. On the ground, the airborne troops faced strong German resistance. However, the airborne troops were able to link up with the 50th Army on 28 February, but the ground troops were unable to break through the German lines, and the offensive stalled.  Aftermath  Left in the German rear, 4th Airborne Corps, in conjunction with the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps and elements of 33rd Army conducted active military operations. Elements of the airborne troops were destroyed during Operation Hannover. In early April, the combined forces were placed under command of Major General Pavel Alexeyevich Belov. The united forces seized the area south of Vyazma and held it until the end of May, pinning down a few German divisions. On the night of 26 May, the group broke through the encirclement and joined the 10th Army to the north of Kirov on 24 June.

He is the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).The main aim of IPOB is to create an independent state for the people of old Eastern Region of Nigeria through referendum. Kanu is the director of a UK registered radio station named Radio Biafra. Kanu was arrested on treason charges in Lagos, Nigeria on 14 October 2015 and was detained for more than a year, despite various court orders that ruled for his release. When in court, Kanu appeared regularly wearing a Jewish prayer shawl and head covering. He said in court, that he \\"believes in Judaism\\" and considers himself a Jew and oftentimes has led his Biafran people to various Jewish prayers and religious observations. On 28 April 2017, Kanu was released from prison on bail. Early life Kanu was born in Isiama Afara Ukwu, Umuahia, Abia State, the Republic of Biafra. His father is Eze Israel Okwu Kanu (JP) and his mother, Ugoeze Nnenne Kanu. He attended Library Avenue Primary School and went to Government College Umuahia for his secondary education. He studied at University of Nigeria, Nsukka and moved to the UK before graduating. Activism =Awareness= On 5 September 2015, Nnamdi Kanu was a guest speaker at the World Igbo Congress which was held in Los Angeles, where he told his audience \\"we need guns and we need bullets\\". In an interview in June 2017, Kanu explained his comment saying that he demanded for bullets and guns from a group of US-based Nigerians for self-defense against the incessant attacks on Igbos by Fulani herdsmen which were currently reoccurring in Biafra lands. =Civil disobedience= Kanu's pronounced strategy has been the application of civil disobedience in pressing home his demand for the freedom of his people. In various air broadcasts, Nnamdi Kanu stated how his adoption of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi's forms of civil disobedience will lead to the \\"restoration of Biafra\\". In an interview granted to Newsweek, Nnamdi Kanu opined his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, \\"I hope that what we are looking for can be accomplished peacefully. I am an advocate of passive resistance. Gandhi and Martin Luther King tried it to very good effects, so why should it not work in our case?\\" Prior to the 2019 presidential election, IPOB had threatened to boycott the election. According to the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, \\"It [the boycott] is a multi-faceted approach. It is civil disobedience, passive resistance, it is an expression of our resentment of Nigeria and what it represents\\". His position on election boycotts was widely criticised by local Nigerian politicians who argued to the contrary. On the eve of the election, Nnamdi Kanu lifted the boycott position and urged Biafrans to participate in the election after which he described as his condition as \\"signed, sealed and delivered\\". His shift was received in different quarters as being open to the appeal and opinions of others. Imprisonment =Arrest= On 18 October 2015, it was reported that Kanu had been arrested in Lagos State by Nigeria's secret police, the Department of State Services (DSS). Kanu had told his solicitors that on 14 October 2015, he was arrested by the agents of the Federal Government of Nigeria, the State Security Service (SSS), in his hotel room at the Golden Tulip Essential Hotel Ikeja, Lagos State. The solicitors in a press briefing said, between 14 and 17 October 2015 their client's whereabouts were unknown until 18 October 2015, when the press media broke the news of his arrest and detention by the SSS in Abuja. The news of the arrest of Kanu generated protests across Delta State, Enugu State, Rivers State, Cross River State, Abia State, Imo State, Akwa Ibom Sate, Bayelsa State and Anambra State. =Detention= On 19 October 2015, it was reported that Nnamdi Kanu had been granted bail after a secret arraignment at Magistrate Court, Wuse 11. However, the bail seemed \\"controversial\\" and there were claims the DSS announced the bail only \\"to calm the angry people of Biafra\\". Office =Court jurisdiction= The Magistrate Court 1 sitting in Abuja on 18 November 2015 ordered the Department of State Services (DSS) to produce Kanu at the court on 23 November 2015. However, it was reported the Department of State Services (DSS) obtained a \\"secret court order to detain Nnamdi Kanu\\". Kanu's lawyer, Obetta, in an interview said whilst in court, the prosecutor gave him a document containing a court order permitting the Department of State Services (DSS) to detain Kanu for the next three months to \\"conclude what they said was an investigation of terrorism and terrorism financing\\". =Court trial= Kanu was finally arraigned on 23 November 2015 in an Abuja Magistrate Court for the first time for charges of \\"criminal conspiracy, intimidation and membership of an illegal organisation\\" by Nigeria's Department of State Services (DSS). The charges violate \\"Section 97, 97B and 397\\" of Nigeria's penal code. Chief Magistrate S. Usman had, at the last adjourned date, berated the Department of State Services (DSS) over its failure to produce Kanu in court on the two consecutive times the matter came up before the court. Meanwhile, Kanu's supporters stormed Nigeria's capital city of Abuja in luxury buses on a peaceful protest for their leader who was arraigned by the Federal Government before the Wuse Zone 2 Magistrate Court, Abuja on 23 November 2015. Pro-Biafra protesters with placards sang and danced outside the court premises whilst the hearing proceeded. Protesters wore T-shirts and caps with inscriptions like \\"Biafra Now or Never\\", \\"Buhari Release Kanu For Us\\", \\"On Biafra We Stand\\". More protests by IPOB members numbering over 15,000 grounded vehicular movements in the southeastern key economic city of Onitsha concurrently. It was the same with over 20,000 protesters in Aba, Abia State on the same day. Kanu, through his counsel, filed an application asking the federal authorities to transfer him from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) to prison. His lawyer, Obetta, insisted that transferring his client to prison would enable him to have easy access to his legal team. Whilst in court, the Department of State Services (DSS) requested the Wuse Zone 2 Senior Magistrates' Court, to discontinue the trial of Nnamdi Kanu under section 108(1) of administration of criminal justice act 2015. Idakwo further said the Department of State Services (DSS) had obtained an order from the Federal High Court, Abuja, dated 10 November, to detain the accused in its custody for 90 days. However, Kanu's lawyer Obetta objected to the continued detention of his client. Obetta prayed the court not to discontinue the case because the prosecution did not present any information from the Attorney-General of Nigeria Federation who had the authority to approve such. Obetta also told the court that \\"the DSS violated the order of the court which granted bail that was perfected but not granted, adding that the accused had been in Department of State Services (DSS) custody since he was arrested.\\" The court's magistrate, Usman Shuaibu, after listening to both counsels, adjourned the matter until 1 December 2015 for ruling. He is still wanted by the Nigerian authority after committing treason causing the death of so many eastern youths. =Prison release= On 20 October 2015, Vanguard announced that Kanu had been released on bail. However, media sources supporting the objectives of IPOB called the bail \\"controversial\\" and claimed the DSS announced the bail only \\"to calm the angry people of Biafra\\". Kanu has finally been released on bail by Justice Binta Nyako for health reasons. =Disappearance= Kanu disappeared from public view after his home was raided by the Nigerian military in September 2017. There had been speculations regarding his whereabouts for over a year with members of his IPOB accusing the Buhari government of masterminding his abduction. He would later reappear in October 2018 after photographs and videos of him in Israel were widely circulated on social media. He has continued to tour various countries in Europe while a case of treason brought against him by the government of Nigeria continues to lie pending. Controversy Kanu has since the beginning of his advocacy made highly controversial comments on various occasions. ‚Ä¢Sometime in 2017, a video of Kanu was released wherein he issued an open death threat to former Nigerian president Chief Obasanjo. He had told a gathering of supporters at his home that if any harm comes to him, members of IPOB should eliminate Obasanjo and his lineage. This was in reference to Obasanjo's statement at a gathering in Abuja that all must be done to Stop IPOB.

Family History and Early Life  Fang Chih was born into the prominent Tongcheng Fang clan in Tongcheng, Anhui, Qing empire in November 1895. His father was Fang Rong (, courtesy: ÊñπÈïúÂçø), the middle son of Fang Lanfen, a Qing dynasty author. He is a direct descendant of Fang Zhipu (ÊñπËá≥Êú¥) and Fang Zhenru (ÊñπÈúáÂ≠∫), an early Qing scholar, author, magistrate and Governor of Guangxi Province. He was also a descendant of Fang Bao, a distinguished Qing author who founded the Tongcheng school of literary prose. His paternal uncles were Fang Quan, a late Qing dynasty era prefect and Fang Zao (, courtesy: ÊñπÊæÑÂçø). Fang's father died when he was 1 or 2 years old in 1896 and his mother sent him to be raised by his paternal uncle Fang Quan and paternal grandfather.  Education  Fang Chih graduated from Anhui Province Tongcheng Secondary School (), known as a producer of many revolutionary Anhui leaders, which he attended alongside Zhang Bojun, Wu Zipei (), and Yu Guanglang among other notable classmates. Due to the hostility between the Beiyang government regime and the KMT, many of the KMT families moved into exile in Japan and Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition defeated Beiyang by 1928. In 1919, with financial support from his uncle, Fang Peiqing (zh: ÊñπÂüπÂçø), Fang Chi went to Tokyo, Japan where he learned Japanese and pursued his studies at the Tokyo Higher Normal School and the Tokyo Imperial University. On 14 July 1925, Fang married Masue Ueki (Fang I-chih, ), a Japanese woman, fellow Kuomintang member and classmate at the Tokyo Imperial University studying dentistry. He would graduate with a master's degree from the College of Arts and Science at Tokyo Imperial University in 1927. Whilst at school, Fang was involved in the leadership structure of the KMT student groups active in Japan in the Chinese student community. These groups were founded by the Tongmenghui clique cemented in Japan by Wang Jingwei. The KMT student organization was set up in the Kanda district where a Chinese communist group was already active at the Tokyo YMCA. Specifically, Fang was involved in countering Communist propaganda and student groups run by Japanese educated Chinese Communists such as Shi Qian (zh: Âè≤ËøÅ), Wang Buwen, Tong Changrong (zh: Á´•ÈïøËç£), Yu Dahua (zh: ‰ΩôÂ§ßÂåñ) and Fang Bin (zh: ÊàøÊñå) at the Hubei Railway School of Tokyo or the Tokyo Railway Specialized School, a school set up by Zhang Zhidong for Chinese international students whose graduates went on to serve in the railway industry at Hubei for 6 years.  Return from Japan  Fang Chih returned from Japan in 1927. After his return, he joined the Northern Expedition of Chiang Kai-shek working in Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei Provinces where he gained the attention of General Chiang. He was made the Chairman of the Fukien Provincial Party Headquarters of the KMT at the suggestion of a fellow Japanese educated classmate Dai Chuanxian with Chiang's approval. This role was expanded to oversee the KMT Chairmanship of Anhwei Provincial Party Headquarters and that of Tsingtao. Whilst in Anhwei, Fang Chi led a political purge of the local party together with Shao Hua on the orders of Chen Lifu, founder of the CC Clique or the Central Club Clique and head of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Committee. The purge mechanism in Anhwei later swept up his former rival and classmate from Japan, Wang Buwen who was arrested in April 1931 and executed the following month. His work during this period was focused primarily in Hupeh, Kiangsi, Qingdao, Nanking, Hunan, Anhwei and Fukien provinces in various military, political, party affairs and education related jobs. His organizational skills and writing ability soon gained the attention of Chen Lifu, with whom he regularly corresponded. The connection with Chen Lifu aligned Fang with the CC Clique faction of the KMT and led to his increased involvement in the operations of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. By March 1929, he was promoted to Chief Secretary of the Department of Propaganda of the Central Committee by Shao Yuanchong who was one of four people responsible for the lyrics of the National Anthem of the Republic of China. He was posted to Nanking and Shanghai. In 1930, he was acting Minister of Information and by September 1931, he was promoted to the Chief Secretary of the Publicity Committee.ÂàòÊï¨Âù§ÔºéÊñπÊ≤ªÂÖ∂‰∫∫[J]ÔºéÊ∞ëÂõΩÊò•ÁßãÔºå1994Ôºà2ÔºâÔºö42Ôºç46  Information Ministry Activities  In the early 1930s, rumors in Shanghai began spreading of an assassination list compiled by a secretive KMT group that became collectively known as the Blue Shirts Society. By 1933, these rumors began to come into the mainstream Shanghai press, particularly due to articles printed in the left leaning China Forum published by American radical Harold Isaacs. On 20 July 1933, due to the perceived negative public perception, Fang published an article in the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury denouncing the rumors and the existence of the Blue Shirts saying \\"No Blue Shirts; No (death) list, its all wrong.\\" In fact, the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the CC Clique's counterintelligence organ was heavily involved in myriad kill or capture missions in Shanghai during this period. In 1929, Zhou Enlai returned to Shanghai, after a brief period of exile following the 1927 Shanghai Massacre, to set up the Communist response to the KMT called the \\"Special Service Section of the Central Committee\\" or \\"Teke\\" (zh: ‰∏≠Â§ÆÁâπÁßë). This led to a bloodbath culminating in the summer of 1931 with a full blown purge and the second flight of Zhou Enlai from the city. In April 1931, KMT agents arrested Gu Shunzhang in Wuhan. Gu was one of Zhou's Aides of Security Affairs and his interrogation and subsequent defection from the Communists yielded to the Nationalists the entire scope of Zhou's operations in Shanghai and beyond. On 21 June 1931, Gu's entire section of the Special Service was either captured or fled with 24 arrested including his superior and General Secretary Xiang Zhongfa in Shanghai and Cai Hesen in Hong Kong. Xiang was quickly executed after his interrogation and the resulting windfall of information led the KMT to conduct an even greater purge of the Communist intelligence networks. The scope of this purge was put at around 3,000 Communists by the French Intelligence Bureau of the Shanghai French Concession and lasted until at least 1934 as the Communists from Jianxi attempted to reestablish networks in Guangzhou and Shanghai under Chen Geng and Deng Zhongxia. Deng and Chen were both arrested though only Deng was executed as Chen had saved Chiang Kai-shek's life during a previous battle against the Warlord Chen Jiongming. Gu Shunzhang, was executed in Suzhou in December 1934 or June 1935. By 1935, the counterintelligence situation had quieted down with most of the Communist networks significantly weakened. Fang was an elected to become a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, attending the Kuomintang 5th National Congress in November where he was confirmed as Deputy Minister of Propaganda. He was also transferred again, this time to Tsingtao Municipality and served as the KMT Chairman of the region.  CC Clique  As Deputy Minister of Propaganda in the period leading up to war with Japan between 1931 and 1937, Fang began to focus his activities on exploiting what he perceived to be a growing division between a majority of the Japanese population being largely desirous of peace and a minority of pro- militant actors supporting an invasion of China policy embedded in high places within the Japanese government since the tenure of Tanaka Giichi as Prime Minister and headed contemporarily by Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. In around 1935, Fang organized a daily radio broadcast in Japanese operating from two pseudo official Japanese stations located in Fukuoka and Nagasaki respectively. The messages conveyed were on the mutual destruction that war would bring to both nations, the shared history and culture between Japan and the ROC. The broadcasts ceased after a serious diplomatic incident between Japan and the ROC ensued following a party at the Japanese Consulate General in Nanking where Deputy Foreign Minister and Foreign Affairs Secretary and Wang Jingwei loyalist Tang Youren () let slip that the radio program was being run under Fang's supervision. Once the information reached Tokyo, the Japanese government issued the ROC an ultimatum to either extradite both Fang and his wife to Japan or a Japanese battleship would be dispatched from Shanghai to Nanking to raid the KMT Headquarters. In response, KMT Secretary General Yeh Chucang () requested that Fang terminate the program. The matter was deferred to Chiang Kai-shek who decided to stop the broadcasts but moved to protect Fang. He also asserted that any incursions into the Nanking area by Japanese naval forces would be met with force. On 1 November 1935, Wang Jingwei stepped down from his post when he was shot at by a sniper in an assassination attempt just before the 5th National Congress. Tang Youren was relieved of his duties as Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister in early December 1935 and transferred to become Vice Minister at the Ministry of Transport and Communications. He was assassinated in Shanghai on 25 December 1935 before assuming his new role.ËÉ°ÈÅ©Êó•Ë®òÂÖ®ÈõÜÔºàÁ¨¨‰∏ÉÂÜäÔºâÔºåÁ¨¨286-287È†ÅËºâÊúâ‰∏ÄÂâáÂâ™Â†±ÔºåÁÑ°Â†±ÂêçÂèäÊó•ÊúüÊπñÂçóÁúÅÂøóÔºà30Ôºâ‰∫∫Áâ©ÂøóÔºö‰∏ãÂÜåÔºåÊπñÂçó‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºåÁ¨¨345-346È°µÂÇ≥Ë®òÊñáÂ≠∏88Ôºà1-6ÔºâÔºåÂÇ≥Ë®òÊñáÂ≠∏ÈõúË™åÁ§æÔºå2006Âπ¥ÔºåÁ¨¨127È°µÂº†ÂìÅÂÖ¥„ÄÅÂàò‰ΩëÁîüÔºåÁèæ‰ª£‰∏≠ÂõΩÊîøÁïåË¶Å‰∫∫‰º†Áï•Â§ßÂÖ®Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÂπøÊí≠ÁîµË¶ñÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå1993Âπ¥ÔºåÁ¨¨772È°µËΩ¶ÂêâÂøÉÔºåÊ∞ëÂúãËªº‰∫ã9ÔºåÊ≥∞Â±±Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2004Âπ¥ Fang attended the Second National Motion-Picture Conference which was convened by the Central Party Publicity Committee in Shanghai. Fang used the motion picture industry in Shanghai to promote KMT party ideals to the people. These propagated the ideas of the New Life Movement which was the brainchild of General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling and was supported by the CC Clique and the Blue Shirts Society. In October 1935, Fang collaborated with Zhang Daofan, Lei Chen, and Yu Shangyuan to build the Nanjing National Theatre Academy where Yu was installed as president. The school was run as an organ of the KMT Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Education. In 1938, a second school was opened in Sichuan, Jiang'an County and named the National Theatre Academy. It was the first modern drama school for higher education ever built in China. In November 1935 at a meeting of the KMT Big Five, Fang Chih was elected to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang cementing his position as a prominent fixture of the administration. In July 1936, there was a shakeup of the propaganda department after Liu Luyin was arrested on spy charges by Dai Li who was carrying out a purge of the party and Fang became the vice minister of the Board of Publicity. On 13 August 1937, Fang was transferred to the Ministry of Education, a department run by Minister and KMT Party Chairman Wang Shijie. The following year, Chen Lifu was appointed as Minister of Education.  Ministry of Education  In October 1938, with the CC Clique's hold on the Ministry of Education in place, Fang Chih was appointed to the position of Education Commissioner of his native Anhwei Province (Anhui Province) and of Hupeh Province (Hubei Province). On 19 May 1938, a squadron of two Chinese Air Force Martin B-10 bombers took off from Ningbo. The squadron flew over Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Kurume, Kyushu, Saga, and Sasebo distributing over 1 million leaflets containing various propaganda and disinformation, completing the mission with no human losses. In the late 1800s, Fang's uncle Fang Quan, who was a late-Qing era prefect and Tongcheng School literary figure, returned to Tongcheng to oversee the establishment of the Huabiao Primary School (zh: ÂçéË°®Â∞èÂ≠¶), serving for a time as its principal. Fang oversaw the completion of Anhui Number 4 Provincial Primary School (zh: ÂÆâÂæΩÁúÅÁúÅÁ´ãÁ¨¨Âõõ‰∏¥Êó∂Â∞èÂ≠¶‰ºöÂÆ´ÂàÜÊ†°) in 1939.  Chungking  In early 1941, Fang Chih was named the Party Chief and Chairman of the KMT in Chungking. He was again elected to the Central Executive Committee at the 6th National Congress of Kuomintang in May 1945. In January 1946, Fang Chih was involved in an effort to disrupt Communist rally activities in Chungking celebrating the legalization of the CCP the previous year. The rallies which were held throughout January and early February, were hosted by high level Communist representatives like Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Ma Yinchu, Li Dequan who acted as general chairman and Li Gongpu who acted as the organizational commander. Chen Lifu tasked Fang, Ye Xiufeng and Wang Sicheng (zh: ÁéãÊÄùËØö) with organizing the violent suppression of the rallies. Fang's agents spied heavily on the rallies in efforts to document the Communist opposition forces who were operating in the open following the Double Tenth Agreement. Fang also collaborated with Chen Lifu, Ye Xiufeng and Wang Sicheng to move against the Communists by mobilizing large scale anti-Soviet marches around Chungking. From 16‚Äì19 January, Guo Moruo, Zhang Dongsun and other Communists were attacked. On 26 January, police raided the home of Huang Yanpei, a Democratic League agitator and CCP ally. This series of confrontations boiled over on 10 February with the Jiaochangkou Incident which has been recorded as one of the major triggers leading to escalation in the Chinese Civil War. The incident has been covered in many historical accounts, including most recently, the 2009 propaganda film The Founding of a Republic. The Communists were meeting to celebrate the People's Consultative Conference and the concentration of radical Communist elements attracted the KMT secret police who violently dispersed the crowd though no actual fatalities were recorded though around 60 were wounded, some seriously. Both the KMT and the Communists used the incident to push for military escalation. Mao Zedong pushed for the CCP to withdraw entirely from the unity government and to pursue a military campaign following the incident, which he argued could be taken to mean that Chiang Kai-shek was not committed to peace. The KMT also used the incident to justify further crack downs on an increasingly active and anti-KMT CCP. Li Gongpu was assassinated by KMT agents on 11 July 1946 in Kunming. Li's funeral was also targeted on 15 July resulting in the assassination of Wen Yiduo.  Shanghai  In October 1946, Fang Chih was made the party boss and chairman of the Shanghai KMT Municipal Government, replacing Wu Shao-hsu, one of his longtime rivals within the CC Clique. He was also made General Secretary of the Beijing-Hangzhou Government Garrison Headquarters Standing Committee. With the cessation of all the foreign concession areas by 1946, the city, was entirely under Nationalist control. During his tenure, Fang Chih collaborated with Du Yuesheng of the Green Gang to consolidate various agitation groups and to root out Communist activity. By May 1946, Fang was dealing with increasingly serious political tension between Communist and Government student groups. These tensions boiled over in June when the opposing groups staged demonstrations with the pro- government groups rallying on 21 June and the Communists on 23 June. Between 1946 and 1949 during Fang's tenure in office, the population of Shanghai swelled from around 3.7 million in 1946 to 7.73 million in 1949 with Shanghai accounting for around 50 percent of all the factories in China, more than half of all Chinese shipping trade and roughly 33 percent of China's total GDP. In 1947, Fang was elected to the political council of the Kuomintang. In September 1947, the Nationalist government attempted a ban on commercial dance halls as an austerity measure to be implemented due to the ongoing civil war. In response to the unpopular decision, which was implemented slowly and reluctantly by the Shanghai government, 200,000 taxi dancers took to the streets and riots ensued. Fang's propaganda machine attempted to ease the situation with statements saying that dancing girls should be redirecting their talents to reconstructing the country and eliminating the Communist bandits. A Time magazine article quoted Fang attempts in this regards: I think no patriotic man or woman wants to embrace each other under soft lights... Dancing girls could be trained to acquire useful talents in reconstructing the country and wiping out bandits.... Fang also made attempts to turn the selected dance halls that were actually closed into cafeterias employing the former taxi dancers. In the end, the halfhearted ban served to drastically increase prostitution in the city, an issue that remained even after the government completely abandoned any further attempts to shutter the dance halls. Towards 1949, as a successful Nationalist defense of Shanghai became less likely, the problem became a useful way to lash out at the city's future management. By the time the Communists took over the city in 1949, there were around 40,000 licensed and unlicensed prostitutes operating in the city. The prostitution problem was a large obstacle for the Communists and remained an issue for them until around 1953 when prostitutes were sent en masse to labor camps. In August 1948, Fang delivered a speech to a large scale anti-Communist rally in Shanghai together with mayor K.C. Wu and Chairman of the City Council, Pan Kung-chan. In early 1949, the tide of the war was beginning to turn decidedly in favor of the Communists following the developments in the Huaihai and Pingjin Campaigns. The Nationalist army had lost around 1.5 million soldiers between 1948 and 1949. On 6 January 1949, Fang made a proposal to send a delegation of Shanghai's citizens to speak with Communist officials, following a convening of Kuomintang policy makers which resulted in an agreement to attempt to sue for peace. The move was seen as a response to the disobeying of Chiang Kai-shek's orders to march to the front and give battle by three Nationalist generals; Pai Chung-hsi, commander of the Hankow Garrison holding the Yangtze River West of Nanking, Chang Chen, provincial commander of Hunan's Provincial Army whose troops were the only military force between the capital and the Communists to the north, and Chang Chien, commander of Changsha south of Hankow. The three commanders had attempted to force Chiang's resignation by sending telegrams asking Chiang to take a \\"vacation\\" instead of giving battle to the Communists. Fang's action, which was made to stall for time, did little to hinder the opening of a new front in Anhwei by the Communists on 5 January, but it presented the quite accurate image of an increasingly desperate situation faced by the Nationalists. The situation was used as the background for Washington lobbyist William C. Bullitt who petitioned the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs for a military intervention. Around this time, Chiang realized that the relocation or retreat of the entire army to Taiwan to regroup for a counterattack was not the ideal strategic move. Noting the sizeable amount of former Japanese soldiers demobilized from the Japanese surrender still present in China under Nationalist control, Chiang also tasked Fang and a group of Kuomintang members with Japanese backgrounds, including Cao Shicheng, to look into the creation of a joint Sino-Japanese military force to hold the fledgling Eastern Coast of China against the Communists. A letter was delivered by Cao to former commander of the Japanese Imperial Army in China and the Japanese Chief of the KMT's Central Liaison Office to Deal With Remaining Soldiers since December 1945, Yasuji Okamura, informing him of the dire situation facing the Nationalist army and requesting that he order deactivated elements of the Japanese Imperial Army into Chiang's service as part of a Sino-Japanese army group. Okamura was actually convicted of war crimes in November 1948 at the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal and then immediately protected by Chiang who took the general as an advisor. The Republic of China found Okamura not guilty in 1949 and returned him to Japan. In any event, these actions were too late to make any difference in the campaign. By April 1949, the Nationalist army was in full retreat and the Communist forces were advancing on Shanghai. Earlier in the year, Fang had been made Secretary General of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison General Headquarters and was tasked outwardly with coordinating the retreat and relocation of personnel to Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Nationalist government did not allow most of the local population of the city to flee until the last possible moment for propaganda and psychological reasons resulting in a chaotic and disorganized retreat and a failure to effectively evacuate the city's wealth resulting not only in a devastating loss of people, property and financial assets. The excessive troop commitment to Shanghai's defense, which was a strategically unimportant city and only of political value, would go on to seriously hinder the fledgling Nationalist war effort. The KMT blunder at Shanghai, resulted in the further bleeding thin of its forces, and facilitated an easier campaign for the Communist victories at Ningbo, Wenzhou and Canton Province. At 11:00 am on 24 May 1949, Fang gathered the foreign press at the Broadway Mansions where he announced the Nationalist plans to hold the city: On 25 May 1949, Fang Chi was forced to flee the city with the retreating Nationalist army together with Lei Chen, Ku Chen-kang, Chou Tse-jou and probably Tang Enbo, the last officials out of the city. Shanghai fell to the CCP two days later on 27 May with approximately three fourths of the KMT defense forces killed or captured. Ironically, Fang's media statements threatening house to house fighting similar to the Battle of Stalingrad turned out to be disinformation as almost none of the fighting in the Battle of Shanghai took place inside the city. Some 153,000 Nationalist casualties were recorded which included the complete loss of the KMT 37th Army, the KMT 51st Army and 5 Traffic Police Divisions. Most of the survivors retreated to Taiwan via Guangzhou. In May, Fang was installed as Secretary-General, KMT Chairman and Acting Governor of Fukien Province at Foochow.  Fukien Province and Retreat to Taiwan  Communist troops in Foochow after seizing Fukien Province in November 1949. By Mid-August 1949, the strategic situation for the Nationalists in Fukien was increasingly focused on having the retreat be as organized as possible. Focus had shifted entirely from engaging the Communists militarily to rearguard actions and the defense of Kinmen and Xiamen islands. On 15 August, this strategy was made public by the Kuomintang's Central Planning board who tasked Fang, Tang Enbo, and Lei Chen in the organization of the defense of the two Fukien islands. Mainland Fukien fell to the Communists in around November 1949 but many of its outlying islands including Quemoy (Kinmen) were successfully defended and the Republic of China retains control of them to this day. The defense of Kinmen specifically was extremely successful. The plan, allegedly formulated with the assistance of former Imperial Japanese Army planners, consisted of allowing PLA forces to land on the island en masse, to cut off their retreat and supplies by gaining control of the sea and then to wipe out the remaining ground forces. Pacification of the Mainland province by the Communist victors was not completed until February 1951. As a result of the fall of Mainland Fukien, the CCP set up Fujian Province with its capital at Fuzhou. The KMT, who retreated mainly to Taiwan, retained the province as Fukien Province and moved its capital from Foochow to Jingchen. The Battle of Guningtou proved to be the decisive battle that halted the Communist advance on many of the coastal islands still under KMT control, however many of these islands were later abandoned by the KMT or taken by force by the Communists during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. Later in 1949, Fang Chih was made Secretary-General of the newly founded Free China Relief Association, an organization that outwardly aimed to assist Chinese diaspora refugees displaced by the war and those still on the Mainland through relief aid. The organization was chaired by Ku Cheng-kang and its directors included Soong Mei-ling, Chen Cheng and Hu Shih amongst others. In around 1954, the organization came under the umbrella of the Asian People's Anti- Communist League (APACL), a group founded jointly by Chiang Kai-shek of the ROC, Syngman Rhee of the ROK, and Elpidio Quirino of the Philippines. Ku Cheng-kang, Fang's partner at the FCRA would go on to head the APACL in Taipei and the two would continue this collaboration for the rest of their lives. In 1954, Fang Chih was involved in relief and publicity activities during the islands campaign in the final stages of the Chinese Civil War.  Korean War  PVA soldiers captured by US Marines during the Battle of Hoengsong During the Korean War, Fang made several trips to the Korean peninsula where the KMT military was heavily involved in ground operations. Fang was in charge of an operation which saw the repatriation of Chinese \\"Volunteer\\" P.O.W.s to Taiwan as opposed to returning them to Mainland China. After the ceasefire which ended main phase of the Korean War , U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who negotiated the ceasefire himself, placed a provision in the agreement that Chinese prisoners of war would be allowed to choose where they would be repatriated. Contemporary Communist news sources attribute this decision to Fang Chih's \\"deception\\". Of around 21,000 PVA prisoners, about 14,300 or two thirds of these prisoners held by the allies were sent to Taiwan after the war due to the voluntary repatriation program. The day of the prisoners return to Taiwan is now recognized as World Freedom Day in Taiwan and South Korea. The experiences of Chinese POWs during the Korean War have been fictionalized in Jin Xuefei's 2004 book War Trash. Fang's role in the solicitation of mainland defectors or Anti-Communist Martyrs as they were known in Taiwan, expanded greatly during the Korean War and he later ran a program that rewarded mainland Chinese pilots with gold and other incentives if they defected to Taiwan with their warplanes.  Golden Triangle  CAT C-46D in Indochina with ROC markings. Following the defeat of the KMT in the Chinese Civil War, most of the Nationalist forces had retreated to Taiwan, however a significant portion of the Western army, which became known collectively as the Kuomintang 93rd Division, retreated from Yunnan Province into Burma and Thailand. Forces of the 15,000 strong KMT 13th Army under Li Mi established himself in Burma, nearly creating a Shan State and attempted to invade Yunnan Province no less than seven times. The 3,000 strong KMT 3rd Army under General Ly Wen-huan established themselves in Tang Ngop, Chiang Mai Province and the 4,000 strong KMT 5th Army under General Tuan Shi-wen established themselves in Mae Salong, Chiang Rai Province. From around 1949, Fang became heavily involved in anti- communist activities in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Burma and throughout Southeast Asia. In late July and early August 1959, Fang was involved in FCRA operations in Laos, officially to help a group of around 8,000 displaced Chinese who had entered Laos as a result of political persecution in the mainland. On 4 August 1959, Fang reported that the group was drastically in need of supplies and had come from Yunnan Province. On 27 August 1959, Fang Chi attended the foundation of the Sino-Laotian Friendship Society of which he was a trustee together with Ku Cheng-kang. The organization collaborated with the FCRA in an official capacity to bring relief aid to Chinese refugees in the Golden Triangle. The society also participated to an uncertain extent in operations with the Sananikone family's Veha Akhat and with the CAT though FCRA cooperation with the latter likely continued throughout the period. In January 1961, the Burmese military, in a secret alliance with the People's Liberation Army mounted a combined military operation against a major KMT base near the Mekong River. 5,000 Burmese troops and three divisions of the PLA attacked the fortified KMT base which was defended by an army of around 10,000 men. The operation was successful and the Burmese managed to defeat the KMT on 26 January though they retreated in good order. On 16 February 1961, a PB4Y-2 Privateer or a B-24 Liberator operating with the FCRA and carrying a payload of weaponry for the irregular troops who were retreating across the Mekong river into Laos and Thailand, was shot down by the Burmese Air Force resulting in a complaint being lodged at the United Nations. The aerial incident also involved the shooting down of a Burmese plane and the damaging of another suggesting that the mission could have been escorted by fighters. Fang accepted responsibility for the mission on behalf of the FCRA stating the private association's actions were completely separate from those of the Republic of China.  Refugees and Disaster Relief  disaster relief supplies to an official from the Ministry of National Defense for distribution to the Mainland after the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The area of operations of the Free China Relief Association was not restricted solely to the Golden Triangle. The organization was deeply embedded in pursuing the various overseas interests of the ROC throughout Asia and in the west. Fang was involved in refugee relief actions via the FCRA and the Chinese National Committee for World Refugee Year of which he was Secretary-General. Fang represented the Republic of China together with Li Ten-ping, the Assistant Secretary-General of the International Labor Bureau, before the UNHCR in Geneva, Switzerland. From 12 to 26 January 1960, the council met in Geneva, Switzerland where the executive committee, chaired by Dr. Elfan Rees discussed the year's agenda. At the conference, Fang outlined his objectives to deliver aid to refugees from Tibet together with John McCarthy, Director of the Department of Immigration at the National Catholic Welfare Council. Fang also outlined goals of assisting Chinese refugees in Hong Kong. In May 1960, his committee was responsible for raising around US$10 million for Chinese refugees in Hong Kong where the FCRA had established an office since 1950 working closely with the Rennie's Mill Camp Refugees Relief Committee. Some of the money was funneled to KMT organizations in the area of Tiu Keng Leng or Rennie's Mill, known for some time as Little Taiwan, which was a major support base for the Taiwanese cause until 1996 when the Hong Kong Government cleared the land for redevelopment with an eye on the upcoming transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. Attempts to evacuate ex soldiers living in the Rennie's Mill area of Hong Kong by the FCRA largely slowed or stopped in around 1980 when the duties of care and refugee relief in British Hong Kong were transferred from the Free China Relief Association to the Red Cross Society of China, after which no figures on evacuations to Taiwan were published. Following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, the ROC mobilized the FCRA to organize disaster relief operations in the areas of Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan. The FCRA collaborated with the Bank of Taiwan to provide a large quantity of donated humanitarian aid and food items from the people of Taiwan and organized bulk shipments via the International Red Cross to be distributed in the mainland. Beijing refused the aid shipments and the FCRA decided to launch the aid parcels directly to the mainland using unmanned balloons in collaboration with the Ministry of National Defense. These actions apparently triggered the scrambling of MiG interceptors tasked with shooting down the balloons. ROC Ambassador to the U.S. James Shen confirmed ROC actions to provide mainland disaster relief: Taiwan's furious response to the mainland's refusal to accept the aid was a powerful piece of political drama at the time, serving its interests at home and abroad.  Ryukyu  Portrait of the University of the Ryukyus from the 1960s. Fang Chih meets with Dwight Eisenhower during the latter's trip to Kadena Air Force Base, 19 June 1960. In 1958, Fang Chih founded and became the president of the Sino-Ryukyuan Cultural and Economic Association, an organization dedicated to maintaining cultural and economic dialogue between the people of Taiwan and Ryukyu-Okinawa. Following the Japanese surrender at the end of World War Two, the island of Okinawa was administered directly by the U.S. occupation forces from 1950 until May 1972 when the island was turned over to the Japanese government. The severance of official diplomatic relations between Japan and the Republic of China in September 1972 forced the association to effectively become the de facto embassy of the Republic of China in Okinawa. Fang's position at the Association demonstrated the importance the Republic of China placed on Okinawa / Ryukyu which hosted the largest U.S. military presence in the region. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War saw a dramatic increase in the strategic importance of the islands. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, the USFJ have maintained this large military presence. A contemporary US Civil Administration report from 1965 described Fang as follows: The office continues in its function under the same name despite politically motivated attempts in 2006 to rename the office under the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office system. In October 1985, Fang Chih convened the first Taipei-Naha Symposium which occurs annually alternating between Tokyo and Naha. The meetings were inaugurated after Professor Katsutaro Shimajiri (jp: Â≥∂Â∞ªÂãùÂ§™ÈÉé) of Okinawa University visited Taiwan in October 1983 for the purpose of a cultural exchange.  Taiwan  Following the retreat to Taiwan, Fang was consistently involved in anti-Mainland propaganda until the time of his death. From March 29 to April 9, 1969, Fang attended the Kuomintang's 10th National Congress in Taipei. In 1984, Fang wrote a column for Hong Kong magazine Cheng Ming where he attacked Mainland Chinese media censorship. In 1988, Fang was appointed the Vice-President of the Free China Relief Association. Fang served together with Ku Cheng-kang who acted as president and C.C. Chen who served as its Secretary General.  Marriage and descendants  Fang Chih married Masue Ueki (Fang I-chih, ), a Japanese woman, fellow Kuomintang member and classmate at the Tokyo Imperial University studying dentistry on 14 July 1925. The couple, both of whom grew up in only child households, had 11 children, three boys and eight girls. By Masue Ueki: * Fang Guangqi (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁê™) * Fang Guanglong (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÈæç) * Fang Guanghu (zh: ÊñπÂÖâËôé) * Fang Guangying (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁëõ) * Fang Guangmei (zh: ÊñπÂÖâ§ßû) * Fang Guangpu (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁíû) * Fang Guangling (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁé≤) * Fang Guangluo (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁèû) * Fang Guangan (zh: ÊñπÂÖâ§¶≠) * Fang Guangxuan (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÁíá) * Fang Guangyu (zh: ÊñπÂÖâÂ∂º) Three of his children, Fang Guanglong, Fang Guanghu and Fang Guangfu became notable Taiwanese scientists.

She was an active member of the revolutionary group Inghinidhe na h√âireann (Daughters of Ireland) and wrote articles for its newspaper, Bean na h-√âireann, and for Arthur Griffith's newspaper Sinn F√©in. Early life Gifford Household 1911 Census Form Gifford was born on 3 August 1889, the youngest of 12 children of Frederick and Isabella Gifford.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000143096/ Isabella Gifford, n√©e Burton, was a niece of the artist Frederic William Burton, and was raised with her siblings in his household after the death of her father, Robert Nathaniel Burton, a rector, during the Famine. Gifford's parents‚Äîher father was Catholic and her mother Anglican‚Äîwere married in St George's, a Church of Ireland church on the north side of Dublin city, on 27 April 1872.http://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details/37cc830541470 She grew up in Rathmines, Dublin. She was raised as a Protestant, as were her siblings. Like her sisters, the socialist Nellie Gifford, Grace Gifford, who married Joseph Plunkett and Muriel Gifford who married Thomas MacDonagh, she became interested and involved in the suffrage movement and the burgeoning Irish revolution. Education Gifford was educated in Alexandra College in Earlsfort Terrace. After leaving school she studied music at the Leinster House School of Music. It was her music teacher, in her teens, who first gave her her first national Irish newspaper \\"The Leader\\". She began reading this secretly and then started reading Arthur Griffith's newspaper Sinn F√©in.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0909.pdf#page=1 Career  Gifford was a member of Inghinidhe na h√âireann, a women's political organisation active from the 1900s. It was founded by Maud Gonne and a group of working-class and middle-class women to promote Irish culture and help to alleviate the shocking poverty of Dublin and other cities at a time when Dublin's slums were unfavourably compared with Calcutta's. Gifford, who was already writing under the name \\"John Brennan\\" for Sinn F√©in, was asked to write for its newspaper Bean na h-√âireann. Her articles varied from those highlighting poor treatment of women in the workplace to fashion and gardening columns, some written under the pseudonym Sorcha N√≠ hAnl√∫an. She also worked, along with her sisters, in Maud Gonne's and Constance Markievicz's dinner system in St Audoen's Church, providing good solid dinners for children in three Dublin schools ‚Äì poor Dublin schoolchildren then often arrived to school without breakfast, went without a meal for the day, and if their father had been given his dinner when they arrived home, might not eat or might only have a crust of bread that night. In 1911 she was elected (as John Brennan) to the executive of the political group Sinn F√©in. Gifford was a member of Cumann na mBan (The Irish Women's Council) from its foundation in Dublin on 2 April 1914. Its members learned first aid, drilling and signalling and rifle shooting, and served as an unofficial messenger and backup service for the Irish Volunteers. During the fight for Irish Independence the women carried messages, stored and delivered guns and ran safe houses where men on the run could eat, sleep and pick up supplies. United States In 1914 Gifford moved to America to work as a journalist. Through her connection with Padraic Colum and Mary Colum, whom she had met through her brother-in-law Thomas MacDonagh, she met influential Irish-Americans such as Thomas Addis Emmet and Irish exiles like John Devoy, and married a Hungarian lawyer, Arpad Czira, a former prisoner of war who was said to have escaped and fled to America. Their son Finian was born in 1922. She wrote both for traditional American newspapers and for Devoy's Gaelic American newspaper. She and her sister Nellie Gifford founded the American branch of Cumann na mBan, and she acted as its secretary. Both sisters toured and spoke about the Easter Rising and those involved. She was an active campaigner for Irish freedom and against the United States joining the war against Germany, seen as a war for profit and expansion of the British Empire, and so to the disadvantage of the work for Irish independence. She helped Nora Connolly O'Brien to contact German diplomats in the US. Civil War In 1922 Czira returned to Ireland with her son. As a member of the Women's Prisoners' Defence League she was an activist against the ill- treatment of Republican prisoners during the Civil War. She continued to work as a journalist, though she was stymied in her work, as were the women of her family and many of those who had taken the anti-Free State side. In the 1950s her memoirs were published in The Irish Times, and she moved into work as a broadcaster and produced a series of historical programmes. Czira died in Dublin on 15 September 1974 and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Together with Suske en Wiske and De Rode Ridder it was once one of his most popular and best-selling series, with successful translations in Dutch, French, German and Swedish. It was terminated in 1997. Concept Inspired by the success of Lassie, Willy Vandersteen and Karel Verschuere decided to make a comic strip series about a female collie. Contrary to the original Lassie series, though, it did not feature any child characters and was set in the Wild West rather than the present time. Bessy was given an owner, Andy Cayoon, with whom she had many adventures involving cowboys and Native Americans. Publication history \\"Bessy\\" was first published in the French-language Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique on December 24, 1952, and translated into Dutch a year later, when the comics were published in De Standaard and De Katholieke Illustratie. The series were also a tremendous success in Germany, where they were published in the youth magazines Pony and Felix. So much in fact, that Vandersteen's studio had a separate team drawing new titles, many of which were never translated in Dutch. With 992 different titles, reissues included, \\"Bessy\\" has the most album titles of all of Vandersteen's series. 164 albums of these were Dutch, 151 were French. The series was also published in Sweden under the name Bessie, which spawned 92 albums. The high production unfortunately also had an effect on the quality of the stories and drawings. As a result, the German editions were discontinued by 1985. One of Vandersteen's assistants, Jeff Broeckx, then created a reboot \\"Bessy Natuurkommando\\" (\\"Bessy Nature Commando\\") (1984-1992), where Andy and Bessy were reimagined as present-day conservators of animals and nature. Andy received a love interest, Aneka, and a little street boy named Kid, who travelled along with them on their missions. The scripts were written by Marck Meul. Twenty-three albums were drawn before the series was terminated in 1992. Broeckx tried a new reboot and redrew the first seven stories of the original series, as well as the twelfth story from the first series. By 1997 the series came to a definite halt.

Industry was ruined, housing was in short supply, and food was rationed. The population of Paris did not return to its 1936 level until 1946, and grew to 2,850,000 by 1954, including 135,000 immigrants, mostly from Algeria, Morocco, Italy and Spain. The exodus of middle-class Parisians to the suburbs continued. The population of the city declined during the 1960s and 1970s (2,753,000 in 1962, 2.3 million in 1972) before finally stabilizing in the 1980s (2,168,000 in 1982, 2,152,000 in 1992).Combeau, Yvan, ‚Äò‚ÄôHistoire de Paris‚Äô‚Äô (2013), pp. 107-108 In the 1950s and 1960s, the city underwent a massive reconstruction, with the addition of new highways, skyscrapers, and thousands of new apartment blocks. Beginning in the 1970s, French Presidents took a personal interest leaving a legacy of new museums and buildings: President Fran√ßois Mitterrand had the most ambitious program of any President since Napoleon III. His Grands Travaux included the Arab World Institute (Institut du monde arabe), a new national library called the Biblioth√®que Fran√ßois Mitterrand; a new opera house, the Op√©ra Bastille, a new Ministry of Finance, Minist√®re de l'√âconomie et des Finances, in Bercy. The Grande Arche in La D√©fense and the Grand Louvre, with the addition of the glass pyramid by I. M. Pei in the Cour Napol√©on.Dictionnaire historique de Paris (2013), Le Livre de Poche, pp. 308-309 In the post-war era, Paris experienced its largest development since the end of the Belle √âpoque in 1914. The suburbs began to expand considerably, with the construction of large social estates known as cit√©s and the beginning of La D√©fense, the business district. A comprehensive express subway network, the R√©seau Express R√©gional (RER), was built to complement the M√©tro and serve the distant suburbs. A network of roads was developed in the suburbs centered on the P√©riph√©rique expressway encircling the city, which was completed in 1973. In May 1968, a student uprising in Paris led to major changes in the educational system, and the breakup of the University of Paris into separate campuses. Paris had not had an elected Mayor since the French Revolution. Napoleon Bonaparte and his successors had personally chosen the Prefect to run the city. Under President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, the law was changed on December 31, 1975. The first mayoral election in 1977 was won by Jacques Chirac, the former Prime Minister. Chirac served as Mayor of Paris for eighteen years, until 1995, when he was elected President of the Republic. He was succeeded by another candidate of the right, Jean Tib√©ri. Paris during the Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì1958) Recovering from the war. Paris automobile show in 1946. The first municipal elections in Paris (and in France) since the war had been held on April 29 and May 13, 1945; they were also the first French elections in which women could vote. Six parties had taken part. The Communists had won 37 percent of the vote and 27 council seats out of 90, making them the largest party in the city government. On October 21, 1945, the first parliamentary elections since the war took place, which were won by a coalition of communists and socialists. In 1946 the new government nationalized the private electric and gas utility companies, and closed a long-time Paris institution, the houses of prostitution (Loi Marthe Richard). The end of the war did not end the hardships of the Parisians. Rationing of bread continued until February 1948, and coffee, cooking oil, sugar and rice were rationed until May 1949. Many of the factories around the city had been bombed during the war, and were still in ruins. Some Paris institutions were quick to get back on their feet. On February 12, 1946, the first major fashion show after the war was organized by Christian Dior at 30 Avenue Montaigne. High fashion soon became an important French export industry and foreign currency earner. The automobile industry also came back to life, putting on a glittering show of new automobile models in 1946. In 1947, there were growing tensions in the government between the communists and their coalition partners, the socialists. On April 25, the communist trade unions began a strike at the Renault factory, one of the largest enterprises in the city. On May 5, the new socialist prime minister, Paul Ramadier, dismissed communist ministers from the government. The communists responded by organizing strikes and work stoppages of railroad and bank employees. In the meanwhile, the food shortage had gotten worse; the bread ration was reduced to two hundred grams per person, worse than during the German occupation. =The housing shortage= Public housing project in Seine-Saint-Denis, in the Paris suburbs Housing was a particularly daunting problem. The population of Paris grew by about 50,000 persons a year between 1946 and 1954, adding 379,000 residents. However, very little housing had been built in the past twenty-five years to house them. 35 percent of the apartment buildings had been built before 1871. 81 percent of the apartments did not have their own bathroom, and 55 percent did not have their own toilet. 100,000 housing units in the city had been declared unhealthy; 90,000 which had been declared uninhabitable were still occupied. Health was also a major problem, with 100,000 cases of tuberculosis in the city, killing hundreds of persons each year, particularly in the crowded apartment buildings and furnished lodging houses. The government tried to improve the lives of working-class Parisians by imposing strict rent controls, the monthly rent of a skilled metal worker came to about four percent of his monthly salary, regardless of inflation or the cost of living. The unintentional result was to stop new construction, create a black market in apartments, and reduce even further the number of available housing units, affecting particularly young Parisians. In 1953, half of young married couples were still living with their parents, and 15 percent were living in a single furnished room. In 1954, 20 percent of housing units still did not have running water, two thirds did not have a toilet in their unit, and three-quarters did not have their own bathtub or shower. In 1950, the government began a new large-scale project to construct apartment blocks for low-income Parisians, after 1950 called HLMs (habitations √† loyers mod√©r√©s, or residences with moderate rents), usually on the edges of the city or in the suburbs.Combeau, Yvan, ‚Äò‚ÄôHistoire de Paris‚Äô‚Äô (2013), pp. 106-107 In 1952, some 82,000 new housing units were built in France, but this only covered a fraction of the new homes needed in Paris. A new minister of lodging, Pierre Courant, was named in 1953, and he launched a much larger- scale program of construction. The new buildings were called LOGECOS, or Logements √©conomiques, and they were built largely in the Paris suburbs, where land was cheaper and more available. Prefabricated and mass-produced materials were used, greatly reducing the cost of construction. Money was also saved by building much larger numbers of apartments at the same time in the same location. In the suburban community of Sarcelles, a single project built in 1954 contained 13,000 housing units. These new buildings, to save money, were often far from markets or city centers, and had few facilities or access to public transportation. In the 1950s, they were occupied largely by French-born workers. In the 1960s and 1970s, they became the home of tens of thousands of immigrants. =Labor unrest= The political system of the Fourth Republic was highly unstable; the President of the Republic had little power, the National Assembly was divided into constantly-changing coalitions, and the Prime Ministers changed frequently. The government of Pierre Mend√®s France lasted seven and a half months, that of Edgar Faure for just four months. The longest government, that of Guy Mollet, lasted a year and seven months. The left-wing governments nationalized many of the major industries in and around Paris, including the utilities providing electricity and gas. In October 1947, the Paris municipal elections were won by the Rassemblement du peuple fran√ßais, a new center-right party led by Charles de Gaulle, with 52 seats on the council out of ninety. The Communists won twenty-five seats, the socialists won five. The communist trade unions responded to the new government by organizing strikes of metal workers, public employees, teachers, and railroad workers in an effort to bring down the government, and called a general strike for December 1. Railroad lines were sabotaged, and the army, navy, army and firemen were called in to keep electricity networks and the metro running. On December 9, the communists called off the strike, but labor unrest continued. A strike in December 1950 caused the cutoff of electricity, and the shutdown of the Paris Metro. =Paris, Indochina and Algeria= In the early 1950s, France was engaged in a highly unpopular war to hold on to its colony of Indochina; in seven years the war cost the lives of one hundred thousand French soldiers. The decisive defeat of the French army at Dien Bien Phu, on May 7, 1954, led the government of Mend√©s France to the end of the war and the division of Vietnam into two countries, and the beginning of a stream of Vietnamese immigrants to Paris. In the early 1950s, Algeria was a department of France, and the government was determined to keep it so. On May 1, 1951, the first demonstration of Algerians demanding independence took place in Paris, followed by a much larger demonstration on the Champs √âlys√©es on May 18, 1952. On July 14, violent confrontations took place between the police, Algerian independence demonstrators and their communist supporters. Seven persons were killed, and one hundred twenty-six injured. In November, 1954, Algerian independence movements began an armed uprising to break away from French rule. Prime Minister Mendes-France and his minister of the Interior, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, increased French troops in Algeria from 57,000 to 83,000 and arrested two thousand suspected nationalists. The war soon had consequences on the streets of Paris. Killings began of members of two rival Algerian factions, the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN), or National Liberation Front, and the Mouvement national alg√©rien (MNA); and large demonstrations against the government were jointly organized by the communists and Algerian nationalists. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco, both at the time protectorates of France, received independence, and in Sub-Saharan Africa the government began the process of preparing its colonies for independence. All of these events soon led to an increased migration to Paris. Three other events with long-term significance took place in Paris during the years of the Fourth Republic: on December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the Palais de Chaillot; on December 15, 1948, Zo√©, the first French nuclear reactor, designed by Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, was tested at located at Fort de Ch√¢tillon; and on August 1, 1954, a Paris ordnance banned the honking of automobile horns \\"except in case of danger.\\" The constant din of taxi horns in the center of Paris became just a memory.; Paris under de Gaulle (1958‚Äì1968) De Gaulle with Israeli President David Ben Gurion (1960) In May 1958, the government the Fourth Republic, hopelessly deadlocked by divisions over the War in Algeria and other issues, resigned. The President of the Republic, Ren√© Coty, invited Charles de Gaulle to form a new government and prepare a revised Constitution. Within three months, the new Constitution was drafted and put to a vote on September 28, 1958; it was approved by more than 80 percent of voters. and a new government was in place. The Fifth Republic was born on October 4, 1958. During the ten years that de Gaulle occupied the presidency, France and Paris experienced rapid economic growth, which was accompanied by the building of new office buildings and housing, and the rehabilitation of historic neighborhoods in the center of the city. De Gaulle's Minister of Culture, Andr√© Malraux, oversaw the reconstruction of the historic neighborhoods in the center, particularly Le Marais. In Le Marais and the other designated historic zones, the rehabilitation consisted of leaving the fa√ßade and walls intact, while rebuilding completely the interior of the building. The Malraux law also required that the fa√ßades of buildings be scrubbed clean of centuries of accumulated soot and dirt. The most visible improvement was the cleaning of the cathedral of Notre Dame, which in a few months turned from black to white. In other neighborhoods in the center of the city, the rehabilitation took a different form: residential buildings of the Haussmann era were transformed into offices. As the price of land doubled in the city center, middle class residents moved out to the suburbs. Dilapidated and crumbling residential buildings were torn down and replaced by office buildings. The population of the arrondissements in the city center markedly decreased. The neighborhood of the central market of Les Halles was also a target for renewal. The old market was too small and traffic around it too congested to serve the needs of the growing city. One of the historic pavilions was preserved and moved to a park outside the city, but the others were closed down and the site, after long debate, was eventually turned into a park and underground commercial space, the Forum des Halles. =The first towers= The Beaugrenelle project in the 15th arrondissement, started in the 1960s, created a wall of residential towers along the Seine. Until the 1960s there were no tall buildings in Paris to share the skyline with the Eiffel Tower, the tallest structure in the city; a strict height limit of thirty-five meters was in place. However, in October 1958, under the Fifth Republic, in order to permit the construction of more housing and office buildings, the rules began to change. A new urban plan for the city was adopted by the municipal council in 1959. Higher buildings were permitted, as long as they met both technical and aesthetic standards. The first new tower to be constructed was an apartment building, the Tour Croulebarbe, at 33 rue Croulebarbe in the 13th arrondissement. It was twenty- two stories, and sixty one meters high, and was completed in 1961. Between 1960 and 1975, about 160 new buildings higher than fifteen stories were constructed in Paris, more than half of them in the 13th and 15th arrondissements. Most of them were about one hundred meters high; several clusters of high-rises the work one developer, Michel Holley, who built the towers of Place d'Italie, Front de Seine, and Hauts de Belleville. New towers in the 13th arrondissement Two of the projects of residential towers were especially large; 29 hectares along the banks of the Seine at Beaugrenelle, and 87 hectares between Place de l'Italie and Tolbiac. Blocks of old buildings were torn town and replaced with residential towers. Between 1959 and 1968, the old Montparnasse railway station was demolished and rebuilt nearby, making a large parcel of land available for construction. The municipal council learned of the project only indirectly, through a message from the ministry in charge of construction projects. The first plan, proposed in 1957, was a new headquarters for Air France, a state-owned enterprise, in a tower 150 meters high. in 1959, the proposed height was increased to 170 meters. In 1965, to protect the views in the historic part of the city, the municipal council declared that the new building should be shorter, so it would not visible from the esplanade of Les Invalides. In 1967, the Prefect of Paris, representing the government of President de Gaulle, overruled the municipal council decision, raised the height to two hundred meters, to create more rentable office space. The new building, built between 1969 and 1972, was (and still is) the tallest building within the city limits. =The creation of La D√©fense= View of La D√©fense from the Arc de Triomphe in 1970, with the first towers The same view of La D√©fense from the Arc de Triomphe in 1999 The most important project of de Gaulle's government was the construction of a new business district at La D√©fense, just west of the city limits. The idea was to create a new business center, since there was no more room to build in the traditional business center, around the Opera; and also to extend the historic axis of the city, an imaginary east-west line which ran from the porte-Maillot at the eastern edge of the city to Place de la Bastille, to the Louvre, and through the Place de la Concorde along the Champs √âlys√©es to the Arc de Triomphe. It allowed the creation of a French version of Manhattan, without disturbing the skyline and architecture of the historic center of the city. The idea had been discussed and various proposals put forward as early as the 1930s, but did not begin to move ahead until 1957. A site of nine hundred hectares, between two cemeteries, between Paris and Nanterre, was chosen. he first company to move to the site was Elf Aquitaine, the largest French company; they had little choice, since they were owned by the French government. It was also decided to add residential buildings, since there was not yet a M√©tro line, and so that the regional train line was not overwhelmed with commuters. Some of the more daring components of the original plan were dropped because of public opposition or cost. A planned 250-meter-high skyscraper by the architect Zehrfuss was reduced in height. The famed modernist architect Le Corbusier was commissioned to design a huge cultural center near the Rond-point de La D√©fense, with a museum of 20th century art, a music conservatory, and the national school of architecture, but this component was never built. The Museum of 20th century art instead became a museum of 19th century art, and was installed in the former Gare d'Orsay train station. The project developed slowly; most of the towers did not go up until the 1970s, and formed a backdrop to the Arc de Triomphe. By 2000 more than a million square meters of office space was created at La D√©fense, more than in the old central business district around the Opera. =New Chinatowns= The building of the new residential towers coincided with the departure of the French from Indochina, and the beginning of a large-scale new immigration to Paris. A large number of Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese from Saigon moved into the new residential towers, and created what became the largest Chinatown within the city limits. A smaller Indochinese community, had been created between the wars around Place Maubert, but its growth was limited by the rapid rise in real estate prices. An even larger Indochinese migration settled in the newly created town of Marne-la-Vall√©e. After the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, the new town attracted a large migration of Vietnamese and Cambodians, making it the largest southeast Asian community in the Paris region. =The suburbs and the ZUPs= In the suburbs of Paris, the process of de-industrialization was already under way before de Gaulle. Under the Fourth Republic, enterprises had been required to get government approval for every new industrial building over 500 square meters, and to pay heavy charges to subsidize transportation and other services. The government also paid a subsidy for the demolition of old factory buildings. The rising price of land was a major factor in the move of industry out of the city and the suburbs to other regions. Between 1960 and 1966, 352,000 square meters of industrial buildings was destroyed a year, while only 295,000 square meters was built. By 1960, the industrial space of the Paris region represented only 10 percent of the national total. The construction of public housing projects in the suburbs of Paris accelerated and took on an even larger scale. The new projects, authorized by an August 1957 law, were called ZUPs, or Zones √† urbaniser en priorit√© (Zones for priority urbanization). Unlike the earlier projects, these buildings included shops, schools and other services for their residents. By 1969, a dozen ZUPs had been built in the zone within thirty kilometers of Paris; they included about a hundred buildings altogether, with 300,000 housing units, occupied by about 1,400,000 residents. A single ZUP at Pantin had 1,700 units. Quantity and speed were the principal requirements in their constructions. They were welcomed and appreciated by the families who moved into them in the 1960s, since they resolved the housing crisis, but were not so much appreciated by the immigrants who moved into them decades later. The building of new housing was combined with the construction of new highways. On April 12, 1960, the autoroute du Sud, a highway from Paris to the south of France, opened. =The Algerian War and terrorism in Paris= In the 1960s, Paris regularly became one of the battlegrounds of the Algerian War for independence from France. The two sides engaged were the FLN, or Algerian Front for National Liberation, and the OAS an armed terrorist group fighting to keep Algeria part of France. On January 6, the OAS set off a series of bombs at targets across the city. The FLN began a campaign of killing French policemen, targeting the Muslim policemen who had been hired to fight the wave of terrorism. Thirteen policemen were killed between August 29 and October 3. On October 5, the Paris municipality imposed a curfew on young Algerian men, advising them to be off the streets between 8:30 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. On October 17, to protest the curfew, the FLN and their ally, the French Communist Party, organized an demonstration of four columns converging in the center of the city. The police blocked the march and arrested six to seven thousand persons. Some of the demonstrators were trapped by the police on the Pont Saint-Michel, and a number jumped or were thrown off the bridge. The number of persons killed was never reliably established; estimates vary widely from between thirty and fifty dead to the Communist estimate of hundreds killed. (See Paris massacre of 1961.) On January 17, 1961, the OAS launched another terror campaign, exploding seventeen bombs in Paris. The FLN and Communists held another demonstration February 8. It was broken up by the police, and eight persons were killed, most of them crushed by the crowd trying to take sanctuary in the Charonne metro station. (see Charonne M√©tro Station massacre.) On August 22, 1961, the OAS targeted de Gaulle himself. As he was being driven from Paris to the military airport at Villacoublay, an OAS assassination squad of trained soldiers with machine guns was waiting at the traffic circle at Petit-Clamart, just outside the city. They opened fire on the General's car, shooting 150 rounds, of which fourteen struck the car. Thanks to the skilled driving of de Gaulle's chauffeur, and the poor marksmanship of the gunmen, Neither the General, his wife, nor the live chickens they were carrying in the trunk of car for the family kitchen, were harmed. The leader of the attack squad was arrested a month later, tried, and shot by a firing squad on March 11, 1963. =The 1968 uprising= Red flags on the Odeon Theatre, occupied by demonstrators (May 1968). Daniel Cohn-Bendit (1968) General de Gaulle at the German Embassy in Paris (Feb. 3, 1968) In May 1968, Paris was the scene of a student uprising and general strike which briefly paralyzed the city, and had a profound impact on French society. The events began on May 3, 1968, with a sit-in-demonstration by students at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris, demanding reforms in the university. In the afternoon The CRS riot police were summoned to clear the building. That evening, demonstrations began in the Latin quarter. The police cleared the street with tear gas and arrested six hundred demonstrators. The leaders, including a German-born Nanterre student, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, were quickly judged and sentenced to prison. At first the French Communist Party and the labor unions opposed the demonstrations; Georges Marchais, the lead of the Communist Party in France, called Cohn-Bendit \\"a German anarchist.' Student and non-student radical and anarchist groups organized a massive demonstration of twenty thousand persons on boulevard Saint-Michel, confronting the police. The demonstrators began to pull up cobblestones from the street and built barricades at rue Saint-Jacques, rue Le Goff, rue Claude- Bernard and rue gay-Lussac. Cars were overturned and added to the barricades, along with bicycles, benches, and anything else moveable, up to the first floor of the buildings along the street. By ten in the evening there were some sixty barricades in place. The CRS riot police waited until after two in the morning and then tried to clear the streets. The battle was fought with tear gas from the CRS and molotov cocktails from the demonstrators. By 5:30 am the streets were clear without fatalities, but 367 students had been injured and four students and ten policemen hospitalized in serious condition. President de Gaulle had gone to bed at ten in the evening and no one had awakened him; he learned of the events in the morning. The major labor unions and the socialist party decided to join forces with the student demonstrators. On May 13 nine hundred thousand students and workers marched against the government of President DeGaulle, led by the leader of the Socialist party, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, and the leader of the Communist Party, Waldeck Rochet, and the heads of the two largest unions, the CGT and CDFT. A demonstration of an estimated nine hundred thousand took place on May 13, The demonstration ended with a huge sit-in around the Eiffel Tower. The workers of the major enterprises in and around Paris, including Renault, Rh√¥ne-Poulenc, Snecma, went on strike, followed by the workers of the railroads, the metro, and the postal service. Demonstrators occupied the buildings of the university. President de Gaulle made a secret half-day visit to the commander of the French army in Germany, then returned to Paris. On May 25, Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, met with the unions at rue de Grenelle and proposed a series of measures, including wage increases and a reduction in working hours, to win over the unions. On the evening of May 27, the anti-government movements, including the trade unions, students, Maoists, anarchists, Communists and Socialists, held a large meeting at the Charl√©ty stadium, firmly rejecting Pompidou's proposal. On May 28, Fran√ßois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce that there was a \\"vacuum of power\\", and call for the formation of a provisional government, followed by a new Presidential election, in which he would be a candidate. President de Gaulle responded on May 29, making a radio address to the French people, declaring \\"I have a mandate from the people, and I will fulfill it.\\" He dissolved the National Assembly, and called for new elections, blamed the demonstrators for causing chaos and the communists for trying to overthrow the government. The speech was followed on May 30, 1968, by a huge counter-demonstration of over one million people on the Champs √âlys√©es supporting de Gaulle. Life in Paris gradually returned to normal; the last demonstrators were cleared from the university and barricades came down on June 11, and work resumed at the Renault factory at Billancourt on June 18. The national elections held on June 23 and June 28, were a triumph for de Gaulle; his party, the RPR, won 293 seats in the National Assembly out of 487, the first time a single party had an absolute majority in the French Parliament. The events of May 1968 had two immediate effects on Paris; the five faculties of the University of Paris, founded in the 12th century was broken up in November 1968 into thirteen independent campuses; and the streets around the university were no longer paved with cobblestones, which had been used so extensively in the building of barricades. President de Gaulle's triumph did not last long. In September, he proposed a major restructuring of the French regions, and a reduction of power of the French Senate, and put his plan to vote in a national referendum, promising to resign if it did not pass. All the opposition parties, and many within de Gaulle's own party, opposed the change. The referendum was held on April 27, 1969. and the \\"no\\" vote was fifty-three percent. De Gaulle, as he had promised, immediately resigned. New elections were held in June, and the Prime Minister, Georges Pompidou, was elected President, taking 58 percent of the vote in the second round. Paris under Pompidou (1969‚Äì1974) Traffic on the Quai des Tuilieries (1970) \\"Paris must adapt to the automobile\\", President Pompidou declared. In the 1960s the population of the city and the surrounding suburbs had grown to 8 million inhabitants, and 150,000 migrants were arriving each year, both from other regions of France and abroad. Automobiles, very few in number in the 1950s, having an automobile became a status symbol celebrated in the French cinema, and they become more and more common; yet the French state had built only 29 kilometers of highways; portions of the autoroutes to the west and south and to Sceaux. No highways came into the center of Paris. A district of Paris had been created in 1961, comprising the city and the suburbs, three departments and 1,305 communes. A regional transit system, the RER (Reseau express regional) to serve the suburbs had been begun in 1961, and the first line began to operate in 1969, but the planners had underestimated the number of passengers; the passengers coming by the RER to the Gare de Lyon and to Chatelet, the main stations connecting to the metro, jammed the metro stations and cars. To move the workers of the suburbs into the city more efficiently, the government proposed a new urban plan at the end of the 1960s. It called for the construction of twelve highways radiating out of Paris; raising the periphericboulevard around the city limits of Paris so that traffic moved more quickly; and constructing two new \\"peripheric\\"' ring highways, the A86 and A87, around the city. The new plan, developed between 1966 and 1969, called for the construction of eight new cities around Paris, each with a population of between 150,000 and 300,000 residents. They would be connected with Paris by highways running parallel with the Seine to the north and the south of the city. Five of the eight new cities were constructed between 1969 and 1973: √âvry, Cergy (1969), Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (1970); Marne-la-Vall√©e (1972), and Melun and S√©nart (1973). The new cities were expected to hold a total of five million persons within twenty years. The Pompidou Center, the city's major museum of modern art (1977), surprised Parisians by putting all its internal plumbing and infrastructure on the outside. The 1960s had also seen a gradual departure of industry from the Paris suburbs to just outside the Paris region, to Rouen, Le Mans, Orl√©ans, and Reims. As part of the program of decentralization, several prestigious educational institutions, including the √âcole Polytechnique, the HEC Paris business school, and the √âcole des ponts et chauss√©es were also moved from the center of the city out to the suburbs. Other measures were put into place to decentralize the economy, and to encourage businesses to move outside the Paris region, including a new tax on office space. Between 1962 and 1968, the number of employees in Paris, particularly industrial workers, declined by 1.2 percent, while it grew in other regions of France. During the Pompidou years, the shift of the Paris regional economy from industry to services accelerated. Between 1969 and 1973, the number of workers involved in production dropped from 52.7 percent to 49.9 percent, and those involved in services grew from 46.4 percent to 49.2 percent. Between 1971 and 1973, Paris industry, largely in the suburbs, lost 42,000 industrial jobs and gained 172,000 jobs. Pompidou was a scholar and a great admirer of modern art. He edited an anthology of French poetry, decorated his office at the Matignon with modern art. His apartment on the √éle-de-la-Cit√© was filled with 20th-century art. His major legacy was the Pompidou Centre at Beaubourg, opened in 1977 after his death, an ultramodern showcase of the contemporary arts, whose pipes, escalators ducts and other internal workings were exposed outside of the building. Paris under Giscard (1974‚Äì1981) Giscard began the conversation of the Gare d'Orsay railroad station into the Mus√©e d'Orsay Pompidou's successor, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, was elected President on May 19, 1974, narrowly defeating Fran√ßois Mitterrand with 50.81 percent of the vote. His style was very different from that of previous French Presidents; he eliminated the formal costume worn by earlier Presidents on ceremonial occasions, and wore an ordinary business suit instead, and he invited the public into the √âlys√©es Palace on the July 14, the national holiday. The environmental or green movement had arrived in Europe at the end of the 1960s and quickly became a political force in Paris; the Green Party competed for the first time in the Presidential elections of 1974. Giscard, an adroit politicians, quickly adopted pro-environment policies. He declared, \\"The era of concrete at any price is over.\\" He proposed an eighteen- point pro-environmental policy, taking positions against \\"the proliferation of towers\\" and the \\"excesses of the automobile.\\" He called for preservation of green space, less population density and giving priority to public transport and pedestrian streets. A number of tower and highway projects were downsized or cancelled. Rather than building new monuments, he suggested redesigning old buildings for new uses; his most visible and successful project was the conversation of the Gare d'Orsay railway station into the Mus√©e d'Orsay for art of the 19th century; it was opened in 1986 under President Mitterrand. He also launched a plan to transform the area of slaughterhouses at La Villette into a par a containing a new museum of science and technology, the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie (1986). He also observed that the ring of suburbs around the city had plenty of residential towers but few cultural institutions; he funded the creation of two hundred cultural centers and music conservatories in the suburbs. Giscard's most important political reform in Paris was the recreation of the office of Mayor, which had been abolished by Napoleon. Since that time, the Presidents of France had personally chosen the prefects who governed the city. the law was changed on December 31, 1975. The first mayoral election in 1977 was won by Jacques Chirac, the former Prime Minister. Chirac served as Mayor of Paris for eighteen years, until 1995, when he was elected President of the Republic. Giscard's misfortune was that his term in office coincided with a global economic crisis and serious downturn in the French economy, and the end of thirty years of rapid and uninterrupted economic growth known as the Trentes Glorieuse. The French economy had been growing by six percent a year between 1969 and 1973; growth dropped to three percent between 1973 and 1979. Unemployment grew by 1981 to nine percent, a record high. In 1981, after one term as President, Giscard was defeated by the socialist candidate, Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Paris under Mitterrand (1981‚Äì1995) On May 10, 1981, Fran√ßois Mitterrand became the first socialist leader of the Fifth Republic, defeating Giscard with 51.8 percent of the vote. The socialists and communists also swept the elections for the National Assembly in June in what became known as the Rose Vague or \\"Pink wave\\". He promised to \\"Change the life\\" of Parisians and the French population, included four communist ministers in his government, and began with a series of radical economic reforms. He nationalized many of the largest enterprises in France, including the largest five industrial groups, and forty major banks, as well as insurance companies. He raised the minimum wage and family benefits, added a fifth week of paid vacation, lowered the retirement age to 60, shortened the work week to 39 hours, added 150,000 employees to the public payroll, and created a new tax on those with large fortunes. In a move to decentralize the French government, he shifted a number of government responsibilities from the national government to the regions, including the new √éle-de-France region. The economic reforms did not have their intended effect; unemployment rose to two million by 1983, and high costs caused more industry to leave the Paris region. In Paris, the traditional fortress of left-wing parties, Mayor Jacques Chirac, from the right wing, was reelected Mayor in the municipal elections of March 1983. Mitterrand modified his economic policies, removed the communists from his government, and succeeded in winning re-election as President over jacques Chirac in Mitterrand's presidency is best remembered for his Grands Travaux, or \\"Great works\\" in Paris, a series of monumental cultural projects. He had fourteen years in power, enough time to complete more projects than any president since Napoleon III, and he sometimes personally selected the architects of his projects. His Grands Travaux included finishing the extension of the City of Sciences and Industry at La Villette, begun by Giscard (Mitterrand dedicated the G√©ode, the symbol of the park on June 6, 1985), the Mus√©e d'Orsay, begun by Giscard (1986); the Institut du Monde Arabe, by architect Jean Nouvel, finished in 1987; the Grand Louvre, including the glass pyramid designed by I. M. Pei (inaugurated 14 October 1988); the Grande Arche of La D√©fense (inaugurated July 1989); the Op√©ra Bastille, by architect Carlos Ott, opened on July 13, 1989, the day before the bicentennial of the French Revolution; and the new French National Library, now called the Biblioth√®que Fran√ßois Mitterrand, which Mitterrand personally dedicated on March 30, 1995, in his last official appearance before his death. He also constructed more new parks and fountains than any French head of state since Napoleon III, including the colorful Stravinsky Fountain next to the Centre Pompidou, Parc Andr√© Citro√´n (on the site of a former Citroen factory), and Parc de Bercy on the site of the former wholesale wine depot. Most of the new parks were located in the outer arrondissements of the city, which had less green space than the center.

On June 22, Jean Tiberi, the Deputy Mayor, was formally selected Mayor by the Municipal Council. Tiberi followed the urban policies begun by Chirac, but his term was disturbed by a prolonged investigation into the attribution of government-owned Paris apartments at low rents to activists of Chirac's political party. The last of Fran√ßois Mitterrand's grand projects, the four book-like towers of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Bercy, was opened in May, 1996. President Chirac's own grand project, the Mus√©e du quai Branly, a new museum of the arts of non- European cultures, was planned and land acquired. In 1996, Paris again became a battleground of a foreign conflict. This time the war between the Algerian government and the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria. On June 25, 1996, a bomb exploded at the RER train at the Saint-Michel station, killing seven persons and injuring eighty-four. Another bomb exploded on August 17 in a garbage can on Avenue de Friedland at corner with Place Charles de Gaulle-√âtoile, injuring seventeen people; a bombing on October 6 near the metro station Maison- Blanche, and a further bombing on October 17 of an RER train between Mus√©e d'Orsay and Saint-Michel stations injured twenty persons. In response, the French government began armed patrols by soldiers in train stations and other public places.Fierro, Alfred, Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris, p. 658. In the last years of the century, Paris was the scene of an epic tragedy: the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in an automobile accident in the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel on August 31, 1997. The tunnel became a pilgrimage site for thousands of visitors. The next year Parisians celebrated the victory of France at the 1998 FIFA World Cup at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. France defeated holders Brazil 3‚Äì0 in the final, with two goals from Zinedine Zidane and a stoppage time strike from Emmanuel Petit. The win gave France their first World Cup title. The Champs √âlys√©es was filled with tens of thousands of jubilant Parisians and visitors celebrating far into the night. The beginning of the new century at midnight between December 31, 1999, and January 1, 2000, saw a new sight on the Paris skyline: the Eiffel Tower was covered for the first time with sparkling lights. Demographics The population of Paris had fallen during the war, but grew back quickly afterwards, despite the shortage of housing; the city grew by about 50,000 persons a year between 1946 and 1952. The birthrate in France was extremely high during this period; 800,000 persons were born in France during 1946, and a similar number in 1947 and 1948. Those under 20 years of age numbered thirty percent of the French population in 1936; it grew to thirty-six percent by 1962. In the 1960s, the population remained relatively stable; the number of retired persons departing was matched by young persons arriving in Paris from other parts of France and abroad. Between 1968 and 1975, the number of new arrivals in the region dropped to 114,000, and between 1975 and 1982, the population of the region fell by 273,000. With the economic crisis in the 1970s, the birthrate on France fell; it dropped by 18 percent between 1972 and 1976. The population of the city of Paris continued to decline slowly through the rest of the 20th century, not increasing again until 2008. =Immigration= Large-scale immigration to France resumed after the War, particularly as the French economy began to grow and workers were needed. In 1962, immigrants were estimated to comprise eight percent of the population of Paris. The largest number were Italians, followed by immigrants from Spain and Poland, then Russians, Armenians and Germans. However, a wave of immigrants from the French colonies of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco soon outnumbered all the others. The first North African workers had arrived in Paris in 1894, to work beside Belgians and Italians in the construction of the Paris Metro. They were first recorded in the official Paris census of 1904. A much larger migration of about half a million men arrived during the First World War, some to fight in the Army (twenty-one regiments were formed, and some thirty thousand North African soldiers were killed), and others to work in the armaments factories, public transport, and construction, replacing French workers who had been drafted into the army. By the end of the war there were about 60,000 Algerians, 75,000 Moroccans and 15,000 Tunisians in Paris. In 1925 the French government created a new system for bringing in migrant workers, mostly from the Kabyle region of Algeria. They had work contracts for a limited period of time, came without families and traveled back and forth between Algeria and France. Workers had to show a work contract, a marriage certificate or that they had purchased a small business to remain in France. By 1938, due to government restrictions, the number of North African workers in Paris was estimated by the Prefecture at seventy thousand. When World War II began, about one hundred thousand North African soldiers were mobilized to fight for France; eighty thousand were taken prisoner, and five thousand were killed. Between 1943 and 1945, thousands of Algerian and other North African soldiers served in the Free French forces of General de Gaulle. Immediately after the war, immigration to France resumed; workers were needed to reconstruct the infrastructure destroyed in the War, and to get factories working again. In the early 1960s, as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia gained independence from France, about 100,000 workers from the Maghreb came each year under government-to-government agreements to work in Paris, usually staying for two or three years. Most came without families, and lived in crowded shantytowns, called Bidonvilles, outside the city; one of the largest was located between Paris and Nanterre, where the La D√©fense business district is located today. With the sharp downturn of the global and French economy in 1974, the program of bringing North African workers to France was halted; but the great majority of the North Africans already in France chose to stay, and, when they could, to bring their families to France. They were joined by thousands of immigrants from French colonies in sub-Saharan Africa when they gained their independence. Between 1975 and 1990, the number of immigrants living in the Paris region increased from 13.5 percent of the population to 16 percent. The economy The gateway of the Renault Factory in Boulogne- Billancourt, once among the largest factories in the Paris region, closed in 1992 The war had ruined the engines of the Paris economy; the factories, train stations and railroad yards around the city had been bombed by the Allies, there was little coal for heat, electricity was sporadic at best. Nonetheless, the reconstruction went ahead rapidly, aided by 2.6 billion dollars in grants and loans from the United States given under the Marshall Plan between 1948 and 1953, administered locally from the Hotel Talleyrand on the Place de la Concorde, which allowed France to finance two-thirds of its exterior debt and to buy new machinery for its factories. Even before the war ended, the government had begun nationalizing much of the Paris industry; between 1944 and 1946 it nationalized the Renault factory, the coal mines and oil companies, Air France, and all the major banks and insurance companies. An important part of the planning of the new economy was conducted by Jean Monnet between 1946 and 1951; Monnet used the lessons learned to create the European Common Market. By 1948, French industrial production had come back to its prewar level. The 1950s were the beginning of the Trente Glorieuses, almost thirty years of rapid and steady growth. Between 1951 and 1968, the French economy grew at an average rate of 5 percent a year, reaching 6.5 percent between 1966 and 1968. The need for more workers led to increasing numbers of immigrants, coming mostly from North Africa on labor contracts. In the 1970s, the Trente Glorieuses came to an end. Under the pressure from trade unions, salaries and the cost of production grew quickly (7.1 percent in 1969, 6.3 percent in 1970, 8.5 percent in 1973), even faster than inflation (4 percent between 1960 and 1968); gradually, even with increases in productivity, goods made in France were more expensive than those made in Germany, Britain, the United States and Japan. French industry had difficult being competitive, even with modernization. The Citroen assembly line in Paris had closed in the 1970s. The Renault assembly line at Billancourt, one of the biggest factories in the Paris region, closed permanently in 1992. The rapid and unexpected increase in oil prices after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War also hit the French economy hard. In the early 1980s the cost of imports into France grew twice as quickly as the value of French exports. The Mitterrand government responded with a new wave of nationalizations of major French banks, industrial companies, and manufacturers including Thomson, Saint-Gobain, and Rh√¥ne- Poulenc. However, beginning 1986, the Mitterrand government decided to reverse course, and privatized most of the companies it had earlier taken over. Between 1983 and 1986, the unemployment rate passed 10 percent and the number of unemployed grew from 1.9 million to 2.5 million. Between 1988 and 1995, the Paris economy recovered some of its earlier growth; inflation was kept low, labor costs grew less quickly, but unemployment remained stubbornly high, particularly in the Paris suburbs. =Commerce and the department stores= Printemps department store in 1960 Before the War the grands magazine or department stores of Paris, including Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, Au Louvre, Au Bon March√©, the Bazar de l'H√¥tel de Ville (BHV), Magasins Dufayel and La Samaritaine, were the flagships of Paris commerce, serving Parisians and foreign visitors. However, after the war, they faced increasing competition, especially between 1970 and 1980, from big new hyper-march√©s or shopping malls in the Paris suburbs, from growing costs, and from the departure of the Parisian middle class to the suburbs. By 1995, only five; Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, BHV, Samaritaine and Bon March√©, were still in business, and they were catering increasingly to wealthy tourists. =High fashion and luxury goods= A gown designed by Christian Dior worn by Eva Per√≥n (1950) Dresses by Yves Saint-Laurent (1966) Paris since the Middle Ages was famous for the production and commerce of luxury goods, including jewelry, watches, leather goods, and perfumes. Haute couture, or high fashion, had been largely dominated by French designers since the 18th century. The number of fashion houses in Paris had risen to seventy-two who exhibited at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, then, after the Depression, dropped to thirty- nine at the Pavilion of Elegance of the 1937 Paris Exposition. After the war, Christian Dior was the first designer to organize a major fashion show on February 12, 1947. Several designers from before the War, including Coco Chanel (who had gone to Switzerland in 1945, then returned to Paris in 1954), Elsa Schiaparelli, Balenciaga, and Nina Ricci re-opened salons, and were joined by other new designers; besides Dior, they included Jacques Fath, Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Balmain, Pierre Cardin, Hubert de Givenchy, and Guy Laroche. The success of French designers, led by Dior, earned a significant amount of hard currency for the cash-strapped French economy. Coco Chanel branched out from clothing into perfume in the 1920s, inventing Chanel No. 5. In 1955, she branched out again with a new design of a handbag, which was soon imitated, in various forms, by other designers. By 1995, eighteen fashion houses in Paris had the resources to put on the necessary two major fashion shows a year: Carven, Dior, Chanel, Lapidus, Guy Laroche, Torrente, Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Nina Ricci, Leconanet Hemant, Ungaro, Jean-Louis Scherrer, Pierre Balmain, Yves Saint-Laurent, Paco Rabanne, Louis Feraud, Pierre Cardin and Hanae Mori. The dominance of Paris designers was lessened over the years by increased competition from other cities, particularly Milan, New York, and London. Paris fashion designers also did not adapt so readily as the Italians and other designers to the growing global market for ready-to-wear clothes. The 1980s saw the extraordinary and rapid consolidation of many Paris luxury companies into a few huge conglomerates. The biggest was LVMH. The company was formed by the 1987 merger of the fashion house Louis Vuitton with Mo√´t Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 mergers and acquisitions the champagne producer Mo√´t & Chandon and Hennessy, the cognac manufacturer. LVMH itself was largely owned by another Paris luxury goods group, Christian Dior, which purchased 40.9% of its shares, and 59.01% of its voting rights. Bernard Arnault, majority shareholder of Dior, is Chairman of both companies and CEO of LVMH. Another giant Paris luxury goods conglomerate created in the period was Kering (previously PPR), the owner of Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Brioni, Gucci, Puma, Volcom, and other luxury, sport & lifestyle brands. The company was founded in 1963 by businessman Fran√ßois Pinault and is now run by his son Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault. The third luxury goods giant of the period was the cosmetics company L'Or√©al, founded in 1909 by Eug√®ne Schueller, a young chemist who had developed a hair dye formula called Aur√©ale. In 1919, Schueller registered his company,Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-12. the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France), which eventually became L‚ÄôOr√©al In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the teams were 100 strong, and grew to the thousands of chemists by 1999; L'Or√©al was (and remains in 2015) the largest cosmetics company in the world. Art and culture =Cinema and the New Wave = Paris was the birthplace of the motion picture- the first projected motion picture showing, by the Lumi√®re brothers, took place in the basement of the Grand Caf√© in Paris in 1895, and Paris had long been the home of the French film industry. One of the most acclaimed French films, Les Enfants du Paradis had been made in Paris during the War, with food and film in short supply and under very difficult conditions, but was not shown until 1945. The major French film studios after the war were located in the Paris suburbs, in Neuilly, Saint-Maurice, Boulogne, and Boulogne-Billancourt, and they resumed production after the war and the studios at were greatly enlarged. In 1954 there were 354 movie theaters with 240,000 seats in Paris, including the great movie palaces built in the 1930s; the Art Deco Rex theater (1930) and the Gaumont Palace rebuilt in 1930, and sixty large movie theaters on the Champs-√âlys√©es, the Grand Boulevards from La Madeleine to La R√©publique, and around Place Clichy. But by the 1960s the French film industry found it increasingly difficult to compete with the growing popularity of television. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the large theaters were subdivided into smaller viewing spaces. By 1980 there were 119 movie theaters with 239 screens. By 1990 there were only about one hundred movie theaters remaining in the city, of which sixty-seven had multiple screens. The only remaining clusters of movie theaters were found along the Champs-√âlys√©es and on the Grands Boulevards, and in the Latin Quarter on the Left Bank. The studios also had to face the rising price of real estate in the Paris suburbs. Beginning in the 1960s, as more French films were made at locations outside the studios, one by one the old sound stages were torn down; the studios on rue de Silly in Boulogne was torn down in 1972 for real estate development, and the studio at Sant-Maurice was demolished at about the same time. In the 1980s, more modest and modern studios were built by the French Society of Production (SFP) at Bry-sur-Marne and by Studio 91 at Arpajon. The 1950s saw the emergence of a number of Paris-based actors, including G√©rard Philipe, Simone Signoret, Yves Montand, and Brigitte Bardot, whose films reached a global audience. The late 1950s saw the birth in the city of the Nouvelle Vague, or \\"New Wave\\" of cinema; led by a group of young directors who rejected the methods of Hollywood and who shared their ideas in a journal called the Cahiers du Cinema. The landmark films of the New Wave were The 400 Blows by Fran√ßois Truffaut (1959), Hiroshima mon amour by Alain Resnais (1959) and Breathless by Jean-Luc Godard (1960). Other prominent New Wave directors included Claude Chabrol, √âric Rohmer, and Jacques Rivette. Paris-based directors outside the New Wave who reached an international audience included Louis Malle and Roger Vadim. A new generation of actors came to the screen in the 1960s and 1970s, including Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon, Philippe Noiret, Lino Ventura, Catherine Deneuve and Romy Schneider, joined at the end of the period by G√©rard Depardieu, Isabelle Adjani, Juliette Binoche and Audrey Tautou. =Jazz clubs of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s= Jazz musician Sidney Bechet in 1947 Immediately after the war, the Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s neighborhood and the nearby Saint-Michel neighborhood became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly located in cellars, due to the shortage of any suitable space, and because the music at late hours was less likely to disturb the neighbors. The first to open in 1945 was the Caveau des Lorientais, near Boulevard Saint-Michel, which introduced Parisians to New Orleans jazz, played by clarinetist Claude Luter and his band. It closed shortly afterwards, but was soon followed by other cellars; Le Vieux-Columbier, the Rose Rouge, the Club Saint-Germain; and Le Tabou. The musical styles were be-bop and jazz, led by Sidney Bechet and trumpet player Boris Vian; Mezz Mezzrow, Andr√© Rewellotty, and guitarist Henri Salvador. The clubs attracted students from the nearby university, the Paris intellectual community, and celebrities from the Paris cultural world. They soon had doormen who controlled who was important or famous enough to be allowed inside into the cramped, smoke-filled cellars. A few of the musicians went on to celebrated careers; Sidney Bechet was the star of the first jazz festival held at the Salle Pleyel in 1949, and headlined at the Olympia music hall in 1955. The musicians were soon divided between those who played traditional New Orleans jazz, and those who wanted more modern varieties. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. =Cabarets and Music Halls= √âdith Piaf in 1962 Between 1945 and 1960 the cabarets and music halls played an important part in Paris culture, giving a stage to established stars and new talent. The most important music halls of the period were the Olympia Paris and Bobino, while the important cabarets included La Galerie 55, L'Echelle de Jacob, le Port de Salut, l'Ecluse and Trois Baudets. Future French stars who debuted in the cabarets after the war included Bourvil in 1946, Yves Montand in 1947, Juliette Gr√©co in 1948, Georges Brassens at the Trois Baudets in 1952, and Jacques Brel at the same club in 1953. Headliners at the Olympia included √âdith Piaf in 1949, Gilbert B√©caud in 1954, and Charles Aznavour, Tino Rossi and Dalida in 1955. The year 1958 saw the Paris debut of rock singer Johnny Hallyday, followed in 1959 by Eddy Mitchell. Paris singing stars in the 1980s and 1990s included Serge Lama, Serge Gainsbourg, Michel Berger, Yves Duteil, Francis Cabrel, Patrick Bruel, and Jean-Jacques Goldman. =Classical music= The most influential figure classical music in postwar Paris was Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992), organist at the Trinity Church beginning in 1930 and professor at the Paris Conservatory of Music from 1942. He was noted for his scientific study of bird songs (1958), his adaptions of traditional Asian and Latin American rhythms (1960); and original church music. Other notable composers included Pierre Schaeffer, founder of the school called music concr√©te and composer of Symphonie pour un home seul (1950) and Orph√©e 51 (1951); the composer Pierre Henry, a collaborator of Schaeffer, pioneer of electro-acoustic music; and composer of The Well-Tempered microphone; and the conductor and composer Pierre Boulez, a pioneer of serial music. =Literature and existentialism= Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre meet with Che Guevara (1960) The literary life of Paris after World War II was also centered in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s on the left bank, where there was a large concentration of book stores and publishing houses. Because most writers lived in tiny rooms or apartments, they gathered in caf√©s, most famously the Caf√© de Flore, the Brasserie Lipp and Les Deux Magots, where the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and writer Simone de Beauvoir held court. Sartre (1905-1980) was the most prominent figure of the period; he was a philosopher, the founder of the school of existentialism, but also a novelist, playwright, and theater director. He also was very involved in the Paris politics of the left; after the war he was a follower (though not a member) of the Communist Party, then broke with the communists after the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and became an admirer of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, then of Mao-tse Tung. In 1968 he joined the demonstrations against the government, standing on a barrel to address striking workers at the Renault factory in Billancourt. The legends of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s describe him a frequenting the jazz clubs of the neighborhood, but Sartre wrote that he rarely visited them, finding them too crowded, uncomfortable and loud. Simone de Beauvoir (1902‚Äì1986), the lifelong companion of Sartre, was another important literary figure, both as an early proponent of feminism and as an autobiographer and novelist. Other major literary figures in Paris during the period included Albert Camus (1913‚Äì1960), like Sartre a writer and novelist of the left but a vocal critic of Stalinism; Andr√© Maurois, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Andr√© Malraux and Marcel Pagnol. A new literary movement emerged in Paris in the 1950s, known as the Nouveau Roman, \\"the new novel\\", the \\"anti-novel\\", or \\"anti-romanticism.\\" Important new writers who emerged in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s included Alain Robbe- Grillet, Marguerite Duras, Nathalie Sarraute, Claude Mauriac, Michel Butor, Claude Simon, Henri Troyat, Maurice Druon, Marguerite Yourcenar, and Michel Tournier. Paris was also home for many notable international writers, including the African-American writers James Baldwin and Richard Wright, who found the city more welcoming than the U.S. in the early 1950s. =Theater= Beginning in 1947 Marcel Marceau re-invented pantomime at left-bank night clubs The theater world of Paris adapted successfully to the competition from motion pictures and then from television. The Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, the oldest theater in the city, continued to be the cathedral of French classical drama, though its actors also frequently appeared in French films. The number of theaters in the city actually increased over the course of the century from forty-three in 1905 to 118 in 1990, though a large part of the new theaters were very small. A generation of new playwrights and directors radically changed the content and style of Paris theater; prominent directors included Jean Vilar, who headed the Th√®√¢tre national popular from 1951 to 1963, and put on successful new productions of works by T. S. Eliot. Pirandello and Moli√®re; the actor-director Jean-Louis Barrault and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, who created the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault in 1947 and the Th√©√¢tre d'Orsay in 1974, produced French classics as well as innovative new works. The leading playwrights of the period were Eug√®ne Ionesco, born in Romania, who revolutionized Paris theater with his 1950 play The Bald Soprano (1950); Samuel Beckett, born in Ireland, who combined irony and burlesque in Waiting for Godot (1953); and Jean Genet, who had spent time in prison, who wrote provocative plays about sex, crime and prejudice. Other popular Paris playwrights included Jean Anouilh and Armand Salacrou. Marcel Marceau achieved worldwide fame by reinventing the art of pantomime beginning at clubs in the Latin Quarter in 1947, then in major theaters; he founded a school of mime in Paris in 1958. =Painting and sculpture= The Pont Neuf wrapped in plastic by Christo and Jeanne-Claude (1985) Following World War II, Paris lost its position as the most important art market in the world, passed by New York, and soon was challenged by London, Berlin, Tokyo and other cities. The Paris art auction house H√¥tel Drouot, founded under Napoleon and dominant before the war, slipped behind its London rivals, Sotheby's and Christie's. The most prominent artist in Paris, Pablo Picasso, departed for the south of France, where Henri Matisse had already moved. The cost of apartments and scarcity of ateliers made it harder for young artists to establish colonies in the city, as they had previously done in Montmartre and Montparnasse. Notable painters and sculptors in Paris included Jean Dubuffet; Victor Vasarely, a pioneer of Op Art; the sculptor Niki de Saint Phalle, famous for her colorful sculptural figures; Arman and C√©sar Baldaccini. In 1964, French cultural minister Andr√© Malraux invited Marc Chagall, who had fled Paris to escape the Nazis in 1941, to paint the ceiling of the Op√©ra Garnier. In August‚ÄìSeptember, 1985, after years of negotiation with the French government, the conceptual artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the Pont Neuf with 40,000 square meters of polyamide plastic. The bridge remained wrapped for two weeks. The first dedicated museum of modern art in Paris, the Mus√©e d'art moderne de la ville de Paris opened in June, 1947 in the old Palais de Tokyo of the 1937 Universal Exposition. The Centre Georges Pompidou, a project launched by President Georges Pompidou and dedicated to 20th century art, opened in 1977.

Mount House School was founded in 1881 by Miss Parker and Miss Tubbs at Alton House, Tavistock Hill, Plymouth. In 1890 the school moved location to North Hill, Plymouth (now the site of St Matthias church hall), moving in 1900 to larger premises at Mount House, Approach Road, Plymouth (the birthplace of Miss Tubbs). Plymouth was heavily bombed in World War II and the school re-located to 50 acre site at Mount Tavy in 1940. Mount House School became co-educational in 1996 with a Pre-prep established for 3-7 year olds ten years later. Co-curricular activities The school has a Combined Cadet Force, and runs the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.

Until 2015, C. donfaustoi was classified as part of another species, Chelonoidis porteri. Tortoise populations on Santa Cruz Island Earlier mitochondrial DNA studies of tortoises on Santa Cruz showed up to three genetically distinct lineages found in nonoverlapping population distributions around the regions of Cerro Monturra in the northwest, Cerro Fatal in the east, and La Reserva (or La Caseta) in the southwest. Although traditionally classified together, the lineages were all shown to be more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other, and thus are thought to be the result of three separate colonizations of the island. Cerro Monturra tortoises are most closely related to duncanensis tortoises from Pinz√≥n, Cerro Fatal to chathamensis from San Crist√≥bal, while Reserva tortoises are closer to the four southern races of Isabela. Tortoises are aided in oceanic dispersal by their ability to float with their heads up, and to survive up to six months without food or water. Classification In 2015, Chelonoidis donfaustoi was reclassified as a new species on the basis of genetic and morphological data. C. donfaustoi is the sister lineage to C. chathamensis on San Crist√≥bal, and is part of a clade that also includes C. hoodensis of Espa√±ola and C. abingdoni of Pinta. Genetically, C. donfaustoi differs from other tortoises by allele frequency at 12 microsatellite loci, which allowed assignment to the genetically distinct cluster. C. donfaustoi also shares a set of nucleotides distinct from that of C. porteri on the same Santa Cruz Island and from C. chathamensis. The reclassification reduced the range of C. porteri to the western and southwestern parts of Santa Cruz Island. At the same time it confined C. donfaustoi to the eastern part of Santa Cruz Island, with a population size estimated at about 250 individuals. C. porteri was shown to be part of a clade that includes the Floreana and southern Isabela tortoises, as well as specimens reputedly representing R√°bida and Fernandina. The species received the scientific epithet donfaustoi in honor of Fausto Llerena S√°nchez, who devoted 43 years to giant tortoise conservation as a park ranger within the Galapagos National Park Directorate. ‚ÄúDon Fausto‚Äù was the primary caretaker of endangered tortoises in captivity. C. donfaustoi is the 15th known tortoise species to be discovered on the islands, with four of those species being extinct. The classification of a new tortoise species was the first in over a century. Appearance While similar to other Gal√°pagos tortoises, C. donfaustoi can be distinguished from them by means of shell size and shape. Some Gal√°pagos tortoises are larger than C. donfaustoi, with higher anterior opening of the shell.

It contains an amnesty decree of the 21st Dynasty Theban High Priests of Amun Menkheperre. History The Banishment Stela was discovered in Luxor around 1860 by the then French Vice-Consul, Henri Maunier; it was carried to Paris in 1884 and exhibited at the Louvre where it still is.Sternberg-el Hotabi, Heike (1986). \\"Die Stele der Verbannten\\", in: Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments, II/1, pp. 112‚Äì7. The stela is made from diorite and measures in height and in width. The upper part is poorly preserved, and only a depiction of Menkheperre praying to the god Amun is still visible; the lower portion is in better condition and of the 23 lines of Egyptian hieroglyph text, only the first 4 are mostly lost. Content The stela mentions three dates, although it is not entirely clear what happened on them, or even to which reign(s) they belonged. These dates are (in the order in which they appear in the text, which is not necessarily their correct chronological order): *Date A: year 25, third month of the Season of the Harvest (= month 11), day 29 *Date B: year 25, first month of the Season of the Inundation (= month 1), day 4 or 5 *Date C: year ... , fourth month of the Season of the Harvest, epagomenal days, Birth of Isis According to Von Beckerath, with date C, for reasons of space, the regnal year could only have been relatively low. Acceptable solutions would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 or 20. The stela apparently reports that in the regnal Year 25 of an unknown pharaoh a revolt sparked in Thebes against the Priesthood of Amun. The revolt was suffocated in the same year, and the rebels were banished (date A) into the Kharga Oasis by decision of the oracle of Amun. Shortly after (date B) Menkheperre was installed as generalissimo and High Priest of Amun ‚Äúby the god Amun himself‚Äù; in the early reign of another king (date C), Menkheperre again resorted to the oracle and obtained the recall and pardon of the exiles, just before issuing the stela to celebrate this act. The king whose regnal Year 25 is reported on the stela (date A) could only have been the founder of the 21st Dynasty Smendes, who is generally assumed to have reigned for around 25‚Äì26 years. The king who was in charge when the stela was issued (date C) was one of his immediate successors, most likely the ephemeral and poorly known Amenemnisu, or alternatively but less likely, Psusennes I., ¬ß¬ß 213, 217‚Äì8 References Further reading  Category:Ancient Egyptian stelas Category:2nd-millennium BC steles Category:Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt Category:Egyptian antiquities of the Louvre Category:Decrees Category:11th-century BC works ","title":"Banishment Stela"},{"id":"48322982","text":"Scotaeus is a genus of darkling beetles (insects in the family Tenebrionidae).GBIF Species Species within this genus include:Biolib * Scotaeus corallipes Hope, 1834 * Scotaeus dentipennis Gebien, 1935 * Scotaeus focalis Gebien, 1935 * Scotaeus fruhstorferi Gebien, 1935 * Scotaeus seriatopunctatus Heller, 1898 * Scotaeus xestothorax Heller, 1899 References Category:Tenebrionidae genera ","title":"Scotaeus"},{"id":"48322994","text":"Commander Sir Ernest Dudley Gordon Colles (5 April 1889 ‚Äì 13 July 1976) was an Irish Royal Navy officer and courtier, who served in the Royal Households of George VI and Elizabeth II.

He served as President of both the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He served as Surgeon in Scotland to Queen Victoria. Life Maclagan was born in Edinburgh on 8 February 1785, the son of Robert MacClaggan (d.1785), surgeon, and Margaret Smeiton, his second wife. His father changed his name to Maclagan some time before David was born, to disassociate himself from various Jacobite connections. Maclagan trained as a doctor and surgeon at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MD in 1805. Too young to join the army as a surgeon, he travelled to London and studied and practiced at St George‚Äôs Hospital. He was admitted into the Royal College of Surgeons in 1807. From 1808 he served as a military surgeon with the 91st Regiment of Foot, serving during the Walcheren Campaign within the Napoleonic Wars. This action saw huge injuries, and Maclagan's experience would have increased exponentially from this experience. From 1810 to 1813 he served in various military campaigns, including the attack on Badajos during the Peninsular War, the Battle of Salamanca, the Battle of Vittoria, the Battle of the Pyrenees, the Battle of Nivelle and the Battle of Nive. On return to Britain he became a practicing surgeon in Edinburgh in 1815, partly working for the New Town Dispensary on Thistle Street, which he co-founded in that year. In 1823 he lost out to George Ballingall in the choice for the University of Edinburgh's chair in Military Surgery. He was Consultant surgeon/physician at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary from 1848 until retiral. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1828, his proposer was Sir John Robison. He died at home, 129 George Street,Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1850-1 in Edinburgh on 6 June 1865. He is buried in Dean Cemetery. The substantial grave lies against the north wall of the original cemetery (backing onto the northern extension). His wife and many of his children and grandchildren are buried with him.

Henry Chartres Biron Worship Street. \\"Spy\\", 1907. Sir Henry Chartres Biron (10 January 1863 - 28 January 1940) was a British barrister who was later chief magistrate of the Metropolitan Police Courts. He presided over the trial for obscenity of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian novel, The Well of Loneliness. Early life Henry Chartres Biron was born on 10 January 1863. His father was the barrister and police magistrate R.J. Biron Q.C. His mother was the sister of F.A. Inderwick K.C., the noted divorce lawyer. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, University of Cambridge.\\"Obituary Sir Chartres Biron\\", The Times, 29 January 1940, p. 9. Career Biron was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1886. He appeared at the Central Criminal Court, the London Sessions, the Metropolitan Police Courts, and on the South-Eastern Circuit. He was appointed prosecuting counsel for the Post Office and Treasury Counsel at the London Sessions. In 1903 he was junior counsel for the defence in the Arthur Alfred Lynch M.P. high treason trial in which the defendant was found guilty and sentenced to death but later pardoned. He practiced exclusively in crime until he became a London stipendiary magistrate in 1906. In the same year, he was an unsuccessful Liberal Party parliamentary candidate for Hythe. In 1920, he became chief magistrate of the Metropolitan Police Courts following the retirement of Sir John Dickinson,\\"New Metropolitan Chief Magistrate\\", The Times, 22 April 1920, p. 16. and received a knighthood as was customary on appointment to that position. In 1921, the early stages of the case of fraud by Horatio Bottomley M.P. were heard before Biron. Bottomley was subsequently jailed for seven years in a higher court. In 1927, Biron was a member of the Street Offences Committee. In 1928, Biron presided over the trial for obscenity at Bow Street Magistrates' Court of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian novel, The Well of Loneliness, ruling that the book was an \\"obscene libel\\" and that all copies should be destroyed. The book was not published again until 1949.Lesbian novel was 'danger to nation'. David Smith, The Guardian, 2 January 2005. Retrieved 22 October 2015. According to The Times, Biron's ruling was not based on the acts described in the book, which he said did not of themselves make the book obscene, but on the lack of condemnation of the acts and the behaviour of the characters. According to Biron, the book contained \\"not one word which suggested that anyone with the horrible tendencies described was in the least degree blameworthy. All the characters in the book were presented as attractive people and put forward with admiration\\".\\"Novel Condemned As Obscene\\", The Times, 17 November 1928, p. 5. Outside law Biron was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and an adventurous traveller. He loved literature, collected the sayings of Samuel Johnson in book form and as a young man wrote a parody of Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines as \\"Hyder Ragged\\", in 1887. He wrote many book reviews for the National and the London Mercury. His memoirs were published in 1926 as Without prejudice: Impressions of life and law. He was a member of Brooks's and the Garrick Club. Death Biron died at his home in London on 28 January 1940. He never married.

History Kuibyshev Aviation Institute(1942 ) Kuibyshev Aviation Institute (Kuai) formed in accordance with the order of the All-Union Committee on Higher Education in SNK for the military aviation industry designers in 1942. The first classes in the walls of the new institute started in October 1942. In 1957 Kuai began active development of space technology and the training of qualified specialists in this field. Employees of the Institute participated in the development of rocket, in particular, in the development of carrier rockets Soyuz, \\"Lightning\\" and \\"East\\" and \\"Peace\\" in preparation for space programs at the space station. C 1956 Institute of management was taken over by the Hero of Socialist Labor, Professor VP Lukach—ëva that helped the university to go to the national level. February 22, 1966 under the decree number 136 of the CC CPSU and the USSR Council of Ministers \\"On the perpetuation of the memory of Academician SP Korolev\\" Kuai was named after SP Korolev, and in the next year by the decree of the Supreme Soviet Presidium of the institute was awarded the Order Red Banner of Labor. After the departure of Professor VP Lukach—ëva in 1988, the new rector of Kuai was the future academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Pavlovich Shorin, but already in 1990 it was replaced by the new rector of Samara State Aerospace University Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Viktor Soifer. January 25, 1991 the town was renamed Kuibyshev in Samara, in its historical name, in connection with what has been renamed and the institution itself. He was named Samara Aviation Institute, but the September 23, 1992, he received university status and since then is its current name.‚Üë –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –°–ì–ê–£ –Ω–∞ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ In 2006, the Samara State Aerospace University took third place in the all-Russian contest of universities, introducing innovative educational programs held in the framework of the \\"Education\\" national project, putting on a competition of innovative educational program \\"Development of the center of competence and training of world-class experts in the field of aerospace and geoinformation technologies.\\" In 2009, the Samara State Aerospace University, along with other first 11 (from 39 in 2010) universities of the Russian Federation is the winner of the contest of national research universities.‚Üë –°–ü–ò–°–û–ö –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤, –≤ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–≤–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—è ¬´–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç¬ª –Ω–∞ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ In July 2013 the University became one of 15 winners of the university increase the competitiveness of the project competition 5-100,‚Üë –°–∞–π—Ç –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏ –†–§, 08.07.2013 the aim of which is to hit the Top 100 universities in the world ranking.

He killed a teaching assistant and a male student, stabbed another male student and a teacher, and died later of the gunshot wounds he received during his apprehension. The second teacher who was wounded died in hospital six weeks after the attack, on 3 December. It was Sweden's first deadly attack on a school since the 1961 Kung√§lv school shooting when one person was killed and six injured. It is also the deadliest attack on a school in Swedish history. The initial police investigation concluded that Pettersson was motivated by racism and had chosen the school as his target due to its location in a neighbourhood with a high immigrant population.  Background  The city of Trollh√§ttan has had a long history of hate crimes, starting with arson at a mosque in the 1990s. Anders Sundell has found it to be the most ethnically segregated city in Sweden. Although surveys by non-governmental organisations have frequently shown Sweden to be the European country which is most tolerant of immigration, its population is highly polarised on the issue. Sundell's research showed that consistently over the last 20 years, a plurality of Swedes have wanted to limit the number of refugees coming to the country, but \\"There is a large difference between what the politicians think and the general public, and the media have not questioned the politicians until recently.\\" As a consequence, Swedish anti- immigrant forces believe that there is a conspiracy opposing their views.  Attack  Pettersson entered the school in a German World War II helmet and a mask similar to either that of Star Wars villain Darth Vader or those worn by police in Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade. At first, eyewitnesses believed it was a Halloween prank. Pettersson immediately attacked 20-year-old teaching assistant Lavin Eskandar. Eskandar, a Feyli Kurd from Iraq, was stabbed and died at the scene. Pettersson then stabbed the abdomen of Ahmed Hassan, a 15-year-old born in Somalia. Hassan died in the hospital. After that, while wandering the halls, Pettersson posed with two students who thought he was playing a prank, and took a picture of Pettersson with blood dripping from his sword. Shortly after, when 42-year-old teacher Nazir Amso asked Pettersson to remove his mask, Amso was stabbed. He died due to his injuries six weeks later at the hospital on 3 December. At 10.16 am, Pettersson was shot by police. He died in the hospital. On the morning of 23 October, Swedish police and media confirmed that the motive behind the attack had \\"racist motives\\" and that it was a \\"hate crime\\". Niclas Hallgren, the city's police chief, stated that all of the victims were \\"dark-skinned\\". Head of investigation Thord Haraldsson said that CCTV footage showed that Pettersson spared the lives of students with white skin.  Perpetrator  Anton Niclas Lundin Pettersson (22 June 199422 October 2015) was identified as the attacker at 20:00 CET (18:00 GMT) by Expressen. According to Aftonbladet, the perpetrator had visited right-wing extremist groups at social media sites supporting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. He had also joined a group on Facebook that wants to stop immigration to Sweden. The Swedish Security Service were called in to investigate these findings. Pettersson had no criminal record and was not a member of any political organisation, but had supported a petition by the Sweden Democrats to initiate a referendum on immigration. He left a handwritten note at his home in which he declared that something had to be done about immigration, and that he did not expect to survive his spree. Pettersson lived in an apartment in the neighbourhood of Stavre, but chose to attack the Kronan School in Kronog√•rden, where there are more immigrants; police cited this as more evidence towards his motive. Former classmates described the perpetrator as a lonely person who \\"lived in his own world\\" and always dressed in black clothes influenced either by the emo or rock scene. Bj√∏rn Ihler, a survivor of Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik's terror attacks in 2011, wrote in The Guardian that in 2013, Pettersson had \\"liked\\" a YouTube video of former Ku Klux Klan leader Johnny Lee Clary testifying how a positive experience with a black man had caused him to disavow his previously-held beliefs.  Aftermath and reactions  Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven travelled to Trollh√§ttan after news of the attack, calling it a \\"black day\\" for the country. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman wrote on Twitter, \\"It is with sadness and dismay I received the news of the attack on the school in Trollh√§ttan. My thoughts go to the victims and their families\\". King Carl XVI Gustaf said that the royal family received the news \\"with great dismay and sadness\\". In the days following the attack, there were reports of people wearing suspicious outfits or brandishing weapons, which were discovered to be people celebrating Halloween. The police warned the public not to carry imitation weapons with their Halloween costumes, to avoid potentially dangerous misunderstandings. The school remained closed until 2 November, when it reopened with higher security. An Afghan father told The Local that he wished to leave the neighbourhood for his family's safety. On 29 September 2017, the first book about the school attack was published: Det som aldrig fick ske. The book contains completely new facts, for example a secret suicide note that the police and the Pettersson family did not know existed. In the book the brother of Anton Lundin Pettersson speaks out for the first time. The author, √Ösa Erlandsson, won the Stora Journalistpriset (the finest prize in journalism in Sweden) for the book. In 2019, the attacker behind the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, mentioned Pettersson in his manifesto and declared his support for him. The attack is found listed in a book on terrorism.

After winning the 2015 LMS Summer Playoffs, AHQ qualified for the 2015 World Championship, where they placed fifth to eighth after losing to SKT T1 in the quarterfinals.  League of Legends  = History =  Formation  In September 2012, after Corsair failed to travel to the Season 2 World Championship, AHQ was forced to merge with them and SSWIE before changing its name to \\"ahq eSports Club.\\" UDJ, ArTie, Prydz, and Mralbis from Corsair, along with GreenTea from SSWIE, composed the first lineup of AHQ.  2013  In 2013, team captain UDJ retired, and GarnetDevil joined. AHQ was invited to join the Garena Premier League (GPL)'s 2013 spring season to face teams such as the Taipei Assassins and the Singapore Sentinels. In March, westdoor and Lantyr both joined AHQ and became the team's main players. They finished the GPL spring season 2013 in third place. In GPL Summer 2013, the team improved from the previous year, beating the Taipei Assassins and the Singapore Sentinels and winning the season with a 24-4 record. They made it to the GPL Finals to face the winner of the Spring Season, the Taipei Assassins. At the same time, AHQ also joined TeSL and met the other strong team in Taiwan, the Taipei Snipers. AHQ finished TeSL in second place. The team beat TPA in the 2013 GPL Finals. At the Season 3 World Championship, they were beaten by the TeSL team Gamania Bears.  2014  After Season 3, AHQ acquired Naz from Wayi Spider while Lantyr moved to AHQ Fighter. AHQ won 20 matches and only lost one game in the 2014 LNL Winter. However, in 2014 GPL Winter, they lost to the Taipei Snipers and placed third. AHQ had a successful run in 2014 GPL Spring group stages, where they achieved a record of 9-1. In the playoffs, they dominated the Singapore Sentinels 3-0 in the quarterfinals before dispatching the Saigon Jokers 3-1 in the semifinals. In the finals, however, they lost to the Taipei Assassins 2-3 and ended playoffs in second place. 2014 GPL Summer, starting in June 2014, featured another successful run in the group stages by AHQ, when they achieved an 8-2 record. In the playoffs, they won 3-0 against the Bangkok Titans in the quarterfinals, and won 3-1 against Logitech G Fighter in the semifinals, mirroring their performance earlier in the year. (Full Louis got disqualified from GPL this season due to using players who were not 17 years of age, SofM, and Jeff. Logitech G Fighter replaced them with playing in the semifinals). Unfortunately, they went on to lose to the Taipei Assassins 0-3 in the finals, achieving another second place record in the playoffs. While they were unable to become the champions of 2014 GPL Summer, their dominating performance in the 2014 Garena Regional Finals (where they emerged as the number-one seed in the Taiwan and SEA region by beating the Saigon Fantastic Five in the finals) allowed them to participate in the 2014 Season World Championship. Seeded into Group A of the 2014 Season World Championship in Taiwan, the team played against EDward Gaming, Samsung White and Dark Passage. AHQ's 3-3 record qualified them for a tiebreaker into the bracket, where they lost to EDward Gaming.  2015  After a disappointing run in the 2014 Season World Championship, AHQ acquired Mountain and OhReaL from Logitech Snipers, Ziv from HK Attitude Mage, and MrAlbis from Logitech G Fighter. Naz and GarnetDevil left, while Prydz became the analyst. The new roster qualified for IEM Season IX - Taipei in IEM Season IX, where they won 2-0 against the Logitech Snipers, 2-0 against Hong Kong Esports, and 2-1 against the Yoe Flash Wolves in the winner's bracket finals. At IEM Season IX - Taipei, AHQ would receive a quarterfinal bye for winning the winner's bracket finals, but would then be defeated 0-2 against the Yoe Flash Wolves. Season 5 marked the start of the League of Legends Masters Series, a new league exclusive to teams from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. AHQ was invited to its qualifiers, where they went 3-0 in their group to earn a berth in the regular season. They finished fourth in the round robin, with a 13-8 record, but went on to win the playoffs with 3-0 victories over Hong Kong Esports and the Taipei Assassins, followed by a 3-1 finals victory over the Flash Wolves. Because of their spring split-victory, AHQ were invited to play at the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational. Finishing 3-2 in the group stage, AHQ advanced to the bracket, but were knocked out immediately by eventual tournament winners EDG. AHQ went on to sweep their way through the Summer Season, with a win-tie-loss record of 11-3-0. Placed directly into the finals of the gauntlet-style playoffs, they once again won the season, this time beating Hong Kong Esports 3-0 and automatically qualifying for the 2015 Season World Championship. At Worlds, AHQ were seeded into Group B, along with Fnatic, Invictus Gaming, and Cloud9. They went 3-3, advancing to the playoffs after a tiebreaker victory over Cloud9 (giving the North American team their fourth loss in a row that day).

July 2015 The didactic concept takes into account the so-called forgetting curve, or also known as \\"Ebbinghaus curve\\" named after the psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. The curve describes the high degree of forgetfulness in conventional, formal learning, where only a small part of information is actually moved and therefore saved into the long-term memory of the participants. The concept is based on the technique of micro learning, where information is divided into small units and the informal learning, which takes place on a day-to-day basis outside the formal educational systems.Gottfredson, Conrad: In: Learning Solutions Magazine: What we got here.... 19.

July 2015 EPSS and virtual assistants Advanced context- sensitive assistance programs like EPSS should not be confused with simple help applications that are usually keyword-triggered. An example for the latter is the well-known, but highly unpopular Clippy. This animated paperclip popped up whenever users typed a certain word or term in Microsoft Office. Clippy was often seen as annoying and removed by Microsoft in 2007. A new generation of virtual assistants, like Microsoft's Cortana uses smarter methods of assessing when and how to offer what help. Help options can appear for instance after a pre-defined time of inaction between two usually connected process-steps, instead of popping up whenever a certain word is typed. The boundary between online-help from advanced virtual assistants like Microsoft's Cortana or Apple's Siri and EPSS is not always clear.Techscribe EPSS Both can work like a knowledge navigator or GPS for software. But while Cortana and Siri are more software-specific, an EPPS like Process Guide is more organization-specific. The program does not explain how a certain software works, but instead offers assistance in handling different programs that are in use in an organization as a whole. Cultural context and informal learning The application is unusual for a software made in Germany. Even if the company now has development studios in the US, the UK, Australia and other countries, the developer has its roots in the e-learning and training industry in Germany. Process Guide supports informal learning and training on the job, while training in Germany traditionally relies heavily on formal learning, especially in manufacturing.

The stories are written by Urbanus himself and drawn by Willy Linthout. The first story was published in 1982 and is still in syndication as of this day, being the longest-running and most successful Flemish comic strip based on a celebrity. It's also the longest-running celebrity comic in the world made by the same two creators. The series sells well in the Netherlands too, due to Urbanus' popularity there. Concept In the series Urbanus is portrayed as an eleven to twelve-year old version of himself, despite his full-grown beard. Just like the real Urbanus he lives in Tollembeek, but here end all similarities. Urbanus is portrayed as a bad young boy who frequently tries to trick the local villagers, his parents, his teacher, his fellow students and gets into trouble for it. The style of comedy is absurd, black and often vulgar. All animals in this comic strip are able to talk. Pop culture references to TV shows, comics, cartoons, films and Urbanus' own merchandise are frequently made. The authors deliberately use Flemish dialect instead of standard Dutch and also deliberately keep the drawing style na√Øve and simple, inspired by the series of Marc Sleen. The albums are usually long adventure stories, but some are one-page gags as well. History Willy Linthout drew the first Urbanus story in November 10, 1982, without interference of Urbanus himself. As the comedian felt Linthout didn't quite capture his style he became the series' permanent collaborator from the second album on. From December 16, 1982 until April 25, 1996 all albums were published by Uitgeverij Loempia, a publishing company created by Linthout and Jef Meert. Since 1996 Standaard Uitgeverij does the publishing. Characters The main characters are: * Urbanus: A young ten to twelve-year-old boy. He frequently misbehaves and gets punished for it. * Cesar: Urbanus' father. He is a pigeon racer and farmer who spends most of his time with smoking pipe, drinking beer, reading his newspaper, watching TV and committing adultery with local prostitutes. * Eufrazie: Urbanus' pious mother. She is a housewife who devoutly believes in the Roman Catholic Church and spends most of her time with brushing off a Virgin Mary statue on her closet. * Nabuko Donosor: Nabuko Donosor is Urbanus' dog. He is completely yellow, wears slippers on his feet and the upper jaw of his head floats above the lower jaw. He is actually an alien lifeform, but treated like a dog by everyone else. * Amedee: Urbanus' house fly. He is hyper intelligent and often understands situations or finds solutions to problems the others can't comprehend. * Annatol: Urbanus' goldfish. * Wieske: Urbanus' pig. * Nonkel Fillemon: The family's rich and elderly uncle. Urbanus' family is always waiting for him to pass away so they can inherit his massive fortune, but he always survives. * Jef Patat: A local poor and sleazy scoundrel who lives under a bridge. He is often active in criminal affairs and tries to trick everybody. Patat is more or less the antagonist of the series, if Urbanus doesn't perform that part himself. * Meester Vladimir Kweepeer: The local sadistic but otherwise not very bright headmaster. * Dikke Herman: An obese boy who wears glasses and has a large yellow quiff on his head. He is a frequent target of abuse by other characters, most notably Urbanus himself. * Het Negerken: A local black boy who is nicknamed \\"The Little Negro\\". His real name is Botswana. * Meneer Pastoor: The local Roman Catholic priest. He enjoys drinking sacramental wine and frequently neglects his oath of celibacy by visiting local prostitutes. * Ren√© and Modest: Two local police officers who enjoy beating up people. * Juffrouw Pussy: A young and attractive female teacher who is adored by everyone, especially Urbanus. * Stef, Staff & Stylo: A gang consisting of three thieves who are brothers of differing height. They are clearly inspired by The Daltons. * God: God is portrayed as an angry old man living up in Heaven. He is married and has two children. God is often agitated by Urbanus' behaviour on Earth. Animated film In 1992 a partial animated adaptation of the 18th \\"Urbanus\\" album \\"Het Lustige Kapoentje\\" was made in collaboration with 20th Century Fox. Urbanus voiced himself. It was released on video, but didn't have much success.http://www.urbanus-online.be/kalender.html Some animated shorts were made in 1999, based on the gag comics. They are made available on Urbanus' official site. In 2019 an animated feature film Urbanus de Vuilnisheld premiered in Flemish theaters.https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/02/24/urbanus-de-vuilnisheld- tekenfilm-over-stripfiguur-in-premie/ Crossover In 1997 Urbanus and Linthout made a crossover comic strip named \\"Kiekebanus\\", in which characters from their series meet characters from Merho's series De Kiekeboes. In another De Kiekeboes album, \\"Bij Fanny op Schoot\\" (2005), Urbanus and his family were also guest stars. In popular culture On April 8, 2000 Urbanus, Amedee and Nabuko Donosor received their own statue in Tollembeek. It was designed by Koen Tinel. Urbanus also received a statue in Middelkerke on July 7, 2001. It was sculpted by Luc Cauwenberghs.

He was named after Arjuna, the third of the Pandava brothers from the Hindu epic Mahabharatha. Mysore Dasara Arjuna was captured in 1968 in the Khedda operations from the forests of Kakanakote in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. After he was tamed, he was made a regular at the camps that featured processions during the festival of Dasara in Mysore, in the 1990s. After Drona, the then carrier, fell ill prior to the Dasara festivities, Arjuna was made the carrier of the 750-kg Howdah that houses an idol of a Hindu deity Chamundeshwari, for a year, when the former was made the Nishan. That year, before the festivities began, he wavered and charged at the crowd, as the helicopter hovering above raining flower petals on the howdah came low. Eventually, he calmed down to complete the task. The following years, he was made the Nishan to follow Drona. In 1996, when Arjuna and Bahadur, another Dasara elephant, were taken to Karanji Lake for bathing, Bahadur's mahout Annaiah fell and was trampled upon. It was reported as an accident, but Arjun was blamed upon, for already having been known for his bad temper. He was immediately taken \\"off-duty\\" and was confined to the village Balle, at the Nagarhole National Park, before being brought back to the Dasara camp and made the Nishan in 2001 to Balarama, which he remained till 2011. On course of selection of the carrier for festivities in 2012, Arjuna became the leading contender after he beat Balarama in the rehearsals of carrying the howdah, for five kilometers between Mysore Palace and Bannimantap, by 45 minutes, despite going through periods of musth at the time. His choice as the carrier was confirmed by the organizers in October 2012. Arjuna was carrying the Golden Howdah from 2012 to 2019 (7years). Now his name was dropped over the government order on retiring elephants above 60 years of age and services of such jumbos could be used in any rigorous activities. Arjuna has rested from the duty of carrying the Golden Howdah and has been succeeded by Abhimanyu.

Biography  = Family = Born in Chaves, Portugal in the parish of Santa Maria Maior, on 15 November 1898, he died in Lisbon, in S√£o Vicente de Fora parish, on 6 September 1992, and was buried in the Field of Combatants (Talh√£o dos Combatentes) in the Cemit√©rio do Alto de S√£o Jo√£o. He was the son of Jose Antonio Dias, a businessman and landlord in Chaves, and his wife Ermelinda J√∫lia Lopes da Silva de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa, daughter of Pascal Lino Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa, finance inspector, and his wife Joan Val√©zia Lopes da Silva; and paternal granddaughter of Francisco Jos√© de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa, administrator of the former municipalities of Alhambra, Alverca do Ribatejo, and Moita, and his wife Maria Jos√© Adelaide Moura. He married twice, first in Chaves on 3 July 1923, to Irene da Encarna√ß√£o de Morais Pereira, the daughter of Jos√© Afonso Pereira, an infantry major in charge of the government of the Congo in 1917, and governor of Mexico in 1919 among other positions, and his wife Carmelina da Gl√≥ria de Morais. His second marriage took place in Lisbon on 12 March 1932, to the sister of his first wife, Carmelina da Gl√≥ria de Morais Pereira. Two of his daughters married in Goa, in the chapel of the Pal√°cio do Cabo (the governor's residence), during his tenure. Irene Maria, daughter from his first marriage, in March 1950 married Fernando Sim√µes Coelho da Fonseca (1926-2006), later vice-admiral and president of the Geographical Society of Lisbon in 1975-1978. Fernanda Maria, a daughter from his second marriage, married in March 1951, to Joaquim Arrais do Lago Torres de Magalh√£es (1922- ), later brigadier general and commander of the Artillery School in 1974. He was a relative of Capit√£o-de-Mar-e-Guerra Ver√≠ssimo Jos√© de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa (1843-1917), knight of the Royal Household, the fifth and final Lord of Morgadio do Sardoal, senior official of the Ministry of Marine and founding partner of the Portuguese Naval Military Club, and younger brother of Raimundo Jos√© de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa (1850-1935), General of the Division and Director of Public Works in India, Macau and Timor. The coat of arms belonging to Ver√≠ssimo Jos√© de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa, designed and painted by Carlota Menezes  Professional career  Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias enlisted in 1916. He was promoted to second lieutenant (segundo-tenente) in 1920, first lieutenant (primeiro-tenente) in 1924, captain-lieutenant (capit√£o-tenente) in 1935, lieutenant commander (capit√£o-de-fragata) in 1940, the captain of sea and war (capit√£o-de-mar-e-guerra) in 1946 and commodore in 1953. He was promoted to rear admiral (equivalent to the current rank of vice admiral, which was only introduced in 1977) in 1958. In 1921 he embarked as the ship's chief of the Portuguese Navy battleship Vasco da Gama. In 1922 he was in charge of the navigation cruiser NRP Rep√∫blica (of the Carvalho Ara√∫jo class) during the first air crossing of the South Atlantic by Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. He was commander of the NRP Pedro Nunes in 1941, and NRP Bartolomeu Dias in 1952, having among other missions represented the Portuguese Navy in the ceremonies of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in June 1953. He was also the deputy chief of navy staff in the years 1953-1955 and deputy chief of the armed forces general staff in 1957-1958. Between 1954 and 1958 he also taught at the Naval School of War.  Political and administrative Career  Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias was appointed captain of the port of Chinde, Mozambique, and was also responsible for the hydrographic survey of its sandbar and harbour. From 1925 he was intendant of the government of Chinde, having also acted as captain of Cabo Delgado Province and port of Quelimane (1935). He was also governor of Niassa Province in 1935, and in charge of the Zambezia government in 1937. In 1940, he was chief of staff of the Naval Force exercises and the Naval Force of the Metropolis; in 1941-1943 he was involved in the maritime defense of Lisbon, and acting deputy chief of staff and liaison officer with the Ministry of War. = Governor of India = Later, in Portuguese India, Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias was chief of India's State Marine Services in 1944, as well as chairman of the Board of Directors of Autonomous Portuguese India Navigation Services. He was a member of the state government of the Council of India, then vice-president of this Council in 1946. On August 15, 1947, British India became independent, which made it difficult to predict the future of the (Portuguese) Estado da √çndia. Three days earlier, Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias was placed in charge of the government of Portuguese India in an interim regime, a position that he would occupy until the end of June of the following year. The office of governor- general was first offered to Gabriel Teixeira, then governor-general of Mozambique, a man with extensive experience in the East, having been governor of Macau from 1940 to 1946. When Teixeira declined the offer, Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias, \\"[...] an official with colonial experience, able, hardworking, resourceful and skillfully [...]\\" in the words of the minister of colonies to Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, was appointed governor-general of the State of India in 1948. Also in 1947, following the independence of India, the acting governor had an important role to play in the defense of Goa against the economic blockade imposed by leaders of neighboring Indian states. The role he played in his attempts to overcome the nationalist movement in Goa has been debated; some claim that he only reaped the benefits of the efforts of the previous governor-general. Soon after its independence, India wanted to start negotiations with Portugal on the fate of the Portuguese Estado da √çndia. One of the most contentious issues was the old right of the Padroado Portugu√™s ‚Äî which allowed the Portuguese to appoint bishops to suffragan dioceses in what was now independent India. In 1948, the English prelate of Bombay insisted on resigning. Under the 1928 agreement between Britain, Portugal and the Holy See, this post had alternating between a Portuguese prelate and an English one. Hence, a Portuguese prelate should have been appointed ‚Äî something that already independent India was unwilling to tolerate. The Padroado crisis that followed, from 1948-1953, went along with the government of Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias. As a result, the governor-general officially excluded Archbishop Patriarch Jos√© da Costa Nunes, Patriarch of the Indies ‚Äî who had celebrated the weddings of both his daughters in 1950 and 1951‚Äîfrom the Council of the State of India (Conselho do Governo do Estado da √çndia), because India accused the Portuguese Padroado of being a political instrument of the regime in Lisbon. The protests of the Patriarch of the Indies to Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar over this maneuver proved fruitless. While he was governor-general, he got involved in the transfer of large sums of money through the Reserve Bank of India which caused a scandal because of his close links to wealthy businessmen. He also became infamous after being physically attacked in the Governor‚Äôs palace by Goan lawyer Bruta da Costa from Margao, when he was caught eavesdropping on a conversation between da Costa and Manuel Maria Sarmento Rodrigues in 1952. Governor General Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias had a difficult relationship with infantry major Carlos Alves Ro√ßadas, then chief of the armed forces of the Estado da √çndia. The solution, found by the Minister of Colonies in 1950, was to appoint Alves Ro√ßadas as governor of Cape Verde, another Portuguese-ruled territory. While in India, the then captain- of-sea-and-war (capit√£o-de-mar-e-guerra) collated a collection of over three hundred old books on Portuguese India and the Portuguese in the East. This collection was acquired after his death by the University of Chicago Library and is now a part of the Southern Asian Collection of the Regenstein Library. = Minister of Marine = Back to the metropolis, the captain-of-sea-and-war (capit√£o-de-mar-e-guerra) Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias was the attorney of the Corporate Board by appointment of the Corporate Council and Advisory Council of the Presidency between 1953 and 1958. During that period he was also professor at the Higher Naval Institute of War and acting director of the Institute. In 1958, Admiral Am√©rico Tom√°s, Minister of the Navy since 1944, was the candidate of the Uni√£o Nacional to replace General Craveiro Lopes as presidential candidate in the elections of that year, against General Humberto Delgado. One of the candidates to succeed Tom√°s in the Navy was Henrique Tenreiro, the \\"Fisheries Boss\\", who had long insisted on the creation of a Ministry or Secretary of State for Fisheries. However Salazar preferred \\"[...] a man whose political profile walked close to the Tenreiro, while less controversial and most prestigious within the Navy, considering the merits of his naval career and important places that occupied the colonial administration [...] \\". Fernando Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias was thus named minister of the navy in 1958. As Minister of the Navy, he supported the Estado Novo regime during the \\"Abrilada de 1961\\" or Botelho Moniz coup. That same year, 1961, saw the beginning of overseas conflicts. According to NATO's naval strategy, of which Portugal was a founding member in 1949, the role of the Portuguese Navy in the 1950s was essentially to contain the submarine threat of the Soviet Union in the North Atlantic. With the outbreak of conflicts overseas, the Navy's attention turned from the \\"blue waters\\" of the Atlantic to the \\"brown waters\\" of the African coast. The war, and the coastal geography and climate of Africa, demanded other types of vessels and equipment, compared to those which the navy had at the time. To meet the new requirements, Admiral Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias embarked on an ambitious program to modernize the Portuguese Navy. The French ambassador in Lisbon, Bernard de Menthon, reported to the Quai d'Orsay that the minister of the navy \\"[...] sought to see the president of the Council of the need to start the restructuring program as soon as possible [.. .].\\" In the years 1961-1974 the Portuguese Navy saw the old ships of World War II replaced by 65 new units, including among other classes: monitoring boats (Class Bellatrix and Class Argos (1963)), patrol vessels (class Cacine), corvettes (John Coutinho class), frigates (Jo√£o Belo class and class Admiral Pereira da Silva), and four new submarines (Albacora class). Most of these ships were built in foreign shipyards. Only the lack of capacity and urgent need for delivery meant that some vessels had to be built in foreign shipyards, particularly in Spain, France and Germany. In the ten years in which Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias occupied the Navy portfolio, France and Germany, replaced Portugal's traditional ally - England‚Äîas political allies and arms suppliers. Of all the new ships, the Class John Coutinho, designed by naval engineer and Rear Admiral Roger d'Oliveira, gained international recognition thanks to the quality of the project. Fernando de Quintanilha e Mendon√ßa Dias also played a decisive role in creating the Hydrographic Institute in 1960. He was minister of the Navy until 1968. In the exercise of this office, he was one of the signators of the new Portuguese Civil Code of 1966. He was also the acting minister of Overseas in 1959, and member of the Empire Bar Council until 1969.  Main office held  Ministro da Marinha (15 August 1958 ‚Äì 19 August 1968). Minister of Marine Governador- Geral of the Estado Portugu√™s da √çndia (23 December 1948 ‚Äì 11 October 1952). Governor General Subchefe do Estado-Maior daArmada (12 July 1957 ‚Äì 14 August 1958) e Subchefe do Estado-Maior Naval (8 July 1953 ‚Äì 22 November 1955). Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Navy Director Interino do Instituto Superior Naval de Guerra (27 July 1954 ‚Äì 13 July 1955). Acting Director of Naval Institute of War Professor do Curso Superior do Instituto Superior Naval de Guerra (1954-1958). Professor. Procurador √† C√¢mara Corporativa (VI e VII Legislaturas)(1953-1958) e Assessor do Conselho da Presid√™ncia.

It is surrounded by mountains, the highest of which are Agdlerussakasit (1743 m) to the south of the river, and Angiartarfik (1824 m) to the north. Since there are shoaling problems at low tide, anchorage is best made a short distance from the shore. Access can sometimes be impeded by ice floes in late spring, summer and autumn, but the sea is mostly clear. The remains of a Greenland Norse building are located on the southern side of the Itivdlerssuaq river, not far from the shore. Stordalens Havn with Agdlerussakasit on the skyline Trekking, kayaking and climbing It can be accessed by chartered boat, or by very experienced kayakers, or overland on foot from Tasiussaq. It attracts climbers, kayakers, and trekkers.Willem Vandoorne's trek through Stordalen HavnJoery Truyens's trek through Stordalen HavnTilmann and Suzanne Graner's trek through Stordalen HavnRuth Goris and friends' trek to Stordalen Havn in 2014 First ascents have now been made of most mountains in the area, starting with 44 first ascents by the University of St Andrews Expedition in 1975.Account of mountaineering from Stordalen Havn by the 1975 St Andrews University South Greenland Expedition Some of the mountains have challenging rock faces, including the famous \\"Thumbnail\\" of Maujit Qaqarssuasia, to the west of Torssukatak Fjord. There is huge potential for new climbing routes, and ascents by different ridges. In recent years, from 2000 onwards, Stordalen Havn has been visited by parties of trekkers,Photos and accounts of parties who have trekked or kayaked to Stordalen Havn often accessing the area from Tasermiut Fjord. The small settlement of Aappilattoq to the east is extremely difficult to access on foot, but easily accessed by kayak. There is a trekking route to the north of Stordalen Havn over to Ivssortussut valley (difficult ground on the north side of the col) and Kangerdluk fjord, from where a further mountain pass leads to Lake Taserssuaq and Tasermiut Fjord. The trek west from Stordalens Havn up 'the big valley' called Itivdlerssuaq leads by an easy walking route to the settlement at Tasiussaq. Access down Torssukatak Fjord to the south is only possible by kayak because of huge sea cliffs.

This former industrial area now features canals, ponds, grassland and wooded areas. The reserve lies adjacent to the Warren's Hall Local Nature Reserve (which is in Sandwell Metropolitan Borough). It was declared a local nature reserve in 1996. History The area comprising the Bumble Hole Local Nature Reserve and its neighbour, Warren's Hall Local Nature Reserve, once was a scene of industry, including coal mining, clay extraction, coke furnaces and boat building. A railway (known as the Bumble Hole Line) ran through the area, linking Dudley to Old Hill. Location The reserve is located to the east of Netherton, about 1.5 miles south of Dudley, on the border with Sandwell Metropolitan Borough. Main access is via St Peter's Road, Netherton. Landscape Bumble Hole Lake The reserve contains areas of grassland, small wooded regions, canals and ponds. The Dudley No. 2 Canal runs into the reserve. Two short arms lead off from this canal: the Bumble Hole Branch and the Bushboil Arm. Bumble Hole Lake, a former clay pit, forms the largest body of water in the reserve. There is no visible border with the neighboring Warren's Hall Local Nature Reserve, so the two reserves effectively form a single visitor attraction. Facilities A canal-side visitor centre run by volunteers (the Bumble Hole Conservation Group), offers information on the reserve, as well as refreshments and toilet facilities. There is also a football pitch. Boating festival Annual boating festival at Bumble Hole The reserve (plus the neighboring Warren's Hall Local Nature Reserve) is the site for an annual boating festival. The event attracts canal boats every September and features stalls, canal trips and a funfair.

Gaafar Nimeiry, against the government of President Ismail al-Azhari. The coup signaled the end of Sudan's second democratic era, and saw the beginning of Nimeiry's 16 year rule. Nimeiry's government would pursue a radical Arab nationalist and leftist program, bringing in a socialist program for social and economic development, including widespread nationalization of private property. His government would also push for an end to the First Sudanese Civil War, which by 1969 had been ongoing for nearly 14 years. In pursuing peace, the new government pushed for amnesty, and would declare regional autonomy for Southern Sudan on 9 June 1969. Background Coup The coup began early on the morning of 25 May, and by 4:00 am the key installations in the Khartoum-Bahri-Omdurman area had been occupied and leading Sudanese Army generals arrested. At 7:00 am, Radio Omdurman broadcast recorded speeches by Nimeiry and Babiker Awadalla, setting out their plans for government. Radio Omdurman would later that morning also broadcast the names of the members of the new Council of Ministers, who had been agreed on 23 May in a meeting between Awadalla and the 6 key officers. Whilst the composition of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council had been planned in advance, during the course of the day the Council's membership was expanded. Whilst his fellow Free Officers were visiting key Army units and Security organisations to ensure their loyalty to the new regime, Nimeiry met with two members of the Free Officers who had voted against the coup at the Officers April meeting; Lt. Col. Babikir al-Nur and Maj. Abu al-Qasim Hashim. Both had their respective power bases, with al-Nur being the highest-ranking officer associated with the Sudanese Communist Party, and the latter maintaining key links with civilian Arab nationalists and Nasserists. Nimeiry, without consulting with the other coup plotters, decided to bring both individuals into the new government in order to expand its support base. Another officer associated with the communist party, Hashem al Atta, was also brought into the new council. The new council would therefore be composed of not only those who had implemented the coup, but also representatives of the majority block of the Free Officers Movement; which had opposed the coup in April.

History  In 1995, Bernadette Chirac wished to give the Princess of Wales a unique handbag on the occasion of her visit to Paris. When France's first lady contacted Dior in her search for such a bag, the House offered her a model unofficially named Chouchou at the time. It was officially rechristened Princesse in the short term. The bag, black in color, was presented to the former Lady Diana at the inauguration of the C√©zanne exhibition at the Grand Palais. It was often photographed carried by Diana at public events: she had it with her in Birmingham during an official visit; again a few weeks later during a stay in Argentina; then on several further occasions.Photo 1 sur puretrend.com, Photo 2 sur puretrend.com, Photo 3 sur puretrend.com, Photo 4 sur purepeople.com, Photo 5 sur glamourparis.com It was soon being described as \\"iconic\\", and \\"legendary\\", and was launched in larger series, with its name changed to Lady Dior. Two hundred thousand models were sold in two years and Dior's leather goods turnover increased tenfold. The bag in turn gave its name to a watch in 1999 and inspired a makeup product by Parfums Christian Dior.  Characteristics  Lady Dior is a handbag that adopts Dior's graphic codes and is generally decorated with a cannage (caning) motif inspired by two items of furniture found in Dior's private mansion on Avenue Montaigne since 19473: the Napol√©on III chairs on which the couturier seated the guests at his runway shows, and the back of a neo-Louis XVI medallion armchair Louis XV. The bag is composed of one hundred and forty four pieces in total and is rectangular and rigid, with the four gold- or silver-tone D-I-O-R letters and the Dior logo suspended from the handle as charms. It is available in different materials featuring various techniques (leather, velvet, microfiber, satin, denim, python, crocodile, tweed, jacquard,etc.), and in several sizes.  Advertising  Marion Cotillard was the face of the Lady Dior handbag from 2008 to 2017. Chosen by designer John Galliano, French actress Marion Cotillard became the face of Lady Dior in 2008, a role she played until 2017. In addition to multiple publications in the press photos by Peter Lindbergh, Craig McDean, Tim Walker and Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Marion Cotillard has appeared in several short film commercials mainly intended to be released on the internet. The first was The Lady Noire Affair made by Olivier Dahan, followed by Lady Rouge by Jonas √Ökerlund. The latter followed a series of photos by Annie Leibovitz. Next came Lady Blue Shanghai, a sixteen-minute film by David Lynch. Two more films, Lady Grey London, with Ian McKellen, and L.A.dy Dior were made by John Cameron Mitchell. The actress recalled,\\"I suggested this director to Dior. They didn't know him, but they haven't wanted to let him go since!\\" The CEO of Christian Dior Couture, Sidney Toledano, has said of these short films that the \\"strategic objective is to make people dream by telling beautiful stories\\". In 2012, Cotillard starred in the web-series Lady Dior Web Documentary and wrote and performed the song \\"Lily's body\\" for one episode. She also designed her own handbag for Lady Dior, the \\"360¬∞ bag\\". In 2014, Cotillard wrote and co-directed alongside Eliott Bliss, a music video for her song \\"Snapshot in LA\\", especially for Lady Dior's campaign \\"Enter The Game ‚Äì Dior Cuise 2015\\".

She had her own design studio from 1960 where she designed product for the home, including cutlery. Her dinnerware designs for Royal Copenhagen had a simple, timeless look. Grethe inspired many female architects and designers, pushing open the door to gender equality in the design industry. Most productive in the late 1940s-70s, she focused not only on her pieces but on the consumers, noting that she wanted to produce high quality items that people could afford. Her work is exhibited internationally. Biography Born on 8 April 1918 in Svendborg, she was the daughter of Peter Christian Meyer, a director, and Meta Kirstine Kj√¶ldgaard, a pianist. After matriculating from high school, she studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where she was the only female graduate in the class of 1947. While still at the Academy, she started to work on Bykkebogen, a manual on evolving architectural styles and decor widely used for teaching purposes (1948‚Äì70). She then worked as a researcher at the Statens Byggeforskningsinstitut (Danish Institute for Building Research) in Copenhagen from 1955-1960 before establishing her own firm in 1960. Among her most successful designs are the Boligens Byggeskabe storage system (1954‚Äì59), named for the firm for which it was originally designed, which she developed together with B√∏rge Mogensen, and the Stub & Stamme series of drinking glasses ( Kastrup Glasv√¶rk /Holmegaard, 1958‚Äì60) in cooperation with Ibi Trier M√∏rch. But above all she is remembered for her designs for the Royal Copenhagen porcelain factory, especially her Bl√•kant (Blue Line) faience dinner service (1965), her Hvidpot (White Pot) porcelain dinner service (1972) and her Ildpot (Fire Pot) ovenware (1976). In 1991, she designed the set of cutlery known as Copenhagen for Georg Jensen. Meyer had an analytical eye, studying how people interacted within the home, researching eating habits and space limitations. Her influential research led the way into standardising the size of products. Keeping in mind the way people live with her pieces, she used her knowledge and research to create products that were not only beautiful, but also highly usable and practical. She strongly believed that individuals should have fewer items that they could afford but of the best quality. She used her training and knowledge of form, mass and industrial production techniques to produce pieces which were minimalist yet tactile, a characteristic of all Scandinavian design. Grethe Meyer had her only daughter Dorthe in 1949. Dorthe's father was colleague and fellow architect Bent Salicath, whom Grethe Meyer never married. Opting out on what was considered a woman‚Äôs duty at the time, she devoted her life to pursuing a career and to the constant search for functional and aesthetically simple designs. She was modern in her take on family life and her own role as a woman in a design world that was mostly ruled by men, and lived alone with her daughter. As a consequence she was forced to work even harder to fit life as an employed architect with her personal ambitions of obtaining independence as a designer. Meyer was a member of the board of the Architects' Association of Denmark (1964‚Äì65) and of the Danish Design Council (1977). 1997 Danish Design Award Acceptance Speech Grethe Meyer‚Äôs speech on the occasion of receiving the Danish Design Award, December 8, 1997: \\"I think it would be appropriate to explain a little about my method of working. Mostly, I meet new tasks by trying to build on earlier inspirations and ideals, improving them and, where needed, bringing their qualities up to date while preserving what I think is important‚Äî namely that the design must be uncomplicated, the product easy and comfortable to use and as simple and anonymous as possible in the expression of its properties. In this way, I think that beauty will present itself‚Äîa beauty that gives the people who are using the product a natural pleasure, a pleasure which preferably grows stronger the more the product is used. I would like to quote a line from a hymn: 'If all the kings went forth one day with all their might and fettle, They could not set the smallest leaf to grow upon a nettle.' The humility Brorson expresses here is something we designers can carry with us. I must say that the older I get, the more I wonder and feel how fabulous the whole creation of the universe is. I have a deep, deep admiration, reverence and respect for the powers, forces, call it what you will, that could create our wonderful world. I get dizzy when I think of it, especially considering that I know how many decisions and how much time it takes just to make a simple, small object, such as a spoon, which is composed of only one material and which only has to fulfill a few functions, and certainly never can or shall grow as a plant or an animal. When we consider the universe which is continually expanding and evolving, and we try to understand‚Äîof course in vain‚Äîhow infinitely great it is, we know that each of us can‚Äôt even be perceived as a tiny little dot. All the same, I find it very important that each of us put our full endeavor into the work we do, and for us creative individuals to persevere until we reach the core, the essential, the soul of the matter. Fulfillment of this demand requires both discipline, precision, engagement and complete attention, but also love for the work. We are not just born with these abilities. They can only be acquired during a lifetime. It can happen in many ways, as for example in fellowship and cooperation with people who are important for our development. Often it begins with our parents, then teachers and other inspiring and charismatic people. These are people to whom you owe something. There is one person in my life that I want to mention: B√∏rge Mogensen, with whom I cooperated on Boligens Byggeskabe. We probably had many common strains in our minds, plus his stubborn axiom: 'Go back to the beginning and start all over again if, at the back of your mind, you know that not all is right in what you are doing.' Working this way was natural to both of us. He was the most creative and artistic designer I have known in our profession. It was a privilege to meet and work with him. I‚Äôm not a painter or a sculptor, although I would have liked to have been both. And as I‚Äôm not, I do not translate my intentions into physical specimens or unique pieces. I therefore share this prize with all the artisans, silversmiths, chemists, technicians and other specialists who have understood my thoughts and drawings and turned them into the finished products. They are, or have all been, linked to Royal Copenhagen where it all started or maybe, should I say, some of it got started. Today, I want to express a strong wish that in the future much more consideration be given to the environment in all areas than has previously been the case. And, of course, also in the field of design in order to safeguard our beautiful but fragile earth‚Äîsomething that my generation, unfortunately, has not been very dedicated to. And now, as we are assembled in this house [The House of Industry], I will take the liberty of addressing my opinion to the Industries. I recommend that they keep as many jobs in this country as possible, while at the same time making sure to keep good craftsmanship alive, which is essential for the quality of products to be maintained. Thus: Get many more jobs for apprentices, keep and maintain the machinery at the factories and start new, smaller companies. They were the ones that have established the quality of Danish craft and industry in the past. If this is not heeded, we shall be left one day with an impoverished country, without living companies and a population without opportunities for decent employment opportunities. Then we can start all over again to rebuild a country that hasn‚Äôt developed, but instead has deteriorated and turned into a service industry. We have seen this happen in many places in the world. Finally, I will thank the Danish Design Center. You have all been so kind and helpful in connection with this event. Lastly, I will turn to the board of directors and say thank you for giving me the prize. Thank you for making me happy.\\" Notable works= = Bla Kant (Blue Line), 1965 = Named for the fine blue line that runs along the edges of the light grey faience, this dinnerware line received the inaugural Danish Industrial Design Prize (ID) in 1965. = Ildpot (Firepot), 1976 = One of Meyer's best-selling home designs was her Ildpot, a line of earthenware dishes. They were meant to go directly from one's freezer to one's oven and then straight onto the dinner table to save time in the preparation of food and increase time spent enjoying one's company in the home. Before the 1970's, it had not been possible to produce bowls and dishes that could withstand the large temperature change when taking a dish from the freezer and putting it directly into the oven. Meyer studied and tweaked the design of the Fireboat to come up with a way to use oven space optimally. Fireboat was produced in cordierite, which is a magnesium mineral with a low thermal expansion that endures great changes in environmental temperature without breaking. The pots themselves could not be glazed, but with use over time, they begin to take on an individual dark patina. Meyer was awarded with the Danish Industrial Design Prize in 1976 for the Ildpot designs. = GM 15 and GM 30 pendant lamps, 1984 = In 2004, The GM 15 and GM 30 lamps were created based on Grethe Meyers original sketches from May 1984. 20 years after their conception, the Danish brand Menu put the 'Grethe Meyer Lamp' into production for the first time.

A gobiconodontid eutriconodont, it is notable for the remarkable degree of preservation, offering profound insights to the biology of non-therian mammals.Thomas Martin, Jes√∫s Marug√°n-Lob√≥n, Romain Vullo, Hugo Mart√≠n-Abad, Zhe-Xi Luo & Angela D. Buscalioni (2015). A Cretaceous eutriconodont and integument evolution in early mammals. Nature 526, 380‚Äì384. doi:10.1038/nature14905 Description Spinolestes' holotype, MCCMLH30000A', hails from Las Hoyas, Spain. The living animal was about 24 centimeters long and weighted somewhere between 50 and 70 grams. As a Konservat-Lagerst√§tten specimen, it is famous for being remarkably well preserved, including not only the skeleton but also multiple soft tissues like fur, skin, internal organs and ears (both external and internal), a rarity among Mesozoic mammals. Besides soft-tissues, Spinolestes is also remarkable for its xenarthrous vertebrae, convergent with those of xenarthrans and to a lesser extent hero shrews. = Soft tissue = Hair is very well preserved, down to the cellular level; among fossil mammals it is among the best preserved. Spinolestes' fur was similar to that of modern mammals, possessing coumpound hair follicles with primary and secondary hair. The guard hairs are proto-spines similar to those of modern spiny mice. In some places on the body, hairs appear to have broken off close to the skin and were discolored near the broken tip ‚Äì possible signs of dermatophytosis, making it the first Mesozoic mammal with a clear record of a skin infection. Besides hair, Spinolestes also had keratinous scutes. Uniquely among Mesozoic mammal fossils the internal organs are also preserved, deposits of iron marking the position of the liver and microscopic structures being interpreted as the bronchioles. These are separated by a curved line, assumed to be the thoracic diaphragm. The ear is very well preserved. The external ear (pinnae) is fairly large and broad in a mouse-like fashion. The inner ear is also exceptionally preserved in the form of the Meckel's cartilage, which may be of extreme relevance in understanding the evolution of the mammalian ear. Phylogeny Features in the dention and post-cranial skeleton suggest that Spinolestes was a gobiconodontid eutriconodont. Cladogram after Thomas Martin et all 2015: Palaeobiology Like most eutriconodonts, Spinolestes was animalivorous, probably an insectivore. It was a terrestrial animal with some adaptations for fossoriality, possessing strong forelimbs with large claws. This, alongside the convergent traits with xenarthrans may indicate that it was ecologically similar to modern anteaters, pangolins, echidnas, aardvark, aardwolf and numbat, feeding on colonial insects like ants and termites. If this is the case, it would be the second known Mesozoic mammal to pursue such a diet after Fruitafossor. The presence of spines and scutes make Spinolestes one of the earliest armoured mammals known. The evidence of dermatophytosis in the holotype sets the precedent that Mesozoic mammals, like modern species, were also vulnerable to fungal infections. Ecology The environment of Las Hoyas dates to the Barremian, and it was probably a tropical or subtropical wetland habitat, based on its vegetation: Bennettitales, Brachyphyllum, Pagiophyllum, Sphenolepis and Cupressinocladus conifers, Weitchselia reticulata, Montsechia vidali and several others. Various species of fish and aquatic invertebrates are also known.Fossilworks: Las Hoyas Crocodylomorphs are the most common tetrapod fossils, bearing a wide variety of species from familiar semi-aquatic species as well as terrestrial forms like gobiosuchids and atoposaurids, the latter probably having competed with mammals. Non-avian dinosaurs are present in the form of Pelecanimimus and Mantellisaurus, but the site is more notable for a variety of enantiornithe birds like Iberomesornis, Concornis and Eoalulavis. Pterosaurs are represented by ornithocheirids, istiodactylids and the tapejarid Europejara.

The process uses a mixture of metal powders and polymer binders ‚Äì also known as \\"feedstock\\" ‚Äì which are then injection-moulded. After moulding, the parts are thermally processed in order to remove the binding agent. They are then sintered to a high-density metal component which has mechanical properties comparable to wrought materials. 3D metal moulding is mainly used to achieve intricate and complex shapes that are very difficult or expensive to produce using conventional manufacturing methods. Applications 3D metal molding is used in aerospace, medical and other industries. Its popularity is due to its strength in the form of a custom shape or part. More commonly found as a 3D mold are thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Both of these processes are used in the following industries: *Environmental *Marine *Oil and gas *Housing *Construction *Food equipment/handling *Appliance *Automotive *Waste water treatment *HVAC *Medical *Consumer *Commercial *Recreational *Aerospace *Telecommunications *Dental. Benefits * It only uses the exact volume of material required to create the part, reducing costs. * Once the tooling is created huge volumes of high quality parts can be produced with little lead time. * MIM can achieve intricate parts with complex geometries reducing the requirement for secondary operations, such as brand engravings. * Parts can be moulded from a wide range of materials including 'exotic' metals. * 3D Metal Moulding is perfect for volumes of 1000 plus ‚Äì and can also be extremely cost effective for smaller quantities, although this is material dependent. 3D metal printing 3D metal printing builds components by delivering the powdered metal and binder in alternative layers through a nozzle controlled by a computer system, working to a CAD drawing. The initial process does not achieve the required strength so parts must go through a secondary process which involves fusing another type of metal into the shape. There are multiple methods used in 3D metal printing. Selective laser sintering, or SLS, uses heat from a powerful laser to fuse tiny ceramic, glass or plastic particles together, forming a 3D part. Carl Deckard and Joe Beaman of the University of Texas developed and patented the process in the 1980s. Direct metal laser sintering, or DMLS, uses a laser to sinter powdered metal into a solid object in gradual layers built upon each other. Cooling channels can be printed to any shape in this process, which lessens time and waste and improves quality. Selective laser melting, or SLM, completely melts the powder to form a homogenous part. This process can only be used for single materials, so is not suitable for alloys.

Abby Sen is a 30-year-old television producer. He is academically brilliant, has a strong background in science and watching science fiction films is his greatest passion. But his programmes on television are never popular and fail to make a mark on the TRP ratings. And that is perhaps the only reason why Abby has lost no less than seven jobs. Every time he is fired, his wife Somy gets hysterical and throws down everything that she could lay her hands on. So Abby has not disclosed his last dismissal to her. By sheer coincidence, Abby meets a self-styled scientist who claims to have discovered a time-travel capsule. The scientist volunteers to take Abby back in time when getting a job was not that difficult. But he has certain conditions, which Abby must fulfill. Finding all options bleak, Abby decides to agree to his conditions and travel 33 years back in time, that is, in 1980. Thereafter, a series of unforeseen incidents and intricacies of relationships make Abby's life in 1980 as eventful as ever. But flung between the two worlds of 1980 and 2013 both in his personal and professional life, Abby represents the predicament of a man struggling to survive in this competitive world. Science The film subtly touches the theory of chronology protection conjecture. Despite Abby Sen's effort, the past chronology remains unchanged. The director did not venture into nitty gritty of time travel theory. He rather nicely explained the intricacies, human relationship can face in case of such event!

Humans can contract the virus from contact with livestock infected with Bovine papular stomatitis and the disease is common among ranchers, milkers, and veterinarians. Infection in humans will present with fever, fatigue, and lesion on the skin. Signs and symptoms Human skin infected with paravaccinia virus. Paravaccinia virus presents itself with blisters, nodules, or lesions about 4 mm in diameter, typically in the area that has made contact with livestock that is infected with bovine papular stomatitis. Lesions may begin forming as late as three weeks after contact has been made with an infected animal. In rare cases, lesions may be seen systemic. General signs of infection are also common, such as fever and fatigue. Infected livestock may present with blisters or lesions on their udders or snout. Often, however, infected livestock show little to no symptoms. Mechanism Paravaccinia is a member of the Parapoxvirus family. It has a cylindrical body about 140 X 310 nm in size, with convex ends covered in a criss-cross pattern of rope like structures. The virus is resistant to cold, dehydration, and temperatures up to 56 ¬∞C. Upon injecting a cell with its genome, the virus begins transcription in the cytoplasm using viral RNA polymerase. As the virus progresses through the cell, the host begins to replicate the viral genome between 140 minutes and 48 hours. Diagnosis Diagnosis of paravaccinia virus will often come from Polymerase chain reaction screening ordered by their physician. However, due to how common paravaccinia virus is in rural areas, individuals typically do not seek professional help in diagnosis. Instead individuals may refer to people with local knowledge of the cattle in their area such as ranchers, or veterinarians who have some familiarity with the infections in the region. Cause and prevention Paravaccinia virus originates from livestock infected with bovine papular stomatitis. When a human makes physical contact with the livestock's muzzle, udders, or an infected area, the area of contact will become infected. Livestock may not show symptoms of bovine papular stomatitis and still be infected and contagious. Paravaccinia can enter the body though all pathways including: skin contact by mechanical means, through the respiratory tract, or orally. Oral or respiratory contraction may be more likely to cause systemic symptoms such as lesions across the whole body A person who has not previously been infected with paravaccinia virus should avoid contact with infected livestock to prevent contraction of disease. There is no commercially available vaccination for cattle or humans against paravaccinia. However, following infection, immunization has been noted in humans, making re-infection difficult. Unlike other pox viruses, there is no record of contracting paravaccinia virus from another human. Further, cattle only show a short immunization after initial infection, providing opportunity to continue to infect more livestock and new human hosts. Treatment and prognosis Lesions of paravaccinia virus will clear up with little to no scarring after 4 to 8 weeks. An antibiotic may be prescribed by a physician to help prevent bacterial infection of the lesion area. In rare cases, surgical removal of the lesions can be done to help increase rate of healing, and help minimize risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Upon healing, no long term side effects have been reported. History Paravaccinia virus was first characterized in by Edward Jenner in 1799 with the presence of lesions on humans, later described as Milker's nodule. Jenner associated the lesions found on human who had contact with infected cattle. Since first being characterized in cows, bovine papular stomatitis has been isolated in sheep, goats, and red deer creating new potential sources for human infection. Bolvine papular stomatitis has been reported in the United States of America, Great Britain, Brazil, Switzerland, and Japan Disease in animals Pseudocowpox is a worldwide disease of cattle. Symptoms include ring or horseshoe shaped scabs on the teats, which usually heal within six weeks. Lesions may also develop on the muzzles and in the mouths of nursing calves. Spread is by fomites, including hands, calves' mouths, and milking machines. Lesions may also appear on the hands of milkers, a clinical presentation known as milker's nodule. This disease in humans is nearly identical to orf. Research Very little research has been done on Paravaccinia virus in humans over the last 40 years. However the cattle variant has been studied due to an unusual case in Great Britain in 2009 as well as isolation in new hosts. The cattle discussed showed particularly severe lesions on their body found to be linked to the virus. Several case studies have been done including one by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

It began in 2011 by scientist Andrea Kuszewski. The name is derived from the meme I Can Has Cheezburger?. Process Users request articles by tweeting an article's title, DOI or other linked information like a publisher's link, their email address, and the hashtag \\"#ICanHazPDF\\". Someone who has access to the article might then email it to them. The user then deletes the original tweet. Alternately, users who do not wish to post their email address in the clear can use direct messaging to exchange contact information with a volunteer who has offered to share the article of interest. Use and popularity The practice amounts to copyright infringement in numerous countries, and so is arguably part of the 'black open access' trend. The majority of requests are for articles published in the last five years, and most users are from English-speaking countries. Requests for biology papers are more common than papers in other fields, despite subscription prices for chemistry, physics, and astronomy being, on average, higher than for biology. Possible reasons for people to use the hashtag include the reluctance of readers to pay for article access and the speed of the process compared to most university interlibrary loans.

Earlier the name of this place was called Panchalangala Mahadhanapuram and now the village is called Mahadhanapuram village and Panchalingapuram village .Prior to States Reorganisation, the present Kanyakumari District was in Kerala . The founder of Travancore was Maharaja Marthanda Varrma. He was always surrounded by enemies and by his strategy he defeated many chieftains of principalities and consolidated into one compact unit of Travancore. He shifted the capital from Padmanabhapuram (in Kanyakumari District) to Trivandrum and dedicated his kingdom to the feet of Lord Padmanabha of Trivandrum. Hence the Travancore Rulers title start with ‚ÄòSri Padmanabha Dasa‚Äô. Perhaps due to a lot of ‚ÄòHimsa‚Äô caused to many people during various battles, he donated many lands in villages to people. One such village was Mahadanapuram. In the Year 1753( 928Kolla Varsham) Sagavarsham 1674. Eighteen vedic Scholars were selected(which included may be 3 whose mother tongue might be Telugu).Most of them seem to be hailing outside Travancore. Each of them were given, a house, Agricultural land ,to be equally divided between them for cultivation of paddy and small dry land for medicinal plants etc. The Agriculture land which is next to a huge tank called Periakulam (Narikulam ) which gets filled up by rains. The entire area of land is called ‚Äò Dana Pramanam‚Äô (Details of this are available in a Copper plate kept at the present Gramam House).The lands were free from all taxes except water Tax which was Rs1/- per acre.( This was abolished during 1930-1940 when the entire land was taxed uniformly as per other lands in the state.) Later a low lying tank which was in the midst of the fields was filled up and converted to agricultural land and the income was utilised for conducting various festivals and day to day expenses such as cleaning the village, payment to watchmen, payment to Priests of Rig, Yajur, Samavedas for conducting rituals like marriage, upanayanam etc.\`As time rolled on some of the descendants of the recipients of the Danam migrated to other places for government Service, higher education etc with the result the land was either sold to others, Important Festival On Vijaya Dasami day The Goddess from Kanyakumari comes to this village to kill an Asura The goddess is seated in Silver horse Vahanam and the procession is silent. Just outside the village there is a Mandapam where a bow and arrows are kept. Towards dusk when the Goddess reaches this Tosite, the priest shoots arrows in all four directions and finally shoots on a tender coconut. When this is done symbolizing the killing of the Asura , nagaswarams and other music instruments play to indicate that there is victory over evil. Then the Goddess comes in procession into the village and returns to Kanyakumari late in the night. The expenses towards lighting by lighted cloth balls fixed to poles (cloth balls are drenched in Oil and lighted)and any other incidental expenses for coming to the village from the Mandapam is met by the village.

Due to lack of funds, the car was built and tested once before the team withdrew from Formula One in April 1995. Conception The LH95 was conceived by Larrousse's chief designer Robin Herd during the team's final Formula One campaign in . Though Herd designed the car, the team's money problems meant that only one was built but never raced. The team appeared on the entry list for the 1995 season, but needed to merge with an organisation with an available F1 chassis in order to compete. There were two options in Lola, which had built Larrousse's chassis from to , and French International Formula 3000 team DAMS, which was in possession of a Reynard-designed F1 chassis with which it hoped to enter the sport in the future. However, the Lola option was unrealistic as the British manufacturer had fallen out with Larrousse some years before when the team failed to pay for its chassis, while G√©rard Larrousse failed to come to an agreement with DAMS owner Jean-Paul Driot over the winter of 1994‚Äì95, Driot subsequently announcing that DAMS would not enter F1 in any capacity in 1995. Larrousse consequently ordered the previous year's chassis, the LH94, to be modified to meet new technical regulations for 1995, whilst he waited to see if the French government would give the team financial support, as way of compensation for the fact that the so-called \\"Evin's Law\\" had banned possible revenue from tobacco and alcohol sponsorship. In the meantime, he was forced to sell his majority shareholding in the team to compatriots Laurent Barlesi and Jean Messaoudi, who had attempted but failed to enter their own F1 team for 1995. During this period, the team's potential driver line-up was in flux: √ârik Comas, Emmanuel Collard, Elton Julian, √âric H√©lary, Christophe Bouchut and √âric Bernard were all suggested as possible drivers. Two weeks before the opening race of the season in Brazil, it was announced that Larrousse would not receive any government money. The following week, the team elected to miss the first two races of the season in Brazil and Argentina, reasoning that it was better to focus on building a new car than upgrading the LH94, which would have been expensive and difficult to achieve. However, the team's situation remained extremely difficult: Cosworth refused to supply engines without being paid; G√©rard Larrousse's former partners Patrick Tambay and Michel Golay took legal action against him in France; and planned backing from Petronas was dependent on the team taking part in a Grand Prix. One week before the San Marino Grand Prix, Larrousse announced his team's withdrawal from F1, blaming others for failing to produce promised funding. At the same time, he announced his intention to return to the sport for , but the team's debts and lawsuits from former partners, drivers and suppliers made this impossible. The team's closure was a further blow to French motorsport, following the demise of the AGS team in 1991 and the takeover of the Ligier team by Flavio Briatore and Tom Walkinshaw in 1994.

It advocated for Liberal candidates to stand in elections despite the war-time electoral pact. The organisation was founded in 1941 as the Liberal Action Group. It included some prominent members of the Liberal Party who disagreed with the war-time electoral pact in which the Liberals, Conservative Party and Labour Party agreed not to stand candidates against each other. Initially, its leading figures were Lancelot Spicer, Honor Balfour and Everett Jones, while Philip Fothergill became treasurer and Donald Johnson was the first chairman.Chris Cook, A Short History of the Liberal Party: 1900 - 2001, pp.268-269Peter Barberis, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.316 The group supported a wide range of policies; it was more radical and less libertarian than much of the Liberal Party and accepted the need for government intervention. It strongly opposed the National Liberal Party and any possible merger with it, and called for more internal party democracy, new party structures to revitalise the party, and for the party to stand as many candidates as possible at the next general election.Henry Pelling, Britain and the Second World War, p.185 By 1943 the group had the support of 23 Liberal Prospective Parliamentary Candidates. Johnson resigned from the Liberal Party to stand unsuccessfully in the 1943 Chippenham by- election and was replaced by Spicer as chairman, then Balfour followed suit and only lost the 1943 Darwen by-election by 70 votes. The group endorsed Margery Corbett Ashby as an independent Liberal at the 1944 Bury St Edmunds by-election. Support for the group only increased within the party, with five MPs joining, including Megan Lloyd-George, Clement Davies, and newly elected William Beveridge. The group dissolved in 1945 after World War II ended and the electoral pact was discontinued. Several former members assumed leading positions in the party; Davies became leader, Fothergill treasurer, and Lloyd- George was later appointed as deputy leader.Jorgen Scott Rasmussen, The Liberal Party: a study of retrenchment and revival, p.15 References Category:Liberal Party (UK) Category:Organizations established in 1941 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1945 Category:Political advocacy groups in the United Kingdom ","title":"Radical Action"},{"id":"48324359","text":"Aron Ra (formerly L.

It was crowd-funded on Indiegogo. The company is based in Sunnyvale, California and founded by Bob Roohparvar and Frankie Roohparvar. Product details = Claims = A patent was filed by Fariborz Frankie Roohparvar with the priority date of September 20, 2010. The Batteroo Boost is claimed to extend the life of both new and used batteries. Batteroo has said that Batterisers are non-toxic, reusable, and coated with a non-conductive coating to prevent any risk of shorts. They also claim that a built-in reverse polarity protection mechanism eliminates dangers of inserting a battery into the Batteriser the wrong way. = Initial funding = Crowdfunding completed between July 2015 produced $394,459, while the initial goal was $30,000. During the crowdfunding Batteroo announced they would be producing Batteroo Boost for AA, AAA, C, and D batteries. Batteroo also received VC funding of at least $5,000,000 from SK Telecom and Forte Ventures, in July 2014. In August 2017, Batteroo launched a second crowd- funding campaign for a line of products for rechargeable batteries called Batteroo Reboost. In this crowd-funding campaign, they raised an additional $42,311. = Production = The shipping date for the product has been delayed for various reasons, but photos from the manufacturing process have been made available. As of early May 2016, the company was months overdue to ship to its Indiegogo backers, with some backers accusing Batteroo of running a scam. =Product tests= In the test by UL (safety organization), a Garmin Golf GPS using Batteroo Boost was shown to have a lifespan of 10 hours and 12 minutes, in contrast to the 1 hour and 43 minutes of operating time without a Batteroo Boost. However, later the test was independently duplicated by TechnologyCatalyst to demonstrate that Garmin runs OK for over 17 hours on ordinary AA batteries, and the report by UL was based on the sloppy test design. PC World's Jon Phillips demoed the Batteroo Boost operating on batteries in an Apple Inc. keyboard that he claimed were dead. The 'power meter' on the computer's screen showed the batteries as being dead without the Batteroo Boost, and as having 100% power remaining with the Batteriser. Brian Dipert at EDN called into question the strain on the keyboard being caused by the 'power meter,' and suggested that this test might not be representative of the Batteroo Boost's effectiveness in other applications. Controversies =Effectiveness= thumbrightVoltage of an AA alkaline battery during constant-current discharge at 100mA. Energy extracted from the battery is proportional to the area under the graph: The Batteriser's efficacy in consumer applications has been challenged by a number of sources. A source of contention surrounds the brownout voltages for battery-operated devices. David L. Jones in his EEVBlog used a programmable power supply to determine that nearly all devices function in some respect until around 1.1V, or roughly 80% of a battery's life due to the non-linear discharge curve of batteries. This stands in contrast to Batteroo's claim that using a Batteroo Boost will unlock the remaining 80% of power (from 1.3V downwards). Batteroo has claimed that the bench power supply test is flawed, because of the definitions used by Jones to define device functionality, the inherent differences between power supplies and batteries on the basis of Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), and different measures of voltage (confusion between open circuit voltage and closed circuit voltage). A further source of controversy is that the Batteroo Boost will shorten battery life in devices that undergo only intermittent use, because the Batteriser is always drawing power to boost the voltage, even when the device is idle. The first devices were delivered at the end of 2016. Frank Buss, and later on, Dave Jones, concluded in a first test that the device is not efficient when used in an electronically-unregulated toy train. =Potential dangers= David Jones on EEV Blog raised the concern that because the Batteroo Boost acts as a ground for the boost converter circuit, any nick in the insulation might result in a direct short, and potentially a fire. =Internet controversy= In the wake of Dave Jones' video about Batteriser, his video was disliked by an abnormally large amount Youtube accounts with IP addresses located in Vietnam. Other bloggers with Batteroo Boost-related videos experienced similar activity from addresses in Vietnam. The bloggers involved suspect that either a click farm in Vietnam was engaged to disrepute those attacking Batteroo Boost, or a single computer with many fake or stolen YouTube accounts utilized proxied IP addresses to cover its tracks. = Lawsuit regarding name = On July 25, 2016, Energizer Brands LLC filed a federal lawsuit, saying that the name Batteriser violates a variety of its trademarks on the word \\"energizer\\". The lawsuit said that \\"... despite advertisements, solicitation, and pre-orders, Batteroo has not delivered a single Batteriser product to a consumer in the ordinary course of business.\\" According to the lawsuit, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled June 27 in favor of Energizer and refused registration of the Batteriser and Batterise marks. According to Energizer, Batteroo also tried to falsely implicate Energizer in the product delays of Batteriser.

He was deputy and then senator for Corsica between 1910 and 1955. He was Minister of the Navy from 1920 to 1921, Minister of Public Education for two days in June 1924 and Minister of Labor and Social Security from 1931 to 1932. He was the author of several books on economics and demographics. He saw that countries like France had moved from an age of high birth rates and high mortality, with the size of the population determined by the amount of food available, through a transition period to an age of low birth rates and long lives. The population might actually shrink unless the government took steps to encourage larger families. Early years (1874‚Äì1919) Michel Auguste Adolphe Landry was born on 29 September 1874 in Ajaccio, Corsica, to an old Corsican family. He had one brother, who became director of the French Institute in Florence, and three sisters. One of them, Marguerite Pichon-Landry, became president of the National Council of French Women (Conseil National des femmes fran√ßaises). He attended secondary school in N√Æmes, where his father was president of the tribunal, then at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. He was admitted to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, where he gained an agr√©gation de philosophie, which qualified him as an associate professor in philosophy. Landry moved to Toulouse, where he married in 1897. They had two children. He then turned to the law, which he studied at the Sorbonne. In his 1901 thesis on the social utility of private property Landry presented the work of Karl Marx as an important achievement, but one that could be corrected and improved. He condemned capitalism and its obsession with profit, and saw value in a form of socialism that incorporated marginalism and liberalism. This thesis drew considerable comment, much of it hostile. In 1904 he published L'int√©r√™t du capital, followed by various other works on economics, the history of art, political sociology and so on. In 1907 he was appointed to the chair of economic history at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes. Landry ran for election to the chamber of deputies on 6 May 1906 but did not succeed. He ran again for the Calvi constituency in 1910 and this time was elected in the second round. In the chamber he was particularly interested in the subject of commerce. In 1912 Landry became a member of the board of the natalist Alliance nationale contre le d√©population (National Alliance Against Depopulation). He was influential in obtaining the passage of the 1913 law for assistance to large families. Landry ran for reelection for Calvi on 26 April 1914 and won in the first round. He was extremely active on issues such as workers' and peasants' pensions, family income tax, trade and finance. Inter-war period (1919‚Äì40) On 16 November 1919 Landry was reelected on the platform of the Corsican Democratic Republican Party (Parti r√©publicain d√©mocratique corse). In 1920 he obtained creation of the \\"large family card\\" (carte famille nombreuse) which gave public transport discounts to families with more than two children. On 24 September 1920 he was appointed Minister of the Navy in the cabinet of Georges Leygues, which resigned on 12 January 1921. As Minister he revived the Acad√©mie de Marine. Landry was elected vice-president of the chamber in 1923, and reelected in 1924. He was rapporteur general of the finance committee. On 11 May 1924 Landry was reelected on the platform of the Corsican Democratic Republican Party. He again sat on the Finance Committee. On 9 June 1924 he was appointed Minister of Education, Fine Arts and Technical Education in the ephemeral cabinet of Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois-Marsal, which lasted for only 24 hours between the 3rd cabinet of Raymond Poincar√© and the 1st cabinet of √âdouard Herriot. On 22 April 1928 Landry was easily elected as deputy for Ajaccio. Again he sat on the finance committee, and supported measures such as family support, affordable housing and the birth rate. He was often rapporteur of projects or proposed laws related to social or family issues, notably the 1930 Social Assurance Law. He was elected senator on 14 January 1930 but resigned on 13 February 1930 and returned to the chamber. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Security in the 1st and 2nd cabinets of Pierre Laval, from 27 January 1931 to 16 February 1932. He passed the law that extended family allowances to all workers in commerce and industry. Landry ran unsuccessfully for reelection on 1 May 1932. He lost again in the elections on 26 April 1936, but the result was invalidated, and he was elected in a fresh vote on 30 August 1936. He was again involved in proposals related to family and social problems. On 22 February 1939 the High Committee of the Population was created, with Landry as one of the five members. On 30 June 1939 the committee submitted a basic report to the government that became the Family Code (Code de la Famille) by decree on 29 July 1939. He abstained from voting on the draft constitutional law on 10 July 1940 that established the Vichy government. The government removed him from his office as mayor of Calvi. Post-war career (1945‚Äì56) After the Liberation of France Landry would not accept appointment to the Provisional Consultative Assembly due to his Republican principles. He was appointed chairman of the committee on the cost of the enemy occupation, then as a member of the high consultative committee on population and the family. He was charged with advising the government on matters related to protecting the family, increasing the birthrate and integrating foreigners. He was elected to the first National Consultative Assembly on 21 October 1945, and then to the second National Consultative Assembly on 2 June 1946. In 1945 he gained acceptance of the principle of the family quotient, which came into force in 1948 and reduced the inequalities between rich and poor families. Landry failed to be elected to the legislature in the elections of November 1946, but was elected Councilor of the Republic on 8 December 1946. In 1947 he moved to New York to reestablish the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, and was elected president of this organization. In 1949 he was named honorary president. He joined the Rally of Left Republicans (Rassemblement des gauches r√©publicaines, RGR) in the Council of the Republic. He was again active in discussions on social issues. From 1952 he no longer took part in debates due to his poor health. He did not run for reelection on 19 June 1955. Adolphe Landry died on 30 August 1956 in Paris at the age of 81. Demographic theories Landry's interest in demographics developed in the inter-war period, culminating in the publication in 1934 of La R√©volution d√©mographique (The Demographic Revolution). This book reviewed the evolution of the world population from the 18th century to the inter-war period. Landry identified three demographic stages, the last being stagnation or depopulation. He said the government should respond by giving strong incentives for parents to have more children, such as family allowances and child care. Landry argued that a worldwide shift in the relative size of populations of countries would change the balance of power and threaten the position of France. In Landry's view, before the mid-18th century the human population was strictly regulated by the resources available to support that population. After then, in Europe, there was a transition stage where people became able to regulate the length of their life and the number of children they had. People would react to the decrease in infant mortality by limiting the number of children. There would be a lag while the population learned that the drop in infant mortality was real, and adjusted to new social norms that place less importance in large families. He thought in the final stage there was a real possibility of depopulation. Landry's theories were precursors of the theory of \\"demographic transition\\" that developed after World War II.

From 1989 to 1991, he was the president of the International Statistical Institute. Biography =Early life= Gunnar Kulldorff was born in Malm√∂, Sweden on 6 December 1927, as the son of Erik and Ebba Kulldorff. In 1946, he entered Lund University, where he studied mathematics, statistics and mechanics, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1949.Inbjudning till doktorspromotionen vid Lunds Universitet, 1961, p.61 =Scientific career= In 1954 Kulldorff earned a licentiate degree from the Department of Statistics at Lund University. Taking a teaching positions in the same department, he did his doctoral studies under the supervision of Carl-Erik Quensel and Harald Cram√©r. Kulldorff's research led to a PhD in 1961 for his thesis \\"Contributions to the Theory of Estimation from Grouped and Partially Grouped Samples\\".Kulldorff, 1961 His thesis was republished by John Wiley & Sons as well as by the Soviet Union in a Russian translation. In a review for the Journal of the American Statistical Association, W. Edwards Deming wrote that \\"here is a book that faces reality, carrying the reader, in a modest 144 pages, on a wondrous excursion into the problems of grouped data, in which the reader cannot fail to catch the contagious enthusiasm of the author\\" . In 1965, Kulldorff was appointed as the first professor of statistics at the newly established Ume√• University, where he also became the first dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1966, he was appointed professor of mathematical statistics, a position he held until retirement.Svensk Biografisk Handbok, 1993, p.607 During this time, he wrote papers on survey sampling and the optimum combinations of selected order statistics from various well known parametric distributions, in order to draw inference on population parameters.Google ScholarJagers and Sinha, 2015 Kulldorff was president of the Swedish Statistical Society 1968-69 and 1985‚Äì87, and a member of the Statistics Sweden Scientific Advisory Board from 1988 to 2002. He was president of the Swedish professors union 1978-1980.M Kulldorff, 2015-07-08 =International Statistical Work= A large portion of Kulldorff's work was devoted to the promotion of statistics at the international level. He was a guest researcher at Texas A&M; University (1970), Purdue University (1971), Stanford University (1971), the University of Kentucky (1977), the University of Arizona (1983) and the University of Manitoba (1985). Elected to the International Statistical Institute in 1968, Kulldorff served as vice president of the organization 1981-1985, president elect 1987-1989 and president 1989-1991. Around this time, he made many trips to support statistics in Africa, Asia and Latin America.M Kulldorff, 2015-07-08Biyi Afonja, In His Hands. The Autobiography of a Nigerian Village Boy, 2005, p.392 In 1991, just after their independence, Kulldorff visited the Baltic countries. Seeing a need for knowledge and education about survey statistics, which had been underdeveloped during the Soviet era, he initiated a scientific exchange program between the Baltic and Nordic countries. A few years later, this led to the creation of the Baltic-Nordic-Ukrainian Network on Survey Statistics, with annual conferences, workshops and/or summer schools. In 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from Vilnius University in Lithuania. = YMCA Activities = From an early age, Kulldorff was an active scout and scout leader in Malm√∂ YMCA, leading to a long commitment to the organization.

It became a university in 2011, and was renamed Bristol University. The first graduating class as Bristol was in 2014. The college filed for bankruptcy in 2017. History Bristol was founded in Santa Ana as Kensington College in 1991. In 2009, the school initiated an MBA program. In 2011, the school moved to Anaheim and was renamed Bristol University. The first graduating class of Bristol was in 2014. The school served mostly low-income, international and underperforming students, and a sizable portion of student-athletes. Tuition The school reported the average cost to earn a bachelor's degree from 2014-2017 was approximately $47,400, and took an average of 31 months to complete. Accreditation issues and closure In April 2015, the US Department of Education placed Bristol on a program called Heightened Cash Monitoring, which delays cash payments to universities because they were out of compliance with distance learning regulations. In September 2015, the Department of Education informed Bristol they were no longer eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs, because the school disclosed a material change in ownership twenty five days late.

In honor of his contributions, an agricultural research station was created in Belmonte, Bahia and named after him.  Biography  = Early life = Bondar was born to a family of farmers who owned 5 hectares of land in the village of Malaia Buromca, district of Zolotonosha. There he attended elementary school, graduating in 1892. In 1894, his family emigrated to the department of Yeniseysk, in Siberia. There he has worked for a year as a farmer, being later appointed as a clerk for the municipality. In 1896, he moved to Kansk, where he worked as a clerk at the police department. In 1899, he quit his job and went back to school in Krasnoyarsk, graduating in 1902. Between 1902 and 1905, he worked as Elementary School teacher in Yeniseysk. = Imprisonment and first migration to Brazil = In 1905, Bondar was drafted by the military to fight in the Russo-Japanese War. In the same year, he was arrested for subversive political activities. He gained amnesty with the October Manifesto in the same year, joining an armed uprising in Krasnoyarsk a month later. He was again arrested, escaping on May 20, 1906. He migrated to Manchuria under the identity of Greg√≥rio Kogutovsky, where he worked as a teacher in Hailar District until 1908. In that year, he moved to France to attend the University of Nancy, where he graduated as agronomist in 1910. Unable to go back to Russia, he moved to Brazil. He initially worked as a free-lance photographer, being hired in 1911 as research assistant in the plant pathology department of the Campinas Agronomical Institute. In 1913, he received Brazilian citizenship and was appointed professor of agricultural zoology and entomology at the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture. = Return to Russia = In early 1916, Bondar returned to Russia to fight in the World War I. Before graduating from military school, he was arrested for the 1905 charges and sent to jail in Krasnoyarsk. He received amnesty in 1917, following the Russian Revolution. Being politically moderate, he joined the White movement and was eventually appointed as vice-governor of the department of Yeniseysk. With the defeat of the Provisional All-Russian Government, he was arrested and sentenced to death on December 24, 1919. His sentence was never executed and, in 1920, he was freed on the condition of organizing agricultural defense against a locust outbreak attacking wheat in the southern part of the department of Yeniseysk. On the way to his destination, he managed to escape, initially to Mongolia. = Settlement in Brazil = From Mongolia, Bondar traveled to Manchuria, Korea and Japan. In September 1920, he boarded the ship Chicago Maru towards Santos, in Brazil. In 1921, Bondar was hired by the state of Bahia as an entomologist and plant pathologist in the Department of Agriculture. After settling 1921, he lived in Bahia until the end of his life. In 1932, he was transferred to the Instituto de Cacau da Bahia. In 1938, he was hired as a technical consultant by the Instituto Central de Fomento Econ√¥mico da Bahia.  Research  Bondar has described several new species of palms (Arecaceae). He also published several articles of economic botany of plants in the families Apocynaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Araceae and Arecaceae. His book \\"Palmeiras do Brasil\\" was published posthumously, in 1964, by the Institute of Botany of S√£o Paulo. He has described 318 species of insects, including many pests of the plants he studied. The Bondar collection was acquired by David Rockefeller and donated to the American Museum of Natural History, including his type specimens. Most of his entomological research was published in a series of papers named Notas Entomol√≥gicas da Ba√≠a, published between 1937 and 1950 the journal Revista de Entomologia.

It is located in the city of Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.  History  = Background to the building = Built in 1879 to the designs of William Botterill and Son. It is a brick building with tile and terracotta detail, with dormers and shaped gables. It takes its name from the oriel window on the first floor, the window that stands proud of the facade. The site of Oriel Chambers lies within a much older tenement on the east side of the High Street, in the heart of the historic core of the Old Town of Hull. This particular plot of land was held by Robert de Dripole in 1293. In 1339 the property was split into two, and a deed of that year records a Basement in which a widow lived, with a 9 feet wide passageway or \\"free entry\\" to the west of the said Basement. In the 1347 rental, a tenement was held by John Lambert for 7s per year. A messuage is recorded here in 1374. By 1448 this holding had become one messuage and three tenements, whilst at the Lowgate (Marketgate) end of the property, a chamber and a hospice were erected to serve as a hospital. Renovated interior of Oriel Chambers An example of the architecture within the building Original sanitary provision from 1879 situated on the top floor of Oriel Chambers before renovation work in 2006 In 1455 two new houses were erected on the site, bringing the total to six. Repairs in that year mention a kitchen and a brewhouse. The 1465 Town Rental lists, in addition to the capital messuage and five tenements mentioned earlier, a garden at the end of the tenements which is now assigned to the tenement in Chapel Lane: this almost certainly refers to the east side of High Street. The descent of the property on the east side of High Street is not well documented in the medieval period. The sinuous line of the street suggests that it developed originally as a river frontage for the properties to the west, and that subsequent development of the river bank gradually created a strip of land between the road and the river. Certainly by 1622, no.27 High Street had emerged as a recognisable property in the Elder Chamberlain's Rental. In that year it was held by Robert Williamson, and ‚Äòthe house wherein he dwells‚Äô was specifically mentioned. A single house here continues to be mentioned in the rental returns up to 1711 ‚Äì thereafter the rents for the property are regularly recorded, but no details of the dwelling are mentioned. In 1719 a deed refers to two messuages, with staiths, chambers and Basements on the east side of High Street. In 1673 Robert Nettleton was assessed for five hearths here in the Hearth tax ‚Äì showing that the house was a substantial property. In 1774 Marmaduke Clarke was assessed for 16 windows in the Window Tax ‚Äì once again confirming the size and status of the house. In 1814 Frost and Moxon, rope-makers, are recorded as having premises at 27 High Street, whilst an 1817 document records a Levitt Quarton, merchant here. In 1837 and 1838 Sarah Cole, shop-keeper, had a house and shop on the site. The 1855 Poor Rate records both a house and offices. The 1853 OS map shows a large building on the site prior to the construction of Oriel Chambers. When this building was constructed has not been ascertained. The 1851 directory entry for 27 High Street, lists the occupants as Messrs Hewitt and Ablett, though the entry does not give their trades. By 1858, however, the property was occupied by Henry Fearnley, a shopkeeper and river broker. In 1861, Thomas Thompson, printer and stationer, is given as occupant, though by 1867, another firm of printers, Ash & Co., were in the building, and they are still listed as such in 1876. Architecture in the basement before renovation work in 2006 In 2000 an excavation was carried out by Humber Field Archaeology, to the south-east of Oriel Chambers and immediately to the north of Chapel Lane Staith. The excavation and a subsequent watching brief revealed a number of timber waterfront revetments dating from the late 15th or early 16th century, one of which was largely constructed from reused ship's timbers, the ship having been constructed from trees felled between 1394 and 1404. A chalk wharf surface was also recorded; however, no associated buildings were discovered. During the 17th century the waterfront was replaced, possibly with an open- work jetty. The remains of a number of phases of warehouse showed that the new wharf was in use until that warehouse collapsed in 1861. Extensive remains of the later 19th-century warehouse that replaced it were also present. = Wilberforce Institute = Since 2006, Oriel Chambers has been home to the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation, which acts as a research centre for academics in conjunction with the University of Hull. The patron of the institute is anti-apartheid figure Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the institute was opened by former President of Ghana, John Agyekum Kufuor. Funding was drawn through the European Regional Development Fund, Yorkshire Forward, and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The institute was opened in advance of celebrations marking the bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act 1807 which, through former Member of Parliament and major abolitionist movement figure William Wilberforce, the city of Hull has strong links to. The institute is one of the leading centres specialising in researching the history of slavery, whilst also serving as a research hub concerning contemporary slavery and human rights abuses in the present age. It also aims to foster links with other universities worldwide, including prestigious American institutions such as Yale, Harvard and Stanford. Its exhibitions profile the city's links with Africa, and especially to the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone. As part of the University of Hull, the institute often holds public lectures on the subject of both historical and contemporary slavery, including the annual Alderman Sydney Smith lecture, so named after the former Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull South West, Sydney Smith. In 2014, the institute was a part of 'the Long Walk to Freedom', a series of artworks within the historic Old Town area of Hull, as part of the annual Freedom Festival. In 2015 it was announced that the institute had been awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Further and Higher Education for its 'research applied in combating modern forms of slavery'.  Humanitarian Wall  The WISE 'Humanitarian Wall' commemorates important figures, both historical and contemporary, from the struggle against slavery Described as 'a unique tribute to many of the famous names throughout history which are synonymous with the fight for emancipation and freedom', the Wall displays the names of: *Steve Biko (1946‚Äì77) *Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906‚Äì45) *Thomas Clarkson (1760‚Äì1846) *Frederick Douglass (1818‚Äì95) *William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868‚Äì1963) *Olaudah Equiano (1745‚Äì97) *Mahatma Gandhi (1869‚Äì1948) *Toussaint L‚ÄôOuverture (c. 1743‚Äì1803) *Martin Luther King (1929‚Äì68) *Abraham Lincoln (1809‚Äì1865) *Nelson Mandela (1918‚Äì2014) *Jose Marti (1853‚Äì95) *Edmund Dene Morel (1873‚Äì1924) *Tom Paine (1737‚Äì1809) *Sylvia Pankhurst (1882‚Äì1960) *Rosa Parks (1913‚Äì2005) *Granville Sharp (1735‚Äì1813) *Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811‚Äì1896) *Harriet Tubman (1820‚Äì1913) *Desmond Tutu (1931‚Äì) *Raoul Wallenberg (1912‚Äì47) *William Wilberforce (1759‚Äì1833) The wall faces Mandela Gardens that were opened in May 1983 by Sir Shridath Ramphal. The gardens were named after the anti-Apartheid prisoner Nelson Mandela who later served as President of South Africa. The US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matthew Barzun, was photographed paying his respects at the wall during a tour of Hull in early 2015, also commenting that \\"Wilberforce is a name known around the world and I am sure it is something Hull can use in promoting the city during 2017\\".

PUD can occur in patients of all ages.  Description and procedure  Pyloroplasty is performed while the patient is under general anesthesia and placed in the supine position. The surgery can be performed as an open surgery or by a laparoscope. If performed as an open surgery, the surgeon will make a large surgical incision on the abdomen to open the area, and incise through some of the pyloric sphincter to widen and relax it. A midline incision is most commonly used for this procedure. If performed by laparoscope, 3 to 5 small incisions are made on the abdomen. The abdomen is filled with carbon dioxide so that the surgeon looking through the small camera can see the area. The pyloric sphincter is then widened in the same way as in an open surgery. Pyloroplasty allows for rapid emptying of the contents of the stomach into the duodenum, but may cause reflux of contents of the small intestine back into the stomach. There are multiple types of pyloroplasty techniques. The most commonly performed pyloroplasty is known as Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty. This type consists of a transversely closed longitudinal incision across the pylorus. Another technique is known as Jaboulay pyloroplasty, which is not a pylorus incision, but a side-to-side gastroduodenostomy. Lastly, Finney pyloroplasty is the same technique as Jaboulay pyloroplasty, but also with a pylorus incision. After the surgery, the patient‚Äôs breathing, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, fluid intake and output, respiration, and operative site will be monitored. Typically, about 8 hours after surgery the patient may be able to walk a short distance, and walk increasing distances over the next 2‚Äì3 days. Most patients are released after 24 hours and recover quickly and completely. Most people can slowly begin a regular diet within 2‚Äì3 weeks.  Risks  Risks include those general to surgery, such as reactions to medications, bleeding, blood clots, or infection. Risks specific to pyloroplasty include damage to the intestines, chronic diarrhea, mucosal perforations, leakage of the contents of the stomach, malnutrition, bile reflux, vomiting, and hernias.  Alternatives  Some variants of pyloroplasty are Pyloric dilatation and pyloromyotomy, which are less invasive. Alternative procedures to pyloroplasty include gastrojejunostomy and antrectomy.

Biography Lebedeva was born in 1916, in the village of Bakunin in the Kuvshinovsky District of the Tver Governorate, Russian Empire. Known as Tonya, her family later moved to Moscow, and after finishing school she became a Biology student at Moscow State University. Lebedeva was a member of the Dzerzhinsky flying club in Moscow, and worked her way up to instructor. In 1941, upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union which brought the Soviet Union into World War II, she joined the Soviet Air Force. Lebedeva joined 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, an air defense regiment composed of all- female fighter pilots, and was assigned fight planes of the German Luftwaffe over the city of Saratov. After earning her fighter designation she was transferred to the 434th Fighter Aviation Regiment. From 10 September 1942, she participated in the Battle of Stalingrad defending the skies over Stalingrad until 3 October 1942, when she was transferred to participate in the upcoming Velikie-Luki Offensive. In December 1942, Lebedeva and her wingmate were both shot down shortly after having shot down a German plane, which she survived and quickly returned to fighting. On 10 January 1943, Lebedeva was involved in a dogfight where she faced two German fighters alone, destroying one Bf 109, but her aircraft suffered serious damage in the process and she was forced to make an emergency landing while under attack, landing outside the airport on the fuselage of her aircraft. On 22 February 1943, Lebedeva was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War in the 2nd degree for her courage in battle, and by the time she received the medal had logged nearly 1,500 hours of flight time, having participated in three air battles and made 12 sortie runs. In early May 1943, Lebedeva was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and on 9 May she was transferred to the 65th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment to fight at the Bryansk front. On July 12, Lebedeva was sent to fight in the Battle of Kursk as part of a Soviet offensive. Death During an evening battle on 17 July 1943, while flying a combat mission with 3 other fighters, Lebedeva and her comrades were ambushed by a group of 30 German planes. Lebedeva and her comrades were quickly overwhelmed and shot down, went missing and were presumed dead. In 1982, a group of school children from Oryol were investigating reports regarding the site of a crash in the village of Betovo in Bolhovsky District, Oryol Oblast, when they discovered the remains of a pilot, along with a parachute, pistol, knife and documents. While the aircraft concerned was initially thought to have belonged to the Normandy-Niemen Regiment (a French unit serving on the Eastern Front), the pilot's items recovered were proven to belong to Lebedeva, including her log book and medical card which bore her name. The serial number on the machine gun retrieved from the plane's wreckage was confirmed to belong to Lebedeva's plane at the time of her disappearance. The former commander of the 1st Guards Fighter Air Corps, Lieutenant-General E. M. Beletsky , attended the reburial service Lebedeva, and brought confirmation from archival sources that it was there that Lebedeva's last departure for the combat mission. Lebedeva's grave is now in the former sovkhoz (state farm) of Vyazovsky in Bolhovsky District, where a memorial obelisk was installed as a grave marker.

He held the influential post of head chamberlain (parakoimomenos), with the rank of patrikios, under Michael III (), and perhaps, according to the later Patria of Constantinople, already under Michael's father Theophilos () as well. The Byzantinist Henri Gr√©goire suggested that Damian might be identifiable with the Byzantine admiral, known only from Arabic sources as \\" Ibn Qatuna\\", who led the Sack of Damietta in 853, by interpreting the Arabic name as a corruption of the title epi tou koitonos (\\"in charge of the imperial bedchamber\\"). He belonged to the circle of high officials who opposed Theoktistos, the powerful minister who monopolized power during the first half of Michael's reign. He was instrumental in securing the recall of Michael's uncle Bardas from exile, culminating in the death of Theoktistos and the assumption of control over state affairs by Bardas in 855. In 865, however, he fell out with Bardas, who began scheming against him, and persuaded Michael to dismiss him and have him tonsured. His successor became Basil the Macedonian, the future founder of the Macedonian dynasty. Damian himself retired to the church of the palace of the quarter of St. Mamas. According to the Patria, he also built the monastery known as ta Damianou (\\"Damian's\\").

The Dutch social enterprise is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was founded with the aim to reduce electronic waste (e-waste). It does this by offering users and sellers of phones a way to make their device material- neutral and waste free. The company pays people in emerging markets to collect scrap phones. These phones are then recycled for Closing the Loop‚Äôs customers. The proposition works on a one for one basis, where a customer‚Äôs phone is ‚Äòoffset‚Äô by the recycling of a broken phone. Known customers are T-Mobile, KPMG, the city of Utrecht, Rabobank and the Dutch national government. Closing the Loop buys and collects 'end-of-life' scrap phones in African countries, which are known to be places where many used phones from Europe and the US get a second life. The waste Closing the Loop collects, is recycled in Europe. In this way Closing the Loop turns scrap phones into valuable resources and an income for people in developing countries. Its goal is to prevent mobile phones from ending up in dump sites and at the same time create a more sustainable telecom industry.  Impact  Closing the Loop has saved more than 2.2 million mobile phones from the dump in Africa and gave more than 145,000 mobile phones a second life. Mobile phones are bought from informal local collector networks. To date, Closing the Loop has helped more than 2,000 people in Africa to earn additional income through safe employment. The social enterprise sees e-waste as an opportunity. An opportunity to source companies with responsibly sourced metals, to make industries like telecom circular - by closing loops - and to create income for people in emerging markets. It aims to contribute to the circular economy and the Sustainable Development Goals.  History  Closing the Loop was founded in 2012 by Joost de Kluijver. Joost started with an NGO to make the electronic industry aware of the impact of e-waste. Although all recognized that e-waste was a major problem, the industry clearly needed more than awareness on the topic of e-waste. Joost and his team therefore took own initiative and showed that the metals inside broken mobile phones still have a value as they contain gold, silver, copper and other recyclable metals. Closing the Loop set up a network of collectors in African countries and in 2015 the first container filled with mobile phones was shipped from Ghana to Europe for proper recycling.  Electronic waste  When at the end of their lifespan, scrap mobile phones are often dumped and become a hazard for the environment and human health. For example, in landfills like Agbogbloshie, e-waste is dumped and people try to make a living by burning electronics to extract metals. The fumes that are released are very toxic.

It was named after the heroine of Samuel Richardson's 1741 novel Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded. While Pamela hats and bonnets underwent a variety of changes in shape and form, they were always made from straw. The mid-19th-century version of the Pamela hat was a smaller version of an early 19th-century wide-brimmed style called the gipsy hat. 18th-century origins Henrietta Marchant Liston. A straw hat closely resembling the chapeau √†-la-Pamela as depicted in fashion plates. By Gilbert Stuart, 1800. In 1793, the French actress Mademoiselle Lange, appeared in a stage adaptation of Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded, written by Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau. For the role Lange wore a straw hat which became known as a chapeau √†-la-Pamela, and she is credited with popularising the style. Straw hats √†-la-Pamela were popular for informal wear and widely worn well into the 1810s. In August 1815, La Belle Assembl√©e reported on the continued popularity of the chapeau √†-la-Pamela, worn far back on the head with a tulle and lace cap underneath. Mid-19th century The Pamela hat, which first emerged around 1837, was a version of the gipsy hat with a smaller brim. Gipsy hats were wide-brimmed straw hats worn in the first four decades of the nineteenth century, always with ribbons attached to the crown and coming over the brim to tie under the chin. A variation on the gipsy, where the wide brim was bent downwards by the ribbon ties, was called a witch's hat. In 1837, Pamela hats and gipsy hats were listed separately as fashionable headgear for that year. By 1842 the Pamela hat was described as a \\"half-gipsy hat\\" being made of coarse straw with ribbon trimming, while the Pamela bonnet sloped backwards to reveal the wearer's ringlets. The Pamela bonnet, which was narrow-brimmed with a flat back and trimmed with ribbons and flowers, was fashionable in the 1840s and 1850s. By 1847 Cunnington noted that the Pamela shape was falling out of favour. In May 1856 Godey's Lady's Book described the Pamela hat as a wide- brimmed, flat hat of straw tied under the chin and trimmed with flowers. It was described as a suitable hat for little girls. In March that same year, Godey described the Pamela bonnet as the latest Paris fashion, made popular by a milliner called Alexanche, and published a fashion plate showing how the brim rounded off at the ear like a gipsy hat. By 1858, Godey's were advising readers that the Pamela hat was appropriate only for children, or for wearing on holiday as resort wear. At this time, Godey informed its readers that an alternative name for the \\"Pamela flat\\" was \\"Equestrienne\\". The Pamela bonnet was a fashionable option once again in 1865. In 1872, Gipsy and Pamela hats were both listed as options, both much reduced in size, while larger gipsy hats were known as Dolly Varden hats.

Career Crean worked as an assistant deputy minister in Ontario's Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. = Toronto ombudsman = In September 25, 2008, Crean was appointed as the City of Toronto's first ombudsman for a five-year period. In October 2012, her term was extended by two years. Throughout her term, she shared a sometimes difficult relationship with Toronto city councillors over her sometimes tough reports.  Staffing requests  Crean repeatedly requested additional staff for her office but was repeatedly denied. In 2011, Crean requested more staff for her office, but the city's budget committee declined the request. Crean said the decision would impact her ability to do the job and to remain independent. In 2014, Crean again requested additional staff, citing an increase of 60 percent in the number of complaints made to her office.  Toronto Community Housing  In April 2014, Crean released a report that was harshly critical of Toronto Community Housing chief executive Gene Jones for the hiring and firing practices at the agency. Toronto's then-mayor Rob Ford defended Jones, who he had hired in 2012. On April 25, 2014, Jones resigned from his position.  Rob Ford  Crean released a number of reports that were critical of Ford, starting in 2012. In September 2012, her office released a report complaining that Ford had interfered with the process for appointing citizens to city boards. On October 4, 2012, Crean appeared before Toronto City Council in regards to the report, where she was criticized by a number of councillors for perceived issues with the report. Despite the lengthy questioning, Crean's recommendations were approved 38-0. After releasing a report criticizing Toronto Community Housing chief executive Gene Jones, Ford again called for Crean to resign, saying that the positions of ombudsman, integrity commissioner, and lobbyist registrar should be combined to save money. In April 2015, Crean released a report in which she harshly criticized the now city councillor Ford for his use, as mayor, of city staff as his personal staff, including using security guards to act as his bodyguards and to hide substance abuse issues. Ford released a statement in response complaining about the report.  End of term  In July 2014, it appeared that Toronto might consider hiring Crean for another five-year term. Some media members called for her to be rehired. However, Crean later announced she would not seek an extension on her term of office in March 2015, citing a wish to avoid a potentially acrimonious debate in Toronto City Council as to whether to rehire her.

Early life He was born in Dublin in 1871 to James Gerv√© Conroy, a lineal male-line descendant of Fearfeasa O'Maolchonaire of the Four Masters, and Elizabeth O'Neill, who was the only daughter of Charles Henry (C√°thal Ainr√≠) √ì N√©ill, The O'Neill of Clannaboy. He was brought to St. John's, Newfoundland by his parents at 18 months, where his father became a teacher, lawyer, judge, founder of the Irish Catholic newspaper the \\"St. John's Advertiser\\", two term MHA for Ferryland and the Avalon Peninsula, and advocate of formal political ties between Ireland and Newfoundland. He was educated in St. John's and in London, where he rented a room from Mary, the widow of Dr. Weathers, who was the brother of William Weathers, Bishop of Amyclaw. After returning to Newfoundland, he proposed to Mary's daughter, also Mary, and she and her mother moved to St. John's. He educated William J. Higgins, who would later be his law partner, Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly and a judge.  Career  Conroy worked as a solicitor for the City of Saint John's, and while in that role he launched a writ against the government of Newfoundland to secure funding for the city during the Great Depression. He was Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus and launched a successful but non-punitive libel lawsuit against a citizen who had been misled by the \\"orange\\" element, and was circulating lies regarding the nature of the organisation and a supposed oath, so that future repetitions of the malicious rumours could be prosecuted. He was also Lieutenant-Colonel and commanding officer of the Newfoundland Catholic Cadet Corps. Several pictures survive of him in the Newfoundland archives. He was an avid photographer and salmon fisherman himself, and many of his photographs survive in the Nefwoundland Quarterly Journal, particularly of the salmon rivers of Newfoundland. There is a pool named Chas. O'Neill Conroy's Pool after him in the Salmonier River.  Personal life  An only son, he lived at Raheen at 50 Bonaventure Avenue, and left a large family, with several sons and grandsons serving the executive of the Benevolent Irish Society of St. John's. The eldest, James O'Neill Conroy, married Elizabeth Anne McGrath, daughter of James Francis McGrath, whose sons included James M. McGrath and John William McGrath, Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary who was with him at the assassination attempt on him. Jim and Betty had a boy Padre Carlos O'Neill Conroy, who was a Priest in Monsef√∫ and for a time made mayor before he died tragically in 1966 in an auto accident, and a girl Sister Margaret O'Neill Conroy who still teaches in Uganda O'Neill Conroy Family Tree - descendants of Elizabeth O'Neill Family tree of the O'Neill Conroys of Newfoundland and Canada, descended from Elizabeth O'Neill.

Theophanes Continuatus reports that he was still young, but an experienced and capable commander. Since the late 9th century, the fleet of the Muslim frontier emirate of Tarsus in Cilicia had been a major threat for Byzantium. In Hexamilites' time, the city of Tarsus had come under the control of the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla. Despite his disposing of fewer ships, Hexamilites led his fleet against the Tarsians, sinking many ships with Greek fire‚Äîwhich may indicate that his forces had been augmented with ships from the central Imperial Fleet‚Äîand inflicting many casualties and taking many prisoners. According to the Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir, this action took place in September/October 956 and cost the Tarsians 1,800 dead. This victory was crucial for Byzantium, as it crippled the Tarsian fleet and opened the way the expedition to recover Crete, led by Nikephoros Phokas, in 960‚Äì961.

He was the head of the Mirtola Ashram located in the village of same name, near Almora, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. He published several articles on the topics of agriculture and ecology of India. He was also the author of four books, What is Man?, Man, The Measure of All Things, Man, Son of Man and An Open Window. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992 for his contributions to the agriculture sector in India.  Biography  Sri Madhava Ashish was born Alexander Phipps, on 20 February 1920 at Edinburgh to a Colonel working in the British Indian Army and his early schooling was at Hove and Sherborne. Later, he studied aeronautical engineering at Chelsea Polytechnic and joined Royal Air Force to be based at Doncaster and at Brooklands, Surrey. When World War II started in 1939, Phipps was deputed to India, at a glider manufacturing unit near Dum Dum airport, Kolkata where he is reported to have been engaged in the repairs of Supermarine Spitfire engines. The turning point in his life reportedly came when, on a vacation in 1944, he had the opportunity to visit Sri Ramana Ashram of Ramana Maharshi, at Tiruvannamalai and known to have come under the influence of the renowned Indian sanyasin. When the war ended the same year, he stayed on in India to continue his spiritual searches. Assisted by Esther Merston, the author of Village Life By the Ganges, he moved to Mirtola Ashram, a spiritual base at the foothills of the Himalayas, near Almora district, in the Kumaon valley. Since then, the ashram, founded in 1929 by Sri Yashoda Mai (full monastic name: Sri Krishna Sevika Sri Sri Yashoda Mai Vairagini) (married name: Monica Devi Chakravarti) (n√©e Monica Roy) (1882-1944) and Sri Krishna Prem (1898-1965), remained his home till his death in 1997. At the ashram, Phipps submitted to the way of life there, turned into a vegetarian Vaishnav sanyasin, and practised meditation. He also took up the name of Madhava Ashish. When, Sri Krishna Prem, then head of the ashram, died in 1965, he became the head and oversaw the management of the institution till his death. He also involved himself with ecological and environmental issues and started experimenting with agricultural techniques which he passed on to the local farmers. Under his stewardship, the ashram became self-sufficient with own agricultural, dairy and poultry farming. His work is also known to have influenced the government to introduce agriculture as a subject of instruction in the schools in the region. He wrote several articles on agriculture and preservation of ecology. He also wrote three books, What is Man?, Man, Son of Man and An Open Window and co-authored Man, the Measure of All Things, along with Sri Krishna Prem, the sanyasin he succeeded as the head of Mirtola Ashram. The book was started by Sri Krishna Prem but Ashish completed it and the book narrates the life and times of Helena Blavatsky, the co-founder of the Theosophical Society of India. His involvement with agriculture and ecology earned him memberships in many committees of the Planning Commission of India. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992. Five years later, Ashish died on 13 April 1997, succumbing to cancer, which had been troubling him for some time. He left behind an unfinished book, the biography of his mentor, Sri Krishna Prem. His life has been the subject of many writings and Masters Speak: An American Businessman Encounters Ashish and Gurdjieff recounts the experiences of Seymour Buddy Ginsburg (b. 27 August 1934), an American businessman and the founder president of Toys R Us, US based children's goods retailer, had with Ashish, during his visit to Mirtola. Guru by Your Bedside: The Teachings of a Modern Seer is a Penguin India publication by Satish Datt Pandey (b. 1930), a biographical account of Ashish which includes details about Mirtola and its spirituality.

The book was published on June 23, 2015 by the British think tank Institute of Economic Affairs, and was also released in Stockholm in co- operation with think tank Timbro. The foreword is written by American libertarian author Tom G. Palmer.  Synopsis  In the book, Sanandaji argues that particularly the left has long praised Scandinavian countries for their high levels of welfare provision and admirable societal outcomes. Although true that Scandinavian countries are successful, the author makes the case that this success pre-dates the welfare state. According to Sanandaji Scandinavians became successful by combining a culture with strong emphasis on individual responsibility with economic freedom. This can also explain why Scandinavian Americans, who live outside Nordic welfare states, have low levels of poverty and high levels of prosperity.  Reception  In the International Business Times, Ian Allison writes that Scandinavian Unexceptionalism shows that \\"many desirable aspects of Scandinavian societies, such as low income inequality, low levels of poverty and high economic growth pre-dated the development of a generous welfare state\\". American economist Tyler Cowen wrote that the book \\"has many points of interest\\", quoting a paragraph about the success of Scandinavian migrants to the United States. Allister Heath, deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph, wrote that the book shows how the \\"remarkable work ethic\\" of Scandinavians has been eroded by large welfare states over time. Swedish economist Gabriel Sahlgren wrote that the book neglects to show that the \\"smaller welfare state development prior to the great expansion from the 1960s onward\\" was important for the development in Scandinavia. The book has received international attention, mainly through various free-market think tanks. On 29 June 2015, it appeared as the front- page article of French-language newspaper L'AGEFI, published in Switzerland. In The New York Post, Rich Lowry wrote: \\"There are a couple of things wrong with the Left‚Äôs romance with these countries, as Swedish analyst Nima Sanandaji notes in a recent monograph. It doesn't fully appreciate the sources of Nordic success, or how Scandinavia has turned away from the socialism so alluring to its international admirers\\". In The Boston Globe, Jeff Jacoby commented: \\"In Scandinavian Unexceptionalism, a penetrating new book published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, Sanandaji shows that the Nordic nations' prosperity 'developed during periods characterized by free-market policies, low or moderate taxes, and limited state involvement in the economy'\\".

The goals of the movement were to stop increases in student fees as well as to increase government funding of universities. The movements were started and led by the SRC leader of the University of Witwatersrand of 2015, Shaeera Kalla. On 2 October Kalla attended her last council meeting as SRC president, she is accompanied by Nompendulo as an observer heading towards being the incoming SRC President of 2016. Protests started at the University of Witwatersrand and spread to the University of Cape Town and Rhodes University before rapidly spreading to other universities across the country. The 2015 protest ended when it was announced by the South African government that there would be no tuition fee increases for 2016. The protest in 2016 began when the South African Minister of Higher Education announced that there would be fee increases capped at 8% for 2017; however, each institution was given the freedom to decide by how much their tuition would increase. By October 2016, the Department of Education estimated that the total cost in property damage due to the protest since 2015 had amounted to R600 million (equivalent to US$44.25 million).  Background  The protests followed a three-day student lock-down of the University of Witwatersrand campus the week before following an announcement by the university that fees would be increasing by 10.5% in the following year despite an inflation rate of only around 6% for the same year. The university's chief financial officer stated that the cause of the high increase in fees was: Although the focus of the protests was focused on a rise in fees a number of factors formed the background for the protests from a lack of funding for poorer students to attend university, high incomes for University managers, a real decline in government funding for higher education, lack of social transformation, to broader socio-economic and racial inequality issues. The vice chancellor of the University of Witwatersrand Adam Habib estimated that if government could provide an extra R8 billion per year \\"that will cover the tuition fees of every student at every university in the country.\\" South Africa spends 0.75% of its GDP on tertiary education which is less than the African or world average. Timeline 2015  = 12‚Äì19 October = Students at the University of Witwatersrand started protesting on 14 October 2015 in response to an announcement by the university that fees would be raised by 10.5%. This led to a sit in and lock down of the university by students and some staff that, on 17 October, resulted in the university agreeing to suspend the fee increase and renegotiate it as well as not seek disciplinary action against participating students or staff members. On Sunday 18 October messages started circulating on Facebook about a possible complete shut down of the Rhodes University campus. = 19 October = By Monday 19 October fresh negotiations between students and the university had begun. On the same day similar protests had spread to the University of Cape Town and Rhodes University. On the same day management at the University of Cape Town -which had announced a 10.3% fee increase the week before- applied for and received a court interdict to prevent protests at the university. Students started blocking vehicle access by placing rocks, dustbins, and benches on the roads leading into the campus. Students went ahead and led by the Rhodes Must Fall movement occupied the university's administration building. Riot police were called to forcibly evict the protesters with over 25 students being arrested late at night. Reportedly over a thousand students then gathered at the Rondebosch police station and held an all night vigil calling for the students' release. At Rhodes University students reportedly started barricading themselves into the university and forcibly turning away others from entering the campus. Students at the University of Pretoria reportedly initiated plans to lock down three of that university's campuses for Wednesday 21 October. = 20 October = Students from the University of Cape Town marching to the local police station on Tuesday 20 October 2015 to demand the release of other students arrested the night before. On Tuesday 20 October students assembled at the University of Cape Town and marched down to the local police station to demand that the students that were arrested the previous night be released. The Cape Peninsula University of Technology students started protesting and locked down the campus. At the Fort Hare University students also began protests and a campus lock down. They refused to disperse or write exams until university management had dealt with concerns over fee increases and issues of corruption. Students at the University of Stellenbosch handed over a memorandum of grievances to university management outlining their complaints whilst students at Rhodes University continued their protests. At the University of Witwatersrand students rejected a proposed compromise by the university to cap fee increases at 6% and instead demanded that there be no increase in fees. = 21 October = On Wednesday 21 October 2015 students from both the University of Cape Town as well as the Cape Peninsula University of Technology formed a crowd of around 5,000 protesters marched on the South African Parliament which coincided with the meeting of the National Assembly -with both Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande and President Jacob Zuma in attendance- which was in session to hear the medium-term budget. Following the finance minister's address, Nzimande tried to address the crowd but was repeatedly booed by the crowd whilst President Zuma left the Parliamentary buildings from a side entrance. Other parliamentarians were advised by the speaker of the house to wait out the protests in their offices. Protesters broke through the gates of the parliamentary precinct and began to stage a sit-in protest, but riot police soon moved in to disperse them using stun grenades, tasers, coloured gas, riot shields and truncheons. After the riot police had cleared the precinct of protesters and shut the gates, police warned protesters that they were contravening the National Key Points Act and that if they do not disperse with in 15 minutes, they will be arrested. The protesters did not leave, and police went ahead and arrested a number of them. It was claimed that protesters identified by police as particular troublemakers were arrested. The presence of riot police was questioned by the press. Mass meetings at Stellenbosch University were held on the same day to demonstrate against fee increases. Protest action also started at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth, when students blocked the main roads onto the Summerstrand campuses. At least one altercation with the police took place when tear gas and rubber bullets were used to push students back onto campus. =22 October = The University of Johannesburg experienced protests, during which an altercation between students and private security guards took place. Students at Fort Hare University lit bonfires at the university's entrance and vandalised the campus security offices. In Johannesburg students marched on the ruling African National Congress's (ANC) headquarters at Luthuli House where students handed over a memorandum to ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe. Protests continued in Cape Town with students gathering at the central magistrates court to witness the court appearance of the 29 students arrested during protests outside Parliament the day before. Despite assurances by NMMU management that classes would resume on 22 October 2015, protesters continued action. This included disruption of some classes that staff and students attempted to attend. A meeting was due to take place at a stadium on campus, but this was not attended by students, partly due to rumors on social media that there was a heavy police presence at the stadium. Students then insisted that Vice-Chancellor meet them where they had gathered, which he refused to do, citing safety concerns of a large number of people at that location. Following the meeting, students moved to block vehicle access to campus, which lasted until approximately 18:00, trapping some staff and students on campus. = 23 October = In the United Kingdom a group of around 200 students gathered at Trafalgar Square in front of South Africa House to show support of protesting students in South Africa. A Cape Town daily newspaper, the Cape Argus, invited student co-editors to edit the day's edition of the newspaper. Articles were written, commissioned and edited by the students involved in the #FeesMustFall protest. Classes at NMMU were cancelled, and student protesters continued blocking entrances to campus. This was followed by a peaceful movement to another campus (2nd Avenue). During the morning university vice chancellors and student representatives met with President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria to negotiate a way forward. Whilst they were meeting, a large group of protesting students assembled outside the Union Buildings to await Zuma's response. A small group turned violent, setting fire to a portable toilet and breaking down fences. The police responded with tear gas, stun grenades, and rubber bullets. The students themselves called for discipline, stressing it was a peaceful protest. Shortly after 3 pm, President Zuma announced from within the Union Buildings that there would be no increase in university fees in 2016. Whilst this was a major victory for the protest, protesters were upset that the president chose not to address them directly. A number of students tried to storm the Union Buildings demanding to address Zuma. Police responded with force, using rubber bullets. After being driven out of the Union Buildings, students continued to protest in the streets. One consequence of the #FeesMustFall movement was the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training. by President Jacob Zuma launched the commission's probe in January 2016, the reported goal being to report on the feasibility of providing free tertiary education.  Costs  The South African Department of Higher Education and Training calculated the damage caused to universities during the 2015 #FeesMustFall protests to R300 302 848.58, with the North West University's Mahikeng campus having suffered the most damage at R151m due to unrest that saw buildings torched, students shot at with rubber bullets and the university closing for a month. 2016 Revival and #FeesMustFall2016 In mid-August 2016, the Minister of Higher Education and Training was widely expected to announce fee structures for the 2017 academic year. This led to a revival of the fees must fall campaign under the hashtag #FeesMustFall2016. = August =  10 August  Led by Honourable Justice Jonathan Arthur Heher, a former judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal, the Fees Commission began set 1 of the hearings. It included submissions and testimonies from student representatives and unions. 12 August The Council on Higher Education concluded that a 0% fee increase would be unsustainable and recommended an inflation-related increase for South Africa's universities in 2017. 14 August Calls were made on social media for students to shut down universities on 15 August. These purportedly came from the South African Union of Students. Later in the day Minister for Higher Education, Blade Nzimande called for calm stating that no decision had (yet) been reached about fees. Meanwhile, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe reaffirmed the National Executive Committee's prevailing policy of no fee increases at South African universities. 15 August Protests at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and Mangosuthu University of Technology over the purported fee increases lead to the suspension of the academic programmes at those universities. Police were deployed to some other universities in anticipation of protests. Blade Nzimande reiterated that no decision had been reached over fees for 2017. 20 August Protests broke out at Walter Sisulu University's iBika campus in Butterworth and Nelson Mandela Drive campus in Mthatha. Hundreds of students blocked the N2 in both towns and are reported to have thrown stones at vehicles. Police in Mthatha responded with teargas and several students were arrested in Butterworth. South African president Jacob Zuma instructs Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to \\"find the money\\" to ensure a 0% increase in 2017. This came despite National Treasury's warning that this was unaffordable and Nzimande's earlier position that universities needed at least a 6% increase to avoid \\"collapse\\". The students conducted a feasibility study with an independent source and it was found that R60 Billion was lost in corruption annually and that free education at the same standard as it is paid (facilities, lectures etc.) would only cost R45 Billion annually. 23 August During protests at the University of Witwatersrand a cleaner died as the result of an apparent asthma attack. A fire extinguisher was released in Jubilee Hall at the university campus. The cleaner was taken to hospital and discharged and treated. After discharge from hospital the worked passed away. 25 August Pravin Gordhan is reported as saying that if corruption could be addressed, South Africa could afford to cover university fees for students from poor backgrounds. This came shortly after outgoing rector of the University of the Free State, Jonathan Jansen told a press conference that he believed that there was no hope for South African universities.  6 September  A group of students disrupted the Fees commission hearing and blocked University of Cape Town (UCT) vice-chancellor Max Price from leaving the venue. =19 September= The University of Cape Town suspended its academic project in anticipation of an announcement on the fees situation by Minister Nzimande. At 11AM Blade Nzimande announced that university fees would increase in 2017, but increases would be capped at 8%. He emphasized that university councils would make the final decisions about fees. However he went on to say that the government was still engaging with stakeholders to come up with a way to provide financial assistance to students with annual family incomes of below R600,000. As an immediate response, students at the University of Witwatersrand mobilised to shut down their campus, blockading entrances. The protesters claimed that all protest would be peaceful; however, they turned to violence when vehemently denied entrance to the Great Hall by heavily armed riot police. Concrete objects were destroyed and pieces were thrown at security guards who were defending the hall. The students were demanding \\"free decolonized education for black people\\". This was purportedly followed by students at University of the Free State and University of Pretoria. = October = On 10 October students at the University of Witwatersrand gathered at the Great Hall, an area on the campus. The students were denied access to the hall by private security. They were soon replaced by the South African Police Force. In order to disperse the protesters the police fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and smoke grenades. 2 students were injured and 11 were arrested by police (recorded at approximately 11:00). By the afternoon the students started throwing rocks. One bus was allegedly burnt by students, but no proof was found.http://ewn.co.za/2016/10/10/Bus-set-alight-during-Wits-protests Students at the University of Pretoria picked up rocks and put them in bins as a sign of peace. On 19 October two security guards were allegedly attacked on the University of Cape Town campus during a protest with video evidence published by a number of news sites. The guards were allegedly beaten with steel rods taped with masking tape and also beaten with their own batons while in another alleged incident a rock was allegedly dropped on a security guard's head, resulting in hospitalization of the security guard. On 25 October vehicles were set on fire by allegedly by protesters at the University of Cape Town. Later that year protestors disrupted the University of Cape Town's Convocation Annual General Meeting during which campus food stall owners alleged that Fees Must Fall protestors had threatened them with violence during the protests. = Reactions = The 2016 protests saw the movement lose momentum, due to alleged sabotage by the PYA (an alliance of the leading party, the ANC) and internal divisions. In response to the protests the South African government increased the amount budgeted for higher education by R17-billion over 3 years and stated that government subsidies to universities would increase by 10.9% a year. The protests also increased the use of blended learning by South African universities to assist non-protesting students complete their courses. On 7 December the University of Witswatersrand announced that it would be increasing student fees by 8%.  Police Brutality  During the #feesmustfall protests, Police brutality on students reached an all-time high, many newspaper sources were even quoted saying that it reminded them of the Sharpville Massacre. Police who were deployed at the University of the Witwatersrand during this time did not hesitate to use brutal force on students.The Journalist Police used stun grenades, rubber bullets, teargas and water cannons to disperse students on the East side of the campus. While students remained calm, three days into the 2016 protest, students reacted to the police brutality and started throwing rocks at the police.Daily Maverick Arthur Muhamelwa who was part of the logistics team behind the movement was one of those targeted by police in 2016 where they drove him around for hours interrogating him about the movement and the whereabouts of other student leaders such as Shaeera Kalla, Mcebo Dlamini and Fasiha Hassan. #Feesmustfall leaders (in both 2015 and 2016) were all shot with rubber bullets and in particular the outgoing SRC president of 2015, Shaeera Kalla, was shot 9 times with rubbet bullets at close range when she turned her back on police at the forefront of protests last year.GroundUp During this heightened period of brutality against students, the police denied these allegations of targeting student leaders. South African Police Spokesperson stated that police were reminded to \\"exercise maximum restraint and act within the limits of the law.\\" On 18 October 2016, it was said by students demonstrating at the University of Witwatersrand, that police officers were targeting leaders to weaken the movement. there alleged claims of students being abducted, abused and then dumped into Limpopo. Wits student Arthur Muhamelwa was arrested by police on Sunday, who proceeded to abduct him. Police drove him around for hours, whilst student leaders looked for him at Hillbrow, Jeppe and Cleveland police stations. the Student representative (SRC) council started #WhereIsArthur on Facebook. Arthur realised he was in some danger, he typed in an SMS seen by Daily Maverick, \\"Something here is not right, i'm still on a moving police quantum passing a board written Bela Bela and Polokwane and a board written welcome to Limpopo.\\" this was just before 20:00 on Sunday evening. the Police proceeded to strip Arthur naked as well as torture him. he was then abandoned by the police Near a river in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. This and many other allegations were made by students and student leaders, who were adamant that the police was targeting leaders and intimidating them to quiet down protests. The Police force denied all allegations. Brutality was a big topic for debate since the general public either claimed the students were to blame due to their unprovoked violence, therefore giving police authority to use force, or the police were to blame, apparently using force while being unprovoked by students, resulting in student violence and destruction.  Student Violence  Alleged incidents of student violence against security guards were recorded during the protests, with security guards allegedly beaten and an incident occurring where a rock was allegedly thrown by a student on a security guard's head, resulting in hospitalization. A worker at the University of Witwatersrand died during the protests due to an apparent asthma attack as a result of a fire extinguisher being set off on campus. Cases of intimidation of staff and non-participating students during the protest movement were recorded.  Legacy  The initial impact of the protests was to prevent any raise in university tuition in 2016. The protests resulted in the guarantee by national government of free higher education for students leading to the creation in 2018 of a national bursary scheme for poor and working class students totalling R12.4-billion in 2018 with the bursary budget expected to increase to R24.3-billion in 2020. A study by the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation concluded that the decolonisation focus of the 2016 protests was less successful than the 2015 protests; however the study concludes that the protests did bring the subject of decolonisation of educational institutions and the alienation of black students and staff from university life to broader public attention.url=https://www.csvr.org.za/pdf/An-analysis-of-the-FeesMustFall- Movement-at-South-African-universities.pdf The protests were estimated to have cost around R800 million in damages to educational infrastructure. Family members of University of Cape Town Professor Bongani Mayosi stated that the \\"vitriolic character of student engagements\\" during the protests by protesting students led to the decline in Mayosi's mental health resulting in his suicide in 2018. The movement along with #Rhodesmustfall has been criticised by the Institute of Race Relations for eroding freedom of speech in South African universities by promoting intolerance of alternative points of view, with pro- FeesMustFall activists taking actions ranging from shouting down non- supporters to acts of intimidation and violence. A number of people involved in the #feesmustfall protests (most notably Naledi Chirwa, Vuyani Pambo, Peter Keetse and Dali Mpofu) were registered as Economic Freedom Fighters party representatives for the 2019 South African general election. The 2019 film Everything Must Fall documents the 2016 FeesMustFall protests.

Classic Game Room  Originally titled The Game Room and presented by Bussler and David Crosson, the video game review series launched on November 7, 1999 on the internet startup website FromUSAlive, part-owned by Michael. The pair had met at Pittsburgh Filmmakers School and shared a mutual love of movies and video games. At first, Bussler and Crosson planned to review mainly then-modern games, but after a segment on older games proved to be popular, the show began reviewing earlier titles. However, the low-budget nature of the show led to slow episode production rates, and when revenue failed to cover the costs of running the show, The Game Room was canceled on October 23, 2000. The show returned as Classic Game Room HD (HD standing for Heavy Duty according to Bussler)Loaded Cartridge Interview with Mark Bussler on February 20, 2008, hosted by Bussler. On November 2, 2015, Bussler announced that the show would highly slow its production following the end of the 2015 year. Changes would include the shutting down of the show store and its secondary channel CGR Undertow entirely ending production. Bussler stated that this is due to a change in his life and he would like to focus more on his writing and film-making. He also said that he would continue the show as a hobby similar to how it began for him. Bussler later opened a Patreon for the series at the recommendation of fans in order to keep the series operating as normal, but would be renamed Classic Game Room Mark 3. On February 5, 2019, Bussler announced he'd be moving away from games and video production, in favor of writing and graphic design.https://twitter.com/ClassicGameRoom/status/1092878184780103682 The show was finally cancelled in April.

Early life  Donald Bruce Kaufman was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1922, the third child of immigrant parents from Russia. His father was a finish carpenter and his mother was ill most of her life with tuberculosis. Donald was moved around to live with different family members most of his young life.  Career  At the end of World War II he joined the Air Force and became a cadet. Though he never saw action, he did learn to fly an airplane. After his service, he gathered some of his friends and started a business framing houses in Detroit. He later started a contracting company he called ABCO, named so as it would be the first company listed under contractors in the telephone book. The business received a lot of work after the Korean war, with men returning to the States and needing homes for their growing families. He later renamed the business Cordell Construction Co. In 1957, Kaufman joined with Eli Broad and co-founded Kaufman & Broad, now known as KB Home (NYSE: KBH). With limited resources, Kaufman handled production, purchasing quality, and material control and Broad did the financial detail and administration work. Kaufman also devised a method to build homes on cement slabs, which enabled the firm to make a heavy impact on the Detroit market at a time of dwindling demand and high competition for home buyers. The company expanded to Arizona in 1962 and into California in 1963 and was the first U.S. homebuilder to expand into France in 1967. In 1965, the Detroit News noted: \\"Detroit‚Äôs building boom has brought Donald Kaufman out of semi- retirement and back from California to lend a strong hand to the business that started here and grew into a nationwide, multi-million dollar operation in only eight years.\\" Detroit News went on to state how Kaufman could build a three bedroom house with a basement in the cold winter, plowing thru the ice in Detroit Michigan and on the seventh day, customers were talking to the salesmen while walking through a new, furnished home. Several years later Kaufman eliminated basements and built the new houses on cement slabs. This lowered the cost of the homes and Kaufman and Broad became the most successful home builders in the United States and France. Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation went on to become the first publicly traded home building company on the NYSE.  Personal life  In 1954, Kaufman married Glorya Kaufman (Pinkis). They had four children, Laura, Gayl, Curtis and Stacie. Donald and his son-in-law, Eyal Horwitz, both died in a plane crash January 4, 1983. He is survived by his wife, four children, ten grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. In 1994, Glorya Kaufman, family members, and friends made donations for the construction of the 10,040-square-foot Donald Bruce Kaufman branch of the Los Angeles Public Library in Brentwood, Los Angeles.

Lal Bahini was headed by Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League President Abdul Mannan. The force was basically a vanguard of the then Bangladesh Awami League and was used to suppress uprising among the workers. The actual date of the formation of the force is unknown. This wing of Bangladesh Jatiya Sramik League was never recognized by the government as an official force, but in a public speech Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called them his Red Horses. Lal Bahini was dreaded for its ruthlessness in suppressing labor protests in the industrial areas of the country including Tejgaon, Tongi, Adamjee, Kalurghat etc. as well as for fueling riots in the industrial areas. Lal Bahini, Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini and Shecchashebak Bahini formed an unholy nexus during the Sheikh Mujib regime. Lal Bahini is responsible for hundreds of riots that took place in three years that claimed thousands of lives.  Background  Bangladesh became independent after a nine-month-long Liberation War of Bangladesh. After the return of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on January 10, 1972, he directed to draft a constitution for the country which was adopted with four fundamental principles of state policy- Democracy, Socialism, Bengali Nationalism and Secularism on November 4 of the same year. These four state policies are called Mujibism all together. The Awami League, which claimed to have been committed to establish a socialist economic structure, on March 25 nationalized all the banks, insurance, factories and mills which were previously taken over by the government after the enactment of Acting President Order 1. Almost 80 to 85 percent industries of the country came under the effective control of the government. As a result of the acquisition of the industries, along with the administrative power the government also got the responsibility of the welfare of the labors who have been working in those industries. This made the Awami League's labor wing to be more dominative than ever. Under government support Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League soon became a major force in politics and formed the voluntary force Lal Bahini that started working from 1972.  Ideology  Although Lal Bahini members had a little headache about the ideology and it was primarily formed to wipe out opposition forces from the industrial areas around the country, the public speeches of its leadership and its activities during the regime indicate that the force may have been considered themselves as revolutionary vanguards indeed and actually adopted Vanguardism as its ideology. In the context of Marxist revolutionary struggle Vanguardism professes the idea that only one party can truly represent working class. After the October Revolution, Bolsheviks played the role of being the representative of working class. Lal Bahini aimed at ensuring only one representative of the working class which would be the Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League. It was neither the largest nor the most popular labor organizations of the country. After the 1973 election, in which Bangladesh Awami League won a decisive victory, the labor front launched a campaign to drive out all other trade union leaders and workers from the industrial areas of the country. According to the Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League leaders: In addition after the industries were nationalized in March, 1972 the Lal Bahini chief Abdul Mannan declared that the force was created to help the government to establish socialism and economic emancipation of the working class. Moreover, Lal Bahini men were motivated by the anti-American speeches which made them to build an anti-American mindset. On May 3, 1973, leaders of Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League and Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni accused Jute Mills Corporation chairman of \\"smuggling out jute to agents of US imperialism, Zionism and Pakistani capitalists sitting in New York\\". Bangladesh Textile Workers League, a wing of the parent organization of Lal Bahini, requested for aid from the United States of America in an application signed by its General Secretary Mahbubul Alam on May 16, 1973.  Formation  The exact date and time of the formation of Lal Bahini could not be determined since it was entirely a voluntary force backed by the ruling party and there was no certain table of organization of establishment for the force. Abdul Mannan who was the head of Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League seemed to have orchestrated the formation of the force. After the resignation of two powerful labor leader Mohammad Shahjahan and Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan from the organization, Abdul Mannan tightened the grip as he became not only the all-in-all of the labor group but also the only one in the organization.Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡¶§‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ì ‡¶™‡¶§‡¶®‡¶É ‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø, First published 2015, p. 89, Prothoma Prakashani, Dhaka Lal Bahini, to eliminate their political opposition, whom they used to describe as 'bad elements', from the industrial hubs, launched a purification drive from March 1972 after the policy to nationalize the industries was declared. Lal Bahini leaders openly declared crusades against the organizations those were, according to them, involved in anti-government protests backed by United States of America. In a public meeting that took place in December 1972, extending his support for the purification drive of Lal Bahini, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman threatened to deploy his 'red horses' to finish off the so-called exploiters.  Rivalry  Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League had developed rivalries with almost all other labor wings of the country during the regime but it got a fresh blow after the formation of Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (Jasad) on October 31, 1972. Of the most influential trio of the Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League, Mohammad Shahjahan and Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan left the organization in support of the newly formed Jasad with their thousands of followers in December that apparently compelled the only leader left in the organization Abdul Mannan to reorganize the organization. Mohammad Shahjahan and Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan formed a new labor front of Jasad. From the beginning, Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League had rivalries with the Jasad supported Jatiyo Sramik League and even Abdul Mannan of Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League was found saying, \\"if the new front pronounce a single word against Mujibism I will cut off their tongue\\".Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡¶§‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ì ‡¶™‡¶§‡¶®‡¶É ‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø, First published 2015, p. 90, Prothoma Prakashani, Dhaka Moreover, the Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League in many of the industrial areas failed to create a strong support base due to the influence of left-wing Bangladesh Sramik Federation over the labors working there. Bangladesh Trade Union Kendra (Center) BTUK which was backed by the Communist Party of Bangladesh also had influence over the working class.  Atrocities  = Mongla Port Massacre = The first ever atrocity initiated by Lal Bahini took place in the port of Khulna which is popularly known as Mongla Port where thousands of workers used to work as porters. It was assumed that the massacre might have occurred as a result of the competition for establishing dominance over the porters between left wing labor fronts and the Bangladesh Jatio Sramik League. The massacre escalated from a riot that was ensued in March 1972, among the two groups- Lal Bahini and the leftist laborers. The massacre started when the police got involved in favor of Lal Bahini to wipe out the opposing labors. As a result of the confrontation according to the official statement of the government, some 36 labors were killed. But the actual toll was far bigger than the number stated by the government. According to prominent journalist Anthony Mascarenhas who was in Bangladesh during the riot, some 2000 people were killed that day and the leftists labor wings who dared to confront the armed to teeth Lal Bahini men paid the toll.Anthony, Mascarenhas, Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood, First published 1986, p. 25, Hodder and Stoughton, London, = Tongi Violence = Another dreadful incident was the April 5 attack by Lal Bahini men on Bangladesh Sramik Federation workers in Tongi industrial area. The attack was aimed at the end of the influence of NAP (Bhashani) supported federation workers in Tongi who were the largest among the labor organizations of Bangladesh during those days. Thousands of workers were assaulted, tortured and an unidentified number of workers were killed in the attack of the armed cadres of Lal Bahini. Lal Bahini cadres expelled a huge number of labors who used to support the Bangladesh Sramik Federation. After the order was restored, victims rushed into Dhaka, and met the Prime Minister to protest. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assured that the justice would be ensured soon but no steps were taken. However, after the incident, the Lal Bahini declared their determination to expel the wrong type of elements from the industrial areas of the country. = Riots in Chittagong = Lal Bahini along with some government officials was directly responsible for the riots in the Kalurghat industrial area and the R.R. Jute and Textiles Mill of Chittagong. The prime reason behind these riots was the 'local and non-local issue' and the 'districtism' which was introduced by the Lal Bahini men and was used to differentiate the workers. Since Chittagong was a port city and was an industrial hub, many workers had to come Chittagong in search of work from the other districts. They were working for years in those factories and contributed to the production of the factories. During May 1973, the Lal Bahini members initiated a purification campaign using the local-non local issue. Workers who were not from Chittagong were killed en masse in the riots. Hundreds of workers were slaughtered and the survivors fled to other districts for life. Factories were closed. A number of riots ensued eventually and the production of the mills significantly declined. Prior to these riots Sheikh Moni and Abdul Mannan addressed their followers and Lal Bahini contingents and alleged that the jutes were smuggled to imperialists by some agents. They had pledged a purification movement. The increasing number of riots created a tension among the government and the Finance Minister Tajuddin Ahmed in a press conference on May 12 said that the production is harshly declining and the economy is on the point of collapse. He called for tighter labor discipline in factories and all out efforts to increase production. = Fazlur Rahman abduction = Lal Bahini chief Abdul Mannan on April 30, 1973 sent his henchmen to raid the home of Ahmed Fazlur Rahman, who was a co-accused, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in the Agartala Conspiracy Case. He owned a small chain of petrol stations and other small-scale businesses. The Lal Bahini abducted him and took him to the Sramik League office. There he was harshly interrogated about the source of his income and property. Once Sheikh Mujib came to know about the abduction, he ordered Mannan to let Fazlur Rahman go. After Mannan complied, Sheikh Mujib assured Fazlur Rahman that suitable steps would be taken against Mannan, but he remained at liberty until arrested in January 1975 for misappropriation of funds.

A SEPR 844 at the Mus√©e Safran SEPR 844 For simplicity of fuel supply, the TX2 fuel of the SEPR 841 was replaced with standard Jet TR-0 / JP-4 / JP-5 (kerosine) in the SEPR 844.  Mirage  The Mirage and its distinctive delta wing planform began with the prototype MD 550 Myst√®re-Delta. This bore little relation, other than its name, to the Dassault Myst√®re; France's swept-wing fighter of the period. The delta aircraft was smaller, around two thirds of the Myst√®re's weight and was powered by two small Viper turbojets and a SEPR 66 liquid-fuelled rocket. All three of these engines barely exceeded the thrust of the Myst√®re's ATAR 101D, although they also only weighed about half of the ATAR. = Mirage IIIC = The Mirage III adopted the more developed and afterburning ATAR 9. As the delta wing considerably increased the supersonic capacity of the aircraft, rocket power was retained. This was the first European aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in level flight. It was recognised that most mission profiles did not require the rocket and could not afford its fuel consumption. The original goal of intercepting high-flying bombers also seemed to be receding in favour of missiles, for both offence and defence. The Mirage's rocket was thus mounted as a removable pod which could be replaced with a jet fuel tank for additional range. Only the high altitude interception would still use it. To retain balance as rocket fuel was consumed, the rocket pack was in two parts. The nitric acid oxidiser tank was mounted directly ahead of the rocket engine. A smaller TX2 fuel tank was mounted just behind the cockpit, replacing the cannon pack. When in the rocket-powered interceptor role, the aircraft would only be armed with missiles. The fuel tank and rocket pack could be swapped in around 20 minutes by removing six bolts. Fuelling the rocket oxidiser was potentially somewhat hazardous and so it was carried out away from other aircraft, by groundcrew in protective clothing and with a fire crew standing by in order to flush away any spillage. Acid refuelling was carried out above a steel drip tray, with the acid flow and tank vent return through closed pipework with a sightglass to observe full tanks. Performance in training sorties achieved Mach 1.4 without the rocket and 1.8 with. Altitudes of could be reached in a zoom climb, or on rocket thrust. A typical training sortie duration of 45 minutes would be reduced to under 30, with high Mach and rocket use.

Developed after an urban design competition in the 1980s, and built in five phases during the 1990s, it was the first new construction in the urban renewal of this part of the Port of Hamburg. Parts of the Hanseatic Trade Center along Kehrwiederfleet complement the historic Speicherstadt, while its western end at Kehrwiederspitze features two high- rise structures.  Overview  The Columbus-Haus The HTC at Kehrwiederfleet The Hanseatic Trade Center comprises a total floor area of . It is located on the western tip of HafenCity, surrounded by water on three sides. To the north, Binnenhafen separates it from Hamburg's Altstadt (old town), to the south it is facing Sandtorhafen and HafenCity proper. Public transport is available at Baumwall station, just across Niederbaumbr√ºcke. During construction and the first years after, the five buildings were named by order of development phase.

It is a species of stingless bees that practices obligate nest robbing. They have never been spotted foraging from flowers, an observation that supports their raiding behavior. Because of their lack of hind corbiculae, they must raid to obtain enough protein in their diet in the form of pollen and nectar. Lestrimelitta limao secrete a lemon-scented alarm allomone, from which they receive their name, in order to conduct successful raids. L. limao are hypothesized to produce poisonous honey that is toxic if consumed by humans. Because robber bees are so rare and difficult to observe, there is a limited scope of information available. Taxonomy and phylogeny Lestrimelitta limao is part of the Apidae family, which consists of bumble bees, euglossines, honey bees, and stingless bees. This species is within the tribe Meliponini. L. limao usually visit the nests of the same family, most notably, Trigona. Description and identification The Lestrimelitta limao species is divided into the workers, males and queens within each colony. Males are about the same size as workers, but the queens are noticeably larger. All members of the species are of shiny black coloration with hairs sparsely found on the body and densely found of the femora and tibiae. The hairs on the tibiae are short and yellow, while the sparse body hairs are black. The wings of L. limao contain barely noticeable cubital veins. Additionally they are identifiable by their lack of a functional worker corbiculae, elongated gut, fewer olfactory discs, and through their unique cleptobiotic behavior. A L. limao colony is generally composed of guards, workers, and scouts that all work towards raiding neighboring stingless bee colonies. There is no job specialization according to age. =Queens= The queen of Lestrimelitta limao will mate with multiple males. While there is one gravid queen, there are typically two or three virgin queens within a colony. The queen has longer and more robust legs than the workers or the males as well as a more developed malar space. While their wings are similar is shape and structure to workers, queen wings contain four to five hamuli. Gravid queens range from nine to 10.5 millimeters in length while virgin queens are approximately seven millimeters in length. =Workers= Each L. limao worker wing usually contains five or six hamuli. Workers range from 5.5 to 6.25 millimeters in length, about two mililmeters in width, and five to 5.5 millimeters in forewing length. =Males= The males are slightly smaller than workers, having smaller heads, wider eyes, shorter malar space, and a narrower facial quadrangle. The flagellum of the male is made of 12 joints, and is actually londer than that of the cospecific worker. While the queen and workers have six visible tergites, males have seven. Males range from 5.5 to six millimeters in length, about two millimeters in width, and 4.5 to five millimeters in forewing length.Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Volume 90, New York 1948, p. 181-187 =Nest architecture= Lestrimelitta limao nests are primarily built elevated off the ground. The surface of the nests remained a thin soft layer, but during repair, an involucrum forms in which old architecture is built over using new structures. Workers use building material acquired from raids of nearby stingless bee nests. Numerous blind sac elongate protuberances of 1-1.5 cm in height and diameter are built all over the surface. There is high variability in these protuberances due to a lack of integration of individual activities of the workers during nest repair. Within the nest, there is usually large entrance tube that can extend up to 35 cm. This entrance tube contains stalactite-like protuberances on the underside of the nest. Researcher observed the constant smoothness and roundness of the interior of the flight tube. This main entrance is sealed using a waxy resin substance to prevent intruders from entering at night. Depending on the weather, guard bees will situate themselves in the inner margins of the nest entrance, or directly outside of it. The presence of an entrance tube is common in stingless bee nests and can be found in many species, such as tetragonisca angustula, to help protect the nest. Distribution and habitat Lestrimelitta limao are found in Brazil and Panama and are considered a rare and dispersed species. Their nests can be found high up, in hollow tree trunks, but have occasionally been seen a foot off the ground or along the sides of walls. Lestrimellita limao colonies will strategically build their nests within 10 feet of other meliponine nests to make nest robbing more manageable. Raiding behavior As obligate nest robbers, Lestrimelitta limao must visit neighboring nests to fulfill its nutritional needs. Usually, a host nest would be occupied for about 4 hours, but occasionally, a raid could last a maximum of 5 days. During the rainy season, there is a greater recurrence of raids due to the lower abundance of flowers. Mass raids involve up to 600 L. limao bees, while mild raids for nest material involve only a few. It is possible for multiple meliponine colonies may be raided simultaneously. On occasion, L. limao may evict or exterminate the original inhabitants of the host nest. Though instances have been recorded, raiders will rarely take permanent possession of the stores within the nest and the nest itself. =Scouting= Lestrimelitta limao scouts leave to gather information about potential victims at nearby meliponine nests. These workers have large cephalic gland reservoirs of citral and chemical isomers. These chemicals are liberated when they are killed at the host's nest entrance, recruiting the scout's nest mates. The release of these chemicals is what attracts more L. limao workers, initiating the raid. =Guarding= At their own nests, guards are not aggressive, but at the entrance of host nests, they form a circle in order to defend it from the hosts and from other insects. Lestrimelitta limao guards surround the outside of hosts nest, aligned side-by-side, before and during a raid. These guard ring robbers occasionally raise their abdomens, exposing their whitish intersegmental region and fan their wings. They release citral from their mandibular glands, an act that must be well timed relative to the progression and initiation of the raid. =Workers= Workers place small pieces of resin over the entrance holes to prevent ants and the hosts from entering the entrance tube during the raid. Once the raid is complete, they remove the seal. Human importance =Production= While bees of Lestrimelitta limao colonies have never been observed on flowers, they have been seen on poisonous plants. It is possible that the honey of L. limao causes illness and paralysis and has therefore been deemed toxic. In 1895, it was cited that the people of Alto Parana of Misoines use the same amount of honey produced by the ‚Äúirati‚Äù (the culture‚Äôs name for L. limao) to treat the same paralysis that it causes. Similarly, in 1930 Nordenskioid cited the Guarayu Indians of Bolivia‚Äôs use of the honey to cure paralysis. The accounts of the effects of L. limao honey on different persons suggests that the honey may contain grayanotoxins and cause mad honey disease.

Their debut single, \\"In2\\", was released on 20 July 2015, and peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Louis Rei was formerly known as LB, Akelle was formerly known as A-Star and is Haile's cousin. Haile has featured on several tracks as a solo artist, including \\"Can't Blame Me\\" by Nines. Background WSTRN consists of Akelle Charles, Haile and Louis Rei. The name bears no relevance to westerns; according to the band, the name represents positive vibrations and to them means that it is \\"West London's turn to shut down the scene\\". Akelle and Haile are cousins who know Louis, a former footballer who last played for Staines Town F.C., through their inhabitance of West London, while Akelle is the brother of singer Angel and was part of a band with him and his three other siblings called the Charles Family, co-managed by the late reggae singer Smiley Culture and Akelle's father, Tendai Charles, who was in the same reggae group as Haile's father. Rei's father is Gary Beadle. The group failed to achieve mainstream success despite being the subject of a BBC documentary One Life. Akelle Charles had two main followers, which were his nephews, who encouraged him to keep producing songs as well as the will to be signed. Career =2015‚Äìpresent: Formation and \\"In2\\"= Their debut single, \\"In2\\", was released on 20 July 2015, through Link Up TV and came together as a result of a jam session, instrumental first; Akelle and Haile had written a track and had asked Louis to feature on it. It was recorded in one of the group's first sessions and has appeared on the Radio 1Xtra and Kiss FM playlists. Two music videos were produced for the song ‚Äì the first was pulled after the band signed to Atlantic Records, while the second was produced by Sally Sibbet and sees the group loitering across West London. Prior to the release of the latter video, Atlantic Records pulled down 43 unofficial YouTube and SoundCloud links before its submission. On 30 October, \\"In2\\" debuted at number 85 in the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart, and climbed to number 60 on 6 November, the day of its digital download release. For these two weeks, it charted on streams alone. Upon its digital release, it peaked at number 4 on 13 November 2015, earning the group its first top 40 and general chart entry. On 2 December 2015, the trio released the song \\"Got Love\\", produced by Parallel (a collective made up of Akelle's brother, Angel, and PRGRSHN). The song was available to download for free when subscribing to their mailing list, and was also released via digital retailers on 4 December. The group expressed via Twitter that the song was not a single. According to Clash Music, the song is about \\"appreciating the simple things in life\\". On 28 July 2018, Akelle was convicted alongside his brother of violent disorder following an attack on a 60-year-old woman and a 40-year-old man in their own flat. He received a -year sentence of imprisonment.

From January 2008 to December 2009, a pilot project with basic income grant was implemented in the Namibian villages of Otjievero and Omitara. The project was organized by the Namibian Basic Income Grant Coalition. It was mainly funded by a German Protestant church, by individual contributions of German and Namibian citizens and by contributions of the German Ministry for Cooperation. The amount paid out per head was N$100 (8% of the average income, around US$12). After the launch, the project was found to have significantly reduced child malnutrition and increased school attendance. It was also found to have increased the community's income significantly above the actual amount from the grants as it allowed citizens to partake in more productive economic activities. The project team stated that this increase in economic activity contradicts critics' claims that a basic income would lead to laziness and dependence. After the conclusion of the pilot project phase, a monthly bridging-allowance of N$80 (around US$10) was paid regularly to all who participated in the pilot until March 2012. One of the conclusions of the project was that, even with the restriction that only residents of the village for over a year since the pilot's start could benefit from the grant, there was a significant migration towards Otjivero-Omitara, despite the fact that the migrants wouldn't receive the grant. The project concluded that this phenomenon reveals the need to introduce such basic-income systems as a universal national grant, in order to avoid migration to particular regions, towns or households. Another finding of the project was that after the introduction of the pilot, overall crime rates fell by 42%, specifically stock theft, which fell by 43% and other theft by nearly 20%.

The UBI proposal in India is framed with the intent of providing every citizen \\"a basic income to cover their needs,\\" which is encompassed by the \\"universality\\" component. \\"Unconditionality\\" points to the accessibility of all to the basic income, without any means tests. The third component, \\"agency,\\" refers to the lens through which the Indian government views the poor.

It is paid to all citizens and replaces the subsidies of petrol, fuel, and other supplies that the country had for decades in order to reduce inequality and poverty. , the sum corresponded to about 40 U.S. dollars per person per month, 480 U.S. dollars per year for a single individual and 2,300 U.S. dollars per year for a family of five people. The initial public and political reaction to the program was negative. Local press claimed that the poor were abandoning their jobs due to the extra money, and the Government has considered introducing means testing to reduce the costs of the program.Hamid Tabatabai, IRAN : Basic Income Might Become Means Tested A first assessment of the experiences in Iran was provided in 2011 by H. Talabani.The Basic Income Road to Reforming Iran's Price Subsidies, in: Basic Income Studies vol. 6, #1. Another assessment published in 2017 found no evidence of cash transfers recipients reduced their participation the labor force.  Iraq  According to Aminah al-Thahabi, who writes for Niqash, most political groups, including political parties in the Parliament have adopted a position on the issue. Proponents of the basic income argue that the system would end the oil curse and that all Iraqis with this kind of system would be able to get a fair share of the country's oil resources. Opponents argue that the reform would be inflationary and that oil money would be better spent on infrastructure, especially since much of this is still in disastrous condition after years of sanctions and war. Johnny West, OpenOil consultancy, estimated that Iraq could introduce an annual basic income of 220 U.S. dollars per person in October 2012 and then level could increase with increased production. He also argues that Iraq has such great natural resources that poverty could be abolished in two years.USBIG NEWSLETTER Vol. 13, no. 64 Spring 2012 (Read 2 December 2012) Europe =Belgium= Historically in Belgium, the most active group promoting basic income is the movement Vivant and the philosopher Philippe Van Parijs, who founded the Basic Income European network (BIEN) in 1987. A Belgian basic income network affiliated to the BIEN was founded in 2012 in Brussels =Bulgaria= The \\"European Citizens' Initiative for Unconditional Basic Income\\" was a citizenship initiative in the European Union 2013, with the aim to collect one million signatures, and by that force the Council to consider basic income carefully in the EU, and to make a basic income report. The national campaign in Bulgaria for this initiative got support from \\"The Artist Union of Bulgaria\\", \\"The Bulgarian Music Association\\", \\"The European Anti- Poverty Network\\" (Bulgaria), Citizens' Movement \\"DNES\\", \\"Zona Lovech\\", \\"The Bulgarian Association of the Economists\\" and the \\"CITUB\\" trade union. The \\"Bulgarian National Radio\\" also joined as a media partner and \\"Metroreklama\\" granted the right to advertise the Initiative in all metro stations and trains. With all this organisations backing up the initiative Bulgaria eventually reached its national quota of signatures, and even more than so, 230 percent. In December 2014, one year after the European basic income initiative, Bulgarian Union for Direct Democracy, a new party, was created. Besides direct democracy the party also included basic income in its program.Bulgarian Union for Direct Democracy in Bulgarian language. =Czech Republic= The first bigger discussion on universal basic income in the Czech Republic was initiated by philosophers and social scientists Marek Hrubec and Martin Brabec. Later, they published with Philippe Van Parijs a book \\"V≈°eobecn√Ω z√°kladn√≠ p≈ô√≠jem. Pr√°vo na lenost, nebo na p≈ôe≈æit√≠?\\" (\\"Universal Basic Income. Right to Laziness, or Right to Survival?\\"). In 2013, activists and social scientists joined the European Citizens' Initiative for Unconditional Basic Income,European Citizens' Initiative for Unconditional Basic Income and have created a campaign to support unconditional basic income. In the Czech Republic, unconditional basic income is supported by many individuals, NGOs (Alternativa zdola, ProAlt, Lev√° perspektiva, for example), and political parties. It is the program of the Green Party, the Communist Party, the Pirate Party, and the Party of Democratic Socialism. It is also supported by many Social Democrats. =Finland= In the 1970s, Finnish researchers were inspired by Milton Friedman's proposal for a negative income tax. In 1994, Osmo Soininvaara wrote a book advocating basic income.Osmo Soininvaara, \\"Hyvinvointivaltion eloonj√§√§misoppi\\" (A survival doctrine for the welfare state), Juva, WSOY, 1994, 298 p, The Young Finns advocated basic income in the 1990s. The Centre Party began advocating liberalization of labor markets and basic income in the end of the 1990s. In 2003, the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy published the book \\"Kansantalous 2028\\" (\\"Economy 2028\\"), which concluded that a basic income and a flat income tax rate would be a good solution. In 2007, Kansallinen sivistysliitto published the paper \\"Sis√§ll√§ vai ulkona ‚Äì kohti perustuloa?\\", which advocated basic income. In 2007-2011, the centre-right government was interested in adopting a basic income system. However, the SDP and trade unions affiliated with the party were aggressively opposed to basic income.Osmo Soininvaara: SATA-komitea - miksi asioista p√§√§tt√§minen on niin vaikeaa? (2010) In 2013, Libera Foundation published a detailed proposal for Life Account (\\"perustili\\"), a savings account that allows owners to withdraw money (up to a monthly maximum) even if their balance is negative. Everyone would receive the account at the age of 18 and the initial balance would be 20,000 euros. The initial balance would replace the current student grant system. Life account would resemble basic income. In 2014, the Centre Party as well as the Left Alliance and Green League, expressed support for basic income. In May 2015, the Sipil√§ Cabinet committed to carrying out a Basic Income experiment as part of a government program. In November 2015, Kela, the Finnish Social Insurance Institution launched a preliminary study to identify the model for implementing the experiment. In 2018, Finland ended the universal basic income experiment. The experiment was temporary. =France= The French region Aquitaine, where a basic income pilot will take place, according to a decision in the regional council.Jourdan, Stanislas French Regional Council of Aquitaine to assess feasibility of basic income pilots July 9, 2015 (read October 30, 2015) The debate in France started in the 1970s but as elsewhere in Europe it took a long time for it to become a major political issue. However, in 2015 the regional parliament in Aquitaine voted for an implementation of some kind of basic income experiment. In January 2016, the Conseil national du num√©rique, a public Advisory body on Digital Affairs released a report which recommends to examine and experiment basic income. The Europe Ecology - The Greens party are the most prominent political party which supports basic income.  Advocates  Some of the most well-known defenders of basic income in France are Benoit Hamon, Yoland Bresson, Andr√© Gorz, Baptiste Mylondo, Yann Moulier Boutang,Jourdan, Stanislas. The collaborative economy is destroying jobs. So what's next? , OuiShare.net, October 2012 Toni Negri, Jean-Marc Ferry, Ignacio Ramonet, , Christine Boutin, Dominique de Villepin, Karima Delli, Jean Desessard and Yves Cochet. The think tank Centre des Jeunes Dirigeants (CJD) (\\"Young policymakers trust\\") also call for a basic income of 400 euros per citizen, per month.Michel Meunier: \\" La France a les moyens d‚Äôavoir un vrai syst√®me de solidarit√© \\", revenudebase.info, December 2012 The CJD's and Christine Boutin's basic income proposals are based on Marc de Basquiat financing model,Marc de Basquiat, Modeling basic income in France: from incentive effects to amount of payment ‚Äì on the factual issues of the basic income which demonstrates a way of financing a basic income of about 500 euros for every adult and 250 per child, while other advocates such as Baptiste Mylondo and Jacques Marseille promote a \\"high enough\\" basic income, around 750 euros. However, unlike Mylondo and Marseille, De Basquiat's model doesn't reduce any pension, housing or unemployment benefits.  Opinions  In 2015, an opinion poll suggested that 60% of the population was in favor of a basic income. =Germany= G√∂tz W. Werner, a German proponent of basic income. The debate about basic income started to grow in the 1980s when groups of unemployed people came out in favor of the reform.Ronald Blaschke The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections (accessdate=13 December 2012) For many years the idea was only supported openly by some academics, such as Claus Offe, and a few politicians and organizations. However, after the Hartz reforms, introduced by the Cabinet of Gerhard Schr√∂der in 2003-2005 and subsequently modified, a debate regarding basic income was triggered.Van Parijs, Philippe Personal reflections on the 14th congress of the Basic Income Earth Network (read December 13, 2012) 2009, Susanne Wiest, a house wife, made a presentation in the German Parliament about the basic income petition she had initiated and which received support from 52,973 people. 2010 there were several basic income demonstrations, the biggest in Berlin. 2011 the Pirate Party decided to advocate for a basic income alongside minimum wages.GERMANY: Pirate Party endorses Basic Income in its national campaign (read December 13, 2012) Among the political parties in Germany, the Pirate Party officially endorsed basic income in 2011. Inside the Christian Democratic Union, Dieter Althaus proposes a basic income model. A group led by Katja Kipping also promotes basic income inside the leftist party Die Linke. Also, within the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Rhein- Erft-group favors basic income since 2010. Within The Greens there are also many advocates. In 2016 the Basic Income Alliance was formed, a single-issue political party that advocates for a universal basic income. A commission of the German parliament discussed basic income in 2013 and concluded that it is \\"unrealizable\\" because: * it would cause a significant decrease in the motivation to work among citizens, with unpredictable consequences for the national economy * it would require a complete restructuring of the taxation, social insurance and pension systems, which will cost a significant amount of money * the current system of social help in Germany is regarded as more effective because it is more personalized: the amount of help provided depends on the financial situation of the recipient; for some socially vulnerable groups, the basic income could be insufficient * it would cause a vast increase in immigration * it would cause a rise in the shadow economy * the corresponding rise of taxes would cause more inequality: higher taxes would cause higher prices of everyday products, harming the finances of poor people * no viable way to finance basic income in Germany was found =Greece= Though the idea of basic income is not well known in Greece, several economists have worked on the topic. In 2010, the liberal party Drasi supported a proposal for a basic pension scheme, aiming at simplifying the hundreds of pension schemes in a country being hurt by the debt crisis and pressured by the troika to balance its public budget. Manos Matsaganis and Chrysa Leventi co-authored a study that demonstrate the feasibility of such a proposal.Manos Matsaganis & Chrysa Leventi (2010)Pathways to a universal basic pension in Greece Other heterodox proposals suggest that a Greek exit from the eurozone could be an opportunity to implement a \\"monetary dividend\\" for every Greek citizen as a way to manage the financial collapse of the country.Stanislas Jourdan, \\"A monetary approach towards an unconditional basic income in Greece,\\" 14th BIEN Congress (Munchen 2012). =Hungary= Unconditional basic income is endorsed in Hungary by the FNA Group (formed in 2011) and the Hungarian Pirate Party. In 2014 the L√âT workgroup published a proposal, which involved paying 50,000 HUF per month to every adult and 25,000 HUF to every child; 90% of the cost would have been covered by rearranging existing social welfare, the rest by a dedicated new tax. The proposal received no significant political support. =Iceland= In October 2014 the Icelandic Pirate Party put forth a parliamentary resolution calling on the Minister of Social Affairs and Housing and the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs to appoint a workgroup to conceive ways to ensure every citizen an unconditional basic income. The Pirate Party currently holds 6 out of 63 seats in the Icelandic Parliament. =Ireland= The chief advocacy group is Basic Income Ireland, a member of BIEN. Social Justice Ireland has produced a fully costed proposal for 2012. Before that, the main advocate was CORI (Conference of Religious of Ireland), one of the social partners. Politically, the Green Party favour a basic income. As part of the agreement with the social partners including CORI, a green paper on Basic Income was published by the Irish government in 2002, but there has been no movement on a government level since then. In 2013, during the European Citizen's Initiative campaign, six MEPs from the Republic of Ireland signed a statement in favour of Basic Income. =Netherlands= The issue of the basic income gained prominence on the political agenda in Netherlands between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s. In 2015 it was announced that the city of Utrecht and its local university will be conducting an experiment on basic income. Local authorities are planning to encourage other municipalities to engage in similar experiences. =Norway= The Norwegian Green Party, Norwegian Red Party, Democrats in Norway and the Norwegian Pirate Party endorse basic income in Norway. The Liberal Party of Norway formerly endorsed a basic income guarantee in Norway, but dropped it from the platform before the 2013 election. The NGO BIEN Norge, affiliated with Basic Income Earth Network works to promote the system in Norway. =Slovakia= The Freedom and Solidarity party advocates a Contribution Bonus, which is a basic income system with a flat tax. It claims that this would streamline the system and cut unnecessary expenses and bureaucratic overhead. =Spain= Since 2001, the Red Renta B√°sica is the national network affiliated to the BIEN. It gathers researchers and activists for basic income. From 2011 to 2012, the 15-M Movement also contributed a lot in spreading the idea among the Spanish society, and political parties as Partido Andalucista in Andalusia and Podemos introduced it as one of its proposals. In 2015, a citizen's initiative received 185,000 signatures, short of the required amount for the proposal to be discussed in parliament. Famous Spanish advocates of basic income include Daniel Raventos, David Casassas, and Jos√© Luis Ley. According to Economy Minister Nadia Calvi√±o, Social Security Minister Jos√© Luis Escriv√° is coordinating a universal basic income project to help counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the scheme is expected to be rolled out indefinitely. The scheme was approved by cabinet on 29 May 2020. =Switzerland= The association BIEN-Switzerland (affiliated to the Basic Income Earth Network) promotes basic income in the francophone part of Switzerland. In the German-speaking part of Switzerland a group called \\"Initiative Grundeinkommen\\" is very active in promoting basic income.News, Generation Grundeinkommen. Retrieved 6 September 2013.  The basic income referendum  In 2008, Daniel H√§ni and Enno Schmidt produced The Basic income, a cultural impulse, a movie that explains and praises the idea of a basic income. With more than 400,000 views, the movie went viral and contributed a lot in spreading the idea among French and German speaking countries. In April 2012 a popular legislative initiative was launchedAn Initiative to Establish Basic Income for All, Global Voices which aimed at introducing basic income in the Swiss Federal Constitution. The campaign successfully collected enough signatures (126,000) by October 4, thereby triggering a nationwide popular referendum in 2016, making Switzerland the first country where people were consulted by referendum on this issue. The proposal would have given 2500 francs monthly to every adult and 625 francs to every child. The government estimated the costs to be 208 billion francs per year, most of which could have been covered by abolishing the existing social security system, but the last 25 million francs would have been only possible to collect by tax raises. The trade union Syna brought its support for this initiative, but none of the political parties supported the proposal, and both the federal government and the National Council of Switzerland (lower house of parliament) called on the people to reject the proposal by referendum. The main arguments against basic income before the referendum, as interpreted by Martin Farley:Farley, Martin The lessons from the Swiss basic income referendum The Transformation Deal. 2016 * It was a risky experiment * It was a utopian fairy tale with no basis in reality * It would result in inflation if adopted * The Swiss are not poor, so a basic income is not really required * Switzerland already has a very good and effective system of social welfare, so it does not need to be replaced * People should earn their income, not just receive it * The proposal was prohibitively expensive and would require a huge increase in tax * There was no plan in place to fund it In the end, the proposal was overwhelmingly defeated with almost 77% voting against it. =Ukraine= Though the idea of basic income is not promoted by the government, different tech companies develop and adopt the ideas of unconditional basic income. The most well known example is the Nimses concept. Nimses has a time-based currency called nim (equals to 1 minute). Every person that joins the system receives 1440 nims per day that can be spent on different goods and services. =United Kingdom= Guy Standing, a British basic income advocate. Basic Income has been discussed and advocated for in United Kingdom for much of the 20th and 21st century. It started with the writings by Bertrand Russell, Major C.H Douglas, and Dennis Milner around 1920 (with little if any interaction between them). In 1946 the UK implemented Family Allowances, an unconditional income for the second and subsequent children of every family, and during the mid-1970s this became Child Benefit; an unconditional income for every child. In 1982, Brandon Rhys Williams MP proposed a Basic Income to a parliamentary committee, in 1984 the Basic Income Research Group (now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust) started work, and from 2014 onwards the debate started to take off, among think tanks and academics, in the print and other media, and among some Members of Parliament. Some parties are pro-basic income, most notably the Scottish National Party, which at its spring 2016 conference backed the principle of a universal basic income to replace the current welfare system. Other parties supporting it are the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party, and the Scottish Socialist Party. On 16 February 2016 Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said that a basic income policy was under consideration by the Labour Party. In August 2018, he said that Labour hoped to include a proposal for a pilot scheme in its next manifesto. Guy Standing is perhaps the most well known contemporary advocate of the idea. In his book The Precariat - the new dangerous class, he blames globalization for having plunged more and more people into the precariat, which he analyses as a new emerging social class.Britain's labour figures hide the real hours we work every day, The Guardian, 2012 He concludes on the necessity for \\"governments to provide basic security as a right\\" through a basic income. Other advocates include Edward Skidelsky and Robert Skidelsky, who argued for basic income in their book called How Much is Enough?, Malcolm Torry who is Director of the UK Citizen's Income Trust, Louis Haagh, chair of the Basic Income Earth Network, and Annie Miller who co-founded Citizens Basic Income Network Scotland. North America =Canada= William Aberhart, premier of Alberta, was inspired by Major C. H. Douglas Social Credit theory and tried to implement a basic income for Albertans during the 1930s. However, he was thwarted in his attempts by the Federal Government of the time.P. Mulvade, James Basic Income and the Canadian Welfare State: Exploring the Realms of Possibility University of Regina (read 29 January 2013) The city of Dauphin, Manitoba, Canada, took part in an experimental guaranteed income program (\\"Mincome\\") between 1974 and 1979.Vivian Belik (5 September 2011). A Town Without Poverty? The Dominion. Retrieved 27 August 2013. In November 2013, a poll commissioned by the Trudeau Foundation found that 46% of Canadians favored and 42% opposed replacing current economic assistance with a guaranteed national income. Starting in 2014, the Liberal Party of Canada, the Green Party of Canada, the Pirate Party of Canada, provincial party Qu√©bec Solidaire, \\"Qu√©bec solidaire pr√©sente des propositions audacieuses pour combattre les in√©galit√©s,\\" Qu√©bec solidaire (14 aout 2012). and conservative senator Hugh SegalSenator Hugh Segal on basic income , Basic Income News have been advocating for basic income in Canada. Mike Redmond, leader of the New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island, has supported a basic income pilot project on Prince Edward Island. In 2017 the Liberal Government of Ontario announced that in 2017 they would launch the Ontario Basic Income Pilot Project in the cities of Hamilton, Lindsay and Thunder Bay. Selected residents will receive CAD$17,000.https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot In 2020, the government of British Columbia explored the idea of a basic income to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. =United States= Arguably, basic income was invented in the United States by Thomas Paine, who outlined something similar using arguments very similar to those of modern basic income advocates, but it was the English writer, Thomas Spence, who‚Äîwriting in response to Paine‚Äîfirst outlined a complete basic income proposal in 1797. The United States has experienced three distinct waves of support for basic income in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first half of the century various people advocated it in different forms including Louisiana governor Huey Long who called it \\"Share Our Wealth\\" and some followers of Henry George. The second wave of support for basic income in the United States rose during the 1960s and fell almost as quickly in the late 1970s. At the time, there was a big debate in the United States regarding poverty and how to deal with it. One of the solutions that came up during this time was some form of guaranteed income, mostly in the form of a negative income tax but sometimes in the form of basic income. In 1968, James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements. Milton Friedman endorsed the negative income tax in 1962 and again in 1980,Frank, Robert H. \\"The Other Milton Friedman: A Conservative With a Social Welfare Program,\\" The New York Times (23 November 2006). and he connected his support for the negative income tax to support for basic income in an interview with Eduardo Suplicy in 2000. Martin Luther King, a famous civil rights activist and politician, also gave his support for the idea in his book Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?, published in 1967.Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community? (New York: Harper & Row, 1967)Jordan Weissmann (28 August 2013). Martin Luther King's Economic Dream: A Guaranteed Income for All Americans. The Atlantic. Retrieved 30 August 2014. In 1969, Richard Nixon proposed a \\"Family Assistance Program\\" which resembled guaranteed income, in that benefits did not rapidly taper with additional earnings by the beneficiaries. Nixon's proposal only applied to families, but extended previous welfare by benefiting more than those without a 'father'. Other advocates from the 1960s and 1970s include Senator George McGovern who called for a 'demogrant' that was similar to a basic income.\\"How Mark stands on the issues\\" Gravel presidential campaign, 2008 The most often noted outcome of the second wave of basic income support in the United States has been the four basic income experiments (see below) conducted by the U.S. government at the time but arguably expansions of Food Stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit and creation of the Alaska Dividend (see below) were all outcomes of the debate. Discussion of basic income or any form of income guarantee drop off considerably in the United States after 1980, but the academic debate grew gradually through the 1990s and 2000s. The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network (the USBIG Network) was founded when six academics including Fred Block, Erik Olin Wright, and others met at the Kiev Diner in New York City in December 1999. The group held its first Congress in 2002 and has held one each year since. The yearly events have been renamed the North America Basic Income Guarantee Congress and now take place in Canada on even years and in the United States on odd years. Partly as an outgrowth of the USBIG Networks conference, a bill for a modest basic income was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives under the name \\"the Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act,\\" based on a proposal coauthored by Al Sheahen. Following the 2009 financial crisis, and the increase political attention to the issue of inequality brought on by movements such as Occupy and the 99 Percent, brought new interest to basic income, which was furthered by influence from basic income trials conducted in Namibia and Indian and petition drives (citizens initiatives) for basic income in Switzerland and the European Union. Discussion has picked up every year to the point where mainstream political actors are regularly talking about basic income for the first time since the 1970s. A small amount of third-wave basic income support has come from the right of center, it appeals to people who think of it as a way to streamline and simplify the welfare system while making it more cost effective, and perhaps saving money. Mike Gravel talked about a tax rebate paid in a monthly check from the government to all citizens as part of a transition away from income taxes and toward a pre-bated national sales tax (the FairTax), which was also endorsed by Mike Huckabee. Libertarian advocates include Charles Murray, Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center, Matt Zwolinski, and a group called \\"Bleeding Heart Libertarians.\\"Danny Vinik (20 November 2013). Paul Ryan Should Get Behind This Plan To Give Everyone Free Money. Business Insider. Retrieved 28 January 2014. But although conservative and libertarian support was a central part of support for the negative income tax in the 1970s, it remains a small part today. But far more of the contemporary support for basic income in the United States has come from the left of center, driving by people who see it as a major expansion of support for low-income people, as the late, Al Sheahan argued in his 2012 book, the Basic Income Guarantee: Your right to economic security. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has argued forceful for basic income. The Green Party of the United States in its 2010 platform advocated for a universal basic income to \\"every adult regardless of health, employment, or marital status, in order to minimize government bureaucracy and intrusiveness into people's lives.\\" The Occupy Movement and Black Lives Matter have both endorsed basic income. Many climate change activists, such as Peter Barnes, propose a Citizen's dividend as part of their strategy to put a price on the depletion of resources. Many technology experts and technology entrepreneurs have begun endorsing basic income in the 2000s and 2010s. These include Marshal Brain, Sam Altman, James Hughes, Facebook co- founder Chris Hughes, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg (in his 2017 Harvard commencement speech), and Jeremy Rifkin. The overriding theme among technologists who favor basic income is the belief that automation is creating an increasingly unstable labor market. Rifkin in his book The End of Work, argued not only that the labor market is less stable but also that automation would reduce the total demand for workers in future. Labor leader, Andy Stern, endorsed basic income for many of the same reasons as the technology entrepreneurs. The Economic Security Project (backed in part by Chis Hughes) has begun funding basic income projects around the United States. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has a version of Universal Basic Income, rebranded as the \\"Freedom Dividend,\\" as the central plank of his platform.  Basic income pilots and small-scale basic income projects  During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States conducted four Negative Income Tax experiments; they took place in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (1968-1972), rural areas of North Carolina and Iowa (1970‚Äì72), Seattle and Denver (1970‚Äì78), and Gary Indiana (1971-1974). Several Native America nations distribute dividends to their members. For example, members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in North Carolina, receive payments of several thousand dollars twice a year. These payments are dividends from the profits of the Harrah's Cherokee casino, and have been distributed since 1996. A study of the payments' effects on the children of the community found significant declines in poverty, behavioral problems, crime, substance abuse and psychiatric problems, and increases in on-time graduation. The effects were primarily found among those who were youngest when the payments began, and among those who were lifted out of poverty rather than those who were already well-off. As of 2018, the entrepreneurial fund, Y Combinator (run largely by Sam Altman) was planning to run a basic income study in Oakland. In 2019, Stockton, California became the first city in the U.S. to experiment with UBI, giving $500 debit cards every month to 125 residents who earn less than $46,000 annually. Stockton's mayor announced the UBI project would be extended until January 2021. Hawaii In July 2017, Hawaii State Rep. Chris Lee published a bill to investigate basic income for his state.  Permanent fund of Alaska  The Alaska Permanent Fund pays a partial basic income to all its residents since 1982. According to the Basic Income Earth Network, the introduction and development of the only genuine universal basic income system in existence to this day took place just in Alaska in the mid 1970s, just as discussion of basic income was dying down in the rest of the United States. Jay Hammond, the Republican governor was concerned that the huge wealth generated by oil mining in Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, would only benefit the current population of the state. He suggested setting up a fund to ensure that this wealth would be preserved, through investment of part of the revenue from oil. In 1976, the Alaska Permanent Fund was created by an amendment to the State Constitution. After years of political negotiations about what to do with the returns to the fund, Jay Hammond used the power of his office to craft an agreement to create a genuine universal basic income--the Permanent Fund Dividend. Since implementation of the program in 1982, everyone who meets a special residency requirement ‚Äì currently around 650,000 people ‚Äì has received dividend every year. The amount varies each year, but is the same for all residents regardless of age, citizenship, employment status, number of years of residence in the state, and so on. This dividend corresponds to part of the average interest earned, over the previous five years, on the permanent fund set up using the revenue from oil mining. The dividend stood at around $300 per person per annum in the early years but was close to reaching $2000 in 2000, when the stock market plummeted and cut the dividend in half in the course of a few years. In 2008, however, the size of the annual dividends reached a new all-time high with payments of $2069 per person. Oceania =Australia= Basic Income has gained support from Australian academics such as John Tomlinson, John Wiseman, and Allan MacDonald. The Queensland Greens were the first Australian party to adopt a Guaranteed Adequate Income (GAI) policy in 1999. Basic Income Guarantee Australia was accepted into the Basic Income Earth Network in 2006 as an affiliate member. In August 2014, ACOSS made a recommendation to simplify the welfare system via a basic income support payment; however, this differs from a universal guaranteed income in that it would still be means-tested. In 2020, the Greens NSW adopted the Universal Wellbeing Payment as a policy. A basic income implemented through taxation is advocated by the Pirate Party.https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Platform#Merger_of_tax_and_welfare_systems.2C_and_establishment_of_a_basic_income =New Zealand= In March 2016, leader of the New Zealand Labour Party Andrew Little announced a debate at their forthcoming Future of Work conference on the introduction of a universal basic income (UBI), to replace other forms of welfare. He said: > \\"We are keen to have that debate about whether the time has arrived for us > to have a system that is seamless, easy to pass through, [with a] guaranteed > basic income and [where] you can move in and out of work on a regular > basis,\\" or \\"an income support system that means every time you stop work you > have to go through the palaver of stand-down periods, more bureaucracy, more > form filling at the same time as you're trying to get into your next job.\\" South America =Brazil= Basic income has been discussed in modern Brazil at least since the 1980s. In 2001 a law was introduced by Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Brazilian Workers Party which mandated the progressive institution of such a welfare system. By this move Brazil became the first country in the world to pass such a law. Suplicy had previously introduced a bill to create a Negative Income Tax, but that bill failed to pass. The new bill called for a national and universal basic income to be instituted, beginning with those most in need. The bill was approved by the Senate in 2002 and by the Chamber of Deputies in 2003. President Lula da Silva signed it into law in 2004, and according to the bill it is the president¬¥s responsibility to gradually implement the reform. Since then Brazil has started to implement the bill through the Bolsa Fam√≠lia-program, which was a centerpiece of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva's social policy, and is reputed to have played a role in his victory in the 2006 Brazilian presidential election. An independent and privately funded pilot project is currently in place in Brazil in Quatinga Velho The project started 2008 and is organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. It provides R$30 monthly which is 4.4% of the minimum salary in 2013 (as defined by the federal government) and is not enough to meet basic needs. \\"The real value of R$30,00 Basic Income at Quatinga Velho, just is sufficient to help people satisfy the most basic material needs. Children especially enjoy this Quatinga Velho benefit. The project ReCivitas succeeded with the use of extremely limited financial resource, to achieve significant social effects. Should be emphasized the positive impacts to the satisfaction of basic needs and quality of life of the project participants. The results indicate that the BI has contributed to sustainable development in Quatinga Velho. The effects were convincing, particularly in the area of assurance of basic needs, improving the quality of life and social skills.\\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/fee282_4144d9d1ff2c13a43865d1a6c1d5bfcb.pdf \\"(..)This amount of money sounds very small to people from industrialized countries, but it has a large impact in a rural area of Brazil. The coordinators have verified gains in nutrition, clothing, living conditions, health (especially in children), construction of new housing, and improvements to existing ones. In informal interviews, the coordinators have noticed increased self-esteem and social interaction, reduction of social insecurity, and rising expectations of the future, especially regarding children. They noted that they have not observed increased use of alcohol or illicit drugs; significant changes in labor relations, birth, migration or emigration, or generation of political relations and economic dependency.Although the project leaders are examining the effects of the local basic income, the coordinators of the project told USBIG that the point of the project is not to study BIG. They are already convinced that model has been proven effective; they want to put it into practice. The goal is to put the policy in place. If governments are not ready to do it on a national scale with tax funding, Recivitas is attempting to do it on a small scale with private funding.\\"  References  ","title":"Universal basic income around the world"},{"id":"48325768","text":"Blind Spot () is a 2015 Chinese suspense thriller film directed by Danny Pang.

In 1993, he joined the Faculty of Economics at the University of Aix-Marseille II at GREQAM. Philippe Michel first scientific contributions were in the field of mathematics, with a focus on optimal control theory. As the methods developed in this field are important tools used in economics, Philippe Michel progressively entered into this field.

URL : http://economiepublique.revues.org/190 Philippe Michel's contribution to economics is both related to macroeconomics and public economics. His reference framework is the growth model, viewed as a succession of different generations. The numerous contributions can be classified according to three main topics. First, Philippe Michel studies the problem of the choice of a social welfare function that allows defining the social optimum. Second, when the social optimum has been characterized, its decentralization can be achieved in various frameworks where different types of frictions or externalities may come from environment, education, money, etc. Finally, applying an economic policy may imply two problems : the problem of the inconsistency of the optimal policy, and the question of the neutrality of transfers, when agents are altruistic.

Through his publications, he still has an important place in economic research.

He is commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 1 December. Biography Saint Antony was born John Echimos (·º∏œâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ·ºúœáŒπŒºŒøœÇ) at Phossaton near Jerusalem in 785. His parents were Photeinos and Irene, and he had at least a brother named David and a sister named Theodoule. According to his hagiography, as a child he was brought to the hermit John, who foretold his future. When his mother died in , he and his siblings left Palestine for Attaleia. There he entered imperial service, probably in the Byzantine navy. In 821 or 822 he was promoted to ek prosopou (deputy governor) of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme. He held the post until 825, although he may have been promoted to thematic governor (strategos) in the meantime. He participated in the suppression of the rebellion of Thomas the Slav in 822‚Äì823, then spent ten months in Constantinople in 823‚Äì824, before returning to his theme and leading the repulsion of an Arab attack on either Attaleia or Syllaion. In 825, just as he was about to be married, he was secretly tonsured by the stylite monk Eustratios, and adopted the monastic name Antony. Joined by his servant Theodore, he spent some time at Amorion, before moving on to Pylae and Nicaea, and thence to the Agauron or Pandemos Monastery on the Bithynian Olympus. His hagiography claims that during these journeys he was repeatedly rescued from need in miraculous manner. In 829 or 830 he was tried on the orders of Emperor Theophilos by the epi ton deeseon Stephen for his persecution of Thomas the Slav's adherents after the end of his rebellion, and was imprisoned for five months at Constantinople. After being whipped, he was released, and returned to Agauron. Sometime later (Raymond Janin places this between 837 and 843) he went to Briles, where he lived in a chapel dedicated to Saint Panteleimon. He then spent some time in the Monastery of Heraclius at Kios, returned to Agauron until 842, and then went again to the Monastery of Heraclius until 848, when he moved to the metochion of All Saints in Constantinople. Petronas (far left) with the monk who foretold his victory at Lalakaon, here called \\"John of Mount Latros\\". Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes In he cured Petronas, the uncle of Emperor Michael III, who became his disciple. The two had a very close relationship, and Antony is said to have prophesied Petronas' great victory over the Arabs in 863 at the Battle of Lalakaon. In that year, he moved to Ephesus, before returning to Constantinople in 865, spending the final days until his death on 11 November in the Monastery of Leo the Deacon. He is commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 11 November and 1 December. Hagiography His hagiography was a disciple who visited Antony shortly before the latter's death.

Founded in Galveston in 1855, it closed in 1922 when its operator, the Jesuit Order, decided to concentrate their efforts on universities in New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. In 1926 its charter was transferred to St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte, Texas (now in Houston). History St. Mary's University was opened by Jean Marie Odin, Bishop of Galveston, in 1855. The University was founded as a seminary for the training and education of native-born men into the priesthood. However, to help make the seminary self-supporting, and at the same time provide a Catholic education for the youth in the area, Odin decided to include in the project a college for boys. The institution was originally placed under the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Construction of the university began in 1853 and a three-story building was completed in November 1854. The initial enrollment of St. Mary's University was sixty traditional college students and a handful of seminarians. The school formally opened on January 1, 1855 and in 1856 the Texas legislature granted St. Mary's a charter as a university, making it the first state-chartered institution for higher education in Texas. The number of traditional college students continued to grow, but the number of seminary students remained stagnant, so that by 1860 the seminary had ceased to function. By the early part of the 20th century the Jesuits had taken over the operation of the university. However, in 1922, on the order of Father Norbert de Boynes, the university was closed when the Jesuits decided to leave Galveston in order to focus their resources on the two largest universities in the Province of New Orleans.
