She was born in Seattle, Washington and while an English student at the University of Washington she met the American playwright Glenn Hugheswhom she married in 1924 for around 20 years. Hughes wrote comedic one- act plays, mysteries, and non-fiction works. Personal life She was born Helen Babette Plechner in Seattle, Washington on December 28, 1905.Washington Birth Records, 1870-1935 (via Ancestry.com), viewed on May 3, 2018. In 1923, while an English student at the University of Washington she met the American playwright Glenn Hughes, who had joined the university as an assistant professor of drama in 1919.Hughes, Glenn (1894‚Äì1964), Historylink, retrieved May 7, 2017. Secretly married in 1924, they were together for around 20 years. After their divorce in 1944 or 1946, she relocated from Seattle to New York City and married Benn Hall, a public relations executive. Her daughter Mary Anne remained in Seattle, and she returned to Seattle several times to visit. Once Hall died, Hughes took over his public relations firm. Plays Hughes frequently wrote comedic one-act plays, particularly in the subgenre of 10-minute plays. Her writing was reviewed positively, and she was known for her sophisticated characters. As well as writing her own plays, she worked with her husband to translate other monologues and plays from French into English. She wrote more than 20 plays, including: * March Heir (1925)Babette Hughes (1906‚Äì), Dollee: The Playwright's Database, retrieved May 7, 2017. * No More Americans (1925)Adapted into a radio play and presented on-air on KFAC in 1935 by players from Los Angeles City College: see * Three Players, a Fop and a Duchess (1925) * One Egg (1926)Published in 1926 as a part of a collection of twelve plays in The Appleton Book of Short Plays edited by Kenyon Nicholson and published by D.

In 1936, she was published in a collection of One-Act plays in a 2 volume collection, The One Act Theater, along with Ethel van der Veer and her husband, Glen Hughes and published by Samuel French, Inc.. Her 1937 one-act-play If the Shoe Pinches was published in the 1938 anthology The Best One-Act Plays of 1937, which features work by \\"the best-known playwrights\\". If the Shoe Pinches was performed in 1938 with blind actresses performing the six roles. Other works Another of Hughes' earliest works was Christopher Morley, multi ex uno (University of Washington chapbooks, no. 12, 1928), a work based on the life and personality of American poet and novelist Christopher Morley. It was published as part a series of chapbooks developed by her husband at the University of Washington. Hughes presents different aspects of Morley as different characters in the book, which was reviewed positively in the Oakland Tribune in 1928. She wrote two mysteries about a fictional detective from Stanford University, Murder in the Zoo in 1932 and Murder in Church in 1934. In May 1935, she wrote a fictional ending to the actual George Weyerhaeuser kidnapping in a piece for the Seattle Daily Times, in which the poet Egbert Lobe rescues the nine-year-old boy. Hughes' 1946 semi-autobiographical novel Last Night When We Were Young features a character named Julie who experiences similar things to the author. Kenneth Horan, writing for the Chicago Tribune on February 22, 1948, said in a review of the book, \\"There is sufficient talent in Miss Hughes' charming head to write any number of novels. But she seems to be in a hurry. She glosses over incidents with the wide broad sweep of a scythe, and she rushes headlong into the great moments of reconciliation or regret or accomplishment, without waiting to explain. But her writing has a quality of entertainment and for that, all else is forgiven\\". The book was followed the next year by Magic Penny, which was also about a playwright in a relationship with a much younger woman. She also wrote a non-fiction book based on her work in public relations, The right angles; how to do successful publicity (New York: Ives Washburn, 1965).Book News, The Philadelphia Inquirer, June 6, 1965, p. 129.

He was also associated with Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, a multidisciplinary research institute, where he held an honorary professor position and with Tata Institute of Fundamental Research as an adjunct professor since 2008. Kumar lived in R. M. V. Extension in Bengaluru in Karnataka. He died on 28 August 2017. Legacy A high- temperature superconductor levitating above a magnet His doctoral studies at IIT Bombay gave Kumar opportunity to work alongside noted physicists such as Krityunjai Prasad Sinha and Ram Prakash Singh and during his days at the University of British Columbia, he studied condensed matter physics with Maurice Pryce. He carried on his work on superconductivity and disordered systems at Indian Institute of Science and his collaboration with Pedro Pereyra and others yielded the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation, a theory on multi-channel conductivity using the principle of maximum entropy, which has since been subjected to studies by several scientists. Besides his work on diffusion in glasses, he has done extensive studies on random dynamical systems, especially on the nature of electron transport. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 167 of them. He has published four books, Interaction-Magnetically-Ordered-Solids, coauthored with his mentor, Krityunjai Prasad Sinha, Invitation to Contemporary Physics, Deterministic Chaos: Complex Chance out of Simple Necessity and Quantum Transport in Mesoscopic Systems: Complexity and Statistical Fluctuations which is a monograph in the field of mesoscopic physics. He had also guided 12 doctoral students in their doctoral studies. Kumar had been connected with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) since 1970, serving as an associate or senior associate until 1992 and as a staff associate from 1993 to 2010.

It hangs in Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Mar-a-Lago. Background Cowan was not commissioned by Trump to paint the portrait, but after showing Trump a sketch in oils that he had made of him, he gained his approval. Cowan prepared sketches of Trump over several weekends that he was in residence at Mar-a- Lago. The painting was completed shortly after Trump had acquired Mar-a-Lago. Cowan had previously visited the property during its years under the ownership of Marjorie Merriweather Post. Cowan later said of his work that \\"Nobody ever dislikes my portraits ... I know how to make them 'healthy' is the way I put it\\". Description The painting has been described as depicting \\"a young, tanned and handsome Donald Trump dressed in a white tennis sweater\\". Cowan intentionally painted Trump in white clothes to differentiate him from his darker, more formal clothes that he wore in New York City. In a profile of Cowan for Oxford American, Nicole Pasulka wrote that Cowan's subjects are often depicted \\"twenty pounds thinner and twenty years younger, often surrounded by heavenly light, riding exotic animals, or framed by mountain ranges\\", and that Trump's portrait had a \\"standard Cowan sky shot\\". In his 1997 profile of Trump for Playboy, Mark Bowden described Cowan's appeal to Trump as \\"The kind of painter he can appreciate, one who truly sees Trump the way he sees himself in the mirror\\". Bowden likened the portrait to a \\"Sun God\\", feeling that it portrayed a \\"wide-shouldered, thin-hipped Donald, his youthful face eclipsing the sun itself, his skin glowing like the top floors of Trump Tower at sunset, the color of warm bullion.\\" Cowan describes his style as \\"romantic realism\\". =Underpainting of hand= Trump's hand in the portrait was intentionally left unfinished at the time of its completion. It has been described as resting \\"imperially but incompletely on his thigh\\". Cowan later said that \\"I love the sketch portraits, where one hand is finished and the other isn't\\" but that Trump \\"didn't get\\" the underpainting of his hand. Cowan recalled that Trump would ask him \\"'When are you going to finish my painting?' ... I'd say, 'Donald, it is finished'. One day, he said to me, 'How much would you charge to fix the hand?'\\". Cowan eventually agreed to paint the hand for a few thousand dollars, with the agreed price of the portrait ranging from $24,000 to $18,000 according to Cowan. Cowan reduced his regular price for a portrait by 60 per cent for Trump; and was granted regular access to Mar-a-Lago when it became a private members club. Cowan has dismissed claims that he held out for a higher payment by not finishing the hand or that another artist painted the hand. Cowan later said that \\"He always tried to bargain and I don't like that at all\\". The hand was eventually painted in 2002. Cowan has commented on the size of Trump's hands claiming that \\"He doesn't have little hands, like people have said ... They're perfectly proportioned\\". Aftermath Cowan was subsequently commissioned by Trump's second wife, Marla, to paint a portrait of Trump's children. Cowan did not paint Trump's present wife, Melania, as Cowan claims that with the popularity of Trump's television show, The Apprentice, Trump started expecting things without payment. Cowan told Trump, \\"Donald, I don't give away paintings\\".

He was a personal friend of Arthur Conan Doyle, who dedicated to him the short story collection The Captain of the Polestar. Background Born 17 April 1827, he was one of a large family, son of William Drayson who worked at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, and was Clerk of the Works there in 1832, and his wife Ann Marie.Gunpowder & Explosives History Group Newsletter 4, Winter 2002 (PDF) at pp. 13‚Äì4 He was a younger brother of the novelist Caroline Agnes Drayson, and brother-in-law of the novelist John Richardson who married the second daughter Maria Caroline, and was born at Waltham Abbey where the factory was located. Another sister, Louisa, married Samuel Burdon Ellis as his second wife, and was mother of Alfred Burdon Ellis. The fourth surviving daughter, Helen Matilda, married Charles Davies in 1848. Further sisters were Emily (1811‚Äì1894), who married William Woods (died 1856) of Woolwich Dockyard; and Laurette, christened 1819.\\"England, Essex Parish Registers, 1538-1997,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XK8M-358 : 12 December 2014), Laurette Drayson, 11 Jun 1819, Christening; citing Waltham-Abbey, Essex, England, Record Office, Chelmsford; FHL microfilm 1,526,972. The second son of the family was Henry Edwin Drayson, in partnership at Faversham to 1843 with Frederick Drayson, as civil engineers and surveyors. He later visited Lammot du Pont I in the USA. Life and career The family home, which had been at Chatham since 1835 when William Drayson retired, broke up in 1837 when Ann Marie died. Alfred Drayson was educated at Rochester Grammar School from age 11, for two years. He was then withdrawn, after an attack of scarlet fever, spending time as a convalescent with his elder brother, a civil engineer. Drayson graduated in 1846 at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Commissioned, he then served in the Seventh Xhosa War. He rose through the ranks of the Royal Artillery, being promoted captain in 1854, on his return from South Africa; major in 1868; lieutenant-colonel in 1869, and colonel in 1874. He was in India around 1877, and was based at Halifax, Nova Scotia for five years. Group of Woolwich instructors, 1869, with Alfred Wilks Drayson on the extreme right From 1858 to 1873 Drayson was on the Military Topography staff at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, serving as Professor of Surveying and Topographical Drawing. He retired from the army as a major- general in 1883, and became president of the Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society. Drayston died in Portsmouth on 27 September 1901. Interests A member of White's Club, Drayson played billiards and related games including pyramid pool. He was a reputed player of whist, and an author on a well-known book on the subject. =Spiritualism= Drayson attended a s√©ance with the medium Annie Andrews in 1857, and she claimed to put him in touch with his dead brother. It was the start of a long series of such meetings. In 1862 Drayson met Georgina Cowper through Andrews. In 1864 Drayson and Andrews assisted the medium Mrs. Mary Marshall at a s√©ance attended by John Ruskin. It was held at the home of Mrs Makdougal Gregory, widow of William Gregory. More than one s√©ance at this time involved Drayson and Ruskin; at the first, the homeopath John Rutherford Russell was also present. Drayson in May 1864 saw Ruskin and the Cowpers socially. He investigated the supposed haunted Clamps-in-the-Wood, Staffordshire, prompted by a story of a friend, William Howitt. Elisabeth Nichol also sat as a medium for Drayson, in 1867; and he was a member of the Spiritual Athen√¶um of Daniel Dunglas Home, whose s√©ances he had attended, set up in that year. He joined the British National Association of Spiritualists, shortly after its founding in 1873. He showed spirit photographs in 1874 at Broadlands, clashing there with the sceptic John Morley. He was a member of the Society for Psychical Research, and was brought onto the council of the London Spiritualist Alliance by the autocratic Stainton Moses. In 1882 Drayson was living in Southsea, and in subsequent years investigated psychic phenomena there, with Conan Doyle. He also introduced Conan Doyle to theosophy. and to Alfred Percy Sinnett. Conan Doyle later reported, in his History of Spiritualism, the claim that Drayson in the 1880s was receiving a large number of apports through a medium. He retained a sceptical view of this claim, being more convinced by other aspects of Drayson's spiritualism. =Astronomy and Earth science= Drayson published scientific theories, not accepted by later authors. These included discussion of the obliquity of the ecliptic. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1868. While related ideas were put forward by Thomas Belt, the theoretical basis for large tilts in the Earth's axis was undermined by 1880, with work of George Darwin. In 1884, in the weekly Light: A Journal of Psychical, Occult, and Mystical Research, he published a paper The Solution of Scientific Problems by Spirits on the moons of Uranus, relating a conclusion given by a medium in a s√©ance of 1858. It was later contested by Camille Flammarion. After Drayson's death, his views were defended by Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey in Draysonia (1911), and others. Works Illustration by Harrison Weir from Sporting Scenes amongst the Kaffirs of South Africa (1858) Drayson published: *Sporting Scenes amongst the Kaffirs of South Africa (1858) *The Earth We Inhabit: its past, present, and probable future (1859), put forward an expanding Earth theory. Some background is given by Augustus De Morgan in his Budget of Paradoxes, including the prospect of telegraph cables breaking.s:Budget of Paradoxes/L Such breaks were known with Atlantic cables, but are now attributed to underwater mudslides. A contemporary with a related theory was William Lowthian Green. *Great Britain has been and will be again within the Tropics (1859), introduced his \\"second rotation\\" theory. The Eclectic Review called the book \\"pseudo-science\\". *Practical Military Surveying and Sketching (1861) *Tales at the Outspan (1862) *The Common Sights in the Heavens (1862) *The Young Dragoon; or, Every day life of a soldier, by one who has served (1870, anonymous) *On the Cause, Date, and Duration of the Last Glacial Epoch of Geology, and the Probable Antiquity of Man: With an Investigation and Description of a New Movement of the Earth (1873), postulated a 30,000 year cycle with large variation of the Earth's axial tilt. *The Cause of the supposed Proper Motion of the Fixed Stars and an explanation of the Apparent Acceleration of the Moon's Mean Motion (1874) *The Gentleman Cadet: His Career and Adventures at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1875) *Among the Zulus: The Adventures of Hans Sterk, South African Hunter and Pioneer (1879) *Experiences of a Woolwich Professor (1886), includes views on phrenology *The Art of Practical Whist (1886) *\\"The White Chief of the Umzimvubu Caffres\\" from Everyboy's Annual, in book form The White Chief of the Caffres (1887), was paraphrased by Mervyn Peake as part of an early story, published in Peake's Progress (1979). *Thirty Thousand Years of the Earth's Past History Read by Aid of the Discovery of the Second Rotation of the Earth (1888) *From Keeper to Captain: Being the Adventures of G.

Cooper. *The Art of Practical Billiards for Amateurs (1889) *Untrodden Ground in Astronomy and Geology (1890), returned to Drayson's \\"second rotation\\" theory, and influenced A Journey in Other Worlds of 1894. Drayson also contributed to the Boy's Own Paper. Patents Drayson was granted, with Charles Richard Binney, an 1858 patent for improvements to underwater telegraph cables. The invention, the \\"Elongating Tunnel Marine Telegraph\\", was a helical wire in india rubber, to protect against longitudinal strain. In 1868 he was granted one for \\"an improved mode of and apparatus for cooling wort and other liquids\\". He proposed to use carbon disulphide, rather than water, for rapid cooling. In literature Conan Doyle's villain Professor Moriarty has been considered a compound of Drayson, Adam Worth and the forger James Seward. Schaefer, who sees Simon Newcomb as a model for Moriarty, argues that the link from Conan Doyle to Newcomb runs through Drayson and Newcomb's formula on axial tilt, Drayson resenting Newcomb's lack of interest in his own work on the subject; and he regards Drayson as a model for Colonel Moran.Schaefer, B.

They are found in South America, on the Amazonian slopes of the Andes in Ecuador, Peru, and possibly Bolivia, as well as on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Central and the western slopes of the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia. Etymology The generic name Rulyrana honors and who have \\"contributed enormously to the understanding of centrolenid diversity, biology, and evolution\\". The name is made up from the two first letters of their surnames in combination with rana for frog. In addition, \\"Ruly\\" is the nickname of Mart√≠n Bustamante, who has also contributed to amphibian conservation. Description Rulyrana have moderate to extensive webbing between the third and fourth fingers. The dorsum is lavender in preserved individuals and may have spots. Internal features include green bones (in live specimens), lobed liver that is covered by a transparent hepatic peritoneum, whereas the ventral parietal peritoneum is white in its anterior part and transparent in its poster part. The digestive tract is translucent. In terms of osteology, Rulyrana have dentigerous process in the vomer and‚Äîusually‚Äîvomerine teeth. The humeral spines are not present. While distinct from most other glass frogs, there are no characters that could unambiguously place a species in Rulyrana or in the genus Sachatamia; genetic data are needed for an unambiguous allocation. The two genera, however, have largely disjunct distribution areas (Rulyrana are found in the Amazon Basin and the Colombian Cordillera Central while Sachatamia are not found further east than the Colombian Cordillera Central). Reproduction The males call while sitting on upper sides of leaves or rocks. The eggs are deposited on leaves or rocks. Species There are six species: * Rulyrana adiazeta (Ruiz- Carranza and Lynch, 1991) * Rulyrana flavopunctata (Lynch and Duellman, 1973) * Rulyrana mcdiarmidi (Cisneros-Heredia, Venegas, Rada, and Schulte, 2008) * Rulyrana saxiscandens (Duellman and Schulte, 1993) * Rulyrana spiculata (Duellman, 1976) * Rulyrana susatamai (Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1995) The AmphibiaWeb includes also Sachatamia orejuela in this genus.

History Metal theft in the UK is largely the responsibility of the British Transport Police (BTP). Metal recycling traders can be traced by Trading Standards, regulated by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Most metal theft in the UK is classed as non-domestic burglary. In the year to March 2016, according to the ONS, there were 16,155 metal theft offences across the UK's 42 police forces, a significant decrease of 38% over the previous year.ONS Property Crime 2015/16 In England and Wales there were 3 metal theft offences per 10,000 population. North East England has the highest rate of metal theft - 7 per 10,000 population. Information on metal theft is available at the Home Office Data Hub, run on CKAN (created by the Open Knowledge International at the University of Cambridge). =Price of copper= In 2006, the price of copper significantly increased by three times, and the spates of copper theft from railway signaling increased significantly. Operation Tremor was implemented by the BTP and Network Rail to counteract the spates of theft. Sources of metal =Electricity substations= Copper conductor has been taken from electricity substations. Lead church roof at Feniscowles in Lancashire, in February 2009 after two spates of lead theft from the roof =Church roofs= Church roofs have been stripped of the lead roof, forcing some into near bankruptcy. Replacing church roofs is prohibitively expensive. =Railway signalling cables= Copper cable for signalling alongside railway lines has been removed, known as cable theft. =Telephone cables= Telephone communication cables are made of copper, and some villages have been completely disconnected from the BT telephone network by thieves. =Automotive Catalytic Converters= Catalytic converters contain valuable metals (platinum and rhodium) and can be stolen easily from some makes of automobiles when parked. Vehicles can be targeted for theft based on amount of valuable metal and ease of removal of converter. Prevention Metal recycling in the UK is largely regulated by the British Metals Recycling Association trade association.

After showing little ability as a juvenile she emerged as a leading performer over middle distances in 1983. She won six of her first seven races including the Lingfield Oaks Trial, Musidora Stakes, Lancashire Oaks and Irish Oaks. She was also placed in the Yorkshire Oaks, Park Hill Stakes and Gallinule Stakes and ended the year rated the best filly of her generation in Ireland. After her retirement from racing she had some success as a broodmare, being the dam of the Falmouth Stakes winner Alshakr, and the grand-dam of Harayir. Background Give Thanks was a \\"workmanlike\\" bay mare with a small white star bred in England by Mrs M. P. Pitt. As a yearling in December she was put up for auction and was sold for 33,000 guineas. She entered the ownership of Mrs Ogden White and was sent to Ireland where she was trained by Jim Bolger. She was ridden in most of her races by the Irish jockey Declan Gillespie. She was sired by Relko, the French-trained winner of the 1963 Epsom Derby. Relko was not a conspicuous success as a breeding stallion, although he did sire Relkino, Olwyn, Lanfranco. Her dam Parthica showed some ability as a racehorse and was a daughter of the influential broodmare Violetta, whose other descendants have included Sir Percy, Teenoso, Harayir, Rule of Law and Olympic Glory. Racing career =1982: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1982 Give Thanks failed to win in three races. She finished unplaced in her first two races over seven furlongs and then finished third over one mile on her final appearance of the season. =1983: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Give Thanks recorded her first success as she won a maiden race over ten furlongs on heavy ground at Navan Racecourse. She followed up by winning a race over nine furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse by three lengths. Although she had never been entered for The Oaks, the filly was then sent to England to contest two of the major trials for the race. In the Lingfield Oaks Trial over one and a half miles on 6 May she won by five lengths from the highly regarded British filly Cormorant Wood. Five days later she was dropped back in distance and started the 13/8 favourite for the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. She produced an even better performance as she won by eight lengths from So True and New Coins, with the other three runners (including the Fillies' Mile winner Acclimatise) reportedly \\"strung out like washing\\". Later that month she was matched against male opposition in the Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh and finished second to the colt Carlingford Castle. Although there was some disappointment at the result (she had started 5/6 favourite), the form of the race looked much better after Carlingford Castle finished second to Teenoso in the 1983 Epsom Derby on 1 June. Give Thanks was back in England in July for the Lancashire Oaks on good ground at Haydock Park an starte at 4/1 with the best of her twelve opponents looking to be Acclimatise, who had finished second to Sun Princess in the Epsom Oaks and Ski Sailing who had beaten Sun Princess at Newbury earlier in the season. In a slowly-run race. the Irish filly looked to be struggling when the pace quickened in the straight but got to the front a furlong out and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Ski Sailing. On 21 July, on her seventh run of the campaign, Give Thanks was moved up to Group 1 class for the first time to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles on firm ground at the Curragh, and started the 7/4 favourite ahead of the British-trained challengers High Hawk (winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot) and Shore Line (fourth in the Epsom Oaks). The best-fancied of the other nine runners were Safe Process, Bay Empress (third in the Pretty Polly Stakes) and Green Lucia. After tracking the pacemaker Hocus Pocus, Give Thanks took the lead entering the straight, accelerated clear of her rivals and stayed on to win by two and a half lengths from High Hawk with Green Lucia in third place. The much-anticipated meeting between Give Thanks and the English champion Sun Princess took place in the Yorkshire Oaks on 16 August and the fillies started at 7/4 and 6/5 respectively in a six-runner field. In the event Give Thanks failed to show her best form and was beaten seven lengths into third place by Sun Princess and Green Lucia. She was then moved up in distance and started favourite for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 7 September but was beaten three-uarters of a length by the improving High Hawk. The filly ended her season with a trip to the United States for the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park on 12 November. She finished fifth of the eight runners behind All Along, losing third place in a multiple photo-finish. =1984: four-year-old season= At the end of the 1983 season Give Thanks was retired from racing and was covered by the stallion Kings Lake in early 1984. She failed to conceive and was sent back into training later that year. On her return to the track in September at the Curragh she ran promisingly when taking third place behind Opale an Marble Run in the Meld Stakes. Later that month, on her only subsequent start she finished fifth behind the gelding Bedtime in the September Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse. Assessment and honours The level of Give Thanks' performances in 1982 were insufficient to earn her a place in the Irish Free Handicap. In the official International Classification for 1983 she was rated on 82, nine pounds behind the top-rated three-year-old filly Habibti. She was the top-rated Irish three- year-old filly, alongside Flame of Tara. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 123, 13 pounds behind Habibti who was their Horse of the Year. She was rated 106 by Timeform in 1984. Give Thanks is honoured in the name of the Give Thanks Stakes, established in 2003 at Cork Racecourse. Breeding record After the end of her racing career, Give Thanks became a broodmare for Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. She produced eight foals and three winners between 1986 and 1995: *Saffaanh, a bay filly, foaled in 1986, sired by Shareef Dancer. Failed to win in five races. Dam of Harayir. *Ghzaalh, chestnut filly, 1987, by Northern Dancer. Failed to win in two races. *Makin, bay colt, 1990, by Danzig.

Location The Paradajz is located across the easternmost tip of Ada Huja and right in front of the banks of the neighborhood of Vi≈°njica, approximately at the Danube's . Geography The island began to form around 1986, due to the alluvial silt brought by the Danube. Until 2011 it grew to an area of . As the island expanded, it formed a canal in front of Vi≈°njica. Canal is named \\"Karlica\\" and is today considered the better access path to Ada Huja's bay of Rukavac where the Vi≈°njica Marina is located. The island was originally round but by 2017 it got elongated and grew into the almost perfectly symmetrical eye shape. Name of the island, Paradajz, means tomato in Serbian language. One theory is that it got the name thanks to its original round shape. Another one claims that the name originates from the tomatoes which began to grow wild on the island. Wildlife Paradajz is heavily forested. In 2012, planting of the common osier began on the island in order to clean and filter the waters on the shore. Human interaction Belgraders began to visit the island from 2006. First major work on Paradajz was done in 2011, when in the period of six months the island was cleaned from the waste brought constantly to the shores by the Danube. The overgrowth was partially cleared and small green zones are created. Using only wooden material from the island, wooden amphitheater and a futsal court were built. Dry and cleared wood was ground into the sawdust which was used for the creation of a long trim trail which circles around the island.

He was best known for documenting Eucharistic miracles around the world and cataloguing them all onto a website that he created in the months before his death from leukemia. He was noted for his cheerfulness and his computer skills as well as for his deep devotion to the Eucharist, which becomes a core theme of his life. He was beatified on 10 October 2020. Life Carlo Acutis was born in London on 3 May 1991 to a wealthy Italian family with Irish and Polish roots. Acutis family background and leading role in Italy's business community. His baptism took place on 18 May 1991 in the church of Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea. His parents, Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano, who were not especially religious, had worked in London and Germany, but finally settled in Milan in September 1991, not long after their first son's birth. Carlo evinced a precocious interest in religious practice and requested to receive his First Communion at the unusually early age of seven. He achieved his aim at the convent of St. Ambrogio ad Nemus) and made the effort either before or after Mass to reflect before the tabernacle. Acutis became a frequent communicant and would make a weekly confession. He is said to have had several models as guides for his life: especially Saint Francis of Assisi, and including Saints Francisco and Jacinta Marto, Dominic Savio, Tarcisius, and Saint Bernadette. He was educated in Milan at the Jesuit Instituto Leone XIII high school. On the social side, Acutis would worry about friends of his whose parents were divorcing and would invite them to his home to support them. He defended disabled peers at school when bullies mocked them. Outside school, he did voluntary work with the homeless and destitute. Although he greatly enjoyed travel, the town of Assisi remained a particular favourite. Those around him considered him a \\"computer geek\\" on account of his passion and skill with computers and the internet. Acutis applied himself to creating a website dedicated to cataloguing each reported Eucharistic miracle in the world. He completed this in 2005 (he had started the catalogue at the age of eleven). He admired Blessed Giacomo Alberione's initiatives to use the media to evangelize and proclaim the Gospel and aimed to do likewise with the website he had created. He also liked films and comic editing and used a playstation. It was on the website that he said: \\"the more Eucharist we receive, the more we will become like Jesus, so that on this earth we will have a foretaste of heaven\\". When he contracted leukemia he offered his suffering both for Pope Benedict XVI and for the Universal Church. He said, \\"I offer all the suffering I will have to undergo for the Lord, for the Pope, and the Church\\". He had asked his parents to take him on pilgrimages to the sites of all the known Eucharistic miracles in the world, but his declining health prevented this from happening. The doctors treating his final illness had asked him if he was in great pain to which he responded that \\"there are people who suffer much more than me\\". He died on 12 October 2006 at 6:45 AM from M3 fulminant leukemia. He was buried in Assisi in accordance with his wishes.  Legacy  Carlo's mother, Antonia, is said to attribute to his intercession the fact that, at the age of 44, she gave birth to twins, born exactly four years to the day after his death. Following the Church's recognition of a miracle in 2020, attributed to Carlo, Antonia told the press that her son had appeared to her in dreams saying that he will not only be beatified but also canonised a saint in the future. In memory of Carlo, bishops Raffaello Martinelli and Angelo Comastri have helped to organize a travelling photo exhibition of all the Eucharistic miracle sites. It has since travelled to dozens of different countries across five continents. Beatification The call for him to be beatified began not long after Acutis' death. The campaign gained momentum in 2013 after he was named a Servant of God, the first stage on the path towards sainthood. The Lombardy Episcopal Conference approved the petition for the official canonization cause to proceed at a meeting in 2013. The opening of the diocesan investigation was held on 15 February 2013, with Cardinal Angelo Scola inaugurating the process, and concluding it on 24 November 2016. The formal introduction to the cause took place on 13 May 2013, and Acutis became titled a \\"Servant of God\\". Pope Francis next confirmed his life as one of heroic virtue on 5 July 2018, and declared him Venerable. On 14 November 2019, the Vatican's Medical Council of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints expressed a positive opinion about a miracle in Brazil attributed to Acutis' intercession. Luchiana Vianna had taken her son, Mattheus, who was born with a pancreatic defect which made eating difficult, to a prayer service. Beforehand, Vianna had already prayed a novena asking for the teenager Acutis' intercession. During the service her son had simply asked that he should not \\"throw up as much\\". Immediately following the service, Mattheus told his mother he felt healed and asked for solid food when he came home. Until then he had been on an all-liquid diet. After a detailed investigation, Pope Francis confirmed the miracle's authenticity in a decree on 21 February 2020, leading to Acutis' beatification. Within a month of the decree, Italy experienced its first wave of COVID-19 cases, which caused the beatification ceremony to be postponed while the country was on lockdown. It was rescheduled for 10 October 2020 and was held at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi in Assisi, Italy, with Cardinal Agostino Vallini presiding on the pope's behalf. , the postulator for Acutis' cause is Nicola Gori.

The monastery is documented from the early 14th century. The extant church, a domed cross-in-square design, dates to 1759. It was a familial abbey of the Kvenipneveli dynasty, Dukes of Ksani and one of the leading noble families of the Kingdom of Kartli.  History  The 15th-century Georgian chronicle of the dukes of Ksani ascribes the foundation of the monastery to the family's legendary 6th-century ancestor Rostom, allegedly a contemporary of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. The monastery is historically better documented from the early 14th century, when generations of the dukes of Ksani made donations to it. The monastery was destroyed during Timur's invasions of Georgia in 1400 and rebuilt and frescoed by Grigol Bandaisdze. In 1470, the monastery was further renovated by the duke Shalva, who also built a defensive wall with a bell-tower on it. Shanshe, Duke of Ksani, added further fortifications, turning it into his castle. In 1759, the church was built de novo as the Monastery of St. Theodore Tyron by the duke David and his mother Ketevan. The event is commemorated in a Georgian asomtavruli inscription of the icon of the Theotokos from Largvisi. This still-extant edifice, which replaced the older domeless one, had a completely new layout.  Architecture  The Largvisi Monastery sits on a slope of a hill on the confluence of the Ksani and Churta rivers. It is a domed cross-in-square church, with the dimensions of approximately 20 x 12 m. The overall plan is elongated on an east-west axis. The church is built of brick and covered with blocks of hewn stone, with four stone pillars in the nave. The dome rests upon high aisles joining in a cross shape. The church has two, western and southern entrances. Above the western window is a sculpture carved in stone‚Äîa human right hand and tools of masonry. The defensive structures adjoining the monastery are parts of a citadel with ruined walls and towers higher on the hill.

In 1905, he obtained a BA from the College of Wooster. In 1910, he received an MA in History from Columbia University. Career =Journalism= In 1910, Blankenhorn joined the staff of the New York Evening Sun. By 1914, he had become assistant city editor. He followed labor issues, unions, and strikes. He served as a propaganda expert in France during World War I. =Labor activist= In 1919, he became co-director of the Bureau of Industrial Research. He worked directly with the InterChurch World Movement and, through it, the Steel Strike of 1919. In 1921, he also served as acting publicity director for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers' Union, where he helped establish the New York Leader. By the early 1920s the Socialist Party was in severe membership decline and funding of the New York Call became correspondingly tenuous. In a last-ditch effort to save the paper, it was reorganized in the fall of 1923 to include non-Socialists in its management. On October 1, 1923 the name of the paper was formally changed to the New York Leader as a reflection of this new orientation. Pacifist minister Norman Thomas, formerly of The World Tomorrow, was named as editor of the publication. Heber Blankenhorn became managing editor, Evans Clark business manager, and Ed Sullivan sportswriter. This effort to stabilize the daily newspaper's funding was unsuccessful, however, and the New York Leader was terminated just six weeks later. From 1921 to 1924, he wrote two books on steel unions and contributed to labor journals. In 1924, he joined the staff of Labor magazine. =Federal service= In 1935, he accepted a position on the public relations staff for the National Recovery Act. He became an assistant to Senator Robert F. Wagner and helped pass the National Labor Relations Act. He went on to serve as industrial economist to chairmen of the National Labor Relations Board and the La Follette Committee for its hearings on the Ford Motor Company. He returned to service for the U.S. Army during World World II (1942‚Äì1946) on a psychological warfare team and reached the rank of colonel. In 1946, he returned to service on the National Labor Relations Board and resigned in 1947. =Return to federal service= In 1949, he directed a UAW investigation into attempted assassinations of Victor and Walter Reuther. =Return to journalism= In the 1950s, he returned to journalism, based in Europe on staff to Labor magazine, then retired to Alexandria, Virginia, to write his memoirs.

He began his career in 1937 making scientific advances in uranium enrichment (isotope separation) as research assistant to Harold Urey, who discovered deuterium‚Äìthe heavy isotope of hydrogen. Cohen worked within the Columbia group of physicists that included Harold Urey, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Isidor Isaac Rabi, John R. Dunning, Eugene T. Booth, A. Von Gross and others)‚Äìall pioneers of nuclear energy. In 1942, the Manhattan Engineer District Project was established at Columbia University, and research began on various approaches for separating out the fissionable uranium isotope, U-235. Cohen developed the theory for the now-universal method of centrifugal isotope separation for enriching uranium, but was deeply involved also with the theory of gaseous diffusion, and literally wrote the book about both methods. Cohen and Urey were convinced that the Uranium Committee had made the wrong choice in 1942 by picking gaseous diffusion instead of centrifuges to produce U-235 for the atom bomb, and thus extended the war by a year. In 1944, Cohen left Columbia and went to work for Standard Oil Development Company to advise on nuclear energy. Edward Teller‚Äôs autobiography Memoirs reflects positively on Cohen and Urey's centrifuge method for producing U-235 when he writes:Edward Teller: Memoirs ‚ÄúWhat if we had the atomic bomb a year earlier? The easiest and least expensive method of separating isotopes, a method used throughout the world today, is based on a centrifuge procedure that Harold Urey proposed in 1940. General Groves chose the diffusion method instead. Karl Cohen, Urey‚Äôs able assistant during that period, believes that Groves‚Äô decision delayed the atomic bomb by a year. ‚ÄúIf Dr. Cohen is right, atomic bombs of the simple gun design might have become available in the summer of 1944 and, in that case, would surely have been used against the Nazis. Atomic bombs in 1944 might have meant that millions of Jews would not have died, and that Eastern Europe would have been spared more than four decades of Soviet domination.‚Äù In 1948, Cohen became technical director for H.K. Ferguson's Atomic Energy Division, which was building the Brookhaven, Long Island, nuclear reactor. By 1952, Cohen was a founder, vice president and operating manager of Walter Kidde Nuclear Laboratories (WKNL), a privately funded research facility formed to commercially develop nuclear power. The lab's principal contract was with the Atomic Energy Commission for R&D; on reactors, and it established many industry standards, especially regarding slightly enriched uranium and water moderated reactor concepts. Cohen's long association with General Electric began in 1955, at first as a consultant, then as a manager involved with advanced engineering, advanced products, breeder reactor development, and operational planning. In 1973 Cohen was appointed Chief Scientist of G.E.'s commercial nuclear department. After his retirement in 1978, Cohen consulted for companies such as G.E., Boeing, and Exxon, and organizations such as the Institute for Energy Research, Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute. Cohen also continued to be active on committees, at conferences, and in more informal peer review of technology and policy papers. He also taught intermittently at Stanford during this time, and donated his papers to the Stanford Library (M1798, Karl Cohen Papers). Karl Cohen died of natural causes in 2012. His last published paper was in Science in 2002, but due to his vast knowledge of the field, he continued to be a source of information on nuclear energy and nuclear policy for several years after the paper. Cohen had a dream of bringing safe, abundant and affordable energy to the world. His paper published in 1992 in the International Journal of the Unity of the Sciences, Volume 5, Number 3 entitled \\"A Promise Unfulfilled\\" argues that before the potential of nuclear fission as a limitless source of energy for earth's societies can be reached, there must first be disarmament and nuclear weapons must be destroyed. Biography Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York to Jewish parents Joseph Cohen and Ray (Rachel) Paley Cohen. He had one older sibling, sister Matila Cohen (Simon), 10/11/1908 ‚Äì 9/22/1997. At age five, Cohen survived the Spanish Flu but in retrospect felt that it permanently changed his overall health. At age 17 [1930] his father Joseph, who had wanted him to study medicine, died of Crohn's Disease; this discouraged Cohen from medical study. Instead he pursued chemistry which had been a great interest of his in high school (Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn‚Äô. He then declined a full scholarship at Cornell University and instead attended Columbia University in order to stay with his recently widowed mother. Cohen continued at Columbia, earning a Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year and completing his bachelor's degree in Chemistry with Honors in 1933, Master's in 1934, and PhD in 1936, both also in Chemistry (thesis advisor: Charles Beckman]. His greatest academic interests had evolved toward physics and mathematics, but finances prohibited changing his major. He often mentioned that as a college student he never attended lectures, but preferred studying on his own and then passed exams ‚Äì being largely self-taught. When he completed his doctorate at age 23 his sister encouraged him to travel. He went to France in 1936 and enrolled at the Sorbonne (University of Paris) where he met his future wife, Marthe-Hermance Malartre, a journalism student who was running a hiking club. He traveled widely in 1937, going as far as Russia, but returned to New York in the Fall of 1937 to job hunt so he could marry. He couldn't work as a chemist in industry, where Jewish surnames were generally unwelcome. Ultimately, Columbia professor and Nobel laureate Harold Urey hired him as research assistant, beginning years of successful collaboration and personal friendship. Cohen returned to France in the summer of 1938. With the Third Reich threatening to start a general war in Europe, he and Marthe decided to marry quickly, and on September 21 caught a ship (the Normandie) from Le Havre to New York. The crossing was fraught with drama: as the tail end of the 1938 hurricane battered the ship, rumors circulated aboard that a German U-boat was trailing them. They settled into an apartment in New York on Amsterdam Ave., very close to Columbia and the Pupin building where he was based from 1940-44. This and other labs were consolidated and renamed the Special Alloyed or Substitute Alloy Materials Labs (SAM Labs), the precursors to the Manhattan Project. Karl and Marthe had three children: Martine, born 10/14/1939; Elisabeth, born 4/6/1943, and Beatrix, born 10/11/1948. In 1943 they bought nine acres of forested land on Long Island, near Smithtown. The land cost $550, which they paid in 10 installments. The name of the buyer was Marthe Malartre, to avoid pervasive anti-semitic problems. They installed a log cabin and dug a well with a hand pump. All lighting was from kerosene lamps, and big blocks of ice for the ice box were delivered periodically. They bought a used black Plymouth and hoarded their gasoline rations for weekends in the woods. Karl developed an interest in mushroom hunting and gardening. After their second child was born, Karl and Marthe thought of moving out of the city. He left the Project in 1944 for a job with Standard Oil Development Company in Bayway, New Jersey. Urey and Fermi had homes in New Jersey, and Karl tried to buy a house in the town of Elizabeth. Unfortunately, they were not able to find a neighborhood that accepted Jews. In 1946 the family traveled to Oak Ridge, Tennessee for three months, as Karl sought to immerse himself more in reactor technology. Karl and Marthe bought a 1949 two-toned brown Hudson, shocking the owners of all the other cars in the parking lot at H.K. Ferguson, which were standard black. In 1950, The family moved to a house and garden in Bayside, a small suburban town on Long Island. There was a full basement, with room for cold-war food storage, and a darkroom where Karl developed his black and white photographs. Other hobbies included wine-making, gardening, and playing the piano. By 1952, Karl was working in Garden City, Long Island, at the Walter Kidde Nuclear Laboratory along with W.I Thompson, a close friend since the Standard Oil days. In 1956, the family moved to Palo Alto, California, where Cohen was Manager of General Electric's new Advanced Engineering facility in Sunnyvale. He became a devoted cactus collector, filling his garden with a variety of specimens, meticulously tending to them. Post retirement, Cohen consulted for the next 12 years and was involved in reactor development in France, Germany, and Japan and the USA. He drove German cars due to promises made when GE coordinated with the German nuclear program (his BMW license plate read PU-239). Karl and Marthe traveled extensively throughout the West, combining cactus with photography, until Marthe became incapacitated in 1988. Karl retired from his consulting, and took over running the household. Marthe died in March 2010 after a long illness, ending their 71-year marriage. Two years later Karl died in Palo Alto of natural causes at age 99. Hobbies/other interests: Karl Cohen was a classical pianist and mastered works by Mozart, Chopin, Schubert and others. His favorite composer was Bach, and he spent many hours perfecting the Art of the Fugue. Early in his life he had debated becoming a professional concert pianist. He surprised his family by acquiring an organ during retirement in order to do justice to many of Bach's works.Information in this article (not otherwise noted) was obtained from two of Cohen's three daughters, Elisabeth and Beatrix, from personal discussions with their father, as well as the May 28, 1988 two hour video interview with Cohen by Clarence Larson for his Pioneers in Science Series.

The German forces of the III Panzer Corps and the 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich of the II SS Panzer Corps attempted to envelop and destroy Soviet forces of the Voronezh Front. This operation was necessitated by the failure of the German II SS Panzer Corps to break through Soviet forces during the Battle of Prokhorovka on 12 July. Therefore, German commanders decided to first link up the III Panzer Corps, which had been lagging behind due to heavy Soviet resistance, with the II SS Panzer Corps, in order to consolidate the German positions into a continuous frontline without inward bulges and enable the two panzer corps to overrun Soviet forces defending Prokhorovka together. The linking up of the two German pincers was planned to effectuate the envelopment of the Soviet 69th Army and other supporting units. The operation commenced on the morning of 14 July, and by the end of 15 July the two German pincers had linked up, but they failed to trap the majority of the Soviet forces, which by then had already fought their way out of the trap. Prelude On the morning of 5 July 1943, the Wehrmacht launched its offensive, Operation Citadel, against the Soviet forces defending the Kursk salient. They made slow but steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines. After a week of fighting, the Soviets launched a major counterattack, which resulted in one of the largest clashes of armoured forces, the Battle of Prokhorovka. The attacking Soviet forces were decimated in the battle, but they succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt ‚Äì the last heavily fortified one. On 13 July Hitler summoned Field Marshall Erich von Manstein to his headquarters, the Wolfsschanze in East Prussia. The Allied invasion of Sicily on the night of 9‚Äì10 July, combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General Walter Model's 9th Army on the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July, and the attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and begin redeploying forces to the Mediterranean theatre. He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel. Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough in the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the rest of the summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved. After the meeting with Hitler on 13 July, Manstein hastily put together the plans for Operation Roland, realizing that he only had a few days to conduct the operation before he lost the II SS-Panzer Corps due to redeployment. The plan called for Das Reich to attack east and south and link up with III Panzer Corps, which would attack to the northwest. Totenkopf and Leibstandarte were to anchor the western and northern flanks of Das Reich, respectively. Once the link was achieved and the Soviet forces encircled, Prokhorovka would then be attacked shortly thereafter by the combined forces of the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps. The goal of the operation was to destroy the Soviet armoured reserves massed in the southern sector of the Kursk salient, and thereby check Soviet offensive capacity for the rest of the summer.  Operation  The orders for Operation Roland were issued in the closing hours of 13 July 1943. However, after Hitler's meeting with Manstein, Hitler countermanded the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS- Panzergrenadier Regiment Der F√ºhrer of Das Reich struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting the remnants of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following violent house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting. Das Reichs 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with Das Reich, but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces in the gap, was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The link-up failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and Totenkopf began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front. On 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts launched a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the 6th Army and 1st Panzer Army. In the early afternoon of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it as early as the evening of 16 July. Leibstandartes tanks were distributed between Das Reich and Totenkopf, and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while Das Reich and Totenkopf were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives.

The topic of orangutan speciation was poorly understood until the 1980s, when genetics revealed that orangutans actually comprise these two genetically distinct species. Before this was known, orangutans from differing subspecies were paired in captivity, and in some cases produced hybrid offspring. Subsequently, the government of Indonesia and the organization that oversees zoo programs in the United States suggested to stop interbreeding of Sumatran and Bornean orangutans and called for disallowing hybrids to reproduce. From 1971 to 1985, 90 orphaned or displaced orangutans rescued from illegal animal trade were released into Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan. A subsequent genetic survey determined that at least two orangutans, captured in a different region and therefore not native to the park, had prolifically interbred with the local native apes, and produced at least 22 hybridized descendants. Their offspring contributes to fears that interbreeding of subspecies leads to \\"hybrid vigor\\", in which \\"offspring reap the benefits of their parents' individual qualities\\", but \\"offspring born to parents from two genetically distinct populations, which have not been in genetic contact for significant periods of time, have also been shown to suffer poor health and reproductive success in a range of different species.\\" This is thought to lead to \\"outbreeding depression\\", where hybrid individuals die earlier than non-hybrids, thereby contributing to a diminishing orangutan population.

It is found in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth of one to two metres. Description Life cycle of Acetabularia acetabulum This alga adheres to the substrate with rhizoids (root-like processes), and these are the only part of the alga present in the winter. The thallus consists of a single cell, and in the spring a slender stem develops from the holdfast, growing vertically to a length of about . Growth is interrupted at intervals while a whorl of hairs develop which encircle the stem, branching dichotomously. As the stem lengthens and more whorls grow, the lower hairs drop off leaving behind a circular scar. When the stem is fully developed, a disc-shaped cap up to wide grows at the tip, the whole frond resembling a pale green parasol; further whorls of hairs grow from the upper surface of the cap. Biology Before cap expansion, the organism consists of a single cell with a single nucleus, located at the base of the stem. As the cap expands, the nucleus divides once by meiosis after which it divides multiple times by mitosis, producing thousands of haploid \\"secondary\\" nuclei. These migrate up the stem into the cap, each becoming enclosed in a gametangium containing the nucleus and a small amount of cytoplasm. Inside the gametangium, the nucleus undergoes further repeated mitotic division, so that by the end of summer, when the cap disintegrates, thousands of \\"tertiary\\" nuclei are released into the sea as gametes from each gametangial ray. Fertilisation occurs in the open water, and the zygotes settle on the seabed. This alga is unicellular, each frond being formed from a single large cell containing several million chloroplasts. These are in constant motion: in the daytime, they move to expose to themselves to the maximum degree possible to the light and the stems appear uniformly dark green, while at night they aggregate into clusters and the stem becomes pale green. This effect can be demonstrated by shining a ray of blue light on a stem in the dark and extinguishing it some time later, forming a transient green band. This alga has been used as a model organism in developmental biology, being useful for this purpose because of the enormous size of its single cell with its single nucleus, and its complex cytoarchitecture and development.

It consists of the remnants of a farm outbuilding that was occupied in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by farm laborers, providing a rare window into the material culture associated with that population. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description The Clark Farm Tenant House is located near one of the town's major roads, on land that once belonged to the Clark family, who were major landowners in the area in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its only surface features are the protruding remains of a fieldstone foundation, measuring about . Based on aerial photographs of the area taken in the 1930s, augmented by interviews with longtime local residents, the structure that stood on the foundation was a roughly framed gable-roofed house. Other features of the site, not visible from the surface, include a shallow dug well and a privy. The house is believed to have been occupied by tenant farmers of the surrounding farmland, from about 1860 to about 1940; the house burned down in the 1940s. The land was owned by Charles P. Clark, who owned hundreds of acres of land in the town, and was one of its major tobacco growers. Tax records show that Clark owned four houses in the town, presumably living in one and renting the others to tenant farmers. The site was identified during a state highway works project in 1996, and underwent an intensive excavation in 1998. That work identified the extent of the site, and recovered more than 3,000 artifacts, including many domestic items such as pottery sherds, glass, buttons, nails, trolley tokens, and a pocket watch.

Built in 1927, it is a distinctive example of Romanesque Revival architecture with Gothic features. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, and is a contributing property to the Downtown New Britain historic district. Description and history The Commercial Trust Company Building is prominently located in the center of New Britain, just west of the City Hall complex on the north side of West Main Street. It is a seven-story masonry structure, with an exterior finished in limestone on the lower levels, and brick on the upper ones. The lower three levels form a monumental facade, with three tall rounded-arch openings mostly filled with glass, and a side . The center one has a bronze doorway providing access to what was historically the bank lobby, which has tall ceilings, marble floors, and a surviving teller's counter. The upper four floors of the building, now converted to apartments, are faced in brick, with the top-floor windows in Gothic-arched openings. The building is crowned by a corbelled brick cornice. The decorative elements of the facade include repeated occurrences of blacksmith's anvils, which were one of the symbols of the Commercial Trust Company. The building was erected in 1927 for the Commercial Trust Company, which was organized in 1915 as an alternative to the New Britain National Bank. The building is a statement of the organization's (and the city's) prosperity in the 1920s. By 1929, with the advent of the Great Depression, the company fell on hard times and closed its doors in December 1930. The building was eventually purchased by the New Britain National Bank.

It traces back in continuous lineage to Girgis al-Dahdah, the son-in-law of Ghazal al-Qaysi, Muqaddam of Aqoura, who died in 1375 without male issue. Beginning in 1703, the family received agricultural estates in the Futuh tax- farming district of Mount Lebanon, and in 1705 it settled in the nearby village of Aramoun in the Keserwan District. Its members have collectively held the iqta', or tax-farming concession, for the Futuh district of Mount Lebanon from Ottoman authorities from 1771 until the Ottoman Tanzimat ended the iqta' system in Mount Lebanon in 1859. One branch of the family, that of Mansur al-Dahdah also held the iqta' for the Byblos District for about the same period of time. In the writings of 19th century chroniclers of Mount Lebanon, such as those of Antuniyus Abu Khattar al-'Aynturini (d. 1821), Tannus al-Shidyaq (d. 1859), and Mansur al-Hattuni (d. ca. 1880), the House of al-Dahdah [Aal al-Dahdah in Arabic] is alternatively referred to as the mashayikh (lords) and the muqata'jiyah (iqta' holders or tax farmers) of the Futuh district of Mount Lebanon. Among its members were several officials at the court of the Mount Lebanon Emirate, Ottoman consuls in trading cities around the Mediterranean, Papal Counts, and notable Lebanese statesmen, literary men, clergy members, military officers, and senior civil servants. It has consisted of five branches since the early 18th century, of which one is now extinct.  Origins  The family claims descent from an eponymous ancestor, Thabit ibn al-Dahdah, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad and a member of the Sahabah, also known as Abu al-Dahdah, whose descendants are believed to have migrated to Damascus in the wake of Arab conquests, then settled in Aqoura, then an administrative dependency of Damascus, before converting to Christianity. These claims were first made in the early decades of the 20th century, during a time of pan-Arab and pan-Syrian ideological effervescence. The XVIIth and XVIIIth century chronicles of Mount Lebanon do not refer to such an ascendance. Rather, early Islamic jurisprudence dictionaries appear to indicate that the Sahabi Thabit ibn al-Dahdah died without male or female issue, prompting an exceptional ruling from the Prophet Muhammad to allocate his properties to the son of Thabit's sister.  Aqoura period: from 1375 to 1703  The first proven ancestor of the al-Dahdah family is Girgis al-Dahdah, who was the deacon (in Arabic, shidyaq) of the Maronite community of Aqoura in Mount Lebanon in the second half of the 14th century. This Girgis was the son-in-law of the Muqaddam Ghazal of Aqoura, the community's secular leader, who had died in 1375. They both belonged to the Qaysi party. Aqoura, in the hinterland of Byblos, appears to have been a focal point of the Qays-Yaman rivalry that was engulfing Mount Lebanon and other rural parts of Bilad al-Sham in the late Mamluk and early Ottoman times, perhaps due to the concentration of clans of Arab tribal origins in the town, and its location as the terminus of an ancient Arab nomadic migration route that has remained in use until recent years (by the Arabs of al-Luhayb and Laqlouq among others). The tombstone of the priest Yusuf al-Dahdah in Saint Georges church in Aqoura (d. 1677) Following Girgis al-Dahdah, the family's line of descent features at least six successive priests, beginning with his son who became a monk under the name of Mikhail. One of these priests refers to himself as \\"the priest Hanna son of the priest Ibrahim al-Dahdah\\" on the margins of a liturgy book dated on from 1572 on the sacrament of marriage for the parish church of Saint Georges of Aqoura, and appears to have copied a similar book in 1560. A paternal cousin of this priest Hanna, Sulayman al- Dahdah is recorded by Patriarch Istifan al-Duwayhi as having copied a liturgy book in Aqoura as early as 1552. Another later al-Dahdah cleric, Ighnatius, is recorded as having overseen the rebuilding of 'Aqura's parish church, named after Saint George in 1730, according to an inscription in the Arabic vernacular language and Garshuni script now located to the left of the western entrance of the 20th century church. This succession of single children over seven generations has raised many questions about the possible existence of lateral branches of the family which either died out or survived without retaining the al-Dahdah name. Indeed, another one of these priests, Yusuf (1602-1677) mentions the existence of several of his own children (\\"awladi\\") among other family members, in a blessing he wrote in 1649 on the margins of a prayer book from a church in Aqoura, where he identified himself as \\"a priest under the name of Yusuf, servitor of Aqoura, ordained by the [...] Patriarch Yuhanna Makhluf [...], son of the late Mikhail son of the late priest Hanna son of the late priest Ibrahim referred to as ibn al-Dahdah from Aqoura the protected under the care of God in Mount Lebanon the blessed, in the dependency of the country of Baalbeck\\". The series of al-Dahdah priests comes to an end with the Shaykh Yusuf al-Dahdah (1675-1762), the grandson of the aforementioned priest Yusuf. Shaykh Yusuf's momentous career is described in detail in Tannus al-Shidyaq's chronicle of the histories of notable families from Mount Lebanon. His existence is otherwise independently confirmed by a colophon he wrote as a youth in Syriac Garshuni script in 1692 on the margins of a liturgy manuscript, now at the French National Library. Yusuf identifies himself in the colophon as the deacon \\"Yawsep bar Dahdah(o) of the blessed village of 'Aynquro\\", the Syriac name of Aqoura. Incidentally, the second colophon in the prayer book was written by a \\"'Imad son of Shi'mun of Aynquro\\" at the same time. This 'Imad was perhaps 'Imad al-Hashim, a local strongman who drove his rival Shaykh Yusuf al-Dahdah and his family out of Aqoura in 1702. Father Luwis al-Hachim, in his local history of al-'Aqura (1930), lists numerous properties in Aqoura and its vicinity that still bore the al-Dahdah name long after they had been sold. Among these was the \\"land of al-Dahdah\\" in the area of al-'Aqabah, and the \\"orchard of al-Dahdah\\" in the locality of 'Ayn al-Lahta, and weekly water usage rights known as \\"the Mondays of al-Dahdah\\". Aqoura, the original abode of the Al-Dahdah Shaykhs in Mount Lebanon  Futuh period: from 1704 to 1856  Shaykh Yusuf al-Dahdah's exile from Aqoura in 1704 marks the irruption of the family on Mount Lebanon's political scene and the rise of its fortunes first as tax administrators for the Hamadah overlords of Northern Mount Lebanon after 1705, and later as associates of the Shihab emirs of the Mount Lebanon Emirate after 1763, and iqta' holders of the Futuh district after 1771. Ottoman archives in Istanbul show that the Shiite Hamadah Shaykhs played a much larger role in the history of Mount Lebanon in the 17th century than Lebanese chroniclers have recognized. Their semi-autonomous emirate reached the height of its power in the late seventeenth century, when much of North Mount Lebanon, including the seat of the Maronite patriarchate in the Qadisha Valley, was under their effective control. They had collected taxes and policed the largely Maronite tax farm districts of Byblos, the Futuh, Batroun, Jibbat al-Munaytrah and Jibbat Bsharri of Mount Lebanon on behalf of the Ottoman provincial authorities of the Tripoli Eyalet since the 1630s. As Ottoman iqta' holders (tax-farmers) with an interest in maximizing tax revenues and hence agricultural output from the districts they had received a fiscal concession for, the Hamada Shaykhs appear to have relied on Shaykh Yusuf al-Dahdah and his sons Mansur and Sulayman after him to administer and develop one of their less populated districts, the Futuh. In 1703, he was granted the agricultural estates of 'Ayn Jwayya, 'Ayn al-Dilbah, 'Ayn Sjaa', 'Ayn al-Gharah and 'Ayn al-Husari in the Futuh district as his private property; in 1704, his servants, properties and cattle and those of his associates were exempted from taxation, and he himself was put in charge of the tax collection and administration of the Futuh district. Indeed, a contemporary reference to him under \\"Shaykh Yusuf al-Aquri al-Maruni\\" as collecting Ottoman taxes for areas of the Futuh District on behalf of Shaykh Ismail Hamadah occurs in a biography of Maronite Patriarch and historian Estephan El DouaihyPatriarch Estephan Douaihy on Ehden Family Tree website (1630-1704) written by Douhaihy's successor Patriarch Jacob Awad (d. 1733). Annual Iltizam conventions between the Ottoman authorities and the Hamadah Shaykhs in the archives of the Ottoman Sharia Court in the provincial capital of Tripoli show a systematic inclusion of a financial guarantee (kafala) clause after 1740, perhaps as a result of Hamadah Shaykhs repeatedly defaulting on their tax collection obligations. In almost all cases, the financial guarantors (kafil) were Maronite shaykhs from areas under Hamadah tutelage. In 1762, Mansur al-Dahdah and his brother Sulayman acted as guarantors (kafil) on the iltizam contract of the sons of Ismail Hamadah for the Byblos district, and had to sell their personal properties to pay the Ottoman authorities of Tripoli for the sum of 25,000 Ottoman piasters of tax monies owed by the Hamadah Shaykhs when these defaulted on their payments. Local chronicles report the sale by Mansur al-Dahdah and his brothers of the villages of Fatqa and al-Kfur as well as half of Jabal Moussa in payment for the sums owed as guarantee for the Hamadah iltizam. In 1761 and 1763 respectively, Mussa al-Dahdah and his brother Mansur entered the service of the Shihab emirs of the Shouf in southern Mount Lebanon, as the power of the Hamadah Shaykhs declined following their bankruptcy and multiple Ottoman military campaigns against them, and all their iltizam concessions in Northern Mount Lebanon were transferred to the Shihab emirs in 1763. The year 1763 and the following years marked the beginning of a long period of association of the al-Dahdah family with the Shihab emirs of Mount of Lebanon. Through the good offices of Mansur al-Dahdah, Emir Yusuf Shihab had received the annual iltizam of the Northern Mount Lebanon districts, which the Ottoman Pashas of Tripoli had previously awarded to different members of the Hamadah clan, and he put members of the al-Dahdah family in charge of administering and collecting imperial taxes from these districts. In 1763, Shaykh Mansur al- Dahdah was put in charge of administering the people and revenues of the Byblos District, a position which was later passed on to his son Hanna and his grandsons Lwis and Jahjah after that; his brother Shaykh Wuhbah al-Dahdah was put in charge of Jubbat al-Munaytra, the former stronghold of the Hamadah Shaykhs. Shaykh Mansur al-Dahdah also received large estates in the Byblos and the Futuh districts, as compensation for the sale of his properties to guarantee the Hamadah obligations under their iltizam. Palace of Shaykh Sallum al-Dahdah in Aramoun, Lebanon When in 1771 Emir Yusuf Shihab also took over the iltizam for the districts of Southern Mount Lebanon from his uncle emir Mansur Shihab, he appointed several members of the al-Dahdah family to positions of power and influence. Most significantly, the House of al-Dahdah collectively received the hereditary iqta' (tax-farm concession) for the Futuh muqata'ah (tax-farm district). After that date, the family's history becomes intimately intertwined with that of the Shihab emirate of Mount Lebanon under Yusuf Shihab then Bashir Shihab II, with its upheavals and bright spots. Indeed, Emir Bashir Shihab II mainly recruited his advisers among members of the al-Dahdah family. Most prominent among these were Shaykh Sallum al-Dahdah son of Mussa, and Shaykh Mansur al-Dahdah son of Sallum.  Arms  In Lebanon: A cross surrounded by two olive branches, according to family tradition. In France, where the branch of Count Rochaid Dahdah was admitted into French nobility: \\"d'or, au c√®dre arrach√© de sinople, au chef du meme\\"  Branches  The five branches of the al-Dahdah evolved from the five sons of Shaykh Yusuf al-Dahdah: Abu Yunis Ibrahim, extinct in 1883; Abu Dhahir Sulayman; Abu Nassif Mussa, Abu Hanna Mansur; and Abu Sarkis Wahbah.  Place names  Several neighborhoods, streets and public buildings in Middle Eastern and French cities were named after members of the family at various points in history. 1) In Beirut, Lebanon, a neighborhood was known as Hayy al-Dahdah or Mahallat al-Dahdah near the old Damascus road just outside the city's old downtown, and appears in maps as late as 1911. The name of the neighborhood is no longer in use, but a street in the same area carries the name of Rochaid El-Dahdah. Another street in the Achrafieh neighborhood of Beirut carries the name of Mansur al-Dahdah. A map of Beirut from 1911 by Wagner and Debes, Leipzig, shows the neighborhood known as Al-Dahdah by the old Damascus Road. 2) In Damascus, Syria a neighborhood just north of the old city is still known as Hayy al-Dahdah (the quarter of al-Dahdah), and was known as Marj al-Dahdah (the field of al-Dahdah) into the early Middle Ages. Marj al-Dahdah is now the site of al-Dahdah cemetery, one of the cities oldest and largest. Both the field and the cemetery are named after the 10th century CE Hadith scholar Abu al-Dahdah Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Tamimi, who lived and is buried there. Popular lore wrongly attributed the naming of the cemetery to the Sahabi Thabit ibn al-Dahdah, who appears to have died in Medina without issue, and not in Damascus. 3) In Tunis, Tunisia, a public park in the Berges du Lac neighborhood, is named after Count Rochaid al-Dahdah, who was the adviser and personal secretary of the bey of Tunis between 1863 and 1869. 4) In Marseille, France, where Merii Al-Dahdah and Rochaid Al-Dahdah had their commercial headquarters, there remains a Boulevard Dahdah, in the 4th Arrondissement of Marseille and an Ecole Primaire Dahdah, 15 Boulevard Dahdah, Marseille, 13004 both named after Merii. 5) In Dinard, France, the Rochaid square was named after Count Rochaid Al-Dahdah, the town's principal developer in the 19th century.  Prominent members  Shaykh Merii Al-Dahdah Abbas Al-Dahdah (d. 1890), who became Maronite archbishop of Damascus under the name Nomatalla Count Rochaid Al-Dahdah in front of his villa Les Deux-Rives in Dinard, France * Hanna al-Dahdah (ca. 1560), a priest and copyist from 'Aqura, son of the priest Ibrahim, son of the monk Mikhail, son of Girgis al-Dahdah. Patriarch Istifan al-Duwayhi list him in his history book Tarikh al-Azminah as one of the two copyists of Maronite liturgy books hailing from Aqura in 1552 and 1560. The other priest Duwayhi mentioned was the priest Sulayman al-Dahdah, the son of priest Hanna's paternal uncle. One of the liturgy books the priest Hanna al-Dahdah finished copying in April 1572 was a prayer book intended for the church of Saint Georges of Aqura. That prayer book was still in existence in 1930. He also copied a similar prayer book which he offered to the monastery of Sayyidat al-Habs (Our Lady of the Hermitage) in Aqura in the year 1560. * Yusuf al-Dahdah (1602-1677), a priest in 'Aqura, son of Mikhail, son of the priest Hanna, and one of the first Maronite historians of Mount Lebanon. His numerous historical annotations on the margins of Maronite liturgy books are only known from excerpts in Father Luwis al-Hashim's book Tarikh al-'Aqura. His chronicles shed light on many otherwise little known events of the history of the Maronite community in Mount Lebanon. * Yusuf al- Dahdah (1675-1762 d. 1733 in other sources), son of the priest Girgis, son of the priest Yusuf, tax-farmer for the Futuh District for Shaykh Ismail Hamadah, and secretary of Amir Husayn al-Harfush of Baalback.

He left a detailed eye-witness record of the trip of Bashir Shihab II to Egypt to meet Mohammed Ali, which was published in 1920. From the contemporary account of Mikhail Mishaqah about Shaykh Salloum: \\"Let us return to Emir Bashir. He ruled the land, and his intendent for the affairs of his subjects and for issuing orders within the land was Shaykh Abu Khattar Sallum al-Dahdah, the grandfather of the metropolitan Nimat Allah al-Dahdah who presently occupies the archepiscopal throne in Damascus. He was the first Shaykh of the Dahdah family to be addressed by the emir as \\"my dear brother\\". * Mansur al-Dahdah (1779-1861), son of Sallum, took over the mudabbir (or kakhia, chief administrator) function for Bashir Shihab II in 1817 when his father retired; he accompanied Emir Bashir Shihab to his second trip to Egypt in 1822, and remained in the function of mudabbir until 1828, when Bashir Shihab gave this responsibility to his son emir Amin; he retired in his palace in Aramun; in 1841, at the bequest of Bashir Shihab III, he led his troops in battle against detachments of the Egyptian army; a contemporary newspaper account of this event, written from Smyrna, and which appeared in Italian on November 19, 1841 in the Gazetta di Firenze mentions Mansur al-Dahdah at the head of 5,000 Christian men at the Dog River (Nahr El Kalb, north of Beirut).

He developed the beach resort of Dinard, in France, and was a close friend and business associate of Charles Auguste, Duke of Morny, who was French Minister of Interior (1851-1852), Speaker of Parliament (1854-1865) and otherwise half brother of French Emperor Napoleon III. As adviser and creditor of the bey of Tunis, he played a role in the fall of the Regency of Tunis to the French, and was elevated to the hereditary dignity of Count Palatine by Pope Pius IX in 1863, and by the French government in 1867. * 'Abbas Ghalib al-Dahdah (1818-1890), ordained in Rome under the name Nomatalla in 1845, following studies at the College of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith iN Rome, then Maronite archbishop of Damascus from 1872 till his death in 1890. * Mer'i Nader al-Dahdah (1782-1868), entrepreneur, and owner of a trading office in Marseille, and adviser of King of France Louis Philippe I on Oriental affairs.

The reported decision is extremely short, and the judgment itself is only two pages. The word \\"floating charge\\" does not appear in it. Decision The case related to an appeal by a debenture holder against an order of Malins VC. The appeal came before Sir G.M. Giffard LJ. The issue centred upon the company's ability to assign all of its \\"undertaking\\" to a mortgagee, and whether undertaking included the proceeds of sale of vessels belonging to the company. The appellants relied upon the decision of the House of Lords in Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLC 191 that a mortgage requires that mortgagee must have the power to prevent the mortgagee from removing the property. Here not only could the ships be sailed out of the jurisdiction, the company could also \\"deal with them as they pleased\\", including ultimately selling them. Giffard LJ held: The court was clearly at pains to limit its ruling to the individual case. In addition to stressing \\"in this particular case, and having regard to the state of this particular company\\", his Lordship went on to say \\"I do not refer to such things as sale or mortgages of property\\". However, that notwithstanding, the case continued to be applied and the role of floating charges, having been implicitly recognised expressly enforced, continued to develop and to grow.

The teeth of Palaeoxondon have an elongate lower molar talonid, with hypoconid placed buccal to the midline of the crown, well-developed upper molar metacone and wing-like parastylar region. Taxonomy Palaeoxondon belongs in the order Amphitheriida, closely related to Dryolestida. They are among the earliest Cladotherian mammals, which have their origins in the Middle Jurassic, and include the last relative of Amphitheriida, Dryolestida, Peramurida and Zatheria (which includes modern Therian mammals). Recent phylogenetic studies indicate that it was a sister taxon to Amphitherium itself.Panciroli E; Roger B.J. Benson; Richard J.

She is also the founder of Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center.  Biography  Barbara Lewis King was born in Houston, Texas, to parents Mildred Jackson Shackelford and Lec Andrew Lewis. She was raised by paternal grandmother, Ida Bates Lewis. At 13, she felt a calling to ministry when she volunteered as a Sunday school teacher. At 15, she became a Woman's Day speaker in history at Houston's Antioch Baptist Church. She was married, with one son, Michael, whom she had despite doctors' prognosis that she could not have children because of a disease that she had had. She also mothered a young woman from Ghana, and was the grandmother of five and great-grandmother of three. King earned a BA in sociology from Texas Southern University and a Masters in social work at Atlanta University‚Äôs School of Social Work. She also obtained a Doctor of Ministry from the Ecumenical Theological Seminary of Detroit, Michigan in 2012.  Career  After obtaining her Masters, King moved to Chicago and worked as a social work administrator, leading the city‚Äôs public housing outreach program. There, she met Rev. Johnnie Colemon, the first female African American minister she had met thus far, and was inspired to redirect her path to ministry. King then worked as the director of administration of Christ Universal Temple, Rev. Colemon‚Äôs church, and was mentored by her throughout her ministerial training in New Thought and Traditional Thought at Missouri‚Äôs Unity Institute of Continuing Education and the Baptist Training School in Chicago. Following her training, she was ordained twice, by Rev. Roy Blake and then by Rev. Colemon. She then became a professor of social work at Clark Atlanta University, and then the dean of students at Spelman College. She started a Bible study group with 12 members, which grew to become Hillside Chapel and Truth Center. In 1971 she founded the Hillside Chapel and Truth Center. The Hillside Chapel is non-denominational and serves around 5,000 people. In 2001, King was named the Development Chief of the Assin Nsuta village in Ghana, West Africa, an area with historic routes in the Slave Route Site. She was the first woman to be ordained as a chief in the region. Her stool name is Nana Yaa Twunmwaa I. King was the first Bishop in the International New Thought Christian Movement. She was committed to ‚Äú[transforming] lives by practicing and demonstrating the teachings of Jesus The Christ‚Äù. She taught and ministered in Finland, Russia, England, Canada, Israel, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, the Caribbean, Brazil, British Guiana (Guyana), and Australia. She led the formation of Hillside Fountain, a South African sister church to her Atlanta church. She ordained the first New Thought minister in South Africa and joined the Sisters of the Boa Morte in Brazil, African origin nuns who were prohibited from serving the traditional church. In 2010, she became the first bishop of the New Thought Christian Movement of Churches. She was a guest lecturer at Harvard Divinity School Summer Institute for Ministers, and was also involved with Association of Global New Thought, Concerned Black Clergy of Metropolitan Atlanta, Regional Council of Churches, the American Jewish Committee, Life Members of the NAACP, Academy of Certified Social Workers, National Association of Social Workers, Life Member of the National Council of Negro Women, the National Women's Law Center, Chaplain of the City of Atlanta Police Department, and the Mayoral Appointee to the Ethics Board of Metro Atlanta.

Such a niche provides favorable conditions for growth, and eventually metastasis, in an otherwise foreign and hostile environment for the primary tumor cells. The discovery of the pre-metastatic niche has fostered new research regarding the potential treatment of metastases, including attempts to stop the flow of vesicles from primary tumors to pre-metastatic niches in secondary organs and different combinations of previously-employed therapies.  Pre-Metastatic Niche Formation  Tumors metastasize to particular organs due to the migration of hematopoietic bone marrow cells expressing VEGFR1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1) and stromal cells to these particular sites prior to the arrival of primary tumor cells. These cells form pre-metastatic niches in order to prepare the secondary organ for the arrival of the primary tumor cells and allow these cells to gather and more easily colonize the organ. Pre-metastatic niche formation is influenced by many different bodily processes, including the suppression of the immune system and an increase in the presence of cytokines and other growth factors. Hypoxia in the primary tumor and the movement of exosomes from the primary tumor to the secondary organ are additional phenomena that are partially responsible for the formation of pre-metastatic niches.  Role in Metastasis  In order to metastasize, tumor cells should arrive at an organ with an environment conducive to their growth, such as a pre-metastatic niche. The creation of this environment is accomplished by factors from the primary tumor that alter the structure of the secondary organ in order to allow cells from the primary tumor to more easily colonize the secondary organ. Tumor cells release factors that cause bone cells to resorb and therefore increase the rate of metastasis. Bone is conducive to the metastatic process given its composition of many different kinds of cells and its ability to grow skeletal structures. Without the process of pre-metastatic niche formation, metastases are less likely to occur. There are often tumor cell deposits found in organs without a metastasis, indicating that metastases do not always colonize the tissues that they enter after leaving the circulatory system.  Role of the Immune System  Pre-metastatic niche formation is possible due in large part to the presence of a suppressed immune system. Primary tumors recruit myeloid cells, which are the precursors to immune cells, in order to allow the tumor cells to avoid detection by the immune system as they metastasize, and thus allows the metastasis to flourish. Once the primary tumors have entered the bloodstream, myeloid cells that have been recruited by the tumor protect the cancer cells from detection by the immune system, which would otherwise be more likely to be effective in halting metastasis. Myeloid progenitor cells, recruited at various different stages in their cell cycle, are believed to constitute much of the pre-metastatic niche, as they can protect the tumor cells from the standard immune response as the cancer cells attempt to colonize the pre-metastatic niche. Given their important role not only in protecting the growing metastasis from immune system attacks, but also in enabling extravasation, myeloid cells are a key factor in the development of the pre-metastatic niche, and thus eventually in promoting metastases. Chemokines, a class of signaling molecules, also play a significant role in the creation of pre-metastatic niches and metastases. The primary tumor, in an attempt to evade detection by the immune system, uses chemokines in order to increase recruitment of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells to secondary organs. In addition, cancer cells from the primary tumor can be used to induce inflammation in the future site of the pre-metastatic niche in the secondary organ, which is similar to the immune response created by an infection. Thus, the large presence of immune cells allows the pre- metastatic niche to ward off attacks by the immune system and therefore allow the tumor to metastasize without inhibition. Immune suppression, combined with hypoxia and ECM, among other processes, are essential steps in allowing a primary tumor to metastasize, as they allow tumor cells to grow in a foreign and hostile environment without being destroyed by the typical response of the immune system. Specifically, necessary amino acids are depleted and lymphocyte movement is decreased while regulatory T cells, which suppress the immune system, and oxidative stress are increased.  Discovery of the Pre-Metastatic Niche  Metastasis has typically been condensed into a few simple steps, namely that the tumor cells leave the primary tumor and travel to secondary organs via the circulatory system in an attempt to invade the foreign environment of the pre-metastatic organ. Since tumor growth is often difficult in a new and relatively hostile environment, metastasis had been considered by many to be an inefficient process, despite its high mortality rate. Although Stephen Paget's previously established ‚Äòseed and soil‚Äô hypothesis correlates with the newer idea of primary tumor cells migrating to pre-metastatic niches, the focuses of many researchers are shifting from the primary tumor, given the assumed inevitability of metastasis in the presence of a tumor, to the secondary organs where metastases occur. The role of exosomes in priming organs for metastasis has only recently become a significant topic of conversation among researchers, due in large part to the discovery of tumor cells deposits in organs without metastases. The concept of the pre-metastatic niche was defined by Dr. David Lyden's lab in 2005.  Implications for Cancer Treatment  The recognition of the concept of the pre-metastatic niche allows researchers to consider several new possibilities for treating cancer. One such possibility is employing methods that attempt to limit the expression of VEGFR1 in cells, thereby combating metastasis by delaying the creation of or eradicating the pre-metastatic niche altogether. Targeting hypoxia in the primary tumor and the suppression of the immune system could also stop the creation of pre-metastatic niches. Factors from the primary tumor that structurally alter the secondary organ in order to facilitate its colonization by tumor cells could also potentially be targeted in an attempt to stop metastasis. Tumor cells grown in different microenvironments yield different types of protein, indicating that varying types of oncological treatments are needed for tumors in distinct locales. It is easier to target later stages of metastasis because cancer is often not found until the earlier stages of metastasis have been completed. Thus, a combination of primary therapies and drugs that combat metastasis could be used to arrest the colonization of a secondary organ by tumor cells, as this would stop both the cells flowing from the tumor and the formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Alternatively, using drugs to stop tumor cells from migrating to pre-metastatic niches could be an effective method of halting metastases.

Launched in 2016 by Alan Foster & LaVar Ball, it has most notably produced signature shoes for the Ball brothers: Lonzo Ball of the New Orleans Pelicans, LaMelo Ball of the Illawarra Hawks, and LiAngelo Ball of the Los Angeles Ballers. Big Baller Brand has additionally been involved in the creation of the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), which it fully funded, and both the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games and Big Baller Brand International Tournament, which were a series of Lithuanian exhibition games hosted by BC Vytautas (featuring LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball).  Origins and history  On April 14, 2016, Big Baller Brand announced that it would soft launch by June 2016. Founded by personal trainer and former football player LaVar Ball, the company was built on \\"core family values,\\" according to its website. Ball later said that he created Big Baller Brand, which was based in Chino Hills, California, for his three sons: Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo Ball, who all played basketball at Chino Hills High School when it was established. He also stated that each of the three Bs on the company's logo stands for one of his sons. Upon its launch in June, Big Baller Brand initially sold T-shirts, shorts, and sweatshirts through its online store. It partnered with a local design, printing, and shipping company, Garment Decor. In 2017, it also began working with sneaker company Brandblack for assistance in its shoe design. To maintain independence from Big Baller Brand, however, Brandblack created an offshoot creative agency Santa Ana Design for the partnership. Alan Foster, a family friend of LaVar Ball, has additionally become a manager and business associate of Big Baller Brand, helping design its signature shoes. On March 7, 2017, Big Baller Brand was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and its official slogan \\"Built for this\\" was trademarked on February 7, 2018 after being filed for in May 2017. In March 2019, it was reported that Lonzo Ball severed ties with co-founder of Big Baller Brand, Alan Foster, after concerns of his criminal past and alleged misuse of $1.5 million of Ball's personal and business accounts. In April 2019, the Big Baller Brand website was shutdown. When accessing the website only a notice that says ‚ÄúThank you for visiting Big Baller Brand. Our website is under construction we will be back soon. Thank you.‚Äù is shown. As of November 2019, the site's splash page directs visitors to click the BBB logo to go to a shopping page. Instead, guests who click are redirected to the official home page of Alan Foster. Big Baller Brand, promises a separate web site in the near future. On February 19, 2020 Products =Sportswear= In May 2017, Big Baller Brand announced a November 2017 release of its first signature shoe, the ZO2 for Lonzo Ball. The base price of $495 garnered significant media attention. LaVar Ball responded on Twitter to critiques of the shoes' price: \\"If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER,\\" for which he received further media criticism. In an interview with Colin Cowherd in May 2017, Ball said that if the big shoe companies like Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour want to make a deal with his Big Baller Brand, the asking price is $3 billion. He also said that Baller has sold between 400 and 520 ZO2 shoes. In another interview, Ball described the shoes as \\"stitching and glue,\\" stating that they were \\"not that big of a deal.\\" On August 31, 2017, it announced the release of a signature shoe for LaMelo Ball, called the Melo Ball 1 (MB1), which was scheduled to be available in late 2017. According to Big Baller Brand, the shoe will be exceptionally light upon a request by Ball himself. The MB1 is currently priced at $395. On December 4, 2017, Big Baller Brand revealed plans to create a signature shoe, known as the Gelo 3, for LiAngelo Ball after he left UCLA, following a shoplifting incident in China. Similar to the MB1, the Gelo 3 is also set at around $395. However, his shoes would later be renamed to the G3 Lux during his playing time in Lithuania. The company's founder, LaVar Ball, also announced he would have signature shoes of not just his own, but a brand for his wife as well. LaVar's shoes are considered to be named \\"LaVariccis,\\" while Tina Ball's signature shoes would be named \\"The Comeback,\\" which was inspired by her recovery from a stroke she had in 2017. On October 17, 2018, Big Baller Brand released a cheaper version of Lonzo's shoe, the ZO2.19, priced at $200. = Other products = Big Baller Brand Water After LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball signed their first professional contracts with Vytautas Prienai‚ÄìBir≈°tonas of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL), Big Baller Brand saw an increased presence in Lithuania in 2018. On February 9, 2018, Big Baller Brand announced its partnership with the Lithuanian bottled water company Bir≈°tonas Mineral Water, a sponsor of Vytautas. LaVar Ball stated that Big Baller Brand would import water from Lithuania to the United States with a price similar to Perrier and S.Pellegrino products. Sponsorships On December 20, 2017, LaVar Ball announced the creation of the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), a professional league completely funded by Big Baller Brand that is designed as an alternative to college basketball for high school graduates. The league, which launched in the summer of 2018, was expected to pay players $3,000 to $10,000 per month and include teams from several major American cities. According to Ball, players will be required to exclusively wear Big Baller Brand products, with uniforms, shoes, and other apparel provided by the company. On May 4, 2018, LaVar's youngest son, LaMelo Ball, was confirmed to be one of the players entering the upstart league, while also being touted as the face of the league by his father. On January 5, 2018, Vytautas, the first professional team of LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball, announced that it would withdraw from the Baltic Basketball League (BBL) and in its place host five exhibition games to showcase the Ball brothers, called the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games. The games, which took place from January 9 to January 29 and were live streamed through Facebook, featured widespread advertisement of Big Baller Brand, with Business Insider commenting that the company was \\"the real star of the show.\\" Shortly after the Ball brothers began playing professionally, LaVar Ball heavily invested in Vytautas, helping it pay off its debts and allowing Big Baller Brand to become the team's main sponsor as a result. The team was also involved with the Big Baller Brand International Tournament and a few other exhibition games involving the Chinese Basketball Association's Guangdong Southern Tigers and the British Basketball League's London Lions during the 2017‚Äì18 season, with the Big Baller Brand's founder coaching the team during those events. On February 15, 2018, Lonzo Ball released his debut rap album, Born 2 Ball, under the Big Baller Music Group. The label was a subsidiary of the Big Baller Brand and would be run by a close friend of LaVar's. In April 2018, after previously wearing the ZO2 shoes during a game, Jordan Crawford was the first professional basketball player not related to the Ball family to look into having a partnership with the company. Crawford also gave the company words of approval for what they are doing. A month later, rapper Quavo of Migos fame was seen promoting Lonzo Ball's Big Baller Brand merchandise on Instagram, with later reports suggesting that Quavo would be an ambassador of the Big Baller Brand. Customer service In January 2018, Big Baller Brand was given an F grade by the Better Business Bureau, which said that Big Baller Brand \\"has a pattern of complaints\\", specifically that many customers have had to wait \\"weeks or even months to receive their order\\". Some customers alleged that they have received the wrong merchandise or even nothing at all, and that it had been difficult to contact the company. In May 2018, All-Star baseball player Adam Jones complained on social media that he just received his ZO2 Prime Remix shoes after ordering them a year earlier. A year later, Blair Looney of the Better Business Bureau stated that the Big Baller Brand still had an F grade and that \\"we are continuing to work with them on straightening things out.\\" References External links *Official website Category:2016 establishments in the United States Category:Sportswear brands Category:American companies established in 2016 ","title":"Big Baller Brand"},{"id":"53975739","text":"The next-in-line effect is the phenomena of people being unable to recall information concerning events immediately preceding their turn to perform. The effect was first studied experimentally by Malcolm Brenner in 1973. In his experiment the participants were each in turn reading a word aloud from an index card, and after 25 words were asked to recall as many of all the read words as possible. The results of the experiment showed that words read aloud within approximately nine seconds before the subject's own turn were recalled worse than other words. The reason for the next-in-line effect appears to be a deficit in encoding the perceived information preceding a performance. That is, the information is never stored to long-term memory and thus cannot be retrieved later after the performance. One finding supporting this theory is that asking the subjects beforehand to pay more attention to events preceding their turn to perform can prevent the memory deficit and even result in overcompensation, making people remember the events before their turn better than others. In addition, the appearance of the next-in-line effect does not seem to be connected to the level of fear of negative evaluation.

By May 1970, the New York section of the Young Lords followed its then Central Committee (which included Oliver-Velez, Officer of the Day) and decided to break away from the national Young Lords' office in Chicago, renaming their new group the Young Lords Party. The separation was never a hostile one and had more to do with the rapid development of the group‚Äîor \\"growing pains\\"‚Äîa natural friendly competition between cities, and primarily by infiltration and repression by government groups that were trying to create conflict between the chapters to divide and ultimately destroy the newly formed movement.Churchill, Ward, & Jim V.

However, in 1970 Oliver-Velez was appointed as Minister of Economic Development and became the highest ranking woman in the party. One of the major contributions women made to the success of the Young Lords Party included publishing its Position Paper on Women, which was later included in The Young Lords: A Reader (2010), edited by Darrel Enck- Wanzer (see external links below for the full text of that book). Oliver-Velez helped construct the paper and theorized the intersection of race and class in the lives of women of color for it. She and another former Young Lords member, Iris Morales, wrote a foreword for The Young Lords: A Reader (2010). In addition to her activism with the Young Lords, Oliver-Velez was also an AIDS movement activist and a member of the Black Panther Party.

It is distinct from bacteria that may cause infection in the glands. It differs from the oral microbiome which is located in the oral cavity. Oral microorganisms tend to adhere to teeth. The oral microbiome possesses its own characteristic microorganisms found there. Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums. \\"[T]here may be important interactions between the saliva microbiome and other microbiomes in the human body, in particular, that of the intestinal tract.\\"Microorganisms reside in saliva  Characteristics  Unlike the uterine, placental and vaginal microbiomes, the types of organisms in the salivary microbiota remain relatively constant. There is no difference between populations of microbes of based upon gender, age, diet, obesity, alcohol intake, race, or tobacco use. Porphyromonas, Solobacterium, Haemophilus, Corynebacterium, Cellulosimicrobium, Streptococcus and Campylobacter are some of the genera found in the saliva.  Genetic markers and diagnostic testing  \\"There is high diversity in the salivary microbiome within and between individuals, but little geographic structure. Overall, ‚àº13.5% of the total variance in the composition of genera is due to differences among individuals, which is remarkably similar to the fraction of the total variance in neutral genetic markers that can be attributed to differences among human populations.\\" \\"[E]nvironmental variables revealed a significant association between the genetic distances among locations and the distance of each location from the equator. Further characterization of the enormous diversity revealed here in the human salivary microbiome will aid in elucidating the role it plays in human health and disease, and in the identification of potentially informative species for studies of human population history.\\" Sixty new genera have been identified from the salivary glands. A total of 101 different genera were identified in the salivary glands. Out of these, 39 genera are not found in the oral microbiome. It is not known whether the resident species remain constant or change. Though the association between the salivary microbiome is similar to that of the oral microbiome, there also exists an association the salivary microbiome and the gut microbiome. Saliva sampling may be a non- invasive way to detect changes in the gut microbiome and changes in systemic disease. The association between the salivary microbiome those with Polycistic Ovarian Syndrome has been characterized: \\"saliva microbiome profiles correlate with those in the stool, despite the fact that the bacterial communities in the two locations differ greatly. Therefore, saliva may be a useful alternative to stool as an indicator of bacterial dysbiosis in systemic disease.\\" The sugar concentration in salivary secretions can vary. Blood sugar levels are reflected in salivary gland secretions. High salivary glucose (HSG) levels are a glucose concentration ‚â• 1.0 mg/d, n = 175) and those with low salivary glucose (LSG) levels are < 0.1 mg/dL n = 2,537). Salivary gland secretions containing high levels of sugar change the oral microbiome and contributes to an environment that is conductive to the formation of dental caries and gingivitis. Salivary glands Salivary glands: 1.parotid, 2.submandibular, 3.sublingual. Organisms of the salivary microbiome reside in the three major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual. These glands secrete electrolytes, proteins, genetic material, polysaccharides, and other molecules. Most of these substances enter the salivary gland acinus and duct system from surrounding capillaries via the intervening tissue fluid, although some substances are produced within the glands themselves. The level of each salivary component varies considerably depending on the health status of the individual and the presence of pathogenic and commensal organisms.

During World War II, he served as Resident- General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief in French North Africa. Nogu√®s was appalled by news that the French government was seeking an armistice with Germany. On 17 June 1940 he telegraphed to Bordeaux, where the government was then situated: \\"The whole of North Africa is appalled. The troops beg to continue the struggle if the government has no objection. I am ready to take responsibility for this attitude with all the risks that it entails,\\" i.e. asking for a hint to carry on fighting. However, he did not approve of General Charles de Gaulle's call from London in 18 June to carry on fighting, telling the British liaison officer that he thought de Gaulle's attitude \\"unseemly\\" and forbidding the North African press from publishing de Gaulle's appeal.Lacouture 1991, pp. 229‚Äì230 Nogu√®s accepted the armistice on 22 June, partly (he claimed) because Admiral Francois Darlan would not let him have the French fleet to continue hostilities against the Axis powers. He eventually agreed under pressure from Maxime Weygand's emissary General Louis Koeltz, telegraphing Weygand: \\"it covers me with shame\\". In 1940, R√©sident G√©n√©ral Charles Nogu√®s implemented antisemitic decrees coming from Nazi-controlled Vichy government excluding Jews from public functions.

History Before the start of the Syrian Civil War, Suhail served in the Syrian Arab Army, which he defected from in 2011 to join the opposition. After joining the rebels, he participated in the battles in Idlib Governorate, including on Jabal Zawiya. In a 2016 interview with al- Monitor, he said, \\"I was trained in the Syrian army to use the Russian Malyutka and red-arrow anti-armor missiles, which are not so different from the TOW missiles but do not enjoy the same precision, so I gained experience in dealing with all anti-shield missiles both in terms of structure and trajectory and regardless of their points of strength or weakness.\\" Elaborating on his success with anti-tank missiles, he said, \\"I destroyed around 70 targets, of which 57 machineries were destroyed through TOW missiles and 11 machineries through the Malyutka missiles. These targets included planes, tanks, armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers in addition to DShK machine guns.\\" Before joining the Sham Legion, he was a fighter in the Hazzm Movement and later the 101st Infantry Division, the 1st Coastal Division and 13th Division. All of these groups have received support from the United States, including with provisions of BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles. All of these groups are mainstream, non-sectarian rebel factions under the brand of the Free Syrian Army. While a member of the Hazzm Movement, he fought battles against al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front between 2014 and 2015. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning, Suhail was known for his hatred of Nusra Front,‚Äù according to his friend Ahmad Barakat, interviewed by The Daily Beast. He was protected from being kidnapped by Nusra, ‚Äúbecause of his popularity and his great effect on the battlefield ‚Ä¶ Regime troops used to get scared when they heard Abu TOW was participating in a battle; this was something we would hear on the wireless handhelds.‚Äù According to Barakat, Abu TOW has been the subject of several assassination attempts by the al-Nusra Front. In April or May 2017, Suhail uploaded pictures of himself smoking in front of a Tahrir al-Sham sign which stated \\"Smoking is haram\\". He uploaded another picture of him with duct tape in front of an HTS sign saying \\"No to a truce because it is sedition\\". While driving in the village of Ihsim, he was arrested by HTS. When he went to the HTS police in the village of Marayan the following day, he was accused of ‚Äúderision of religion.‚Äù He was arrested by the HTS security branch and taken to a prison. An attempt by a delegation of Hamoud's Sham Legion fighters to negotiate his release was unsuccessful. Hammoud's relative was told was that he would appear before an HTS judge. Leaders of several Free Syrian Army-affiliated groups have privately petitioned HTS to release Hammoud. On May 13, 2017, it was reported that he was released from custody. On 10 February 2020, Hammoud returned to Idlib Governorate to participate in military operations against the Syrian army for the first time since his release. On 18 March 2020, Hammoud was the target of a kidnapping attempt in the city of Idlib. He was shot in the foot, but the assailants were engaged by people accompanying him. HTS was blamed for the attack, but has denied this. After being hospitalized, Hammoud left Idlib governorate for northern Aleppo.

This decision, together with an academic article written by Roy Goode,Goode, R.M., Charges over book debts: a missed opportunity, (1994) 110 LQR 592 is sometimes looked upon as the turning point in relation to the stricter requirements in relation to control of the proceeds of book debts and other future receivables laid down in subsequent cases. Facts Brookes Associates Finance Limited was in the business of providing equipment under hire purchase agreements. In 1992 Royal Trust Bank (called RTB in the judgment) extended finance to the company, and took a deed of charge under which the company purported to charge the benefit of certain hire purchase agreements deposited with RTB. Those deeds of charge required all sums paid to the company under the hire purchase agreement to be deposited into a specified bank account which the company was required to open with RTB. No such bank account was ever opened, and the company deposited the sums received under those contracts into an account with National Westminster Bank, which it was free to draw upon. Although some sums were paid to RTB from that account in repayment of the loans, when the company entered into financial difficulty, NatWest Bank blocked the account. RTB sued NatWest Bank alleging that it held the sums in that account as constructive trustee for RTB. The company did not appear and was not represented. At first instance noted that he had been advised that it was in receivership at the time of the hearing. The case came before Jonathan Parker J who decided in favour of RTB. NatWest Bank then appealed to the Court of Appeal. Decision Nourse LJ gave the lead judgment in the Court of Appeal, and allowed the appeal on the basis that the company had at all times been free to deal with the proceeds in those accounts, and thus it was never a trustee of them. Accordingly, it was not material what notice NatWest Bank had or had not received - it could not become a constructive trustee. However, the case is probably more famous for the short decision of Millett LJ. Millet LJ noted that the trial judge had determined that the charge created was a fixed charge, and that no appeal had been made against that finding. However, he was satisfied that this was not correct, and that the proper construction of the charge was a floating charge. Accordingly, the company was free to deal with the proceeds of the hire purchase contracts as it saw fit, including paying them over to NatWest Bank, which meant that NatWest Bank was at liberty to apply them to the company's indebtedness to it pursuant to the banker's right to combine accounts. Millet LJ held: Authority The decision of Millet LJ is sometimes looked upon as a turning point in the characterisation of charges over book debts (as either fixed or floating) from the more permissive approach taken in earlier decisions like Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142 and Re New Bullas Trading Ltd [1994] 1 BCLC 485, to the stricter approach evident in later cases such as (where Lord Millett gave the opinion of the Privy Council) and .

Early life and education  William G. Read Mullan was born on January 28, 1860 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States to John P. and Emily Susannah Mullan (n√©e Adam). His father was a sexton at the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore, as was his father before him. He was named after an orator and family friend William G. Read Jr. A great-great aunt on his father's side, Catharine Mullan, was one of the first to join Elizabeth Ann Seton and the Sisters of Charity. As a child, Mullan completed his primary education at the parochial school at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Baltimore. He began attending Loyola College in Maryland in 1874, graduating in 1877. Shortly before graduating, he applied for admission to the Society of Jesus. In 1877, he was admitted as a postulant and commenced studies at the Jesuit novitiate in Frederick, Maryland, where he remained until 1880. From 1880 to 1883, he studied rhetoric, philosophy, and science at Woodstock College, a Jesuit seminary in Woodstock, Maryland. In 1888, after five years teaching at Fordham University and Georgetown University, Mullan returned to Woodstock College where he was educated in theology. In 1890 (one source dates it to 1892), he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal James Gibbons, the Archbishop of Baltimore.  Career  After novitiate, Mullan taught classics and literature at St. John's College (now Fordham University) for four years, before becoming a professor of poetry at Georgetown University for one year. After returning to Woodstock College for his theological education, he returned to Fordham as Prefect of Studies, where he remained until 1897. Later, he returned to Woodstock College as Superior of Scholastics, before becoming a professor at the College of the Holy Cross. In 1898, Mullan was appointed President of Boston College. He arrived on June 30, 1898, and received the books from his predecessor, Timothy Brosnahan. As president, he worked to ensure rigorous academic standards and took interest in the personal development of his students. He also served concurrently as rector of the Church of the Immaculate Conception. In addition to his administrative duties, Mullan vigorously fought against anti-Catholicism in American academia. Most notably, he became involved in the controversy of President of Harvard University Charles W. Elliot's criticism of Boston College and Catholic education in general. Mullan protested Harvard Law School's removal of Boston College from its list of acceptable institutions for admission as a regular student, as well as Elliot's comments disparaging Jesuit universities. He combated this through private and public correspondence and through public speeches. As president, Mullan also established the Sodality of Catholic College Alumni in 1900. He founded the organization after sending a letter on May 13, 1899, to all Boston College alumni, which read: > \\"I should be much pleased to meet the lay alumni of Boston College ... for > the purpose of proposing to them the formation of a Sodality to be composed > exclusively of Catholic graduates of Boston College and other colleges. I am > fully convinced that such a gathering of educated Catholic men could be a > power in the community to attract respect for our holy religion and for > Catholic Education.\\" Mullan served as President of Boston College until 1903. After leaving Boston College, he served as a prefect at Fordham. He also became the vice president and prefect of studies at the Graduate School of Georgetown University. In 1907, Mullan became President of Loyola College in Maryland, but resigned because of ill health six months into his term. He was admitted to St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, where he remained until his death.  Death and legacy  Mullan died at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore on January 25, 1910 at the age of 49, three days before his 50th birthday. He was buried at Woodstock Jesuit Cemetery in Woodstock, Maryland. After his death, a scholarship was created in his memory at Loyola College in Maryland. The $1,000 Read Mullan Scholarship was funded through collections by the Sodality of St. Ignatius Church in Baltimore, under the direction of Rev. John D. Whitney, SJ.

An area of low pressure developed in early October, and it became a tropical depression on October 9. The depression strengthened to a tropical storm one day later, and it received the name Charlotte from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The system strengthened quickly and became a typhoon eighteen hours later. Charlotte continued to rapidly strengthen to its peak of on October 13. The typhoon began to weaken afterwards, and it traveled south of Okinawa on October 16. The typhoon weakened to a tropical storm on October 19 as it began its extratropical transition. The storm became extratropical later that day, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) ceased tracking the system on October 20. During October 16 and 17, Charlotte caused heavy damage to the Okinawa Islands. Large amounts of rainfall caused landslides across the islands and many rice and sugar cane crops were destroyed by floods. Multiple public buildings and 800 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving over 1,000 people homeless. Damage done to military bases on the island amounted to $300,000 (). 46 people died during the storm in the islands. Minor damage was also reported in Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, mostly due to flooding and strong winds.

JMA continued to track the cyclone until 0600 UTC of October 20. Preparations and impact On October 15, preparations were made by the United States Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa. Marines, including the ones in the 3rd division at Camp Sukiran and Camp Schwab, were moved to storm shelters from their tents and Quonset huts. Only security guards in tanks and amphibious tractors remained outside of the shelters. On October 17, twelve freighters sought shelter in the harbor at Kagoshima, and seventy small craft moved to other protected areas within Japan. In northern Luzon and the Batanes of the Philippines, heavy rain and strong winds were reported. Similar conditions happened in Taiwan, where little damage happened. In Tokyo, winds were reported, and several streets and 31 homes were flooded. A large fleet of British ships, led by HMS Alert, arrived at Yokohama after being delayed by typhoons Charlotte and Dinah.

There has been a church on the site since the 12th century. The current building was completed in 1815 and is Grade II* listed. In the grounds, which hold the Green Flag Award, are some fine tombs including many early 19th century sarcophagi and a community garden, Eden. The incumbent is Revd Canon Jonathan Boardman. History The original parish church of Clapham was St Mary's Church which dated from the 12th century. St Mary's was renamed Trinity Church after the Reformation. It was taken down under an act of Parliament in 1774 and a new Holy Trinity Church was built on Clapham Common in 1775. The north aisle of the former church was left standing for the performance of burials. St Paul's Church was built at the beginning of the 19th century on the site of the former St Mary's/Holy Trinity Church. The building was completed in 1815 as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity, Clapham. It was assigned a separate Ecclesiastical District in 1861.https://lmaweb.minisisinc.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail?SESSIONSEARCH&exp;=refd P95/PAU1 =Architecture= The architect was either C. Edmonds or Christopher Edwards. The church was built from stock brick, with a fairly low pitched slate roof and is in the classical style. The original construction was a plain rectangular building with interior galleries at the west end and sides. In 1875, the church was extended at the east end by Sir Arthur Blomfield with a transept, a chancel and lower half octagonal apse. St Paul's is a cruciform church with a west entrance porch and a wide nave with aisles. The Victorian chancel and transept by Blomfield have round arched windows with roll moulding and pediments at each end of the transept. The side galleries were removed in 1928. The most severe damage caused to the church by the bombing during World War II occurred on the night of 10 May, 1941. Incendiary bombs lodged in the roof and burned through before they could be extinguished, damaging the chancel and sanctuary. The building was completely restored and redecorated after the war and on 14 July 1955, the church was designated a grade II* listed building.. Following a further internal reorganization in 1970, the south semitransept is now a Lady chapel. =Present day= St Paul's stands in the central tradition of the Church of England. The parish of St. Paul, Clapham is part of Archdeaconry of Lambeth in the Diocese of Southwark. Organ The pipe organ at St Paul's was built in 1886 by Forster and Andrews. The organ originally stood in the south semitransept, the current location of the Lady Chapel, before the 1970 reorganisation of the building. A complete, historically congruent rebuild of the organ was finished in 2019 by Andrew Cooper & Co. Ltd. Community Centre The East End extension designed by Blomfield was converted into a community centre in 1970, reducing the church to its original size. The centre is home to a Montessori nursery school and a number of user groups including a community choir. The church is used as a performance space by an opera company , a chamber music ensemble and for theatrical productions by Paul's Players. Churchyard The churchyard was closed for burials in 1854. Among those buried in the churchyard were Roundhead soldiers killed in the English Civil War. The churchyard has largely been cleared of gravestones but the Revd TC Dale made a record in the 1920s of all gravestones and monumental inscriptions existing at the time. The churchyard is home to \\"Eden at St. Paul's\\", a popular community garden. It is one of Lambeth's longest standing Green Flag Award-winning sites.

Criminal remedies for copyright infringement prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted works by defining certain violations of copyright to be criminal wrongs which are liable to be prosecuted and punished by the state. Unlike civil remedies, which are obtained through private civil actions initiated by the owner of the copyright, criminal remedies are secured by the state which prosecutes the infringing individual or organisation. The criminal penalties imposed for copyright infringement vary between the copyright laws of different jurisdictions. However, the justifications for the imposition of criminal penalties are common in the sense that certain kinds of copyright violations are considered as egregious enough to warrant state interference. These kinds of copyright violations are seen as having a negative consequence affecting the entire community. A criminal conviction for copyright infringement is also more punitive compared to a civil penalty and this increases the value of the punishment as a deterrent to prevent such violations in the future. For these reasons, criminal penalties for copyright infringement are considered to be effective sanctions against violations. Internationally, Article 61 of the TRIPS Agreement requires member nations to provide for criminal procedures and penalties \\"at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale\\". In addition to the coming into force of the TRIPS Agreement, the rapid development of computer software during the 1990s led to a significant expansion in the degree and imposition of criminal penalties for copyright infringement, especially in the decades towards the end of the 20th century. The scope for copyright infringement of electronic material has proliferated following the advent of the Internet and this has become an underpinning reason for calls by copyright owners to increase reliance on criminal penalties which have a deterrent effect. Nevertheless, there have also been arguments by scholars for reducing the severity of criminal copyright infringement penalties since such penalties could result in monopolistic profits for the copyright owner.  In the U.S.  = Legislative history = Criminal provisions for copyright infringement were initially inserted into U.S. Copyright Law in 1897.Act of January 6, 1897, ch. 4, 29 Stat. 481-82. But this crime was limited only to unlawful performances or representations of copyrighted dramatic works or musical compositions. The apparent reasoning behind such a narrow criminal provision was because of the difficulty faced by copyright owners of such works in detecting and punishing infringements of their works since these infringements were perpetrated by \\"hit and run\\"performing groups in remote areas far away from the location of the copyright owner's place of residence or work. The criminal intent or mens rea that is required to be shown in case of any criminal offence of copyright infringement was also provided for in the 1897 law and it had to be shown that the conduct of the infringing party was both \\"wilful\\" and \\"for profit.\\" The U.S. Congress expanded the scope of the criminal remedies in the Copyright Act of 1909 by applying criminal provisions to infringements of all kinds of copyrighted works under the statute except sound recordings.Section 28, Copyright Act of 1909, available at https://www.copyright.gov/history/1909act.pdf Once again, the mens rea requirement for conviction of a criminal offence necessitated that the infringement was done \\"wilfully\\" and \\"for profit.\\" This confined most criminal convictions to large-scale commercial activities. Additionally, any person who \\"knowingly and wilfully\\" aided or abetted such infringement was also criminally liable under the statute. The criminal offences under the Copyright Act of 1909 were punishable as misdemeanours and entailed either imprisonment or fines at the discretion of the court. The criminal provisions under the old copyright law were interpreted rather generously by the judiciary and the evidentiary requirement of \\"for profit\\" was glossed over to mean that the infringing defendant's activities only needed to be for \\"the purpose\\" of profit and no actual generation of profits was necessary. Subsequently, in 1971, following lobbying by the sound recording industry, the U.S. Congress extended federal copyright protection to sound recordings as well vide the Sound Recording Act of 1971.Sound Recording Act of 1971, Pub. L. No. 92-140, 85 Stat. 391 (1971), amended by Pub. L. No. 93-573, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974) (codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 102). This consequently led to criminal penalties being made available against wilful and for-profit infringement of sound recordings. = Existing criminal copyright law = The criminal remedies for copyright infringement in the U.S. have been increasingly expanded in both scope and degree by legislative measures following the software and digital revolution beginning in the early 1990s.  U.S. Copyright Act of 1976  In 1976, the U.S. Congress carried out, till date, the most recent general revision of the U.S. copyright law and the Copyright Act of 1976 was brought into force.Copyright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (codified at 17 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 101-801). The Copyright Act of 1976 is the copyright law currently in force in the U.S. While this Act continued to provide for criminal remedies to copyright infringement, it removed the crime of aiding or abetting such infringement which had been included in the 1909 statute. The mens rea requirement was also amended. Previously, under the 1909 statute, a person was criminally liable for copyright infringement if he or she committed the infringement \\"wilfully\\" and \\"for profit\\". While \\"wilful\\" commission of the infringement continued to remain a requirement for proving mens rea, the words \\"for profit\\" were amended to read as \\"for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.\\" Section 506(a) of the U.S. Copyright Act, 1976 (Title 17 of the U.S. Code) defines the offence of criminal infringement. However, the punishments prescribed for criminal copyright infringements are laid down under Section 2319 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). This segregation initially came about in 1982 following representations by the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. and the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. that called for an increase in penalties for film and sound recording piracy and counterfeiting. These two trade associations asserted that civil infringement actions had little to no effect in deterring criminals engaged in piracy and counterfeiting activities of motion pictures and sound recordings and, moreover, that the modest penalties imposed for criminal infringement discouraged efforts to enforce the same. The U.S. Congress responded to these industrial copyright concerns by restructuring the criminal remedies for copyright infringement and by enacting certain felony provisions for copyright infringement under Section 2319 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code.Act of May 24, 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-180, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 96 Star. 91. These criminal copyright infringement provisions have been periodically amended in line with current developments and now encompass all copyrighted works. Most notably, Section 2319 of U.S.C. Title 18 was significantly amended by the Copyright Felony Act of 1992 which imposed felony penalties for mass piracy of all types of copyrighted works including computer programs while simultaneously lowering the threshold for imposing felony penalties.Copyright Felony Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-561, 106 Stat. 4233 (1992). The criminal penalties under Section 2319 of 18 U.S.C. consist of substantially prohibitive sanctions comprising either imprisonment or fines or both. Section 506(b) also provides for the criminal forfeiture of the infringing property and subsequent destruction of the same at the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings.  Notable Amendments to the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976  = No Electronic Theft Act of 1997 = The No Electronic Theft (NET) Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress and came into effect in 1997. This Act amended Section 506 of the U.S. Copyright Act and the corresponding sections of the federal criminal code (Title 18 of the U.S. Code) in order to prohibit large-scale copyright infringement through the Internet. The NET Act revised Section 506 in order to close the \\"LaMacchia Loophole\\" which had emerged following the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in the case of United States v. LaMacchia in 1994. Prior to the enactment of the NET Act, the law required that, in order to prosecute for criminal copyright infringement, the infringement be carried out for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain. In the LaMacchia decision, the district court cast doubt on the effectiveness of the law by ruling that the commission of copyright infringement for non-commercial motives cannot be prosecuted under criminal copyright law. The NET Act removed this loophole by defining the term \\"financial gain\\" to include \\"the receipt of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works\\" and enabling prosecutors to pursue criminal infringement suits against infringers even in the absence of any private financial gain provided that the reproduction or distribution (even through electronic means) of the copies of the copyrighted works have a total retail value of more than $1000.No Electronic Theft (NET) Act, 111 Stat. 2678 Public Law 105‚Äì14 ‚Äî Dec. 16, 1997 = Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 = In 1998, the U.S. Congress adopted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860 (1998) (codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 512, 1201-1205, 1301-1332 & 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 4001 (2012)). which introduced criminal anti- circumvention provisions to prevent copyright infringement. This Act was enacted to implement the provisions of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty in the U.S. and to prevent circumvention of Digital Rights Management systems. Section 1204 of the U.S. Copyright Act imposes serious criminal penalties on persons who wilfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, circumvent technological protection measures or traffic in any such circumvention technology. The DMCA distinguishes between first-time offenders and repeat offenders and the criminal sanctions that can be imposed are either imprisonment or fines, or both. = Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act of 2004 = The U.S. Congress adopted the Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act (also known as the Anti-Counterfeiting Amendments Act) in 2004.Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act, Pub. L. No. 108-482, 118 Stat. 3912 (2004) (amending 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2318) This law expanded criminal penalties to criminalize trafficking of counterfeit copyrighted works. The criminal remedies available under the Act include imprisonment for a term of not more than five years or a fine or both. = Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 = In 2005, the U.S. Congress adopted the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act which criminally penalised the wilful reproduction of works for commercial distribution.Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-9, 119 Stat. 218 (2005) (codified as 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2319B (2012). More specifically, it prohibited the recording of copyrighted audiovisual works like movies without the prior permission of the copyright owner from the public performance of such works in a theatre or other similar facility. This Act distinguishes between first-time offenders and repeat offenders and the criminal sanctions include a fine and/or imprisonment. = Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 (Pro-IP Act) = The Pro-IP Act, adopted by the U.S. Congress in 2008, markedly amended the U.S. copyright law concerning criminal remedies by converting to felonies many copyright infringement offences that were previously considered misdemeanours. This enhanced the criminal sanctions for infringements classified as felony offences.  In India  Chapter XIII (Sections 63 to 70) of the Indian Copyright Act of 1957 addresses the subject of criminal offences for copyright violations in India. Section 63 of the Indian Copyright Act is the primary provision imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement or the violation of any other right conferred under the Indian Copyright Act. The mens rea requirement under the Indian law states that a person must \\"knowingly\\" infringe or abet the infringement of a copyrighted work. In contrast to the U.S. Copyright Act which removed criminal sanctions for abetting copyright infringement, a person who abets another in the infringement of a copyrighted work under the Indian copyright law is liable to criminal sanctions as per Section 63. A crucial difference between the Indian copyright law and the U.S. copyright law is that the Indian law prescribes both imprisonment and fine to be imposed by the court in case of a criminal copyright offences whereas the U.S. law allows the court to impose imprisonment and/or a fine. The Indian legislative policy regarding criminal copyright violations appears to favour imprisonment as a mandatory criminal sanction for copyright offences. However, the proviso to Section 63 allows the court to impose a lower punishment with regard to the term of imprisonment and the amount of fine if the infringement was not made for gain the course of trade or business. Section 63A of the Indian Copyright Act prescribes an enhanced penalty for repeat offenders of copyright infringement. There has, however, been slight disagreement between the High Courts in India regarding question of whether a criminal offence is bailable or is non-bailable. The Delhi High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court have held that offences under Section 63 and 63A are bailable. But, the Gauhati High Court has stated such criminal offences to be non-bailable. Furthermore, the Kerala High Court has held criminal offences under Section 63 to be cognizable in nature, meaning that a police officer may arrest an accused without a warrant for the alleged commission of a criminal offence under the Indian Copyright Act. Section 63B of the Indian Copyright Act was inserted by the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 1994 and it classifies the knowing use of an infringing copy of a computer programme by any person as an offence which is punishable with both fine as well as imprisonment. Where the computer programme has not been used for gain or in the course of trade or business, the court may, after recording its reasons, not impose any sentence of imprisonment and can reduce the amount of the minimum fine prescribed. Section 64 of the Indian Copyright Act affords power to a police officer, who is above or at the rank of a sub- inspector, to seize without warrant any infringing copies of copyrighted material if he or she believes that an offence under Section 63 is being, or is likely to be, committed. The constitutional validity of the power afforded to a police officer by this provision was upheld by the Rajasthan High Court in Girish Gandhi v. Union of India. Cognizance of offences under the Indian Copyright Act can only be taken by a Court of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class. = Digital Rights Management provisions under the Indian copyright law = The Indian Copyright Act has two provisions to prevent circumvention of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems. Sections 65A and 65B were both inserted following the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2012. Section 65A deals with the protection of technological measures and imposes criminal sanctions on any person who circumvents an effective technological measure with the intention of infringing any of the rights conferred by the Indian Copyright Act. Note that Section 65A requires the mens rea element of \\"intention\\" to be shown and proved for a conviction under the said Section. This is a fairly high bar for conviction which is in contradistinction to the U.S. Copyright Act (as amended by the DMCA) which does not require proof of \\"intention\\" in case of a circumvention of a technological measure by any person. The DMCA effectively classifies this kind of an offence as a strict liability offence. Compared to the DMCA, the exceptions under the Indian Copyright Act are also much broader since: # Section 65A does not prohibit any person from doing anything for a purpose not expressly prohibited under the Indian Copyright Act; # Section 65A allows third parties to facilitate circumvention of a technological protection measure provided that the third party maintains a complete record of the details and the purpose for which such circumvention was facilitated; and # It specifically exempts from criminal liability the circumvention of technological measures for the purpose of certain activities as listed under Section 65A. Section 65B addresses the issue of protection of Right Management Information and imposes a criminal sanction consisting of both imprisonment as well as fine on any person who knowingly commits such offence. The criminal penalties provided for under this section are in addition to the civil remedies provide for under Chapter XII of the Act. The DRM provisions introduced by the 2012 Amendment of the Indian Copyright Act have been criticised by certain commentators since India is not a party to either the WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty and had no obligation to enact such provisions. In effect, these two provisions have been criticised for creating a para-copyright regime which affords greater protection to DRM-protected works while detrimentally affecting the fair dealing defence available to the general public under Section 52 of the Indian Copyright Act.

Nightscout software aims to give users access to their real time blood sugar data by putting this data in the cloud. In addition to browser-based data visualization, Nightscout can also be used to review data from a phone or smartwatch, or to remotely monitor CGM data for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Associated with Nightscout software is a broader \\"CGM in the Cloud\\" social movement, supporting individuals seeking to access and use realtime CGM data through commercial and do-it-yourself (DIY) approaches.  History  The Nightscout Project traces its origin to February 2013, when the parents of a 4-year-old boy newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes began using a continuous glucose monitoring system. This data was inaccessible to the parents when the child was at school - there was no commercially available way to access the data in real time. The boy's father, John Costik, a software engineer, developed software to access and transfer CGM data to cloud computing infrastructure. Costik shared his accomplishment on Twitter and, after others expressed interest, privately shared the source code. Costik's uploader was expanded by Lane Desborough and Ross Naylor, to develop \\"Nightscout\\": adding a blood glucose chart display that could be viewed throughout a home. Further development to make the software accessible to the general public occurred within a private community of developers, including Ben West, Ross Naylor, Kevin Lee, Jason Calabrese, Jason Adams, and Toby Canning. Because this software was, in effect, an unlicensed medical device, the community delayed releasing the code as open source to explore and address legal concerns. Once this was done, the combined code was released in 2014 as the Nightscout Project. A website and Facebook groups were also created to support new users. The primary Facebook group for the movement is \\"CGM in the Cloud\\", broadly supporting individuals seeking to use realtime CGM data, via commercial and/or DIY methods. As of May 2017, this group has over 23,000 members. In addition a related 501(c)(3) organization, Nightscout Foundation, was formed in 2014 to encourage and support open source technology projects for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes. The #WeAreNotWaiting hashtag used by the group was initially coined by Lane Desborough and Howard Look, in reference to call for a \\"diabetes data exchange\\" hosted by Tidepool and DiabetesMine in November 2013. A survey of the Nightscout community indicated that the software was most highly used by parents of young children with type 1 diabetes (less than 12 years of age), but is also used by adolescents and adults.  Regulatory concerns  Because Nightscout software displays information relevant to medical care, there are safety concerns regarding reliability, liability, and regulation. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expressed concern that a singular entity was needed to review code, monitor safety, and respond to issues. As of 2016, no such entity had arisen, beyond the unstructured approach of community communication channels (e.g. Facebook group and Gitter channel). As a non-commercial open source project, Nightscout software has not been regulated by the FDA. The software is released with a strong disclaimer:  Commercial alternatives  In 2015, subsequent to the development of the Nightscout Project, Dexcom released a CGM system that included 'Share', providing software for transferring data to cell phones via Bluetooth, and sharing CGM data with others via cell phone apps. In 2017, a Spanish company Instead Technologies launched a continuous reading system for the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor, called GlucoAngel.  Related projects  The OpenAPS project has extended Nightscout to create a do-it- yourself \\"artificial pancreas\\", by automating basal insulin delivery by an insulin pump to create a \\"closed loop\\" system.

Reichskriege) was a war fought by the Holy Roman Empire as a whole against an opponent. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, a Reichskrieg was a formal state of war that could only be declared by the Imperial Diet. There were two kinds of Reichskrieg with two different legal bases. The first was a Reichsexekutionskrieg, a military action of the empire against one of its own Imperial Estates (Reichst√§nde). This could only be done after one of the empire's two supreme courts, the Imperial Chamber Court or the Imperial Aulic Council, had found the offending estate to be in breach of the peace, and the estate was too powerful to be subdued by the Imperial Circle to which it belonged. The second kind of Reichskrieg was that against another sovereign state that had violated the empire's rights or frontiers. After 1519, the emperors were bound to get the support of the Imperial Electors prior to declaring war on another state. From 1648, they required the approval of the diet for both kinds of war. The only state against which a formal Reichskrieg was ever declared was France. The diet declared war on France in 1689, 1702, 1734, 1793 and 1799. The declaration created a state of war, but it was still necessary for the emperor by a series of orders to begin the decentralised process of forming the Reichsarmee (Imperial Army) out of the Imperial Circles' troops. What each estate owed in both money and men was determined by the Imperial Military Constitution. Middle Ages In the Middle Ages, the formal mechanisms of imperial war did not yet exist. Historians still sometimes speak of imperial wars, such as that declared by the Emperor Sigismund against duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1434, or that declared against the Armagnacs by the Emperor Frederick III in 1444. Imperial reforms, 1495‚Äì1519 At the Diet of Worms in 1495, the emperor was prohibited from making war in the name of the empire without first consulting the Imperial Diet. His right to make war in his own name and with his own resources was not restricted. This was the first restriction on the emperor's war-making powers, and it introduced the concept of a war fought by the whole empire as distinct from a war fought privately by the emperor. The 1495 diet also declared an Eternal Peace and instituted a supreme court, the Imperial Chamber Court. These acts outlawed private warfare and feuds, and created a binding judicial mechanism for dispute resolution. This had the effect of making civil wars a matter of breaching the imperial peace (Reichsfriedensbruch) to be resolved by the courts. It was illegal for any Imperial Estate to assist another that was breaching the peace. Following court rulings, the emperor could issue an \\"advocates' mandate\\" (mandatum advocatorium) that identified estates in breach of the peace as \\"enemies of the empire\\" (Reichsfeinde) and required other estates to act to bring the enemy to heel. Thus, after a judicial process, the empire could make war on one of its own members that was in breach of the peace. Charles V in his Wahlkapitulation (electoral capitulation) of 1519 agreed not to declare war without the consent of the electors. This represented a loosening of the restriction imposed in 1495. Turkish wars (T√ºrkenkriege), 1529‚Äì1791 In the early modern period, a fundamental difference was introduced to the empire between wars against fellow Christians and wars against non-Christians, which, in the imperial context, meant the Ottoman Turks. Between 1529 and 1699, the empire was in a constant state of war with the Ottomans, punctuated only by temporary truces that usually involved the payment of tribute to the Ottomans. This permanent state of war followed from the Ottoman division of world between the lands of Islam and the \\"house of war\\". These wars attracted support from both Catholic and Protestant Europe. Although they had the support of the Papacy, they were never declared crusades. Owing to the impossibility of peace, the right of the emperor to demand assistance in the war against the Ottomans was unquestioned. In the 1520s the Imperial Diet asserted its right to debate the level of the \\"Turkish aid\\" (T√ºrkenhilfe), but not its requirement. Since the state of war did not require approval by the Imperial Diet, there was also no question of the emperor's right to demand assistance from those imperial states, like Bohemia and Italy, that did not participate in the diet. During the active phases of the long war, bells would be rung in churches throughout the empire at noon to remind subjects to pray for the success of the imperial armies, a practice known as the \\"Turkish bells\\" (T√ºrkenglocken). The Diet voted to raise imperial troops for the Turkish war five times before the Peace of Zsitvatorok ended the Long Turkish War in 1606. An imperial army was thus in the field, often outside of the empire's borders, in 1532, 1542, 1552, 1566‚Äì67 and 1593‚Äì1606. During the last war, the imperial troops also undertook garrison duty on the Croatian Military Frontier. In 1544, the Diet of Speyer declared France to be an \\"enemy of the empire\\" (Reichsfeind) on account of its alliance with the Ottomans. This permitted the emperor to make war against France on behalf of the empire, but it was an unusual step and one not repeated for over a century. A permanent peace was finally agreed in the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), although there were subsequent wars against the Ottomans in 1716‚Äì18, 1736‚Äì39 and 1787‚Äì91. The Turkish bells were rung in 1716‚Äì18 and 1736‚Äì39, but the idea was rejected in 1787‚Äì91 as out of step with the Enlightenment. Evolution of the Reichskrieg, 1618‚Äì1688 During the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48), no Reichskrieg was ever declared. The emperor made war by means of advocates' mandates. Imperial estates signed treaties with the emperor and with each other to provide armies as required. The Treaty of Osnabr√ºck of 1648 restricted the right of the emperor to make war in the empire's name‚Äîeither against external foes or internal violators of the peace‚Äîwithout permission from the Imperial Diet. The first war waged in the empire's name after 1648 was the war against the Ottomans in 1663‚Äì64. It is commonly said that the Emperor Leopold I obtained a declaration of Reichskrieg (or Reichskriegserkl√§rung) against France in 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War, In fact, Leopold had expelled the French ambassador to the Empire from Regensburg in March 1674 and informed the diet that he considered France an enemy of the Empire. Taking advantage of the general anti-French mood, he secured the diet's sanction of imperial aid to the Electoral Palatinate and other territories threatened by the French on 31 March. In April and May, the emperor issued further decrees implementing the diet's grant of aid. His decision not to call for a Reichskrieg forced him to lean heavily on the militarised princes and thus further increased their standing and influence in the Empire. Although the diet, at the suggestion of the French king, Louis XIV, considered sending its own representative to the peace conference at Nijmegen in 1675‚Äì76, this was vetoed by Leopold, who asserted that since it was not a Reichskrieg he retained full authority to negotiate on the empire's behalf. This set a precedent that was upheld even in future Reichskriege in 1697 and 1714: the emperor could negotiate peace without the diet. The negotiated treaty, however, had still to be ratified by the diet. In 1681, the Imperial Diet approved a triple quota of Imperial Circle troops (Kreistruppen) for the relief of Vienna, but as it was a war against the Turks no declaration of Reichskrieg was necessary. In the same year, in response to military flaws exposed during the Dutch War, the diet passed a law on military organization that formed the basis of the Imperial Military Constitution until the end of the empire. Wars against France =1689= Between 1672 and 1688, the emperor employed advocates' mandates against Louis XIV of France. When in 1688 Louis invaded the Palatinate, the whole empire mobilized against him. Then, on 11 February 1689, the Imperial Diet approved a declaration of war against France. On 3 April 1689, Leopold I issued advocates' mandates putting the declaration into effect. This had the effect of converting the Kreistruppen into a true Reichsarmee, although the actual process by which this was done was highly decentralised and required the issuance of old-fashioned advocates' mandates. Despite this, the Empire did not join the Grand Alliance in May 1689, although the emperor did on his own behalf as ruler of Austria and Hungary. The declaration of war of 1689 was revolutionary. The precedent of 1544 had not been forgotten, and the war with the Ottomans was raging in the east. The declaration of war on France sought to build morale and rally support by equating the Christian French to the Muslims Turks. =1702= On 30 September 1702, the Imperial Diet voted a triple quota (triplum or 120,000 men) for defence against France. In November, it formally declared war on France. Two of the electors‚ÄîJoseph Clemens of Cologne and Maximilian Emanuel of Bavaria‚Äîsided openly with France and were thus in breach of imperial law. Already in November, the Reichshofrat heard the case against them and recommended that the other electors be consulted about outlawing the rebels. In 1705, the Emperor Joseph I pressured the diet to extend the Reichskrieg to include the wars ongoing in Italy and Hungary, but the diet refused. In November 1705, the electors minus Cologne and Bavaria voted to outlaw those two and the emperor transmitted the declaration of the imperial ban to the diet. =1734= During the War of the Polish Succession, which began in 1733, most of the empire supported the claim of the Saxon elector, Augustus III, to the Polish throne, against the claims of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who was supported by the French. War between France and Austria broke out in the Rhineland and in Italy. On 9 November 1733, the Frankfurt Association, an association of Imperial Circles, authorised the mobilization of a triple quota for the Austrian war effort. Finally, on 9 April 1734, the Imperial Diet declared war against France. Ultimately, while 36,338 troops were raised for the Reichsarmee by September 1735, various states provided 54,302 troops to the Austrian army through simple bilateral agreements alone. In 1735, Russia intervened on the side of the empire. A preliminary peace was signed in Vienna on 3 October that year, but the final peace treaty was not signed until 1738. =1793= After the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, Emperor Francis II petitioned the Imperial Diet for 100 Roman months on 1 September 1792. In November, the Imperial Diet agreed to a triple quota and thirty Roman months (that is, four million gulden) to be paid into the Imperial Operations Fund. Finally, on 23 March 1793, the Imperial Diet declared an imperial war against revolutionary France. Under Austrian and Prussian pressure, the stated goal of this Reichskrieg was to secure from France compensation for those imperial estates, such as Austria and Prussia, that had been fighting since April 1792. The implication was that such compensation would come in the form of territorial cessions. The Reichskrieg of 1793, unlike all those before, was thus an offensive war, although the diet itself refused to recognised this, preferring to see it as a war forced upon it by France. Throughout 1793, as Prussia's commitment to the war weakened, the increasingly defensive Reichskrieg rose in popularity. In January 1794, with the war going badly for the Empire, discussions were held behind the scenes to try to strengthen the emperor's war-making powers, but no agreement could be reached and in the end no proposal was tabled in the Imperial Diet. =1799= In late February 1799, Austria having failed to satisfy a French ultimatum, France resumed the war with the Empire by invading the Rhineland while the Congress of Rastatt was still sitting and before a peace treaty had been signed. The emperor decreed that the Reichskrieg was resumed. On 16 September, the Diet voted 100 Roman months and a quintuple quota (quintuplum), the largest military outlay in the history of the empire. This was little more than a paper decision, since many states had declared neutrality and voted against the resumption of the Reichskrieg. Since no peace treaty had been signed, it had also been unnecessary to vote on a formal declaration of war, the emperor's declaration on resuming hostilities was sufficient. Reichsexekutionskriege =Against Sweden (1675)= In response to the Swedish invasion of Brandenburg in support of France in 1674, a Reichsexekution was launched against Sweden, whose king owned the imperial duchies of Bremen and Verden, on 17 July 1675. The historian Peter Wilson denies that the war against Sweden qualifies as a true Reichskrieg for the same reasons the contemporaneous war against France does not. Writing in the 18th century, however, the constitutional scholar Johann Jakob Moser regarded it as a Reichskrieg. =Against Prussia (1757)= During the First Silesian War (1740‚Äì42), the Emperor Charles VII sought a declaration of Reichskrieg against Austria, although the latter had not breached imperial law and there was therefore no justification. The pro-Austrian elector of Mainz, Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, tabled a formal protest in the Imperial Diet on 23 September 1743 alleging that the election of Charles VII had been irregular. In such a situation, there was no chance of the diet agreeing to the emperor's proposal for a Reichskrieg against Austria. The Second Silesian War (1744‚Äì45) thus also went by without any imperial action. The Third Silesian War (1756‚Äì63), however, became wrapped in a global war of great power politics, the Seven Years' War, and Prussia could not avoid an imperial response. On 13 September 1756, the Emperor Francis I issued an advocate's mandate (mandata avocatoria) releasing imperial subjects from their oaths to the king of Prussia, Frederick II, and ordering them not to assist him in his illegal war. On 14 September, Francis requested the Imperial Diet sanction a Reichsexekution to restore peace to the empire. This was debated on 20 September without resolution. On 9 October, Francis increased his demands, asking for the Reichsarmee to be mobilised and for the intervention of the two guarantors of the Peace of Westphalia (France and Sweden). On 17 January 1757, a Reichskrieg was declared against Prussia. A triple quota was called up for a Reichs-Exekutions-Armee. The representatives of the Prussian king were removed from imperial institutions, imperial postal service to Prussian territory was suspended and travel into and out of it was banned, although not trade (even in war materiel, which was only classed as contraband in 1760). In February 1763, the Imperial Diet formally declared the Reichskrieg over and the Treaty of Hubertusburg restored the status quo ante bellum. The War of the Bavarian Succession that broke out between Austria and Prussia in 1778 saw barely any fighting, and was diplomatically resolved before any Reichsexekution was sought by the emperor. Legacy After the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the formation of German Confederation (Deutscher Bund) in 1815, a war involving several German states or countries against other parties were referred to as a Bundesfeldzug, that is, a \\"federal campaign\\". Examples include the First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì51) and the Austro-Prussian War (1866).

She was co-national All-Around champion alongside Vanessa Atler in 1997. She retired from competition the following year.  Early life  Powell was born in Stuart, Florida. Powell was raised by her mother along with four older brothers. She began practicing gymnastics at age 5. Her brother Rusty taught her how to do flips, which she picked up quickly. The family relocated to Houston, Texas when gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi invited nine-year old Powell to train under his tutelage. That same year, Powell portrayed young Nadia Comaneci in a TV Movie about the Olympic Gymnasts' life. When Powell switched gyms two years later, the family again relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Competitive gymnast  Powell made her competitive debut in 1991 at the junior national championships where she placed 9th. Powell's first international competition was in 1993, when she competed in a dual meet against Japan where she earned three silver medals. In 1995, Powell was named the U.S. team for the McDonald's American Cup following the injury of a team member. Powell won the all-around title, vault, and uneven bars at the competition. That same year Powell was part of the U.S. team that won gold at the Pan American Games. Powell's success in 1995 was followed by injuries, including lateral collateral ligament in her knee and extreme pain in her shins. Powell competed in 1996, hoping to make the Olympic Team. She finished 7th U.S. championships and 13th in the Olympic trials but was not chosen for the team. Powell then suffered more physical injuries including a pulled back muscle and another knee injury. In January 1997 Powell relocated to the Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy where Mary Lee Tracy became her new coach. Powell moved to Cincinnati while her family stayed behind in Colorado Springs. Powell took a four-week break from her training for surgery on her calf muscle. Powell became co-United States national all-around champion with Vanessa Atler in 1997. At the same event, Powell also won gold on the uneven bars. The win allowed Powell to be named to the U.S. team for the World Championship, qualified her for support funding from the national team, and earned her a spot touring with the Magnificent Seven, the U.S. gymnasts who won the 1996 Olympic team competition. At 1997 World Championships, Powell was part of the U.S. team, placing last in the team competition. At the same event, she placed 23rd in the individual all-around. Powell retired from competitive gymnastics in 1998. Years of injuries made competition too physically painful.  Cirque du Soleil  Powell joined Cirque du Soleil as an aerialist in 2003. Powell performed in La Nouba as the first American trapeze artist in the show.

This early work was multi-media using materials such as embroidery and printmaking which Almog utilized to explore feminist and gender issues in Iran,Dekel, Tal. \\"From first-wave to third-wave feminist art in Israel: a quantum leap.\\" Israel Studies, vol. 16, no. 1, 2011, p. 149+. General Reference Center GOLD. as well as capitalism and the aesthetics of the 1970s. Almog's early painting works were distinctly figurative with 1992 show in Tel Aviv featuring a collecting of jewelry. Her 1994 painting Men's Shirt and Suite, is an example of Almog's transition from figurative to abstract with less utilization of multi-media elements. Currently, Almog primarily works with acrylic paint on aircraft plywood. Her paintings feature various squares and rectangles that are either flat or painted with a gradient. These paintings lack any visible brushstrokes or texture. Her works are formalist and minimalist and layers rectangles in order to explore with concepts of interior and exterior spaces.Israel, Nico. \\"Diti Almog: Boesky & Callery.\\" Artforum International, vol. 35, no. 2, 1996, p. 118.

Often, Almog will divide her canvas into distinct sections, such as with September late afternoon with back room (2011), where the image on the left and right thematically connect but it is unknown whether they exist in the same plane of reality.

In exhibitions, works 4 by 8 inches in size have been hung next to larger works 14 by 21 inches in size. Almog often paints smaller works hanging them directly next to each other, this can appear to make it a larger canvas, September Afternoon (2011) and Sea and Sky (2011) are one example of this. Repetition is also a large feature between her works. A replica of her painting ACA is painted on her work AC along with other black squares, this same interplay can be seen within September Afternoon (2011) and Sea and Sky (2011) where the same two blue gradients are featured in the same pattern within the two separate works. = Titling = A notable feature of Almog's work is her way of titling her artwork. Almog's early artwork has more descriptive names such as Men's Shirt and Suite (1994). However, her titles in the mid-1990s are distinctly different named through various capital letters.

News of the fraud became widely known in late 2016 after various regulatory bodies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), fined the company a combined US$185 million as a result of the illegal activity. The company faces additional civil and criminal suits reaching an estimated $2.7 billion by the end of 2018. Wells Fargo clients began to notice the fraud after being charged unanticipated fees and receiving unexpected credit or debit cards or lines of credit. Initial reports blamed individual Wells Fargo branch workers and managers for the problem, as well as sales incentives associated with selling multiple \\"solutions\\" or financial products. This blame was later shifted to a top-down pressure from higher-level management to open as many accounts as possible through cross-selling. The bank took relatively few risks in the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, which led to an image of stability on Wall Street and in the financial world. The bank's stable reputation was tarnished by the widespread fraud, the subsequent coverage, and the revelation of other fraudulent practices employed by the company. The controversy resulted in the resignation of CEO John Stumpf, an investigation into the bank led by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a number of settlements between Wells Fargo and various parties, and pledges from new management to reform the bank. Background =Cross-selling= Cross-selling, the practice underpinning the fraud, is the concept of attempting to sell multiple products to consumers. For instance, a consumer with a checking account might be encouraged to take out a mortgage, or set up credit card or online banking account. Success by retail banks was measured in part by the average number of products held by a customer, and Wells Fargo was long considered the most successful cross-seller. Richard Kovacevich, the former CEO of Norwest Corporation and, later, Wells Fargo, allegedly invented the strategy while at Norwest. In a 1998 interview, Kovacevich likened mortgages, checking and savings accounts, and credit cards offered by the company to more typical consumer products, and revealed that he considered branch employees to be \\"salespeople\\", and consumers to be \\"customers\\" rather than \\"clients\\". Under Kovacevich, Norwest encouraged branch employees to sell at least eight products, in an initiative known as \\"Going for Gr-Eight\\". =Early coverage= Wells Fargo's sales culture and cross-selling strategy, and their impact on customers, were documented by the Wall Street Journal as early as 2011. In 2013, a Los Angeles Times investigation revealed intense pressure on bank managers and individual bankers to produce sales against extremely aggressive and even mathematically impossible quotas. In the Los Angeles Times article, CFO Timothy Sloan was quoted stating he was unaware of any \\"...overbearing sales culture.\\" Sloan would later replace John Stumpf as CEO. Employees opened accounts without customer consent. In an article from the American Bankruptcy Institute Journal, Wells Fargo employees reportedly \\"opened as many as 1.5 million checking and savings accounts, and more than 500,000 credit cards, without customers' authorization.\\"Rules amendments effective in December; Wells Fargo under fire for sales practices.

Cross-selling products is not a new practice, but if employees feel pushed to sell more than is needed, and are incentivized to do so, there is no surprise that unethical practices began. In 2010, New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. These policies monitor incentive-based compensation structures, and requires that banks appropriately balance risk and rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and that they are supported by effective corporate governance.Biben, M. L., Kini, S. M., Luigs, D. A., Lyons, G. J., & Alspector, L. (2016). Banking regulators focus on sales practices. Banking & Financial Services Policy Report, 35(11), 15‚Äì17. =Fraud= Employees were encouraged to order credit cards for pre-approved customers without their consent, and to use their own contact information when filling out requests to prevent customers from discovering the fraud. Employees also created fraudulent checking and savings accounts, a process that sometimes involved the movement of money out of legitimate accounts. The creation of these additional products was made possible in part through a process known as \\"pinning\\". By setting the client's PIN to \\"0000\\", bankers were able to control client accounts and were able to enroll them in programs such as online banking. Measures taken by employees to satisfy quotas included the enrollment of the homeless in fee- accruing financial products. Reports of unreachable goals and inappropriate conduct by employees to supervisors did not result in changes to expectations. After the Los Angeles Times article, the bank made nominal efforts to reform the company's sales culture. Despite alleged reforms, the bank was fined $185 million in early September 2016 due to the creation of some 1,534,280 unauthorized deposit accounts and 565,433 credit-card accounts between 2011 and 2016. Later estimates, released in May 2017, placed the number of fraudulent accounts at closer to a total of 3,500,000. In December 2016, it was revealed that employees of the bank also issued unwanted insurance policies. These included life insurance policies by Prudential Financial and renters' insurance policies by Assurant. Three whistle-blowers, Prudential employees, brought the fraud to light. Prudential later fired these employees, and announced that it might seek damages from Wells Fargo. =Initial fines and broader coverage= John Stumpf, former CEO of Wells Fargo Despite the earlier coverage in the Los Angeles Times, the controversy achieved national attention only in September 2016, with the announcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the bank would be fined $185 million for the illegal activity. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received $100 million, the Los Angeles City Attorney received $50 million, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency received the last $35 million. The fines received substantial media coverage in the following days, and triggered attention from further interested parties.Levine, Wells Fargo Opened a Couple Million Fake Accounts =Initial response from Wells Fargo and management= After news of the fines broke, the bank placed ads in newspapers taking responsibility for the controversy. However, the bank rejected the notion that its sales culture led to the actions of employees, stating \\"...[the fraud] was not part of an intentional strategy\\". Stumpf also expressed that he would be willing to accept some personal blame for the problems. Company executives and spokespeople referred to the problem as an issue with sales practices, rather than the company's broader culture. Effects =On Wells Fargo management= The bank fired approximately 5300 employees between 2011 and 2016 as a result of fraudulent sales, and discontinued sales quotas at its individual branches after the announcement of the fine in September 2016. John Shrewsberry, the bank's CFO, said the bank had invested $50 million to improve oversight in individual branches. Stumpf accepted responsibility for the problems, but in September 2016, when the story broke, indicated he had no plans to resign. Stumpf was subject to a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on September 21, 2016, in an effort led by Senator Elizabeth Warren. Before the hearing, Stumpf agreed to forgo $41 million in stock options that had not yet vested after being urged to do so by the company's board. Stumpf resigned on October 12, roughly a month after the fines by the CFPB were announced, to be replaced by COO Timothy Sloan. Sloan indicated there had not been internal pressure for Stumpf's resignation, and that he had chosen to do so after \\"...deciding that the best thing for Wells Fargo to move forward was for him to retire...\\". In November 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency levied further penalties against the bank, removing provisions from the September settlement. As a result of the OCC adding new restrictions, the bank received oversight similar to that used for troubled or insolvent financial institutions. Stumpf received criticism for praising former head of retail banking, Carrie Tolstedt, upon her retirement earlier in 2016, given that the bank had been conducting an investigation into retail banking practices for several years at the time. In April 2017, the bank utilized a clawback provision in Stumpf's contract to take back $28 million of his earnings. Tolstedt was also forced to forfeit earnings, though she denied involvement. Tolstedt was responsible for the pressure placed on middle management to dramatically increase the bank's \\"cross-sell ratio\\", a metric for how many accounts each customer had. The bank experienced decreased profitability in the first quarter after the news of the scandal broke. Payments to law firms and other external advisers resulted in increased expenses. After earnings were reported in January 2017, the bank announced it would close over 400 of its approximately 6000 branches by the end of 2018. In May 2017, the bank announced that they would cut costs through investment in technology while decreasing reliance on its ‚Äúsales organization‚Äù. The bank also revised up its 2017 efficiency-ratio goal from 60 to 61. Tim Sloan later resigned in March 2019 under pressure related to the scandal.Washington Post- After years of apologies for customer abuses, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan suddenly steps down-March 2019 =Wells Fargo costs= The CFPB fined Wells Fargo $100 million in September 8, 2016 for the \\"widespread illegal practice of secretly opening unauthorized accounts.\\" The order also required Wells Fargo to pay an estimated $2.5 million in refunds to customers and hire an independent consultant to review its procedures.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Fines Wells Fargo $100 Million for Widespread Illegal Practice of Secretly Opening Unauthorized Accounts-September 8, 2016 Wells Fargo incurred additional costs due to refunds and lawsuits: *$6.1 million in customer refunds due to inappropriate fees and charges; *$142 million in customer compensation due to a class-action settlement;Senate Banking Committee- Statement of Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo & Co.-October 3, 2017 *$480 million settlement for a shareholder class-action lawsuit;LA Times-Judge signs off on $480-million settlement with Wells Fargo shareholders-December 19, 2018 and *$575 million 50-state Attorneys General (AG) settlement for a combination of opening unauthorized accounts and charging for unnecessary auto insurance and mortgage fees.Attorney General Shapiro Announces $575 Million 50-State Settlement with Wells Fargo Bank for Opening Unauthorized Accounts and Charging Consumers for Unnecessary Auto Insurance, Mortgage Fees-December 28, 2018 The December 2018 AG settlement announcement indicated that Wells Fargo had already paid $2.3 billion in settlements and consent orders, so its $575 million settlement brought the total to nearly $3 billion. =On consumers= Approximately 85,000 of the accounts opened incurred fees, totaling $2 million. Customers' credit scores were also likely hurt by the fake accounts. The bank was able to prevent customers from pursuing legal action as the opening of an account mandated customers enter into private arbitration with the bank. The bank agreed to settle for $142 million with consumers who had accounts opened in their names without permission in March 2017. The money repaid fraudulent fees and paid damages to those affected. =On non- management Wells Fargo employees= Wells Fargo employees described intense pressure, with expectations of sales as high as 20 products a day. Others described frequent crying, levels of stress that led to vomiting, and severe panic attacks. At least one employee consumed hand sanitizer to cope with the pressure. Some indicated that calls to the company's ethics hotline were met with either no reaction or resulted in the termination of the employee making the call. During the period of the fraud, some Wells Fargo branch-level bankers encountered difficulty gaining employment at other banks. Banks issue U5 documents to departing employees, a record of any misbehavior or unethical conduct. Wells Fargo issued defamatory U5 documents to bankers who reported branch-level malfeasance, indicating that they had been complicit in the creation of unwanted accounts, a practice that received media attention as early as 2011. There is no regulatory process to appeal a defamatory U5, other than to file a lawsuit against the issuing corporation. Wells Fargo created a special internal group to rehire employees who had left the bank but were not implicated in the scandal. In April 2017, Timothy Sloan stated that the bank would rehire some 1000 employees who had either been wrongfully terminated or who had quit in protest of fraud. Sloan emphasized that those being rehired would not be those who had participated in the creation of fake accounts. The announcement was made shortly after the news was released that the bank had clawed back income from both Carrie Tolstedt and John Stumpf. Later government investigations and fines =First hearing= John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on September 20, 2016. Stumpf delivered prepared testimony and was then questioned. Senators, including Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, asked about whether the bank would clawback income from executives and how the bank would help consumers it harmed. Stumpf gave prepared testimony, but deferred from answering some of the questions, citing lack of expertise concerning the legal ramifications of the fraud. Elizabeth Warren referred to Stumpf's leadership as \\"gutless\\" and told him he should resign. Patrick Toomey expressed doubt that the 5300 employees fired by Wells Fargo had acted independently and without orders from supervisors or management. Stumpf was later replaced as CEO by Tim Sloan, and Warren has expressed apprehension about leadership so closely associated with the period during which the fraud occurred. In October 2018, Warren urged the Fed Chairman to restrict any additional growth by Wells Fargo until Sloan is replaced as CEO. =Other investigations= Prosecutors including Preet Bharara in New York City, and others in San Francisco and North Carolina, opened their own investigations into the fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened its own investigation into the bank in November 2016. Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, announced her intention to investigate the bank further in early 2019. She previously released a report about the bank's malpractice, and had called for the government to dismantle the bank. Former Wells Fargo Chairwoman Elizabeth ‚ÄúBetsy‚Äù Duke and James Quigley resigned on March 9, 2020 three days before House Committee on Financial Services hearings on the fraud scandal.Wells Fargo directors resign under pressure from House Democrats BY SYLVAN LANE, The Hill, 9 March 2020 The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission reached a settlement with the bank in February 2020 for a total fine of to address the bank's criminal and civil violations. However, this settlement does not cover any future litigation against any individual employee of the bank. Reactions =Divestitures by major clients= In September 2016, California suspended its relationship with the bank. John Chiang, the California State Treasurer, immediately removed the bank as bookrunner on two municipal bond issuings, suspended investments in Wells Fargo, and removed the bank as the state's broker dealer. Chiang cited the company's disregard for the well-being of Californians as the reason for the decision, and indicated the suspension would last for a year. Chiang later extended these sanctions against the bank to last for a second year, citing the \\"... opaque manner with which the bank continues to do business and the frequency of new disclosures of wanton greed and lack of institutional control\\" as his reasons for doing so. The city of Chicago also divested $25 million invested with Wells Fargo in the same month as the actions taken by the state of California. Additionally, Chicago alderman Edward M. Burke introduced a measure barring the city from doing business with the bank for two years. Other cities and municipalities that have either replaced or sought to replace Wells Fargo include Philadelphia, which uses the bank to process payroll, and the state of Illinois. Seattle also ended its relationship with the bank in an effort led by Kshama Sawant. In addition to the account controversy, Seattle cited the company's support of the Dakota Access Pipeline as a reason to end its relationship. =Lawsuit by Navajo Nation= The Navajo Nation sued Wells Fargo in December 2017. The lawsuit claims Wells Fargo employees told elderly members of the Navajo nation who did not speak English that checks could only be cashed if they had Wells Fargo savings accounts. Wells Fargo was the only bank that operated on a national scale with operations with the Navajo Nation. Wells Fargo settled with the Navajo Nation for $6.5 million in August 2019. =From the media= Wells Fargo survived the Great Recession more or less unharmed, even acquiring and rescuing a failing bank, Wachovia. Politicians on both the left and the right, including Elizabeth Warren and Jeb Hensarling have called for investigation beyond that done by the CFPB. Many reacted with surprise both to Stumpf's initial unwillingness to resign and the bank's blaming the problem on lower-level employees. In a fall 2019 article, management professor William Tayler and doctoral student Michael Harris analyzed the scandal as an example of the surrogation phenomenon. Legacy at Wells Fargo =Workplace culture= As of early 2019, employees at the bank indicated goals remained unrealistic. =Rebranding= On May 6, 2018, Wells Fargo launched an integrated marketing campaign called \\"Re-Established\\" to emphasize the company's commitment to re- establishing trust with existing and potential customers. The television commercial opens with the bank's origins in the Old West, references the scandal and fast-forwards to depict bank employees and customers. Roughly a year later, in January 2019, the company announced another overhaul of their image, in a campaign called \\"This is Wells Fargo\\". Contemporaneous allegations In April 2018, new allegations against Wells Fargo were reported, including signing unwitting customers up for unnecessary auto insurance policies, with the possibility of an additional $1 billion fine.Emily Flitter and Glenn Thrush, Wells Fargo Said to Be Target of $1 Billion U.S. Fine, The New York Times, April 19, 2018 The company later paid this fine. The bank has also faced an investigation into the sales practices employed by the company's financial advisors.

Visscher is best known for hard edge abstraction and minimalism within her scientific approach and exploration of perception and mathematics.  Early life and education  Jantje Visscher obtained her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. She then later earned her M.F.A in Fine Arts, Painting and Printmaking from the University of California Berkeley in 1962. After grad school, Visscher returned to Minnesota to take care of her family. It wasn't until 1973 when Visscher joined the WARM collective in MN, an environment and support that Visscher deeply connected with.  Groups and collectives  = WARM (Women's Art Resource of MN) = Visscher is one of the founding members of WARM, a feminist artist collective based in MN. The collective became an important aspect that shaped and reinforced Visscher as an artist. She now serves as a mentor in the WARM Mentor program of which pairs emerging artists with professional artists. Her philosophy as a mentor includes the practice of constant revision of goals and refocusing within daily life and as an artist. She strives to help protegees develop basic career skills like marketing, drawing, and Photoshop that will help them become successful practicing artists. As a mentor, Visscher also help protegees develop their art through philosophical discussion, learning technical skills, creating art on a regular basis and many more. Visscher is a mixed media artist and has been a part of the WARM Mentor Program in 2015-2016, mentoring artist Kate Vinson, and also in 2013-2014, mentoring artist Maryellen Murphy. Visscher has taken part in both final capstone exhibitions for the WARM Mentor Program, accompanied by her fellow protegees. She exhibited her piece, Capital in the final exhibition Landing and Launching in 2016 and exhibited Making Your Wings in the 2014 final exhibition Beyond the Surface. = Traffic Zone Center for Visual Art = Visscher is also one of the founding members of Traffic Zone Center for Visual Arts of which provides high quality and affordable studio spaces for artists.

Career  = Style = Visscher is fascinated with using various techniques and processes to achieve nonobjective representation. Her style emerged as using geometric principles to create intuitive expression through repetition, limited color palettes and grids. Visscher introduces a shifting relationship between figure and ground as her experimental constructions invites various perceptions and illusions from her viewers. Visscher's work is reminiscent of the natural sciences and architecture. She uses radiating lines to intersect grids, mimicking moire patterns to create dramatic weaving, swirling and swelling forms. In Beautiful Lie Landscapes, it features diptych photographs of natural landscapes and waves that create an optical illusion when disoriented. Visscher ‚Äúnever gave the subject a thought until she glanced at a photo of a wave a couple of years ago and realized it was upside down but looked right‚Äù hence the beginning of her curiosity with orientation and perception.

It had a large area aerofoil on each of its single wing bracing struts which could be rotated together or independently to give lift or drag. Design Magni Vittoria Model A photo from Les Ailes September 2, 1926 Magni Vittoria Model E photo from Les Ailes September 2, 1926 One contemporary report described the Magni Vittoria as a sesquiplane, although it is more correctly called a lifting strut. It evolved, by progressive reduction of the lifting strut, into a conventionally braced parasol wing monoplane. The strut was mounted at a single point on the lower fuselage and a second on the upper wing leading edge at about 70% of the span and could be rotated about this axis to act as an auxiliary lift surface at low angles of incidence or as an air brake at high angles. Magni had begun to study this idea as early as 1919, when he displayed a scale model of an aircraft, designed around a Gnome rotary engine, which was displayed at the first post-war Paris Salon. He also tested models in the Eiffel wind-tunnel. The Vittoria 1924 was his first full-scale aircraft. Its thin wing was unswept and had constant chord out to quadrantal tips. There was a deep and wide curved cutout over the cockpit to increase the pilot's field of upward view and broad-chord, long ailerons. The entirely wooden wing was in two parts, each with five spars, ten ribs and plywood covering. The forward four spars were curved near the tip, converging on the aft spar. The wings were mounted low over the fuselage on a short, steel frame cabane and braced by the axes of the lower wings. Each lower wing, also wooden, had a single box spar as its axis with ribs and a strip around the leading edge and its lower rounded end. This end was pivoted to a triangular, transverse steel frame within the fuselage which also carried the cabane at its upper vertex. The ply-covered wing was straight-tapered to a squared-off upper end, where it pivoted in a short, inward-angled mounting with a broadly faired foot on the upper wing underside. The angle of incidence of each lower wing was adjustable between -3¬∞ and 90¬∞ with a lever at the pilot's side; the wings could be moved together by moving just the lefthand lever. The Vittoria was powered by a , six cylinder Anzani 6A.20 radial engine. The metal engine frame, engine, aluminium cowling, aluminium spinner and two blade propeller could easily be detached from the fuselage behind it, a ply-covered semi-monocoque with wooden hoops, frames and longerons. The large, open cockpit was under the wing cutout, with an effective Triplex windscreen and a prominent, faired headrest which also enclosed a parachute. The tail surfaces of the Vittoria were constructed, like the wings, with ply covering. The horizontal surfaces were mounted at mid-fuselage, though the tailplane was vestigial, more like a long fillet which carried large, balanced elevators with curved leading edges. The fin was broad and noticeably upswept, bearing a very broad, rounded rudder. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, with a pair of faired-in, wood and ply inverted L-struts on either side carrying a rubber cord sprung steel single axle, fitted with large diameter wheels. The steel-shod tailskid was mounted on a laminated ash spring. Development The Vittoria was flown for the first time on 22 October 1924. A second example, designated model Vittoria 1925-A, was nearing completion in September 1925, differing from the 1924 model \\"in details only.\\" A year later, Magni had systematically investigated a series of six variations based on it, designated in pairs by letters A and B, C and D and E and F. The upper wing was unchanged throughout but the area of the lower wings was reduced between successive pairs; types E and F had only streamlined, rotatable bracing struts. The first member of each pair had larger ailerons than the second. Though some performance figures for the A configuration had been released, little had been said about the original objective of reducing landing speeds. Magni continued to experiment with rotating bracing struts to the start of World War II. The Magni Vale of 1935 had a faired V-strut bracing the wing on each side. The leading members of these were fixed but the rear ones could be rotated as airbrakes as they could on the Vittoria.

He was mayor of Thebes. His wife was a woman called Tity. So far, Paser is only known from the decorated blocks of his funerary chapel. The remains of the funerary chapel were found west of Medinet Habu, that is the modern name of the mortuary temple of Ramses III. There were built several mud brick chapels once paved on the inside with decorated stone slabs. These chapels belonged to highest officials who had the honor to have a funerary chapel close to the one of the king. However, early on the chapels were destroyed and the blocks were used for other building projects.

The story was published for the first time in 1920 in Haagse Post and later in Proza.  Story  A young Dutch-Indian journalist who is on vacation in Dresden decides to visit the Semperoper to see a performance of Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. He gets a seat in the fourth range, in the most upper part of the auditorium. On the day of the performance, he buys himself an opera glass to see the play better. During the performance, he feels an almost irresistible urge to throw the opera glass to the head of a bald man sitting in the gallery right below him. Frightened by his own thought, he leaves the opera glass in the building after the play. Five years later, the same man is back again in Dresden and decides one more time to go to a performance of Die Walk√ºre. The performance is again in the Semperoper, and he gets exactly the same seat as before. To his dismay, an usherette gives him the opera glass which he had left behind in the building the previous time. A few moments after the play has started, he throws the opera glass right against the head of a spectator who is sitting next to the married couple right below him. The spectator who is hit cries out loudly and then dies.  External links  * 'De binocle', Jan Fontijn, Leven in extase.

Course  Eberhard I supported the Bohemian estates and the Bohemian king, Henry of Carinthia in their conflict against Emperor Albert I of Habsburg and his successor, Henry VII. In 1309, charges were brought against Eberhard because of the grasping, self-serving way he discharged his duties as Landvogt, and he was therefore summoned by Henry VII to a Hoftag at Speyer. Eberhard left Speyer prematurely, whereupon Henry imposed the Imperial Ban on him. Henry now supported the Swabian imperial cities in their confrontation with Count Eberhard of W√ºrttemberg, who had also operated an aggressive territorial policy against the cities. Because Henry was going to Italy, he appointed the new Reichslandvogt, Conrad IV of Weinsberg, as the army commander of the Swabian imperial cities and several nobles. The principal Swabian cities involved were Esslingen am Neckar and Reutlingen; the nobles included von T√ºbingen, von Vaihingen and Herter of Dusslingen. In spring 1311 the Reichskrieg began, the first military action presumably being the siege of enemy's family castle, Wirtemberg, which took place at the beginning of May. After a failed relief attempt on 26 May, the castle was captured on 13 July. After the Hohenasperg Castle fell in August 1312, Eberhard, now a fugitive, was received by his Baden brother-in-law, Margrave Rudolf Hesso in one of the two bergfrieds of Besigheim. Only the death of Henry VII on 24 August 1313, and the political situation after the king's election in 1314, when Louis IV was crowned king and Frederick the Fair was declared as counter-king, prevented W√ºrttemberg's defeat. Eberhard then cleverly manoeuvered between king and counter-king, so that he was not only able to compensate himself for his territorial losses but also gain additional territories. The Reichsheer captured or destroyed inter alia the following castles: Wirtemberg, Hohenasperg, Hohenjungingen, Ror, Old Lichtenstein, Haideck, Hochbiedeck, Greifenstein, Untergreifenstein,Hartmann Schedel: Weltchronik.

In other words, Beltrami flow is a flow where Lamb vector is zero. It is named after the Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami due to his derivation of the Beltrami vector field, while initial developments in fluid dynamics were done by the Russian scientist Ippolit S. Gromeka in 1881.Gromeka, I. \\"Some cases of incompressible fluid motion.\\" Scientific notes of the Kazan University (1881): 76‚Äì148.Truesdell, Clifford. The kinematics of vorticity. Vol. 954. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1954. Description Since the vorticity vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} and the velocity vector \\\\mathbf{v} are parallel to each other, we can write :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v}=0, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = \\\\alpha(\\\\mathbf{x},t) \\\\mathbf{v}, where \\\\alpha(\\\\mathbf{x},t) is some scalar function. One immediate consequence of Beltrami flow is that it can never be a planar or axisymmetric flow because in those flows, vorticity is always perpendicular to the velocity field. The other important consequence will be realized by looking at the incompressible vorticity equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} - (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{v}= u abla^2\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} + abla\\\\times f, where \\\\mathbf{f} is an external body forces such as gravitational field, electric field etc., and u is the kinematic viscosity. Since \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} and \\\\mathbf{v} are parallel, the non-linear terms in the above equation are identically zero (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} =(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{v}=0. Thus Beltrami flows satisfies the linear equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}}{\\\\partial t} = u abla^2\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} + abla\\\\times f. When \\\\mathbf{f}=0, the components of vorticity satisfies a simple heat equation. Trkalian flow Viktor Trkal considered the Beltrami flows without any external forces in 1919Trkal, V. \\"A remark on the hydrodynamics of viscous fluids.\\" Cas. Pst.

Generalized Beltrami flow The generalized Beltrami flow satisfies the conditionDrazin, Philip G., and Norman Riley. The Navier‚ÄìStokes equations: a classification of flows and exact solutions.

Cambridge University Press, 2006. : abla\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})=0 which is less restrictive than the Beltrami condition \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}=0. Unlike the normal Beltrami flows, the generalized Beltrami flow can be studied for planar and axisymmetric flows. =Steady planar flows= For steady generalized Beltrami flow, we have abla^2\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}=0,\\\\ abla\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})=0 and since it is also planar we have \\\\mathbf{v}=(u,v,0),\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}=(0,0,\\\\zeta). Introduce the stream function :u = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial y}, \\\\quad v = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x}, \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad abla^2\\\\psi = - \\\\zeta. Integration of abla\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})=0 gives \\\\zeta=-f(\\\\psi). So, complete solution is possible if it satisfies all the following three equations : abla^2\\\\psi = -\\\\zeta, \\\\quad abla^2\\\\zeta =0, \\\\quad \\\\zeta = -f(\\\\psi). A special case is considered when the flow field has uniform vorticity f(\\\\psi)=C=\\\\text{constant}. Wang (1991)Wang, C. Y. 1991 Exact solutions of the steady-state Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 23, 159‚Äì177. gave the generalized solution as :\\\\zeta = \\\\psi + A(x,y), \\\\quad A(x,y) = ax + by assuming a linear function for A(x,y). Substituting this into the vorticity equation and introducing the separation of variables \\\\psi(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) with the separating constant \\\\lambda^2 results in :\\\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\\\frac{b}{ u} \\\\frac{dX}{dx} - \\\\lambda^2 X =0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} - \\\\frac{a}{ u} \\\\frac{dY}{dy} + \\\\lambda^2 Y =0. The solution obtained for different choices of a,\\\\ b,\\\\ \\\\lambda can be interpreted differently, for example, a=0, \\\\ b = -U, \\\\lambda^2>0 represents a flow downstream a uniform grid, a=-U, \\\\ b = 0, \\\\lambda^2=0 represents a flow created by a stretching plate, a=-U, \\\\ b = U, \\\\lambda^2=0 represents a flow into a corner, a=-V, \\\\ b = -U, \\\\lambda^2=0 represents an Asymptotic suction profile etc. =Unsteady planar flows= Here, : abla^2\\\\psi = -\\\\zeta,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\zeta}{\\\\partial t} = abla^2\\\\zeta,\\\\quad \\\\zeta = - f(\\\\psi, t) .

On the decay of vortices in a viscous fluid.\\" The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science 46.274 (1923): 671‚Äì674. He showed that the separation \\\\psi = e^{-K u t} \\\\Psi(x,y) satisfies the equation and also : abla^2 \\\\Psi = - K\\\\Psi. Taylor also considered an example, a decaying system of eddies rotating alternatively in opposite directions and arranged in a rectangular array :\\\\Psi = A \\\\cos \\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{d}\\\\cos \\\\frac{\\\\pi y}{d} which satisfies the above equation with K = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi^2}{d^2}, where d is the length of the square formed by an eddy.

Integration of abla\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}) = 0 gives \\\\zeta = rf(\\\\psi) and the three equations are :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z^2} = -\\\\zeta, \\\\quad abla^2\\\\zeta = 0, \\\\quad \\\\zeta = rf(\\\\psi) The first equation is the Hicks equation.

Overview The OIF published the FlexE Interoperability Agreement (IA) in 2016. FlexE enables equipment to support new Ethernet connection types. FlexE allows data center providers to utilize optical transport network bandwidth in more flexible ways. Top level features FlexE supports the bonding of multiple links, which supports creating larger links out of multiple slower links in a more efficient way than the traditional link aggregation. FlexE also supports the sub-rating of links, which allows an operator to only use a portion of a link. FlexE also supports the channelization of links, which allows one link to carry several lower-speed or sub-rated links from different sources. Basic properties of FlexE  =Mechanism reuse= FlexE reuses many mechanisms from Ethernet. Much of the FlexE's functionality is achieved by adding a time-division multiplexing calendar that interacts with the existing Ethernet 64b66b mechanism, allowing bandwidth to be allocated with 5 Gb/s granularity. The calendar is communicated along with the data. =Standards-defined physical lanes= FlexE is defined to make use of standards-defined physical lanes, namely the various forms of 25 Gb/s Ethernet lanes. =Efficient link aggregation= FlexE can utilize the entire aggregated link, creating an alternative to traditional Link Aggregation (LAG) solutions, which use 70-80% of a link. FlexE has deterministic performance, whereas IEEE 802.3ad-based or the later 802.1-based LAG does not. =Low added latency= FlexE has low added latency as compared to regular Ethernet. The multiplexing is accomplished using time division multiplexing instead of packet buffers. This type of multiplexing delivers deterministic latency that is near the minimum needed to deliver the bandwidth Optical Transport Network properties of FlexE  =Compatible with transport= FlexE is backwards compatible with the existing optical transport network (OTN) infrastructure. A FlexE compatible interface can be connected to a piece of transport gear that is not aware of FlexE. When using it in this manner, FlexE traffic appears to the transport gear as if it was ordinary Ethernet traffic. =Main transport features= FlexE has a set of features to support its use in transport networks. An example of this is that FlexE supports two copies of the calendar, which can be switched between. Another example is a link overhead messaging channel. =Optional transport features= The optional use of FlexE-aware OTN equipment provides additional functionality such as matching client and line rates. A scenario where this can be of use is when the transport equipment equipped with coherent links delivers a flexible amount of bandwidth to a channel based on reach differences or other factors. This bandwidth can be used more precisely by having the FlexE-aware MAC produce the right amount of traffic at the source. FlexE 2.0 On December 7, 2016, the OIF announced the start of a FlexE 2.0 project. FlexE 2.0 adds management detail, provides a way to scale the calendar slot bandwidth, adds a skew management option, and supports the transport of time or frequency. OIF development The OIF task group that developed FlexE has active liaison relationships with the IEEE 802.3 working group and the International Telecommunication Union study group 15. Public demonstrations A FlexE compliant implementation was demonstrated in the OIF booth at the Optical Fiber Conference in 2017. A more elaborate demonstration was conducted together with the Ethernet Alliance at OFC in 2018.

State of Washington (short form: McCleary v. Washington), commonly known as the McCleary Decision, was a lawsuit against the State of Washington. The case alleged that the state, in the body of the state legislature, had failed to meet the state constitutional duty (in Article IX, Section 1) \\"to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders.\\" King County Superior Court Judge John Erlick sided with the Plaintiffs, stating that the State was indeed failing to adequately provide for basic education, saying \\"State funding is not ample, it is not stable, and it is not dependable.\\" Washington State Supreme Court On January 5th, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed with the opinion of the King County Superior Court that the State was not fulfilling its obligation to fully fund education in the state, with some justices dissenting in part on the question of continued judicial oversight. Subsequent Developments In the 2013 Legislative Session, the State Legislature increased school funding by 11.4% to a total of $15.2 billion. They also passed three major reform bills in an attempt to further comply with the McCleary ruling. Despite these changes, the Supreme Court did not find the State in compliance. On January 9, 2014 the Supreme Court issued an order setting a deadline of April 30, 2014 for the legislature to come up with an adequate funding plan. On August 13th, 2015, the Supreme Court ordered a $100,000 a day fine. This money was to be placed in a special account that would be used to benefit public education. The Court also urged the Governor at the time, Jay Inslee, to call a special session of the legislature to pass a funding plan to bring the State into compliance. On June 7th, 2018, the Supreme Court declared the state had fully covered the funding of basic education, lifting the contempt order and $100,000 a day fine, ending any judicial oversight of the case. On April 11th, 2019, at least one school district (Spokane Public Schools) announced significant staffing cuts tied directly to the McCleary decision. Although the decision increased state funding of school districts it also reduced funding from local levies resulting in a projected shortfall of almost $31 Million for the district in the 2019-20 school year. The net staff reduction of about 8% represented 325 paid positions, impacted either through layoff or reduction in hours.

She is considered to be a na√Øf or primitive artist.  Life  Reinbolt was born one of 16 children in a farm in Vit√≥ria da Conquista, BA, Brazil, on September 14, 1919. Her father was a farmer who planted cotton, corn, rice, and beans, amongst other things, and cared for pigs, sheep, cattle, chicken and horses. Her mother, Ana Maria de Souza Pereira, was a farmhand and a craftsman that mainly occupied herself by threading cotton, creating pottery dishes and pots, fabricating lace, and making butter. Madalena was never formally educated, and did not learn how to read, besides signing her own name. In her early 20s, Reinbold moved to Salvador to work as a maid. In 1945, she moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she spent two years working as a maid before moving to S√£o Paulo, in 1947. She moved back to Rio de Janeiro soon after, and finally settled in Petr√≥polis, in 1949, where she would work as the cook for Lota de Macedo Soares and Elizabeth Bishop at Samambaia, Soares' family estate. Reinbolt was fired from her position as cook of Samambaia in late 1952 for spending too much time painting. According to Elizabeth Bishop, \\"it finally got to be a choice between art and peace, and tranquility seemed more important than a masterpiece every afternoon.\\" After she got fired, Reinbold continued to paint, and sold some of her works to Soares' friends. In 1952, she married Luiz Augusto Reinbolt, the groundskeeper at Samambaia. Madalena Santos Reinbolt died in Petr√≥polis in 1977.  Work  Reinbolt started expressing herself creatively as a child by painting old newspapers and making collages out of leaves and feathers. Soon after, she started to draw, paint, and embroider freehand. As a maid in Salvador, she embroidered dish cloths with designs drawn by her employer. In S√£o Paulo, her employer would refer to Reinbolt as an artist and would incentivize her to pursue a career in the arts. Reinbolt's first known paintings are from the early 1950s. According to Elizabeth Bishop, Reinbolt started painting on rocks and garbage pails while Bishop and Soares were out of town, and was incentivized by Lota de Macedo Soares to continue her artistic endeavors. According to Reinbolt, Soares gave her brushes, oil paints, and paper after finding an album of drawings she made after moving away from Rio de Janeiro that depicted the city's landscapes and landmarks like Sugarloaf mountain and Christ the Redeemer. From 1950 up to 1963, Reinbolt worked with oil on paper. After that, she started working exclusively on canvas. Her paintings were made in an expressionistic or gestural style, with quick and long brushstrokes. Around 1969, Madalena Santos Reinbolt stopped painting and started making tapestries with yarn on burlap. Reinbolt referred to these large-scale, multicolored tapestries as \\"paintings with wool\\", since they continued to reflect her gestural style, with thread instead of paint. She kept multiple colored threads at hand, working with up to 154 needles at a time. Her tapestries depicted agropastoral themes similar to the ones she experienced growing up in rural Bahia, with animals, trees, and boiaderos. Reinbolt's work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale after her death. Her paintings and tapestries are currently featured in public and private collections, like the Museu Afro Brasil and the Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo Assis Chateaubriand - MASP, both in S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

It was directed by series executive producer John Cameron, and written by Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi. The title refers to one of the three classic laws of thought in classical logic known as the principle or law of noncontradiction.S.M. Cohen, \\"Aristotle on the Principle of Non- Contradiction\\", Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 3James Danaher, \\"The Laws of Thought\\", The Philosopher, Vol. LXXXXII No. 1 The episode follows policewoman Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) as she comes to Los Angeles to further investigate the mysterious past of her stepfather by researching information about his previous life as science fiction writer Thaddeus Mobley (Thomas Randall Mann). Meanwhile, the viewers also witness Mobley's story back in the 1970s, while following via animation the story of The Planet Wyh, one of his novels. It is the very first Fargo episode to feature only one main character (although Coon's fellow main cast member Ewan McGregor also voices a character in The Planet Wyh), and the first to take place outside of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada or Missouri. \\"The Law of Non-Contradiction\\" was first aired on May 3, 2017, and was seen by 1.17 million viewers. It was acclaimed by critics, with some calling it one of the best episodes in the series. Coon's performance, the writing, and the episode's originality and uniqueness within the series were all highly praised, while its various themes and self-aware lack of point were the subject of several analyses.  Plot  In 1975 Los Angeles, young and trustful science fiction writer Thaddeus Mobley receives an award for his novel The Planet Wyh and meets producer Howard Zimmerman, who wants to adapt the book into a film. During a screen test, Zimmerman introduces him to actress and femme fatale Vivian Lord. After Zimmerman claims that he is having trouble attracting Warren Beatty to the project, Mobley agrees to provide him with the necessary finances using his book advances. He begins dating Lord, who seduces him into becoming dependant on cocaine. These factors leave Mobley heavily in debt, and he discovers too late that he is a victim of Zimmerman and Lord's elaborate scam, as they never intended to make the movie. Enraged, he near-fatally beats Zimmerman. Before fleeing L.A. in fear of the consequences, Mobley sees the name of the manufacturer of his motel room's toilet, Dennis Stussy and Sons, (with the faded \\"D\\" implying that it is how he chose his future name of Ennis Stussy, Gloria Burgle's stepfather). In the present (2010), Gloria arrives in L.A. to investigate her stepfather's past. Upon her arrival, she is overwhelmed by the behavior of the locals, has her baggage stolen, and, in her room - the same one where her stepfather lived in 1975 - finds a strange box that keeps turning itself off. She tracks down Zimmerman, left crippled by Mobley's assault, and Lord, the latter telling her of the past events mentioned above. Having gathered this information, Gloria finally realizes that none of this ever had anything to do with the murder case, and that her journey was pointless. Before finally going back to Eden Valley, Minnesota, bringing the box with her, she also notices the toilet manufacturer's name. Upon her return, she is informed that fingerprints found at the murder scene belong to a parolee named Maurice LeFay, but that he died in a freak accident shortly after the murder. During the episode, Gloria reads The Planet Wyh. The novel, depicted to the audience via animation with Gloria as narrator, tells the story of Unit MNSKY, a small robot programmed to observe and record, and who only says the phrase \\"I can help!\\". After his spaceship crashed on Earth millions of years ago and his scientist companion died, MNSKY witnesses the creation of matter, the birth of life, the rise and fall of civilizations, and much more. After two million years, the first contact with extraterrestrial life takes place, and MNSKY is recovered by the Federation of United Planets. After being recognized as the oldest sentient being in the universe and thanked for the massive amounts of information he recorded, MNSKY is told that it is time to shut himself down; he complies.  Production  = Casting = The character of Vivian Lord is notable for being played by Francesca Eastwood (daughter of Clint Eastwood and Frances Fisher) as a young woman, and by Frances Fisher (wrongly spelled as \\"Francis Fisher\\" in the end credits) as an older woman. The stranger in the plane, called Paul Marrane, is played by Ray Wise. = Animation = Hawley asked Don Hertzfeldt to write and animate the Planet Wyh sequences, which at this time were intended to run a total of 23 minutes and be spread throughout the entire season, but Hertzfeldt reluctantly declined, saying he would be unable to complete this amount of work in time. The show's animation was ultimately much shorter, appearing only in \\"The Law of Non-Contradiction\\", but reviewers still noted Hertzfeldt's influence. In 2018, Hertzfeldt said that he wished they had gone in a different direction to avoid confusing or upsetting viewers who thought the sequences were his work. = Music = The music for the episode was provided by series composer Jeff Russo. Several pre-existing songs were featured in the episode: \\"Liar\\" by Three Dog Night, \\"Blue Shadows on the Trail\\" by Riders of the Sky, \\"Silver Bells\\" by Gene Autry, \\"Orisa\\" by Moncho y su Wawanko Gitano, and \\"Jingo\\" by Santana. Unlike the previous episodes of the season, the end credits, instead of a song, feature the theme of the original film by Carter Burwell, re- arranged by Russo.  Reception  =Ratings= The episode first aired in the US on FX on May 3, 2017, and was seen by 1.17 million viewers. = Critical reception = \\"The Law of Non-Contradiction\\" received critical acclaim, particularly for its uniqueness, originality, writing, themes, and Coon's performance. The guest performances, particularly Rob McElhenney's and Ray Wise's, were also praised. It currently holds a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes: the critical consensus is \\"'The Law of Non-Contradiction' impressively navigates a single storyline and a drastic change in location and tone, with compellingly unconventional results.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of the New York Observer was very enthusiastic about the episode: she applauded Coon's performance and her character's journey, as well as the \\"grandiose\\" speeches of Gloria. She also praised the choice to make an episode with little to no relation to the season's main plot, stating \\"What makes this episode brilliant isn‚Äôt what sets these three stories apart but what connects them. And they are connected, from 2010 to the cocaine-fueled 70s to a color-and-ink animated robot world [...] Fargo is playing with the idea that there is no such thing as an unimportant story, only the moments between collisions when we‚Äôre not truly living.\\" Scott Tobias of The New York Times gave a very positive review, highly praising its writing and originality, and comparing the episode's themes to those of the original film and Barton Fink, another film of the Coens. He also praised Wise's guest appearance. Ben Travers of IndieWire gave the episode an A- rating, stating \\"Just when you thought Fargo was playing it safe in Season 3, in comes a big swing. Episode 3 had a lot of originality to it, breaking the pattern set by Seasons 1 and 2 while elevating one character to telling heights. In other words, arguments that Hawley was ready to recede into formula were put to rest, and those of us already enthralled with Year Three were again reminded of Gloria‚Äôs distinct relationship to her policeman predecessors. Just as importantly, it threw an early curveball for everyone, knocking us off our game and reminding us how creative this anthology can be.\\" He also praised how the episode showed both the good and bad sides of technology. Noel Murray of Rolling Stone called the episode \\"a wondrous, moody hour of television, bordering on despairing, with only a little of the comedic quirkiness that is this drama's stock-in-trade. It's the rare prestige TV episode that might've been even better if it had run even longer\\". He highly praised the story of Unit MNSKY. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club considered \\"The Law of Non-Contradiction\\" one of the best episodes in the entire show, including previous seasons, as well as his possible personal favourite. He gave it an A rating, stating \\"It lacks the emotional power of events from previous seasons, but in its place achieves a sustained, knife‚Äôs edge sort of curiosity, a high-wire act that keeps threatening to tip over into utter meaninglessness without quite doing so\\". \\"What holds all this together, for me, is Gloria finding out where Ennis got his name. It‚Äôs like a shaggy dog story [...] Ennis‚Äôs past isn‚Äôt why he got killed, but there is a chain of events that brought him to that house in the midwest, a series of decisions that both put him into Gloria‚Äôs life and also made him the inadvertent target of someone looking for someone else. [...] It wanders, and eventually finds its way back home, but it‚Äôs maybe the closest the series has yet come to actually capturing more than just quirk and crime: that all tragedies are just farce if you step back far enough, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less tragic. Or less funny. Noting the many references to the works of the Coen brothers as usual, he however expressed concern that Fargo \\"runs the risk of becoming a series of paper dolls being slotted into new outfits without much variation at the source\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a near-perfect 9.5 rating out of 10, stating \\"Carrie Coon plus a severe change of location plus animated interludes about a wandering robot plus flashbacks to a Hollywood con gone wrong made for one of the most unconventional and rewarding Fargo episodes to date. Fargo changed its climate this week for an awesome Gloria-centric story focused on the mystery of her dead stepfather\\". Brian Tallerico of Vulture gave the episode a four out of five rating. Conversely, Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a C rating, stating \\"there was the unshakable sense that something was off ‚Äî like we‚Äôre in an invasion movie and are starting to suspect that our friend has been body-snatched. It looks like Fargo, and it sounds like Fargo. But is that really Fargo in there? [...] All of the pieces are here for a season of Fargo, but there‚Äôs no heart. The show still looks like our friend, but there‚Äôs no life in its eyes.\\" Incidentally, Coon had also received praise around the time of the episode's airing for her performance in the third season of The Leftovers, which led to comparisons being made between her performances and characters, and praise being given to her acting range. = Analysis =  Comparisons to the work of the Coens  the iconic picture from Barton Fink (left). As most episodes of Fargo, \\"The Law of Non-Contradiction\\" drew comparisons with the works of the Coen brothers, most notably in this occurrence with a sub-plot in the original film revolving around Mike Yanagita, which Fargo creator Noah Hawley had acknowledged in the past as one of the show's main influences; in the film, Marge Gunderson, while in Minneapolis, meets up with Mike, a former classmate from her hometown that she hasn't seen in a long time. There, he tells her that he married an old mutual friend of theirs who has since passed away, tearfully confesses his loneliness since her death, and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Marge is sympathetic towards Mike, but ultimately learns that everything he told her was a lie. With a new look at the human capacity to deceive, she immediately returns to question Jerry Lundegaard a second time, realizing that he may have lied to her. To Scott Tobias of The New York Times, the episode is \\"basically an hourlong Mike Yanagita scene\\", as Gloria is \\"learning about secrets and lies and then coming back to her own town with unlocked doors, bringing with her a keener sense of the possibilities.\\" Other reviewers also drew comparisons with the Yanagita subplot. Many reviewers noticed that, in addition to several of the episode's elements and themes being reminiscent of Barton Fink, Gloria's pose while she thinks on a beach is a reference to the picture Barton Fink is obsessed with in the film. It was also noticed that the previous scene, a conversation between Gloria and Vivian Lord, takes place in a diner featured in The Big Lebowski. Parallels were also drawn between the episode and the films The Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn‚Äôt There.  The Planet Wyh and the box  Vinnie Mancuso of the New York Observer saw the animated adventures of Unit MNSKY as a metaphor of Gloria's journey in Los Angeles, stating \\"[a] single thought reverberates through Gloria‚Äôs mind the same way it echoes constantly from Unit MNSKY: 'I can help!' She doesn‚Äôt so much follow leads as she does drift from place to place, from unhelpful person to unhelpful person, stone-faced and persistent the entire way, until she arrives in the hospital room of an elderly Howard Zimmerman, horribly crippled from Thaddeus Mobley‚Äôs attack decades earlier. The poster on the wall behind his bed for Pleonexia Pictures isn‚Äôt exactly subtle ('pleonexia' is a term for extreme greed) and neither are the answers he gives Gloria. But the words do help, if only to sum up Gloria‚Äôs entire existence in a brief science lesson [...] And what else is Gloria doing here besides floating and colliding, existing then not existing? Despair becomes hope, becomes despair, becomes hope. The question, really, is whether or not these brief moments of collision and substance are worth it, fleeting may they be. Unfortunately for Gloria, in this particular case it is not.\\" Ben Travers of IndieWire discussed the episode's approach to technology through Gloria's. He felt that while the episode made the viewer relate to Gloria's views on technology, showing Sgt. Hunt's obsession with Facebook as shallow, or with Unit MNSKY being deemed obsolete at the end of his journey just like Gloria's new chief makes her feel like; however, it also \\"supported the advancement of society, to an admittedly lesser degree\\", with the absence of cell phones for Gloria and her son Nathan forcing her partner Donny to stop the school bus so she could talk to her son, or the fact that the WGA's records not being electronic forcing Gloria to wait a long time for the results. Questioning the symbolism of the mysterious useless box Gloria finds, he felt that it \\"felt targeted: Who would build such a useless machine? Every time you turn it on, it turns itself off. Does it represent Gloria‚Äôs feelings toward technology? That it‚Äôs more trouble than it‚Äôs worth? Is it a message left for her by someone ‚Äî Ray Wise‚Äôs omnipresent frequent flier, Paul Marrane? Is it a reverse macguffin, a literal object meant to mean more to the show‚Äôs themes than the plot itself?\\" Murray of Rolling Stone also discussed the meaning of the useless box, feeling that, just like the box turns itself off, the director and writers \\"barely have a chance to introduce all their characters before Gloria is on a flight home. Almost as soon as this Fargo installment gets switched on, it turns itself off\\". Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx noted that the switch of the useless box is very similar to the switch of Unit MNSKY when he, as well, turns himself off.  The law of noncontradiction  The title of the episode refers to the principle or law of noncontradiction, also known as the principle or law of contradiction: it is the second of three laws of thought in classical logic known as the three classic laws of thought. It states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, and that therefore something cannot be both true and false, or be and not be. Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx commented that several elements in the episode contradict the law of noncontradiction: \\"Gloria is a police chief who isn‚Äôt really a police chief anymore, running a department that no longer quite exists, still technically married to a man who is no longer her husband, investigating the death of a man who hadn‚Äôt been her stepfather in decades but still had a paternal (or grandpaternal) presence in her life, was Ennis Stussy but not really Ennis Stussy, and who once wrote the tale of a helper robot that never seemed to get a chance to help anyone, then proved enormously helpful to the entire universe. Even the novelty box that Gloria finds in the back of her motel closet is built to be a contradiction, existing only to turn itself off\\". In a scene in a bar, the character of Paul Marrane tells Gloria the tale of a soldier who goes off to war, first giving his wife a bill of divorce that becomes official if he doesn‚Äôt return within 12 months, but then retroactively takes effect from the moment he left; should he not return, this would mean that she would have been divorced during the last 12 months, despite the fact she had spent those months married to that very same man. This is a paradox and a contradiction to the law of noncontradiction.  Other  Regarding Zimmerman's speech to Gloria about quantum and the meaning of life, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club commented \\"Whether or not he‚Äôs right is up to the viewer, but while I‚Äôm not sure 'quantum' really enters into it, the episode does make an interesting case for how the accumulation of events can offer substance even if those events never yield any deeper meaning. Or else it‚Äôs a reminder that, if the collisions are what matter, we should make sure to check our aim first.\\" Rob McElhenney's character was seen by some critics as a reference to the TV series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and to Mac, the character he plays in it.

High blood sugar can be detected by sampling saliva. Saliva sampling may be a non-invasive way to detect changes in the gut microbiome and changes in systemic disease. Another example is tertiary syphilis, where changes to teeth can occur.https://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/ready-to- use/Manuals/Syphilis/syphilis-notes-2013.pdf Syphilis infection can be associated with longitudinal furrows of the tongue. Mineral and vitamin deficiencies can cause the tongue to appear beefy red and feel sore. Those deficiencies are iron, folate, and vitamin B12. A hairy tongue may be an indication of Epstein Barr virus infection and is usually seen in those infected with HIV. Other systemic diseases that can cause the tongue to form aphthous ulcers are: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, Behcet's Syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, herpes simplex, histoplasmosis, and reactive arthritis.  Cardiovascular and haematological system  A heart attack is a blood vessel in the heart being constricted either by a blood clot or atherosclerosis formation. A heart attack can cause pain the chest; sometimes this pain can radiate up to the jaw. (Malik et al., 2013) Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are medications prescribed for the treatment of a number of heart conditions and primarily to treat high blood pressure. They can cause gingival hypertrophy (overgrowth), particularly dihydropyridine and nifidipine. Poor dental hygiene and inflamed gums are a risk factor. The overgrowth is not permanent, it is suggested that if the medication is stopped then the overgrowth can reduce[ however, this is a decision that would have to be made in conjunction with the patient‚Äôs dentist and cardiologist as the risk of stopping some medications outweigh any advantage gained (Livada and Shiloah, 2013) Nicorandil is a medication that is prescribed for the treatment of angina. It can cause major apthous-like ulcer formation (BNF, 2020). Iron, folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies ‚Äì The most commonest cause of iron deficiencies is low ferritin; this can cause the tongue to appear beefy red and appear sore. It can also present in the mouth as angular chelitis, which is an infection caused by either staphylococcus or candidiasis, and can make the corners of the mouth appear red and crispy. Sickle cell disease is a hereditary genetic condition that results in deformed red blood cells to be formed. Sickle patients can suffer from sickle crisis, these are painful events in which if in the jaw can mimic dental pain and facial swelling can also occur during a crisis. The dental pulp can be affected by sickling and there may be a delayed eruption and hypoplasia of the dentition. Sickle patients are also at an increased risk of developing infection. Thalasseamias is a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the haemoglobin synthesis; it can result in either a reduced or absent globin chain production. If beta thalassaemia major is left untreated or under transfused, there is expansion of ineffective bone marrow, this leads to bony deformities resulting in dental malocclusion. Beta thalassaemia major patients may also be on bisphosphonates and are therefore at risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. Thrombocytopenia is a deficiency of platelets in the blood. It can present as red blood blisters in the mouth.  Respiratory system  Patients suffering from respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD can be prescribed steroidal inhalers to help strengthen their lungs. They must ensure after use that they rinse their mouths, otherwise there is an increase of dental caries, xerostomia, candidiasis, ulceration and gingivitis/periodontitis (Godara et al., 2011).  Renal System  There are a number of oral complications following renal transplantation. Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant medication that is used to help prevent patients from rejecting the transplanted kidney (BNF, 2020). Due to the immunosuppression (suppressed immune system), these patients are more likely to suffer from gingival hyperplasia, apthous ulceration, herpes simplex virus, oral leucoplakia; which may transform into squamous cell carcinoma, candidiasis infection or Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma (BNF, 2020).  Digestive System  There are many specific diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract which have an impact on oral health. Systemic disease can affect the upper GI tract such as Dysphagia, Dysmotility, Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD) and Peptic Ulcer's; or lower in the tract such as Coeliac‚Äôs, Crohn‚Äôs disease, Ulcerative Colitis and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Dysphagia is defined as a difficulty in swallowing. Structurally it worsens when eating solids and neurologically it is worse with fluids. Structural problems may include malignancy, stricture and pharyngeal pouching which can lead to halitosis, regurgitation of undigested food and high feeling of dysphagia. Neurological problems may be related to the patient having Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Motor Neurone Disease (MND) or having suffered from a Stroke. Dysphagia may present as a barrier to care in the dental setting as the patient may require high volume suction in order to maintain patient comfort and reduce the risk of aspiration of dental material/ fluids. GORD can present as retrosternal pain, acid brash and a hoarse voice. Risk factors for GORD are obesity, diet, smoking and hiatus hernia. Complications of which being oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, Strictures and ulcers. Common management of GORD include lifestyle measures, proton pump inhibitors and rarely surgery. The is a clear relationship between GORD and dental erosion and therefore can be detrimental to hard tissues i.e. teeth and also soft tissues of the mouth. Crohn's Disease is a patchy disease which can affect any area of the GI tract from the oral cavity to the anus. The manifestations depend on the affected area. The oral manifestations present as Orofacial Granulomatosis, an inflammatory condition affecting the oral mucosa. It is non-caveating granulomas and has a \\"Cobblestone\\" appearance. OFG can be isolated or a manifestation of Crohn's and can be treated with local or systemic corticosteroids. Aggravating factor of which is cinnamon, therefore a cinnamon-free diet is recommended. Eating disorders are a psychological problem which has an impact on the GI tract. Two common eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa is a refusal to maintain a \\"normal\\" body weight with a fear of weight gain and distorted perception of body image. Bulimia Nervosa is binge-eating followed by attempts to restrict weight gain and can include purging. Eating disorder oral manifestation is severe palatal erosion due to vomiting. There is occlusal erosion of the maxillary teeth causing the incised edges of the incisors to be thin and knife-edged. Occlusal surfaces have a flat to cupped- out appearance. Extra-orally eating disorders may present with swollen parotid glands. Other oral manifestations of GI disease is Angular Stomatitis, commonly seen in iron-deficient anaemia and mouth ulcers in Crohn's disease.  Endocrine System  Diabetes Mellitus has two main types: Type 1, autoimmune destruction of beta-cells leading to reduced insulin production and Type 2, the body becomes increasingly resistant to the effects of insulin leading to the bodies inability to regulate plasma glucose levels resulting in a fall in insulin production. Diabetes has numerous implications on oral health. Patient with Diabetes have increase extent and severity of Periodontal Disease, increased prevalence of Dental Caries due to Xerostomia, can suffer from Burning Mouth Syndrome and Candidal infections as well as experiencing altered taste sensation, altered tooth eruption and hypertrophy of the parotid glands. Other oral health problems include chronic hyperglycaemia, infection, delayed wound healing and Lichen Planus/Lichenoid reactions. The oral manifestations of Acromegaly predominate as spacing of the lower incisor teeth and widening of the mandible. Other complications include visual field defects, headaches, Diabetes, Sleep apnoea, Hypertension, Arthralgia and Arthritis and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Arthralgia and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome both have an impact on a patients‚Äô ability to maintain good oral hygiene practice and therefore may predispose them to Dental caries and Periodontal Disease. It is imperative these patients are given Enhanced Prevention in order to reduce the risk of Dental Caries and Periodontal Disease. Another endocrine disorder that may present orally is Addison‚Äôs Disease. Signs include skin hyperpigmentation, alabaster-coloured pale skin, low blood pressure, postural hypotension. Skin pigmentation have increased deposition in the palmer skin creases, nails and gingiva. Management of Addison‚Äôs is with steroids. During dental treatment the patient may require an increased dose of steroids based on treatment need.  Skeletal System  Osteopgenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, is caused by a gene mutation affecting the collagen genes, patients generally present with a large number of fractures from minor injuries. Teeth, if affected, are of the appearance of dentinogenesis imperfecta. Osteoporosis is a very common disease associated with a decreased bone mineral density, it mainly affects post menopausal women whose oestrogen levels have dropped. It is managed with the used of bisphosphonates. Prior to placement on bisphosphonates, a dental check must be done to extract any hopeless teeth as extractions in patients who have prolonged used of bisphosphonates are at risk of MRONJ. (SDCEP,2017)  Immune System  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infects and destroys cells of the immune system, principally the CD4+ T-Helper lymphocytes. As well as lymphocytes, CD4 receptors are also present on the surface of macrophages and monocytes, cells in the brain, skin, and probably many other sites.The normal CD4 count is 500-1500 therefore patient‚Äôs with HIV have a CD4 count less than 500. Patients that are HIV positive have increased risk of developing infections and tumours. The severity of illness is greater the lower the CD4 count. A CD4 count less than 200 is a diagnosis of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Oral manifestation of HIV include candidiasis, Oral Hairy Leukoplakia, oral ulcers, oral warts, oral lymphoma and Kaposi Sarcoma. Other presentations include gingivitis and oral malignancies. Treatment and management of HIV is based around highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). HAART has been proven to significantly lower prevalence of oral lesions, particularly oral candidiasis and oral hairy leukoplakia.  Nervous System   Muscular System   References.

History The palace was built in the 17th century during the reign of the Muradid Bey Hammuda Pasha Bey. In 1795 the Husainid Bey Hammuda Ibn Ali added another floor to it. Henri Dunant considers it as ¬´the most beautiful moorish royal house in the world¬ª.Henri Dunant, Notice sur la r√©gence de Tunis, Gen√®ve, Imprimerie de Jules-Guillaume Fick, 1858, 261 p.

Architecture  The palace's decoration is very rich and diverse with, as an example, sixteen twisted columns with their arches in white marble: the rooms were designed by Tunisian, Spanish and Moroccan artists. These rooms are distinguished by their special rooftops highly decorated with painted scenes and precious materials, as well as Andalusian style faience. The courtyard is paved in white marble and surrounded by a portico.Henri Saladin, Tunis et Kairouan, Paris, Henri Laurens, coll. \\"Les Villes d'art c√©l√®bres\\", 1908, p. 52-53 Dar El Bey.JPGFa√ßade of Dar El Bey in the Kasbah Kasbah-Kassus.jpgGeneral view of the palace  References   External links  El Bey ","title":"Dar El Bey"},{"id":"53977603","text":"Southern Fried Road Trip is a television show appearing on the Food Network.

Chekhov included it into Volume 3 of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899‚Äì1901. Synopsis Seryozha,A diminutive for Sergey a seven-year old, had been caught smoking, and his father Evgeny Petrovich, a court prosecutor, tries to put it to him how detrimental to one's health this habit is, and how wrong it is to steal somebody else's tobacco. All his efforts to impress his son prove to be futile, until finally, responding to a request, before sending Seryozha to bed, he tells him one of his improvisational fairytales, this one involving a young prince who dies young due to being a smoker and thus fails to fulfill his obligations towards his king father and his kingdom. Profoundly shaken by the tragedy, the boy solemnly decides not to have anything to do with tobacco again.

At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago, and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales.  Evidence for dimensional reduction The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory, causal dynamical triangulations, renormalization group approaches, noncommutative geometry, loop quantum gravity and Horava-Lifshitz gravity all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ¬± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ¬± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ¬± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ¬± 0.27 at small distances. Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  Possible explanations  The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow. At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? arXiv:0909.3329. A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime. Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light. Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.

Baccaglini is an eccentric personality, known for his career in television. In 2017, he made news by attempting to acquire the Palermo soccer club from former owner Maurizio Zamparini; the takeover, originally agreed in March 2017, was called off by June of the same year before being finalized.  Biography  Raised in the United States with an American father and Italian mother, Baccaglini was born in Chicago but spent most of his youth in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Baccaglini's mother came to the United States to study Neurobiology at Harvard University, while his father is from Washington. His parents separated when he was 15 years old. After graduating from high school, Baccaglini later moved to his mother's native Italy to pursue a career in Basketball. Baccaglini played two years with the Serie C Gold Unione Basket Padova basketball club from 2002 to 2003, concluding his brief career with the Solesino basketball club. = Television Personality = Leaving behind his sporting career, Baccaglini transitioned into work in radio, working for Radio Padova as host of the program \\"The Groove\\" for three years on RTL 102.5. Following his success in radio, Baccaglini began work for MTV and Italia 1, appearing regularly on the program Le Iene, on which he interviewed numerous personalities in politics. Baccaglini was known for his use of sarcasm and irony, and the program was well-known for deploying its hosts to dupe public figures for comic effect.

As part of the agreement, he was named as club chairman until the takeover was not finalized. In his initial press conference, he declared that his goal was to bring Palermo to be one of the best teams in Serie A, and to compete in the UEFA Champions League. Despite his initial enthusiasm for the potential takeover, Palermo's win-loss record did not improve enough to prevent the club from relegating to Serie B for the 2017-18 season. On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairman, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place.http://www.football-italia.net/105234/baccaglini-resigns-palermo- president References Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Chicago Category:Italian football chairmen and investors Category:Palermo F.C. chairmen and investors ","title":"Paul Baccaglini"},{"id":"53977993","text":"House Bill 1111, officially called An act to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 1, Chapter 3, relative to the construction of statutes, is a 2017 law in the state of Tennessee that added the following text: \\"undefined words shall be given their natural and ordinary meaning, without forced or subtle construction that would limit or extend the meaning of the language, except when a contrary intention is clearly manifest.\\"Bill Text: TN HB1111  2017-2018  110th General Assembly  Draft Passage On March 26, 2017, the Tennessee House of Representatives passed HB 1111, with 70 yeas and 23 nays.

G., Cornell, J. D., & Hall, C. A. (2001). Modeling the spatial pattern of land-use change with GEOMOD2: application and validation for Costa Rica. Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 85(1), 191-203. The model only simulates the spatial allocation of change between two land categories either forwards or backwards in time.Pontius Jr, R. G., & Chen, H. (2006). GEOMOD modeling. Clark University.  Simulation inputs  GeoMod simulates land change based on a combination of several input requirements. First, users must specify the beginning (time 1) and end time (time 2) for the temporal extent of the simulation and must identify a time step for the simulation. The model also needs the image that depicts the two land categories (e.g. category 1= undeveloped and category 2=developed) at time and a projected quantity of the two categories at time 2. GeoMod also needs a suitability map, which shows the transition suitability of each pixel. The higher values in the suitability map, the more suitable the pixel is for transition the gain of category 2. If the user does not have a suitability map, GeoMod can create one using one or more driver images. A driver image is a categorical image that indicates the distribution of a variable that is believed to influence the change of the land-cover categories.Dushku, A., & Brown, S. (2003, October). Spatial modeling of baselines for LULUCF Carbon projects: The GEOMOD modeling approach. In 2003 International Conference on Topical Forests and Climate Change:\\" Carbon Sequestration and the Clean Development Mechanism (Vol. 39). GeoMod can separate the analysis into strata, such as political units, and then simulate change independently within each stratum. If the quantity of change from time 1 to time 2 indicates a net gain of category 2 in a particular stratum, then GeoMod assumes zero gross loss of category 2 during the simulation, meaning GeoMod does not simulate simultaneous gain and loss of an individual category within an individual stratum. GeoMod allocates change based on several user-defined decision rules, which are discussed in section 3. = Optional inputs = In addition to the mandatory simulation inputs listed above, there are several additional optional data inputs. # A mask can differentiate between the background and the spatial extent of the study area. # Driver image(s) can be used to create the suitability map. # A land category map at time 2 (end time) can be used to automatically set the time 2 pixel counts for both category 1 and category 2. # A stratification image can stratify the simulation by stratum. Strata are regions of analysis, e.g. countries, states, counties. GeoMod can simulate land change in some strata from category 1 to category 2, and in other strata from category 2 to category 1. If a stratification image is used, the user must specify the quantity of pixels for the two categories at time 2 for each individual stratum.  Environmental impact analysis  GeoMod can also analyze the environmental impact on the pixels that undergo change within a specified time interval. This optional feature requires an image showing the environmental resource of interest, an image showing the ratio of the potential impact to the environmental resource of interest, and an image showing the ratio of simulated impact to potential impact. If the latter two images are not available, a fixed ratio for the entire study area may be used.  GeoMod decision rule for allocating change  = Decision rule 1 = Decision rule 1 is mandatory and assumes a one-way change either forward or backwards in time within each stratum. The model determines which category experiences a net increase and then simulates gross gain in that category and zero gross loss of that category. = Decision rule 2 = Decision rule 2 is optional and it concerns regional stratification. Rule 2 can allow for change from category 1 to category 2 in some strata and from category 2 to category 1 in other strata. When using regional stratification, the user has to specify the quantity for each category at time 2 in each stratum. = Decision rule 3 = Decision rule 3 is also optional and it focuses on the neighborhood constraint. GeoMod can geographically limit the simulated change to pixels that are on the edge between category 1 and category 2.de Benito, B. P., & de Pe√±as, J. G. (2008). Greenhouses, land use change, and predictive models: MaxEnt and Geomod working together. In Modelling environmental dynamics (pp. 297-317). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. The model can thus apply a user-defined minimum search width to constrain where simulated change occurs. = Decision rule 4 = Decision rule 4 is also optional and concerns a suitability map. When simulating the transition from category 1 to category 2, GeoMod simulates change from the category 1 pixels that have the largest suitability values.  Validation  Pattern validation shows how the simulated change compares to reference change, for cases where a reference map is available for validation. A visual approach makes use of the CROSSTAB module in TerrsSet by comparing three maps simultaneously: Reference time 1, Reference time 2, and Simulated time 2. Additionally, the Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) curve may be used to compare the suitability map to a map of reference change. Terrset has a module called ROC, which can assist in the selection thresholds for the TOC.Batchu, K., & Pontius, R.G. (2003).

Lloyd Webber, who was the father of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, was the organist and choirmaster of All Saints, Margaret Street, London between 1939 and 1948. From 1958 he served as director of music at the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. During this time, he composed two Latin masses, Princeps Pacis in 1962 and Missa Sanctae Mariae Magdalenae in 1979. The title \\"Prince of Peace\\" was part of a prophecy by Isaiah (), which Handel had used in the chorus For unto us a child is born in part I of his Messiah. The mass sets all part of the Mass Ordinary except the Credo, and is thus a missa brevis. The mass was published in 1962 under the English title Mass \\"The Prince of Peace\\", with the dedication \\"to my friend Father Wilfred Purney with affection\\". It was recorded by Chandos in 1997, styled \\"Mass: 'Princeps Pacis'\\", as part of the album Invocation, a collection of works by William Lloyd Webber, with the Westminster Singers and organist Ian Watson and conducted by Richard Hickox. It was published under its Latin title in the William Lloyd Webber Centenary Collection by Kevin Mayhew.

Later, for the distribution of anti-fascist leaflets, he was sent to the concentration camp Buchenwald in the 8th children's block, where 300 children aged 10 to 17 years were imprisoned. In the fall of 1944, a 7-year-old Polish Jew, Yurchik (Lyolik), got into his unit, despite the fact that he was so small that he had the status of a political prisoner. Fedor Mikhailichenko, at the time only 18 years old, helped Yurchik to survive in the concentration camp, stealing potatoes from the Germans to feed the young boy.

Background Rumaythah was one of 30 sons of Abu Numayy I, who ruled Mecca between 1254 and 1301. His laqab was Asad al- Din and his kunya was Abu Aradah. It is reported that he was also named Munajjad. First reign, in partnership with Humaydah Rumaythah and his brother Humaydah were proclaimed as joint emirs in Safar 701 AH (October 1301), two days before Abu Numayy's death. They were initially opposed by a faction of the ashraf who supported their brothers Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah. Humaydah emerged predominant and imprisoned Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah. However, they managed to escape and when the hajj season arrived they gained the favor of the Egyptian emirs, chief among them Baybars al-Jashnakir. Consequently, in Dhu al-Hijjah 701 AH (August 1302), after the completion of the hajj rites, Baybars arrested Humaydah and Rumaythah, and installed their brothers to the throne. Baybars returned to Cairo in Muharram 702 AH, with Humaydah and Rumaythah in chains.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/134‚Äì136 In 703 AH the brothers were released from prison. The sultan al-Nasir Muhammad dressed them in traditional Mamluk costume with kalafatah caps of zarkash (brocade). They were granted stipends, joined the ranks of the sultan's emirs, and rode with the sultan on the maydan (parade grounds).al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/137‚Äì138 Second reign, in partnership with Humaydah In 704 AH the shaykh Nasr al-Manbiji interceded for Humaydah and Rumaythah to forego Mamluk attire in favor of their own Hejazi dress. Later that year the sultan reappointed them to the emirate of Mecca, as he had become displeased with their brothers. They accompanied the annual hajj caravan from Cairo, and in Dhu al-Hijjah 704 AH (July 1305), after the completion of the hajj rites, Baybars al-Jashnakir arrested Abu al-Ghayth and Utayfah and installed Humaydah and Rumaythah to the throne.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/140‚Äì142 Humaydah and Rumaythah initially acted justly and instituted popular policies including repeals of some of the mukus taxes. However in the following years they became guilty of various misdeeds and abuses. As a result, during the hajj of 710 AH (1311) they left Mecca to avoid an Egyptian force that was sent against them. In 712 AH (1313) they again abandoned Mecca when al-Nasir himself performed the pilgrimage with a large army.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al- war√°, 3/145‚Äì149 Finally, in Shawwal 713 AH (January/February 1314) al-Nasir dispatched an army to install Abu al-Ghayth to the throne, with 320 Mamluk cavalry and 500 horsemen from the Banu Husayn of Medina. The Egyptian emirs were Sayf al-Din Taqsuba al-Nasiri, Wali of Qus and commander of the army, Sayf al-Din Baktamur, Sarim al-Din Saruja al-Husami, and Ala al-Din Aydughdi al-Khwarizmi. They were joined from Damascus by the emir Sayf al-Din Balaban al-Tatari. When Humaydah and Rumaythah heard of the army's approach they fled towards Haly Bani Ya'qub.al-Najm Ibn Fahd, It·∏•ƒÅf al-war√°, 3/150‚Äì152 Third reign On 3 Jumada II 715 AH (September 1315) Rumaythah arrived at the court of al-Nasir in Cairo. He received pardon from the sultan and sought support against Humaydah, who had deposed and killed Abu al-Ghayth. Al-Nasir sent Rumaythah back to the Hejaz with an army led by the emirs Najm al-Din Damurkhan ibn Qaraman and Sayf al-Din Taydamur al-Jamadar. Six days before the army's arrival, Humaydah loaded up a hundred camels with money and goods, burned what was left in the castle at Wadi Marr, and destroyed two thousand date palms. Then he made his way to al-Khalf wal-Khulayf, a castle six days journey from Mecca, and sought refuge with its master. Rumaythah and the Egyptians reached Mecca on Saturday, 15 Ramadan (13 December 1315), then after two weeks they pursued Humaydah. They looted the castle at al-Khalf wal- Khulayf and captured Humaydah's wealth and 12-year-old son, who was handed over to Rumaythah, but Humaydah himself escaped to Iraq. After the completion of the Hajj of 717 AH‚Äîeither in late 717 or early 718 AH (February/March 1318)‚ÄîRumaythah was overthrown by his slaves and Humaydah assumed the Emirate. He replaced the name of al-Nasir in the khutbah with that of the Ilkhanid Sultan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan. Fourth reign In Safar 718 AH (April 1318) al-Nasir sent an army to capture Humaydah led by the Emirs Sarim al-Din Uzbak al-Jurmaki, Sayf al-Din Bahadur al-Ibrahimi, and Badr al-Din Muhammad ibn Isa ibn al-Turkmani. They reached Mecca in late Rabi al-Awwal 718 AH (May 1318) and restored the Emirate to Rumaythah. On Tuesday, 14 Dhu al-Hijjah 718 AH (6 February 1319) the Emir Shams al-Din Aq Sunqur al-Nasiri arrested Rumaythah and al-Ibrahimi and took them prisoner back to Cairo. He alleged that Rumaythah had provided covert support to Humaydah and that al-Ibrahimi had intentionally allowed Humaydah to escape. Al-Ibrahimi was also accused of perpetrating other misdeeds in Mecca. After reaching Cairo in Muharram 719 AH (March 1319) Rumaythah received pardon from al-Nasir and was once again appointed to the ranks of the Sultan's emirs, with a monthly salary of 1000 dirhams. He was replaced as Emir of Mecca by his brother Utayfah. In Rabi al- Thani (June 1319) Rumaythah attempted to escape to the Hejaz. He was caught at Haql, returned to Cairo, and imprisoned. Fifth reign After Humaydah's death in 720 AH (1320) al-Nasir released Rumaythah from prison. On 23 Dhu al- Qidah 720 AH () Rumaythah arrived in Mecca with the Vice-Sultan Sayf al-Din Arghun and was installed as co-Emir alongside Utayfah. In early 721 AH (1321) al-Nasir the Banu Hasan swore allegiance to Rumaythah, and Rumaythah began publicly supporting Zaydi Shi'ism in Mecca. In 726 AH (1326) al-Nasir summoned Rumaythah to Cairo, then ordered Utayfah to expel the Zaydi imam from Mecca. By the Hajj season Rumaythah had returned to Mecca, still serving as joint Emir. In 730 AH (1330) Rumaythah and Utayfah quarreled. That year Rumaythah did not meet the Egyptian amir al-rakab, nor was he invested with the annual robe of honor alongside his brother. On Friday, 14 Dhu al-Hijjah 730 AH (28 September 1330) fighting in the Masjid al-Haram resulted in the death of Emir Aldamur al-Nasiri and a number of other pilgrims. Utayfah and his son Mubarak were involved in the fighting. In response al-Nasir decided to depose Utayfah and appoint Rumaythah as sole Emir of Mecca. The Egyptian army reached Mecca on 7 Rabi II () encountering no resistance, as Utayfah and Rumaythah had already fled the city with the rest of the ashraf in fear of al-Nasir's punishment. Sixth and seventh reigns After negotiations with the Egyptian emirs, Rumaythah was proclaimed Emir of Mecca in the beginning of Jumada I 731 AH () and Utayfah was taken back to Egypt. In 734 AH (1333/1334) al-Nasir appointed Utayfah as joint Emir, but Rumaythah deposed him after the Hajj in August 1334. Utayfah returned with the Hajj the following year. In 736 AH (1335/1336) the brothers quarreled, and Utayfah established himself in Mecca while Rumaythah established himself at al-Jadid in Wadi Marr. On 28 Ramadan 736 AH () Rumaythah attacked Mecca in an attempt to unseat Utayfah. He was unsuccessful and a number of his men were killed, including his vizier. Neither Rumaythah nor Utayfah performed the Hajj that year. In 737 AH (1336/1337) Rumaythah and Utayfah reconciled. After a trip to al-Wadiyayn in Yemen, they returned to Mecca in Sha'ban (March 1337). They then traveled to Egypt in response to summons from al-Nasir. On 10 Dhu al-Qi'dah (June 1337) Rumaythah returned to Mecca, having been confirmed as sole Emir of Mecca. Utayfah was detained in Egypt and would remain there until his death. In 744 AH (1343/1345) Rumaythah was compelled to abdicate by his sons Thaqabah and Ajlan in exchange for 60,000 dirhams. Sultan al-Salih Isma'il summoned Thaqabah to Cairo and had him arrested, and in Dhu al-Qi'dah 744 AH (March/April 1344) sent a decree returning the Emirate to Rumaythah. Ajlan fled to Yemen, but he reconciled with Rumaythah after the departure of the Hajj. In 746 AH al-Salih summoned Ajlan to Cairo and appointed him Emir of Mecca. He returned on 14 Jumada al-Thani () accompanied by 50 mamluks. On 18 Jumada al-Thani Rumaythah summoned Ajlan to the qubba of Zamzam where he formally abdicated. Rumaythah died in Mecca on Friday, 8 Dhu al-Qi'dah 746 AH (3 March 1346). The janazah prayer was performed in the Masjid al-Haram at the time of Jumu'ah. When the Zaydi imam Abu al-Qasim ibn al-Shughayf came forward to officiate, he was prevented from doing so by the chief qadi Shihab al-Din al-Tabari, a Shafi'i.

It was built during the 1890s for Hamilton McKown Twombly and his wife, Florence Adele Vanderbilt, a member of the Vanderbilt family. Now part of the Florham Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University, the mansion is one of the ten largest houses in the United States of America.  Early history  Florham's history can be divided into two parts: the establishment of the estate by the family during the Gilded Age, and the 'consecration' of the estate from a temporal use to an intellectual use as the home of Fairleigh Dickinson University. = Building Florham = Florham was built between 1893 and 1899 by Florence Adele Vanderbilt and her husband, Hamilton McKown Twombly, to be the couple's country estate. Florence, the youngest and favorite grandchild of the transportation tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, married Twombly in 1877 after meeting him at the two families' summering spots in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1893, the couple commissioned the famous firm of McKim, Mead & White (the architects of the Old Penn Station and Rhode Island State House) to build Florham as the country setting to raise their family. The architects' instructions were to build \\"a house on the order of an English country gentleman ... a thoroughly comfortable house, without the stiffness of the modern city house.\\" Beginning in 1891, some 1,200 acres were acquired in 37 purchases to assemble a property on Madison's \\"millionaire's row\\", a neighborhood that was home to several other Gilded Age estates belonging to the Rockefellers, Dodges and Mellons. Wren wing of Hampton Court Palace, the inspiration for Florham With 110 rooms, McKim, Mead & White designed what remains today as one of the ten largest houses in the United States. Florham's design was principally inspired by Sir Christopher Wren's late 17th-century expansion of Hampton Court Palace under King William III and Queen Mary II, evident especially in the house's lay-out, pillars, and contrasting stone and red brick. The furnishing of the house's interior, overseen mainly by Stanford White, included several Barberini tapestries, a Louis XV ballroom and several Renaissance fireplaces purchased from noble Italian homes. Another famous New Jerseyian, Thomas Edison, whose initial electrical projects were supported by the joint effort of Twombly and J.P. Morgan, personally designed the mansion's heating system and boiler in a tunnel system beneath the house. The estate also included vast greenhouses, including an orangery which still stands today as part of Fairleigh Dickinson's library, a dairy farm, stables, gatehouse and carriage house. The celebrated architect of New York's Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted, was commissioned as the 'landscape architect' of the estate, designing the Italianate gardens that survive today. Olmsted also designed other Vanderbilt estates, including Biltmore. Setting the site of the mansion on a hill overlooking the Passaic Valley and Black Brook meadows, Olmsted told Twombly \\"You have a sweep of landscape to an infinitely remote and perspectively obscure background ... as much so as if you owned the state of New Jersey.\\" Between the purchase of the land, the construction of the mansion, greenhouses, stables, and farm, and the furnishing of the mansion, the cost of the entire estate came to about $5,000,000 (a cost of about $146,000,000 in 2017 dollars). McKim Mead and White also brought over 600 laborers and families from Italy to build and later work on the estate ‚Äî especially as rose cultivators. This community founded the base for Madison's large Italian community. The family, though often in New York or Newport, spent a majority of its time at Florham and developed a relationship with the local community. The family were all members of Grace Episcopal Church in Madison, which was restored in Florence's memory in 1952. The Grace Episcopal Church Boychoir, well known and admired in the area, sang annually at the estate, when it was treated to a lavish Christmas feast with full wait- staff.Geissler, Suzanne B., \\"History of Grace Church: 1854-1984,\\" (1987, Madison, NJ), p. http://03925f5.netsolhost.com/wp2014/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/History-of-Grace-Church.pdf Grace Church's Tiffany stained-glass windows, one a memorial to Alice Twombly, a daughter who tragically died in 1896 at age 16, can all be seen today in the lively parish.

Of Florence's two surviving children, Ruth Twombly and Florence Twombly Burden, only Florence Burden married and had two sons. By the time of Florence Vanderbilt's death in 1952, however, much of the country's industrial and landed elite had disappeared in the social changes that came with World War II. The Burden family could not continue Florham's lifestyle, and the estate was broken up and sold in 1955. None of the numerous Vanderbilt estates remained in the family, other than Biltmore. Arthur T. Vanderbilt II noted: > These magnificent country homes ... were built to become precisely the > equivalent of those Old World palaces, great ancestral homes that would > proclaim for centuries, for all time, the prominence of the Vanderbilts ... > But it did not work out that way. Far from becoming ancestral homes, these > monuments to limitless wealth, built for eternity, were hardly used for a > lifetime. None was occupied by the next generation. Several months before the estate sale auction, William Burden, husband to Florence Twombly Burden, gifted dozens of the house's interior fittings to the White House. Many of these items remain in the White House collection, including several chairs from the estate, which have sat in the Oval Office under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Fairleigh Dickinson University  Panorama of the main approach to the mansion at Florham Florence and her daughter Ruth died in 1952 and 1954, respectively, and the estate was broken up, with the bulk of the lower portion, occupied by the dairy farm and stables, going to Exxon, later to be sub-developed into a corporate park. The mansion, with 178 acres of gardens, the carriage house and greenhouses were sold in 1957 to the expanding Fairleigh Dickinson University, to be the school's Morris County campus. Funded by Colonel Fairleigh S. Dickinson in Rutherford, NJ, to be a liberal arts school for Northern New Jersey, the University now has 4 campuses in three countries. The founding president of Fairleigh Dickinson, Peter Sammartino, oversaw the purchase of the estate, hasty renovation, and its opening to students in the fall of 1958. The carriage house was remodeled as the University's science labs, and the orangery was preserved and now functions as reading room of the campus library. While pieces of the estate have been remodeled for educational use, the University has been careful to preserve its history and environment. Realizing the responsibility and opportunity of this Vanderbilt treasure, the University has been engaged in the gradual restoration of both the mansion and grounds. In 1990, the Friends of Florham was founded for volunteers who research the building's history and donate to its upkeep.

Music has historically been a medium of expression for the African American community. The community's traditional music was carried to the United States via the slave trade and adapted while they worked on plantations, eventually developing into various genres such as the blues, rock, gospel music, jazz, bluegrass, and many other popular genres. This legacy starts in the 1870s with the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who performed many different genres of black music including traditional spirituals, blues, classic jazz and rhythm and blues, also commonly referred to as R&B.; The Fisk Jubilee Singers became popular throughout the world for singing traditional spirituals during their tours in both the United States and England. Sexist attitudes during the early 20th century made it difficult for African-American women to have a strong presence in mainstream music. Despite this, women were still extremely influential in the genres of blues, jazz, and R&B.;  Early Music and the Harlem Renaissance  = Jazz = The return of African American soldiers from World War I and the Great Migration both contributed to Harlem's rise as a hive of cultural and artistic activity. It was recognized as the Harlem Renaissance, which allowed for the flowering of music, poetry, and art in the Black community. Jazz music is a musical genre through which many African American artists express their feelings of pain, joy, and freedom. It originated in New Orleans, making its way to Chicago through the diaspora of black southerners during the Great Migration. By the end of the 1920s, Chicago had become the music metropolis for jazz. Jazz was a genre strongly dominated by men. Although female artists held a strong presence, their achievements were less celebrated. African-American women were not only jazz singers, but also instrumentalists. The piano was one of the first instruments that women played in jazz music, and this ability granted women a great degree of acceptance in the industry. Mary Lou Williams, a popular pianist, is sometimes referred to as one of America's best known and revered jazz women. Williams gained her first spot light in her home town, Kansas City, where she developed into one of the most \\"sought after pianists in Kansas City\\". Through her compositions, Williams is said to have influenced the evolution of the \\"big band\\" sound. It was because of her innovative writing techniques that Williams gained the opportunity to compose for many well known jazz innovators such as Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington. Williams did not move into the New York Area until the early 1940s. It was during this time that a new style, \\"bebop\\", was emerging, and she easily transitioned into composing music for this sub-genre of jazz. She later went on to lead various women's music groups, and founded one of the first female- owned recording companies. Due to unfair treatment of women, most could not make it in the industry as individual performers, but all women jazz bands and family-based jazz groups were popular. During World War II, many male jazz musicians were drafted to fight in the war, so all female bands had the opportunity to gain popularity. Some of these bands included Darlings of Rhythm and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. In later years, African- American women were able to succeed as individual singers. Some of the most successful names include Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Lena Horne, and Billie Holiday. Ella Fitzgerald, known as ‚ÄúThe First Lady of Song‚Äù, sold over 40 million records and won 13 Grammy Awards. = Blues = The blues came to the North as newly freed African Americans began to migrate from the areas surrounding Mississippi toward the bustling cities for work. Although no specific date is provided for the origin of the Blues, many believe that the roots of the blues generated from the songs of working Black slaves and life on the plantation. The earliest instances of Blues performances were presented by songsters that would travel throughout the South, but there had yet to be any record presence for Black artists. The 1920s blues, known as the classic blues, was a genre largely popularized by African-American women. Singers such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Alberta Hunter, and Ethel Waters were the most popular, each bringing something new and unique to the stage of American music.[2] Ma Rainey, referred to as the \\"Mother of the Blues\\", became popular in the early 1900s. Rainey was the first popular black female stage entertainer to incorporate authentic blues into her song selection. She is known for the ‚ÄúJump Blues‚Äù which incorporated a racy and theatrical style, whereas Bessie Smith, who was known as the \\"empress of the blues‚Äù showcased the classic blues. Unfortunately, as male-dominated country blues grew in popularity women fell out of the spotlight. During the blues revival, about 30 years later, Mamie Smith became the first black female vocalist to record a blues song. While ‚ÄúCrazy Blues‚Äù is cited as the first blues recording, it also represents the emergence of black female singers into popular music culture. Both black and white consumers purchased the record, and record company executives recognized it as a lucrative marketing segment.  R&B; and its descendants  = R&B; = Soul and R&B; have their roots in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. These genres focused on breaking down the barriers between black and white Americans. Most of the singers in this genre had Southern roots and sang in their churches. Artists in this genre include Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Bessie Smith, with the most well-known being Aretha Franklin. Aretha Franklin gained prominence in the 1960s. Franklin signed her record deal at the age of eighteen after singing at her church in Detroit. She was most successful working with artists whose background stemmed from gospel music. She chose to follow this path and reinvented herself landing five number one hits and a Grammy. In 1967 and 1968, Franklin reached commercial success, recording more than a dozen million-selling singles. Mahalia Jackson was another female artist known as the \\"Queen of Gospel\\" who had an impact on the civil rights movement with her songs. Aretha Franklin actually covered one of her more popular songs, How I Got Over. It was a more upbeat version with James Cleveland and The Southern California Community Choir. Both Aretha Franklin and Mahalia Jackson had major songs during the civil rights movement: Franklin's version of Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\" and Jackson's \\"I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned\\", which she performed at the march on Washington after being asked by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/08/14/how-aretha- franklins-respect-became-an-anthem-for-civil-rights-and-feminism/ Despite their role in popularizing black music and culture, few black women are recognized in the emergence of rap and hip-hop culture in the 1970s-1980s. = 'Gangsta' rap = A version of hip hop emerged in the 1990s that transformed the upbeat music of earlier decades into a genre that glorified the violent lifestyle of America's inner cities, often romanticising poverty, drug use, drug dealing and gang violence. This genre of music has been criticized for sexually objectifying not only women of color but all women. ‚ÄúHip-hop scholars have argued that the sexual stereotypes of African American women found in music videos such as The Diva, Gold Digger, Freak, and Baby Mama-inform and reflect broader beliefs about black women‚Äôs sexuality‚Äù. The language used in modern rap music has been criticized for being demeaning to women, in particular for the prevalence of slang terms such as ‚Äúbitch,‚Äù ‚Äúhoe,‚Äù \\"slut,\\" or ‚Äúthot‚Äù. = Hip-Hop Feminism = ‚ÄúHip-Hop Feminism‚Äù has its roots in attempts to reclaim the positive position of black women in the music industry. It is concerned with how the conservative backlash of the 1980s and 1990s deindustrialization, the slashing of the welfare state, and the attendant gutting of social programs and affirmative action along with the increasing racial wealth gap, have affected the lived worlds and world views of the hip-hop generation. Hip-hop feminism also aimed at reclaiming the sexualization of black women as pleasurable and consensual. An example of hip- hop feminism that rose to fame through YouTube is the ‚ÄúBoss Ass Bitch‚Äù Rap, written by P.T.A.F. The message of ‚ÄúBoss Ass Bitch‚Äù is dynamic in its demonstration of the girls‚Äô commitment to ingenuity. The rappers Kandi, K'Duce, and Aliz√© claim that by rapping they are redeeming the title of ‚Äúbitch‚Äù and their sexuality. ‚ÄúJillian and Anya did not aim to uphold Minaj and P.T.A.F. as the standard bearers of girl/woman of colour feminism, but as examples of practiced feminism, among many others, that should be engaged with complexity because they produce forms of pleasure that are so often vilified.‚Äù Hip-hop feminism has had a political impact with regards to the rights of women, African Americans, and the LGBT community. Because of this, hip-hop feminism has been largely shaped by a sociopolitical agenda. This has created a second and third wave of black American feminist artists, both of whom share a different argument through their songs. However, there are theoretical and practical linkages between the generations and their music. Queen Latifah is one of hip hop's most notable MCs. Her music is known for her pro-black & pro- feminist themes. One aspect of hip-hop feminism is its use of ‚Äúthe politics of respectability‚Äù, a term coined by Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, which describes several strategies for progressive black female artists to more effectively promote a message of racial uplift and women's rights to a bigger audience. These methods largely regard notions of self-respect, honour, piety, and propriety. Respectability politics has been a useful way for improving conditions for African-Americans, by providing black female artists with a platform to talk about the de jure and de facto racist and misogynistic practices they experience. More recently there has been an emergence of queer feminists of color in hip-hop. One example of this is Me‚ÄôShell Ndegeocello, who made her debut in 1993. In her lyrics, Ndegeocello brings to the forefront the realities that the black community faces, such as abortion, low-income housing, and unfair US beauty standards. She begins by talking about her own black, queer experiences in her song, ‚ÄúLeviticus Faggot‚Äù, where she targets homophobia in her lyrics by directing the audience's attention to the misogynist and sexist violence that black men are subject to because of their sexual identity. You see this especially in the lyrics, ‚ÄúCause the man kicked the faggot out the house at 16, Amen mother let it be, Before long he was crowned queen for all the world to see.‚Äù Ndegeocello's lyrics further explore her queer identity in desires in songs like ‚ÄúMary Magdalene‚Äù and ‚ÄúPocketbook‚Äù. Angie Stone‚Äôs song ‚ÄúMy People‚Äù sought to express that African Americans can be and are successful in American society. Not only is Angie Stone highlighting the potentially political nature of soul music, she also defies the most common notion of soul female singers adhering to lyrics regarding men and past relationships. Hip Hop soul allowed women to create an aesthetic that represented and engaged politics of sexuality and gender in working-class black communities. By allowing women in hip-hop soul to offer narratives that highlighted their multidimensional nature, they offered other black women experiences to relate to.African American Review, Volume 46, Number 1, Spring 2013, pp.87-99 Hip-hop soul initially limited the black female voice to that of relationships with men and what that impact has on them. The shift from male-dominated hip-hop to women-centered as well as women-told hip-hop soul highlights the shift in previous perceptions of women within hip-hop culture. Rapper and actress Queen Latifah made history when she won a Grammy for her groundbreaking hit, ‚ÄúU.N.I.T.Y.,‚Äù in 1995. The song spoke out against domestic violence and the objectification of Black female sexuality. ‚ÄúU.N.I.T.Y.‚Äù began a conversation in the African American community over violence and assault against women. It also established that Black women rappers had a powerful voice in a field dominated by men.  Contemporary Music Industry  Today, female rappers are challenging male rappers' sexist lyrics, and using rap lyrics to define an independent Black female identity. Examples include Queen Latifah, Salt 'N' Pepa, MC Lyte and Eve, who criticize men who abuse and manipulate women. Even more women ( Beyonc√©, Lauryn Hill, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Kehlani, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and Zap Mama) use hip-hop as a platform to empower black women and other minorities around the world. Black women have positioned themselves as an influential force in the music industry and an essential element within our nation's popular culture. Queen Latifah is one of the biggest influences in the music industry, mainly because she came in at such a young age and has since transformed herself into a successful individual. She released her album, All Hail the Queen at a young age. The album had feminist themes that attracted a wide audience. Queen Latifah wanted to be respected and did not agree with misogyny. ‚ÄúI had a problem with [misogyny]. I was never the kind of person that was going to take something lying down,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd maybe that‚Äôs my father‚Äôs influence on me. I just was raised to protect myself and stand up for myself and speak my mind and be true. And even if I had to stand alone, I was to do that.‚Äù Queen Latifah promoted women's importance, demanding equal treatment of women, and the importance of women supporting each other.\\"Ladies First\\": Queen Latifah's Afrocenric Feminist Music Video, Robin Robetrs She was the first female MC to ever go gold which paved the way for other women rappers. Black Reign was her most popular album and included her biggest single, U.N.I.T.Y, which won a Grammy for Best Solo Rap Performance. Another independent contemporary music artist is Rihanna. She has won six Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, and twenty-two Billboard Music Awards. She's the youngest solo artist to have 13 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Rihanna created a foundation to help terminally ill children. She has also supported charities and foundations to help build a breast cancer screening and treatment centre. Rihanna was named 2017 Harvard University Humanitarian of the year. Alicia Keys has been called a modern Renaissance woman. Alicia Keys is a feminist who believes in advocating for women's rights and regarding political, social, and economical rights. She has won 14 Grammy awards and has co-founded the Keep a Child Alive foundation. She started the foundation to make treatment available to people in Africa and to focus on children by supporting clinics that provided this treatment. Kehlani who comes from the Bay was influenced by growing up in \\"the hood\\". She is openly bisexual and her music is about both male and female significant others. Kehlani has been opened about her life period, about her sexuality, relationships, her depression, being slut shamed, and her music. Many women are ridiculed for telling and doing so much but Kehlani stands up and stands out. She speaks up in her music. One song in particular, Body Count by Jessie Reyez, talks about women getting their freedom back. She is also multiracial. Beyonc√© Knowles has won 20 Grammys, and is the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard's album charts. Knowles most recent work, Lemonade, contends with the issues black women face while living in America. For example, the song ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù \\"which talks about blackness in America, includes amazing visuals of various fierce black women who proudly rock picked-out afros and other dynamic hairstyles in scenes that reflect and reaffirm black beauty‚Äù. The visual for ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù contains powerful, moving images of black women who have lost black men in their lives, including Gwen Carr, Sybrina Fulton, and Lezley McSpadden, whom are the mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and Michael Brown, respectively. Sylvia Rhone, who is now CEO of Epic Records, has been a pioneer in the music business for decades. She began her career in the music industry with Buddha Records in 1974, and went on to spend time at ABC Records, Ariola Records, Elektra, Atlantic Records, and finally Epic Records. Rhone has gone on to discover and/or mentor several renowned current artist including DJ Khaled, 21 Savage, Camila Cabello, Travis Scott, Future, Meghan Trainor, French Montana, and many more.  Influence of Music Videos  Studies have shown that Black women are underrepresented in hip-hop and rap music videos. When comparing the most popular music videos, various studies have concluded that men are more likely to be the main character and background characters than women. Conrad's analysis of 108 hip-hop music videos containing 549 characters found 53% of the people within the videos were male. Furthermore, the women who were represented were mostly in supporting roles. When black women are represented, it is often in a way that reinforces stereotypical gender roles. Specifically, women are more likely to be shown in submissive positions to men. Black women are also heavily sexualized in hip-hop and rap music videos. They are referred to as video \\"thots\\",\\"hoes\\" or \\"vixens\\". They are often wearing revealing clothing, like lingerie or swimsuits. Many scholars have argued that women are sexualized in these videos to enhance the hyper-masculinity of the featured male rappers. When Black females perform in music videos, they are typically seen in the Eurocentric form of beauty: lighter skinned and thin. This specific image is what rap and R&B; music videos are looking for, including those that portray black females as main or background characters.Turner, Jacob S. ‚ÄúSex and the Spectacle of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos.‚Äù Sex Roles, vol. 64, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. 173‚Äì191.Proquest, doi:10.1007/s11199-010-9766-6. In 2004, women at Spelman College protested a bone-marrow drive sponsored by Nelly over the visuals in his latest music video Tip Drill. The video featured dozens of women dancing in thong bikinis dancing around a swimming pool and on men. The scene that has caused the most uproar is a visual of Nelly swiping a credit card through a woman's buttocks. Even 15 years later, the producer of the video, Kareem johnson, defends the video and the credit card scene specifically stating ‚ÄúIf the girls weren‚Äôt in the video, this wouldn‚Äôt be a conversation. They were willing participants. That‚Äôs the part that was missed. The model never requested the scene to be edited. If Nelly has to be held accountable, so does the model. Responsibility needs to be shared.‚Äù Both black and white women are subjected to the male gaze: an object of sexuality for the pleasure of both the viewer and the male character or artist. The female's sexuality is explicit through both their actions and style of dress; women are seen in revealing, tight clothing and most often performing sexual dance moves. Black women are seen as being more ‚Äúopen and free‚Äù with their sexuality, going along with the stereotype of hypersexuality of black females over white females, who are seen as being ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù and restrained with their bodies and sexuality. There are men that tend to hyper-sexualize women in music videos and their excuse is that some women feel like it is empowering . A study led by psychologist Susan Fiske of Princeton found when presented with images of a woman's sexualized body, some men's brains associated her with an object, rather than an agent of action.

He was a second round pick (77th overall) in the 2012 MLB draft. Cozens made his major league debut with the Philadelphia Phillies in .  Early life  Cozens was born in Scottsdale, Arizona. His father Randy played football for four years as a defensive lineman at the University of Pittsburgh, and was drafted in the 17th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos, but never played for them. Cozens initially attended Desert Mountain High School in Arizona, but was suspended midway through his junior year for an altercation with his baseball coach. Baseball writer Keith Law reported that Cozens \\"shoved his coach and told him to 'f off' in the dugout during a game, so he was kicked off the team - the culmination of a series of incidents that turned many scouts off him, one even calling him a 'bully'\\". That led to Cozens transferring to Chaparral High School. Due to his transfer, Cozens was forced to sit out the rest of his junior season due to eligibility restrictions. As a senior, Cozens posted a .520 batting average, and hit 19 home runs, in 33 games, breaking the school's single-season record, formerly held by longtime Chicago White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko. His 19 home runs led the state and were second nationally only to the 21 hit by future major leaguer Joey Gallo. He ended the season by hitting a walk-off home run in the bottom of the seventh inning of the Division I state championship, winning the title. He played that season alongside future Team Israel outfielder/first baseman Jeremy Wolf. Cozens' also was a standout defensive end on Chaparral's football team and verbally committed to play for the Arizona Wildcats football team before opting to sign with the Phillies. Career =Philadelphia Phillies= As a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies, Marti Wolever, among other representatives of the organization, evaluated Cozens before the 2012 MLB draft and watched him during a workout at Citizens Bank Park. Though there were some concerns about Cozens‚Äô temperament, the Phillies selected him in the second round with the 77th overall selection of the draft, and he signed a contract with a $659,800 signing bonus. \\"That was probably the guy I was most excited about\\", said Phillies general manager Rub√©n Amaro Jr., \\"Extraordinary power for a kid -- great body, runs well, seems to move pretty well\\". Cozens began the season with the Gulf Coast Phillies of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. In 50 games, he batted .255 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in (RBIs). The Phillies promoted Cozens to the Williamsport Crosscutters of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League the following year. He finished the season second in the league in doubles (19), extra base hits (30), and runs (50) while also ranking third in slugging percentage (.469). Cozens struck out 147 times in his first full season of professional baseball for the Lakewood BlueClaws of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 2015, he shared time with the Blueclaws and the Reading Fightin' Phils of the Class AA Eastern League. During the Fightin Phils' season, Cozens hit 40 home runs, the most by any Eastern Leaguer since Ron Kittle in , topping the team's single-season record set by Darin Ruf four years prior, and earning him the Joe Bauman Home Run Award for the most home runs on the season by a minor leaguer; he led the league in runs scored (106), extra-base hits (81), total bases (308), doubles (38), RBIs (125) and slugging percentage (.591).

Career Prior to entering the practice of law, Lindner was a member of the startup team and was software development manager for the computer game company Legend Entertainment, and worked as a designer, programmer, implementer, music composer and/or engineer of computer games produced by the company such as Spellcasting series, Gateway series, Companions of Xanth, Star Control 3, and Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, among other game titles. Despite success in producing games, Lindner switched careers and launched his own law firm in Fairfax in 2001, focusing primarily on criminal and traffic litigation. As a criminal defense attorney, he handled difficult cases such as homicide trials and representation of persons wrongly held in custody. He served as a substitute judge from 2010 to 2015 and presided over causes in General District and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District courts throughout Northern Virginia. He helped reinvigorate, and from 2012 to 2015, was Co-Chair of the Fairfax Bar Criminal Law Practice Section, serving for the first year in collaboration with David Bernhard. As a Judge, he has pioneered and promoted implementation of the model Veterans Treatment Docket program, and presided over its first graduates. The program takes a novel hybrid approach, integrating the resolution of criminal cases for criminally-involved veterans with mental health and substance abuse treatment and veteran mentorship. The program has not been without controversy, initially struggling to gain legislative support in the Virginia General Assembly. However, the Supreme Court of Virginia enacted a rule regularizing the existence of such specialty dockets. Lindner's accomplishments both in private practice and as a judge, and perseverance in nurturing the Veterans Treatment Docket, resulted in him being named a \\"Leader in the Law\\" by Virginia Lawyers Weekly in 2016.

It is most famous for coining the word \\"cyberpunk\\",Cyberpunk Women, Feminism and Science Fiction: A Critical Study which came to be used to describe the media subgenre centered on rebellious use of technology under the science fiction archetype. History In the spring of 1980, Bethke was writing a story about children who lived immersed in a truly technological society, with their own culture, disparate from mainstream society as it appeared at that time. He describes the process as: The story was printed three years later in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, itself the first magazine to focus solely on science fiction. The story's impact was large enough, that after William Gibson's novel Neuromancer was released a year later, the term began referring to the genre it tied together as \\"cyberpunk\\", in part because of its repeated use by Gardner Dozois in print, initially in a Washington Post article called \\"Science Fiction in the Eighties.\\"The Early Life of the Word ‚ÄúCyberpunk‚Äù Plot summary Through heavy use of the literary technique of indirect exposition‚Äîknown in the science fiction world as \\"incluing\\", where it originated with Robert Heinlein‚Äîthe reader learns that the character \\"Mikey\\" is a proficient and troublemaking computer virtuoso, essentially a \\"hacker\\", though this term is not used in the story. He hangs out with friends who cause trouble online, encounters interference from his parents, and uses his skills to circumvent their will. In the novelized version, which incorporates a number of sequel short stories, this goes through a number of different phases. Novel Cyberpunk was originally written as a series of short stories in the 1980s. \\"Cyberpunk ‚Äì a short story by Bruce Bethke\\" Bethke says \\"After I sold the original story in '82, I continued to work on the story cycle, publishing bits and pieces here and there throughout the 1980's. In '89 I pulled the major chunks together into the rough form of a novel, and to my surprise and delight I sold it, to a publisher who later regained his sanity and decided not to release it.\\" This novel was purchased by a publisher via an exclusive contract that forbade Bethke to sell the novel to another publisher. However, the publisher decided not to release the novel, causing several years of legal battles over the rights to the book. Bethke has a downloadable version of the novel available for five dollars (shareware) on his website.Cyberpunk, by Bruce Bethke When asked, during a 2005 interview, by Lynne Jamneck in Strange Horizons, for the reason his publisher purchased the book but never printed it, Bethke replied that it was because he had refused to change the ending: Bethke said that he refused because this end scene would have taken place in a school. He concluded that the book might indeed have sold better that way, but \\"sales aren't everything\\".

It is a silent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), in contrast to the related antiprogestogen mifepristone (which is a weak partial agonist of the receptor). Moreover, compared to mifepristone, onapristone has reduced antiglucocorticoid activity, shows little antiandrogenic activity, and has 10- to 30-fold greater potency as an antiprogestogen. The medication was under development for clinical use, for instance in the treatment of breast cancer and as an endometrial contraceptive, but was discontinued during phase III clinical trials in 1995 due to findings that liver function abnormalities developed in a majority patients. Onapristone has been found to be effective in the treatment of breast cancer. As of 2016, onapristone has re-emerged and is under development for the treatment of prostate cancer, currently in phase II clinical trials. It was also under development for the treatment of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer, but was discontinued for these indications in favor of focusing on prostate cancer.

On the same day, they meet with an accident where Leimahan's son is severely injured and is hospitalised. Leimahan comes to Tampha's place and warns Tampha's step-mother to not let Tampha try to meet his son and forget about him. During this time, Tampha's step-mother plans for Tampha's marriage to a Meitei guy (Mangoljao) living in Assam, who recently got divorced from his first wife. Tampha's step-mother also comes to know about Tampha's pregnancy and repeatedly asks her to abort the child before marriage, to which Tampha denies. She tries meeting Leimahan's son but was not allowed. She writes a message to Leimahan's son informing him about what all is happening, but he happens to read the message only when he was discharged from the hospital.

As soon as Tampha give birth to a baby boy, she is thrown out of the house. In Manipur, at this time, Tampha's father passed away. Since then, Tampha starts working in random places in Assam, joins as worker in house-building and stays at a place where the other female Assamese workers are staying, with her child. One night, after coming back from work, some Assamese guys tries to kidnap her, to which she fights and run, finding shelter in some stranger's house. The stranger also tries to rape her, to which she runs out of the place and ends up sleeping under a tree, near some railway track. Next morning, she returns to the place where she was staying.

Tampha is settled at this time in a village of Manipur, where she stays with his son at some old guy's house. Apparently, the old guy plans to sell his house and live at his married daughter's place since he is getting old and has no one to take care of him. So, Tampha and her son move to Imphal.

He has served as creative director on several of Arkane's titles, including co-creator with Harvey Smith for the Dishonored series. Career When Colantonio was about 18 years old, at the verge of having to perform mandatory military service that France had at the time, he participated in a contest held by Electronic Arts (EA) on knowledge about the Ultima series, which he had been a fan of. He was unaware that the contest was meant for EA to find qualified applicants for a new studio they were setting up in France, and through the contest, Colantonio was hired into EA, helping with establishing their customer support services in France. =Arkane Studios= With the introduction of home video game consoles, Colantonio saw a shift in EA to more sports-oriented games, an area he was not interested in, and left, taking a position at Infogrames for a short time. He decided around 1999 that he wanted to start his own studio, and with funding support from his uncle, he and three of his friends founded Arkane Studios in Lyon, France. In June 2017, he departed Arkane, though he stayed with the Lyon branch of Arkane to help with transition to new management, while Harvey Smith oversaw the Austin studio. Colantonio stated that he wanted to spend more time with his son and re-evaluate his goals for the future. In a 2020 interview, he said that part of his reason for leaving was \\"creative anxiety\\" around delivering a triple A quality game where it felt like more like making a product instead, as well as wanting to take a break to focus on other matters. =WolfEye Studios= Colantonio and Julien Roby, a former producer at Arkane, announced in November 2019 they had earlier formed a new studio, WolfEye Studios, a twenty-person studio working distributively. They announced their first game, Weird West, at The Game Awards 2019, to be published by Devolver Digital. Weird West will be a top-down action role- playing game with elements of the immersive sim genre in which the player takes the role of heroes in the American frontier which encounters supernatural elements, with randomized elements through each playthrough. The game is based on the Weird West genre it borrows its title from.

Early life and career Sayegh was of Assyrian origin, born in Lebanon 11 kilometres from Bethlehem on 7 March 1884. Sayegh's father Callil emigrated with his family from Lebanon to Sydney, Australia in 1888. The Sayegh family later moved to New Zealand in 1894 arriving in Wellington before finally settling in Auckland. Callil Sayegh set up business as owner operator of a restaurant which Joe was to take over on his fathers retirement. Situated on Auckland's Queen Street, opposite to the Civic Theatre, Sayegh's establishment specialized in serving tea and confectionary. He later became the President of the Auckland Retail Confectioners' Association. He never married. Political career Sayegh was a member of the Labour Party and successfully stood for the Auckland City Council in 1933. He later stood as the Labour Party's candidate for Mayor of Auckland in 1935, 1938 and 1941. In 1935 Sayegh was subject of a selection controversy when selected over prominent local lawyer and MP Rex Mason with the blessing of Auckland Labour Representation Committee executive Fred Young. Sayegh was viewed a respectable individual and competent city councillor, but most gave him little chance of beating Citizens candidate Ernest Davis. As Young had been employed by Davis for many years, John A. Lee and several Labour MPs alleged that Young had been bribed by Davis to ensure the selection of a weak Labour candidate for the Mayoralty which caused a rift in the Auckland Labour Party. Sayegh's campaign was not helped due to continued interference by Lee who tried to discredit him, calling him a \\"dumb wop fellow who could not even speak English\\". Regardless, Sayegh polled extremely well in the election, losing to Davis by only 363 votes. Despite losing the Mayoralty Sayegh was easily re-elected to the council, topping the poll with more votes than any other candidate. Three years later Sayegh's share of the vote fell when he was again defeated by Davis. Sayegh stood for the Mayoralty a third time in 1941 but was beaten by Citizens & Ratepayers nominee John Allum. Sayegh was himself President of the Auckland Labour Representation Committee by 1940 and played a part in the expulsion of Lee from the Labour Party in 1940. Later that year, he stood for the Labour nomination at the Auckland West by-election following the death of Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage, but lost to Peter Carr. Following this he was selected by the Labour Party to contest the electorate against Lee in the scheduled 1941 general election. However, the 1941 election was postponed until 1943 due to World War II. Sayegh ultimately did not stand in the election. Later life and death By 1944 Sayegh had largely retired from public life. He had closed his Queen Street store and had taken up a position as the Chairman of Directors at the Robinson Ice Cream Company. He declined to stand for Mayor a fourth time and also retired from the Auckland City Council, Transport Board and Harbour Board, standing only for the Hospital Board and Power Board. He became chairman of Labour's branch. Sayegh died whilst staying in an Dunedin hotel on 29 March 1946. He had been in Invercargill to attend a conference of justices of the peace and was on his way back to Auckland when he died. He was buried at Hillsborough Cemetery, Auckland. At the time of his death he had been nominated as a candidate for the Auckland Electric Power Board by the Labour Party for a by-election.

Their name is a reference to the terrorist group in Luis Bu√±uel's final film, That Obscure Object of Desire. The group's music is a blend of folk and sacred music, industrial and ambient sounds, and samples that has drawn comparisons to neofolk artists like Current 93 and Death in June, as well as artists including Dead Can Dance, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Henryk G√≥recki, and Arvo P√§rt. The group incorporates Christian imagery and symbolism into their music, and specifically draws inspiration from the Eastern Church, especially its use of icons. In concert, the group incorporates multimedia and film clips from directors like Andrei Tarkovsky into their performances, as well as ritual movements and field recordings. The group's first two albums -- The Gift of Tears (1987) and Mirror (1990) -- were released on the Probe Plus label, as were two EPs, La Liturgie Pour La Fin Du Temps (1994) and Paradis (1995). After a long hiatus, the group's recordings were reissued in 2013 in a collection titled After The End, which was released by the French label Infrastition. The band then released a new album titled Beauty Will Save The World in 2015 on Occultation Recordings. The Gift of Tears and Mirror have also been reissued, in 2015 and 2017, respectively. A new album, Songs of Yearning is due for release on Occultation Recordings in June 2020, along with a second, limited edition, album entitled Nocturnes.

A fan of jazz from a young age, Barkan ran the club despite its inability to break even, and financial troubles resulted in its closure in 1983. Barkan then relocated to New York City, where he became the manager of the Boys Club of Harlem; around 1990 he returned to the Bay Area to manage the club Yoshi's in Oakland. He quit Yoshi's in 1993 and worked as a record producer for the rest of the decade, with labels such as Fantasy, Milestone, HighNote, Columbia, Sunnyside, and Concord, as well as many Japanese labels. In 2000, Barkan was hired to take Joel Dorn's place as head of the jazz label 32 Records. In 2001 he began working as the director of Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola at Jazz at Lincoln Center, a position he held until 2012.

Bronzeville is an original play written by Tim Toyama and Aaron Woolfolk. It was developed and produced by the Robey Theatre Company. The original production and two subsequent revivals were directed by Ben Guillory. The play had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in Los Angeles, California on April 17, 2009 and enjoyed an extended, sold-out run. Woolfolk and Toyama were subsequently nominated for an Ovation Award, and they and Guillory were nominated for NAACP Theatre Awards. The play is named after the nickname given to the Little Tokyo, Los Angeles neighborhood from 1942 to 1945 when Japanese Americans were taken from their homes and put into internment camps. During that time, many African Americans migrating to California from the southern United States settled in Little Tokyo, which became known as Bronzeville. The play is about an African American family from Mississippi that moves to Los Angeles. When they find a Japanese American man hiding in the attic, the family must confront their own values as they struggle to both protect themselves and do what is right. The timeline of the play runs from the spring of 1942 to the spring of 1945. Bronzeville had its first revival as an abridged version in May, 2011 at the Manzanar National Historic Site in Independence, California. It was produced by The Robey Theatre Company in association with Manzanar National Historic Site and Inyo Council for the Arts. A second revival production, this time of the full play, was produced by The Robey Theatre Company in association with the Latino Theater Company and Kathie Foley Meyer and was staged at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in June and July 2013 as part of the Project Bronzeville festival. On March 28, 2014, a staged reading of the play was presented by The Lorraine Hansberry Theatre in San Francisco, California.  Plot  As Japanese Americans in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Little Tokyo are loaded onto buses that will take them to various internment camps, Hide \\"Henry\\" Tahara lets camera shop proprietor Sam Teraoka in on a secret: He plans to hide in his home. Citing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Henry says the rounding up of Japanese Americans is illegal, and he refuses to go along with it. Sam wishes Henry luck. Several weeks later, the Goodwin Family -- Mama Janie, her oldest grandson Jodie, Jodie's wife Alice, their daughter Princess, and Jodie's younger brother Felix -- enters their new house, having just arrived in Los Angeles from Mississippi. While the women talk of exploring the neighborhood, Jodie argues with his brother over whether Felix should get a 9 to 5 job or find a jazz club to perform in. Just then a weak and hungry Henry comes down the stairs, surprising the Goodwins. Jodie quickly subdues him. Under questioning, Henry explains that this is his family's home and that he has been hiding in the attic. He becomes upset when he learns the house was illegally rented out. Jodie expresses concern that the family could suffer dire consequences if they are discovered harboring someone who should be in government custody. He demands Henry come to the police station with him, until Mama Janie reminds the family how, as a child during slavery, she witnessed her uncle's brutal execution after he was caught trying to escape to freedom. Over Jodie's objections the family agrees to protect Henry. The Goodwins and Henry quickly warm to each other. Moreover, Henry and Princess develop a strong mutual attraction. It also becomes clear that some tensions have accompanied the family from Mississippi. In particular, Jodie is upset that Felix refuses to join the first group of African Americans being trained for the United States Marine Corps in North Carolina. Felix quickly finds work playing saxophone at the Sahara, a newly opened jazz club in the neighborhood. When he learns the owner, Tubby, needs a photographer to help promote the club, he remembers some of Henry's photos that he saw and recommends his \\"Chinese friend\\" for the job. Using an old Time Magazine article on how to tell the difference between Japanese and Chinese, Felix coaches Henry to act like the latter so he can work at the Sahara. Princess goes with Henry on a fun excursion to Chinatown to test his new \\"Chinese\\" mannerisms. After they return, Alice takes Princess aside and says she and Jodie have noticed the budding romance with Henry, and orders Princess to put an end to it. Overhearing the conversation, Mama Janie invites Princess to help her in the garden, then encourages her great-granddaughter to live her life the way she sees fit. A few nights later at the Sahara, Felix plays with the band while Henry takes photographs. Princess comes and quickly gains the attention of several men, but she ignores them and flirts with Henry. When they start dancing together, Henry is attacked, causing Felix to leave the stage to defend him. A huge brawl ensues. Back at the house, Jodie and Alice scold Princess and Felix for her being at the club. Jodie also admonishes Henry for causing the fight, especially when Henry is supposed to be in hiding. Jodie tells Alice he's decided to turn Henry in before the authorities discovers the family is hiding him. After getting resistance from Alice, Jodie goes to a bar to consider what to do. The bartender, Hamp, talks about the changing neighborhood, then tells Jodie how everyone is talking about a brawl that started at the Sahara \\"over an Oriental man being sweet on a colored woman.\\" Fearing his family's secret will be exposed, Jodie goes to the police station and tells them about Henry. Later that night, the police and FBI come to the house and take Henry away. In federal detention, Henry undergoes days of intense interrogation that nearly breaks him. A kind FBI agent, Larry, offers Henry a way out: enlistment in a new unit of Japanese American soldiers that will fight in the war. Henri reluctantly agrees and joins the 442nd Infantry Regiment. As he sees action in Europe, Henry writes letters to the Goodwins detailing his exploits. Princess writes several letters back, updating Henry about life in the neighborhood. A telegram later arrives from the War Department, addressed to Henry's father: Henry has been killed in action. The news devastates the Goodwins, and Princess accuses Jodie of being responsible for his death. As Japanese Americans fill the streets after the end of internment, the Goodwins pack in preparation for their move to the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles. Henry's father Naoma, a neighborhood leader who was taken away by federal authorities the night of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, comes to meet the family. He thanks them for sheltering Henry and showing him love and kindness. The family joins Naoma in reciting a Buddhist prayer for Henry's soul.  History of the Play  Tim Toyama had already shown an interest in the interaction between Japanese Americans and African Americans with his play Yuri and Malcolm, about the friendship between Japanese American Civil Rights activist Yuri Kochiyama and Civil Rights icon and Black Nationalist leader Malcolm X. When he learned from a friend about Little Tokyo's Bronzeville period, he felt it provided a wonderful subject for a play. Coincidentally, at around the same time Aaron Woolfolk helped to paint the Little Tokyo Mural as a volunteer activity with his Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme alumni group, the JET Alumni Association of Southern California. Curious about an image on the mural depicting jazz legend Charlie Parker, Woolfolk was told about the neighborhood's Bronzeville period and how Parker had been one of its residents. Woolfolk wrote down the basic information with plans to someday explore writing a screenplay on the subject. In 2007 Toyama approached Robey Theatre Company artistic director Ben Guillory and told him he wanted to do a play about Little Tokyo‚Äôs Bronzeville period in a way that intertwined the Japanese American and African American experiences. Guillory was enthusiastic about the idea, and said he would like to see such a play as a Robey Theatre Company production. Toyama said he felt he needed to create, develop, and write the play with an African American writer, and asked Guillory if he could recommend anyone. Guillory told him he had the ideal person in mind: Woolfolk, who at the time was developing his feature film The Harimaya Bridge -- about an African American man in Japan -- with Guillory cast in the lead role. Guillory introduced Toyama and Woolfolk, and they agreed to move forward on the project together. Over the next two years Toyama and Woolfolk came up with the plot and characters, developed the story, and wrote the play under Guillory's tutelage. Both writers drew heavily on their personal experiences when creating the plot and characters. Toyama was inspired by a friend who had known of an instance in which an African American family had hidden a Japanese American man during internment in the 1940s. He also called on his upbringing and experiences as a member of the Japanese American community, including having several close relatives and friends who were in internment camps. Woolfolk drew on his lifelong friendships with Japanese Americans, his experiences living and working in Japan, family stories of black migration from the Deep South to California in the 1940s, the murder of a Japanese friend in New York City and his subsequent visit to see her parents in Japan, a longtime interest in the Montford Point Marines, and his love of jazz music. Toyama and Woolfolk also did a lot of research, viewing old documents from the era and interviewing experts on Little Tokyo and its Bronzeville period. Some of the Robey Theatre Company's early marketing materials erroneously stated that the play was based on a true story. This resulted from a misunderstanding, as the plot, situations, and characters were entirely created by Woolfolk and Toyama. In 2008 Toyama entered the play into the East West Players David Henry Hwang Writer‚Äôs Institute, under which he and Woolfolk further developed the play and where it was performed for the first time in a staged reading. Bronzeville premiered on April 17, 2009 as a Robey Theatre Company production at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. It enjoyed a sold-out run and was extended by two weeks.  Reception  Bronzeville received rave reviews, with Toyama and Woolfolk getting praise for the story, characterizations, and dialogue; and Guillory drawing raves for his innovative staging. The cast was also heralded for its performances. Upon its premiere the play made the Los Angeles Times Critics Choice list. The 2013 revival also garnered strong critical notices. The LA Stage Times called it \\"a revelation\\" and described it as having \\"a fine- grained consistency\\" that \\"packs a powerful punch.\\"  Awards Recognition  Woolfolk and Toyama were nominated for an Ovation Award in the category Best Playwrighting for an Original Play. Bronzeville was also nominated for four NAACP Theater Awards: Toyama and Woolfolk for Best Playwright, Guillory for Best Director, the cast for Best Ensemble Cast, and Luke Moyer for Best Lighting, for which he won.

Little, Brown) The Wrong Side Of Goodbye is the 29th novel by American crime author Michael Connelly, and the nineteenth novel featuring Los Angeles Police Department detective Harry Bosch. It was published in 2016. Plot summary This novel finds semi-retired Harry Bosch alternating between two investigations. As a private detective he is summoned by billionaire industrialist Whitney Vance. The elderly, never-married Vance wants Bosch to track down an old girlfriend to know if he has an heir to whom he can leave his fortune. As a volunteer part-time officer for San Fernando, Bosch is involved in the search for a serial rapist. In college, 18 year old Vance had an eight-month romance with 16 year old Vibiana Duarte. Their respective families objected to the couple: Duarte's father disliked that Vance was not Catholic, while Vance's eugenicist father disapproved of his son dating a Mexican. She may have been pregnant when they last saw each other in 1950. Bosch investigates under an order of confidentiality and finds Vance actually had a son, Dominick Santanello, born shortly before his mother's suicide and adopted soon after birth. Santanello was killed in action during the Vietnam War, so Bosch has to inquire further. He discovers Dominick had a daughter who is named Vibiana Veracruz after her grandmother. Vibiana Veracruz is alive and active as an artist and a sculptor. Bosch receives, in the mail, a will hand-written by Vance giving $10 million to his longtime personal assistant and secretary Ida Forsythe and the remainder of his estate to his heir and also names Bosch as the executor. Bosch hires his half-brother Mickey Haller to represent him. When Vance is found dead at his desk investigators first believed he died of natural causes but days later inform Bosch that the elderly man was murdered. Noting inconsistencies in the case, Bosch eventually discovers a fraud initiated by Ida Forsythe when she believed Vance was dying. She confesses having killed Vance when he recovered from a short illness, to avoid his discovery of her chicanery. Vibiana Veracruz uses her inheritance from Vance to buy out developers who wanted to rezone her neighborhood so that the neighborhood can remain as an Arts District. The parallel crimes Harry is investigating were perpetrated by a serial rapist who they have code-named Screen Cutter after his method of entry to victims' homes. Investigation reveals all the victims lived in neighborhoods frequented by a city code officer, leading Bosch to suspect Dockweiler, a former San Fernando police officer known for his misogynistic attitudes. In an earlier force reduction Officer Dockweiler had been transferred to city code enforcement. Bosch shoots and wounds Dockweiler, who had taken the police chief and the police captain as hostages. Bosch then has to find and rescue his partner Bella Lourdes, whom Dockweiler had abducted and imprisoned when she too came to suspecting him as the Screen Cutter.

Salts and esters of tetrolic acid are known as tetrolates.  History  The first reported synthesis of tetrolic acid is believed to be by German chemist Johann Georg Anton Geuther in 1871 as part of his work investigating the derivatives of ethyl acetoacetate.  Production  Tetrolic acid is manufacturedSmith, W. (1973) \\"Preparation of tetrolic acid\\" on a commercial scale by treatment of propyne with a strong base (to form an acetylide), followed by carbon dioxide: 500px Strong bases such as n-BuLi and NaNH2 can be used.  Properties  Tetrolic acid is highly soluble in polar solvents (water, ethanol) and may be recrystallized from non polar solvents (such as heptane, toluene). The compound is a white crystalline solid which can exist in two polymorphous crystalline forms. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectrum in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide shows a characteristic singlet peak at 1.99 ppm corresponding to the -CH3 protons. Tetrolic acid sublimes at temperatures above 20¬∞C, and should ideally be stored in a sealed container in a refrigerator.  Safety  Tetrolic acid is thermally unstable at high temperatures. Testing using accelerated rate calorimetry (ARC) showed exothermic onset from 135 ¬∞C, precluding short-path distillation as a means of purification.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. The station is located in the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and belongs to fare zone 575. Since 2001, the station has also been part of the area where the fares of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) are accepted at a transitional rate. The address of the station is Germersheimer Stra√üe 14. Its former entrance building is under heritage protection. It is located on the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway and was opened on 25 July 1876 with the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of that railway. It is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Since late 2010 it has been part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn.  Location The station is located in the suburb of Sondernheim.  History = Railway initiatives around Sondernheim= Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction from Rheinschanze via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg, which would compete with the Mannheim‚ÄìBasel railway proposed by Baden. However, instead it was decided to build the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was opened in the period from 1847 to 1849. In the meantime, discussions took place as to whether a line from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or a line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth was more urgent and desirable. Since the military preferred a route on the edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald), this was built in the form of the Maximilian Railway between Neustadt and Wissembourg. In 1863 and 1864, a local committee from R√ºlzheim and other surrounding communities, campaigned to extend the line ending in Germersheim to W√∂rth, which was followed shortly afterwards by its first plan, which showed a route that ran via Sondernheim, among other places. Subsequently, Sondernheim station was opened on 25 June 1876. Sondernheim station (below right) from a postcard of 1910 = Further development = The station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 May 1936. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. In the meantime the station had been downgraded to a halt. The station became part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn in 2010. This was followed by the renewal of the platform. Entrance building Entrance building The former entrance building was built around 1870 in the neoclassical style out of brick. It was built in the period when the station was opened and is under heritage protection. It is no longer used for railway operations; instead, it houses a local youth club. Operations The station is served at 30-minute intervals. Lines S 51 and S 52 of Karlsruhe Stadtbahn run once an hour, beginning in Germersheim station and running to the Karlsruhe inner city. The former follows the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway until shortly before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, where it runs over the ramp to the Albtalbahnhof to connect with the tram network. The S 52 leaves the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway east of Maxau, then runs over tram lines through the Karlsruhe district of Knielingen and from there to the inner city. Freight operations at the station have been abandoned.

When it was shut down in February 2015, the site had over 215,000 users and hosted 23,000 sexually explicit images and videos of children as young as toddlers. The shutdown operation, called Operation Pacifier, involved the FBI hijacking the site and continuing to serve content for two weeks. During this time the FBI used a malware-based \\"Network Investigative Technique\\" to hack into the web browsers of users accessing the site, thereby revealing their identities. The operation led to the arrest of 900 site users and three prison sentences. While the FBI claimed to have knowledge about the existence of the website right from its beginning, it was unable to track down the servers locations or the site owner. The reason for their struggle was the fact that Playpen was hosted as a Hidden service via Tor. Only a mishap of the site owner revealing his IP address finally allowed the law enforcement to track down both page and personnel. The investigation led to the following sentences in May 2017: Steven Chase, a 57-year-old from Florida who created the website: 30 years in prison. His two co-defendants pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 20 years each earlier in 2017 for their involvement in Playpen. The investigation was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation because, after having taken control of the website, the FBI continued for nearly two weeks to operate the website and thus distribute child pornography, i.e. exactly the same crime the bureau sought to stop. The lawyer of a defendant in the case stated that the FBI not only operated the website, but improved it so its number of visitors rose sharply while it was under their control. Nevertheless, there are other voices, like Steven Wilson, Head of the European Cybercrime Centre, who defend the actions taken as they would represent a modern response to a modern problem. In 2017, charges were dropped against one member of the site, after the court demanded that details of the hacking tool be released. The FBI preferred to keep the NIT (network investigative technique) malware a secret for future investigations.http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/FBI-Special- ed-teacher-caught-with-infant-rape-6384373.php Challenges were raised about the FBI's possibly severe misuse of the initial search warrant, leading to the likely dismissal of much of the gathered evidence against one defendant.http://www.startribune.com/a-massive-fbi-child-porn-probe-has- lawyers-asking-does-the-end-justify-the- means/423176653/https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/06/08/it-is-not-ok-to- break-the-law-to-catch-criminals-judge-rules/ On August 28, 2019, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the warrant was invalid but that the evidence obtained was not required to be excluded due to the good-faith exception doctrine.

Kaikhosro III Gurieli (; died ) was a member of the Georgian family of Gurieli, a princely dynasty of Guria. He was briefly Prince-regnant of Guria as a rival to his brother Giorgi IV Gurieli in 1716. In 1724, he emigrated to the Russian Empire, where he commanded the Georgian Hussar Regiment in the 1740s. Kaikhosro was the second son of Mamia III Gurieli, Prince of Guria, and Elene, daughter of Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze. He was a monk in 1716, when Elene engineered a coup against his own son, Giorgi IV Gurieli, whom she deposed with the help of Mingrelian and Imeretian troops and installed Kaikhosro as prince of Guria. Next year, Giorgi was able to resume his rule with the help of Ottoman pasha of Erzurum; Elene and Kaikhosro fled to Kartli under the protection of King Vakhtang VI, whose mother Tuta was Kaikhosro's grandfather's sister. In 1724, Kaikhosro and his wife followed Vakhtang VI in his exile into Russia occasioned by the Ottoman invasion of Kartli. Known in Russia as Kaikhosro Matveyevich Gurielov, he was enlisted in the Georgian Hussar Regiment in 1738 and granted an estate in the Poltava Governorate. In 1741, he was promoted to the rank of podpolkovnik and placed in command of the Georgian Hussar Regiment. He retired in 1751. Kaikhosro's Russia-born son Stepan (1730‚Äì1812) and grandson Ivan (1770‚Äì1818) were major-generals of the Imperial Russian Army. With Ivan's death, the Gurieli's Russian branch went extinct in a male line; Kaikhosro's female-line descendants sought the right to carry the surname of Gurieli into their families in the 19th century, but to no avail.

Life The Kastamonites family probably hailed from Kastamon in Paphlagonia, and had emerged in the late 11th century as one of the Byzantine Empire's aristocratic clans, its members holding various civil and military offices under the Komnenian emperors. Theodore was the brother of Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa, wife of Andronikos Doukas Angelos and mother of the emperors Isaac II Angelos () and Alexios III Angelos (). When Isaac II ascended the throne, he was unable to rely on the support of the restive and ambitious noble families, and turned to the bureaucracy for support. Immediately after his accession, Isaac II placed his uncle in charge of the financial administration. Although suffering from gout so that he had to be carried about in a litter, according to his contemporary Niketas Choniates, Kastamonites was a capable official, particularly in taxation matters‚Äîthe Pisan and Genoese merchants in particular complained that he always exacted full customs duties from them‚Äîand an eloquent speaker. As a result, Isaac soon promoted him to logothetes ton sekreton, putting him in charge of supervising all the civilian departments. Indeed, Kastamonites became the de facto ruler of the empire, as he handled all government affairs, and his nephew always acceded to his requests. Officials and nobles alike had to stand in his presence and show him deference. His position was so exalted that Isaac allowed him to use imperial attributes, such as the purple military cloak and a purple saddle cover, or signing with the special purple ink reserved for the emperor. He was the first official to be called megas logothetes (\\"Grand Logothete\\"), in a chrysobull granted to the Genoese by Isaac II in 1192, a title which soon replaced that of logothetes ton sekreton. Nevertheless, on 15 August 1193, during the procession of the Dormition of the Theotokos, Kastamonites was hailed by the crowd as lord and emperor; hearing that, he was stricken by apoplexy, and although he briefly recovered, he died a few days later. He was succeeded as chief minister of the Empire by Constantine Mesopotamites.

He was a good organiser and volunteered large amounts of his time to causes he believed in. Personal life Memorial stone on R√πm Butterfield was born in Farnhill, North Yorkshire on 8 August 1936 and from his youth he was a keen walker. He worked at the local gasworks and then in the Post Office. In 1957 he moved to London to start his lifetime career with HM Customs and Excise, in 1960 transferring to its whisky departments in Perth, Dundee and then Inverness. reported in It was here that he developed his love for the Scottish hills. Butterfield was a burly man, not built with the physique for climbing, who never claimed to be more than a hillwalker. He admitted that to climb the Inaccessible Pinnacle \\"a climbing friend from Manchester hauled me up it\\". Butterfield died in Dundee on 12 May 2009, survived by Moira Gillespie, his partner. His ashes were scattered at Loch Clair, just east of Upper Loch Torridon at a place looking towards Liathach, a favourite view for Butterfield; and at Kinloch, near the Dibidil bothy, a simple memorial stone was erected with a quote from William Blake \\"Great things are done when men and mountains meet; This is not done by jostling in the street.\\" Scottish hillwalking books and environmentalism Schiehallion When in Perth he started climbing the Scottish mountains and became particularly attracted to Schiehallion. An interest in improving bothies, remote highland shelters, led to him becoming secretary of the Mountain Bothies Association from 1969 to 1972. In 1972 he published a book about a project for repairing Dibidil bothy on the island of R√πm, and in 1979 he produced a detailed report A Survey of Shelters in Remote Mountain areas of the Scottish Highlands (1979). In 1970 Butterfield co-founded the Mountaineering Council of Scotland where he was willing to spend time stuffing magazines into envelopes to post to members and working as a volunteer in the office generally. He gave fund-raising talks and wrote, without payment, articles illustrated with his own photographs to be included in the club magazine. He was in favour of a specifically Scottish organisation, one intended to help individual hill-walkers and not just the established mountaineering clubs. Butterfield was never a single-minded \\"Munro bagger\\" but nevertheless by 1971 he had climbed all the Munros and eventually in 1986 he published The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland describing all the hills over in both countries, described by Mountaineering Scotland as \\"the bible for hill goers for Munro style hills\\" and which sold over 50,000 copies. A substantial book of over 300 pages, this was an early example of the genre of magnificently illustrated hillwalking books with maps and details of routes, transport and accommodation. For many readers it proved to be an encouragement to explore remote areas of Britain, particularly Scotland. Butterfield was a founder member of the John Muir Trust, set up in 1983, and by the time it purchased the mountain Schiehallion in 1998 he was a trustee and gave the royalties of his 1999 book The Magic of the Munros towards the cost. He followed this in 2000 with The Call of the Corbetts (a Corbett is a mountain over ) and both books became best-sellers. He was a co-founder and first president of the Munro Society and was a part of the successful campaign to extend the Cairngorms National Park further into Perthshire. He became a director of the John Muir Trust and was the fourth person to be given its Lifetime Achievement Award, after Tom Weir, Adam Watson and Doug Scott.

The campaign led to the signing of the Treaty of Rastatt (1714).  Prelude  On 11 April 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed between most participants in the War of the Spanish Succession: Spain and France against Great Britain, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic. The Habsburg Monarchy and the Holy Roman Empire refused to sign the treaty and so remained at war against France.  Campaign  By 1713, both France and the Holy Roman Empire were militarily depleted, but France was able to raise the largest army, with 300 squadrons and 240 battalions. Command of the army was given to Marshal Villars, the most successful French army commander of the war. Eugene of Savoy moved all of his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to the upper Rhine to co+operate with the armies of the other German states. Now that the subsidies of the Maritime powers had ceased, the armies of the Holy Roman Empire were very much below strength. The combined army of Eugene of Savoy had only 115 squadrons and 85 battalions, more or less one third of the strength of the French army. The French army crossed the Rhine in June and the Marquis de Bezons started to besiege Landau on June 24. The city, defended by Charles Alexander, Prince of W√ºrttemberg, held out until August 26 before it surrendered. In the meantime, Arthur Dillon had also taken Kaiserslautern. Villars then advanced to besiege Freiburg on September 20. The city surrendered on October 15 and the castle on November 17. Eugene of Savoy could not risk battle and was reduce to the role of passive spectator. Louis XIV now asked to open negotiations and was accepted by the Holy Roman Empire. Marshal Villars and Prince Eugene of Savoy met in the city of Rastatt in Baden-Baden and started a series of complex negotiations which lasted until 7 March 1714, when the Treaty of Rastatt was signed.

They are all characters which have appeared in The Beginning (2015), The Conclusion (2017), The Lost Legends (2017) and the novel The Rise of Sivagami (2017). Film series characters The following characters are introduced in the films Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017). = Protagonists = Amarendra Baahubali Amarendra Baahubali, Maharaja Vikramdeva's son, was born in Mahishmati(Maghizhmathi). His mother (then Queen) died while giving birth to him. He was named \\"Baahubali\\" by his mother, Rajamatha Sivagami, who later became his mother. She recognised his leadership qualities and announced him as the next king after he succeeded in a contest to defend the empire from Kalakeya invasion. Though Bhallala Deva killed the Kalakeya king Inkoshi, Baahubali was announced the next king as he showed more honour in the battle. He is envied by Bhallaladeva who manipulates Sivagami who in turn issues an order to Kattappa to execute Baahubali for treason. He is loyal and bound by his promise even at the cost of his throne. He is the father of Mahendra Baahubali alias Sivudu. He was stabbed in the back by Kattappa. He was married to Devasena. He is a skilled warrior with both his sword and the arrows. He can shoot more than one arrow in a single string. He has good battle strategy skills, which proved useful in the battle against the Pindari tribe. Mahendra Baahubali Mahendra Bahubali was born in Mahishmati on the day his father Amarendra Baahubali was executed by Kattappa and his mother Devasena was held captive by Bhallaladeva. Sivagami later flees with him from the castle to save him from Bhallaladeva and gives up her life to save him. The child is then found by Sanga and her husband belonging to a tribe who lives beyond the kingdom. The couple raises him as their own. Many years later, Mahendra climbs the waterfall and eventually enters Mahishmati. He rescues his mother Devasena and slays Bhallaladeva's son. Mahendra Baahubali is the spitting image of Amarendra Baahubali. Kattappa narrates the story of his heritage. Upon learning the truth, Mahendra rouses the people of Mahishmati to revolt against Bhallaladeva. In the ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva and Baahubali engage in a duel and Baahubali defeats Bhallaladeva. Baahubali's mother, Devasena, kills Bhallaladeva by immolating him alive. Baahubali later becomes the king of Mahishmati and marries Avantika. He has similar qualities to that of his father, like being creative, loyal, realistic, practical, wise, and valiant. = Antagonist = Bhallaladeva/Palvaalthevan Bhallaladeva is the king of Mahishmati. He is a renowned fighter, the only son of Sivagami and Bijjaladeva and brother of Amarendra Bahubali. He is envious of Amarendra Baahubali. When he is made King, he relieves Amarendra of his official duties and later convinces Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him. Bhallaladeva takes Devasena as a prisoner and frequently taunts her in her captive. He is killed by on a pyre prepared by Devasena. After his death, his golden statue was disposed of by the order of king Mahendra Baahubali. = Other main characters = Devasena Devasena is the lead female character of the Baahubali franchise along with Sivagami. Princess of Kuntala Kingdom, Devasena is a skilled fighter and a great archer. Amarendra Baahubali falls in love with her during a visit to Kuntala kingdom. Devasena reciprocates in her feelings toward him. She is brave and bold and believes firmly in her decisions, and it is through great practice that she achieves her martial skills. Devasena marries Baahubali, with whom she has a child, Mahendra Baahubali. Bhallaladeva wants Devasena's hand in marriage and makes his mother Sivagami promise that he would marry Devasena. Devasena (now in love with Baahubali) rejects the marriage proposal by Bhallaladeva and chooses Baahubali instead. Furious, Sivagami declares Bhallaladeva the new king of Mahishmati. Baahubali eventually dies at the hands of Kattappa, his trusted companion. On the day Baahubali dies, Devasena gives birth to Mahendra Baahubali. Sivagami eventually learns the truth about Bhallaladeva's treachery. Bhallaladeva orders his men to capture Devasena while Sivagami flees with baby Mahendra in her arms. Devasena is then tormented for the next 25 years. During her time in captivity, she prepares a pyre for Bhalla. Devasena would eventually be freed by her son Mahendra Baahubali (now called Sivudu/Shiva). Her son, Sivudu, after learning about his father's heritage and demise, sets out to avenge his death. After Bhallaladeva's death, Devasena becomes the new Queen Mother (Rajamatha) and announces Mahendra Baahubali as the new king of Mahishmati kingdom. Avanthika Avanthika is a skilled warrior and a fighter of the rebel group. Mahendra Baahubali falls in love with her and she later accepts him after she comes to know that he climbed the waterfall mountain just for her. As a guerrilla fighter, her life is devoted to a sole mission, saving Devasena from captivity in Mahishmati by Bhallaladeva. She is rebellious, a fierce warrior who fights for what is just. Like the other female leads of the series, she is strong and independent in her decisions and opinions. She fights alongside Mahendra Baahubali during the Mahishmati revolt and protects Devasena during the trial by fire ritual at the end of the sequel, Baahubali: The Conclusion. Sivagami Devi Rajamatha (Queen Mother) Sivagami is the former regent of the Mahishmati kingdom. She is a skilled fighter, feared by her enemies and seen to have thwarted enemies' plots to overthrow the kingdom. She is a true leader who treats everyone equally, including her son and nephew. She is a strong headed leader and the most powerful character in the Baahubali series, who decides the fate of Mahishmati. The first movie of the series portrays her as judicious in her decisions. The second movie of the series shows her grey side. She has her own imperfections: pride, temper and inflexibility, all of which lead her to persecute Amarendra Baahubali for marrying Devasena. Her father was ordered to be executed for treason by Maharaja Somadeva, Bijjaladeva's father and she was raised by her foster father Thimma. Sivagami became the foster mother of Amarendra Baahubali whose mother, the Queen of Mahishmati, died after giving birth to him. She assumes the guardian role of the throne until the princes are ready to rule the kingdom. Sivagami raises both her nephew Amarendra Baahubali and her son Bhallaladeva to be worthy heirs of the throne and when the time comes she decides to make one of them a king of Mahishmati. After a war with the Kalakeyas, Sivagami proclaims Baahubali as the new king of Mahishmati. She is manipulated by her husband Bijjaladeva and son Bhallaladeva into ordering Kattappa to kill Amarendra Baahubali, her nephew. Realising her mistake, she sacrifices her life in the attempt to save Mahendra Baahubali, the son of Amarendra Baahubali, from Bhallaladeva's treachery. Bijjaladeva/Pingalathevan He is the husband of Sivagami and father of Bhallaladeva, and former prince of Mahishmati during the reign of his father, Somadeva. He was born with a withered left hand. He has many bad habits, such as drinking, those being the reasons that he was replaced by his younger brother as the king of Mahishmati. Thus, he grew up resenting his brother and his family, and when Amarendra Baahubali was born, he hated him as well. After Sivagami announced Amarendra as the king, it only fed his jealousy. He may be considered the main antagonist alongside Bhallaladeva, as he is always generating hatred of Baahubali and Devasena in Bhallaladeva's mind. He is often compared to Dhritarashtra and Shakuni from Mahabharata and is said to be based on them. Kattappa Karikala Kattappa Nadar is the Commander of the King's royal bodyguard and Capital guards. Though he is a very skilled warrior, he is a slave till death to the Crown of Mahishmati. Kattapa's forefathers, beginning with Ugrappa, pledged their allegiance and loyalty to the rulers of Mahishmati for their assistance in avenging against Vaithalikas. He was appointed as the royal bodyguard of Bijjaladeva by the incumbent king, Somadeva, after he saved the lives of Bijjaladeva and Mahadeva (who later got the title of Vikramadeva). He was ordered by Sivagami and Bhallaladeva (then rulers) to kill Baahubali. He kills Amarendra Baahubali despite knowing he is innocent, just to uphold his loyalty towards the crown. Later he becomes the bodyguard and general of Mahendra Baahubali. Kumara Varma Kumara Varma is the brother of King Jaya Varma's unnamed wife. He lacks self-confidence until he meets Amarendra Baahubali, who boosts his confidence during the Pindaris' attack on the Kunthala Kingdom. He also had feelings for Devasena. He is killed by Bijjaladeva after having been tricked into an attempted assassination of Bhallaladeva as part of their plan to discredit Baahubali. = Supporting characters = #Sheikh Aslam Khan:- He is a sword-merchant from Persia, who befriends Kattappa during the weapons trade. The character appears in the first film. #Bhadrudu/Bhadra:- Bhadrudu is the son of Bhallaladeva. It has not been revealed who his mother is/was.

Director Rajamouli later revealed that Bhadrudu was adopted by Bhallaladeva to be his heir. #Inkoshi:- Inkoshi is the king of Kalakeyas, a tribe residing in a kingdom south of Mahishmati. He is killed by Bhallaladeva in the war. This character was featured in the first film 'The Beginning'. #Jai Varma:- King Jai Varma is the king of Kunthala Kingdom and father of Princess Devasena. After his entire Kingdom is destroyed by Bhallaladeva, Jaya Varma forms a rebellious group, to free Devasena. He is later killed by Bhallaladeva in the war. #Martanda:- At the time of Amarendra Bahubali's birth, Martanda colluded with few other ministers and conspired to take over the crown. Sivagami uncovered the plot and killed him, before taking control of the throne. #Setupati:- Bhallaladeva's loyal friend, who is later made chief lieutenant of Mahishmati by him. During Devasena's visit to the temple, he gropes several common women. Disgusted by this, Devasena cuts his fingers when he is about to grope her. When Devasena stood for trial before King Bhallaladeva for cutting off his fingers, Baahubali says, \\"If a man touches a woman without her permission, not his fingers, but his head, should be cut off!\\" and thus beheads him, showing his way of dispensing justice. #Sanga:- A tribal woman who adopts Mahendra Baahubali after the villagers spot him in the river held by Sivagami. She is the alpha female, being the wife of the chieftain and holds a powerful position in her tribe. #Sakethudu/Sakithan:- Sakethudu is a traitor, who sells Mahishmati's war secrets to the ruthless Kalakeyas. He fled to Singapuram, but was subsequently captured by Baahubali and Bhallaladeva. #Vaishali:- Avantika's friend and a member of the rebel group formed by now- ousted Kuntala king, Jaya Varma to rescue Devasena.

No different than Bhalla, Vaara too disrespects his subjects and cares only about the power he'll possess from taking the throne after his father. He opposes the treaty with Mahishmati against the barbarian threat and suggests that Sivagami is only trying to get rich off of their trading routes. After his sister Yamagni accidentally kills their father, he takes the crown and becomes king. #Yamagni:- Vaara's sister, whom she heavily despises for his lack of compassion. She disguises herself as a samurai and attempts to kill him, but her plan is found out by her new friend Amarendra Baahubali. She and Baahubali have feelings for each other shortly after they meet. When Baahubali finds out that she's been attacking her brother, he attempts to talk her out of it, unsure if she's right about the monstrous king Vaara would become. She tries to poison him, but the cup is given to her father who ends up dead from drinking it. Vaara believes their server attempted assassination and executes him as his first act as king. She and Bahubali later choose separate paths for the welfare of their lives and kingdoms. #Ravi:- A friend and guard of Mahishmati. He joins Amardendra on his quest to confront the beast that has been ravaging the trading routes of Mahishmati. Ravi is easily frightened and considered a coward by his friends, but Amarendra shows him sympathy and lets him join for the quest. For reasons unknown, Ravi is revealed to be a traitorous rogue who tries to kill Baahubali, wielding a hook and chain with a sedative poison on it. The beast, which turns out to be a tiger, saves Baahubali and kills Ravi after Baahubali saved her cubs. Amardendra tries to explain Ravi's treachery to Bhalla who unfortunately slew the mother tiger. Bhalla denies this believing Amarendra was delusional. #Avinash:- A close friend of Bhallaladeva who was usually against Baahubali's popularity. In the first episode, Avinash helps defend the attacked village from bandits but retreats with Bhalla when they fail. At the end of the episode, Bhalla shows him to where the royal family conducts a sacred ritual and how his father Bijaladeva was never allowed to participate since he was denied being king. When Avinash suggests it's because of his father's disability, Bhalla drowns his friend in cold blood, not without telling him how much he hates his brother and how much we craves to rule the kingdom with an iron fist the way his father could not. Days later, Avinash's parents are worried of his disappearance and Bhalla lies to them that Avinash feared his duties of being a warrior and ran away to find his own path, leaving his distraught parents ashamed. Bhalla claims that he didn't tell anyone and would not be a true friend if Avinash was dishonored, and slyly smiles when the rest of his friends leave. #Dharmraj:- An imposter who claims to be the son of a false king Jayadeva, whom he alleges to be the elder brother of Bijjaladeva's father Somadeva. He proclaims the throne as his, and the royal family agrees to it, as part of their plan, in which they later expose Dharmraj as an imposter. #Aakaanksh:- A close friend of both, Bahubali and Bhalladeva. He is seen as a refugee member of Prayagirajyam. #Kaalakhanjar:- A kind-hearted sea pirate who owned an island, and even though thought to be the cruellest of men, was very kind and always used to let people live freely on his island.

History  Franti≈°ek Xaver Brixi, or Franz Xaver Brixi, became Regens chori (choir director) of Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral in 1759 at age 27 and held the position unto his death in 1771. He was a prolific composer of music for the liturgy, who wrote more than 100 masses, vespers and motets, among others. He also composed secular music such as oratorios and incidental music, concertos and symphonies. He composed the Missa brevis in C, a setting of the Latin order of Mass, for SATB soloists and choir, 2 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, organ and continuo. The duration is given as 25 minutes. Karlheinz Ostermann, the editor of the first edition notes its \\"cantilena\\" solo melodies, simple themes for the choir, short fugal passages, and its optimistic mood. The mass was often copied, indicating that it was widely distributed. Five extant manuscripts have been found, three in today's Czech Republic, including Sedlec Abbey in Kutn√° Hora, in Litomƒõ≈ôice and Prague, in Austria in the Kremsm√ºnster Abbey, and in Germany in the Ottobeuren Abbey.

Flower was educated at Annesfield, and developed a strong connection to headmistress Anne Camfield. Throughout her life she fought for Aboriginal rights and to keep families together. In 1867 Flower relocated to the Ramahyuck Mission, in Gippsland, Victoria, where she worked as a teacher. Early life Flower was born to John and Mary Flower some time near 1851. Her family were Nyungar Aboriginal Australians and her parents worked for Henry and Anne Camfield. Henry was the government's representative and Anne started a school for native children which the Flower children attended. Bessie became a Christian and an outstanding pupil.Elizabeth (Bessy) (1851‚Äì1895) Cameron, Bain Attwood, ADB, Retrieved 19 May 2017 Flower was described as an \\"intelligent and bright child\\". She spoke French, played the harmonium, chess, and also excelled at the piano and singing. In 1864 she was sent to a Church of England 'model school' to further her studies. Upon returning to Annesfield in 1866, she worked alongside Anne Camfield as a teacher's assistant. Flower also worked as an organist at the local Anglican Church. In 1871 she was mentioned in a Select Committee report on the Aboriginal Natives, which summarised Anne Camfield's evidence saying \\"One girl, sent to Sydney, played for some time the harmonium in St. Philip‚Äôs Church, and gained her living by teaching...\\".‚ÄúHandbook of Western Australia‚Äù, C G Nicolay, 1880  Life in Gippsland  In 1867 Flower was given an opportunity which appeared to provide her a chance to improve her teaching. She was offered a teaching position at Ramahyuck Mission in Gippsland in Victoria, but the real plan seemed to have been for her to become a wife to one of Friedrich Hagenauer's favourite converts. Bessie's parents were both Aboriginal whereas her husband, Adolph Donald Cameron, was classed as a 'half- caste'. They married when Bessie was 17 and they had eight children. Both Adolph and Bessie left Hagenauer's employment but his influence continued. In 1886 the government passed legislation that forced Aboriginal people under 34 years of age with non-Aboriginal parentage (so-called 'half-castes') to leave missions. This meant that Bessie and Adolph were separated from their family and forced to move out and live in a hostile settler community. She found, therefore, that the authorities were trying to separate her from her children. The secretary of the board in charge of that decision, as it happened, was Friedrich Hagenauer himself. They were ultimately allowed to return to Ramahyuck Mission, but two of their daughters were forcibly indentured as domestic servants. For the last years of her life, Bessie lived at Ramahyuck from time to time and continued to try and help her children and other Aboriginal women to keep their families together. She died of peritonitis in 1895 and was buried in the Bairnsdale cemetery. She was survived by her husband, three daughters and two sons.

The formula characterizes \\"holographic screens\\" in the bulk; that is, it specifies which regions of the bulk geometry are \\"responsible to particular information in the dual CFT\\". The conjecture is named after Shinsei Ryu and Tadashi Takayanagi, who jointly published the result in 2006. As a result, the authors were awarded the 2015 New Horizons in Physics Prize for \\"fundamental ideas about entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity\\". The formula was generalized to a covariant form in 2007. Motivation The thermodynamics of black holes suggests certain relationships between the entropy of black holes and their geometry. Specifically, the Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking area formula conjectures that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area: :S_\\\\text{BH} = \\\\frac{k_\\\\text{B} A}{4\\\\ell_\\\\text{P}^2} The Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking entropy S_\\\\text{BH} is a measure of the information lost to external observers due to the presence of the horizon. The horizon of the black hole acts as a \\"screen\\" distinguishing one region of the spacetime (in this case the exterior of the black hole) that is not affected by another region (in this case the interior). The Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking area law states that the area of this surface is proportional to the entropy of the information lost behind it. The Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking entropy is a statement about the gravitational entropy of a system; however, there is another type of entropy that is important in quantum information theory, namely the entanglement (or von Neumann) entropy. This form of entropy provides a measure of how far from a pure state a given quantum state is, or, equivalently, how entangled it is. The entanglement entropy is a useful concept in many areas, such as in condensed matter physics and quantum many-body systems. Given its use, and its suggestive similarity to the Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking entropy, it is desirable to have a holographic description of entanglement entropy in terms of gravity. Holographic preliminaries The holographic principle states that gravitational theories in a given dimension are dual to a gauge theory in one lower dimension. The AdS/CFT correspondence is one example of such duality. Here, the field theory is defined on a fixed background and is equivalent to a quantum gravitational theory whose different states each correspond to a possible spacetime geometry. The conformal field theory is often viewed as living on the boundary of the higher dimensional space whose gravitational theory it defines. The result of such a duality is a dictionary between the two equivalent descriptions. For example, in a CFT defined on d dimensional Minkowski space the vacuum state corresponds to pure AdS space, whereas the thermal state corresponds to a planar black hole. Important for the present discussion is that the thermal state of a CFT defined on the d dimensional sphere corresponds to the d+1 dimensional Schwarzchild black hole in AdS space. The Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking area law, while claiming that the area of the black hole horizon is the black hole's entropy, fails to provide a sufficient microscopic description of how this entropy arises. The holographic principle provides such a description by relating the black hole system to a quantum system which does admit such a microscopic description. In this case, the CFT has discrete eigenstates and the thermal state is the canonical ensemble of these states. The entropy of this ensemble can be calculate through normal means, and yields the same result as predicted by the area law. This turns out to be a special case of the Ryu‚ÄìTakayanagi conjecture. Conjecture Consider a spatial slice \\\\Sigma of an AdS space time on whose boundary we define the dual CFT. The Ryu‚ÄìTakayanagi formula states: where S_A is the entanglement entropy of the CFT in some spatial sub-region A \\\\subset \\\\partial \\\\Sigma with its complement B, and \\\\gamma_A is the Ryu‚ÄìTakayanagi surface in the bulk. This surface must satisfy three properties: # \\\\gamma_A has the same boundary as A . # \\\\gamma_A is homologous to A. # \\\\gamma_A extremizes the area. If there are multiple extremal surfaces, \\\\gamma_A is the one with the least area. Because of property (3), this surface is typically called the minimal surface when the context is clear. Furthermore, property (1) ensures that the formula preserves certain features of entanglement entropy, such as S_A = S_B and S_{A_1 + A_2} \\\\geq S_{A_1 \\\\cup A_2} . The conjecture provides an explicit geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy of the boundary CFT, namely as the area of a surface in the bulk. Example In their original paper, Ryu and Takayanagi show this result explicitly for an example in \\\\text{AdS}_3 / \\\\text{CFT}_2 where an expression for the entanglement entropy is already known. For an \\\\text{AdS}_3 space of radius R , the dual CFT has a central charge given by Furthermore, \\\\text{AdS}_3 has the metric ds^2 = R^2(-\\\\cosh{\\\\rho^2 dt^2} + d\\\\rho^2 + \\\\sinh{\\\\rho^2 d\\\\theta^2}) in (t, \\\\rho, \\\\theta) (essentially a stack of hyperbolic disks). Since this metric diverges at \\\\rho \\\\to \\\\infty , \\\\rho is restricted to \\\\rho \\\\leq \\\\rho_0 . This act of imposing a maximum \\\\rho is analogous to the corresponding CFT having a UV cutoff. If L is the length of the CFT system, in this case the circumference of the cylinder calculated with the appropriate metric, and a is the lattice spacing, we have e^{\\\\rho_0} \\\\sim L/a. In this case, the boundary CFT lives at coordinates (t, \\\\rho_0, \\\\theta) = (t, \\\\theta) . Consider a fixed t slice and take the subregion A of the boundary to be \\\\theta \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi l / L] where l is the length of A . The minimal surface is easy to identify in this case, as it is just the geodesic through the bulk that connects \\\\theta = 0 and \\\\theta = 2 \\\\pi l/L. Remembering the lattice cutoff, the length of the geodesic can be calculated as If it is assumed that e^{\\\\rho_0} >> 1, then using the Ryu‚ÄìTakayanagi formula to compute the entanglement entropy. Plugging in the length of the minimal surface calculated in () and recalling the central charge charge (), the entanglement entropy is given by )} }} This agrees with the result calculated by usual means.

(10 July 1936 - 27 June 2000) was a Guyanese long distance runner who represented Guyana in the Marathon at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico. He is known to be one of the greatest Marathon runners Guyana has ever produced, setting the national record in 1968. To date, he is the only Guyanese ever to compete in the Marathon at the Summer Olympic Games and one of the most prominent Indo-Caribbean long distance runners of his time. He also participated in the 10,000 metres at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and represented Guyana at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. Prowell holds the Guyana National Track and Field Record in the Marathon with a personal best time of 2:39:11 set on 4 February 1968 in St. Georges, Grenada. He was awarded Guyana's National Sportsman of the Year in 1969 and received the Order of Service of Guyana (Grade II) known as the Golden Arrow of Achievement in 1970. Prowell died on 27 June 2000 at age 63 in Success, East Coast Demerara, Guyana. Early life and career Harry Prowell was born in La Bonne Intention (L.B.I.) Estate, East Coast Demerara, Guyana to Indo-Guyanese parents. LBI is a village 10 miles east of the capital Georgetown, Guyana. He would often be seen running from LBI to Georgetown and back again. Known to the locals for his notorious barefoot running style, he rose to prominence at St. Mary-Ye- Virgin Anglican School in Beterverwagting, Guyana. At the annual Inter Estate Athletics Championships, which was well organized and held at various Sugar Estate grounds across British Guiana, he became a household name for his success in long distance running. At these early events he would race against his future nemesis, Moses Dwarika, who would later compete alongside him for British Guiana at the British West Indies Championships. International career =British Guiana= 1958 British West Indies Championships At the age of 22, Prowell was selected to represent British Guiana at the 1958 British West Indies Championships held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. This would be his first international competition. He would go on to win the Silver Medal in the 5000 m and 10,000 m, setting personal best times of 15:15:00 and 31:57:03 respectively. This event showcased some of Guyana's greatest long distance runners. Prowell, Moses Dwarika, George de Peana and Ralph Gomes would go on to dominate Caribbean long distance athletics for the next decade. 1960 British West Indies Championships The British West Indies Championships took a three-year hiatus. With the West Indies Federation being dissolved, the 5th edition of the track and field competition, 1964 British West Indies Championships, took place in Kingston, Jamaica. Prowell's 10,000 m race had been dropped and he did not compete in the games. =Guyana= With British Guiana achieving independence from the United Kingdom in May 1966, Prowell would now represent the independent nation of Guyana. 1967 Pan American Games In 1967, he was selected to represent his country in the 10,000 metres at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He would finish eighth in the race. 1968 Summer Olympic Games At the age of 32, the highlight of Harry Prowell's career came with representing Guyana at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico. The race was held on Sunday 20 October 1968 and started at 15.00h (3PM EST). There were a total number of 75 competitors from 41 countries. Eighteen of them did not finish. To date he is the only Guyanese ever to compete for Guyana in the Marathon at the Summer Olympic Games. As Prowell was training for the 1968 Summer Olympics, he set his personal best record of 2:39:11 in a Marathon on 4 February 1968 at a track event in St. George's, Grenada. Leading up to the Olympics he also won a Gold Medal in the Marathon at the 1968 Texaco Southern Games in San Fernando, Trinidad, followed by a Gold Medal in the 3000 m race at the annual Inter Estate Athletics Championships in Guyana Notable runners Boyo Changur placed second and Gladstone Hopkinson placing third. Guyana sent five men to the 1968 Summer Olympics. The West Indies Champion, 32-year-old Harry Prowell was a favorable contender in the Men's Marathon. However, the high altitude of Mexico, City affected the race and it was referred to as one of the slowest marathons in Olympic history. With the unfavorable conditions, Prowell placed a respectable 50th place with a time of 2:57:01.4. 1970 British Commonwealth Games His last international event came with his participation in the 1970 British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. =Guyana National Awards= Harry Prowell was awarded Guyana's National Sportsman of the Year in 1969 and received the Order of Service of Guyana (Grade II) known as the Golden Arrow of Achievement in 1970.

Located at 177 Milk Street in the Custom House District, at the edge of the Financial District near the waterfront, it is distinguished by the large black slate conical roof at its western end. It is also called just the Grain Exchange Building and sometimes the Boston Chamber of Commerce Building. This building was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1994. The Flour and Grain Exchange Building was built from 1891 to 1893 for its original occupant, the Boston Chamber of Commerce on land donated for that purpose by Henry Melville Whitney. It was designed by the firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge (now Shepley Bulfinch), founded by the successors of Henry Hobson Richardson, and in the Romanesque Revival style often associated with Richardson. The building exterior is of pink Milford granite. The Flour and Grain Exchange Building is seven stories tall, with two additional stories in a cylindrical turret at the west end. The ornate facade features three-storey roundheaded windows at the middle floors. Triangular attic dormers topped by crocket finials at the turret give a crown-like aspect to the conical roof. The Boston Chamber of Commerce was created by the merger of two bodies, the Boston Commercial Exchange and the Boston Produce Exchange, in 1885. Whitney, an industrialist and Chamber member, donated land for a building for the new body. Construction by the Norcross Brothers firm began in 1890 and the building was dedicated in January 1892. The Chamber occupied part of the building (the remainder was let to banks and other concerns) until 1902, when it was occupied by the Flour and Grain Exchange. A plaque in the building commemorates its hosting of the 5th International Congress of Chambers of Commerce and of Commercial and Industrial Associations in 1912, attended by American President William Howard Taft and delegates from fifty- five countries.

Overview EG Group sells Esso, BP, Shell and Texaco branded fuel, and operates third party retail brands in its back court operations, such as KFC, Spar, Carrefour, Louis Delhaize, Starbucks, Greggs, Burger King and Subway.  History  Euro Garages was co founded by brothers Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa in 2001, who expanded the business from a single site (at a cost of ¬£150,000) in Bury, Greater Manchester and had grown to circa 340 sites in the UK. The growth co-incided with oil companies selling off their consumer petrol station assets to focus on their core production and refining buisiness. In October 2015, the private equity firm TDR Capital acquired a stake in the company. In October 2016, Euro Garages acquired the Dutch headquartered European Forecourt Retail Group (founded in 2007, and was the European energy retail and marketing arm of Delek Group, before being acquired by TDR Capital in August 2014) from TDR Capital to form the Intervias Group, later renamed the EG Group. As a consequence of these transactions, TDR Capital now owns 50% of the enlarged group, with Zuber Issa owning 25% and Mohsin Issa the remaining 25%. The combination of EG and EFR sought to create a scaled and diversified pan European platform that shares best practices and economizes on common shared services, led by EG‚Äôs highly respected group executive team. The business is headquartered in Blackburn, United Kingdom, and has completed construction of a new global headquarters building, also in Blackburn.

They were built in 1924 and 1930 for brothers Fuller and Harry Barnes, owners of the locally prominent Wallace Barnes Company, later American Spring. Both are major works by regionally prominent architects, and the pair were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Chimney Crest is in private ownership; Copper Ledges is in private ownership. Description and history The Barnes family compound is located on the northeast side of Bristol's Federal Hill area, its most fashionable residential area of the early 20th century. Chimney Crest, a large Tudor mansion house stands at the southeast corner of Founders Drive and Woodland Street. Copper Ledges, a large Colonial Revival mansion, stands at the bend in Founders Drive just east of Bradley Street. The estate property, originally , has been subdivided for development, and now only remain associated with these two houses. Outbuildings of the compound include a guest house and log cabin, both on the east side of Founders Drive, and a loggia at the southern end of Copper Ledges's formal gardens. Copper Crest, up on top of the hill Fuller Barnes and Henry Barnes were the grandsons of Wallace Barnes, who began manufacturing springs for clocks in the 1860s. The brothers greatly expanded the business, transforming it into the American Spring Company. Fuller Barnes acquired this estate property in 1920, and Copper Ledges was built for him in 1924. It was designed by Henry Hayden, a local architect, and is judged his most significant residential commission. Late in his life he donated it to Bristol Hospital, with the idea that it be used as a convalescent home. This idea proved unworkable, and the estate was from 1960 to 1970 home to the Laurel Crest Academy, which built ancillary buildings on Bradley Street, and also rented Chimney Crest. Chimney Crest was built for Henry Barnes in 1930; it was designed by Perry & Bishop, based in New Britain.

Career  Pescod joined the civil service in British Hong Kong in August 1981. He became an official Justice of the Peace in 1998. Between June 2001 and November 2004, he was Deputy Commissioner for Tourism. Pescod was posted to Brussels as Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic Trade Affairs to the European Communities between 2006 and 2008. He received the Chief Executive's Commendation for Government/Public Service in 2006. From 2008 to 2010, he was Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development (Communications and Technology). From then till 2014, he was Permanent Secretary for Transport and Housing (Housing) and Director of Housing. Upon his return from his post in Brussels, Pescod and his wife bought a house in Clearwater Bay, Sai Kung, as a retirement home and investment. In 2012, during his tenure as chief of housing, Ming Pao Daily reported that several unauthorised structures had been found at this property. This negative attention came at a time when other prominent officials, including Chief Executive CY Leung, were found to have similarly illegal structures. He retired from the Planning Department in 2014 after thirty-three years in the civil service to join the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. Later that year he was awarded a Gold Bauhinia Star for \\"contributions in the areas of economic and trade, communications and technology, as well as housing.\\" He joined the semi-independent WKCDA as chief operating officer in October, and rose to the CEO position when Michael Lynch stepped down a year later. His prominent position at the WKCDA was not well received by lawmakers or the arts community. EJ Insight noted it appeared to be a pro-government move at a time when 16 board members were due to retire at the end of their 6-year terms. At one point, the project was controlled by Henry Tang, failed Chief Executive candidate, whose appointment was seen as a conciliatory play by the elected victor Leung.  Personal life  Pescod was born in Sierra Leone, West Africa, and grew up in Thailand. He went to Sedbergh School in England between 1972 and 1977. He spent 1977 to 1981 at Leeds University, at which he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology with Honours. EJ Insight reported in 2014 that he was living in a 5000sf house on Victoria Peak leased for $230,000 a month, of which he was paying just $16,000 due to civil service benefits. Pescod's forays into public life beyond the civil service include chairing the Peak School Council, the Children's Heart Foundation and the Valley Rugby Football Club, and a position on the Board of the Ocean Park Corporation in the early noughties.

History  While its exact foundation date is unknown, some sources allege that Nattoreh was first set up on 1 October 2011. Since its formation, the militia has taken part in several Syrian Democratic Forces-led operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, such as the Manbij offensive, the Raqqa campaign and the Deir ez-Zor offensive (September 2017‚Äìpresent). Nattoreh also protects ceremonies and celebrations of the Assyrian Church of the East. On 25 February 2017, the Assyrian Democratic Party agreed to join the Syrian Democratic Council, and the YPG agreed to hand over security in the Assyrian towns along the Khabur River to the Khabour Guards and Nattoreh, both of which joined the Syrian Democratic Forces.
