A sequel, Cyberia 2: Resurrection, was released in 1995 for both DOS and Windows 9x formats. Gameplay Zak using the mercenary rig's gun turrets to shoot down Cartel ships Cyberia uses prerendered visuals during gameplay, and boasted impressive graphics for its time. While mostly linear, there are two points in the game where the player makes a decision that can change important outcomes. There are four basic methods of gameplay which Cyberia employs: exploring the environment through walking (from node to node), attempting to complete puzzles in a full screen view, using a gun turret to shoot down planes, and flying in various vehicles. Direction and speed during flight are computer controlled; the player controls weapons firing. Vehicles include the TF-22 Transfighter stealth jet, a nanotech virus cleaner, \\"Charlie\\" the remotely operated decontamination robot, and the Cyberia weapon itself. Weapons and methods of attack are few in the exploring sections of gameplay. Attached to Zak's suit is a heat pulse weapon that can be fired from Zak's arm. The only other modes of attack during the walking portions of the game consist of traps that must be set to outsmart an enemy, which goes hand-in-hand with the occasional demand for stealth. For the gun turret portion, two heat-charged energy blasts are released from each side of the turret when Zak fires it. When flying the stealth aircraft, Zak is able to dispense continuous bolts of blue energy at the cost of the aircraft's power supply. When controlling the virus cleaner, Zak is able to do likewise. The \\"Charlie\\" robot adds a new form of attack: a weapon which kills all enemies on the screen at the cost of a decent amount of the machine's energy. A similar electrical energy weapon seen on the virus cleaner is also used when Zak is joined with the Cyberia weapon. The various puzzles in the game can range from requiring the player to figure out the password on a computer to disarming a bomb on a stealth aircraft. Zak can use his suit's BLADES (Bi-optic Low Amplitude Displayed Energy System) to scan the current puzzle in several ways for help in completing the puzzle. The three modes of Zak's BLADES are as follows: *InfraRed/Thermal Scan - Detects heat traces and marks left in the InfraRed spectrum. This scan is very sensitive, and thus very accurate. *Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Allows Zak to \\"look through\\" a puzzle object to determine an item's function and the way it operates. *BioScan - Scans the area for organic matter in a limited range. Puzzle difficulty and arcade difficulty are set in the beginning of the game, but setting both to \\"easy\\" is not permitted; if the player attempts to do so, the game will inform the player that it will be \\"too easy.\\" Arcade difficulty controls the toughness of the combat in the game (both on the ground and in the air). The Saturn version of the game supports the mouse and mission stick in addition to the standard controller. The 3DO version supports only the standard controller and flight stick. The PlayStation version is one of the few games compatible with the PlayStation Mouse. Plot Cyberia is set in the near future of the year 2027, five years after a global economic collapse. The world is under the dominion of two opposing superpowers, the First World Alliance in the west and the Cartel in the east. William Devlin, the leader of the FWA, receives word that a devastating weapon is being produced in a secret base in Siberia, referred to as the Cyberia Complex. Curious to unravel the mysteries of this weapon, Devlin pardons a cyber-hacker named Zebulon Pike \\"Zak\\" Kingston and charges him with the task of infiltrating the Complex and retrieving intel on the weapon being produced there. Already getting wind of Cyberia's secret operations, the Cartel seizes control of the Complex with the same goal as the FWA‚Äìto discover the nature of the super weapon being produced by a third party. Zak is scheduled to rendezvous with an oil rig run by an FWA-contracted mercenary group managed by Luis Arturo Santos and his assistant Gia Scarlatti to pick up a TF-22 TransFighter, a sophisticated aircraft that will ensure Zak's arrival at the Cyberia Complex. Shortly after arriving the oil rig is attacked by the Cartel. After Zak and Gia defend the rig using gun turrets, the mercenaries, sensing betrayal, move to kill Zak by hunting him down and sabotaging the TF-22. Zak eventually steals the TF-22 and travels through several hostile locales en route to the Cyberia Complex; a mountain range infested with Cartel hoverfighters, a Cartel-run oceanlab, and a commuter tunnel are among the places visited by Zak. Eventually, the TF-22 reaches the Cyberia Complex and Zak proceeds to wreak havoc on the Cartel's analysis efforts. While exploring the Complex, Zak encounters more than Cartel soldiers, as he is forced to eradicate the Complex scientists experimental virus which killed some of the Cartel soldiers. After purging the virus from the Complex, Zak uncovers the Cyberion, an amorphous collection of miniature robots, or nanites, that has achieved sentience. Devlin then contacts Zak and informs him that the cyber-hacker himself is a weapon, which Cyberion explains to mean that a high-yield explosive device has been implanted into Zak's brain. Upon reaching the Cyberion, Devlin had intended to detonate the device from orbit, eliminating the weapon and killing Zak simultaneously. Zak, frustrated over Devlin's betrayal and upon Cyberion's suggestion, merges with the Cyberion which defuses the explosive device in Zak's head. Together, Zak and the Cyberion launch into space to confront Devlin in the FWA space station. The station's defenses are slowly crippled until the Cyberion and Zak make the final move and kill the treacherous Devlin by destroying the station. The resulting shockwave causes the Cyberion/Zak amalgamation to lose consciousness while it plummets to Earth. Upon crashing, an FWA retrieval team led by a Doctor John Corbin is heard hoisting up the remains of Cyberion/Zak into a helicopter. Reception Reviews for Cyberia were generally mixed. For the most part, the game's cinematic, prerendered visuals were lauded; according to Philip Jong of Adventure Classic Gaming, Cyberia was \\"one of the first game titles to combine computer animations and Hollywood film technique to form visually stunning graphics and cut scenes.\\" Similarly, IGN stated that the \\"use of multiple camera angles, eerie soundtrack, detailed light-sourcing, and short, effective cut-sequences really pulls the player into the game.\\" Radion Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine likewise commented that \\"the graphics remain stylistically constant pretty much throughout (apart from the ropey anti-aircraft concept), displaying solid-looking rendered characters and backgrounds in a cinematic enough fashion to carry the atmosphere.\\" Scary Larry and Tommy Glide of GamePro both noted the excellent polygon rendering on the characters and the detailed backgrounds. A reviewer for Next Generation praised the rendered graphics, soundtrack, and \\"absorbing\\" storyline, and said that even with the very limited interactivity, \\"Cyberia keeps itself above the competition by mixing sequences with puzzles and plot devices that keep the gamer drawn into the story\\". Maximum complimented the \\"slick metallic looking graphics\\", though like Radion Automatic they found the graphics of the anti- aircraft sections unimpressive. Despite the praise over the game's aesthetics, reviewers found shortcomings in Cyberia's linear gameplay. In his review, Jong goes on to criticize the game's \\"weak puzzles ... [that are] not well integrated into the story or gameplay.\\" He concludes by saying that Cyberia is \\"a classic example of beauty but no substance.\\" In IGN's words, \\"gameplay does tend to suffer in graphic adventures, which usually consists of doing things over and over until you do it right.\\" Radion Automatic felt that the gameplay was enjoyable, but acknowledged that \\"it's hard to think who to recommend it to. The role-play element isn't quite deep enough to appeal to solid adventure fans and the action is a bit too simple for super-speed cyber-shoot-'em-up heads.\\" Maximum echoed these remarks: \\"RPG purists will find this too shallow and action fans will find it too dull.\\" They elaborated that the game tends to switch between gameplay styles abruptly, with no rhyme or reason, making it difficult to get involved with the game. Scary Larry complained of twitchy controls, and said that the game focuses too much on puzzle elements and not enough on action. Tommy Glide found the controls to be initially confusing and annoying, and said the game lacks replay value. One reviewer for Next Generation found the chief problem to be that Cyberia doesn't allow the player to explore and \\"[create] your own story\\", while another simply stated that \\"it never achieves the level of interactivity that's required to make it a truly great game.\\" Reviews for the game showed little variation across the four different versions (PC, PlayStation, Saturn, and 3DO), and a Next Generation critic stated that the four versions are \\"exactly\\" alike. Cyberia 2: Resurrection Cyberia 2: Resurrection was released in 1995 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows as a sequel. It features the same gameplay as the original with improved 3D-rendered graphics and an increase in the amount of in-game cinematics. The story picks up where the first game ended. After Zak and the Cyberia weapon crash land back on Earth following the destruction of Devlin's orbital headquarters, they are intercepted by an FWA team led by a Dr. Corbin. Corbin, under orders from his FWA employers, places Zak in cryo-storage and uses the remains of the Cyberia weapon to create a deadly virus called nano- toxin. Though the FWA seeks to quell a growing rebel movement with the nano- toxin, the maniacal Corbin intends to use it to kill millions and \\"reshape the world as we know it.\\" After three years in cryo-storage, Zak is thawed out by a renegade FWA major, and together the two of them set out to find Corbin and stop his plans. Cyberia 2 received a score of 82/100 from Computer Game Review.

When built in 1976, it was the first roller coaster in the world with 3 inversions. The coaster, which features Arrow's first vertical loop, was built during the same time period as The Great American Revolution at Magic Mountain. However, Revolution opened seven days prior and is therefore credited as the first modern-day coaster to feature a vertical loop. Characteristics =Location= The ride's station is located on the midway directly across from Top Thrill Dragster and next to Super Himalaya and near Power Tower. It was the first coaster to have inversions featuring a walkway underneath. =Trains= Corkscrew originally had three 24 passenger trains painted red, white & blue, a color scheme inspired by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976, the year the ride was introduced. The ride currently operates with two trains to reduce the excessive stacking on the brake run. Riders are restrained by over-the-shoulder restraints with interlocking seat belts and are required to be to ride. As the restraints cannot be unlocked by all cars at once, pedals are hinged on the backs of the cars to be manually released and locked individually by ride operators on the platform. Ride experience =Layout= The train exits the station when the ride operator releases the pneumatic station brakes. The train reaches a slight decline that allows the car to roll out and around a 180 degree turnaround and ascends the 30-degree and 85-foot (26 m) chain lift hill, operating at a speed of . The train then descends at a 45-degree angle at a top speed of 48 mph (77 km/h). The train enters a bunny hop, drops lower than the main drop, and enters a vertical loop. The train goes up to a short straightaway before descending a banked 180 degree right turn into the two consecutive corkscrews over the midway of the park, traveling at . Lastly, the train enters a slight ascending right turn followed by a shallow left turn and then enters the brake run with trim and block brakes before returning back into the station. =Track= The ride is long, consisting of blue tubular steel track with a separation between tubes, built on , rides for 1 minute and 40 seconds, and has two 24-passenger trains. Almost daily, a train is transferred off the track once ridership reaches a point that permits two- train operation with little or no waiting in line. A different train is cycled off each day. The ride was designed by Ron Toomer and built by Arrow Dynamics. The total cost of construction was , and the ride has had over 30 million total riders since opening in May 197  Reception  While reception of the ride was positive when it opened, it now gets mixed to negative reviews now. The ride is said to be rough, boring, and too short by riders today. Other Arrow loopers have similar reactions (minus being short), although those are received more positively. Records 1\\\\.

It was instigated by Datu Muhammad Salleh (also known as Mat Salleh), a local chief from the Lingkabo district and Sugut River. He led the rebellion between 1894 until his death in Tambunan in 1900. The resistance then continued on for another 5 years until 1905.Sources conflict about the end date of the rebellion. Some state 1903, others 1905. His revolts were widely supported by the local communities and affected a large geographical area from Sandakan, across Gaya Island, including the interior, especially Tambunan. His most notable uprising occurred at midnight on 9 July 1897, when he led his followers to successfully attack a major colonial settlement on Gaya Island. Biography of Mat Salleh Datu Mat Salleh Mat Salleh was born in Inanam. His father was Datu Balu, a traditional leader in Inanam and a member of the Suluk community. His mother was of Bajau descent. He had three siblings: Ali, Badin and Bolong. The family moved to Sugut, which unlike Inanam, was in the Company's concession but since the abandonment of its tobacco estates, it had reportedly been \\"left largely to its own devices\\", and enjoyed relative autonomy. There, Datu Bulu assumed a local leadership position along part of the Sugut River on the eastern coast of North Borneo. Later in his life, Mat Salleh married a Sulu princess named Dayang Bandang. She was related to the Sultan of Sulu's family and her village was at Penggalaban (maguindanaun dialogue), Paitan. He later inherited his father‚Äôs local leadership position as the village chieftain in the Lingkabau district and Sungei Sugut. Mat Salleh was often physically described as slender and tall, with pockmarked features. He was also well known as a mysterious Some of his supporters believed he possessed supernatural powers that made him invulnerable to physical harm and the inability to be hurt or killed by conventional weapons (typically known as Kebal in the Malay language). Even, invisibility so as not to be seen by his enemies. For many, his ability to repeatedly evade the Company's attacks served as proof of these claims. and intelligent man, with a commanding personality and presence. He was well-respected and his great tactical skills were renowned among the local communities. Salleh's supporters This is, apparently, the only known available photograph of Mat Salleh (marked with a white \\"X\\"). His mixed parentage and role as a traditional local leader which he had inherited from his father contributed to his significant Bajau and Suluk following. Also, his marriage to Dayang Bandang, who was related to the ruling family in Sulu helped him win more supporters. However, his wide support not only came from his family affiliations and connections. He was also able to garner supporters from Dusun communities spread over a sizeable geographical area in Sabah and had the Tagahas communities as allies, among others. He was skilled at connecting with and uniting other communities, making him a great personage among the multi-ethnic indigenous people. For example, some accounts claim that he used and married various symbols of authority and mysticism that the different communities could relate with to attest to his leadership position and military prowess.Some symbols that he used were enormous silk umbrellas (high society), insignia of royalty, and even inscriptions that were apparently believed to make him invincible. The large geographical areas where his support came from proved instrumental in ensuring the initial success of his revolt as these areas were available to provide power bases, supplies and construction of forts. This also implied that he and his army had ample mobility between forts and bases, which explains their successful repeated evasions of the Company‚Äôs troops. From 1895‚Äì1897, he had at his disposal at least six forts which were well-prepared with resources and manpower that he could mobilise at short notice. The forts that his followers built were impressively very well designed and constructed. They were reportedly to have been the:- The British North Borneo Chartered Company =Changes imposed= W. C. Cowie, Managing Director with the Sultan of Sulu Before the arrival of the British, central authority in Sabah was weak. Part of it was governed by Brunei and part by the Sulu government. This gave local chiefs and traditional elites relative autonomy to practice influence and power to regulate trade in the area and serve the responsibility of protecting the local inhabitants from excessive exploitation by foreign traders. The British arrived during the late 19th century, and their administration (under the London-based British North Borneo Chartered Company) in North Borneo lasted sixty years, between 1881 and 1941. It aimed to transform North Borneo into a producer of various agricultural products, predominantly tobacco. Apart from the introduction of cash-crop farming, the Company also imposed new taxation laws and set up administrative centres. Some of the changes brought about by them were: * Introduction of new taxes, including a levy on rice, the staple food of the population. * Poll-tax and passes for boats on local communities, including members of the local elites and traditional leaders. * Mandatory licenses for local boat owners. * Passed a Village Ordinance, resulting in the Company not sanctioning the authority and traditional social position of a large number of traditional elites and local chiefs. This consequently alienated them and undermined their roles and social statuses. * A customs station was built on Jambongan Island, staffed by a non-European clerk and policeman. * A new police station was established on the Kinarom. In its attempt to revitalise the sagging economy, then managing director of the British North Borneo Company, William C. Cowie also launched two major projects: * The construction of a cross-country rail between Brunei Bay and Cowie Harbour * A telegraphic line from Labuan to Sandakan New levies were imposed to finance these large-scale projects. Lack of manpower, however, caused the Company to rely on local chieftains as agents for revenue collection. Among those who cooperated with the Company, some abused their authority and overtaxed the natives, exacerbating dissatisfaction among local people already burdened by other new laws imposed by the Company. Mat Salleh viewed the Company‚Äôs new rules as an infringement of native rights, refused to acknowledge the Company's authority, and continued to collect taxes from traders traveling via the Sugut River as he had before the rules were imposed, without turning them over to the Company. Numerous other local chiefs shared Mat Salleh's strong opinions against the Company's new rules. Many of them later joined his cause. =Administrative centre relocated from Gaya Island to the mainland= The Company had set up its initial administrative centres on the west coast of Sabah in Papar and Tempassuk. In between these areas also stood the Gaya station,Gaya Island (along with other locations in the west coast of Sabah) was acquired by the British through an agreement with the Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Abdul Mumin Ebn Marhoum Maulana Abdul Wahab on 29 December 1877. set up in September 1882 as a collection station for jungle and local produce. This station also served as a \\"stopping place\\" for European officials plying between Kudat and Labuan. Gaya Island was initially thought of as a highly prospective settlement site and a possible port of call. It later however, did not flourish as expected; trade, collection of local produce and other economic activities did not prosper. After the station in Gaya was raided and torched by Mat Salleh and his followers in July 1897,Some British colonial sources claim that the abandonment of Gaya was not entirely caused by Mat Salleh. After the raid, the Company attempted to rebuild the township. However, it failed to economically flourish. Also, the company's railway project (above-mentioned under changes imposed after the arrival of the British North Borneo Chartered Company's arrival) that were started in 1896 had reached a stage where a suitable exit point was needed at the end of the line from Beaufort and Weston. As Gaya is an island, it had to be ruled out, and a new site had to be found on the mainland. With the acquisition of new territories from Brunei. There were also many new and more suitable sites to choose from. the British relocated to the mainland, in Gantian. Mat Salleh uprisings, 1895‚Äì1905 =1894= Mat Salleh first came to the Company's attention when he was suspected of involvement in the murder and robbery of two Iban traders on the Sugut River in 1894. Captain Barnett and a few other colonial officials were sent to Mat Salleh's residence to investigate the matter.Some sources claim that Captain Barnett and his men were sent to confront, accuse and detain him. During this confrontation, Captain Barnett had attempted to forcefully apprehend Mat Salleh, but was outnumbered by his followers, ready to take up arms to protect him. Mat Salleh denied his and his followers‚Äô involvement in it and resisted arrest. This incident marked the first of many misunderstandings, creating a tense and hostile situation between both parties. =1895 (Sandakan incident)= In August 1895, in an attempt to have their grievances addressed through the colonial institution, Mat Salleh, his followers and traditional chiefs from Sugut went to Sandakan, then the seat of the government of North Borneo, to present a petition against the collection of poll-tax and the imposition of passes on boats by Government chiefs to then governor L. P. Beaufort and his representatives.There are two versions of this incident # Mat Salleh came peacefully and apart from presenting his petition, meant to clear his name and settle the misunderstanding regarding his involvement in the Iban murders. Instead, he was treated with hostility by then present treasurer-in-general Alexander Cook, who then turned him away, causing much embarrassment to Mat Salleh. # Mat Salleh arrived with an armed entourage of boats to present their petitions detailing their grievances towards the company. In the absence of Governor Leicester P. Beaufort, Cook, petrified by the show of force, requested through a representative that Mat Salleh and the others tender their petition in a formal manner and instructed them to disperse. There was a delay in relating this message and Cook‚Äôs request only reached Mat Salleh after he had waited for two days. They were however, away on another expedition. Treasurer-in-general Alexander Cook, who was aware of their visit instead denied them an audience. After two days of waiting, Mat Salleh and his party left and headed back Following this, a complaint against Mat Salleh and his party was forwarded to the governor and other colonial officials by Cook. In response, on 29 August 1895, representatives from the Company arrived at Mat Salleh‚Äôs home in Jambongan to arrest him and four of his followers on the grounds of disturbing the peace at Sandakan and involvement with the murders of the two Ibans in 1894. Mat Salleh refused to comply and escaped. This led to his house and village being attacked, burned and looted. The company then announced him as a wanted man. A Straits $500 rewardOther accounts state that the reward was Straits $700. was offered for his capture. This incident triggered him to wage war against the British. He then consolidated his position at Lingkabau, approximately 50 miles up the Sugut river and with strong support from the native Dusun community there, built a strong fort. The British subsequently attacked it but failed to capture him. Instead, they destroyed it and apprehended about 60 Dusun natives. After this, he re- established himself in Labuk and built his headquarters at Limbawan. He had received support from the Labuk people as well. In September 1896, the British made another attack, surrounding Limbawan and cutting off possible escape routes. Again, they failed to apprehend him and also destroyed this fort. Following their escape, Mat Salleh and his followers built another fort at Padang at Ulu Sugut. =1897 (Gaya attack)= At midnight on 9 July 1897, Mat Salleh successfully led his followers to attack the Company‚Äôs settlement on Gaya Island. They raided and torched the Gaya compound before escaping with loot estimated to be worth Straits $100,000. They also took hostage F. S. Neubronner, the treasury clerk. The success of this attack increased his reputation as a local hero. This helped to further widen his reach, influence and support. After this attack, the Company proceeded to seek compensation from the Brunei Sultanate. The Managing Director, Cowie and the Governor, L. P. Beaufort, visited the Sultan of Brunei seeking compensation, claiming that some of the attackers were from regions under his jurisdiction. These areas were also claimed to have had been used as bases by Mat Salleh. The negotiations brought the Mengkabong, Manggatal and Api-Api districts (opposite of Gaya Island) under the Company's administration. After the successful attack on Gaya Island, Mat Salleh and his followers moved on to a fort on the Soan on the Labuk, then Parachangan on the Sugut, then proceeded to attack and burn down the government residency at Ambong in November 1897. Following this, he established his next fort at Ranau. On 13 December 1897, the Company attacked this Fort. They were defeated and lost about 10 men, including an Officer Jones, who had led the attack. On 9 January 1898, they attacked the fort for a second time with a bigger troop and captured it. However, by then, Mat Salleh and his men had already abandoned the fort and established a new one in the interior of Tambunan. The Tambunan fort was stronger and more stable than his previous fort. It was reported to have been This was also the last fort he used for defence in his struggle to rebel against the British. =1898 (Palatan Peace Pact)= Oath Stone erected by the Company in January 1898 \\"as witness of the oaths of loyalty\\" taken by Mat Salleh, his followers and other Ranau natives after a peace pact was agreed on mandau, which he had surrendered to Cowie as a symbolic act of his acknowledgement of the North Borneo Chartered Company's authority after the peace agreements. In some accounts, Cowie had then \\"graciously\\" returned it to Mat Salleh as a gesture of their friendly terms. The tit-for-tat dual reached deadlock by early 1898. Cowie, managing director to the court of directors of the British North Borneo Chartered Company, personally travelled from London to arrange peace talks and a peace pact with Mat Salleh (the Palatan Peace Pact). Simultaneously, the Sultan of Sulu wrote a letter to Dayang Bandung, Mat Salleh‚Äôs wife, urging a peace settlement with Cowie. The meeting occurred at Kampung Palatan in Ulu Menggatal on 19 April 1898. Mat Salleh was offered a pardon if resistance ceased. Cowie verbally promised amnesty and to allow Mat Salleh to settle in the Tambunan Valley, pledging noninterference from the government. Mat Salleh acceded and offered to accept it on two conditions: * The release of his imprisoned men; and, * That he be allowed to stay at Inanam. Cowie refused these conditions, permitting Mat Salleh only to stay in Tambunan or parts of the interior excluding Sugut and Lambuk, his former strongholds. In addition, Cowie made an additional promise that if Mat Sallah kept his peace for twelve consecutive months and cooperated with the Company, Cowie would recommend Mat Sallah to the court of directors for an appointment as chief or headman of a district. On 20 April 1898, Cowie, governor L.P Beufort and two officers (P. Wise and A. Terms) met with Mat Salleh again and this time, he was allowed \\"to live in the interior and take charge of the Tambunan district\\". With this, a ceremony was held to mark Mat Salleh‚Äôs official possession of the Menggatal River on 22 April 1898. The next day, on 23 April 1898, the Company sent an official document to Mat Salleh to sign. The document stated that: * Mat Salleh and his men were to be pardoned except those remaining in prison and those who had previously escaped; * Mat Salleh could stay in Tambunan or elsewhere within the interior except the Sugut and Labuk rivers; * That he was to report to the district officer on occasions he visited the coastIn some accounts, there was a discrepancy between the verbal and written agreement. Only when the written agreement was sent did Mat Salleh realise that he had been denied the pardon of his men who were escaped felons. Mat Salleh felt deceived and began to secretly strengthen his position in Tambunan. =1899= Mat Salleh and his allies were at war with the Taiwan communities. The latter approached the Company with urgent appeals for its intervention. This led to the governor, Beaufort, on 15 January 1899, visiting the Tiawan villages and obtaining an oath of allegiance from them. This was also, apparently, a strategic move by the Company.In the process of building a telegraph line, two new stations were established in the interior: one at Sapong in 1895 and another at Keningau in 1896, each under the European officer. The appointment of F W. Fraser at district offices at Keningau in 1898 signalled the extension of company rule to Tambunan. to pursue its plans to establish an administrative centre in Tambunan. Seeing this as a breach of faith to their earlier agreement, Mat Salleh prepared to resume resistance against the Company. In December 1899, R. M. Little, the resident of Labuan, was instructed to initiate negotiations. Mat Salleh refused negotiations and demanded their withdrawal from Tambunan. They refused. Almost immediately after this, Mat Salleh and his followers resumed waging sporadic attacks. =1900‚Äì1905 (Mat Salleh's defeat)= Memorial Stone near Tambunan, Sabah, Malaysia, marking the former location of Mat Salleh's fort and also the place where he met his death in 1900 The Company sent a force to retaliate. They reached Tambunan 31 December 1899 and fighting commenced the next day. On 10 January 1900, the Village of Laland was lost to the Company. Mat Salleh lost 60 men. On 15 January 1900, the Company proceeded to acquire Taga villages and the fort of one of Mat Salleh‚Äôs chief lieutenants; Mat Sator was burned by shell-fire. They then cut the water supply to Mat Salleh‚Äôs fort by diverting the Pengkalian river to the Sensuran. On 27 January 1900, Mat Salleh‚Äôs own fort was seized and shelled continuously for the next four days. The seemingly impenetrable fort finally fell due to a massive onslaught by the Company, and with this, Mat Salleh's final defences were finally broken. On 31 January 1900, Mat Salleh was killed by shell-fire by mid-day.There are conflicting accounts for the date of Mat Salleh's death. Almost all sources state 31 January 1900, but there are a few that state 1 February 1900 A chance shot from a Maxim Gun had hit Mat Salleh in the left temple, killing him instantly.Some claim that Mat Salleh did not die during the Tambunan attack. In an interview conducted by a reporter from the Malaysian newspaper Bernama, Petrus Podtung Kuyog, 73, the grandson to one of Mat Salleh's followers strongly asserted that according to his grandmother, Giok's account; on 31 January 1900, Mat Salleh survived the attack and fled with his wife before going into hiding. His deputy was killed and was mistaken by the Company for Mat Salleh. Also killed in the battle were about 1000 of Mat Salleh‚Äôs followers who fought from the neighbouring villages of Lotud Tondulu, Piasau, Kitutud, Kepayan and Sunsuron. It was, however, another five years before the remnants of Mat Salleh‚Äôs men surrendered, were killed or captured by the Company, marking the end of the rebellion in 1905. Mat Salleh's memorial Mat Salleh Memorial near Tambunan, Sabah, Malaysia (demolished in 2015) The Mat Salleh memorial was opened in 1999 at the exact site where he was killed at Kampung Tibabar in Tambunan, as a tribute to remember Mat Salleh, who stood up and led a rebellion against the Company's rule. It was demolished in 2015. The memorial, which resembled a fort, was surrounded by a garden. It housed Mat Salleh's photograph and some photos of his weapons and paraphernalia from the rebellion he led. A bronze plaque, set apart some metres from the building, still stands there and reads: After the memorial was opened, The New Straits Times (9 Mar 2000) reported Sabah museum director and Tambunan local, Joseph Pounis Guntavid, as suggesting that the British had long bragged about putting down Mat Salleh‚Äôs rebellion against their rule and was quoted, ‚Äò\\"but a search and study on Mat Salleh‚Äôs actions strongly indicated that he was not a rebel but a warrior who went against foreign rule, fighting for North Borneo ‚Äòself-government‚Äô...Mat Salleh initiated patriotism that led the people to fight for self-rule until Sabah gained her independence through Malaysia on 16 September 1963\\". Mat Salleh, however, is not always seen as a hero. Many writers of this rebellion see Mat Salleh as a lone crusader and / or an opportunist solely interested in restoring his precolonial social position of power. To the British, he was a rebel and troublemaker, but to his supporters, he was and still is a warrior.

He also heads the sanctioning body of TWC, the Global Traditional Wing Chun Kung Fu Association (GTWCKFA). Cheung is responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to his master Ip Man when they were teenagers in Hong Kong. Early life In the 1950s Cheung grew up in Kowloon, where fighting skills were considered a measure of self-worth and pride, At age 11, Cheung's challenge matches were on the school playground and his fighting style was Tai Chi Chuan, which was not sufficient to elevate him among the youth of Hong Kong. This fighting was a concern and frowned upon by his father who was a police inspector; hence Cheung avoided becoming involved in gangs. By his teenage years however the challenge fights continued, and‚Äîas they are inextricably linked to extortion rackets of secret societies‚ÄîCheung's high-achieving family saw him as a source of embarrassment. A turning point in Cheung's life was when a gang leader who was undefeated in combat challenged an old man who was rumored to fight in a little‚Äìknown Kung Fu style of a woman. Cheung witnessed the challenge and watched as the thin old man who was Ip Man quickly defeated the gang leader. Impressed by the old man's skill, Cheung visited Ip Man and became his student. Over the next few months Cheung became a favorite of Ip Man and became a live‚Äìin student for 3 years, before leaving Hong Kong. During his time living with Ip Man, Cheung introduced a then 15‚Äìyear‚Äìold famous child actor, Bruce Lee, whom he first met at Lee's 9th birthday to Ip Man. Cheung and Lee became friends and training partners. After several months of training every day they both became more involved in street challenge fights until one day Cheung fought a triad leader and seriously wounded him. This prompted Cheung's father to send him away from Hong Kong to put him out of harm's way; however, the problems followed him, and he and his family decided that it was better for his safety to migrate to Australia to begin a new life. Accomplishments William Cheung's workshop for Anthony Arnett in Florida USA =Teaching accomplishments= After moving to Melbourne, Australia to teach Traditional Wing Chun professionally in 1973, Cheung established his Wing Chun studio in Melbourne's CBD. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, his studio attracts hundreds of new students each year. Cheung also trained students in the US, including some who became successful in their martial arts careers, such as Eric Oram who went on to train Robert Downey Jr. and Christian Bale in preparation for their Hollywood movie roles. He also trained Anthony Arnett who has been winning martial arts tournaments since 1974 and has won grand champion multiple times some of which were for 3 years and 6 years running in different tournament circuits. Rahsun Herkul, William Cheung and Brian Laroda =Martial arts= After being involved in duels with several triad members he had defeated in China, Cheung had reason to fear for his life, so he decided to migrate to Australia in 1957. On the way there an incident occurred when he was forced to fight more than 10 sailors who were set up by the triads that sought revenge. Cheung sustained several stab wounds from the fight as some of the men were armed. In 1984 Cheung set a world speed punching record of 8.3 punches per second at Harvard University in Boston. =Awards= *Black Belt Hall of Fame Award - Kung Fu Artist of the year 1983 *Inside Kung Fu Hall of Fame Award - Instructor of the year 1989 =Magazine front covers= Over a 28-year period Cheung has been featured on the front cover of 35 magazines between 1982 and 2010, the first being Inside Kung Fu in October 1982 and the most recent Martial Arts Illustrated in April 2010. Academia Cheung attained a Bachelor of Economics from the Australian National University, after graduating from secondary school in Hong Kong. Cheung is a certified Doctor of Chinese Medicine under the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria, and a member of the Australian Chinese Traditional Orthopaedics Association Inc.

It is a part of the Pontifical North American College, and served as its main campus from its founding in 1859 until the construction of a new campus on the Janiculum Hill in 1953. It also houses the Bishops' Office for United States Visitors to the Vatican. Site and architecture The facade of the Church of Our Lady of Humility is seen on the left of this view down the Via dell'Umilt√†. The buildings that currently make up the Pontifical North American College's Casa Santa Maria encompass a large area, trapezoidal in shape, giving on to the Via dell'Umilt√†, the Via dell'Archetto, the Vicolo del Monticello, and the Piazza della Pilotta. At first glance the buildings seem to be one single construction, but they are not; their external coherency is only the result of a fairly recent restructuring. To found the monastery that was originally housed on the site, multiple houses were purchased along the Via dell'Archetto. After the 1607 foundation date, additions to the property were made in 1641, 1681, and 1737. American College historian Robert McNamara describes the complex in 1859 as \\"a large building, rangy and haphazard in form, making no claim to distinction in style, but combining under one roof quarters easily adaptable to housing a hundred or more young seminarians.\\" Henry Brann, a historian of the American College, describes the building in the following terms (writing in 1910): History =Ancient Roman background= In ancient Roman times, the area in which the Casa Santa Maria is located was considered to be on a spur of the Quirinal Hill called the Mucialis. In the Middle Ages, before the construction of the church and convent that would eventually come to house the American College's seat in Rome, the area was covered with a complex of large Roman ruins popularly called the \\"Prison of Virgil.\\" In all likelihood, these would have been the remains of what modern archaeology has identified as the Quirinal Serapeum. Excavation works in 1947 revealed Roman ruins under the College chapel, but they cannot be authoritatively identified as belonging to the Serapeum; instead, they may be part of the Campus Agrippae or the Statio I Cohortium Vigilum. =From the Middle Ages to monastic foundation= By the Middle Ages the Roman structures mentioned above had fallen into decay. Nevertheless, before the founding of the monastery that would eventually become the Casa Santa Maria, a number of noble families moved into the area. One of these were the Orsini, from which the foundress of the monastery, Francesca Baglioni Orsini (c. 1540‚Äì1625) was descended. When her husband Francesco Orsini died in 1593, she refused to marry again. She returned to her native Rome from Florence, where she had worked as a governess of the princesses Eleanora and Maria de' Medici, and founded a monastery in which to live out the rest of her years. For that purpose, she purchased a block of buildings from Vincenzo Menichelli, \\"Cavaliere Romano,\\" for the sum of 6,500 scudi, and named it the Monastero dell'Umilt√† (Monastery of Humility). The convent's foundation was approved by Pope Paul V with the brief Inter universa of November 20, 1607. The cloister was solemnly dedicated and blessed on September 26, 1613. The convent took its first sisters from Dominican convents on the Quirinal, and the Rule of Saint Dominic was adopted for the house. All of the nuns of the Umilt√† monastery were to be of noble background. The foundress lived in rooms of her own, was not obliged by the rule, and did not wear the habit; nevertheless her contemporaries remarked on her virtue and holiness before her death in 1625. An inscription marking the room in which she died is still present in the Casa Santa Maria today. =Upheaval in the 19th century= The Dominican sisters of the Umilt√† maintained their convent for centuries, and were favorably noted for the strict observance of their rule. However, their tenure of the property was to come to an end as a result of Napoleon's campaigns in Italy. Although untouched during the invasion of Rome in 1798 and the temporary establishment of the Roman Republic, the eventual annexation of the Papal States to the French Empire led to the suppression of all convents and monasteries in the city on May 3, 1810. The house was taken over by the French government and the nuns evicted; while they sought refuge in other monasteries or left religious life, the convent was turned into a barracks for policemen. The return of Pope Pius VII to the city in 1814 meant the restoration of many convents in the city, but the Umilt√† sisters were never able to return to their home and the monastery became extinct. In turn, the convent was granted to the Visitation Sisters on August 14, 1814. They made some immediate changes to the monastery chapel, including installing an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe by Miguel Cabrera which had been gifted to them by Pope Benedict XIV in the mid 1700s. It remains in the chapel to this day. During the time of the Visitation sisters, the monastery was often visited by Don Vincenzo Pallotti, a future canonized saint. Just thirty five years after acquiring the property, however, the Visitandines were forced to leave their new home by compulsion of the revolutionary Roman Republic in 1849. On June 5, a commissar of the Republic appeared at the convent at six in the evening, informed the superior that the house was to be taken over, and the sisters were forced to leave within six hours. The complex was once again turned into a barracks, this time for the occupying French army that drove out the Republic. It remained in that use until 1854. =American College in Rome= Pope Pius IX, who used to serve Mass there as a boy, ensured that the American College received the Casa Santa Maria property in 1859. The old Visitation monastery passed into the hands of the American College thanks to the express will of Pope Pius IX, who used to serve Mass there for the Visitation sisters as a young boy. While other Colleges had been vying for its convenient location and spacious property, Pope Pius ensured that it would be given to the American College, whose founding had been a project of his own initiative. He even personally contributed the money to purchase the property. The new College was opened ceremonially on December 8, 1859, and the new foundation received a formal visit from the pope on January 29, 1860. The structure served as the main seat of the American College in Rome for almost a century. This changed as a result of the situation developing in Europe in 1940, when the American seminarians were forced to depart en masse on May 31 of that year. In the end, they had to complete their studies at various seminaries back in the United States. The property, while remaining in the possession of the bishops of the United States, was requisitioned for \\"charitable wartime employment\\" in 1943. Until mid-1947, it served as a home for displaced Italian children. Later that year, the property was returned to the use of the American College. Under the direction of Martin J. O'Connor, Rector of the College, a general restoration of the whole complex was begun. With the construction of a new and larger campus at Villa Gabrielli on the Janiculum, the buildings on Via dell'Umilt√† were rechristened the \\"Casa Santa Maria,\\" and set aside for the use of priests pursuing graduate studies at universities in Rome. That continues to be its primary function today. The history and devotional practices of the Dominican and Visitation nuns that once inhabited the building have affected the life of the American College. For example, a devotion to Our Lady of Humility has been adopted as the College's own, and certain privileged feasts of the nuns, such as the Visitandines' celebration of St. Francis de Sales, were always celebrated with special solemnity by the College as well. Another example relates to the fact that the declaration as Venerable (an early step in the process of canonization) of the Visitandine nun, later saint, Margaret Mary Alacoque, occurred in the Church of the Umilt√† in 1846. In recognition of that connection, Henry Brann was able to claim in 1910 that the American College was \\"inseparably associated with the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\\". Chapel of Our Lady of Humility The American College's chapel, the full name of which is Santa Maria Assunta al monastero dell‚ÄôUmilt√† (\\"Saint Mary of the Assumption at Humility Monastery\\"), was originally the church attached to the monastery founded by Francesca Baglioni Orsini. The cornerstone was laid on March 7, 1601. The original church, which was finished about a decade later, was entirely rebuilt between 1641 and 1646 and it is that second structure that rises on the site today. The architect was Paolo Maruscelli, a Florentine. Although some details of its decoration have changed throughout the centuries, \\"the victim of later, more elaborate and flamboyant tastes,\\" the architectural plan and basic structure remain the same today. A notable later addition is the highly ornate carved wooden organ loft, the work of Sebastiano Moroni in 1735. The church is vaulted, and lighted by four windows above a large cornice. That cornice, in turn, is supported by twelve pilasters, six on a side. There are four chapels in the church in addition to the main tribune. The main altar houses a tabernacle made from sardonyx agate, over which used to be placed an image of Our Lady of Humility by Pietro Perugino. That image, however, was lost sometime before 1814. When the chapel was transferred to the newly-formed American College, Archbishop Gaetano Bedini substituted it with a copy of the image of Our Lady of Mercy that is venerated in Rimini. This image is enclosed in an amethyst frame surrounded by a bas relief of four angels in gilded bronze. Two angels in white marble support the frame. The whole main altar was the work of Martino Longhi the Younger, who completed the work between 1643 and 1646. Sometime around 1859, it was moved away from the wall and raised to a higher level. Between the pilasters are six stucco statues of female saints: Cecilia, Catherine, Barbara, Agatha, Ursula, and Agnes. These statues are the work of Antonio Raggi and were sculpted and put in place between 1663 and 1674. The church's exterior facade is said to be the work of Carlo Fontana, even if that cannot be established for certain. In any case, it no longer appears today as it did at the time of its completion. When the monastery was handed over to the Americans by Pope Pius IX, the architect Andrea Busiri built a storey above the church, which altered the facade by substituting a Neoclassical pediment in place of Fontana's Baroque one. Extensive restoration work was completed on the church in 1947, when the property was returned to the use of the American College following World War II. Notable improvements to the chapel included a new marble floor executed in the color rosso di Francia, cleaning of the frescoes in the vault, and retouching of the stucco figures around the sanctuary. The Casa S. Maria today =Graduate house of the Pontifical North American College= As home to the graduate department of the Pontifical North American College, the Casa Santa Maria provides a residence and community for priests pursuing graduate studies at a variety of universities, institutes, and academic programs in the city of Rome. In 2015, the Casa housed seventy-two student priests, representative of forty-two dioceses in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The previous superior of the house was Monsignor Ferdinando Berardi of the Archdiocese of New York. The current superior of Casa Santa Maria is the Reverend James J. Conn, SJ JD, JCD of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus. =Bishops' Office for United States Visitors to the Vatican= The Visitors' Office at the Casa Santa Maria is an initiative sponsored jointly by both the North American College and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and staffed by the Religious Sisters of Mercy of Alma, Michigan. The Office exists to assist pilgrims from the United States in planning a journey to Rome, assisting with requests for papal audience tickets, tours of the catacombs and the Vatican Necropolis, and requests for papal blessings.

They were one of the top acts of the former Yugoslav rock scene, and currently one of the top rock-and-roll bands in Croatia. Biography Parni valjak was founded in 1975 in Zagreb. Unlike many rock bands that would come later, their style was becoming more mainstream, becoming closer to pop, especially compared with the bands like Prljavo kazali≈°te or Film. As years went by, their refusal to change style proved to be the important factor in the band's longevity. They kept a loyal following in 1980s and in 1990s, refusing to allow elements of folk and turbo folk music to become part of their repertoire. Because of that the band enjoys great respect among many Croatian rock critics, being seen as the embodiment of \\"true\\" rock and urban culture and many of their songs are considered evergreens in the former Yugoslavia like \\"Sve jo≈° miri≈°e na nju\\", \\"Jesen u meni\\", \\"Ugasi me\\" and \\"Zastave\\". Parni valjak kept a relatively small but dedicated following for 30 years, and many people tend to gather at their concerts that feature energetic performances, despite advanced age of the band's members: Aki Rahimovski - vocals, Husein Hasanefendiƒá-Hus - guitars, Marijan Brkiƒá Brk - guitars, Berislav Bla≈æeviƒá- Bero - keyboards, Zvonimir Buƒçeviƒá-Buƒç - bass guitar, Dra≈æen Scholz-≈†olc - drums, Tina Rupƒçiƒá - vocal, Anita Mlinariƒá - sax. In December 2005, Parni valjak made a farewell tour of Croatia and Slovenia on their 30th birthday. Their last public performance in 2005 was a concert on New Year's Eve in Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square in Zagreb, though they stated that more concerts may be held in future. In November 2009, they began a reunion tour in Croatia. In October 2010, Parni valjak held a 2 concerts at Belgrade Arena, Belgrade that was followed with great public turnout (more than 44,000 people in 2 days).http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/431/Muzika/780896/Arena+uhvatila+ritam+%E2%80%9EParnog+valjka%E2%80%9C.html The band in a concert in ƒåakovec (2016) Discography =Albums= # Doƒëite na show! - 1976 (\\"Come to the show!\\") # Glavom kroz zid - 1977 (\\"Head through the wall\\") # Gradske priƒçe - 1979 (\\"City stories\\") # City kids - Steam Roller - 1980 (the band's only album sung entirely in English) # Vruƒáe igre - 1980 (\\"Hot games\\") # Vrijeme je na na≈°oj strani - 1981 (\\"Time is on our side\\") # Glavnom ulicom - 1983 (\\"Down the main street\\") # Uhvati ritam - 1984 (\\"Catch the beat\\") # Pokreni se! - 1985 (\\"Move yourself!\\") # Anƒëeli se dosaƒëuju? - 1987 (\\"The angels are bored?\\") # Sjaj u oƒçima - 1988 (\\"Shine in the eyes\\") # Lovci snova - 1990 (\\"The dream catchers\\") # Buƒëenje - 1993 (\\"Waking up\\") # Samo snovi teku uzvodno - 1997 (\\"Only dreams flow upstream\\") # Zastave - 2000 (\\"Flags\\") # Prete≈æno sunƒçano? - 2004 (\\"Mostly sunny?\\") # Stvarno nestvarno - 2011 (\\"Real unreal\\") # Nema predaje - 2013 (\\"No surrender\\") # Vrijeme - 2018 (\\"Time\\") =Live albums= # Koncert (LIVE) - 1982 (\\"Concert\\") # E = mc2 (LIVE) - 1985 # Svih 15 godina - LIVE... - 1990 (\\"All 15 years\\") # Bez struje - LIVE in ZeKaeM - 1995 (\\"Unplugged: Live from the ZeKaeM\\") # Kao nekada - LIVE at S.C. - 2001 (\\"As once - Live from Student Center\\") =DVDs= # 25 godina; 2001 (\\"25 years\\") # Bez struje - LIVE in ZekaeM (DVD+CD) - 2005 (\\"Unplugged: Live from the ZeKaeM\\") =VHS= # Koncert; 1988 (\\"Concert\\") =Singles= # Parni valjak\\" / \\"≈†izofrenik\\", Alta/PGP RTB, 1976. # Tako proƒëe tko ne pazi kad ga Parni valjak zgazi/Dok si mlad, PGP RTB, 1976. # Ljubavni jadi jednog Parnog valjka/Te≈°ko je biti sam, PGP RTB, 1976. # Prevela me mala/O ≈°umama, rijekama i pticama, PGP RTB, 1976. # Oƒáu da se ≈æenim/Ljeto, Jugoton, 1977. # Lutka za bal/Crni dani, Jugoton, 1977. # Od motela do motela/Predstavi je kraj, CBS/Suzy, 1978. # Stranica dnevnika/Uliƒçne tuƒçe, Jugoton, 1979. # Ugasi me/Ugasi me(instrumental), Jugoton, 1985. # Kekec je slobodan, red je na nas (single) - 1992 # Ka≈æi ja!/Sai Baba blues/Ka≈æi ja!

Its meanings are many. The Lotus with Soul Ayyavazhi and Hinduism are two belief systems in India. Although Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a Hindu denomination, members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction between Hinduism and Ayyavazhi is their different approaches to the concepts of good, evil and dharma. Hindus view Vedas, Gita, and other texts from the Shastra as canonical scriptures, instead of the Akilam. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. Kaliyan bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including Agamas and Puranas lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about Venneesan \\"Avan pilathaal vedamondruntakki\\" (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world. Though Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to Smartism and its Advaita beliefs in thought.  Differences specific to Ayyavazhi  = Religious Practices = The religious practises of Ayyavazhi largely differ from traditional Hinduism. Akilam says that previous practices were not wrong, but that they were distorted because of the abnormal, cruel nature of Kaliyan and his boons, which the Universe had experienced before. Akilattirattu Ammanai says that the whole acts and rules of the Universe had changed by the advent of Kaliyan. Thiru Nadana Ula, a part of Akilam eight discusses this change in detail.  Wearing of Thirunamam  The Ayyavazhi people use a unique religious mark. The vertical white mark is worn on the forehead in the shape of a flame, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, and rising to the top edge of the forehead. The flame shape represents Aanma Jyothi or Atman. Zealous devotees smear it on the exterior of the upper arms and over the chest. This white mark is unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavist tradition, worn on the forehead in the shape of a 'U', or of Saivist tradition who wear it horizontally as three parallel lines. The white powder used for this mark was made from coarse white soil, found at lower layer of the earth, while ash is used in Hinduism. At present, those who 'serve' in Pathis or Nizhal Thangals wear this white mark for the people and give a portion of it to their hands. People carry it home as a holy object, and some of them even swallow a little of it believing it to be medicinal.  Wearing of Headgear  One of the significant ritual actions that distinguishes Ayyavazhi male worshipper from others is 'wearing headgear' during worship. Ayya Vaikundar seems to have enjoined his male followers to tie on headgear when they came to worship God, considering it as a crown. Accordingly, the male followers tied on headgear during worship. This is to reveal that every person is a king and every one is to rule the Earth. This philosophy is told symbolically by the practice of wearing the headgear. It was a counteraction to the practice of tying a cloth around the waist, which symbolizes bondage. It became a ritual action to be performed before entering the Pathi to worship. Male devotees usually removed their upper garment and tied the headgear before entering the Pathi. To this day this practice is followed.  Worship in Front of Mirror  The Nizhal Thangals and Pathis have, in their sanctuary, a mirror to reflect the images worshippers. People pay obeisance to their God standing in front of this mirror, facing the Elunetru amidst two oil lamps. Even in the houses of the people of Ayyavazhi, the place earmarked for their daily worship has at least a mirror and a lamp. The mirror's placement symbolizes that God is inside oneself and it is of no use to seek God elsewhere. This practice is different from the placement of murti, or icon in Hindu Temples, in that this is a non- anthropomorphic form of worship. In different denominations of Hinduism, Saivites venerate the linga and Vaishnavites venerate the saligrama in a non- anthropomorphic form of worship. A New mode of Worship The Ayyavazhi mode of worship was new in that milieu. It distinguished itself from the Sanskrit religion and folk religions. Instructions for abandoning temple worship, temple offerings, priestly functions, blood sacrifices and image worship abound in Akilam. Unlike some practices in Hinduism, it says, \\"Do not institute Temples, Do not offer puja, blood sacrifices, do not kill animals, do not worship images made of Clay\\" etc.  A Distinct Language  The Tamil language is considered sacred, rather than Sanskrit, as is holy within mainstream Hinduism. In Akilam there is a quote that Tamil will be the language in Dharma Yukam. Also unlike other Hindu scriptures in Tamil, Akilattirattu and Arul Nool were written using a simple form of language. Extracts from ancient Hindu scriptures are found in it, translated simply, so that common people could understand. = Beliefs = A few beliefs of Ayyavazhi are different from Hinduism.  Vaikunda Avatar  Ayyavazhi believes Vaikundar is the incarnation of Narayana in this Kali Yukam, sent to destroy the evils of Kali yuga. Hindus accept Kalki rather than Vaikundar as the Incarnation who will be sent to destroy such evil. Also, Hindus believe that the spirit of Kali yuga has yet to be destroyed, but Ayyavazhi says that the spirit of Kali Yuga started its decline immediately after the Avatar of Vaikundar arrived. This was due to the torture of a Pantaram (Vaikundar), who was tortured because he had promised to Thirumal that he would not harm any Pantaram. Eight Yukams Regarding Yukams, Ayyavazhi believes in a system of Eight Yukams while Hinduism suggests a system of four Yugas (Yukams).  Kroni  Ayyavazhi believes in a primordial manifestation of evil Kroni similar to Satan in Abrahamic Religions, while Hinduism has no personification of Evil.  Trimurthi  The view on Trimurti (three aspects of Brahman) is similar to Smartism, which like Ayya Vazhi, recognizes that Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are different aspects of the same God. By contrast, for example, in Saivism, Sivan (the Tamil name for Siva) is considered superior while in Vaishnavism Vishnu is considered superior. In Ayyavazhi the three were considered equal in all the previous six Yukams. But only in Kali Yukam are all the powers surrendered to Narayana by Sivan and Nathan because Kaliyan was created by them without discussion with Narayana. Regarding Vaikunda Avatharam, Ayya Vaikundar is superior to the three because the Moolamoorthy or Paramathma, superior to Trimuthi is that who incarnates as Vaikundar, but in Hinduism Vishnu incarnates. However Vishnu was the first to form in this Universe within the three according to Akilam.  Dharma Yukam  Ayyavazhi believes in a Dharma Yukam where Vaikundar rules the world with the Santror Makkal. In Hinduism they believe in Satya Yuga which does not mention Vaikundar.  Unifying the Deities  In Ayyavazhi, Vaikundar performed symbolic marriages by which he unified all the powers of the universe into himself and so all were seen as one, which is similar to the beliefs of Smartism. But in other branches of Hinduism, they acknowledge different powers as superior and may worship different powers in different forms. = Sociology =  Congregational Worship  Amongst the Ayyavazhi, congregational worship is practiced, while in Hinduism the Priest chants the mantras and performs rituals, and the devotees watch. But in Ayyavazhi the Panivediyalar chants the mantras and the others repeat it.  Thottu Namam  In Ayyavazhi Thottu Namam means \\"wearing Thirunamam with a personal touch\\", which means the Panivedaiyalar will bestow the Thirunamam by touching the forehead of the devotees. But in Hinduism the Priests gives the Prachatham by throwing, in the belief that if he happened to touch the worshipers body it would make him ritually unclean. In olden days this was practiced because the Brahmins kept a distance from the other castes. This \\"Thottu Namam\\" was an intentional counteraction of this ancient Hindu tradition, put forward by Ayyavazhi.  Ayyavazhi Marriage  Unlike the traditional Hindu way of marriage, Ayyavazhi does not have many ritual practices. But it also differs in marriage as a whole. In Ayyavazhi the couple was seated facing the geographic south witnessing the Thuvaraiyam Pathi in the Indian Ocean. In addition to the priest, all the people who witness the marriage chant the mantras, and praise the couple following the priest, while in Hinduism this was done only by the Priest.  Funeral practice  In Ayyavazhi, unlike in Hinduism, the body of the dead is buried. Generally, Hinduism mandates cremation and limits burial to monks and children under five. The body is buried in a position that faces the geographic north in a Padmasana position. No boxes such as coffins are used. The body is placed inside and covered by sand or Namam (sacred soil). This practice is done with the belief that the deceased is performing austerity for the unfolding of Dharma Yukam. There was also a belief that the body of a person who was free from birth will not decay, and will be preserved as it is. Then as the Dharma Yukam unfolds, Vaikundar will blow a Conch shell and these people will rise from the grave. This scenario resembles the Last Judgment in the Abrahamic religions. The practice of burial is strikingly similar to funeral practices, in Lingayatism, a reform movement in Karnataka, like Ayyavazhi, which was critical of the caste system. Unlike Ayyavazhi, Lingyatism focuses on Shiva as the supreme God. Similarities between Ayyavazhi and Hinduism = Religious Practices =  Dress during worship  Like Hinduism the male worshippers of Ayyavazhi do not wear any upper garments during worship. Footwear is prohibited in worship centers. Also in Ayyavazhi, the female worshippers do not go to worship centers during the period of Menses, like other Hindus.  Circumambulation  The practice of circumambulation is quite commonly seen in Ayyavazhi as in Hinduism. In Ayyavazhi the devotees use to take a bath and circumambulate the outer Pathi and then the inner Pathi and then the sanctum sanatorium.  Saffron  Saffron is considered as sacred in Ayyavazhi as in its father religion, Hinduism. All the Panividaiyalars (those who perform Panividai) in Pathis and Nizhal Thangals dress in a saffron dothi and saffron headgear which are collectively known as Kavi Vasthiram. This is also the colour of the flag that is to be hoisted in Pathis, as told as Chandiravarnam, and is the colour of the Ayyavazhi flags hoisted over their temples.  Rudraksha  Like Hinduism, and particularly Saivism Ayyavazhi consider Rudraksha to be sacred.  Theertham  Like Hinduism, Ayyavazhi stress Theertham. But according to Ayyavazhi, Muttirikkinaru and Muttappathi were considered most sacred. = Theology =  Ultimate Oneness  Ayyavazhi like the Advaita tradition within Hinduism accepts the Ultimate Oneness, which is akin to the concept of Brahman. It says that the universe formed from the Ekam. Thiruvasakam - 2 describes the formation of this present Universe. Like Advaita, it believes that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are different aspects of the same God.  Incarnation  Just as Mahaprabhu Caitanya was thought of as an incarnation of Vishnu (and more specifically of Krishna) in Gaudiya Vaishnavism so too is Ayya Vaikundar thought to be an incarnation of Vishnu. It is believed that God incarnates Himself to educate his children on obtaining union with Him.  Reincarnation  Ayyavazhi, like Hinduism, believes in reincarnation. It states that all lives are continually reborn until they reach Dharma Yukam, the state of Moksha.  Karma  Ayyavazhi disciples believe in the law of karma and that practicing good karma will grant them Moksha. The practice of good karma leads the devotee to God.  Moksha  Moksha is the goal of Ayyavazhi. The Ayyavazhi disciple believes like other Hindus that this too is a union with God in which the soul achieves perfect Shanti (\\"peace\\") and Swarga (\\"heaven.\\")  Ahimsa  Ahimsa is Sanskrit for \\"non-violence\\" and the Ayyavazhi accept this principle.  Vegetarianism  The Ayyavazhi believe in the vegetarian principle, which is an important aspect of Ahimsa. Ayya Vaikundar is considered an incarnation of Vishnu and in Vaishnavism, meat-eating is forbidden.  Chanting of the Lord's name  This principle (known in Sanskrit as Sankirtana Yajna) is an essential sacrifice especially for this age. It is believed that chanting the name of the Lord is an auspicious way to worship.  God is inside everybody  In Hinduism it is believed that the spirit of God is present within the heart of every human. The Ayyavazhi too believe that God is present within humans.  Final Judgement  In the Ayyavazhi tradition, it is believed that in the final judgement, the demon will be sentenced to hell while Vaikundar and Santror will rule the world. In Hinduism also it is believed that God Vishnu will incarnate Himself to destroy this age of hypocrisy.  Sanskrit  Although the Ayyvazhi prefer local language rather than Sanskrit, devotees name their children in Sanskrit (e.g. Vaikunar, Krishna, Narayan.)

Early life He was born in Ilford in the London Borough of Redbridge. Writing He wrote a television play, Yesterday's Enemy, which he later turned into a screenplay for Val Guest; the film version was released in 1959 by Hammer. As a three-act play, it was published by Samuel French in 1960. He was commissioned for further screenplays, but the relationship between Newman and Hammer deteriorated over financial concerns. His Western screenplay, The San Siado Killings, would become the basis for the 1961 Eurowestern film Savage Guns. The final film, one of the first Spaghetti Westerns, was credited to Edmund Morris. It was also the first western to be shot on location in Almeria, Spain, an area which would be often used in later Spaghetti Westerns during the next two decades. He wrote The Sensorites for the first season of Doctor Who in 1963‚Äì64. This would be Newman's only contribution to Doctor Who, and indeed his last credit for British television. He subsequently developed severe writer's block and took a job as a porter at the Tate Gallery. Personal life In an attempt to join the army before he was of age, Newman fled his school and exchanged clothes with a deserter he subsequently met, not knowing at the time that the soldier was a deserter. This resulted in some trouble with the police, who sought out his family under the belief that it was Newman who had deserted. Unable to return to school as he was expelled, he did eventually join the army legally and was deployed to Burma, where he met and befriended a Japanese soldier. It is likely his experiences there greatly influenced his writing in both Yesterday's Enemy and The Sensorites.\\"Looking for Peter\\" the official BBC DVD of \\"The Sensorites\\" Death He died in 1975 after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage following an accident at work in which he fell down a flight of stairs and hit his head on an iron radiator.\\"Looking for Peter\\" the official BBC DVD of \\"The Sensorites\\" References External links * Category:1926 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Ilford Category:British television writers Category:British science fiction writers Category:British male screenwriters Category:English television writers Category:English screenwriters Category:English male screenwriters Category:British male television writers Category:20th-century British screenwriters ","title":"Peter R.

Soft security can refer to immediate security measures, such as silent burglar alarms or motion detectors, but often refers to more elaborate social security systems such as the \\"moral network\\" in a tightly-knit community ‚Äî for example, a cluster of friends on a busy city street. The term has gained widespread use in wiki communities, notably MeatballWiki. The differentiation between \\"soft security\\" and \\"hard security\\" was first made by Rasmusson and Jansson who used the term hard security for traditional mechanisms like authentication and access control, and soft security for social control mechanisms. There is a difference between the related concepts of quality control and soft security. Soft security attempts to discourage harm and mitigate any damage, while quality control attempts to improve a product and weed out non-conforming output. The social controls on the production of Wikipedia documents demonstrate both principles, using discussion pages, accessible edit histories, policies and guidelines, in contrast to traditional document control mechanisms such as workflow and authorization, to achieve both soft security and quality control. In commercial security, soft security is often achieved through training of staff to manage the environment (1) to make disruptions more noticeable, (2) to make disruptions less socially acceptable, and (3) to create a perceived vested interest in the public.

Atomic Shelter) is a Croatian and former Yugoslav hard rock band, formed in Pula in 1977. The band is known primarily for its strong anti-war lyrics.Atomsko skloni≈°te at DiscogsRadio Free Europe: Rokom protiv turbo folka (Rock'n'Roll vs. Turbo Folk), by Omer Karabeg, 14.03.2009Atomsko skloni≈°te home page: \\"IZ SVEG SRCA\\", Interview with Bruno Langer History =1977-1987= The band's history begins in 1968, when a play titled Atomsko skloni≈°te and directed by Bo≈°ko Obradoviƒá premiered in People's Theatre in Pula. The play featured a choice of the world anti-war poetry, including two of Obradoviƒá's poems: Kuga u Danangu (against Vietnam War) and Vaclavske Namjesti (against Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia). For several years Obradoviƒá had an idea of a rock band performing songs featuring his lyrics, and in 1977, in front of the kafana Jadran in Pula, which was a gathering place for local musicians, he offered his lyrics to a group of musicians. The agreement was soon made, and the band Atomsko Skloni≈°te was officially formed on February 26, 1977. The first lineup of the band featured Bruno Langer (a former Beat Stones, Fantomi, Logaritmi, and Boomerang member, bass guitar), Sergio Bla≈æiƒá (vocals), Dragan Gu≈ævan (guitar), Eduard Kancelar (keyboards), Sa≈°a Dadiƒá (drums), and Rudolf Grum (backing vocals). Bla≈æiƒá, Gu≈ævan and Dadiƒá previously performed together in the band Hush. The made their first success with a performance on the 1977 BOOM Festival in Novi Sad. In the spring of 1978 they performed at Festival Omladina, and during the same year their debut album Ne cvikaj, generacijo (Don't Be Afraid, My Generation) was released. The album featured hard rock sound, with anti-war and cataclysmic lyrics, heavily inspired by hippie ideology, which even in Yugoslavia had already been discarded. The album brought hits \\"Pomorac sam, majko\\", \\"Kinematograf na≈°eg detinjstva\\" and \\"Ne cvikaj, generacijo\\". The band gained the publics attention with the statements that they perform punk, unusual clothing style and photographs made by the photographer Tone Stojko from Maribor. The band would later record music for the song \\"Zaspao si u mojoj kosi\\", released by Stojko's wife Neca Falk. The band's second album, Infarkt (Heart Attack) was released with a book of photographs by Stojko, and featured hits \\"Pakleni vozaƒçi\\" and \\"Djevojka br. 8\\". After the album release Kancelar left the band due to his studies, and was replaced by Paul Biƒçand≈æiƒá. The band maintained their popularity on their live appearances which featured unusual scenery, such as barbed wire, and during a concert in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana there were three hundred yellow umbrellas opened above the stage, referring to the band's song \\"≈Ωuti ki≈°obran\\" (Yellow Umbrella). The band gained a loyal fanbase, although the critics generally did not like the lyrics written by Obradoviƒá. The band recorded their third album U vremenu horoskopa (During the Time of Horoscope) on the peninsula Stoja near Pula, in the Mobile One mobile studio, previously used by AC/DC. The album was produced by John Etchells and Bill Ainsworth. At the time Biland≈æiƒá left the band ant formed the band Lilihip, and Atomsko skloni≈°te continued as a quartet. In 1980 the band recorded the live album Atomska trilogija (Nuclear Trilogy) on a concert in Dom JNA in Pula. In 1981 they released their fourth studio album Extrauterina (Ectopic Pregnancy), recorded with Etchells and Ainsworth as the producers in the Super Bear Studio, located in a monastery in the French Alps, and previously used by Elton John, Kate Bush, Pink Floyd, and Van Morrison. The album featured the band's new drummer Zdravko ≈†irola. After the album was released the band ended their cooperation with Bo≈°ko Obradoviƒá. Langer became the band leader and the songwriter. In 1982 the band released the album Mentalna higijena (Mental Hygiene), recorded at the JAM Studio in London. The album featured Mel Collins on saxophone as a guest. During the same year the band went to Florida, where they recorded the album Space Generation for the foreign market. The album featured nine old Atomsko skloni≈°te songs with English language lyrics written by Dra≈æen Met Premet. The band released the album through EEC under the name Atomic Shelter. In 1984 the band released the album Zabranjeno snivanje (Forbidden Dreaming). The live album Jednom u ≈æivotu (Once in a Lifetime), recorded on the concert held at Ta≈°majdan Stadium on September 15, 1984, and released in 1985, was the last album featuring Bla≈æiƒá on vocals. The band had the last performance with him on July 21, 1986, after which he died on January 18, 1987. In 1986 Langer and Gu≈ævan recorded the English language album This Spaceship and released it under the name Atomic Shelter. The album featured American musicians Wes Talton (vocals), Freddie Stuckey (keyboards) and David Pressley (drums). The album featured six old rerecorded Atomsko skloni≈°te songs and four new songs. =1987-present= At the end of 1987 Atomsko skloni≈°te continued performing in the new lineup: Langer (vocals and bass guitar), Ranko Svorcan (guitar) and Nikola Durakoviƒá (drums). In 1990 the band released the album Criminal Tango. In August 1991, at the time when military conflicts in Yugoslavia had already begun, Atomsko skloni≈°te performed on Gitarijada festival in Zajeƒçar, Serbia. In 1992 the band released the album East Europe Man, featuring Wes Talon on vocals. The song \\"Chinese Bike\\" entered the 'Billboard Hot 100. In 1995 the band released the studio album Terra Mistica. In 1999 Nikola Durakoviƒá was replaced by Stjepan Bobiƒá (a former Nola, The Spoons, and Messerschmitt member). In 2003 One Records released the DVD entitled Atomsko skloni≈°te, which features a collection of their videos and a recording of their performance at the 1991 Gitarijada festival. Legacy The album Ne cvikaj, generacijo was polled in 1998 as 47th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav popular music albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music).

He was a pastor and spiritual father of high reputation and a reputed wonderworker to whom were attributed great powers of prophecy, clairvoyance and healing. He is often referred to simply as \\"St. John the Wonderworker\\". Life Born in 1896 in the village of Adamovka of the Izyumsky Uyezd of the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire (in present-day eastern Ukraine). He came from the same family of Serbian origin as that of St. John of Tobolsk, whom he was said to resemble in several respects. Growing up he was a sickly child who was deeply devout to his religion and used to collect icons and church books. He was captivated by the lives of saints, even in play he would turn toy soldiers into monks and fortresses into monasteries. His piousness has impressed his French caretaker so much that she converted from catholicism to orthodox christianity. From 1907 to 1914 he attended Poltava Military School. He received a degree in law from Kharkov Imperial University in 1918. His family brought him to Belgrade in 1921, where in 1925 he graduated from Belgrade University with a degree in theology.\\"Archbishop John, Wonder-worker of shanghai and San Francisco\\", Holy Virgin Cathedral, San Francisco In 1926 he was tonsured a monk and ordained a hierodeacon by Russian Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky), who gave him the name of St. John after his saintly relative. Later that same year, he was ordained to the priesthood by Russian Bishop Gabriel (Chepur) of Chelyabinsk. For several years afterward he worked as an instructor and tutor in Yugoslavia. He worked as a religious teacher in the Gymnasium of Velika Kikinda between 1925 and 1927. In 1929, Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church appointed him a teacher of the seminary in Bitola. The principal of the seminary was Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá. In 1934 he was ordained a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia by Metropolitan Anthony and assigned to the diocese of Shanghai.Metropolitan Anthony of Kiev and Galicia (1863-1936) =Shanghai= In Shanghai, Holy Bishop St. John found an uncompleted cathedral and an Orthodox community deeply divided along ethnic lines. Making contact with all the various groups, he quickly involved himself in the existing charitable institutions and personally founded an orphanage and home for the children of indigents. Here he first became known for miracles attributed to his prayer. As a public figure it was impossible for him to completely conceal his ascetic way of life. Despite his actions during the Japanese occupation, even when he routinely ignored the curfew in pursuit of his pastoral activities, the Japanese authorities never harassed him. As the only Russian hierarch in China who refused to submit to the authority of the Soviet-dominated Russian Orthodox Church, he was elevated to Archbishop of China by the Holy Synod of ROCOR in 1946. When the Communists took power in China, the Russian colony was forced to flee, first to a refugee camp on the island of Tubabao in the Philippines and then mainly to the United States and Australia. Archbishop St. John personally traveled to Washington, D.C. to ensure that his people would be allowed to enter the country. =Western Europe= In 1951, St. John was assigned to the archdiocese of Western Europe with his see first in Paris, then in Brussels. Thanks to his work in collecting lives of saints, a great many pre-Schism Western saints became known in Orthodoxy and continue to be venerated to this day. His charitable and pastoral work continued as it had in Shanghai, even among a much more widely scattered flock. =San Francisco= In 1962 St. John was once again reassigned by the Holy Synod to the see of San Francisco. Here too, he found a divided community and a cathedral in an unfinished state. Although he completed the building of the Holy Virgin Cathedral and brought some measure of peace to the community he became the target of slander from those who became his political enemies, who went so far as to file a lawsuit against him for alleged mishandling of finances related to construction of the cathedral. He was exonerated, but this was a great cause of sorrow to him in his later life. Deeply revering St. John of Kronstadt, St. John Maximovitch played an active role in preparation of his canonization.Blessed John the Wonderworker: A Preliminary Account of the Life and Miracles of Archbishop John Maximovitch. Platina: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 1987.() The Relics of St. John Death and veneration On July 2, 1966 (June 19 on the Julian calendar), St. John died while visiting Seattle at a time and place he was said to have foretold. He was entombed in a sepulchre beneath the altar of the Holy Virgin Cathedral he had built in San Francisco dedicated to the Theotokos, Joy of All Who Sorrow, on Geary Boulevard in the Richmond district. In 1994 he was solemnly glorified on the 28th anniversary of his death. His unembalmed, incorrupt relics now occupy a shrine in the cathedral's nave. His feast day is celebrated on the Saturday nearest to July 2. He is beloved and celebrated worldwide, with portions of his relics located in Serbia, Russia, Mount Athos, Greece (Church of Saint Anna in Katerini), South Korea, Bulgaria, Romania, United States (St. John Maximovitch Church, Eugene, Oregon), Canada (Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church, Kitchener), England (Dormition Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church, London) and other countries of the world.

It encompasses the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, an international non- profit organization founded in 1971 by philanthropist Daniel K. Ludwig. The Institute is headquartered in New York City with a European office located in Zurich. In addition, six Ludwig Centers were established at leading US cancer research institutions. Together, the Institute and Centers are known as Ludwig Cancer Research. Since its founding in 1971, Ludwig Cancer Research has committed more than (US) $2.5 billion to cancer research. Ludwig Cancer Research focuses on both basic research and translational research, with specific emphasis on cell biology, genomics, immunology, neuroscience, prevention, cell signaling, stem cells, therapeutics, and tumor biology, as well as clinical trials and the design and development of small molecules with drug-like properties. Its researchers also focus on particular types of malignancy, including brain cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. Founder and history Daniel K. Ludwig was a shipping magnate and real estate investor. Born in South Haven, Michigan in 1897, he parleyed a $5,000 loan from his father into a global business empire based on a fleet of supertankers. In the 1960s and 1970s, Ludwig was among the richest men in the world, with a self-made empire of some 200 companies globally. He founded the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research as an independent organization in 1971, the same year that the ‚ÄúWar on Cancer,‚Äù declared by his friend President Richard Nixon, led to the establishment of the US National Cancer Institute. Ludwig believed that tackling the problem of cancer required the best minds operating in the most favorable conditions with the best resources to accomplish the task. This principle continues to guide Ludwig Cancer Research. Daniel K. Ludwig endowed the Institute with all of the foreign assets from his business holdings. Upon his death in 1992, that endowment had grown to more than $700 million, and it stands at more than $1.3 billion today. After Ludwig‚Äôs death, his US-based assets were also put into a trust to support additional cancer research efforts. These funds led to the establishment of Ludwig Centers at six research institutions in 2006. The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Ludwig Centers have been known collectively as Ludwig Cancer Research since 2012. In total, Ludwig Cancer Research has committed more than (US) $2.5 billion to cancer research worldwide since 1971. Mission and goals The primary objectives of Ludwig Cancer Research are to prevent and control cancer through basic and translational research. Research =Immunotherapy= Lloyd Old, the organization‚Äôs former director and scientific chairman, participated in the discovery of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and the tumor suppressor p53. He contributed to the immunosurveillance hypothesis, from which modern cancer immunotherapy can be derived. Thierry Boon, former director of the organization‚Äôs Brussels branch, made foundational contributions to the field of cancer immunotherapy. The prevailing model of carcinogenesis in the late 1970s held that spontaneously arising tumors were unlikely to elicit immune responses. Boon and his team, who believed otherwise, were the first to isolate genes that code for a family of tumor antigens and show that T cells could recognize and target cancer cells bearing such antigens. This theory is being tested in a number of current clinical trials. Ludwig researchers in Melbourne discovered and cloned the granulocyte- monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) through a collaboration with Australian immunologist Donald Metcalf. The factor is essential to the maturation of key white blood cells, and has been used extensively over the past few decades to help rebuild the immune system of patients undergoing chemotherapy. It is also being tested as a therapeutic agent in combination with several experimental immunotherapies for cancer. The Oncology Drug Advisory Committee of the US FDA recently recommended approval for T-VEC, a viral therapy for melanoma manufactured by Amgen that incorporates the gene for GM-CSF to support anti-cancer immune responses. Ludwig researchers in Sao Paulo played a role in establishing that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical cancer. They ran the largest epidemiological studies of HPV infection and reported that chronic, though not transient, infection by the virus dramatically increases the risk of cervical cancer, laying the groundwork for the clinical development of an HPV vaccine. Current and former Ludwig researchers contributed to an emerging class of cancer immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors. They explored the underlying immunology of the response and played a role in evaluating the first such drug in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This led the development of new criteria for evaluating responses of cancer patients to immunotherapy in clinical trials. =Cell signaling= Contributions to the field of cell signaling include the identification of signaling pathways and subsequent development of therapies. An example is the PI3K family of proteins, which play a key role in cell signaling that fuels cancer. This research led to the first Ludwig spin-off, a biotech named Piramed Ltd., which sought to develop cancer therapies based on this discovery. The company was purchased by the pharmaceutical company Roche. Drugs based on these discoveries are today being tested to treat several types of cancer, including breast and lung cancer. =Genomics= Contributions in the field of genomics include the work of Ludwig researchers at Johns Hopkins to sequence the full complement of genes expressed in many cancers, including head and neck, colon, and breast cancers, as well as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Ludwig researchers in San Diego significantly advanced studies of the epigenome, leading such efforts as the NIH‚Äôs Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Leadership The Ludwig Cancer Research board of directors helps oversee both the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and the Ludwig Fund. Although each of these entities has its own board, the boards comprise the same individuals. The current chairman of the board is John L. Notter, an international financier and developer affiliated with a variety of companies, including Westlake Properties, Inc. The executive staff manages the organization's worldwide efforts. Edward A. McDermott, Jr has been with the organization since 1988 and its CEO since 2010. It was announced in December 2016 that Chi Van Dang will take over the role of Scientific Director in July 2017. He will be responsible for coordinating the organization‚Äôs global research efforts and activities.

It centered on a scrappy group of school-aged kids in an unidentified, middle-class neighborhood. Parents and teachers were occasionally referred to, but no adult was ever pictured. Tiger was told from a child's perspective and retained its innocent kids' eye world view from beginning to end. *Tiger: The unofficial gang leader was a typical, everyman kid, clad in a loose-fitting white sweatshirt with an ever-changing caption on the front and an oversized baseball cap which covered his eyes. *Punkinhead: Tiger's precocious kid brother, na√Øve but occasionally insightful, who wore a red hooded sweater, sneakers with perpetually untied laces, an incongruously long, polka-dotted necktie and an ever-present cowlick. *Hugo: Pudgy and none- too-bright, Tiger's best friend Hugo sported a red crewcut, a single baby tooth and an unquenchable appetite. *Bonnie: A pushy, wisecracking neighborhood girl with black bobbed bangs and a loud, sarcastic demeanor. *Suzy: The frequent target of Bonnie's barbs (along with Hugo), the soft- spoken Suzy wore long blonde tresses, black leotards and white Mary Jane shoes. *Julian: The smart, bespectacled neighborhood bookworm. *Stripe: Tiger's agreeable, faithful, lazy and ever-present spotted mutt.

It incorporates anime-style characters into a medieval fantasy world. Gekkeiju Online was a GameOgre.com online game of the week, highlighting the MUD-style gameplay which is considered more in-depth than regular MMORPGs. A completely redone version of Gekkeiju Online launched to public beta test in January 2010.  Races  The game's character options consist of nine playable character races, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The playable races are: humans, elves, halflings, half-giants, dwarves, wild elves, dark elves, goblins and catfolk. It's possible to change the race during playing through reincarnation offered by various NPCs in game. This is also the only way to get access to some of the races.  Character Class system  There are 5 character classes available in Gekkeiju Online - warrior, commoner, magic user, divine arts and dark arts. Each of the character classes has its own set of guilds that can be joined to learn skills and spells. The character class also decides the skills and spells character learns automatically during the first 10 levels. Warrior is the very basic fighter class. Their guilds specialize in melee, ranged attacks and animal taming. New players always start as warriors. Commoners are a combinations of spell casters and fighters. Their guilds include for example bards and merchants. Magic Users are the strongest users of magic. They can learn spells from defensive to offensive. Divine Arts are a spellcaster class that uses divine spiritual magic such as healing-spells. Divine arts can also learn some combat skills. Dark Arts are the evil counterpart of divine arts. Dark Arts spells are focused on damage used to supplement melee combat skill. Their guilds include death knights and fallen priests.  Advancement  Advancement of character in Gekkeiju Online happens by gaining experience points by either solving quests or by killing monsters. The advancement, however, doesn't happen automatically but player needs to purchase character levels with the gained experience points which can be done at level trainer NPCs. Character will automatically learn skills during the first 10 levels every time after level advancement. However, starting at level 10 the only way to learn skills and spells is to join a guild. It's then possible to train skills in the guild with experience points. This means that starting at level 10 player needs to choose between level and skill advancement.  PvP System  Player versus player (PvP) killing in Gekkeiju Online is nearly free and without other than game enforced limitations. The limitations help those who do not like player killing. The maps in the game are divided into different PvP types:-- Guarded and PvP. Guarded maps allow players to fight each other but attacking will flag the attacking player as criminal. Guarded areas also always have guard NPCs that hunt down all criminal players. Criminal players will drop their whole inventory on ground and be teleported into jail when killed. The jail time depends on the number of players killed in a guarded map. In PvP maps fighting is allowed but slightly limited. If the attacked player doesn't retaliate before being killed by a player, the attacker will be flagged as murderer. The only way to remove the murderer flag is to gain experience points by killing monsters. Murderers also have a small chance of dropping some of their items when killed.

Founded in 1984 in Vinkovci, Majke were one of the many bands to appear in a town that had a particularly vibrant rock and alternative scene. The band started playing under the influence of bands like: MC5, Flamin' Groovies, Steppenwolf, The Stooges, New York Dolls, Motorhead and many others.  History  =1984-1989: Formation, early recordings and death of Marin Pokrovac= Majke were formed in 1984 in Vinkovci, Croatia by vocalist Goran Bare, bassist Nedjeljko Ivkoviƒá - Kilmister, drummer ≈Ωeljko Mikuliƒá - Korozija, and guitarists Marin Pokrovac and Ivica Duspara. They released their first demo tape in 1988 on the label Slu≈°aj Najglasnije. The following year, some of their early recordings appeared on the legendary Slu≈°aj Najglasnije compilation album \\"Bombardiranje New Yorka\\", which mainly consisted of recordings of rock bands from Vinkovci. The band briefly broke up after Pokrovac moved to London. However, he soon returned to Vinkovci, and the band reformed. The reunion was tragically cut short after Pokrovac's death in 1989 when he crashed his car into the Bosut river while returning from rehearsal. Two friends of the band, Pavo Pap and Goran Mato≈°eviƒá - Bratanac, died in the crash as well. =1990-1991: Razum I Bezumlje and first major breakup= The band decided to continue without Pokrovac. They recruited new guitarist Ivan Dujmiƒá, and in 1990, they released their first studio album, \\"Razum I Bezumlje\\", on the independent label Search & Enjoy. The album displayed a raw and aggressive punk-influenced garage rock style, and featured several live staples such as \\"Iz Sve Snage\\", \\"Zbunjen I O≈°amuƒáen\\", \\"Lutak Iskrivljenog Lica\\", \\"Nikada Te Neƒáu Zaboraviti\\" and \\"Putujem\\". Bare wrote the lyrics, while Duspara wrote all of the music on the album. The album was proclaimed rock album of the year by domestic audiences. However, the band's success was suddenly interrupted by the start of the Croatian War of Independence, with Vinkovci being one of the frontlines. The band soon broke up. =1992-1993: Reformation and Razdor= Bare relocated to Zagreb, and in 1992, assembled a new Majke lineup consisting of original drummer Korozija, guitarist and primary songwriter Zoran ƒåaliƒá, and bassist Jurica Ni≈æiƒá. The band recorded their second studio album \\"Razdor\\", in 1993, which was released on T.R.I.P., a sub-label of Croatia Records. The album contained famous songs such as \\"Budi Ponosan\\", \\"Krvarim Od Dosade\\", \\"Mr≈°avi Pas\\", \\"'89\\" and \\"Fantastiƒçna Vatra\\". Around this time, second guitarist Davor Viduka joined the band, though he did not play on Razdor. However, he and Ni≈æiƒá both left the band due to personal disagreements with Bare. They went on to form the successful rock band Kojoti. =1993-1994: Lineup changes and Milost= In late 1993, original bassist Kilmister returned to the band, and second guitarist Goran Dujmiƒá joined. The band released their third studio album \\"Milost\\" the following year, on the label Heroina Nova. Despite Bare considering it to be one of Majke's weaker albums, the song \\"Ja Sam Buduƒánost\\" became a hit, and a music video was filmed for it. Deceased guitarist Marin Pokrovac received a posthumous writing credit for the song \\"Postoji Ne≈°to\\", while original guitarist Ivica Duspara received a writing credit for \\"Zauvijek\\". Dujmiƒá also received writing credits for \\"Znam Ono ≈†to Treba Da Znam\\" and \\"Oslobodi Se\\". That same year, after the birth of his son, Bare checked into rehab for heroin addiction and was clean by the summer of 1995. =1995‚Äì1997: Temporary breakup, new members, Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene and ≈Ωivot U≈æivo= In 1995, the band briefly broke up, though Bare spent several months performing under the name Majke, with members of Kojoti as his backing band. Around this time, Bare's wife died after overdosing on heroin. Bare fell into a deep depression and started using heroin again as well as drinking heavily to cope with his wife's death. Late that year, the band reformed with a new lineup: Bare on vocals, Kilmister on bass, ƒåaliƒá and Kruno Domaƒáinoviƒá on guitars, and Tihomir Jal≈°ovec - Chaka on drums. The band released \\"Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene\\", their fourth and most commercially successful studio album, on Jabukaton records in 1996. Originally intended to be an EP, this album displayed a softer blues rock sound compared to their old, more aggressive garage rock style. The album had a much more sorrowful feel to it as the band was going through difficult times while recording the album, with Bare dealing with his wife's death, depression and addiction, as well as Kilmister's father dying in the middle of recording. The band utilized session musicians Davor Rodik and Gojko Tomljanoviƒá to play pedal steel guitar and keyboards, respectively. The album contained several hits, the most famous being \\"Mene Ne Zanima\\", \\"Odvedi Me\\" and \\"A Ti Jo≈° Plaƒçe≈°\\". A music video was filmed for Mene Ne Zanima, which won a Porin award. The title track and \\"Baretov Blues\\" became live staples as well, while original guitarist Ivica Duspara received a writing credit for \\"Nije Lako\\". The next year, the band released their first live album \\"≈Ωivot U≈æivo\\", recorded at the concert venue Dom Sportova on April 25th, 1997. The following year, the band won two Crni Maƒçak awards for best rock artist and best live performance. =1998-2000: Put Do Srca Sunca, lineup changes and second major breakup= In 1998, the band filmed a music video for a new song called \\"Daj Mi\\", announcing a new studio album. The band's fifth studio album, \\"Put Do Srca Sunca\\", was released later that year. This album was more complex and experimental, with some songs featuring a pedal steel guitar, a Hammond organ, congas, and even a horn section. The album contained the hit single \\"Gre≈°nik\\", for which a music video was filmed. A few months after the album's release, Chaka left the band and was replaced by Thomas Bala≈æ, who previously played in the bands Anesthesia, Divlje Jagode and Te≈°ko Vrijeme, an early incarnation of Hard Time. The live album ≈Ωivot U≈æivo won a Porin award for best alternative rock album. Shortly after the Porin awards, guitarist Zoran ƒåaliƒá left the band, later citing Bare's alcohol and drug abuse as one of the main reasons for his departure. The next year, Put Do Srca Sunca won a Crni Maƒçak award for the best cover art. Near the end of 1999, the band recorded a new version of the song \\"Budi Ponosan\\" from their second studio album, \\"Razdor\\", to mark the band's 15th anniversary. Around this time, Bare checked into rehab for heroin addiction again, and was clean by the following year. In the spring of 2000, the band announced that they were breaking up once again. However, they still played several shows throughout the summer due to contractual obligations, and they played their final show at Bike October Fest on September 30th, 2000. After the breakup, Bare embarked on a successful solo career, releasing his first album, \\"Izgubljen I Naƒëen\\", in 2001, recorded with his backing band Plaƒáenici. Meanwhile, ƒåaliƒá and Kilmister formed the band Elektrobuda, releasing an album titled \\"Sveti Zvuk\\" in 2005. =2007-2008: Reunion and Majke Unplugged= In 2007, after seven years of inactivity, most of the \\"Vrijeme je da se krene\\" lineup reunited under the moniker Goran Bare & Majke, with ex-Laufer drummer Alen Tiblja≈° replacing Chaka. Tiblja≈° had also previously played with Bare in his backing band, Plaƒáenici. The band also recruited Cota G4 keyboardist Danko Krznariƒá. They played their first show since 2000 at the famous venue Tvornica Kulture in Zagreb on March 8th, which was recorded for a live album that would not be released until 2013. Krznariƒá soon left the band and was replaced by Parni Valjak keyboardist Berislav Bla≈æeviƒá, who previously worked with Bare during his solo career, and also played keyboards on the band's 1999 re-recording of Budi Ponosan. On April 12th 2008, the band played a well received acoustic show at Tvornica Kulture, which was recorded and released as the live album \\"Majke Unplugged\\". The band continued performing live around the country, and began talks of recording a new studio album. =2009-2013: Lineup changes, Te≈°ke Boje and departure of Zoran ƒåaliƒá= By the end of 2009, Kilmister, Domaƒáinoviƒá, Tiblja≈° and Bla≈æeviƒá left the band due to personal differences with Bare. This left Bare as the only remaining original member of Majke. He and ƒåaliƒá assembled a new lineup consisting of bassist Mario Ra≈°iƒá, who previously played with Bare in his backing band Plaƒáenici; Gatuzo guitarist Damir Trkulja - ≈†iljo, drummer Damir ≈†omen and keyboardist Viktor Lipiƒá. This lineup recorded the band's sixth studio album, \\"Te≈°ke Boje\\", which was released in 2011. On this album, the band displayed a much darker and more aggressive style of blues rock, with psychedelic elements mixed in as well. The title track was a hit, with some critics even calling it the \\"best Croatian rock song of the last 20 years\\", and a music video was filmed for it. Other staples from the album included \\"Pozovi Me U Noƒá\\" and \\"Depresija\\". In 2012, the album won several Porin awards for song of the year, best rock album, and best music video of the year. Soon afterwards, ≈†iljo left the band due to personal issues with Bare and was replaced by ex-Pips, Chips i Videoclips guitarist Alen Kraljiƒá, who also played with Bare as a member of Plaƒáenici. In 2013, the band released the live album \\"Majke U Tvornici\\", which was recorded six years ago at the Tvornica Kulture. By the end of the year, Zoran ƒåaliƒá left the band once again. He went on to form a new band called Zoran ƒåaliƒá Bend. Meanwhile, Bare would keep Majke going, and the band would spend the next few years going through various personnel changes until finally assembling a stable lineup once again. At one point, the band featured two members of Kojoti; bassist Vanja Marin and keyboardist Dan Divjak, who passed away in 2017. =2014-present: Lineup changes and Nuspojave= On December 28th, 2016, the \\"Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene\\" lineup briefly reunited at the cult Zagreb alternative nightclub Jabuka to promote the remastered version of Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene. It was the first time Bare and Kilmister spoke since 2009, as well as former drummer Chaka's first public appearance since his departure from the band in 1998. By 2018, after years of lineup changes and rarely playing live, Bare finally assembled a stable lineup of the band once again. Guitarist Kruno Domaƒáinoviƒá returned to the band, along with drummer Alen Tiblja≈° and keyboardist Berislav Bla≈æeviƒá. Bassist Mario Ra≈°iƒá returned as well, and longtime collaborator and pedal steel guitarist Davor Rodik joined the band as a permanent second guitarist. In 2018, the new Majke lineup released their long awaited seventh studio album, \\"Nuspojave\\". This album featured a softer, more experimental and complex style compared to their previous work, with Bare comparing it to Lou Reed's work. The album contained the singles \\"Osvijesti Me\\", \\"Ljubav Krvari\\", \\"To Nije Igra\\" and \\"Za≈°to\\", and a music video was filmed for Osvijesti Me. The band played a well-received show at the Tvornica Kulture on November 9th, 2018. A music video for To Nije Igra was filmed during the show. In 2019, the band performed a show backed by an orchestra at the ≈†alata stadium in Zagreb on June 1st, the Ferragosto Jam festival on August 2nd, and another show at Tvornica Kulture on November 24th.

When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive.Pulmonary Hemorrhage Intensive Care Nursery House Staff Manual. UCSF Children's Hospital at UCSF Medical Center. 2004:The Regents of the University of California. Retrieved 2008-10-28. The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to cyanosis. Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities (e.g. disorders of coagulation). A blood transfusion may be necessary. Causes Infant prematurity is the factor most commonly associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. Other associated factors are those that predisposed to perinatal asphyxia or bleeding disorders, including toxemia of pregnancy, maternal cocaine use, erythroblastosis fetalis, breech delivery, hypothermia, infection, Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), administration of exogenous surfactants (in some studies) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Pathophysiology Although the pathogenesis is uncertain, it is probable that the symptoms are a consequence of hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, as the hematocrit is lower than normal blood (usually 15-20% less) and the concentration of small proteins is higher than in plasma. It is postulated that the infant suffers from asphyxia with resultant heart attack; this increases pulmonary microvascular pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema. Contributing factors include factors that favor increased filtration of fluid from pulmonary capillaries (e.g., low concentration of plasma proteins, high alveolar surface tension, lung damage, hypervolemia). = Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage = Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is bleeding from many alveoli throughout the lungs. Common causes include autoimmune diseases and connective tissue diseases. Incidence The outcome of treatment is dependent on causality. Pulmonary Hemorrhage is present in 7 to 10% of neonatal autopsies, but up to 80% of autopsies of very preterm infants. The incidence is 1 in 1,000 live births. Pulmonary hemorrhage has a high mortality rate of 30% to 40%.

Connery, released in America as Operation Kid Brother, is a 1967 Italian Eurospy comedy film shot in Technicolor and Techniscope and directed by Alberto De Martino. The Spy-Fi plot involves the brother of the British spy James Bond, played by Neil Connery (the actual brother of Sean Connery, star of the Eon Productions Bond films) who is obliged to take the lead in foiling a world-domination plot. The film's cast included several actors from the Eon- produced James Bond film series, Thunderballs Adolfo Celi, From Russia with Loves Daniela Bianchi, Dr. Nos Anthony Dawson, Bernard Lee (M), and Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny), as well as the producer's wife Agata Flori, Gina Lollobrigida's cousin Guido Lollobrigida, and Yasuko Yama (aka Yee-Wah Youngp. 13 Anderson Daily Bulletin from Anderson, Indiana January 11, 1967 and Yee-Wah Yang) then in the publicity spotlight due to her relationship with James Mason.p. 31 Sweeney, Kevin James Mason: A Bio-Bibliography Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999p. 146 Morley, Sheridan James Mason: Odd Man Out Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1 Apr 1989 She appeared as a bath girl in You Only Live Twice under the name Yee-Wah Yang.p. 8 \\"Oh No, Say Mason and the Bond Girl Yama The Straits Times, 18 December 1966 The film received generally negative reviews from the New York Times, Variety and the Monthly Film Bulletin with the latter two reviews noting that the film could leave audiences with unintentional laughter at its ineptitude. The film was featured on the film- mocking television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993.  Plot  When a legendary British Intelligence (SIS) agent is murdered, fellow agent Miss Maxwell (Lois Maxwell) is sent to find the late spy's girlfriend, Miss Yashuko (Yashuko Yama), who is unwittingly in possession of valuable information. Maxwell discovers that Yashuko is in the care of Dr. Neil Connery, a cosmetic surgeon who uses hypnotism in his practice. Yashuko is kidnapped from a medical conference in Monte Carlo by Maya Rafis (Daniela Bianchi), as part of a plot by Mr. Thayer (Adolfo Celi), code name Beta, of the terrorist organization THANATOS. The Secret Service's Commander Cunningham (Bernard Lee) assigns -- or rather, extorts -- Connery to join the mission to find Miss Yashuko. Connery hypnotizes a beautiful girl named Mildred (Agata Flori) to acquire information and discovers that Miss Yashuko is located in a Spanish castle belonging to Lotte Krayendorf (Anne-Marie No√©). Connery rescues Miss Yashuko and obtains critical intelligence. This information leads to the discovery of THANATOS's plan to build a super magnet, powerful enough to turn off all mechanical products from New York to Moscow. The weapon is being assembled in a Moroccan rug factory, where all the employees are blind. Miss Yashuko is murdered by Mildred before revealing any further information. Mildred is then killed by Juan (Franco Giacobini), Connery's aide. After arriving in Morocco, Connery is invited by Maya Rafis to a party held by Thayer. During the reception, Connery discovers that Thayer is planning to assassinate the head of THANATOS, known as Alpha (Anthony Dawson), and he wants Connery to surgically alter an underling to become Alpha's double; however, Connery instead hypnotizes the underling into attacking Thayer, allowing Connery to escape. He warns Maya about his discovery as she leads him to the rug factory. Upon entering the factory, Connery realizes that it is actually producing strands of uranium, and the employees' blindness prevents them from discovering their dangerous role. Together, Connery and Maya track the final uranium shipment to Switzerland, where Thayer, having abandoned his plan to replace Alpha, has completed development of the powerful magnet and soon activates it. Together, with the help of a team of Scottish archers (as firearms are rendered inoperative by the magnet), Connery and Maya kill Thayer and most of his underlings before destroying THANATOS's Swiss base. After the completion of the mission, Commander Cunningham attempts to finagle Connery into continuing to work for him, but Connery hypnotizes Cunningham into departing for London immediately and leaving Connery in peace, allowing him, Maya, and an all-female yacht crew (formerly employed by Thayer) to enjoy a relaxing cruise.

It was the second B&M; Hyper Coaster model to open in the United States, closely following the opening of Apollo's Chariot at Busch Gardens Williamsburg. History On October 21, 1998, Six Flags Great America announced that they would be adding Raging Bull for the 1999 season. It would be located in the Southwest Territory section next to Viper. The park hired Bolliger & Mabillard to build a brand new hyper coaster. Construction on Raging Bull began in November 1998 and was completed by the following spring. It opened to the public on May 1, 1999. On June 15, 2016, Six Flags announced that Virtual Reality (VR) would be added to the ride later in the year. The VR experience didn't last long on the rides that offered it across the Six Flags chain, however, due to slower load times and longer lines, as well as additional staffing to distribute and sanitize each headset. Description Raging Bull is located in the Southwest Territory section of Six Flags Great America, situated between Viper and the giant helix on American Eagle. It was built on the site previously occupied by Rolling Thunder, a bobsled roller coaster moved from Six Flags Great Adventure in 1990 and later relocated to The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom in 1996. Raging Bull's station is designed to have a run-down appearance. The track is painted orange with unpainted rails and wine-colored supports. Ride experience As the train exits the station, it makes a left turn and a small dip before ascending the lift hill. At the , the train traverses a pre-drop into a brief straight section of track, before making a into a tunnel, reaching speeds of up to . The track then ascends into a hammerhead turn to the right. After the turnaround is a parabolic hill with a trim brake on the uphill side. This is followed by another hill that banks left over the station area, a dip under the lift hill, and another hammerhead turn to the left. The train then makes a right-hand uphill turn into a mid- course brake run. Dropping off the mid-course brakes, the track passes the on- ride camera. This is followed by an airtime hill and a three-quarter turn to the right, wrapping around the first drop and diving into a figure-eight turn. Exiting the turn, the train rises uphill and enters the final brake run before returning to the station.

They released their final album Chicken Scratch in 2002, which received the 2003 Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year for a Group. The duo ceased to function as Dawson preferred to focus on his production work and reduce his travel commitments and Zubot wanted to stretch out musically into other genres as well as concentrate on album production and film scoring.  Members  Zubot plays fiddle and mandolin as well as electric mandolin while Dawson plays acoustic, tremolo acoustic, National tricone and Weissenborn Hawaiian guitar. While the group started as a duo, other players were added over the years. Andrew Downing joined Zubot and Dawson as a double bass player. Elliot Polsky joined the group as percussion player.

The novel is a downtown satire on Kay Thompson's Eloise series (1956‚Äì59). First published in hardcover by Doubleday & Company, Suzuki Beane reappeared as a McFadden Books paperback that same year. The story, sometimes described as \\"the Eloise of Greenwich Village\\", is told from the viewpoint of a young child of Bleecker Street beats. Little Suzuki encounters a different lifestyle when she becomes friends with Henry Martin, a rich kid from the Upper East Side. The two learn about life, love and how to deal with prejudice in the early 1960s. The pair finally decide to \\"run away from home and start a village where a Square can be a square and a swinging cat can swing in peace\\". Desilu purchased the rights in 1962 for a possible adaptation of the characters for development and inclusion into a live-action television series starring comedian-musician Victor Borge. A television pilot was made, with Katie Sweet as Suzuki and Jimmy Garrett as Henry, but the series was not picked up. The Suzuki Beane book continued to sell. Original copies of the books are now considered collectibles and are frequently traded for high prices on the Internet and at antique book stores. David Teague purchased the rights to Suzuki Beane from Scoppettone and has written and illustrated sequels to the original book.

As the Yellowstone river flows north from Yellowstone Lake, it leaves the Hayden Valley and plunges first over Upper Yellowstone Falls and then a quarter mile (400 m) downstream over Lower Yellowstone Falls, at which point it then enters the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which is up to 1,000 feet (304 m) deep. Upper Yellowstone Falls The upper falls () are 109 feet (33 m) high. The brink of the upper falls marks the junction between a hard rhyolite lava flow and weaker glassy lava that has been more heavily eroded. Lower Yellowstone Falls Cascading from the 590,000 year old Canyon Rhyolite lava flow, Lower Yellowstone Falls is the largest volume waterfall in the Rocky Mountains of the United States. These falls () are high, or nearly twice as high as Niagara Falls. The volume of water flowing over Lower Yellowstone Falls can vary from in the autumn, to at peak runoff in late springtime. The flow rate of Lower Yellowstone Falls is much less than that of Niagara Falls, as the Yellowstone River is only at the point at which it goes over the lower falls, whereas the Niagara River is in width as it approaches the crest line of Horseshoe Falls. History It is likely that Native American tribes knew of the falls for centuries. Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition made a note in his journal about hearing of the falls but did not believe the story. The first European to see the falls was likely French fur trapper Baptise Ducharme who claimed to see the falls in 1824, 1826 and 1839. Jim Bridger and fellow explorer James Gremmell claimed they visited the falls in 1846. In 1851, Bridger provided missionary Father Pierre-Jean De Smet a map showing the location of the falls. The Cook‚ÄìFolsom‚ÄìPeterson Expedition, a private group of three explorers named the falls in 1869. The earliest images of the falls were drawn by Private Charles Moore, a member of the U.S. Army escort of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition which explored the Yellowstone River in August‚ÄìSeptember 1870. During the Hayden Expedition of 1871, the falls were documented in photographs by William Henry Jackson and later in paintings by Thomas Moran. In January 1887, Frank Jay Haynes took the first winter photographs of the lower falls. Over the years the estimates of the height of Lower Falls has varied dramatically. In 1851 Jim Bridger estimated its height at 250 feet. One outrageous newspaper story from 1867 placed its height at \\"thousands of feet\\". A map from 1869 gives the falls its current name of Lower Falls for the first time and estimates the height at 350 feet. However the current map lists the Lower Falls at a height of 308 feet. Viewing the falls Today, there are numerous vantage points for viewing the falls. The Canyon loop road skirts the west side of the canyon with several vehicle parking areas. One trail leads down to the brink of the lower falls, a steep third of a mile (600 m). Uncle Tom's Trail descends from the east down a series of stairs attached to the cliffs. The Lower Falls area is located just to the south and east of Canyon Village in Yellowstone National Park. A one- way loop drive starting south from Canyon Junction takes one to the brink of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and offers four viewpoints, with the first stop at the trail that leads to the top of the Lower Falls. The one-way drive continues east and north past the other viewpoints, rejoining the main Grand Loop road from the east at Canyon Junction once more.

Antarctica New Zealand is an Institute set up by the Government of New Zealand in 1996 to manage its interests in Antarctica and the Ross Sea. As well as providing logistics support to a large scientific programme, it also runs bases such as Scott Base. It has run other bases in the past, such as Vanda Station. New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica began in 1923, when activities were closely connected with the United Kingdom. Close cooperation with other nations has been an important part of New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica. Since 1959 Scott Base has been New Zealand's permanent base in Antarctica. From 1965 to 1988 the person responsible for much of Scott Base development as head of the Antarctic Division of the DSIR was Bob Thomson A 1994 review recognised Antarctica as strategically important to New Zealand as a Southern Hemisphere nation. This resulted in the establishment of the New Zealand Antarctic Institute, known as Antarctica New Zealand, on 1 July 1996. The Institute reports to the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Antarctic Policy Unit. It is a Crown entity, and has a CEO and a Board. Members of the Board are appointed for three years by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade in consultation with the Board Chair. This period may be extended by the Minister for up to a further three years. Members are collectively accountable to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the performance of Antarctica New Zealand. All delegated functions and powers within Antarctica New Zealand arise from the Board's delegations. The Board‚Äôs role is governance. Specific functions within this overall role include setting the strategic direction of Antarctica New Zealand and developing policy in a manner consistent with the organisation‚Äôs statutory framework, for example through the Annual Business Plan, ensuring compliance with the law, accountability documents and relevant Crown expectations. This includes financial responsibility for all money received by the Crown and reinforcing expectations of behaviour that are appropriate to a public body, appointing the Chief Executive, monitoring the performance of Antarctica New Zealand and the Chief Executive, and maintaining appropriate relationships with the Minister, Parliament and the public. This includes accounting for the performance and management of the organisation. The Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and management of Antarctica New Zealand. In August 2018 Peter Beggs the chief executive from 2014 was asked to resign immediately by the board. An NZ$ 150 million upgrade for Scott Base is currently being planned. In June 2019 the Government committed NZ$ 18.5 million (US$ 12.4 million) for the next phase of the Scott Base Redevelopment project. Jasmax and Hugh Broughton Architects came up with the architectural design. Antarctica New Zealand is located at the International Antarctic Centre in Christchurch.

He is the eldest of the five Machado Brothers, known for BJJ, that also includes Roger, Rigan, Jean Jacques and John. He is also the brother-in-law of UFC fighter Stephen Thompson. He currently runs BJJ schools across the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Early life  Carlos started martial arts at the age of four. His main instructor throughout his life was his cousin Carlos Gracie, Jr. but he has also trained with Helio Gracie, Carlson Gracie, Rolls Gracie, Rickson Gracie, Crolin Gracie, Rillion Gracie and his brothers. While in Brazil, he has successfully competed and was champion for 10 years straight in competition at the State and National level which at the time was equivalent to the Worlds as BJJ had not spread to the masses yet. He competed and won against many of today's top founders of BJJ teams! He believes BJJ is the greatest addition to modern martial arts. Carlos also lived with his Uncle Carlos Gracie, founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Carlos greatest mentor, for 5 years while attending and eventually graduating from Law School. Moving to the USA Carlos was teaching in America as early as 1990. In April 1994 he moved to Los Angeles, California. There he met martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who was instrumental in promoting Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and the Machado family. Since then, Mr. Norris has been one of the greatest advocates of Machado Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Carlos lived in Los Angeles until the end of 1995, when he moved to the city of Dallas, Texas. There he taught Brazilian jiu-jitsu out of the same building in which Chuck Norris's television show \\"Walker, Texas Ranger\\" was filmed. That allowed Machado not only to teach at his studio, but also to take part in many episodes of that popular show. He often assisted on choreographing fight scenes with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Besides running his school, Machado has been involved in competition, winning the Pan American of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (97/98), he also won several super fights in the U.S. (U.S Open 98/99), he competed in ADCC with a broken foot and still placed and earned the award of fastest submission in 1998, and the World Master's Championships (2000) in two weight divisions (middle weight and open class). After an impressive 34 year stellar competition career he retired from the competition arena winning the Worlds! He currently holds the highest rank of this style in the Southwest (Eighth Degree Black Belt). Carlos Machado is considered the \\"god father\\" of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Texas. Carlos has built one of the fastest growing affiliate school programs in the World, which now includes representatives in Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Missouri, Philadelphia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, England, France, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.

Mount Lyell was the dominant copper mining company of the West Coast from 1893 to 1994, and was based in Queenstown, Tasmania. Following consolidation of leases and company assets at the beginning of the twentieth century, Mount Lyell was the major company for the communities of Queenstown, Strahan and Gormanston. It remained dominant until its closure in 1994. The Mount Lyell mining operations produced more than a million tonnes of copper, 750 tonnes of silver and 45 tonnes of gold since mining commenced in the early 1890s - which is equivalent to over 4 billion dollars worth of metal in 1995 terms.The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited (1994) A Century of Copper Queenstown, Tasmania page 2, see also later editions of The Peaks of Lyell  History  Self acting haulage of Mount Lyell 2ft tramway in Tasmania In the early stage of operations, Mount Lyell was surrounded by smaller competing leases and companies. Eventually they were all absorbed into Mount Lyell operations, or were closed down. In 1903 the North Mount Lyell company was taken over, and in 1912 the most severe calamity to visit the Mount Lyell company was the 1912 North Mount Lyell Disaster, also known at the time as the North Lyell fire. During its history, Mount Lyell had exploration leases surrounding its main mining area, and had at one time or other explored most of the West Coast Range revisiting many of the smaller mines that had been worked on in the early 1900s. As a consequence the Mount Lyell company had utilised considerable resources on maintaining leases over areas of promising geology - as well as checking older mining locations on the west coast. At various stages it also shared costs and resources with other companies which would assist by investing in exploration by becoming partners in some leases. The operations were conducted in various parts of the Mount Lyell Lease, and in the mid 1970s, prior to reduction in the workforce, \\"Cape Horn\\" was located just west of the \\"Comstock\\" operation which was on the north side of Mount Lyell, while most of the North Mount Lyell workings were finished, \\"12 West\\" was still in operation due to its rich copper ores. \\"West Lyell open cut\\" which had been dominant in the 1950s was finished, and various parts of the lease were disappearing into the opening above the \\"Prince Lyell\\" workings. Following the first large layoffs in the mid 1970s, the town of Queenstown lost its dominance on the west coast by the mid 1990s, and being mainly a company town many services closed by the 2000s, and the separate west Tasmanian local government authorities were amalgamated into the West Coast Council. = Centenary = On 29 March 1993 the company celebrated its centenary. At that stage it was known as the Copper Division of Renison Goldfields Consolidated Limited. The Mount Lyell Mining Field, and the various activities of the company in Queenstown and the west coast of Tasmania were celebrated throughout the community. = Current = Mount Lyell mine in 2014 The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was conducted between 1994 and 1996 following the closing of the company, to reverse the ecological change upon the Queen and King Rivers, and Macquarie Harbour; caused by the release of mine waste and effluent into the rivers. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River. The Mount Lyell lease and mine was reopened by Copper Mines of Tasmania in 1995. This company in turn was acquired by Sterlite Industries, an Indian-based company, in 1999. As a consequence it is part of the Vedanta group of companies. Its concentrate material is shipped to India for processing. Government guidelines saw tailings dams created and special measures taken to prevent any further pollution of the rivers and harbour. Mining was suspended at Mount Lyell due to accidents in the 2010s, and remains in mothball situation in the late 2010s.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-09/queenstown-residents-reeling- after-mount-lyell-mine-closure/5585754  Mine Operation  The following locations were within the operating mine lease and indicate a separate orebody - the operating life is also indicated:The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited (1994) A Century of Copper Queenstown, Tasmania page 6, \\\\- * Iron Blow 1883 - 1929 * North Lyell 1896 - 1972 * Royal Tharsis 1902 - 1991Tasmania.

Mount Lyell was also the operator of the gauge Queenstown to Regatta Point railway from 1893 to 1963, which used the Abt rack system of cog railway for steep sections. This railway was rebuilt and recommenced operation in 2002 as the Abt Wilderness Railway, and is now known as the West Coast Wilderness Railway and was operated by Federal Hotels until 2013.  Archives  The company has been significant in Australian business history works as Geoffrey Blainey, the Australian historian, began his career with the writing of the company history The Peaks of Lyell, which has now progressed to its sixth edition. Also, due to circumstances at the winding up of Mount Lyell significant amounts of company records were deposited with Tasmanian state archives. Environmental impact Pollution of the Queen and King Rivers, and Macquarie Harbour was caused by the release of mine waste and effluent into the rivers. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River. The environmental impacts included: * tailings, slag and acid drainage into rivers and a delta of tailings the size of a city suburb in Macquarie Harbour; * all aquatic life in the Queen River and lower King River has been killed; * waterways contaminated with toxic metals, particularly copper, representing a potential hazard to the fishing industry and other harbour uses; * vegetation on Queenstown hills destroyed by felling, fire, erosion and toxic fumes from smelting. Smelting ended in the 1960s and CMT has built a dam to contain tailings. Research by the Supervising Scientist published in 1997 overwhelmingly identified the lease site as the major source of acid drainage-related pollutants affecting the rivers and harbour, with metals contamination from tailing and slag deposits being very minor in comparison. Within the lease site, the North Lyell Tunnel has water derived in part from underground workings and has approximately 78% of the lease site copper loading. Discharge from other tunnels and waste rock dumps accounts for 21%. The remaining 1% is from smaller sources. Downstream, chemical modelling and toxicological testing indicates that 95% to 99% of the acid drainage from the site must be neutralised or stemmed for the resultant water quality to meet downstream environmental quality objectives. Contaminated sediments in the King River and Macquarie Harbour contribute relatively little of the total pollutant load entering the harbour.http://www.environment.gov.au/ssd/publications/ssr/126.html, Koehnken L (1997) Final report: Mount Lyell Remediation Research and Demonstration Program, Supervising Scientist Report 126.

Diocesan administrators in canon law The college of consultors elects an administrator within eight days after the see is known to be vacant.Code of Canon Law, canon 421 ¬ß1. The college must elect as administrator a priest or bishop at least 35 years old.Code of Canon Law, canon 425 ¬ß1. The word used in the canon (sacerdos) is not limited to a priest and applies also to a bishop. If the college of consultors fails to elect a priest of the required minimum age within the time allotted, the choice of diocesan administrator passes to the metropolitan archbishop or, if the metropolitan see is vacant, to the senior by appointment of the suffragan bishops of the ecclesiastical province.Code of Canon Law, canons 421 ¬ß2 and 425 ¬ß3. If a diocese has a coadjutor bishop, the coadjutor succeeds immediately to the episcopal see upon the previous bishop's death or resignation, and there is no vacancy of the see. The see also does not become vacant if the Pope appoints an apostolic administrator. Before the election of the diocesan administrator of a vacant see, the governance of the see is entrusted, with the powers of a vicar general, to the auxiliary bishop, if there is one, or to the senior among them, if there are several, otherwise to the college of consultors as a whole. The diocesan administrator has greater powers, essentially those of a bishop except for matters excepted by the nature of the matter or expressly by law.Code of Canon Law, canons 426-427 Canon law subjects his activity to various legal restrictions and to special supervision by the college of consultors (as for example canons 272 and 485). The diocesan administrator remains in charge until a new bishop takes possession of the see or until he presents his resignation to the college of consultors.Code of Canon Law, canons 430 Some Bishops ruled more than one bishopric for long. In any beside their primary bishopric, they would have to be called an administrator. Nevertheless, in local tradition often they are called bishops in all their bishoprics. An episcopal conference can transfer the functions of the consultors to the cathedral chapter.Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 502 ¬ß 3. In those countries in which the episcopal conference has transferred the functions, the cathedral chapter, and not the consultors, elect the diocesan administrator.See Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 421 ¬ß 1 (noting that the consultors elect the administrator, \\"without prejudice to the provisions of can. 502 ¬ß3\\"). Capitular election was the default rule before the adoption of the 1983 Code of Canon Law;Codex Iuris Canonici Canons 431‚Äì432 (1917). this old default rule is reflected in the term for the equivalent of a diocesan administrator in the 1917 code: vicar capitular. Administrators of prince-bishoprics Since the Investiture Controversy in 11th and 12th centuries the cathedral chapters used to elect the Catholic bishops in the Holy Roman Empire. Prince-bishoprics were elective monarchies of imperial immediacy within the Empire, with the monarch being the respective bishop usually elected by the chapter and confirmed by the Holy See, or exceptionally only appointed by the Holy See. Papally confirmed bishops were then invested by the emperor with the princely regalia, thus the title prince-bishop. However, sometimes the respective incumbent of the see never gained a papal confirmation, but was still invested with the princely power. Also the opposite occurred with a papally confirmed bishop, never invested as prince. Candidates elected, who lacked canon-law prerequisites and/or papal confirmation, would officially only hold the title diocesan administrator (but nevertheless colloquially be referred to as prince-bishop). This was the case with Catholic candidates, who were elected for an episcopal see with its revenues as a mere appanage and with all Protestant candidates, who all lacked either the necessary vocational training or the papal confirmation. Protestant \\"elected bishops\\" With many capitulars converting to Lutheranism or Calvinism during the Reformation, the majorities in many chapters consisted of Protestant capitulars. So they then also elected Protestants as bishops, who usually were denied papal confirmation. However, in the early years of Reformation, with the schism not yet fully implemented, it was not always obvious, who tended to Protestantism, so that some candidates only turned out to be Protestants after they had been papally confirmed as bishop and imperially invested as prince. Later, when Protestants were usually denied papal confirmation, the emperors nevertheless invested the unconfirmed candidates as princes - by a so-called liege indult () - due to political coalitions and conflicts within the empire, in order to gain candidates as imperial partisans. Many Protestant candidates, elected by the capitulars, neither achieved papal confirmation nor a liege indult, but nevertheless, as a matter of fact held de facto princely power. This was because the emperor would have to use force to bar the candidates from ruling, with the emperors lacking the respective power or pursuing other goals. A similar situation was in a number of imperially immediate abbeys with their prince-abbots and princess-abbesses. Unconfirmed incumbents of the sees were called Elected Bishops or Elected Archbishops. The information that Protestant clerical rulers would generally have been called administrators, as written in several encyclopedies, does not fit historically documented practice.Eike Wolgast: Hochstift und Reformation. Studien zur Geschichte der Reichskirche zwischen 1517 und 1648, Stuttgart 1995 In their dioceses as well as in their territories, they had almost the same power as Catholic prince-bishops. However, one common restriction was that administered prince-bishoprics were denied to emit their deputies to the diets of the Empire or of the imperial circles (, respectively). This restriction was abandoned by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, when the emperor accepted Protestant administrators as fully empowered rulers. However, the Peace also secularised many of the prior Protestant prince-bishoprics and transformed them into hereditary monarchies. =Prince-bishoprics ruled by Protestant bishops = Prince-bishoprics, which were ruled by Protestants, were the following: * Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg, Lutheran bishops and administrators since 1539, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1571. * Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, Lutheran administrators since 1567, secularised as hereditary Duchy of Bremen in 1648 * Prince-Bishopric of Cammin, Lutheran bishops and administrators since 1544, secularised and merged into the Duchy of Pomerania in 1650 * Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, Lutheran administrators 1566‚Äì1628, after the rule of the last, however, Catholic administrator, secularised as Principality of Halberstadt in 1648 * Prince-Bishopric of Havelberg, Lutheran bishops and administrators since 1558, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1598. * Prince-Bishopric of Lebus, Lutheran bishop and administrators since 1555, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1598. * Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck, Lutheran bishops and administrators in 1535 and from 1555 on, secularised as Principality of L√ºbeck in 1803 * Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg, Lutheran administrators between 1566 and 1631 and again since 1638, secularised as hereditary Duchy of Magdeburg in 1680 * Prince-Bishopric of Merseburg, Lutheran administrators since 1544, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Saxony in 1565 * Prince-Bishopric of Minden, Lutheran administrators between 1554 and 1631, after the rule of the last, however, Catholic prince- bishop, secularised as Principality of Minden in 1648 * Prince-Bishopric of Naumburg, Lutheran bishop and administrators between 1542 and 1547 and from 1562 on, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Saxony in 1615 * Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck, Lutheran bishops and administrators between 1574 and 1623, and Lutheran administrators and Catholic bishops in alternate succession since 1634, secularised and merged into the Electorate of Brunswick and Lunenburg in 1803 * Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg, Lutheran administrators since 1554, secularised as the Principality of Ratzeburg in 1648 * Prince- Bishopric of Schwerin, Lutheran administrators since 1533, secularised as the Principality of Schwerin in 1648 * Prince-Bishopric of Verden, Lutheran bishop and administrators between 1574 and 1630, and, after the rule of the last, however, Catholic prince-bishop, from 1631 on, secularised as Principality of Verden in 1648 References  External links  *Out-of-date article in the Catholic Encyclopedia, written before the Codes of Canon Law of 1917 and 1983 altered the conditions Category:Catholic ecclesiastical titles ","title":"Diocesan administrator"},{"id":"2185500","text":"Electron is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

He is also known for his wide vocal range, with his modal voice spanning over four octaves. In 2015, Harnell was briefly the frontman for heavy metal band Skid Row. Biography Harnell was born in San Diego, California in 1962. He has an older half sister by his father. His mother, Constance Haldaman, was an opera singer while his father, Boyd Harnell, was a photojournalist. As a teenager, Tony Harnell was a professional skateboarder and avid surfer. =Early years= Harnell started singing at the age of 5. At 17 he joined his first band and spent the next three years in approximately fifteen bands including Bronx-based Jackals, a band of cultivated talent emerging from the guitarist's home basement that in a scant two years, gained enough popularity in the NYC area to fill rock clubs to capacity simply by word of mouth alone. This was the band in which Harnell was discovered. At 18, Harnell started studying with vocal teacher Don Lawrence. =TNT= After a show in 1984, Harnell was introduced to record producer Mike Varney who mentioned a band in Norway, TNT, that was looking for a singer. Harnell was hired shortly after the band heard a demo tape of his vocals. Harnell and guitarist Ronni Le Tekr√∏ co-wrote all of TNT's material together during Harnell's 22-year run with the band. With Harnell, TNT recorded nine studio albums, two live videos and two \\"best of\\" compilations. He left the band in April 2006 for personal and professional reasons. He performed his last show with the band on June 30, 2006 and a DVD was released that autumn that features the penultimate show in Madrid, Spain on April 1. On October 17, 2013, Harnell announced that he had rejoined TNT. After a year and a half absence, during which time, he fronted Skid Row, Harnell announced another return to TNT in May 2016. Harnell would leave the band once again in October 2017 and was replaced by previous unknown Baol Bardot Bulsara. =Morning Wood= Morning Wood is an acoustic rock supergroup composed of Harnell, Al Pitrelli, Chuck Bonfonte, and Danny Mirada. The act's album was first released in Japan in 1994 during TNT's first break-up and in 2002 was re-released in Europe credited to \\"Tony Harnell and Morning Wood.\\" =Westworld= Westworld is a side project of Harnell's that also featured Mark Reale, Bruno Ravel, and John O'Reilly, with keyboardist Josh Pincus and violinist Mark Wood. Westworld has released three studio albums and a live album. =Starbreaker= Starbreaker is another band featuring Harnell and Magnus Karlsson. Some former members include John Macaluso, and Fabrizio Grossi. It released its first album in 2005. A second Starbreaker album, Love's Dying Wish, was released in 2008. The band never toured. A third Starbreaker album, Dysphoria, featuring Harnell and Karlsson among others, is scheduled for release in January 2019. =Sonic the Hedgehog= Harnell has done tracks for the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series. His first track for the series was \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" on the soundtrack of Sonic Adventure released in 1998 by SEGA. Harnell returned in 2001 to perform a rewritten version of the theme for Sonic in Sonic Adventure 2, as well as the first stage theme \\"Escape from the City\\" with Ted Poley. Following this in 2004, Harnell performed the Team Sonic theme for Sonic Heroes called \\"We Can\\", again with Poley and in 2011 he returned for Sonic Generations to perform two new remixes of \\"Escape from the City\\" with Poley. =Solo career= In 2008, Harnell released his first solo material in demo form, the EP Cinematic, through his website. It was followed in 2010 by the Round Trip album under the name Tony Harnell & The Mercury Train, a collection of re-recordings of classic Harnell songs from his previous bands TNT and Westworld in a stripped-down acoustic format. Harnell released the digital single \\"Take What You're Giving\\" in 2011 before teaming up with guitarist Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal and others for the Tony Harnell & the Wildflowers featuring Bumblefoot album in 2013. =Skid Row= On April 6, 2015, it was announced that Johnny Solinger had left the American heavy metal band Skid Row.

The Greek rebel forces were being besieged inside the Acropolis of Athens by Ottoman forces under the command of Mehmed Reshid Pasha. Greek forces outside the city were desperately trying to break the siege.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 176-178 Battle In order to break the siege of Acropolis, the British officers Admiral Lord Cochrane and General Richard Church, who were nominally commanding the Greeks, decided to make an assault against the Turkish camp which was under the command of Mehmed Reshid Pasha.David Brewer, The Greek War of Independence, p 301-303 Two days before the battle, on 22 April 1827, Georgios Karaiskakis, the general of Central Greece was fatally wounded in a minor clash with the Ottomans. He perished one day later, his sudden death seriously damaged Greek morale and emboldened the Turks.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 176-178 The battle began on 24 April, 3,000 men were ordered to advance across the plain. Their plan was to send 7,000 more men who were at Piraeus to attack the Ottomans from the flanks. Karaiskakis had proposed the day before instead of a direct attack, to cut the supply lines of the Ottomans in eastern Greece, but his proposal was not accepted.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 176-178 As the Greeks advanced from Phaleron, Reshid sent some cavalry to attack the Greeks. He expected the main assault to come from Piraeus. The troops from Piraeus did not arrive and the rest of the Greeks were attacked by the Ottoman cavalry.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 176-178 The Greek army was totally destroyed and its troops scattered. All Souliotes and Cretans fell, 22 Phillelenes, 270 regular soldiers, hundreds of irregulars and the Greek chieftains Ioannis Notaras, Lampros Veikos, Georgios Drakos, Georgios Tzavelas and Tousias Botsaris were killed by the cavalry attack.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 178 In total, the Greeks lost either 1,500 or 2,000 men, which was a devastating setback. The battle of Phaleron was seen as the greatest Greek defeat in the war of Independence. The men in the Acropolis surrendered on 5 June and were escorted by the French army to the coast. This defeat destroyed Greek morale and the only places on mainland Greece that persevered after the battle were Mani and Nafplio, seat of the government.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 176-178 Aftermath Later that year, the Great Powers, Imperial Russia, France, and Great Britain destroyed the Egyptian and Ottoman fleets in the Battle of Navarino.

It is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game. Dino Stalker is the third entry in the Capcom's Gun Survivor series after Resident Evil Survivor 2 ‚Äì Code: Veronica. Although the Gun Survivor games are an offshoot of the Resident Evil series, Dino Stalker is the only game in the series without any ties to Resident Evil (with the exception of two easter eggs in Stage 5, one involving the \\"woman drawing water\\" statue from the mansion in the first game, and an Umbrella building). It was followed by Resident Evil: Dead Aim. Gameplay Dino Stalker is a first-person shooter in which the player must use various weapons to defend against dinosaurs while progressing through the game. Dino Stalker supports the optional use of the GunCon light gun accessory. The player can use a variety of weapons throughout the game, including bazookas, machine guns, and shotguns, but can only carry one weapon at a time. The game takes place across various landscapes, including desert and jungle. A two-player mode is unlocked upon completion of the game. The game's storyline focuses on Mike Wired, a World War II pilot. After being shot down during combat over the Atlantic, Mike is transported into the dinosaur-populated future from Dino Crisis 2. Plot Mike Wired, a World War II era fighter pilot is about to die in the sky in 1943, as bullets approach him before he can parachute to safety. Mike mysteriously somehow ends up being transported to a time with flying dinosaurs, which he manages to kill. He meets Paula, a survivor from Dino Crisis 2 who speaks some English but is not able to speak long sentences. Traversing through the various stages under the guidance of Paula's father, Dylan, Mike defeats many different groups of savage dinosaurs using a special gun he gained, finally battling and defeating their intelligent leader, Trinity, which controlled the other dinosaurs. But despite falling in love with Paula, Mike must go back to just before his imminent death. Paula then edits the timescale to make the bullets vanish to prevent Mike from dying, and he is rescued by men on a boat, realizing that Paula was the one who saved him. Reception Dino Stalker received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. On release, Famitsu gave the game a score of 30 out of 40 in Japan. Douglass C. Perry of IGN criticized the game's controls: \\"After the first mission, your hand is in pain. The Carpel Tunnel syndrome you didn't have before throbs in fiery extended agony as if to say hello, and you have just started. [...] In the dozen-plus levels you play through, the slow-paced, awkward control is not only annoying but it hurts you. [...] But at least there is some comic relief, and for the pure sake of flat-out lunacy, this game may be worth your while.\\" Perry also criticized the game's poor graphics, writing that it \\"looks like it was designed as a PlayStation game and that it only recently made the transition to PlayStation 2. [...] It's an average looking game at best, and that's putting it nicely.\\" Ryan Davis of GameSpot called the game's premise \\"bizarre and convoluted\\" with \\"not a lot of coherence.\\" Davis criticized the game's selectable control schemes. Playing exclusively with the GunCon 2, Davis wrote that \\"using a single hand to move and shoot is difficult and will wear out your arm more quickly than your average light-gun game.\\" Davis also criticized the alternative method of using a standard DualShock controller: \\"the targeting reticle is far too sensitive, and you'll often find yourself dealing with bouts of overcorrection while trying to draw a bead on a dino.\\" Davis noted that the best option was to utilize both the DualShock and the GunCon 2 simultaneously, \\"But even this configuration does not compensate completely for the game's inherently slow movement or the inability to look up or down, and you'll spend an equal amount of time-fighting the controls as you will fighting dinosaurs.\\" Davis also criticized the game's poor graphics, and wrote that the only notable sound effect throughout the game \\"is the 'reload' command you'll hear whenever you're out of bullets, and this is only because the computer voice noticeably mispronounces it.\\" Davis concluded that the game would have been \\"infinitely more playable had Capcom discarded the Gun Survivor control scheme and just left the movement control on rails, like all other light-gun games. But with its needlessly frustrating control scheme intact, Dino Stalker's appeal is incredibly limited. Though the game is loosely affiliated with the Dino Crisis games, there's not a lot here to draw fans of that series, and with several superior light-gun games available on the PlayStation 2, there's little reason for anyone without a masochistic streak to play this game.\\" Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the music and graphics and wrote that the control scheme \\"isn't bad, but it does take some getting used to. It's worth getting used to though, because this is the best dino-hunting game I've played since Dino Crisis 2.\\" Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer called it \\"easily the best yet\\" in the Gun Survivor series, and praised the game for \\"some stunning environments,\\" but criticized its short length and some of the \\"rather bland\\" dinosaur designs.

Administratively, it is part of the Sha Tin District. It is one of Hong Kong's most prominent examples of new town developments in the 1970s. Together with its satellite town Ma On Shan, Shatin is the most populous city in the New Territories, with a 2011 population census of 630,273 within an area of . Situated in the southern half of New Territories East below Tolo Harbour, it is the principal city of Sha Tin District, which is the second most populous district of the territory. The city was founded in 1973 under the New Towns Development Programme of the Hong Kong government. Its current name was named after the nearby village of Sha Tin Wai. Housing the industrial area of Fo Tan, Shatin's economy once heavily relied on manufacturing, logistics and transportation. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone an extensive transition into areas such as business, service, tourism, entertainment, culture, education, sports, technology and scientific research. This has been marked by the building of Sha Tin Racecourse, Hong Kong Sports Institute and the Hong Kong Science Park in its outskirts. History Tai Wai Village, located in Tai Wai, next to Sha Tin, and the oldest and largest walled village in Sha Tin District, was built in 1574, during the Ming Dynasty. Before British rule in Hong Kong, the area of Sha Tin and its vicinity was referred to as Lek Yuen (lit. \\"source of trickling\\" or \\"source of clear water\\"). Colonial officials allegedly mistook the name of the Sha Tin Wai village as the name of the area and it has been used ever since. Nowadays, the original name is used to refer to Lek Yuen Estate. Sha Tin was formerly a market town at the present location of Sha Tin Centre Street and New Town Plaza shopping centre, near the Sha Tin Station of the MTR East Rail Line. Sha Tin was the location of the first flight of a powered aircraft in Hong Kong in 1911. The aeroplane was named as the Spirit of Sha Tin (). A full size replica of this plane now hangs in Hong Kong International Airport. The area was formerly agricultural farmland. Before Sha Tin's development into a new town, Hung Mui Kuk (), southwest of Sha Tin, was perennially the main site for school picnics. The hillside area remains a popular barbecue site. Starting in the 1970s, the area became part of the Sha Tin New Town development. Since then, the economy in the area has greatly improved and living standards have also increased. Sha Tin Town Centre was developed during the mid-1980s to help \\"link the town's currently dispersed residents into one cohesive community.\\" The 18-hectare site, adjacent to the railway station, was built up in stages to house an array of uses including the New Town Plaza, numerous smaller shopping centres, Sha Tin Park, magistracy, library, town hall, marriage registry, hotel, New Town Tower, a town square, and residential towers. Geography Sha Tin New Town under development in the late 1970s. Sha Tin is located in a valley, on both sides of the Shing Mun River, running from the southwest to the northeast. It is bordered by Tai Wai in the southwest and by Fo Tan (left bank) and Shek Mun (right bank) in the northeast. = Cross-border activities = Due to their proximity to the Shenzhen border, towns in the northern parts of Hong Kong, notably Sheung Shui and Yuen Long, have become hubs for parallel traders who have been buying up large quantities of goods, forcing up local prices and disrupting the daily lives of local citizens.\\"ËøëÁôæÂêç‰∫∫Âà∞‰∏äÊ∞¥Á§∫Â®Å‰∏çÊªøÂÖßÂú∞Ê∞¥Ë≤®ÂÆ¢\\". now.com. 15 September 2012.

The 8-hectare Sha Tin Park was opened to public in 1988. Apart from its horticultural gardens and impressive water features, it also includes a large open plaza and a bandstand. The Ma On Shan Park, which is adjacent to Ma On Shan Swimming Pool, occupies 5.5 hectare of land. The Sha Tin Racecourse, occupying approximately 70 hectares, rests on reclaimed flatland. At the centre of the racecourse is the Penfold Garden which opens to the public on non-racing days. Located in Tai Wai, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum was opened at the end of 2000. Apart from introducing the art, culture and history of the New Territories, the museum also exhibits a variety of cultural artifacts for public appreciation. The museum, which can accommodate 6,000 visitors, is the largest in the territory.left The Heritage Museum.Cycling has been a distinctive feature in Sha Tin and is very popular among both local people and visitors. The first cycle track in Sha Tin was opened to public in 1981, running along Tolo Highway to Tai Po, and this remains the territory's most popular cycling venue, drawing many occasional riders at the weekends, as well as dedicated cyclists. To tie in with the development of Ma On Shan, the cycle track was extended to Ma On Shan. Hiking is also a wonderful activity you could do in your leisure time living in Sha Tin. There are several starting points including Hin Tin Village, Sha Tin Tau Village and hung mui kuk barbecue area leading to the track of Lion Rock Mountain hiking route. It would take you 1 hour to 4 hours to complete the track depends on the starting point and ending point you choose.  Local delicacies  A snacks stall in Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery. Sha Tin is famous for certain local variants of Cantonese food such as ShanSui Tofu (), barbecued pigeon and chicken congee. The cooked food stalls in Wo Che Estate and Fo Tan are hotspots for food. Transportation Roads leading to the Shui Chuen O outskirts. Sha Tin railway station There are numerous transportation links both within the Sha Tin District and connecting it to other places in Hong Kong. =Roads= The road network in Sha Tin is well developed to provide efficient cross-town and local access traffic. Connection between Sha Tin and Kowloon mainly relies on the Lion Rock Tunnel, Tate's Cairn Tunnel, Shing Mun Tunnel and Tai Po Road which makes it easy to reach from many areas of Kowloon as well as from Tsuen Wan. *Tai Po Road spans from Sham Shui Po in Kowloon to Tai Po in the New Territories, connecting Sha Tin en route. It was once the only road connecting Kowloon and the eastern part of the New Territories. *Opened in the 1960s, the Lion Rock Tunnel offers access to Central Kowloon. *The Tate's Cairn Highway was completed in 1991, connecting East Kowloon (Wong Tai Sin, Diamond Hill, Choi Hung, Kowloon Bay, and Kwun Tong) and Hong Kong Island via the Eastern Harbour Crossing with the North East New Territories (Sha Tin, Tai Po and Fanling) via the Tolo Highway and through Tate's Cairn Tunnel. *Route connects Sha Tin to Tsuen Wan via the Shing Mun Tunnels and to Hong Kong Island via the Western Harbour Crossing. The travelling time is only about 30 minutes. *Sai Sha Road was opened in 1988, connecting Sha Tin to Sai Kung via Ma On Shan. Route T7, opened in August 2004, allows traffic to bypass Ma On Shan Town Centre when going from north of Ma On Shan to Sai Kung. *An expressway (via Eagle's Nest Tunnel) connecting Cheung Sha Wan in Kowloon to Sha Tin was opened on March 21, 2008. It aims at distributing traffic from Sha Tin and the area to its north, to Lai Chi Kok, Kwai Chung, and the airport at Chek Lap Kok and Mong Kok It has shorten the trip from Sha Tin to the Chek Lap Kok International Airport to around 40 minutes. At present, there are over 110 routes of public bus serving Sha Tin. =Railway= *The MTR (East Rail Line) is a major means of transportation between Kowloon and Lo Wu via Sha Tin. After the electrification of the Line between 1979 and 1983, the East Rail now carries over 730,000 passengers daily. *The Ma On Shan Line opened on 21 December 2004. The 11.4 km long railway has 9 stations linking Ma On Shan and Tai Wai, where it connects with the main East Rail line (terminus). The MTR Maintenance Centre is located in Tai Wai. *Sha Tin to Central Link () is a railway project under construction which incorporates an extension to the Ma On Shan Line to Hung Hom via Kai Tak, as well as an extension of the East Rail Line to Central via a new tunnel under the harbour.  Architecture  While having been mass developed in the 1970s, Shatin's architecture maintains a degree of diversity. Most public housing estates developed in the era followed the UK's Brutalist architecture. Several shopping centres, hotels and government buildings around Shatin Central are cladded in red brick and resemble styles of American Modernism.

It was established in its current form by the Police Force (Jersey) Law, 1974 and consists of around 240 officers. This was some 130 years after the need for a full-time force was identified. A body of paid and uniformed town police was set up in Saint Helier in 1854, which became the nucleus of the Paid Police established to operate Island-wide in 1951 by the Paid Police Force (Jersey) Law. The Paid Police was renamed the States of Jersey Police in 1960. The States Police supports the system of elected Honorary Police in each parish that has been in place in the Island since 1204. States of Jersey Police community outreach: a crime prevention information stand at the 2012 West Show The States of Jersey Police are the only officers with Island-wide powers and provide a professional response to all serious crime in the Island. Under a memorandum of understanding with the twelve parish forces the latter routinely handle minor matters and traffic control, but Centeniers remain the only officers able to bring charges. The fictional Bureau des √âtrangers department of the States of Jersey Police featured in the British TV series Bergerac. Notable investigations An investigation into allegations of historical child abuse had begun in 2006. Several sites in the grounds of Haut de la Garenne, a former children's home, were excavated in 2008 and finds of human remains and other items were announced amid sensational international publicity. In September 2008, Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police took over as Senior Investigating Officer in the abuse enquiry. In August 2008 David Warcup, Deputy Chief Constable of Northumbria Police, took over as Deputy Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police. The new team launched a review of the investigation to date and subsequently in November 2008, the Deputy Chief Officer, David Warcup, expressed \\"much regret\\" that misleading information had been released throughout the conduct of the enquiry and that there was \\"no evidence\\" of any child murders at Haut de la Garenne. Detective Superintendent Gradwell retired in August 2009 at the end of his contract and returned to the UK. On retiring, he described the investigation prior to the time he took over as a \\"poorly managed mess\\" and, in particular, the decision to excavate at Haut de la Garenne as being without justification and as \\"a complete and total waste of public money, time and effort\\". As a result of the wider investigation, disregarding the controversial excavations at Haut de la Garenne, charges were brought against three individuals, and convictions obtained in court in 2009. =Suspension of Former Chief Officer= The former Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police, Graham Power, was suspended in November 2008 pending an inquiry into his handling of the historic abuse inquiry, in the wake of the public withdrawal by police of claims of evidence. In August 2009, it was announced that Graham Power, still on suspension but contesting his suspension through legal process, had been suspended again in relation to the keeping of secret files on politicians, an affair unrelated to the historic abuse inquiry. Graham Power later retired and was replaced in the interim by David Warcup, who subsequently announced his own departure in July 2010. Headquarters The States of Jersey Police HQ on La Route du Fort in St. Helier. In 2013, plans to build a new headquarters building were approved. The new building which supersedes the old headquarters located in Rouge Bouillon, was opened on 7 March 2017, and sits on land which was occupied by a part of Green Street car park.

This is performed using a hot or very cold branding iron. It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved, oppressed, or otherwise controlled person. It may also be practiced as a \\"rite of passage\\", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization. Modern strike branding Etymology The English verb to burn, attested since the 12th century, is a combination of Old Norse brenna \\"to burn, light\\", and two originally distinct Old English verbs: b√¶rnan \\"to kindle\\" (transitive) and beornan \\"to be on fire\\" (intransitive), both from the Proto-Germanic root bren(wanan), perhaps from a Proto-Indo- European root bhre-n-u, from base root bhereu- \\"to boil forth, well up.\\" In Dutch, (ver)branden mean \\"to burn\\", brandmerk a branded mark; similarly, in German, Brandzeichen means \\"a brand\\" and brandmarken, \\"to brand\\". Sometimes, the word cauterize is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French cauteriser from Late Latin cauterizare \\"to burn or brand with a hot iron\\", itself from Greek Œ∫Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ¨Œ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ, kauteriazein, from Œ∫Œ±œÖœÑŒÆœÅ kauter \\"burning or branding iron\\", from Œ∫Œ±ŒØŒµŒπŒΩ kaiein \\"to burn\\". However cauterization is now generally understood to mean a medical process ‚Äì specifically to stop bleeding. Historical use =Marking the rightless= Branding of a naked female slave in Africa The origin may be the ancient treatment of a slave (often without legal rights) as livestock. *European, American and other colonial slavers branded millions of slaves during the period of trans-Atlantic enslavement. Sometimes there were several brandings, e.g. for the Portuguese crown and the (consecutive) private owner(s), an extra cross after baptism as well as by African slave catchers. * Ancient Romans marked runaway slaves with the letters FGV (for fugitivus). * An intermediate case between formal slavery and criminal law is when a convict is branded and legally reduced, with or without time limit, to a slave-like status, such as on the galleys (in France branded GAL or TF travaux forc√©s 'forced labour' until 1832), in a penal colony, or auctioned to a private owner. =As punishment= Branding of the Huguenot John Leclerc during the 16th century persecutions. Whipping and branding of thieves in Denmark, 1728 In criminal law, branding with a hot iron was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals, sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life. Brand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining physical punishment, as burns are very painful, with public humiliation (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible criminal record. Robbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (fur); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under Constantine I the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf. The Acts of Sharbil record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in Parthian Edessa at the time of the Roman Emperor Trajan on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice. In the 16th century, German Anabaptists were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the Roman Catholic church.Edward Bean Underhill, Martyrology of the Churches of Christ Commonly Called Baptists during the Era of the Reformation, (1850), pg 118 In the North-American Puritan settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for adultery were branded with an \\"A\\" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as \\"D\\" for drunkenness and \\"B\\" for blasphemy. The mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for Desertion, BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a penal colony). Branding was used for a time by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Surgeon and Oxford English Dictionary contributor William Chester Minor was required to brand deserters at around the time of the Battle of the Wilderness. Until 1832 in France, various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a fleur de lis and galley-slaves could be branded GAL or, once the galleys were replaced by the bagnes on land, TF (travaux forc√©s, 'forced' labor, i.e. hard labour) or TFP (travaux forc√©s √† perpetuit√©, hard labour for life). In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. Following the Conspiracy of the Slaves of 1749 in Malta, some slaves were branded with the letter R (for ribelli) on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life. Branding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under sharia law), sooner and more widely than flogging, caning, and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial knout) can even turn out to cause death. =Branding in American slavery= A replica of a slave branding iron originally used in the Atlantic slave trade, on display at the Museum of Liverpool, England. Depiction of slave branding, from Illustrations of the American Anti-slavery Almanac for 1840 In Louisiana, there was a \\"black code\\", or Code Noir, which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and hamstringing, the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron. Branding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, was looking for his slave and described, \\"I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M.\\" Most slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in Kentucky around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having \\"a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched.\\" In South Carolina, there were many laws which permitted the punishments slaves would receive. When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway. =As religious initiation= Ceremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most Vaishnava sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad Panchratra, Vaikhnasagama, Skanda Purana etc. This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of Karnataka in India. =Branding in Britain= The punishment was adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the Statute of Vagabonds (1547) under King Edward VI, vagabonds and Gypsies were ordered to be branded with a large V on the breast, and brawlers with F for \\"fraymaker\\"; slaves who ran away were branded with S on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of Henry VII, branding was inflicted for all offences which received Benefit of clergy (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at Old Bailey to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or larceny, who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be \\"burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose.\\" This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. James Nayler, a Quaker who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the Messiah, was convicted of blasphemy in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded B for \\"blasphemer\\". In the Lancaster Criminal Court, a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an M (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming \\"A fair mark, my lord.\\" Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted. In the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. \\"When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a duel and killed his man in Hyde Park. Found guilty of manslaughter he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron\\" (Markham's Ancient Punishments of Northants, 1886). Such cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of deserters from the army, who were marked with the letter D, not with hot irons but by tattooing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with BC (bad character). The British Mutiny Act of 1858 provided that the court-martial might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2 inches (5 cm) below the armpit, with the letter D, such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished. =Branding in Australia= Offenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‚Äòsentenced to be burnt in the hand‚Äô. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O‚ÄôNeil was tattooed with the letter ‚ÄòD‚Äô. =Branding in Russia= Branding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863. =Branding prostitutes= Forced and enslaved prostitutes have often been tattooed or branded with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into prostitution would have their boss‚Äôs name or gang symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the trafficking of women and girls like the mafias nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some pimps and organisations use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.CNN: Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims The branding is both painful and humiliating for the victim, especially when done with a branding iron, and may be also a form of punishment and of psychological submission for the prostitutes. Some years ago the brands were usually small, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the inner vaginal lips, though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger, more noticeable brands.Irish Mirror: Pictured: Trafficked prostitutes BRANDED by pimps to show they ‚Äòown‚Äô them Persisting practices * Generally voluntary, though often under severe social pressure, branding may be used as a painful form of initiation, serving both as endurance and motivation test (rite of passage) and a permanent membership mark, seen as male bonding. Branding is thus practiced: ** By some street gangs ** In organized crime as \\"stripes\\" to signify a violent crime that the person committed. Typically on the upper arm or upper torso. ** In prisons ** Sometimes as an extreme initiation in the increasingly less common tradition of painful hazing (otherwise mostly paddling). ** Some members of college fraternities and sororities voluntarily elect to be branded with their fraternity/sorority letters. This is far less common in sororities than fraternities and is especially prevalent in some historically African-American fraternities, such as Omega Psi Phi.Posey, Sandra, \\"Burning Messages: Interpreting African American Fraternity Brands and Their Bearers \\", New York Folklore Society Voices, Fall-Winter 2004. * Branding can be used as a voluntary body decoration ‚Äì a form of permanent body art rather like many tattoos. Protests In symbolic solidarity with Calf 269, protesters in Israel subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day (Gandhi's birthday): October 2, 2012. This act was emulated by others in England and the Czech Republic. An English protester who was interviewed justified the extremism as a reaction to the extreme cruelty perpetrated by the dairy industry such as shooting calves at birth.

It is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, but has spread to many other locations, including North America, Australia, and the Philippines. The small hive beetle can be a destructive pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to comb, stored honey, and pollen. If a beetle infestation is sufficiently heavy, they may cause bees to abandon their hive. Its presence can also be a marker in the diagnosis of colony collapse disorder for honey bees. The beetles can also be a pest of stored combs, and honey (in the comb) awaiting extraction. Beetle larvae may tunnel through combs of honey, feeding and defecating, causing discoloration and fermentation of the honey. Distribution The small hive beetle was first discovered in the United States in 1996 and has now spread to many U.S. states including, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The movement of migratory beekeepers from Florida may have transported the beetle to other states. Recent findings also indicate transport of the beetles in packages. Mark Welsch, Beekeeper and member of the Omaha Bee Club added Iowa and Nebraska from personal observation and discussions with other beekeepers. In Canada, the small hive beetle has been detected in Manitoba (2002 and 2006), Alberta (2006), Qu√©bec (2008, 2009), Ontario (2010), British Columbia (2015), and New Brunswick (2017). In the Prairie Provinces, measures were taken to control the pest, and small hive beetles failed to establish a population. It is still to be determined whether the small hive beetle has been able to establish a resident population in Ontario or Qu√©bec. In the summer of 2015, the discovery of a number of adult beetles as well as one infestation in all stages of brood in British Columbia's Fraser Valley triggered a temporary quarantine. In Mexico, the small hive beetle has become established in at least eight states. Infestation levels are especially high in tropical areas such as the Yucat√°n. The small hive beetle was first detected in Belize in 2016 in the Corozal District. The small hive beetle has also spread to Australia, being first identified at Richmond, NSW in 2002. Subsequently, it has affected many areas of Queensland and New South Wales. It seems plausible to assume that the import of package bees, honeybee or bumblebee colonies, queens, hive equipment or even soil constituted the potential invasion pathway of the small hive beetle; however, at the current state of evidence it is still unclear how small hive beetles actually reached Australia. The small hive beetle has now reached the southern Philippines in southern Mindanao, and there is great concern that it will spread through the country if hives and bees are moved from the southern Mindanao area where the beetle has already been identified. Since 2015 the beetle is present in Southern Italy (Calabria and Sicily) and some areas have been quarantined.  Life history  Aethina tumida was previously known only from the sub-Saharan regions of Africa where it has been considered a minor pest of bees. The life cycle information is known primarily from studies in South Africa. The small hive beetle is a member of the family of scavengers or sap beetles. The adult beetle is dark brown to black and about 5‚Äì6 mm in length. The adults may live up to 6 months and can be observed almost anywhere in a hive, although they are most often found on the rear portion of the bottom board of a hive. Female beetles lay irregular masses of eggs in cracks or crevices in a hive. The eggs hatch in 2‚Äì3 days into white-colored larvae that will grow to 10‚Äì11 mm in length. Larvae feed on pollen and honey, damaging combs, and require about 10‚Äì16 days to mature. Larvae that are ready to pupate leave the hive and burrow into soil near the hive. The pupation period may last approximately 3‚Äì4 weeks. Newly emerged adults seek out hives, and females generally mate and begin egg laying about a week after emergence. Adult female small hive beetles generally are longer at 5.7 mm than males which are 5.5 mm long, but both are nearly identical in width at about 3.2 mm, although they can vary greatly in size, possibly depending on diet, climate, and other environmental factors.Ellis J, Ellis A,. (2010). Small hive beetle, Aethina tumida (Murray). Featured Creatures. 6 July 2010. Hive beetles may have 4‚Äì5 generations a year during the warmer seasons.  Damage to colonies and stored honey  Comb slimed by hive beetle larvae. Hives infested at this level will drive out bee colonies. The primary damage to colonies and stored honey caused by the small hive beetle is through the feeding activity of the larvae. Larvae tunnel through comb with stored honey or pollen, damaging or destroying cappings and comb. Larvae defecate in honey, and the honey becomes discolored from the feces. Activity of the larvae causes fermentation and a frothiness in the honey; the honey develops a characteristic odor of decaying oranges. Damage and fermentation cause honey to run out of combs, creating a mess in hives or extracting rooms. Heavy infestations cause bees to abscond; some beekeepers have reported the rapid collapse of even strong colonies.  Control  The small hive beetle is considered a secondary pest in South Africa, and as such, has not been the subject of major control efforts. The beetle is most often found in weak or failing hives and rarely affects strong hives. However, differences in the housecleaning traits of the bees found in South Africa and the U.S. may mean very different responses to the beetles. Some early reports from Florida and South Carolina suggest the beetles may be more damaging there than in Africa. Para-dichlorobenzene (PDB) has been used for protecting empty stored combs. Coumaphos bee strips (Bayer Corporation) have been approved for use in hives for the control of small hive beetles in some states under an emergency registration. Biological control through beneficial soil nematodes specific to the SHB is also effective. Beneficial nematodes are used by applying them to the soil while suspended in water. They may be applied as a pressurized spray or simply poured from a watering can. Nematodes applied to the soil, burrow downward in search of insect pests. Once found, nematodes enter the body of the insect and release a powerful bacterium which quickly kills the pest. Released bacteria dissolve the internal tissues of the insect which becomes food for nematode growth and development. Matured nematodes then mate and lay eggs to produce more nematodes within the dead insect. Several such generations may occur over just a few days. After the inside of an insect is consumed, tiny infective stage nematodes leave the dead insect shell and begin searching for more pests. As many as 350,000 nematodes may emerge from a single dead insect after only 10‚Äì15 days. Numbers depend on insect size. There are also several traps currently on the market. The more effective ones are the Beetlejail Baitable, Hood Trap, the Freeman Beetle Trap, the West trap, the Australian, AJ's Beetle Eater, and the Beetle Blaster.Hood, Michael Integrated Pest Management Dept. of Entomology, Soils, and Plant Sciences Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina June 2010 All these traps use non- toxic oil to suffocate the beetles. This allows beekeepers to avoid having toxic chemicals in their beehives.  Regulations  In New South Wales, Australia, infestation of hives by small hive beetle is notifiable as a honey bee pest under the Stock Diseases Act 1923. The maximum penalty for failing to notify is $11,000.

Neils Thompson sought to lease and eventually purchase the site for the University. The lease agreement was reached in 1946, and certain research projects began to be moved to the new campus. In 1949, with the help of then-Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson, the University purchased the site, now named the Off-Campus Research Center (OCRC), from the federal government. In 1953, it became the Balcones Research Center, so named for the Balcones Escarpment which runs through that part of the city. Over the years, the University continued to develop the campus, whose tenants made significant contributions to research in the areas of defense, nuclear physics, and space flight. It received a clear title to the property in 1971, and in 1974 purchased another tract of land west of the railroad, bringing the site to its current area. The University again renamed the campus in 1994, this time for former Congressman and UT alumnus J. J. Pickle. When he was Austin's congressional representative, Pickle was instrumental in bringing major research efforts to the campus. Pickle died in 2005. Campus The Pickle Research Campus is not a full college campus: there are no dormitories, and most classes held there are for working professional programs (such as the Executive Masters program). Other than normal campus operations and a cafeteria / conference center, it is strictly a research facility. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the research being done at the PRC, it is also a closed campus. On a normal weekday, access to the campus is restricted to University students, faculty, and staff with parking permits, as well as expected guests. After hours or on weekends, access is restricted to approved personnel only. A shuttle runs between the two campuses on weekdays. Many students and some faculty/staff, especially those living in north Austin, opt to park at PRC and ride the shuttle due to the limited parking on the main campus. Today, the campus houses approximately 100 buildings. Many of the campus's original 29 buildings, most of which were built in the early 1940s, are still in use today. The vast majority of the campus is contained on the original site. Additionally, part of the west tract between Loop 1 and US 183 has been leased to retailers such as Office Depot. In 2003, the UT System Board of Regents and Simon Property Group reached a $130 million lease agreement under which Simon would build a shopping mall on 46 acres (186,000 m¬≤) of unused PRC land along Loop 1 and across from another Simon Property Group venture - the Domain. Construction on the Arbor Walk began in 2005, with its first retail stores opening in October 2006. Despite all this, a significant amount of the campus remains undeveloped. While there are roads throughout the campus, many of them border empty plots of land. UT administrators have announced plans to eventually develop the PRC into a full- fledged campus, but they are only preliminary. Visitors will also observe numerous bluebonnets, the Texas state flower, at the PRC. They are visible outside the campus from Burnet Road, but can be found in various places throughout the site.

One tale of Abarta's trickery is where he offered himself as a servant to Fionn mac Cumhaill, shortly after Mac Cumhaill had succeeded his father as leader of the Fianna, a band of mighty Milesian warriors. In a gesture of goodwill, Abarta then gave them a wild grey horse, which fourteen Fianna had to mount onto its back before it would even move. After Abarta had mounted behind the Fianna on the horse, it galloped off taking the warriors to the Otherworld where the Tuatha D√© Danann had been driven underground by the Milesians.

SMI-S is based upon the Common Information Model and the Web-Based Enterprise Management standards defined by the Distributed Management Task Force, which define management functionality via HTTP. The most recent approved version of SMI-S is available on the SNIA website.. The main objective of SMI-S is to enable broad interoperable management of heterogeneous storage vendor systems. The current version is SMI-S 1.8.0 Rev 4. Over 1,350 storage products are certified as conformant to SMI-S.. Basic concepts SMI-S defines CIM management profiles for storage systems. The entire SMI Specification is categorized in profiles and subprofiles. A profile describes the behavioral aspects of an autonomous, self-contained management domain. SMI-S includes profiles for Arrays, Switches, Storage Virtualizers, Volume Management and several other management domains. In DMTF parlance, an SMI-S provider is an implementation for a specific profile or set of profiles. A subprofile describes a part of a management domain, and can be a common part in more than one profile. At a very basic level, SMI-S entities are divided into two categories: * Clients are management software applications that can reside virtually anywhere within a network, provided they have a communications link (either within the data path or outside the data path) to providers. * Servers are the devices under management. Servers can be disk arrays, virtualization engines, host bus adapters, switches, tape drives, etc. SMI-S timeline * 2000 ‚Äì Collection of computer storage industry leaders led by Roger Reich begins building an interoperable management backbone for storage and storage networks (named Bluefin) in a small consortia called the Partner Development Process. * 2002 ‚Äì Bluefin donated by the consortia to the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) and later renamed to Storage Management Initiative ‚Äì Specification or SMI-S.

The game was released on Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo DS. It is the second open world Spider-Man video game, after 2004's Spider-Man 2, and features a similar gameplay, allowing the players to freely explore Manhattan and parts of Queens, while engaging in various side activities. The game introduces Venom as a playable character in addition to Spider-Man, who has his own play style and series of missions. Set within the Ultimate Marvel universe, the game's main storyline sees Spider-Man investigating the corrupt Trask Industries and its connection to the creation of the Venom symbiote and his parents' death, while facing off against various supervillains, including Venom, who has his personal vendetta against Bolivar Trask. A prequel, Spider- Man: Battle for New York, was released in 2006. Gameplay Ultimate Spider- Man is a third-person action-adventure video game, set in an open world based on Manhattan and parts of Queens. Players take on the role of Spider-Man or Venom and complete missions‚Äîlinear scenarios with set objectives‚Äîto progress through the story. The player starts in story-mode where they can only free roam as Spider-Man, and the game automatically switches between Spider-Man and Venom during missions. After the main story is complete, the player can switch between the two characters at any time, and free roam as Venom. The two characters play differently from one another. Spider-Man is more agile and uses webs to travel through the city, being able to either web swing or web zip; similarly to Spider-Man 2, the player needs to be close to buildings and manually attach webs to them. Spider-Man can also use his webs during fights, immobilizing enemies for a few seconds, or grabbing and throwing them around. Once an enemy is down, the player needs to quickly web them in order to immobilize them for good, otherwise they will get up and continue attacking the player. Venom is much more aggressive and uses his tentacles to pull himself to buildings, much like Spider-Man's web zip. He can perform massive jumps and grab enemies, whom he can either throw away, crush against the ground, or consume. While playing as Venom, players can consume non-player characters to regenerate their health; normal pedestrians usually grant the player more health than enemies. While free roaming as Venom, he will slowly lose health regardless of taking damage or not, requiring the player to often consume people to regenerate health. Venom can throw cars and go on destructive rampages, earning police attention. The more destruction Venom causes, the more police will attempt to stop him. As the game progresses, Spider-Man and Venom will have certain \\"City Goals\\" to accomplish in order to continue the storyline. These consist of various side missions, such as races, combat tours, and collectibles. =Game Boy Advance version= The Game Boy Advance version of Ultimate Spider-Man is a side-scroller beat 'em up, divided into seven \\"issues\\", each containing three chapters. Both Spider-Man and Venom are playable, and each has his own series of levels. In addition to the two main characters, the game features three additional bosses: Shocker, Silver Sable, and Carnage. This version includes a limited supply of Spider-Man's web fluid, which can be refilled by picking up special markers scattered throughout levels or dropped by enemies. Additionally, players may choose to collect hidden power-ups to gain more web fluid capacity or gain moves and abilities for both Spider-Man and Venom. =Nintendo DS version= The Nintendo DS version of Ultimate Spider-Man is a side-scroller beat 'em up, albeit it features a 3D environment. Both Spider-Man and Venom are playable, and each play differently from the other. In the Spider-Man levels, most of the game happens on the top screen and the touch screen is only used for selecting special attacks and operating certain objects (moving heavy objects, opening broken elevator doors, etc.). In the Venom levels, the game switches to the touch screen, and players are able to grab and throw objects or enemies using Venom's tentacles, or attack by tapping the screen. The game also features a slightly modified storyline and a multiplayer mode, where players can unlock different characters and arenas for a head-to-head fight. Plot After explaining how he came to be Spider-Man, Peter Parker reveals that his and Eddie Brock's fathers worked together to find a cure for terminal diseases, and created a black liquid substance that can envelop one's body and heal them, in addition to enhancing their strength and other abilities. However, they were tricked into selling the \\"suit\\" to Trask Industries, and later died in a plane crash before they could complete work on it. Years later, Peter and Eddie reunite and discover the suit is their inheritance. After learning how his dad was tricked by Trask Industries, Spider-Man tries to take the suit and is covered by a portion of it. While it enhances his powers, the unstable suit tries to consume him, forcing Peter to remove it. Eddie feels betrayed upon learning how Peter tried to steal the suit and, after deducing his identity as Spider-Man, takes the rest of the suit for himself, becoming Venom. After a fight with Peter that results in Venom's death, Adrian Toomes, an employee of Bolivar Trask that witnessed their confrontation, contacts his boss to inform him of the suit's capabilities. Three months later, while Peter has returned to his normal life, Eddie has survived and has been forced to feed on the life energy of civilians to prevent the suit from consuming him. One night, he fights and defeats Wolverine. At Mary Jane Watson's pleads, Spider-Man investigates something rampaging through Queens, and discovers it to be R.H.I.N.O., a giant, rhinoceros-themed mecha suit, built by Trask Industries. While he defeats R.H.I.N.O. and leaves its pilot, Alex O'Hirn, for the police, Spider-Man fails to recognize the company's name. Elsewhere, Trask hires Silver Sable's Wild Pack to capture Eddie, but he defeats them as Venom and escapes. During a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Peter senses Venom's presence nearby and defeats him. Venom is captured by Sable, who Spider-Man assumes is working for S.H.I.E.L.D., and imprisoned inside an energy cage by Trask. Forced to test the Venom suit for him, he chases and defeats Electro, while protecting Spider-Man, who was knocked unconscious by Electro when he interfered. As S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and arrests Electro, Venom flees and Nick Fury wakes up Spider-Man, only for him to storm off after berating Fury over constantly interfering with his life. Eddie returns to Trask and informs him that he had more control over the suit in Spider-Man's presence. Remembering that Richard Parker's DNA was used as the basis of the suit, Trask concludes that Peter is Spider-Man and that getting some of his DNA will help stabilize the suit. Sable takes Eddie to track down Peter, but he transforms into Venom and escapes. Meanwhile the Beetle releases the Green Goblin and steals a vial containing a sample of the Sandman for his mysterious employer. After encountering Spider-Man, the Beetle flees to the Latverian Embassy. Nick Fury asks Spider-Man to infiltrate the Embassy, for the Goblin to emerge from inside. Spider-Man defeats him and he is arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. Venom defeats the Beetle when he attempts to collect a sample of the symbiote. Silver Sable kidnaps Peter and attempts to deliver him to Trask, but he escapes and fights her. Venom interferes and kidnaps Sable, forcing Spider-Man to chase and defeat him, but the battle leaves both exhausted, allowing Sable to deliver them to Trask. While Eddie is imprisoned, Peter is injected by Toomes with a makeshift sample of the Venom suit, transforming him into Carnage, who goes on a rampage. Venom escapes and defeats Carnage, before absorbing the symbiote off Peter, which gives him full control over the suit. Venom attempts to exact revenge on Trask, but Spider-Man goes to warn him, leading Trask to attempt to escape via helicopter. When Venom tries to destroy the helicopter, Spider-Man stops and defeats him. As S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and arrests Venom and Trask, Peter retrieves some files from the latter, which reveal that the plane crash that killed Peter's parents was caused by Eddie's father trying the Venom suit on board and losing control due to his incompatibility. After Peter tells Nick Fury that Eddie must see the files, he reveals that Eddie escaped. Days later, Venom kills Trask in prison, while Peter vocalizes his worries about Eddie to Mary Jane, saying that he is not sure if he is scared of Eddie, or for him. Elsewhere, a partially transformed Eddie leaps from a skyscraper, turning into Venom just before he hits the ground. Reception Ultimate Spider-Man received \\"generally positive\\" and \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. CiN Weekly gave it a score of 88 out of 100 and stated that \\"The true letdown... is that the master villains can still be supremely frustrating to defeat, requiring several replays and exhaustive bouts of highly patterned attacks\\". The New York Times gave it a positive-to-average review and said that the game was \\"very entertaining, and the addition of Nemesis creates some interesting new situations, but over all there isn't a lot of variety; you fight, you race, you ramble around the city, and then you do it all again\\". The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and stated that \\"combat against dim-witted goons can become repetitive but missions offer diversity\\". Prequel Spider-Man: Battle for New York, a side-scrolling beat 'em up where players can control both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, was released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS on November 14, 2006. The game is also set in the Ultimate Marvel universe, prior to the events of Ultimate Spider-Man.

He studied at the universities of Berlin, G√∂ttingen, Vienna, and Heidelberg, and began a practice in Karlsruhe in 1842. In 1849 he became a professor of theoretical medicine at the University of T√ºbingen, and in 1853 a professor of physiology. Vierordt developed techniques and tools for the monitoring of blood circulation. He is credited with the construction of an early \\"hemotachometer\\", an apparatus for monitoring the velocity of blood flow. In 1854, he created a device called a sphygmograph, a mechanism consisting of weights and levers used to estimate blood pressure, and considered to be a forerunner of the modern sphygmomanometer. One of his better known written works was a treatise on the arterial pulse, titled Die Lehre vom Arterienpuls in gesunden und kranken Zust√§nden. Vierordt also made substantial contributions to the psychology of time perception, via his book (published in 1868) Der Zeitsinn nach Versuchen, \\"The experimental study of the time sense\\". This reported a large number of experiments on the perception of duration, with the time sense being considered a \\"general sense\\" along with the perception of space, in contrast to the \\"special senses\\" such as vision and hearing. Included in this book is discussion of, and evidence for, what has come to be known as Vierordt's Law: roughly the proposition that short durations tend to be overestimated, while long durations tend to be underestimated. Between these two extremes is a \\"point of indifference\\" where the \\"time sensation\\", in Vierordt's terminology, corresponds exactly to physical time. However, the 1868 book does much more than report this \\"law\\" and contains extensive discussions of different methods used to measure duration perception, as well as different sorts of errors that can occur. Although Vierordt was not the first person to carry out experiments on time perception, his 1868 book involved much more extensive experimentation and discussion than had been carried out until then. He died in T√ºbingen, aged 66.

It is part of the Nagpur metropolitan region development authority. It is the administrative center for Kamptee taluka. It is below the confluence of the Kanhan River with the rivers Pench and Kolar. History Map of Nagpur district showing location of Kamptee. Kamptee was founded in 1821 when the British established a military cantonment on the banks of the Kanhan. Kamptee was previously named Camp-T for its shape. The town quickly became a center for trade, but trade dwindled with the arrival of the railway in the late 19th century. An Iron Age hoard of weapons was excavated by Major George Pearse of the Royal Artillery from the Wurreegaon barrow near Kamptee in the mid-nineteenth century. Dating to between the 7th and 1st centuries BCE, it was one of the first hoards from this period discovered in the Indian Sub-Continent. Geography National Highway No.7 passes through Kamptee. Three bridges cross the Kanhan river. One is a railway bridge, one is road N.H.7, and the third is a small road that goes to Old Kamptee. One water filter plant supplies the larger area of Nagpur city. Religion According to 2011 census of India, in Kamptee city Islam is the most popular religion with approximately 43.18% following it Hinduism is followed by 34.14% of population. 21.78% population follows Buddhism, and Christianity and Sikhism having approximately 0.21% and 0.28% population respectively.

The area hosts a Roman Catholic establishment of the Order of St. Francis de Sales, with a church and convent. Immaculate Conception Church, the oldest church in central India, was built in 1820 and sits in the cantonment area. Buddhists built the Dragon Palace Temple in 1999. Around 1,000,000 Buddhists annually gather at Dragon Palace. A Jain temple is around one thousand years old. It is full of sculptures and carvings; it depicts Ramayan and Mahabharat. A 1,000-year-old Jain mandir is iat Lala oli. It is said that the Shikar of the Jain temple is nearly 300 years old. The temple was renovated by the Bhosale King of Nagpur in the eighteenth century. An idol in the image of Jain Tteerthankar Munisuvatnath was found hidden in a small room below the temple. This is the atishay of the temple. On 20 August 2016, one more underground room was discovered during temple renovation.

It was introduced by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. MRT is used to rank and evaluate the richness of certain communication media, such as phone calls, video conferencing, and email. For example, a phone call cannot reproduce visual social cues such as gestures which makes it a less rich communication media than video conferencing, which affords the transmission of gestures and body language. Based on contingency theory and information processing theory, MRT theorizes that richer, personal communication media are generally more effective for communicating equivocal issues in contrast with leaner, less rich media.  Background  Media richness theory was introduced in 1986 by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel. Leaning on information processing theory for its theoretical foundation, MRT was originally developed to describe and evaluate communication media within organizations. In presenting media richness theory, Daft and Lengel sought to help organizations cope with communication challenges, such as unclear or confusing messages, or conflicting interpretations of messages. Other communication scholars have tested the theory in order to improve it, and more recently Media Richness Theory has been retroactively adapted to include new media communication media, such as video telephony, online conferencing, and online coursework. Although media richness theory relates to media use, rather than media choice, empirical studies of the theory have often studied what medium a manager would choose to communicate over, and not the effects of media use. Since its introduction, media richness theory has been applied to contexts outside of organizational and business communication (See \\"Application\\" section).  Theory  Information richness is defined by Daft and Lengel as \\"the ability of information to change understanding within a time interval\\". Media richness theory states that all communication media vary in their ability to enable users to communicate and to change understanding. The degree of this ability is known as a medium's \\"richness.\\" MRT places all communication media on a continuous scale based on their ability to adequately communicate a complex message. Media that can efficiently overcome different frames of reference and clarify ambiguous issues are considered to be richer whereas communications media that require more time to convey understanding are deemed less rich. A primary driver in selecting a communication medium for a particular message is to reduce the equivocality, or possible misinterpretations, of a message. If a message is equivocal, it is unclear and thus more difficult for the receiver to decode. The more equivocal a message, the more cues and data needed to interpret it correctly. For example, a simple message intended to arrange a meeting time and place could be communicated in a short email, but a more detailed message about a person's work performance and expectations would be better communicated through face-to-face interaction. The theory includes a framework with axes going from low to high equivocality and low to high uncertainty. Low equivocality and low uncertainty represents a clear, well- defined situation; high equivocality and high uncertainty indicates ambiguous events that need clarification by managers. Daft and Lengel also stress that message clarity may be compromised when multiple departments are communicating with each other, as departments may be trained in different skill sets or have conflicting communication norms. =Determining media richness= In their 1988 article regarding media richness theory, Daft and Lengel state, \\"The more learning that can be pumped through a medium, the richer the medium.\\" Media richness is a function of characteristics including the following: * Ability to handle multiple information cues simultaneously * Ability to facilitate rapid feedback * Ability to establish a personal focus * Ability to utilize natural language = Selecting an appropriate medium = Media richness theory predicts that managers will choose the mode of communication based on aligning the equivocality of the message to the richness of the medium. In other words, communication channels will be selected based on how communicative they are. However, often other factors, such as the resources available to the communicator, come into play. Daft and Lengel's prediction assumes that managers are most concentrated on task efficiency (that is, achieving the communicative goal as efficiently as possible) and does not take into consideration other factors, such as relationship growth and maintenance. Subsequent researchers have pointed out that attitudes towards a medium may not accurately predict a person's likelihood of using that medium over others, as media usage is not always voluntary. If an organization's norms and resources support one medium, it may be difficult for a manager to choose another form to communicate his or her message. Social presence refers to the degree to which a medium permits communicators to experience others as being psychologically present or the degree to which a medium is perceived to convey the actual presence of the communicating participants. Tasks that involve interpersonal skills, such as resolving disagreements or negotiation, demand high social presence, whereas tasks such as exchanging routine information require less social presence. Therefore, face-to-face media like group meetings are more appropriate for performing tasks that require high social presence; media such as email and written letters are more appropriate for tasks that require low social presence. Another model that is related to media richness theory as an alternative, particularly in selecting an appropriate medium, is the social influence model. How we perceive media, in this case to decide where a medium falls on the richness scale, depends on \\"perceptions of media characteristics that are socially created,\\" reflecting social forces and social norms at play in the current environment and the context that determines the needed use. Each organization is different in the goal that is trying to be reached and the missions that are trying to be completed. Thus, with different organizational cultures and environments, the way each organization perceives a medium is different and as a result, the way each organization uses media and deems media as more or less rich will vary. Communicators also consider how personal a message is when determining the appropriate media for communication. In general, richer media are more personal as they include nonverbal and verbal cues, body language, inflection, and gestures that signal a person's reaction to a message. Rich media can promote a closer relationship between a manager and subordinate. The sentiment of the message may also have an influence on the medium chosen. Managers may want to communicate negative messages in person or via a richer media, even if the equivocality of the message is not high, in order to facilitate better relationships with subordinates. On the other hand, sending a negative message over a leaner medium would weaken the immediate blame on the message sender and prevent them from observing the reaction of the receiver. As current business models change, allowing more employees to work outside the office, organizations must rethink the reliance on face-to-face communication. Furthermore, the fear of more lean channels must be rid of. In this current context, managers must decided through trial and errors which medium is best used for various situations, namely an employee that works from the office vs. an employee that works outside the office. Business is being conducted on a global scale. In order to save money and cut back on travel time, organizations must adopt new media in order to stay up-to-date with business functions in the modern times. = Concurrency = In April 1993, Valacich et al. suggested that in light of new media, concurrency be included as an additional characteristic to determine a medium's richness. They define environmental concurrency to represent \\"the communication capacity of the environment to support distinct communication episodes, without detracting from any other episodes that may be occurring simultaneously between the same or different individuals.\\" Furthermore, they explain that while this idea of concurrency could be applied to the media described in Daft and Lengel's original theories, new media provide a greater opportunity for concurrency than ever before.  Applications  Explanatory diagram = Industries =  Organizational and business communications  Media richness theory was originally conceived in an organizational communication setting to better understand interaction within companies. MRT is used to determine the \\"best\\" medium for an individual or organization to communicate a message. For example, organizations may find that important decisions need to be discussed in face-to-face interactions; using email would not be an adequate channel. From an organizational perspective, high level personnel may require verbal media to help solve many of their problems. Entry-level positions with clear, unambiguous tasks may be fulfilled with written media forms. From an individual perspective, though, people prefer oral communication because the abundant communicative cues afford more accurate and efficient interpretation of the message. An information-processing perspective of organizations also highlights the important role of communication. This perspective suggests that organizations gather information from their environment, process this information, and then act on it. As environmental complexity, turbulence, and information load increase, organizational communication increases. The organization's effectiveness in processing information becomes paramount when the business environment is complex and wrought with rapid change. Today, companies use technologies such as video conferencing, which enable participants to see each other even when in separate locations. This technology affords organizations the opportunity to have richer communication than via traditional conference calls which only provide audio cues to the participants involved. Media sensitivity and job performance Daft and Lengel also assert that not all executives or managers in organizations demonstrate the same skill in making effective media choices for communications. High performing executives or managers tend to be more \\"sensitive\\" to richness requirements in media selection than low performing managers. In other words, competent executives select rich media for non- routine messages and lean media for routine messages. From the consensus and satisfaction perspectives, groups with a communication medium which is too lean for their task seem to experience more difficulties than groups with a communication medium which is too rich for their task. Additionally, face-to- face groups achieved higher consensus change, higher decision satisfaction and higher decision scheme satisfaction than dispersed groups. Job seeking and recruitment In a job recruitment context, face-to-face interactions with company representatives, such as at career fairs, should be perceived by applicants as rich media. Career fairs allow instant feedback in the form of questions and answers and permit multiple cues including verbal messages and body gestures and can be tailored to each job seeker's interests and questions. In comparison, static messages like reading information on a company's website or browsing an electronic bulletin board can be defined as leaner media since they are not customized to the individual needs of job seekers; they are asynchronous in their feedback and, since they are primarily text-based, there are no opportunities for verbal inflections or body gestures. This interaction between job seekers and potential employers affects how candidates process information about the organization. The interactions a candidate has with a potential employer via lean and rich media shape a job seeker's beliefs. Some employers have started using more vivid tools to answer questions about job recruitment such as videos, animations and virtual agents. Counterintuitively, elements which are more interactive like the US Army's virtual agent, Sgt. Starr, have been shown to hinder information transfer for ambiguous or complex messages such as a company's value or mission.  Virtual teams and teleworking  Many organizations are distributed globally with employees on a single team located in many different time zones. In order to facilitate productive cooperation and team dynamics, organizations benefit from considering the technology tools that are provided for coworking and communication. Workman, Kahnweiler, and Bommer (2003) found that an ideal teleworking design would feature a variety of types of media, ranging from lean to rich, in which workers can choose the media that is most suitable for their working style and the task at hand. Further, different jobs may require different types of media. Jobs that are more concrete and structured like planning, administration or operations may be sustainable with lean media options while software design and development which inherently has much more uncertainty and negotiation is best supported by richer media channels. A 2009 study exploring the dynamics of virtual teams showed that the use of richer media in virtual work environments decreased perceived social loafing, or the feeling that a group member's individual contributions are not noticed or valued.  Corporate social responsibility  The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which originally gained prominence in the 1960s, describes a company's self-regulation in the compliance of the ethical and moral standards. Public companies often describe their CSR efforts as an aspect of marketing campaigns in order to appeal to customers. Sat and Selemat (2014) found that customers were more affected by such messages when they were communicated through rich channels instead of lean ones. = Media = While media richness theory's application to new media has been contested (see \\"Criticism\\"), it is still used heuristically as a basis for studies examining new media.  Websites and hypertext  Websites can vary in their richness. In a study examining representations of the former Yugoslavia on the World Wide Web, Jackson and Purcell proposed that hypertext plays a role in determining the richness of individual websites. They developed a framework of criteria in which the use of hypertext on a website can be evaluated in terms of media richness characteristics as set forth by Daft and Lengel in their original theoretical literature. Furthermore, in their 2004 article, Simon and Peppas examined product websites' richness in terms of multimedia use. They classified \\"rich media sites\\" as those that included text, pictures, sounds and video clips, while the \\"lean media sites\\" contained only text. In their study, they created four sites (two rich and two lean) to describe two products (one simple, one complex). They found that most users, regardless of the complexity of the product, preferred the websites that provided richer media. Rich media on websites also has the potential to stimulate action in the physical world. Lu, Kim, Dou and Kumar (2014) demonstrated that websites with 3D views of a fitness center were more successful in creating a student's intention to visit the gym than a website with static 2D images.  Instant messaging and texting  Media richness theory implies that a sender should select a medium of appropriate richness to communicate the desired message or fulfill a specific task. Senders that use less-rich communication media must consider the limitations of that medium in the dimensions of feedback, multiple cues, message tailoring, and emotions. Take for example the relative difficulty of determining whether a modern text message is serious or sarcastic in tone. The leanness of the text prevents the transmission of tone and facial expression which would otherwise be useful in detecting the sarcasm. However, results from a study conducted by Anandarajan et al. on Generation Y's use of instant messaging conclude that \\"the more users recognize IM as a rich communication medium, the more likely they believe this medium is useful for socialization.\\" Though Generation Y users consider texting to be a rich medium, there is additional evidence that shows that easily accessible and non-intrusive media (i.e., texting, Twitter) were more likely to be used for sharing positive than negative events, and intrusive and rich media (i.e., phone calling) were more likely to be used for sharing negative than positive events. Additionally, in order to better understand teenagers' use of MSN (later called Microsoft Messenger service), Sheer examined the effect of both media richness and communication control. Among other findings, Sheer's study demonstrated that \\"rich features, such as webcam and MSN Spaces seemingly facilitated the increase of acquaintances, new friends, opposite-sex friends, and, thus, the total number of friends.\\"  E-mail  In recent years, as the general population has become more e-mail savvy, the lines have blurred somewhat between face-to-face and e-mail communication. E-mail is now thought of as a verbal tool, with its capacity to enable immediate feedback, leverage natural language, and embed emotion via acronyms and emoticons. However, there is a downside of e-mail: volume overload. Emails often have large unnecessary quantities of information which is non-job essential and/or spam. Filtering through this junk does require additional time. The time required to manage email can cause an information overload. With excess email, people may feel that they will miss information due to the sheer volume on content they receive. Some individuals may find this volume to be a barrier to swift responses to emails. Email do have the capacity to transmit more informational content than other channels such as voicemail. Perception of email as a rich platform varies among users though. This perception contributes to how the individual will use the channel. For some, the choice of content will differ. They may include images or videos if they recognize email as a rich channel whereas others may only leverage text. This perception also affects choice of linguistic features. Those that see email as similar to an oral channel will type differently than those who see email as a written channel.  Video conferencing  Video conference software has been used not only for virtual teams in large companies, but also for classrooms and casual conversations. Software or Video Conferencing Systems (VCS) such as Skype and Google Hangouts allow for more visual cues than just audio conversations. Research suggests that VCS is somewhere between the telephone and face-to-face meetings in terms of media richness. Even though video conferencing does not have the same richness as face-to-face conversations, a study regarding video conferencing has said that richer content-presentation types were positively correlated with higher concentration levels but showed mixed results when correlated with perceived usefulness. = Other applications =  Relational communication  Kashian and Walther (2018) find that asynchronous communication is a better medium for reducing conflict between people who have generally positive opinions/attributions of their partners than does the face-to-face medium. The authors credit relational intimacy and attending positive attributions made by the partners as a potential reason for overcoming asynchronous communication's alleged shortcomings as espoused by the media synchronicity theory, which ‚Äú[contends] that synchronous media are best for convergent conflict communication‚Äù (2018, p. 7, citing Dennis et al., 2008). The authors conclude, ‚Äúasynchronous CMC is a beneficial medium for online conflict among satisfied couples‚Äù (2018, p. 19). In another study, Koutamanis et al. (2013) suggest that adolescents‚Äô engagement through instant messaging may actually serve to improve their respective abilities to enter into in-person relationships in the real world. The authors focus on textual communication via electronic means. Although the written word is generally considered to be one of the leanest forms of communication regardless of how it is delivered according to the media richness theory, this study illustrates how texting may enhance adolescents‚Äô ability to later succeed with face-to-face interactions that come after a certain amount of interaction through textual correspondence. In a 2016 article, Lisiecka et al. point out that, although it has been generally accepted that ‚Äúmedia other than face-to-face are considered an obstacle rather than an equally effective means of information transfer‚Äù (2016, p. 13), their results suggest that computer-mediated communication ‚Äúhas become similarly natural and intuitive as face-to-face contacts‚Äù (2016, p. 13). Tong and Walther (2015) argue that unlike predictions attributed to early computer- mediated communication theories like the media richness (Daft & Lengel, 1986) and media naturalness (Kock, 2004) theories, nonverbal communication may not be ‚Äúessential to the behavioral transfer and perceptual interpretation of expectancies‚Äù (2015, p. 204). And further suggest that face-to-face communication may negatively skew people's interactions if the participants‚Äô first impressions are influenced by biases that are responsive to visual cues.  Deception  Deception, in the context of communication theory, occurs when the sender knowingly conveys a false message to the receiver. According to Buller and Burgoon, \\"deception occurs when communicators control the information contained in their messages to convey a meaning that departs from the truth as they know it.\\" This idea is central to the Interpersonal deception theory. Additional research has analyzed the relationship between media richness and the communication of deceptive messages. Richer media, especially those that transmit non-verbal cues such tone of voice, facial expression or gestures, show lesser incidences of deceptive messages than lean media. By leveraging a richer media, interlocutors develop stronger affective bonds which mitigates the likelihood that one speaker will try to deceive another. When honesty is not considered the best policy, learner media, such as e-mail, allows for a stronger possibility of deception.  Distance education and e-books  In evaluating students' satisfaction with distance courses, Sheppherd and Martz concluded that a course's use of media rich technology affected how students evaluated the quality of the course. Courses that utilized tools such as \\"discussion forums, document sharing areas, and web casting\\" were viewed more favorably. Lai and Chang in 2011 used media richness as a variable in their study examining user attitudes towards e-books, stating that the potential for rich media content like embedded hyperlinks and other multimedia additions, offered users a different reading experience than a printed book. Further research by Lan and Sie (2010), that within the category of text based communication channels, there are significant differences that should shape an instructor's choice of technology. They studied the use of SMS, email and RSS and found that SMS is suitable for fast delivery, email affords greater content richness and RSS is the ideal format for content presentation on front-end mobile devices. E-books and e-learning are becoming recurrent tools in the academic landscape. One of the key characteristics of e-learning is its capability to integrate different media, such as text, picture, audio, animation and video to create multimedia instructional material. Media selection in e-learning can be a critical issue because of the increased costs of developing non-textual e-learning materials. Learners can benefit from the use of richer media in courses that contain equivocal and complex content; however, learners achieve no significant benefit in either learner score or learner satisfaction from the use of richer media in courses containing low equivocal (numeric) content.  Nursing  The transition from analog to digital record keeping in medical care has been at the forefront of medical innovation. Castro, Favela, and Gracia-Pena studied the effects of different media (face to face, telephone and videoconferencing) on nursing consultations in emergency calls. They found that while there were no efficacy differences between media, richer media did facilitate faster consultations and resolutions. Videoconferencing may result in less eye contact than if the nurse was face to face with the patient.  Finding physicians and healthcare providers  Despite interpersonal communication being a key ingredient in medical encounters, and physician communication being one of the most important qualities patients indicate in their selection of a new doctor, healthcare organizations do not do a very good job helping their prospective patients understand how a new doctor would communicate with them in future encounters through their online biographies - most only providing \\"lean\\" biographies of text, and very few providing \\"richer\\" video introductions. Video introductions provide the opportunity to help patients actually see how a physician might interact within a consultation. Perrault and Silk tested what effects richer video introductions of doctors might have on patients when they are in this decision-making phase. They uncovered that when participants were exposed to a richer video introduction of the physician that uncertainty was reduced to a greater extent than when they were only exposed a lean, text-based biography. Participants were also more likely to choose to want to visit the doctor who provided the richer video introduction over the leaner text biography.  Civic engagement  Media used online also has been successfully proven to stimulate civic engagement. Leveraging the Internet to facilitate public deliberation has been proven to be a successful and cost-effective way to engage large volumes of citizens. Studies have shown that mixed modality media (both rich and lean) can be useful in citizen education and engagement. Through the creation of new social networks and various online platforms, media allows for many more opportunities of \\"greater visibility and community building potential of cultural citizenship's previous 'ephemeral' practices.\\"Burgess, Jean and Foth, Marcus and Klaebe, Helen (2006) Everyday Creativity as Civic Engagement: A Cultural Citizenship View of New Media. In Proceedings Communications Policy & Research Forum, Sydney. The explosion of creativity on the internet can be linked to formal institutions such as government and education in order to allow for a broader participation base, leading to stronger engagement of citizens and gaining access to a wider range of insight and knowledge.  Criticism  =Scope of the theory= Media richness theory has been criticized by what many researchers saw as its deterministic nature. Markus argues that social pressures can influence media use much more strongly than richness, and in ways that are inconsistent with MRT's key tenets. It has also been noted that media richness theory should not assume that the feelings towards using a richer media in a situation are completely opposite to using a leaner media. In fact, media choice is complex and in general even if a rich media is considered to be the \\"best\\" to communicate a message, a leaner media may still be able to communicate the message. In addition, for some tasks, the type of media used will make no difference to the accuracy of the communicated message. In selecting a medium for message transmission, an individual will also consider his or her comfort with the possible options. If an individual is uncomfortable or unfamiliar with using an email system to distribute a message, and view learning to send an email as more time-consuming and inefficient than simply having a group meeting, he or she may choose a richer medium instead of a more efficient medium. This behavior outcome, through irrational, is certainly a reflection upon the previously established experience.King, Ruth C.. Media Appropriateness: Effects of Experience on Communication Media Choice, p. 877-910 =Cultural and social limitations= Ngwenyama and Lee show that cultural and social background influence media choice by individuals in ways that are incompatible with predictions based on media richness theory; their paper received the Paper of the Year Award in the journal MIS Quarterly. Ngwenyama and Lee are not alone in their critiques regarding the limitations of media richness theory, particularly in regards to cultural and individual characteristics. Research by Ook Lee demonstrated that in a Confucian virtual work environment where showing respect is essential, a communication channel's ability to convey cultural protocol is more important than the richness of the channel. In 2009, Gerritsen's study concluded that in business contexts, culture does play a role in determining the receiver's preference of medium, perhaps in terms of the specific culture's threshold for uncertainty avoidance. Additionally, Dennis, Kinney, and Hung found that in terms of the actual performance of equivocal tasks, the richness of a medium has the most notable effect on teams composed entirely of females. On the other hand, \\"matching richness to task equivocality did not improve decision quality, time, consensus, or communication satisfaction for all-male or mixed-gender teams.\\" Individually speaking, Barkhi demonstrated that communication mode and cognitive style can play a role in media preference and selection, suggesting that even in situations with identical messages and intentions, the \\"best\\" media selection can vary from person to person. =Application to new media= Additionally, because media richness theory was developed before widespread use of the internet, which also introduced media like email, chat rooms, instant messaging, smartphone, and more, some have questioned its ability to accurately predict what new media users may choose. Several studies have been conducted that examine media choice when given options considered to be \\"new media\\", such as voice mail and email. Blau, Weiser, and Eshet-Alkalai study the differences and similarities of perceived and actual outcomes for students who take the same class either online or in traditional classroom settings. The authors conclude that face-to-face classroom settings are not superior to online classrooms. Further, they also suggest that a ‚Äúhigh level of medium naturalness might hinder the understanding of a very complicated type of knowledge‚Äù, which is the opposite of what the media richness theory predicts. El-Shinnaway and Markus hypothesized that, based on media richness theory, individuals would choose to communicate messages over the more rich medium of voice mail than via email, but found that even when sending more equivocal messages, the leaner medium of email was used. Also, it has been indicated that given the expanded capabilities of new media, media richness theory's unidimensional approach to categorizing different communication media in no longer sufficient to capture all the dimensions in which media types can vary. Related theories = Media naturalness = Several new theories have been developed based on Daft and Lengel's original framework. Kock (2004) argues that human non-lexical communication methods and apparatus, such as facial expressions, gestures, and body language, have evolved for millions of years, and as such, must be important to the naturalness of communication between people. Media Naturalness Theory hypothesizes that because face-to-face communication is the most \\"natural\\" method of communication, we should want our other communication methods to resemble face-to-face communication as closely as possible. While media richness theory places media on a scale that range from low to high in richness and places face-to-face communication at the top of the scale, Media Naturalness Theory thinks of face-to-face communication as the middle in a scale, and states that the further away one gets from face-to-face (either more or less rich), the more cognitive processing is required to comprehend a message. = Media compensation = The 2011 media compensation theory by Hantula, Kock, D'Arcy, and DeRosa refines Kock's media naturalness theory. The authors explain that the media compensation theory has been developed to specifically address two paradoxes: # Virtual communication, work, collaboration, and teams are largely successful (sometimes even more so than face-to-face equivalents) which conflicts with Kock's media naturalness theory; and, # \\"The human species evolved in small groups using communications modalities in constrained areas, yet use electronic communication media to allow large groups to work together effectively across time and space‚Äù (Hantula et al., 2011, p. 358). The authors grapple with how humans ‚Äúwho have not changed much in many millennia‚Äù (Hantula et al., 2011, p. 358) are able to successfully embrace and employ lean media, such as texting, considering their assumption that human evolution has progressed down a path toward, and adeptness for, face-to-face communication, and conclude that elements of the media naturalness theory can coexist with Carlson and Zmud's channel expansion theory. = Media synchronicity = To help explain media richness and its application to new media, media synchronicity theory was proposed. Synchronicity describes the ability of a medium to create the sense that all participants are concurrently engaged in the communication event. Media with high degrees of synchronicity, such as face-to-face meetings, offer participants the opportunity to communicate in real time, immediately observe the reactions and responses of others, and easily determine whether co-participants are fully engaged in the conversation. Media synchronicity theory also states that each medium has a set of abilities and that every communication interaction is composed of two processes: conveyance and convergence. These abilities include: transmission velocity, parallelism, symbol sets, rehearsability, and reaccessability. Media richness is also related to adaptive structuration theory and social information processing theory, which explain the context around a communication that might influence media choice. = Channel expansion = Channel expansion theory was proposed by Carlson and Zmud (1999) to explain the inconsistencies found in several empirical studies. In these studies, the results showed that managers would employ \\"leaner\\" media for tasks of high equivocality. Channel expansion theory suggested that individual's media choice has a lot to do with individual's experience with the medium itself, with the communicator and also with the topic. Thus it is possible that an individual's experience with using a certain lean medium, will prompt that individual to use it for equivocal tasks. For example, a study by Kahai, Carroll, and Jestice (2007) showed that participants' familiarity with instant messaging led them to perceive the medium as richer than the virtual world known as Second Life. Participants' lack of experience with the objectively richer virtual world may have affected their perception when compared to the more familiar medium of instant messaging. However, the theory does not suggest that knowledge-building experiences will necessarily equalize differences in richness, whether objective or perceptually-based, across different media. Put in another way, knowledge-building experiences may be positively related to perceptions of the richness of email, but this does not necessarily mean that email will be viewed as richer than another medium, such as face-to-face interaction  See also  *Communication theory *Emotions in virtual communication *Hyperpersonal model *Multicommunicating *Social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) *Telecommuting *Theories of technology  References   Further reading  *Daft, R.L. & Lengel, R.H.

An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative second-rower, he is a rugby league media identity. Geyer's club career was played primarily with Penrith, with whom he won a premiership in 1991, as well as the Balmain Tigers and the Western Reds. He is also the brother of fellow former professional rugby league footballer Matt Geyer. Geyer was part of the Triple M on-air team for the Sydney breakfast show called The Grill Team from 2009 to 2017 before moving to an evening slot‚ÄîThe Rush Hour‚Äîon the same station. Playing career In 1987, Geyer established a regular first-grade place with the Penrith Panthers and was selected for the City Seconds team after only a handful of top grade appearances. He also played in Penrith's 1987 Reserve Grade Grand Final winning team that defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 11-0 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Geyer was first selected in the second row for New South Wales in game 3 of the 1989 State of Origin series, at Lang Park in Brisbane. His 1990 season was largely lost to a succession of injuries that restricted him to just 12 games, though he did play in Penrith's maiden Grand Final appearance (an 18-14 loss to the Canberra Raiders) and from there was selected, along with Panthers teammates Greg Alexander, John Cartwright and Brad Fittler, for the 1990 Kangaroo tour. Geyer played in 11 games on the Kangaroo Tour, scoring 4 tries and earning his first Australian test jumper when he was selected on the bench for the first test against France at the Parc de Sports in Avignon. Geyer's form for the Panthers in 1991 again earned him selection for NSW during the State of Origin series. Geyer received a five-match suspension for an incident in the second game at a wet Sydney Football Stadium, which was preceded by a half-time confrontation with Queensland captain Wally Lewis in which referee David Manson and NSW captain Ben Elias had to stand between the two who twice almost came to blows. He was cited for an elbow to the head of Queensland fullback Paul Hauff, which sparked an all-in brawl. His suspension saw him unavailable for selection in the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand in Melbourne, though after the Australians lost the test 24-8 a number of changes were made and Geyer's form was rewarded with selection in the second test in Sydney and the third in Brisbane. The Aussies went on to win the final two tests to wrap up the series 2-1.1991 Trans-Tasman Test series at Rugby League Project In August 1991, he was thought to be out for the rest of the season after injuring his ankle ligaments in a training session, only to return for the major semifinal. However, despite his problems during the season, Geyer helped the minor premiers into the Grand Final where they gained revenge on Canberra with a 19-12 win that saw the Panthers win their first premiership since entering the competition in 1967. Geyer had a hand in all three of the Panthers tries on the day and was judged to be their best player, though his sin-binning for dissent by referee Bill Harrigan during the second half was thought to have cost him the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match.1991 NSWRL Grand Final at Rugby League Project He spent the 1993 season with the Balmain Tigers. After leaving Penrith, the coach of Balmain at the time Alan Jones handed Geyer a lifeline. Speaking to the media in 2018 Geyer spoke of his time at Balmain saying \\"It was shit to be honest, I didn't like it one bit,I didn't like travelling on the M4, which at the time only had two lanes all the way to Leichhardt Oval in peak hour then driving home in peak hour, take all that aside from it, the people involved with the Tigers at the time I loved. Alan Jones was the only coach in Sydney who would throw me a lifeline after I left Penrith in controversial circumstances\\". In 1994, Geyer spent a season playing with the Umina Beach Bunnies who play in the Central Coast Division Rugby League competition after leaving Balmain. Geyer played for the Western Reds from 1995 until 1997, before returning to the Panthers in 1998.https://www.triplem.com.au/sport/nrl/news/it-was-shit-i-didnt-like-it- one-bit-mg-on-a-tough-time-in-his-career?station=sydney In 2000, Mark Geyer was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He retired at the end of the 2000 season. Post-playing career Since his retirement, Geyer has written extensively about rugby league for various newspapers and sporting magazines. In May 2010, he spoke out about his mid career drug and alcohol battle that lasted from 1992‚Äì1995, \\"My beer and speed binge shame\\", The Daily Telegraph and how it almost ended his career. He said a large part of the drug usage was to simply trying to numb the pain of losing his best mate, former Penrith player Ben Alexander, who was killed in a car accident in 1992. Geyer was a regular panellist on rugby league talk show The Sunday Roast where he referred himself as 'the man of the people'. He was on Triple M in Sydney, as a breakfast presenter on The Grill Team Monday-to-Friday 6-9am with Matthew Johns and Gus Worland from August 2009 to 2017. He also appears on Triple M on Saturday mornings, presenting the 'Dead Set Legends' segment alongside Ray Warren. In 2012, it was announced that Geyer joined Fox Sports (Australia) as part of their Rugby League coverage. He is a Panelist on NRL on FOX Geyer is actively involved in a number of charities, such as the Fight For Life charity boxing event,BSA Decision 2003-165,166 he is the ambassador for the Save Our Sons charity. In response to the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods, Geyer organised the 2011 Legends of Origin charity match which raised $455,345 for the recovery effort. On Australia Day 2013, Mark was announced in the Honours List. He received an Order Of Australia medal for \\"service to the sport of Rugby League football, and to the community through a range of charitable organisations.\\" In November 2017, Geyer announced that he would be leaving The Grill Team. He heads The Rush Hour on the same network. In August 2019, Geyer claimed on Triple M's the Rush Hour that within 10 years at least one Sydney team in the NRL would no longer exist. Geyer went on to say ‚ÄúThey will be extinct, they will die a slow death. We have too many teams in Sydney, it‚Äôs as simple as that\\". Geyer then suggested that the NRL introduce a controversial KPI target system where Sydney clubs were measured on sponsorship dollars, average crowd figures, on-field success and their dedication to junior and grassroots rugby league. Geyer went on to explain about the KPI system saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how they would do it, there‚Äôs brainier guys than me at the moment, people who get paid to do this, but after five years, the club with the lowest points, guess what, they move to the Central Coast\\". Personal life Geyer's younger brother Matt Geyer also played rugby league, initially with Mark at the Western Reds in 1997, before playing with the Melbourne Storm between 1998 and 2008. Geyer is married to the sister of former fellow Penrith players Greg Alexander and the late Ben Alexander.

Akihito Morimoto and Kazuto Maekawa first formed an 80s metal cover band in high school called Caducious.\\"Westin, C\\" \\"Proper Magazine\\" Morimoto and Maekawa moved to Tokyo and played as guitarist and bassist in a five-piece pop rock band. Morimoto later said that one of the main reasons for this band's demise was that they acted on everything that they were told, and as a result soon became directionless. This helped form the attitude of Electric Eel Shock ‚Äì that musicians should listen to the views of others, but should learn from their own mistakes. After the demise of the pop rock band, Morimoto and Maekawa stayed in Tokyo. Morimoto followed his passion of fishing and became a competitive angler (he still writes for Japan's largest fishing magazine, Basser Magazine) and Maekawa joined The Apollos (a well-known Japanese funk band) as session bassist. Maekawa's low-slung bass and unkempt appearance was at odds with The Apollos' suited and polished image, and meant that his time in this role was short-lived. However, Maekawa left a lasting impression on their drummer, Tomoharu Ito (known as Gian, due to his similar appearance to a well-known Japanese comedian of that name). Gian, who had a day job making artificial teeth, was soon introduced to Morimoto, and the three started practicing together shortly afterwards. =Early years= The first incarnation of Electric Eel Shock was different from their current attributes. The band's first public performances were as an 11-piece group with keyboards, female vocals and French horns. It was not until the logistics of getting all of its members together on the same day to practice became unworkable that the band stripped down to a three-piece. Gian took up playing with four drumsticks,\\"Despres, S\\" \\"Gig Review\\" and also gained a reputation for playing almost naked.\\"Tanzer, J\\" \\"Returning Japanese\\"\\"TCB: SXSW News\\" \\"The Austin Chronicle\\" Gian has been arrested once, in Hong Kong and fined HK$100, for playing this way. Electric Eel Shock decided against making demos and sending them to record companies. Instead, they quickly set up the Micro Music record label with their friends, and released their first full-length album, Maybe... I Think We Can Beat Nirvana. They followed this with Live Punctured. In 1999, Electric Eel Shock recorded Slayers Bay Blues on an eight-track recorder, and made enough copies to begin their first concerts abroad. They had lined up a handful of dates in and around New York, including CBGB, with their friends Peelander-Z who had relocated there some time earlier. The gigs were a big success, and the handful of dates that were planned turned into an East Coast tour. =Go America= Shortly after returning to Japan, EES sold their property and left their homes. They returned to the US and toured almost constantly for the next two years. All the while, the band survived on the sale of CDs, t-shirts, and help from friends. They then recorded the EP Go America. =Go Europe= In early 2003 the band received an email invitation from journalist Bob Slayer to perform in London. On January 16, 2003, Electric Eel Shock landed in London for five hastily-arranged gigs. The five shows rapidly become twelve gigs in ten days. The band used the London Underground as their only form of transport. After this, they returned to the US with Bob Slayer as their new manager. The band spent the rest of 2003 between the US and Europe. Highlights included playing at both the SXSW and CMJ festivals in America, playing at Roskilde Festival in Denmark, headlining the Rockit Hong Kong Music Festival,Rockit Hong Kong Music Festival and supporting the Canadian band Danko Jones on a 40-date European tour. At the start of 2004 Electric Eel Shock went into the studio for the last of the Go sessions. Although these were still produced on a relatively low budget, and paid for by the band, this was the first time that they had used a studio and sound engineer as opposed to a practice room, kitchen or cupboard. The results, Go Europe! / Go USA!, were licensed around the world and the band went on a promotional tour that took in 25 countries and 27 European festivals. =Beat Me= The band's European base camp for much of their touring in 2004 was the Suicide Motel in Utrecht,\\"CD Liner notes for Roadrunner (Japan) release of Beat Me\\" Netherlands, which Bob Slayer set up with Frank Suicide the guitarist of the Dutch band Wasted. Whilst spending time in the Netherlands they developed their friendship with Grammy-nominated producer Attie Bauw (who had worked with Judas Priest and the Scorpions) that they had met in Amsterdam during the Danko Jones tour. Electric Eel Shock were soon making plans with Attie Bauw for a new album. This would represent a move away from their garage rock roots. The aim was to catch all the energy and character of an Electric Eel Shock performance with a production that would sit alongside the early Black Sabbath albums that had inspired their creation. Assisting Attie in the studio was the band's live engineer, Tim Bray, who had become a fixture on tour with the band. The band finished recording Beat Me at the end of December 2004, and returned to Japan for the first time in a long time, to do a few gigs. Throughout 2005 EES shows have become larger; touring in the US and Europe with the Bloodhound Gang, headlining festivals, and playing with the West Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra. Electric Eel Shock also made an appearance in the video clip for the Bloodhound Gang song \\"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\\". Their tours throughout Europe at the end of 2005 were completely sold out. In March 2006, Beat Me was released in Japan on legendary metal label Roadrunner Records. The band toured Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the US in 2006 and played festivals in Europe. =Transworld Ultra Rock= Electric Eel Shock released Transworld Ultra Rock on October 1, 2007.\\"Tolley, S\\" \\"Electric Eel Shock - Transworld Ultra Shock\\" The album was the first release on their own label Double Peace Records. The band toured throughout Europe in support of the new album, later appearing as a support act on The Presidents of the United States of America's These Are the Good Times People tour.\\"The editor\\" \\"rock-metal-music-reviews.com\\" The album was released by P-Vine records on November 16, 2007 in Japan. It has been Electric Eel Shock's most successful album to date in terms of both press and sales. =Sugoi Indeed= Electric Eel Shock joined Sellaband on 2 May 2008\\"EES Sellaband Artist page\\" to raise the funds to record their next album. On 25 June 2008 after 55 days the band successfully raised $50,000.\\"Sellaband Tribune Edition 88\\" The press release describes Sugoi Indeed as an album full of classic rock hand-crafted in Japan. Attie Bauw, (Judas Priest, Scorpions) who produced the last two EES albums, was at the controls again, only this time he engineered the basic tracks and Electric Eel Shock took the production reins on the album themselves. The album was licensed to several labels around the world and was released in October 2009. =Crowdfunding= Electric Eel Shock has always had strong support from their fans and became one of the first bands without previous significant record label success to fully embrace crowdfunding. In 2004 they raised ¬£10,000 from 100 fans (the Samurai 100) by offering them guestlist for life. Two years later they became the fastest band to raise the 50,000 budget through SellaBand. The album Sugoi Indeed, has been licensed to Universal Records in Japan and various independent labels around the world. EES and their UK based manager Bob Slayer became consultants on first SellaBand and later PledgeMusic. Having played an important role in establishing the viability and model for Crowd Funding in music they have now launched their own crowd funding site Fan-Bo.com. Launched in June 2012 Fan-Bo is a place where fans of Japanese pop culture can support independent bands, artists, writers and other creatives. Discography =Albums= *Maybe...

He was martyred in action in the Battle of Basantar in the Battlefield of Shakargarh during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 where his actions earned him his honour. Early life Arun Khetarpal was born in Pune, Maharashtra on 14 October 1950. His family belonged to Sargodha, Pakistan, and had migrated to India after partition as refugees. His father Lt Col (later Brigadier) M. L. Khetarpal was a Corps of Engineers officer serving in the Indian Army and his family traced a long history of military service. Attending The Lawrence School, Sanawar, he distinguished himself both as an able student and sportsman and was the school prefect.Arun Khetarpal on Indian army's site, indianarmy.nic.in Khetarpal joined the National Defence Academy in June 1967. He belonged to Foxtrot Squadron where he was the Squadron Cadet Captain of the 38th Course. His NDA No was 7498/F/38. He subsequently went on to join the Indian Military Academy. In June 1971, Khetarpal was commissioned into the 17 Poona Horse. 1971 War During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, the 17 Poona Horse was assigned to the command of the 47th Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army. Through the duration of the conflict, the 47th Brigade saw action in the Shakargarh sector in the Battle of Basantar. =Battle of Basantar= Among the tasks set for the 47th Brigade was to establish a bridgehead across the River Basantar. By 21:00 hours of 15 December, the brigade had captured its objectives. However, the place was extensively mined, which prevented the deployment of the tanks of the Poona Horse, and the engineers clearing the mines were halfway through their tasks when Indian troops at the bridge-head reported alarming enemy armour activity, asking for immediate armour support. It was at this critical juncture that the 17 Poona Horse decided to push through the mine-field. The regiment was able to link-up with the infantry at the bridge-head by first light the next day.http://pages.rediff.com/battle-of-basantar/536748 =Bridge-head= At 08:00 hours on 16 December, Pakistani armour launched the first of their counter-attacks under the cover of a smokescreen at the pivot of the 17th Poona Horse at Jarpal. At 08:00 hours, the Pakistani 13th Lancers, equipped with the then state-of-the-art US-made 50 ton Patton tanks, launched the first of their counter-attacks under the cover of a smokescreen at 'B' Squadron, The Poona Horse, at Jarpal. Its squadron commander urgently called for reinforcements. Arun Khetarpal, who was in 'A' squadron and was stationed close by with his Centurion tank troop, responded with alacrity, as did the rest of his regiment. The first counter-attack was decimated by accurate gunnery, coolness by Indian tank troop and individual tank commanders from the CO, Lt Col Hanut Singh down to its troop leader, Arun Khetarpal. The 13th Lancers desperately launched two more squadron-level counter-attacks and managed to achieve a breakthrough. Khetarpal rushed to meet the Pakistani armour and launched right into the Pakistani attack. With his troop, he was able to run over the enemy advance with his tanks. However, the commander of the second tank was killed in this attack. Alone in charge, Khetarpal continued his attack on the enemy strongholds. The enemy fought very bravely and did not retreat even after taking losses. Disappointed by his failure so far, he desperately attacked the incoming Pakistani troops and tanks, knocking out a Pakistani tank in the process. However Pakistani forces regrouped and counter-attacked. In the ensuing tank battle, Lt. Arun Khetarpal with his 2 remaining tanks fought off and destroyed 10 tanks before he was killed in action. =Death= The skirmish however took its toll on the lieutenant as he was hit by enemy fire, but instead of abandoning the tank he fought on destroying one final tank before he was finally overwhelmed. However, his actions had denied a vital breakthrough for Pakistani forces and instead put the Indians in a stronger position in the Shakargarh bulge. His final words over the radio to a superior officer who had ordered him to abandon his burning tank were, Then he set about destroying the remaining enemy tanks. The last enemy tank, which he shot, was barely 100 metres from his position. At this stage, his tank received a second hit and he was seriously injured. The officer met his death trying to deny the Pakistani Army its desired breakthrough. Khetarpal's body and his tank, named \\"Famagusta\\", were later captured by Pakistan and eventually returned to the Indian military. This tank is on display back in India now. For his conspicuous bravery and extreme gallantry in the face of fierce and unrelenting attacks and assaults by the enemy (the Pakistani military), Khetarpal was honoured with India's most- prestigious and highest-standard military medal for courage and gallantry, the Param Vir Chakra, posthumously. Arun Khetarpal's body was cremated on 17 December near the Samba district and his ashes were sent to his family, who were unaware of his death until 26 December. The crew of the Famagusta was Sowar Prayag Singh (the driver), Sowar Nand Singh (the radio operator), Sowar Nathu Singh (the gunner) and 2nd/Lt. Arun Khetarpal, the tank's commander. Nand Singh was first casualty (killed in action; KIA) when the tank was fatally hit in the final encounter with Pakistani Army Major Nasser's Patton tank. Arun was the second one to be killed after he sustained severe injuries when his tank was knocked out and eventually succumbed to his wounds. Both Prayag Singh and Nathu Singh were also badly wounded but survived and were captured by Pakistani troops who seized the Famagusta. Both men were later given medical treatment by their Pakistani captors and survived to the end of the war when they were repatriated and retired from the Indian Army as honorary captains. Param Vir Chakra Citation The Param Vir Chakra citation on the Official Indian Army Website reads as follows: Tribute & Facts Khetrapal is an iconic figure in the ethos of the Indian Army with prominent constructions being named after him. The parade ground at NDA is named Khetarpal Ground while the auditorium and one of the main gates bear his name at the IMA. Arun Khetarpal's Centurion was called Famagusta Jx 202. It was restored after the war and is presently preserved in the Armoured Corps Centre and School in Ahmednagar. Legacy National War Memorial, New Delhi . The Commander of the Pakistan tank battalion is said to have met the Indian battalion commander after the battle and made enquiries about 2nd Lieutenant Khetarpal's tank since he was very impressed with the gallantry of this particular tank's commander. In 2001, Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal ‚Äì then 81 years old ‚Äì felt a strong desire to visit his birthplace at Sargodha, now in Pakistan. At Lahore airport, Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal was met by Brigadier Khawja Mohammad Naser, who took it upon himself to be Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal host and guide. Brigadier Naser really went out of way to ensure that Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal had a satisfying and nostalgic visit to his old house in Sargodha. Upon his return to Lahore he was once again the guest of Brigadier Naser for three days. Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal was overwhelmed by the extreme kindness, deference, courtesy and respect bestowed upon him by Brigadier Naser and by all the members of his family and his many servants. However Brigadier Khetarpal felt that something was amiss but could not make out what it was. Was it the long silences that punctuated their animated conversation or was it the look of compassion in the eyes of the women in the family? He could not make out but was sure he was being treated as someone very special. Finally, on the last night before Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal's departure, Brigadier Naser said Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal was silent as he did not know how to react. To be enjoying the hospitality of the person who had killed his son was a confusing feeling. However being a soldier himself he genuinely admired the chivalry of an officer whose complete squadron was decimated by his son. Both the Brigadiers retired for the night deep in thought. There are never any victors in war; both sides lose and it is the families that have to pay the price and suffer the most. As someone once said 'Wars are created by politicians, compounded by bureaucrats and fought by soldiers.' The next day photographs were taken and Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal returned to Delhi. Later the photos reached Delhi along with a note from Brigadier Naser that said: In popular culture Allu Sirish reprised Arun Khetarpal's character as Lt Chinmay in the 2017 Malayalam film 1971: Beyond Borders. A biopic on Arun Khetarpal is being directed by Sriram Raghavan displaying his courage in the 1971 Battle of Basantar. Actor Varun Dhawan will be playing the lead role in the film.

She was the paternal grandmother of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. She is also the paternal great-great-great grandmother of Elizabeth II. Family Princess Louise was the only daughter of Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and his first wife Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, daughter of Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (her namesake). Marriage and issue Ernest (right) and Albert, shortly before her exile from court On 31 July 1817 in Gotha, sixteen-year-old Louise married her thirty-three-year-old kinsman Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld, (later Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), after he failed to win the hand of a Russian grand duchess.Grey, p. 29. Louise was considered \\"young, clever, and beautiful\\".Weintraub, p. 21. They had two children: Ernst, who inherited his father's lands and titles, and Albert, who was later the husband of Queen Victoria. The marriage was unhappy because of Ernst's infidelities and the couple separated in 1824. St. Wendel, in the Principality of Lichtenberg, was assigned as her new residence (it was an exclave of Saxe- Coburg und Gotha; see Sotnick on this period), and Louise was forced to leave her two sons behind. Biographer Lytton Strachey noted in 1921: \\"The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumored that the Duchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction, was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.\\" Post-divorce On 31 March 1826 their marriage was officially dissolved. Seven months later, on 18 October 1826, Louise secretly married in St. Wendel her former lover, the Baron Alexander von Hanstein (later created Count of P√∂lzig and Beiersdorf). In her previous marriage, she had taken great interest in the social life of the principality and was revered as its Landesmutter (literally, \\"mother of the region\\"). Nevertheless, this happy life ended in February 1831, when her secret marriage to von Hanstein was discovered and she lost her children permanently. Louise died of cancer on 30 August 1831, when she was only 30 years old. Years after her death, Queen Victoria described Louise in an 1864 memorandum: \\"The princess is described as having been very handsome, though very small; fair, with blue eyes; and Prince Albert is said to have been extremely like her\\".Grey, p. 30. Louise was reinterred from her initial burial site at Morizkirche to the ducal mausoleum at ' after it had been completed in 1859.

After 1815, the county of WƒÖgrowiec (Powiat WƒÖgrowiec) was re-established, but some parts of land were moved out of it for the sake of other Polish counties (powiats). New administrational changes were applied in 1887, when the county of ≈ªnin was created, and Rusiec and Srebrna G√≥ra were associated with it. Srebrna G√≥ra sent only one soldier for the Thirteen Years' War.  The Palace Complex  There is a palace complex in Srebrna G√≥ra dating to the end of the 17th century, most likely built shortly after 1792. The palace, together with two ground-floor annexes of four-column porticos, is situated on a hill in front of the parish church. The buildings of the complex surround a large yard preceded by a gate. The date written on the gate ‚Äì 1799 ‚Äì may refer to the palace annexes, not the palace itself. The oriented palace is a nine-axial, ground-floor building with a classical order portico. The two pairs of protruded columns are of considerably slim proportions, and have simplified Ionic capitals. The high, hip-and-valley roof is covered with tiles. The whole complex is surrounded by a wall finished with a balustrade assembly. Inside, a large hall leads to the main parlour, where a row connects the parlour and rooms situated to the right and left. Located behind the palace, there are five ponds situated on a park landscape. Today, the palace is used as a \\"House of Social Aid\\".  St. Nicholas Church  Near the palace complex, there is a parish church under the appellation of Saint Nicholas that was built in 1848‚Äì1849. The original church was burnt in a fire, but was rebuilt with the preservation of late classical and eclectic features. The meetings of the \\"Catholic Society of Polish Workers\\" may have been held in the parish parlour of the church. The Society was active in Srebrna G√≥ra during World War I and the interwar period.

A prequel was released one year later entitled Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix. A remake, Fear Effect Reinvented, was announced on August 21, 2017.  Gameplay  Fear Effect features gameplay with unshaded characters textured to resemble cel-shading, notably being one of the first games to attempt the technique. Rather than using pre-rendered 2D backgrounds, the environments are composed of streaming or looping full-motion video. As a consequence, the game is composed of four discs. There are also puzzles interspersed between action sequences, similar to other games of the survival horror genre. The player controls one of three mercenaries (either Hana, Deke, or Glas) through areas filled with human and non-human enemies. The game controls are similar to traditional survival horror tank controls, with an exception being that the characters can run and shoot simultaneously. When wielding two guns (one in each hand), they are also able to shoot multiple enemies at the same time. Another feature is the ability to duck and roll; while facing a number of the armed foes, the player can roll a short distance and avoid taking enemy fire. The game's title refers to the player's life bar, a meter which resembles a pulsing EKG. When the player is damaged, the green line of the EKG will pulse faster and turn red. It is possible to 'regain' health by performing acts that will calm that character's heart rate. These include solving a puzzle or sneaking behind a guard to perform a stealth kill. Both will be rewarded with a health boost that brings the meter back to green. Plot When Wee Ming, the daughter of a powerful Hong Kong Triad boss disappears, a trio of mercenaries search for her in the city. They have not been hired to find her, but they intend to kidnap the girl before her father's men locate her and hold her for ransom. Wee Ming has vanished into the fictional Shan Xi protectorate; Hana Tsu-Vachel, the lead character and femme fatale of the group, used to work in a brothel somewhere in that region. Hana arrives in Hong Kong accompanied by her partners, Royce Glas and Jacob \\"Deke\\" DeCourt. What begins as a simple snatch and grab turns into a fiasco: The father of the runaway, Mr. Lam, attributes his fortune and power to a pact he made with demons long ago. Wee Ming, who is a paper doll given life, has been scheduled to serve as a sacrifice to Yim Lau Wong, the mythical \\"King of Hell\\". Hana's contact inside Mr. Lam's organization, Jin, is discovered, tortured, and left to die with a bomb strapped to his chest. Hana frees him, but he is killed shortly after. Meanwhile, Glas is attacked by a VTOL jet and forced to flee into Mr. Lam's building. After avenging Jin, Hana is captured and beaten by Mr. Lam and his thugs. Glas is able to rescue Hana, and the duo make their escape where they meet Deke in front of the hotel they are staying at. While listening to Jin's last message for Hana, the trio are forced off a bridge but are able to swim to a junk. While sailing down a river, Deke spots Wee Ming amongst a burning village. Deke and Glas give chase while Hana gets dressed, but all three are separated by the undead villagers. They stumble upon a military train where the hostile soldiers shoot anyone on sight for fear of the villagers. Hana and Deke wreck the train trying to steal it, but Glas is able to find a jeep with Wee Ming sitting inside. She asks to be taken to a Madam Chen's restaurant, which doubles as a brothel, hoping to find answers about her existence. When Glas is caught sneaking in the brothel, Mr. Lam surprises him, cutting off his left arm. At the same time, Deke is murdered while trying to infiltrate the brothel from upstairs. Hana sneaks in by dressing up like one of the prostitutes, where she runs into Wee Ming again after she had been dragged off by Madam Chen, who is working for Mr. Lam. Wee Ming's powers activate, after being splashed with Deke's blood, transforming the working girls and Madam Chen's thugs into demons. The one-armed Glas reawakens in a meat locker, surprised to find he is still alive; he surmises that Mr. Lam must be planning a slow death for him. Wee Ming arrives and tries her best aid him. When Hana storms in to confront her former boss, Madam Chen, she learns that Chen is actually a demon in disguise. In the ensuing fight, Chen and her minions are killed, but Mr. Lam disappears with his daughter into a portal to Hell. Determined to save Wee Ming from whatever fate Mr. Lam has in store for her, Hana follows them into the portal, with Glas reawakening, and frees himself to give chase. In a surreal journey through Hell, Hana meets the Black and White Guards of Impermanence who give her cryptic messages about her fate. Glas encounters the reanimated corpse of Deke, who is being tortured for the many murders he has committed. Deke takes on a grotesque demonic form and attacks Glas. After he is victorious, Glas promises to avenge Deke. Meanwhile, Hana confronts Yim Lau Wong, who explains that Hell has become overburdened with the souls of the guilty. Once Wee Ming is returned to the netherworld, Yim Lau Wong will be able to expand the reaches of Hell and consume Earth. Hana was chosen to look after Wee Ming because Yim Lau Wong desired someone \\"ruthless\\" to be her guardian. Glas reappears and tries to kill Wee Ming, believing her to be the root of the chaos. During the tense standoff between Hana and Glas, the player is given a choice over which of them should die. This decision will determine the final boss as well as the subsequent ending. On the \\"Hard\\" difficulty setting, a third option will become available: spare the lives of both Glas and Hana. In this ending, the pair emerge from the smoldering wreckage of the brothel, where they find a befuddled Deke sitting on a toilet. Deke has no memory of being killed, believing he has taken a bump to the head, and asks how they made out on the \\"deal\\". As he hoists himself out of the pit, Glas is stunned to realize that his left arm has been completely restored. The three partners walk off into the sunrise to continue their exploits. Reception Fear Effect received generally positive review from critics. Edge praised the game's tight script and distinctive graphics, but criticized its unbalanced gameplay and clumsy control system, stating that they \\"make the boss encounters absurdly difficult\\". The magazine concluded that, \\"In such a beautiful cinematic game, featuring clever plotting and scripting, such deficiencies are even more offensive.\\" Blake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"One of the most exciting and innovative adventures to show up on PlayStation, dragged down only slightly by a few sticky gameplay issues.\\" Legacy A prequel titled Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix was released in 2001 for the PlayStation. In 2016, Fear Effect Sedna was announced after French studio Sushee pitched the idea to Square Enix. In August 2017, Square Enix announced a remake of Fear Effect titled Fear Effect Reinvented. Reinvented is being developed by MegaPixel Studio S.A. and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

His father Bror \\"Bunta\\" Wahlroos held a high position in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. His mother is a long-time friend of Martti Ahtisaari, president of Finland (1994‚Äì2000) and they both worked in Africa. In terms of political economy viewpoint, Bj√∂rn Wahlroos is known as a defender of laissez-faire economics, a fighter against Keynesian economics. He owns a mansion in Salo in Finland and a second mansion in Nice in France in addition an apartment in Stockholm.  Career  After graduation from gymnasium in 1971 Bj√∂rn Wahlroos studied at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki. He graduated as a M.Sc. in 1975 and got his D.Sc. in 1979. The following years were spent in academia; as an acting professor of economics at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki and as a visiting professor at Brown University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Illinois, United States. In 1985 Wahlroos switched career to banking, joining the executive board of Union Bank of Finland (Suomen Yhdyspankki). In 1988 he was appointed Executive vice president and Head of Investment Banking & Treasury at the Union Bank of Finland. Together with half a dozen of his colleagues Wahlroos bought out the investment banking operations of UBF in 1992 and started the partnership Mandatum & Co, which soon became the leading advisor of mergers and acquisitions in Scandinavia. Through a merger with Interbank in 1998 Mandatum was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In 2000 Wahlroos merged his banking group into Sampo-Leonia and took over as President and CEO of the combined company, also becoming its biggest private shareholder. In 2009 Wahlroos resigned as CEO and was elected Chairman of Sampo plc, holding company of Sampo Group, which by then had become the biggest insurer in Northern Europe and also the main shareholder of Nordea, the region's largest bank. In March 2011 he was elected as the Chairman of Nordea. Wahlroos is also Chairman of the Board of UPM-Kymmene, the pulp and paper manufacturer.  Politics  While a student, Wahlroos was involved in left-wing politics. He was a member of Finlands Svenska Skolungdomsf√∂rbundet in 1969‚Äì1973 and communist revolutionary student association Sosialistiset taloustieteen opiskelijat in 1971‚Äì1973. He left extreme leftist politics in 1973. After this he has withdrawn from active party politics although he is a paying member of the Swedish People's Party. He has nevertheless given public comments that give an indication of his thoughts. In 2001, he declared himself in favour of a citizen's income in Finland.http://www.lausti.com/newsviews/may2001/wahlroos.html \\"Basic security, in my mind, must never be threatened because it is an important part of human modern society\\", Wahlroos said in the Finnish newspaper Uutisp√§iv√§ Demari, clearing way to negative income tax thinking. In March 2009 Wahlroos predicted that the economic recession would not endure for long, because the market corrects itself quickly. In March 2010, in an interview in Image magazine, he spoke of the need to cut Finnish development aid because \\"we have 50 years of money thrown into a bottomless well\\". In addition, he has criticized giving grants to university students because it, according to Wahlroos, \\"supports idleness\\", and regards agricultural and forestry research expenditures as excessive. In June 2010 Wahlroos told the Financial Times that Europe will have to reconsider the future of the Social market economy model, because people cannot be taxed in the future in the current fashion, and poverty and broken families are unsustainable. Wahlroos also believes that agricultural subsidies should be abolished throughout the world: \\"It is absurd that Finland is with one hand supporting the Zambian agribusiness and the other the EU common agricultural policy. (...) ...giving to developing countries at the same time ... when the EU is to abolish agricultural subsidies and open tariff barriers on agricultural products.\\" At the same time he receives remarkable agricultural subsidies himself. In 2015 Wahlroos published a book defending his laissez-faire economics viewpoint, \\"De tio s√§msta ekonomiska teorierna.

East Indiaman was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the East India trading companies of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. The term is used to refer to vessels belonging to the Austrian, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, or Swedish companies. Some of the East Indiamen chartered by the British East India Company were known as \\"tea clippers\\". In Britain, the Honourable East India Company held a monopoly granted to it by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1600 for all English trade between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, which was progressively restricted during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, until the monopoly was lost in 1834. English (later British) East Indiamen usually ran between England, the Cape of Good Hope and India, where their primary destinations were the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The Indiamen often continued on to China before returning to England via the Cape of Good Hope and Saint Helena. When the company lost its monopoly, the ships of this design were sold off. A smaller, faster ship known as a Blackwall Frigate was built for the trade as the need to carry heavy armaments declined. Description of the sailing vessels and the trade Amsterdam \\"East Indiaman\\" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the East India Companies of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. These include the Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese and Swedish East India companies. East Indiamen carried both passengers and goods, and were armed to defend themselves against pirates. Initially, the East Indiamen were built to carry as much cargo as possible, rather than for speed of sailing. The East India company had a monopoly on trade with India and China, supporting this design. East Indiamen were the largest merchant ships regularly built during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, generally measuring between 1100 and 1400 tons burthen (bm). Two of the largest were the Earl of Mansfield and Lascelles being built at Deptford in 1795. The Royal Navy purchased both, converted them to 56-gun fourth rates, and renamed them Weymouth and Madras respectively. They measured 1426 tons (bm) on dimensions of approximately 175 feet overall length of hull, 144 feet keel, 43 feet beam, 17 feet draft. In England, Queen Elizabeth I granted an exclusive right to the trade to the East India Company in 1600. This monopoly lasted until 1834. The company grew to encompass more than the trade between England and India, but the ships described in this article are the type used in the 17th to the early 19th centuries to carry the trade. During the wars with France During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars they were often painted to resemble warships; an attacker could not be sure if gunports were real or merely paint, and some Indiamen carried sizable armaments. The Royal Navy acquired several East Indiamen, turning them into fourth rates (e.g., HMS Weymouth and HMS Madras, described above), maintaining the confusion for military ships seeking merchant ships as prizes of war. In some cases the East Indiamen successfully fought off attacks by the French. One of the most celebrated of these incidents occurred in 1804, when a fleet of East Indiamen and other merchant vessels under Commodore Nathaniel Dance successfully fought off a marauding squadron commanded by Admiral Linois in the Indian Ocean in the Battle of Pulo Aura. Due to the need to carry heavy cannon, the hull of the East Indiamen ‚Äì in common with most warships of the time ‚Äì was much wider at the waterline than at the upper deck, so that guns carried on the upper deck were closer to the centre-line to aid stability. This is known as tumblehome. The ships normally had two complete decks for accommodation within the hull and a raised poop deck. The poop deck and the deck below it were lit with square-windowed galleries at the stern. To support the weight of the galleries, the hull lines towards the stern were full. Later ships built without this feature tended to sail faster, which put the East Indiamen at a commercial disadvantage once the need for heavy armament passed. Ships for the India-China trade East Indiamen in a Gale, by thumb George Carter According to historian Fernand Braudel, some of the finest and largest Indiamen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were built in India, making use of Indian shipbuilding techniques and crewed by Indians, their hulls of Indian teak being especially suitable for local waters. These ships were used for the China run. Until the coming of steamships, these Indian-built ships were relied upon almost exclusively by the British in the eastern seas. None sailed to Europe and they were banned from English ports. Many hundreds of Indian-built Indiamen were built for the British, along with other ships, including warships. Notable among them were Surat Castle (1791), a 1,000-ton (bm) ship with a crew of 150, Lowjee Family, of 800 tons (bm) and a crew of 125, and Shampinder (1802), of 1,300 tons (bm). Notable ships G√∂theborg in 2005 Another significant East Indiaman in this period was the 1176-ton (bm) Warley that John Perry built at his Blackwall Yard in 1788, and which the Royal Navy bought in 1795 and renamed . In 1803 she was employed as a transport to establish a settlement at Port Phillip in Australia, later shifted to the site of current-day Hobart, Tasmania by an accompanying ship, the Ocean. French forces captured Calcutta in 1805 off the Isles of Scilly. She grounded at the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, and was burned by a British boarding party after her French crew had abandoned her. The 1200-ton (bm) Arniston was likewise employed by the Royal Navy as a troop transport between England and Ceylon. In 1815, she was wrecked near Cape Agulhas with the loss of 372 lives after a navigation error that was caused by inaccurate dead reckoning and the lack of a marine chronometer with which to calculate her longitude. End of the era of East Indiamen sailing ships East Indiaman \\"Madagascar\\", circa 1837 With the progressive restriction of the monopoly of the British East India Company the desire to build such large armed ships for commercial use waned, and during the late 1830s a smaller, faster ship known as a Blackwall Frigate was built for the premium end of the India and China trades. The last of the East Indiamen was reputed to be the Java (1813‚Äì1939) that became a coal hulk, then was broken up. In literature The Battle of Pulo Aura is featured in Patrick O'Brian's novel HMS Surprise, with French Admiral Linois in pursuit of a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS Surprise under Captain Aubrey organizes the merchantmen to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were merchantmen. In the Aubrey-Maturin series, East Indiamen are involved in many of the novels, including the second set in the Peace of Amiens, where some of the sailors took positions on East Indiamen. In other of the novels, Aubrey intercepts enemy vessels that interfere with the merchant ships, earning their gratitude.

Wang is one of the leading figures behind China's foreign affairs, along with Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang. Between 2012 and 2017, Wang had served as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party's anti-corruption body, and a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest decision making body. He was instrumental in carrying out General Secretary Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign since 2013. Wang gained prominence in China's financial sector in the late 1980s. In 1994, Wang became the Governor of the China Construction Bank. Wang then successively served in three regional roles: Vice-Governor of Guangdong, Party Secretary of Hainan, and Mayor of Beijing. Wang then served as Vice-Premier in charge of finance and commercial affairs under premier Wen Jiabao from March 2008 to March 2013, during which he also gained a seat on the party's Politburo. Currently Wang is considered to be among Xi Jinping's closest political allies.  Early life  Wang Qishan was born in Qingdao, Shandong, but his ancestral hometown is considered Tianzhen, Shanxi. After graduating high school, Wang worked as a sent-down youth in the countryside, performing manual labour with peasants on a commune in the revolutionary heartland of Yan'an, where he met and befriended Xi Jinping. In 1973, Wang was admitted as a \\"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\\" at Northwest University in Xi'an, where he studied history and graduated in 1976. Wang met Yao Mingshan (), the daughter of Yao Yilin, in Yan'an and the two later wed. After graduation, Wang worked in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, researching late imperial Chinese history (1800s onwards) and Republican era (1912-1949) history. In 1982, Yao Yilin became an alternate member of the Central Secretariat, and Wang was elevated to the Secretariat's office on rural policy research. This marked the beginning of Wang's political career. Career in finance From 1982 to 1988, Wang worked in various posts in policy research. In 1988, Wang was transferred to become the chief executive of the Agricultural Investment Trust of China. A year later he became Vice Governor at China Construction Bank. Wang became Governor of the China Construction Bank in 1994 and served until 1997. During this time, Wang facilitated cooperation with U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley, and was instrumental in the founding of China's first investment bank, the China International Capital Corp (CICC), and served as its first executive Chairman. In 1997, Wang was transferred to Guangdong to become its Executive Vice Governor, one of the highest posts in the provincial government. At the height of the Asian Financial Crisis, Wang assisted then Guangdong Party Secretary Li Changchun in managing non-performing loans of various state owned enterprises in the province. Since then, Wang developed a reputation for being a \\"financial specialist\\" in Premier Zhu Rongji's cabinet. Next, Wang served as the General Office chief of the State Economic Structural Reform Commission ().  Mayor of Beijing and Vice-Premiership  Wang took over from disgraced Beijing mayor Meng Xuenong when SARS struck the city in spring 2003, at which time he had only served as the Party Secretary in Hainan for five months. After arriving in Beijing, Wang took an open approach to the release of information about SARS to the public. In contrast to the lack of transparency during the administration of his predecessor, Wang called for a daily press release on the latest information about SARS. Wang was confirmed as Mayor of Beijing in early 2004. As mayor, Wang also served as the executive chair of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG). In March 2005, during a local radio show, Wang apologized on air to the Beijing public for an ongoing natural gas supply shortage in the city. The action won praise in the media and was said to have decreased the perceived distance between government officials and the public. Wang was known to be frank and responsible. In 2007, he became a member of the 17th Central Committee and the 17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China; in 2008, he was named a Vice Premier of the State Council, in charge of finance and commerce. In 2009, Wang was appointed by President Hu Jintao as his special representative to chair the Economic Track of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue for the Chinese side. George Osborne with Wang Qishan outside the Institute of Directors in London, 8 September 2011 Wang was named as one of the most influential people in the world in the 2009 Time 100 list.\\"Wang Qishan\\" by Hank Paulson  Politburo Standing Committee and anti-corruption  Wang Qishan and former State Councilor Dai Bingguo holding a basketball in the Oval Office with U.S. President Barack Obama (2009) In the lead-up to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Wang was seen by observers as a rising political star, with a diverse political pedigree spanning the realms of high finance, regional government, and policy development and execution. Wang ultimately entered the ranks of the Politburo Standing Committee, considered the pinnacle of power in China, at the 18th Party Congress, taking on the job of the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body. Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the same Congress. The appointment was unexpected given Wang's experience in the economic realm; he was seen as a more likely candidate for executive Vice-Premier. The decision to hand Wang the disciplinary portfolio seemed to have come as a surprise even to Wang himself: in video footage of a leaked CCDI conference after taking the helm of the body, Wang said of the decision, \\"you can go look at media reports before the 18th Congress, who knew Wang Qishan was going to become secretary of the CCDI?... That's how things work. You do what the party tells you to do.\\" Wang's assuming the leading anti-corruption post was believed to be at least partly owing to his relationship with Xi Jinping. Wang was friends with Xi beginning in their youth, they shared a bunk when they were both performing manual labour in Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution, and Wang lent Xi books related to economics; Wang also had dealings with Xi during the latter's time as a regional official in Fujian. Wang Qishan meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and Acting U. S. Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 2012 Beginning in late 2012, Wang emerged as the public face of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, the most far-reaching campaign of its sort since the founding of the Communist-ruled state in 1949. He also became the Leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work, responsible for dispatching teams to the provinces and state-owned enterprises with the goal of rooting out corruption. Following the 18th Party Congress, Wang was often considered the second most powerful man in China, second only to Xi, the Party General Secretary (paramount leader).China‚Äôs second most powerful leader is admired and feared, The Economist Wang became a favourite of the media. In October 2015, the CCDI under Wang's leadership released a new and complete set of regulations on party disciplinary procedures and rules on party member conduct, a document aimed at institutionalizing the party's ability to discipline its members and reduce corruption. Additionally, Wang introduced for the first time a set of disciplinary procedures for party disciplinary officials themselves. Wang's anti-corruption work gained him accolades within the party leadership, with many calling for an extension of his term at the 19th Party Congress in 2017. Since the 16th Party Congress, the rule of \\"seven-up, eight-down\\" had been informally applied for every Politburo Standing Committee member (i.e., if a Standing Committee member is 68 at a time of the Congress, he must step down, but if he is 67, he can continue to hold a seat). If Wang were to continue his term past 2017, he would break this convention. Wang himself was reluctant to this possibility. During a press conference, Wang stated, \\"if I were a department-level chief, I would be long retired. Even if I were a deputy minister or a minister, I would be retired by now.\\" China watchers expect Wang to hold another high position during Xi Jinping's second term of Party General Secretary, owing to the fact that his name was not mentioned among those senior party leaders slated for retirement (). Wang has also accompanied Xi on private meetings with the US ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, in recent weeks. In 17 March 2018, he became the Vice President of China.  Personal life  Wang is married to Yao Mingshan, daughter of former first Vice Premier of China Yao Yilin; Wang does not have children. He is sometimes considered a \\"princeling\\" through his marriage. Yao Mingshan's sister is Yao Mingduan, the husband of Yao Mingduan is Meng Xuenong. Meng Xuenong is the former Mayor of Beijing, former Governor of Shanxi, and former member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson said that Wang is \\"decisive and inquisitive\\" and \\"an avid historian, enjoys philosophical debates and has a wicked sense of humor\\". Paulson writes, \\"He is a Chinese patriot, but he understands the U.S. and knows that each of our two countries benefits from the other's economic success. And he is bold ‚Äî he takes on challenges, does things that have never been done before and succeeds. Wang managed the largest bankruptcy restructuring in China's history in 1998 and thereby prevented a banking crisis that could have crippled the country's growth.\\" Wang is a fan of the American television show House of Cards, and frequently alluded to the show during anti-corruption conferences; Wang said he was especially fascinated by the role of the party whip. He also said he watched some Korean dramas. Wang said, \\"Korea dramas are ahead of us, yet the core and soul of Korean dramas [represents] an advancement from [art forms seen] in traditional Chinese culture.\\"  References   External links  * Biography of Wang QishanXinhua * Wang Qishan biography @ China Vitae * Wang Qishan leaves Beijing Mayor post, leaves a legacy (Xinhua) * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Beijing Category:Politicians from Qingdao Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Shandong Category:Regional leaders in the People's Republic of China Category:Sent-down youths Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shandong Category:Political office-holders in Hainan Category:Members of the 18th Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Secretaries of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Category:Members of the 17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China Category:China Construction Bank people Category:Recipients of the Nishan-e- Pakistan ","title":"Wang Qishan"},{"id":"2185783","text":"South Hills is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

It sought to establish a new body of universal investment laws that would grant corporations unconditional rights to engage in financial operations around the world, without any regard to national laws and citizens' rights. The draft gave corporations a right to sue governments if national health, labor or environment legislation threatened their interests. When its draft became public in 1997, it drew widespread criticism from civil society groups and developing countries, particularly over the possibility that the agreement would make it difficult to regulate foreign investors. After an intense global campaign was waged against the MAI by the treaty's critics, the host nation France announced in October 1998 that it would not support the agreement, effectively preventing its adoption due to the OECD's consensus procedures. Background International direct investment has been taking place in various forms and to different degrees for over a century. Attempts to establish a framework for the protection of foreign investments dates back to the 1920s, most notably negotiating a League of Nations draft convention. Starting from the second half of the twentieth century, the investment protection was developed through the bilateral investment treaties (BIT), which are signed between two countries and which state the desired conditions under which investment can take place between them. The first BIT, between West Germany and Pakistan, was signed in 1959 and their numbers have grown steadily since then, although research suggests that BITs do little to increase foreign investment. In 1965, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) was established in the framework of the United Nations, and in 1967, the OECD prepared the Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property although this was not adopted. The number of bilateral investment agreements increased rapidly during the 1990s as countries and investors sought more regulation for security, certainty and mobility for their investments after it became clear that the Uruguay Round's Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) addressed only part of investment-related concerns and did not provide enough security for investors nor strong controls on host governments to regulate multinational corporations. In addition to these instruments, in 1992 the World Bank adopted Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment. In 1994 the Energy Charter Treaty provided an example of a multilateral investment agreement, though limited to the energy sector. Noam Chomsky argued that the OECD, as an organization made up solely of rich countries, was more susceptible to direct influence by transnational corporate forces than alternative fora with more universal membership such as United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).Domestic Constituencies Z Magazine May 1998, at chomsky.info  Purposes and provisions  While authorizing the negotiations, the OECD Ministerial Council aimed to reach a \\"broad multilateral framework for international investment with high standards for the liberalization of investment regimes and investment protection and with effective dispute- settlement procedures\\". The aim was to create more consistent, secure and stable investment conditions and to regulate investment in a more uniform, transparent and enforceable manner. Although the agreement was to be negotiated between the member states, the intention was to have an open agreement to which non-OECD members could accede on a negotiated basis. According to MAI supporter Sergio Marchi, who was Canada's Minister of International Trade at the time, one of the main purposes of the agreement was to eliminate the \\"patchwork\\" of investment rules enshrined in the then-1300+ bilateral investment treaties. Contrary to many critics, he argued that the MAI would help prevent a \\"race to the bottom\\" that would undermine high standards of Canadian regulation. More specifically, the agreement would: * Minimise the diverse state regulations in governing the conditions under which investments by foreign corporations could take place. (In this connection, the agreement embodied acceptance of a compliance regime under which liberalization must proceed forward with no ability to be wound back -- the so-called ratchet effect. This would be enforced by so-called rollback and standstill provisions, to ensure that investors would have access to markets. These provisions required nations to eliminate regulations that violated MAI provisions -- either immediately or over a set period of time -- and to refrain from passing any such laws in the future.)Mechanisms for standstill, rollback and listing of country specific reservations Note by MAI Negotiating Group chairman, OECD, 15 February 1996 * Enable compensation to corporations for proven unfair or discriminatory investment conditions causing loss of profit. * Allow states and corporations recourse to international arbitration (for instance, through the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) to settle any disputes arising under the agreement,OECD, Negotiating Group on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, Draft Consolidated Text of 11 February 1998, document DAFFE/MAI (98)7, pp. 58-64. instead of national courts in the host state. The MAI was supported by both the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC) and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC). While BIAC was interested in stable and consistent treatment of investment, TUAC was interested on setting standards on employment and industrial relations.  Negotiations  The negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment were formally launched by the OECD's Ministerial Council in May 1995 and they commenced in September 1995. The negotiations were carried out by a high-level negotiating group consisting of officials from the OECD member states, but working outside the OECD committee structure consulting with the non-member countries. The chairperson of the negotiating group was Frans Engering (Netherlands) and vice-chairpersons were Al Larson (United States) and A. Saiki (Japan). The target deadline to finish the negotiations, set by the OECD Ministerial Council, was mid-1997. There was little public awareness of the details of MAI negotiations until a draft of the agreement was leaked in March 1997. The leaked material prompted criticism from different NGOs globally. As a result, the negotiations failed in 1998 when first France and then other countries successively withdrew after pressure from a global movement of NGOs, citizens' groups and a number of governments of developing countries. In April 1998, the negotiations were formally suspended for six months. On 3 December 1998, the OECD announced that \\"negotiations on the MAI are no longer taking place\\".

Net Resistance, Net > Benefits: Opposing MAI in Social Alternatives, Vol. 19, No. 1, January 2000, > pp. 47-51. The international protests against the MAI were the first example of such mass-activism to deploy the Internet. The internet was central both in gathering information and in promulgating critical materials among members of a vast worldwide network. The movement's main argument was that the most influential mass media and politicians had vested interests in the MAI. Even their opponents ruefully acknowledged that the activists possessed highly qualified, eloquent analysts and leaders‚Äîand were able to use the new internet technology to devastating effect. French MEP Catherine Lalumi√®re stated: \\"These organisations have refined and diffused to all countries an anti-MAI position which is now expressed in similar terms throughout the diverse countries of the OECD.\\" =Active opposition= According to Theodore H. Cohn in Global Political Economy Theory and Practice (2005), \\"[t]he most effective opposition to the MAI was launched by a wide-ranging coalition of civil society NGOs. These NGOs argued that the MAI would threaten protection of human rights, labor and environmental standards, and least developed countries. A particular concern was that the MAI would result in a \\"race to the bottom\\" among countries willing to lower their labor and environmental standards to attract foreign investment. The origin of organised opposition was traced by Katia Tieleman in her 2000 UN case study: Using a variety of websites, NGOs mobilized a strong and diverse opposition composed of human rights groups, labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates. p. 350 =Arguments= MAI opponents pointed to a perceived threat to national sovereignty.Leslie Sklair, \\"The Transnational Capitalist Class\\" (Blackwell, 2001), p. 90. and democracy and argued that it would involve participating nations in a \\"race to the bottom\\" in environmental and labor standards. The MAI prompted criticism that it appeared to establish a new body of universal investment laws to guarantee corporations excessive powers to buy, sell and undertake financial operations all over the world, severely diluting national laws, e.g., on environmental protection, regulation of labour standards and human rights established in developed countries. By their arguments, the draft proposed a North American Free Trade Agreement-style investor-state dispute settlement tribunal in which corporations could sue governments if legislation (e.g., for national health, labor or environment), threatened their interests or were considered to expropriate actual or potential assets and/or profits. Mark Vallianatos, of Friends of the Earth, argued that: * The MAI would restrict governments' ability to limit the participation of foreign multinationals in industries. \\"For example,\\" he wrote, \\"the Philippines currently bans foreign investment in rural banking, and Honduras limits foreign investors in forestry to a minority stake\\". These restrictions would not be acceptable within the MAI. * The agreement would establish the principle of \\"national treatment\\" (in which government must treat foreign companies as favorably as domestic companies) as the norm for international investment. Indeed, in some cases, foreign corporations might have stronger protections than domestic investors. \\"The MAI bars many types of performance requirements, or conditions, even if those conditions are imposed on local companies. Examples of forbidden conditions include requiring investors to form a partnership with a local company and requiring a minimum number of local employees--the types of policies governments use to help ensure that local people benefit from foreign investment.\\" * \\"The MAI matters because its rules can be enforced. If a foreign investor thinks a country where it has invested is violating the MAI, the investor has a choice: to complain to its own government, which can take the host country to binding international arbitration, or to directly challenge the host country. In either case, the arbitration process is closed. Mark Vallianatos (Friends of the Earth), July, 1997.

In Montreal, on May 25, 1998, the Montreal Conference on Globalized Economies was nonviolently blockaded for five hours by hundreds of activists in what was called Operation SalAMI,Operation SalAMI based on the French acronym of the proposed agreement, AMI, referring not only the sausage, but also to a \\"dirty friend\\". Operation SalAMI demanded that Canada withdraw from the negotiations on the MAI. The presence of one key MAI player, Donald Johnston (General Secretary of the OECD) at the conference helped to focus the action, one of the three most important anti-MAI events in the world. These mobilizations on an international scale actually led to the shelving of the agreement. The award-winning documentary Pressure Point: Inside the Montreal Blockade recorded the drama of this action where 100 people were arrested.\\"Pressure Point - Inside the Montreal Blockade\\" =United States= A strong campaign was led by Lori Wallach of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, and a coordinated network (\\"50 Years is Enough') including Friends of the Earth, the Alliance for Democracy, Witness for Peace, the Sierra Club, the Preamble Center, the Democratic Socialists of America and other groups.Lisa McGowan MAI: NAFTA on Steroids Economic Justice News v.1 No.1, January 1998 =Australia= In November 1997, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme \\"Background Briefing\\" presented the Quiet Debate--a report about the silence of the Australian government and media on an issue which was arousing fierce controversy in the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.

The letter was reinforced by a prominent advertisement in The Australian newspaper on 11 NovemberCopy for Stop MAI's advertisement =France= Catherine Lalumi√®re France's withdrawal followed consideration of a report on the negotiations drawn up by a French MEP, Catherine Lalumi√®re. After receiving this report, prime minister Lionel Jospin addressed the Assembl√©e Nationale on 10 October 1998 and announced his decision to withdraw. He said the Lalumi√®re Report had identified a number of fundamental problems with the agreement, particularly relating to matters of national sovereignty. Madame Lalumi√®re had also concluded that so many reservations were being incorporated into the agreement that any value for French investors would be limited. M. Jospin noted that, in February 1998, the French government had identified respect for cultural differences as a requirement for French support for the agreement. UK Parliament Select Committee on European Scrutiny In particular, he was concerned that the French film industry needed protection against US imports.Devereaux C, Lawrence R. Z., Watkins M. Case Studies in US Trade Negotiation Volume 1: Making the Rules (2006), p.173, at Google Books Of equal or greater significance was the importance accorded by Mme. Lalumi√®re to the global protest movement which at that time she attributed to the work and influence of NGOs: Mme. Lalumi√®re argued, however, that France should continue to pursue further liberalisation of investment r√©gimes though not in the OECD. \\"On the one hand, under these conditions it would be impossible to achieve the balancing of the concessions demanded by the firms and, on the other, the objections of the opponents would be just as fierce.\\" France was followed by a succession of other nations including Canada and Australia whose governments had been under relentless pressure from civil society to abandon or radically revamp the MAI.  Subsequent developments  Proponents of MAI (such as the United States, Canada, and several EU members) continue to promote investment provisions similar to MAI through regional trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties, bilateral free-trade agreements and discussion at the World Trade Organization to be incorporated into the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Before the end of 1998, the UK trade minister Brian Wilson began to announce that investment negotiations could be shifted to the WTO. > The UK Government appears to be taking a surprisingly complacent approach > towards the WTO.

In doing so it is ignoring the > widespread opposition to the MAI and the mounting evidence of the WTO's > abject failings. A senior treasury officer, cited in a 1999 Australian parliamentary report, stated that \\"any future work on the matter known as the MAI needed to address the OECD Ministers' requirement to protect the sovereign right to regulate and to ensure citizens were not harmed by efforts to liberalise foreign investment. There was also a need to continue to engage \\"civil society\\", and to expand participation in the process by countries that were not members of the OECD\\".Parliament of Australia, Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Report 18 (MAI) page 3, para 1.12 An attempt was made to insert the investment agenda into a new \\"Millennium Round\\" of trade liberalisation talks to be hosted by the World Trade Organization (WTO).Christian de Brie, \\"Watch Out for MAI Mark Two,\\" Le Monde diplomatique (May 1999).

His career spanned more than six decades, from 1887 to 1949, and included the role of Algernon Moncrieff in the 1895 premiere of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. Aynesworth generally appeared in drawing room comedy and contemporary high-society dramas, usually avoiding old classics and modern plays about social problems. He retired from the stage in 1938, and made his final acting appearance in the film The Last Days of Dolwyn in 1949. Life and career =Early years= Aynesworth was born at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, the third son of Major-General Edward Abbot-Anderson (1832‚Äì1903) and his first wife, Martha, n√©e Birkett (1835‚Äì1864), who died the day after Aynesworth was born.\\"Edward Abbot Anderson (1832‚Äì1903)\\", Wikitree.

While in France he became an habitu√© of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise, where he studied the techniques of French acting. The Times said of this period in his life: :His determination to be first rate, his respect for acting as an art, his insistence on clarity of diction and intimate timing, his reluctance to undertake parts to which he felt he could not do justice, not least his panache ‚Äì all this could be traced to the influence of the French theatre on him in his formative years.\\"Mr Allan Aynesworth ‚Äì Accomplished Playing of High Comedy\\", The Times, 25 August 1959, p. 10 After returning to England, Aynesworth resolved to pursue a theatrical career, and made his stage debut in April 1887 as an uncredited extra in The Red Lamp by Outram Tristram, produced by and starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 23 April 1887, p. 14 He then went as a student to Sarah Thorne's theatre at Margate, before returning to London in November 1887, when he played a small role in a blank-verse tragedy, The Witch, at the St James's Theatre.

During the First World War theatres were asked to keep open to provide entertainment for troops home on leave. Aynesworth complied, and was in demand as actor, producer and contributor to charity performances. =Later years= With Lottie Venne in The Circle, 1921 In 1921 Aynesworth had one of his biggest successes, in the role of Lord Porteus in Somerset Maugham's The Circle. The Times said that those who saw him would not forget \\"the rotund perfection of his performance\\", and The Play Pictorial commented: The following year Aynesworth had another characteristic success in The Dover Road by A. A. Milne, playing \\"the tremendous butler, Dominic ... an unbelievably grand creature\\".Ervine, St John. \\"The Dover Road\\", The Observer, 11 June 1922, p. 11 The Play Pictorial praised \\"a masterly study of humorous exposition, and every effect is obtained without apparent effort\\".\\"Plays of the Month\\", The Play Pictorial, June 1922, p. 27 In the 1930s Aynesworth continued to appear in West End plays. His Lord Porteus attracted enthusiastic reviews when The Circle was revived in 1931. He maintained a keen interest on the doings of a new generation of actors. Asked by an interviewer in 1937 who he thought were the \\"real thing\\" among the younger actors, he replied, \\"that young fellow who played Hamlet ‚Äì Gielgud ‚Äì yes, he's certainly the real thing; and that other boy... Laurence Olivier, and the little girl who's played some Shakespeare, Margaretta Scott\\".

The organization is based on the belief that solutions and innovations are often found in the grassroots, and therefore works with more than 8,000 community- based groups across the world. These groups help people to help themselves through food production, job-training programs, nutrition education, community economic development, healthcare workshops, youth programming, leadership development and more.  History  Founded in September 1975 by the late musician Harry Chapin and current executive director, radio host Bill Ayres, World Hunger Year began as a commitment between two friends, and has grown into an award-winning global non-profit. After Harry Chapin died in a car crash in 1981, family, friends, fans and the music community worked to ensure that the vision of WHY lived on. Today, WhyHunger still focuses on several fundamental principles: working together to combat the root causes of hunger, poverty and injustice, supporting grassroots solutions and promoting self- reliance.  Programs  WhyHunger's programs work with community-based organizations to build capacity, multiply resources, share stories and develop connections to create a just food system that provides universal access to nutritious and affordable food. = Artists Against Hunger & Poverty = This artists program enlists performing artists to raise funds and awareness for grassroots organizations fighting hunger and poverty across the world. WhyHunger believes that music and the arts are an important tool in making a difference in the world.

Published in 1954, Witchcraft Today recounts Gardner's thoughts on the history and the practices of the witch-cult, and his claim to have met practising witches in 1930s England. It also deals with his theory that the Knights Templar had practised the religion, In Chapter VI, \\"How the Little People became Witches, and Concerning the Knights Templar\\" and that the belief in faeries in ancient, mediaeval and early modern Europe is due to a secretive pygmy race that lived alongside other communities., Chapter V, \\"The Little People\\" and Chapter VI, \\"How the Little People Became Witches, and Concerning the Knights Templar\\" Witchcraft Today is one of the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca, along with Gardner's second book on the subject, 1959's The Meaning of Witchcraft. Gerald Gardner in the foreword to Witchcraft Today: Whilst by the time of writing, Gardner had been initiated into the religion, and had formed his own coven, he did not state this in the book, instead he \\"posed as a disinterested anthropologist\\". page 206 The introduction to the book was written by Margaret Murray, who had widely supported the witch-cult hypothesis in the 1920s and 1930s through her books The Witch-Cult in Western Europe and The God of the Witches. In her introduction, she stated that: In the book Gardner also repeats the claim, which had originated with Matilda Joslyn Gage, that 9 million victims were killed in the European witch-hunts.\\", in the image page between pages 80 and 81 Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft during this time period vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.

It was reprinted in August 1956. Analysis In his biography of Gardner, the researcher Philip Heselton noted that the contents of Witchcraft Today were essentially a summation of what Gardner had read about witchcraft and other related subjects over a number of years. He remarked that Gardner had probably intended to provide a history of the witch- cult from the Stone Age to the present which made reference to related religious movements, such as those of the druids, Knights Templar and ancient Egyptians.

It is the de facto standard for providing accessibility to free and open desktops, like GNU/Linux or OpenBSD, led by the GNOME Project. One common nomenclature to explain an accessibility framework is a usual client-server architecture. In that way, Assistive Technologies (ATs) like screen readers, would be the clients of that framework, and computer applications would be the server. In this architecture, client and server need to communicate with each other, usually using the IPC technology of the platform. Ideally the accessibility framework exposes this to the client and server in a transparent way. Usually the API for both client-side and server-side applications are the same, and the accessibility framework provides a client-side and a server-side implementation of that API. In the case of GNOME, there are two different APIs, one for the client-side (AT-SPI) and a different one for the server-side (Accessibility Toolkit (ATK)) due to historical reasons related to the underlying technologies. Implementations AT-SPI was originally designed for using Common Object Request Broker Architecture, an object-based IPC/RPC technology, for its transport protocol. The AT-SPI specification itself was tied to CORBA as it was defined in CORBA IDL. AT-SPI used the GNOME project own fast and lightweight CORBA implementation, ORBit, and its own framework for creating CORBA components, Bonobo. The GNOME project decided that the 3.0 release will be free of ORBit and Bonobo meaning a D-Bus AT-SPI solution was required. In an effort to move AT-SPI forward, a D-Bus project was started in November 2006. This took the form of a performance and design review available on the GNOME wiki. Work began on the implementation in May 2007. The D-Bus version of AT-SPI, AT-SPI version 2, was released along with GNOME 3.0 in April 2011. Support AT-SPI provides an ATK bridge, so all those widgets systems or applications that implement ATK will automatically communicate all its events, to AT-SPI. The GNOME widget system, GTK+, or Mozilla applications like Firefox and Thunderbird for GNU/Linux implement ATK, so they communicate out-of-box with AT-SPI. However, it is completely possible to use AT-SPI without implementing ATK. The D-Bus migration made possible that Qt added AT-SPI support. Qt implemented its own bridge to AT-SPI that was released in alpha status in August 2011 for testing purposes and it was integrated into Qt for general use a year later.  Development  AT/SPI is part of the GNOME Accessibility Framework that was released in 2001. The main development force behind ATK was the Accessibility Program Office (APO) of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (now Oracle) with contributions from many community members. When Oracle acquired Sun in 2010 they cut developer jobs of full-time developers working on GNOME accessibility components like the Accessibility Toolkit ATK and the Orca screen reader. Since then, it is mainly maintained by the GNOME community.  Maintainers  ATK development has been led by their maintainers with the help of its community. The maintainers so far are: Current: * Mike Gorse Previous: * Mark Doffman * Li Yuan  Other uses  AT-SPI can also be used for automated testing of user interfaces, with tools such as Linux Desktop Testing Project and Dogtail. Licensing AT-SPI is released under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) version 2.

Biography Katherine Towle (far left) in 1946, with Opha May Johnson (far right). They are looking at Opha May Johnson‚Äôs uniform being worn by PFC Muriel Albert. Towle was born in Towle, California on April 30, 1898. (The town was named after her paternal grandfather and uncles who settled there in the 1850s.) She moved with her family to Berkeley, California in 1908. She graduated with honors from University of California, Berkeley in 1920, then later earned a Master's degree in political science in 1935. =Marine Corps career= She came to the Marine Corps from UC Berkeley in 1943. Her first assignment with the new women‚Äôs component was even before public announcement of the establishment of the Women‚Äôs Reserve on February 13, 1943. She was named Women's Reserve (WR) representative for Women's Recruit Depot in the Bronx, with the rank of Captain, USMCWR, (with date of rank February 24, 1943). Colonel Towle was named Director when her predecessor, Colonel Ruth Cheney Streeter, retired on December 7, 1945. She served in that capacity until June 1946. In August of the same year, when the Women‚Äôs Reserve was deactivated, Colonel Towle returned to the University of California as Assistant Dean of Women. Again, after the Congress had authorized the acceptance of women into the regular armed services, the Marine Corps called upon Colonel Towle to direct this organization. On November 4, 1948, she returned to the Corps to become the first Director of Women Marines after they were constituted a regular component. In 1950 the Marine Corps contracted the fashion design house of Mainbocher to design new uniforms for the Women Marines. The prototype of the first Marine Corps women's evening dress uniform was tailored expressly for Colonel Towle. It was first worn in public at the 175th anniversary Marine Corps Birthday Ball in 1950. The uniform included a red tiara with gold embellishments. As another design of evening dress uniform was eventually adopted, Colonel Towle's evening dress uniform was a \\"one of a kind.\\" This uniform is now in the museum collection of Artillery Company of Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. Colonel Towle served as Director of Women Marines until her retirement on April 30, 1953. Her military awards included the Legion of Merit, Navy Commendation Medal, American Campaign Medal and World War Two Victory Medal. Eight days before Colonel Towle's retirement, President Eisenhower created the National Defense Service Medal retroactive to June 27, 1950. She was, thus, eligible for the medal but it is uncertain if she was ever formally awarded it. =University dean= After retiring from the Marine Corps, Towle was succeeded by Colonel Julia Hamblet. Towle was later associated with the University of California at Berkeley in various capacities: as Dean of Women from 1953‚Äì60; as Assistant Dean of Students from 1960‚Äì65; as Dean of Students, 1965‚Äì66; and later as Dean of Students, Emeritus. She was the first female to serve as Dean of Students. =Death= Towle died on March 2, 1986 at her home in California at the age of 87. Legacy In 2005, a new residence hall at U.C. Berkeley was named after Colonel Towle (Katherine A. Towle Hall).

It was declared a national park by the Indonesian government in 2004. The original area of the park was 385.76 km2, but the decision has been made to expand it to 1000 km2. Tesso Nilo National Park houses some of the largest coherent lowland rainforests remaining on Sumatra. The Center for Biodiversity Management has surveyed over 1,800 plots in tropical forests around the world. They found that no other plot has as many vascular plants as in Tesso Nilo.

Flora and fauna Critically endangered Sumatran elephants and Sumatran tigers live here. Conservation and threats The park suffers heavy encroachment from illegal loggers and illegal settlers who clear the park for crops and palm oil plantations, as well as village sites. Already, 28,600 hectares, or about a third of the park, has been deforested. In November 2009, WWF announced that the park had finally been expanded by 44,492 hectares but encroachment still remains a serious problem. According to a WWF report published in June 2013, oil palm plantations cover 36,353 ha of the Tesso Nilo forest complex, with two business groups (Asian Agri and Wilmar Groups) being involved in the trade of the oil palm fruit illegally grown inside the national park. Furthermore, 50 mills operating around the Tesso Nilo forest complex were identified. During drought periods, the forest is susceptible to wildfires. In the October 2006 fires, 1 km2 of the park was burnt. According to 2009 WWF survey, the population of Sumatran elephants had reached 200 in the park, and around 350 elephant in Riau Province.Aditia Maruli: Elephant in Tesa Nilo national park delivers baby in Antara News, February 1, 2011 =Elephant conservation centre= The Belgian government committed to provide 200,000 euros in assistance for the construction of a Sumatran elephant conservation centre in the Tesso Nilo National Park, with the first quarter to be disbursed in 2011.

A revolutionary socialist, he was one of the leading members of the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance before they merged to form Red. He sat as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1993 to 1997, becoming the first socialist to the left of the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party in parliament since 1961. He later lost his position in 1997, and has been a candidate for parliament ever since. He has been a member of the Oslo City Council from 1983 to 1993, and again since 1999. Folkvord has become one of the best-known Norwegian politicians on the left who is not connected with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party. In the early part of his political career Folkvord was a member of the Red Electoral Alliance. Known for working on several corruption cases earned him the nickname the \\"watch dog\\". Folkvord's political views turned to communism and anti-capitalism when he became a member of the Workers' Communist Party. From 1990 to 1997 he was Deputy Leader of the Workers' Communist Party and in 2001 he became Deputy Leader of the Red Electoral Alliance alongside Chris Hartmann.  Early life and career  Folkvord is the son of school principal Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. 29 November 2009. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court. Folkvord and Stabell reported to the police that the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet breached the pimp paragraph of the criminal code. In an interview Folkvord stated that Dagbladet contributed to giving the Norwegian sex market more attention.  Political career  = Council representative = In 1983 Folkvord, along with Liv Finstad, was elected as Red Electoral Alliance representative for the Oslo City Council, taking office on 1 January 1984. According to Aftenposten, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Christian Democratic Party had the most loyal voter base throughout the election. Folkvord was later highly vocal in his opposition towards the decentralisation of health and social services in Oslo where control was to be given to the boroughs. During his early years as member of the City Council Folkvord used most of his time in defending the then \\"current\\" social administration. By the late 1980s Folkvord had earned the nickname \\"watch dog\\", as he usually wanted an \\"independent investigation\\" into corruption matters. This eventually developed into one of his most well- known public traits. When leading an investigation into a corruption case in 1989, which involved several representatives of the Oslo City Council, he said \\"It is possible to sweep corruption and other non-essential nonsense out of City Hall. People only need to persist where necessary\\". Earlier that year, when finding more proof of a so-called corruption scandal, Folkvord asked for assistance from the district attorney urging him to lead an investigation into the matter. By 1990 there were talks within the Red Electoral Alliance towards replacing Folkvord and Athar Ali as City Council representatives in Oslo to make way for more women in the top positions within the party. Folkvord was kept since he was a well-known face with the Norwegian media. By September 1990 Folkvord had demanded a police-run investigation against Conservative Party member Michael Tetzschner, accusing him of corruption and hidden money. These charges were included in a broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). Tetzschner replied to this broadcast stating that \\"The news feature was completely dominated by false information. If the television provider does not make the corrections that are necessary, we'll bring the case to the Complaints Board of the Broadcasting Corporation\\". Folkvord is one of the co-founders of the Oslo party cell, established in early 1991, of the Red Electoral Alliance. While media speculated that he would become the chapter's leader, he denied any such allegations, saying their existed \\"better suited people\\" then him for that post. = Parliament = Folkvord was elected the Red Electoral Alliance's Oslo lead candidate in June 1992. The decision was made based on party leader Aksel N√¶rstad's belief that Folkvord could easily win a seat since he had become a \\"national celebrity\\" of sorts and due to the support Folkvord enjoyed during the 1989 parliamentary election. Folkvord needed 14,000 votes to earn a seat in parliament. In January 1993, at the national convention, several long-standing members discussed the best way to organise Folkvord's Oslo electoral campaign. There was optimism among these members believed, along with N√¶rstad, and they believed before hand that Folkvord would be elected to parliament. The Red Electoral Alliance used a total of for their nationwide 1993 election campaign, two thirds of it being used to support Folkvords campaign in Oslo. When announcing the results the party managed to become the biggest party in six different constituencies: Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, Ankertorget, T√∏yen, Kampen, V√•lerenga and Gamlebyen. Various analysists, and Folkvord himself, believed the Red Electoral Alliance achieved good results in Oslo because of the Socialist Left Party's bad election results in the municipality. When asked what parliamentary committee he wanted to be a member of Folkvord replied that the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs would be an ideal choice because most of the \\"assaults\\" on the working man had their origins in that committee. He was then selected for that very committee in addition to a seat on the Election Committee. He later became elected as a member of the financial committee of parliament. In 1994 Folkvord criticised the Labour Government for exporting weapons to Turkey, which at that time was engaged in a civil war against the Kurdish people. He claimed it violated a parliamentary decision made in 1959 which said that the government would not distribute, or export, weapons to countries involved in a civil war. Folkvord earned the support of the Socialist Left, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party who all sought to end weapon exports to Turkey. The Conservative Party supported the Labour Party's decision however, with the then party leader Jan Petersen claiming that the Kurdish liberators were \\"terrorists\\". According to Arbeiderbladet the Norwegian Government had sold worth of weapons to the Turkish Government in 1989 alone. Folkvord sent a letter to Bj√∏rn Tore Godal, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked if the Norwegian Government had gotten the approval of the parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to sell weapons to Turkey. In a 1967 decree it became illegal to sell weapons to civil war torned countries, and Folkvord believed that Norway should stopp selling weapons to a country which he considered to be embroilled by civil war. On 1 September 1995 Folkvord was arrested by Turkish law enforcement in the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. The Turkish Government said the main reason was his visit to an illegal Kurdish peace festival. That very same day he was flown to Ankara, and later Istanbul and the following day he was delivered back to Norway. Nicolas Rea, a member of the British House of Lords, took a picture of Folkvord during the event. It was claimed that the picture showed Folkvord being beaten by Turkish officials and that the picture was in-turn burnt by the Turkish police when they saw Rea had a camera. In early 1995 Folkvord announced that he would not be a candidate for parliament when his term was over. He later claimed the job was \\"exhausting and stressful\\". In an opinion poll, conducted in August 1997, Folkvords popularity in Oslo had declined while his popularity outside Oslo had increased. During the election the party used on Folkvord's re-election campaign, which was estimated to be around 70% of party's budget estimated to be around . On 12 September various opinion polls showed that Folkvords popularity had increased again in Oslo which gave rise to speculation that Folkvord would win Inger Lise Hus√∏y's seat in parliament because of this sudden rise in popularity. When 99% of the vote in Oslo had been counted the party had managed to earn a disappointing 3.9%, losing its only seat. = 1999 to the 2003 elections = After losing his position in parliament, Folkvord went through a short-period of obscurity. He once again earned media attention when he publicly denounced the Lund Commission. The commission revealed there had been extensive surveillance of Norwegian communists, socialists and other radicals by the Norwegian Police Security Service. Folkvord demanded to be shown his own documentation created during the surveillance. In 1999 Folkvord topped his party's list of candidates running for a seat in the City Council. Folkvord was successful and earned a seat on the City Council while the party noted an increase of 1.3%. Folkvords main goal during the campaign was to earn a third seat for the Red Electoral Alliance, he failed to do so though the party held its two seats on the City Council. The party earned 2% and 2.1% of the vote in the county and municipal elections of 1999. Before the 2001 parliamentary election both Aslak Sira Myhre, leader of the Red Electoral Alliance, and Folkvord stated their intentions of being top candidate for the Red Electoral Alliance. Later, when hearing that Myhre sought to become the party's lead candidate in Oslo, Folkvord told the media he would become third candidat if he was not elected to become the party's lead candidate. A vote was held at the party convention, which resulted in 50 votes for and 62 against Folkvord as lead candidate. Folkvord became third candidate, and Sigrid Angen became second candidate. By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party proposed making Folkvord the new leader of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if he was elected to parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament. By March 2003 Myhre had resigned as leader and Torstein Dahle was elected as his successor. Dahle had been the leading figure of the Red Electoral Alliance in Hordaland since the 1990s. When commenting on his resignation, Myhre commented on his 2001 election in Oslo saying \\"it is sad to resign after a bad election\\". During the 2003 local elections three different polls showed that the Red Electoral Alliance was close to earning three seats on the Oslo City Council. Folkvord stated that if the party managed to earn one extra seat, he would use try removing the right- wing Conservative Party from power and replace them with a more left-wing \\"leaning choice\\" ‚Äî such as the Labour Party or the Socialist Left Party. The party increased its vote by 0.1%, earning the party 3.1% of the popular vote in Oslo. The party was not able to win a third seat, retaining the two they held. = Later years: 2004‚Äìpresent = In February 2004 Folkvord was charged with violating the penal code as he had participated in a demonstration against the Invasion of Iraq in 2003. Together with other demonstrators he effectively cut off the entrance to the office of Kristin Krohn, the Minister of Defence. Folkvord was accused in a statement saying \\"his refusal to walk away from the area where it was held an illegal demonstration, despite the fact that he was asked to leave the area\\". After the incident he received a fine of which he refused to pay. At the Red Electoral Alliance's city convention Folkvord was elected their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, were the only representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards the idea of having any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament. Folkvord later accused many of the prominent members of the Oslo City Council of being involved, or having been involved, in corruption. Andr√© St√∏ylen of the Conservative Party said Folkvord should stop accusing and instead go to the police with proof if he had any. Folkvord (left) during the Oslo thumb On 27 February 2007 Folkvord announced he would seek another term in the City Council. Folkvord was re-elected lead candidate for the municipal election at the party convention. In March 2007 the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party merged and established Red. By 3 September, six days before the election day, Red earned its best showing ever in Oslo earning 4.4% in an opinion poll ‚Äî an increase of 0.3% from the previous election. When the votes for the municipality of Oslo were counted the party had managed to gain three seats on the City Council, with Folkvord's position secure. At national level Red had received 1.9% and 2.1% for the municipal and county elections respectively. During the 2009 election several opinion polls showed that Folkvord and Dahle had enough support to earn two seats in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg and Kristin Halvorsen from the Red-Green Coalition were both highly negative towards the idea of having Red in parliament. Folkvord stated several times that he would demand an immediate withdrawal of Norwegian troops from Afghanistan if elected to parliament. He said this decision involved both the \\"enthusiastic warriors of the Progress Party\\" and \\"the disillusioned skeptics of the Socialist Left\\". Folkvord later felt he needed to set pressure on the Labour Party which would, according to him, move them further to the left. Labour Party member Reiulf Steen had reacted positively towards the idea of having Folkvord in parliament saying, \\"I am a great admirer of Erling Folkvord. He has integrity and great courage. Besides I am overjoyed that Red supports the Red-Green coalition\\". When the votes were counted Red had an increase of 1% from the 2005 election, but it was not enough to secure Folkvord a seat in parliament. When all the votes were counted the party had gained 1.3% of the national vote, an increase of 0.1%.  Political positions  2009 parliamentary election During an interview in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power so that they could better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, \\"It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [because many] fake socialist regimes have collapsed\\". Another opinion of his was that \\"capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway\\". Folkvord's first contact with anti- capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party taught him about \\"capitalist barbarism\\" and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that \\"[this] can't be the end of human development\\", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more- just system. Folkvord has long supported the Kurdish independence movement, believing that Norway and other countries in Europe should stop treating the conflicts between Turkish military and the Kurds as an internal Turkish matter. Being an anti-war activist he was highly vocal against Norwegian involvement in the War on Terror since the start of the American led invasion of Iraq. In 2009 Folkvord visited Norwegian soldiers in Afghanistan but claimed that Red was the only Norwegian party not allowed to visit the Afghan city of Meymaneh, the city were the Norwegian troops are stationed. He is also highly vocal against Norwegian membership in the European Union, claiming the organisation is spreading \\"German imperialism\\".  Authorship  Since earning the position of Oslo City Council representative in 1984, Folkvord has used much of his time writing books about his political experiences and beliefs. His books have earned much attention by the Norwegian media. He has also collaborated on several books, the most notable being Rapport fra rottereiret ‚Äì korrupsjon i Norge. In the book Folkvord claimed that Lise Harlem was involved in some sort of corruption in Norway, although to verify this he had only one source, Knut Frigaard. Harlem later wrote an article in Aftenposten stating that the book was \\"dubiously\\" written and unreliable. The book also received support from Carl August Fleischer and Liberal Party politician Helge Seip who defended the book against the accusations. Folkvord wrote R√∏dt! in 1998, a book about his tenure as a parliamentary representative. Twelve pages were about Folkvords four-year-term as representative, the other pages contained information criticising fellow parliamentary representatives. When writing the book, he wanted it to have some sort of impact on Red Youth members and other left of center groups or activists. Operasjon Heilomvending, published in 2007, contained a large amount of criticism of the Socialist Left Party, the Labour Party and the Red-Green Coalition in general. The book V√•r korrupte hovedstad (Our Corrupt Capital), was published in 2011. In 2015 his book [\\"the great Oslo robbery\\"] Det store Oslo-ranet was published.  Family  Folkvord has a daughter named Jorunn Folkvord who works as a teacher and is a member of the Norwegian teachers union, Union of Education Norway. She was notable for her far-left political activities in Norway, having membership status in the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance. She took part in several notable protests during the 1990s, in one case being arrested by the police. She was also the Leader of Red Youth during the early 1990s.

The village is situated about east of Uppingham, south of the A47 road which passes through the parish. In 2001, it had a population of 219, falling to 204 at the 2011 census. History Bisbrooke, England in 1673 Bisbrooke was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 then spelt \\"Bitlesbroch\\". Over the centuries the spelling has gone through as many as 19 name changes including Bitelesbroke, Pysbroke and Butlisbroke before the present spelling was adopted. At the time of the Norman survey, about half of the land was owned by the King and the rest by Countess Judith of Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire. Following the dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, in 1547 the land was granted by King Edward VI to Sir Richard Lee who soon afterwards settled it on Anthony Andrews. The land was still in the Andrews family nearly a century later with Bisbrooke or Pisbroke as it was then spelled, being owned by Anthony‚Äôs great, grandson Edward, Sheriff of Rutland. In the Civil War Edward initially supported the King but afterwards embraced the Parliamentarians‚Äô cause. Fined for his earlier Royalist tendencies, he seemed to have been unable to meet his debts and his land was sold. The Bisbrooke estate was acquired during the Commonwealth by Sir George Manners (father of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland) and so, most of Bisbrooke passed into the Duke of Rutland's Belvoir Estate. It was auctioned in 1918. Notable buildings The parish church of St John the Baptist dates from 1871 in its present form, though the tower was only finished in 1914. It was listed Grade II in 1955. There are a number of fine gravestones, which pre-date the present building. Samuel Thomas Bloomfield was vicar here from 1814 until his death in 1869 and chess player George Alcock MacDonnell was vicar, 1887-99.

Its role is to dampen loud sounds, such as those produced from chewing, shouting, or thunder. Because its reaction time is not fast enough, the muscle cannot protect against hearing damage caused by sudden loud sounds, like explosions or gunshots. Structure Insertion of the tensor tympani muscle onto the malleus. . AA‚Äô ( two fibrous collagenic layers); B √©pidermis; C mucous membrane; D head of malleus; E incus; F stapes; G tensor tympani; H lateral process of malleus; I Manubrium of malleus; J stapedius muscle. The tensor tympani is a muscle that is present in the middle ear. It arises from the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, and the adjacent great wing of the sphenoid. It then passes through its own canal, and ends in the tympanic cavity as a slim tendon that connects to the handle of the malleus. The tendon makes a sharp bend around the processus cochleariformis, part of the wall of its cavity, before it joins with the malleus. The tensor tympani receives blood from the middle meningeal artery via the superior tympanic branch. It is one of two muscles in the tympanic cavity, the other being the stapedius. =Nerve supply= The tensor tympani is supplied by the tensor tympani nerve, a branch of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. As the tensor tympani is supplied by motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve, it does not receive fibers from the trigeminal ganglion, which has sensory fibers only. =Development= The tensor tympani muscle develops from mesodermal tissue in the 1st pharyngeal arch. Function The tensor tympani acts to dampen the noise produced by chewing. When tensed, the muscle pulls the malleus medially, tensing the tympanic membrane and damping vibration in the ear ossicles and thereby reducing the perceived amplitude of sounds. It is one of the muscles involved in the acoustic reflex. =Voluntary control= Contracting muscles produce vibration and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions per second (equivalent to 10 to 30 Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70 Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound can be heard by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply. This phenomenon has been known since (at least) 1884.cf : Tillaux Paul Jules, Trait√© d‚ÄôAnatomie topographique avec applications √† la chirurgie, Paris Asselin et Houzeau publishers (4¬∞ed. 1884, p. 125 ) = Involuntary control (tympanic reflex) = The tympanic reflex helps prevent damage to the inner ear by muffling the transmission of vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window. The reflex has a response time of 40 milliseconds, not fast enough to protect the ear from sudden loud noises such as an explosion or gunshot. Examples of the onset and recovery of the acoustic reflex measured with a 350x350px Thus, the reflex most likely developed to protect early humans from loud thunder claps which do not happen in a split second. The reflex works by contracting the muscles of the middle ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius. This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as benzodiazepines had been known to cause tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat. Clinical significance In many people with hyperacusis, an increased activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear as part of the startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology). The mechanisms behind dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle and their consequences are hypotheses. However, in a published study, researchers studied the case of an acoustic shock whose mechanisms suggest dysfunction of the tympanic tensor muscle. This study appears to be the first to provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (e.g. tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with substances P and CGRP were found in close proximity.Londero A, Charpentier N, Ponsot D, Fournier P, Pezard L and Nore√±a AJ (2017) A Case of Acoustic Shock with Post-trauma Trigeminal-Autonomic Activation.

It is the administrative centre of the Lienz district, which covers all of East Tyrol. The municipality also includes the cadastral subdivision of Patriasdorf. Geography Lienz is located at the confluence of the rivers Isel and Drava in the Eastern Alps, between the Hohe Tauern mountain range in the north (including the Schober and Kreuzeck groups), and the Gailtal Alps in the south. It is connected with Winklern in Carinthia by the Iselsberg Pass. The neighbouring municipality of Leisach marks the easternmost point of the Puster Valley.

Celtic people lived here from about 300 BC on, mainly as miners, who came under control of the Roman Empire in 15 BC. The area was incorporated into the province of Noricum and Emperor Claudius had a municipium called Aguntum erected near Lienz in the today's municipality of D√∂lsach. Aguntum became the see of an Early Christian bishop in the 5th century but decayed during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps and the subsequent fights with the Bavarii under King Tassilo I about 600. Part of the Slavic principality of Carantania, the area passed under Bavarian and finally Frankish suzerainty during the 8th century. Bruck Castle Lienz itself was first mentioned as Luenzina in a deed issued by the Bishop of Brixen about 1030. The settlement itself, together with neighbouring Patriasdorf, then belonged of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, who were elevated to immediate landlords by Emperor Henry IV in 1077. It was then purchased by the scions of the Meinhardiner dynasty, who held the office of Aquileian V√∂gte (reeves) and chose Lienz as a residence. From about 1127 they called themselves Counts of G√∂rz (Gorizia). Located on the important trade route from Venzone in Friuli to Salzburg, the market town of Lienz received city rights on 25 February 1242. In 1278 the Counts finished Burg Bruck, a castle that until 1500 served as their local seat. When the Meinhardiner became extinct in 1500 upon the death of Count Leonhard of Gorizia, their estates were bequeathed to the Habsburg King Maximilian I and finally incorporated into the County of Tyrol. From the status of an Imperial residence, Lienz sank to the insignificance of a provincial town within the Habsburg Monarchy. Pfarrbr√ºcke bridge During the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, Lienz was occupied twice by French troops in 1797. After the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz, Lienz with Tyrol passed to the Electorate of Bavaria according to the 1805 Peace of Pressburg. In 1809 it became the administrative centre of a district within the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces, but was reconquered by Austrian troops in 1813. Until 1918, the town was again part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Tyrol province. In November 1918 it was occupied by the Italian Army. After World War I the southern parts of the former Cisleithanian crown land of Tyrol (i.e. Trentino and South Tyrol) were awarded to the Kingdom of Italy under the terms of the London Pact and the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, making the Lienz district of East Tyrol an exclave with no territorial connection to the mainland of North Tyrol. After the 1938 Anschluss of the Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany, the Lienz district became a part of the \\"Reichsgau\\" of Carinthia. On 8 May 1945 British forces occupied Lienz, which together with Carinthia and Styria became part of the British occupation zone. At this time several thousand members of the former Wehrmacht 1st Cossack Division coming from Yugoslavia had arrived in and around Lienz. They surrendered to the British troops but were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.

It is a satire of several theatrical, literary and film genres, including Victorian melodrama, farce, the penny dreadful, Wuthering Heights and the Alfred Hitchcock film Rebecca (1940). The title is the name of a character in the 1915 French movie serial Les Vampires and is an anagram for the word \\"vampire.\\" Background The play is written for two actors who, between them, play eight characters of both sexes. In order to ensure cross-dressing, licenses to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex.

Lady Enid is Lord Edgar's second wife, though he has yet to recover entirely from the passing of his first wife, Irma Vep. The house staff, a maid named Jane Twisden and a swineherd named Nicodemus Underwood, have their own opinions of Lady Enid. Enid is attacked by a vampire, and Edgar seeks answers in an Egyptian tomb, briefly resurrecting the mummy of an Egyptian princess. Returning home with the sarcophagus, Edgar prepares to hunt down the werewolf he blames for the death of his son and first wife. Meanwhile, Enid discovers Irma locked away, supposedly to coax out the location of precious jewels from her. Wresting the keys to Irma's cell from Jane, Enid frees Irma only to discover the prisoner is, in fact, Jane herself, actually a vampire, and the killer of Irma as well as her and Edgar's son. Nicodemus, now a werewolf, kills Jane, only to be shot dead by Edgar. In the end, Enid prevents Edgar from writing about his experiences in Egypt, revealing she was the princess herself, the whole thing an elaborate sham by her father to discredit Edgar.

It was first described by Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril in 1854. The adult eastern brown snake is up to 2 m (7 ft) long with a slender build. Its variable upper parts can be several shades of brown, ranging from pale brown to almost black, while its underside is pale cream-yellow, often with orange or grey splotches. The eastern brown snake is found in most habitats except dense forests. It has become more common in farmland and on the outskirts of urban areas, benefiting from agriculture due to the increased numbers of its main prey, the introduced house mouse. The species is oviparous. The snake is considered to be a least- concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though its status in New Guinea is not well known. Considered the world's second-most venomous land snake after the inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus), based on its value (subcutaneous) in mice, it is responsible for about 60% of snake-bite deaths in Australia. Its venom's main effects are on the circulatory system‚Äîcoagulopathy, haemorrhage (bleeding), cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest. One of the main components of the venom is the prothrombinase complex pseutarin-C, which breaks down prothrombin. Taxonomy John White, the surgeon-general of the First Fleet to New South Wales, wrote A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales in 1790, which described many Australian animal species for the first time. In it, he reported a snake that fit the description of the eastern brown snake, but did not name it. French zoologist Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril was the first to describe the species in 1854. He gave it the binomial name Furina textilis‚Äîin French furine tricot√©e (knitted furin)‚Äîfrom a specimen collected in October 1846 by Jules Verreaux, remarking that the fine-meshed pattern on the snake's body reminded him of fine stockings, which was the inspiration for the name. Due to differences in appearance, different specimens of the eastern brown snake were categorized as different species in the early 19th century. German herpetologist Johann Gustav Fischer described it as Pseudoelaps superciliosus in 1856, from a specimen collected from Sydney. German-British zoologist Albert G√ºnther described the species as Demansia annulata in 1858. Italian naturalist Giorgio Jan named Pseudoelaps sordellii and Pseudoelaps kubingii in 1859. Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum, reclassified Dum√©ril's species in the genus Pseudonaia [sic] in 1862 after collecting multiple specimens and establishing that the markings of young snakes faded as they grew into adult brown snakes. He concluded the original description was based on an immature specimen and sent an adult to G√ºnther, who catalogued it under the new name the same year when cataloguing new species of snakes in the British Museum's collection. After examining all specimens, G√ºnther concluded that Furina textilis and Diemansia annulata were named for young specimens and Pseudoelaps superciliosus, P. sordelli, and P. kubingii were named for adults, and all represented the same species, which he called Diemenia superciliosa. Belgian-British naturalist George Albert Boulenger called it Diemenia textilis in 1896, acknowledging Dum√©ril's name as having priority. In subsequent literature, it was known as Demansia textilis as Diemenia was regarded as an alternate spelling of Demansia. The brown snakes were moved from Diemenia/Demansia to Pseudonaja by Australian naturalist Eric Worrell in 1961 on the basis of skull morphology, and upheld by American herpetologist Samuel Booker McDowell in 1967 on the basis of the muscles of the venom glands. This classification has been followed by subsequent authors. In 2002, Australian herpetologist Richard W. Wells split the genus Pseudonaja, placing the eastern brown snake in the new genus Euprepiosoma, though this has not been recognized by other authors, and Wells has been strongly criticized for a lack of rigour in his research. Within the genus Pseudonaja, the eastern brown snake has the largest number of diploid chromosomes at 38; those of the other species range from 30 to 36. A 2008 study of mitochondrial DNA across its range showed three broad lineages: a southeastern clade from South Australia, Victoria, and southeastern and coastal New South Wales; a northeastern clade from northern and western New South Wales and Queensland; and a central (and presumably northern) Australian clade from the Northern Territory. The central Australian clade had colonised the region around Merauke in southern West Papua, and the northeastern clade had colonised Milne Bay, Oro, and Central Provinces in eastern Papua New Guinea in the Pleistocene via landbridges between Australia and New Guinea. P. textilis is monotypic. Raymond Hoser described all New Guinea populations as Pseudonaja textilis pughi based on a differing maxillary tooth count from Australian populations; this difference was inconsistent and, as no single New Guinea population is genetically distinct, the taxon is not recognised. Wells and C. Ross Wellington described Pseudonaja ohnoi in 1985 from a large specimen from Mount Gillen near Alice Springs, distinguishing it on the basis of scale numbers, but it is not regarded as distinct. The species is commonly called the eastern brown snake or common brown snake. It was known as marragawan to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. To the Dharawal of the Illawarra, it is goobalaang. The Dharawal and Awabakal held ceremonies for the eastern brown snake. Warralang is the reconstructed name in the Wiradjuri language of southern New South Wales. Description Juvenile, showing bands and black nape The eastern brown snake is of slender to average build with no demarcation between its head and neck. Its snout appears rounded when viewed from above. Most specimens have a total length (including tail) up to , with some large individuals reaching . The maximum recorded size for the species is . Evidence indicates that snakes from the northern populations tend to be larger than those from southern populations. The adult eastern brown snake is variable in colour. Its upper parts range from pale to dark brown, or sometimes shades of orange or russet, with the pigment more richly coloured in the posterior part of the dorsal scales. Eastern brown snakes from Merauke have tan to olive upper parts, while those from eastern Papua New Guinea are very dark grey-brown to blackish. The eastern brown snake's fangs are small compared to those of other Australian venomous snakes, averaging 2.8 mm in length or up to 4 mm in larger specimens. They are 1.1 cm apart. The tongue is dark, and the irises are blackish with a paler yellow-brown or orange ring around the pupil. The snake's chin and under parts are cream or pale yellow, sometimes fading to brown or grey-brown towards the tail. Often, orange, brown, or dark grey blotches occur on the under parts, more prominent anteriorly. The ventral scales are often edged with dark brown on their posterior edges. Juveniles can vary in markings, but generally have a black head, with a lighter brown snout and band behind, and a black nuchal band. Their bodies can be uniform brown, or have many black bands, or a reticulated pattern, with all darker markings fading with age. Snake clutches in colder areas tend have a higher proportion of young snakes with banded markings on their bodies. Its yellowish under parts serve to distinguish it from the dugite (Pseudonaja affinis) and peninsula brown snake (P. inframacula), which are entirely brown or brown with grey under parts. The eastern brown snake has flesh-pink skin inside its mouth, whereas the northern brown snake and western brown snake have black skin. Large eastern brown snakes are often confused with mulga snakes (Pseudechis australis), whose habitat they share in many areas, but may be distinguished by their smaller heads. Juvenile eastern brown snakes have head markings similar to red-naped snakes (Furina diadema), grey snakes (Hemiaspis damelii), Dwyer's snakes (Suta dwyeri), and the curl snake (Suta suta). =Scalation= The number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The eastern brown snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 192 to 231 ventral scales, 45 to 75 divided subcaudal scales (occasionally some of the anterior ones are undivided), and a divided anal scale. Its mouth is lined with six supralabial scales above and seven (rarely eight) sublabial scales below. Its nasal scale is almost always undivided, and rarely partly divided. Its eyes have two or rarely three postocular scales. Distribution and habitat The eastern brown snake is found along the east coast of Australia, from Malanda in far north Queensland, along the coasts and inland ranges of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and to the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Disjunct populations occur on the Barkly Tableland and the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory. and the far east of the Kimberley in Western Australia, and discontinuously in parts of New Guinea, specifically northern Milne Bay Province and Central Province in Papua New Guinea, and the Merauke region of Papua Province, in the Indonesian part of New Guinea. It is common in southeastern Queensland between Ipswich and Beenleigh. The eastern brown snake occupies a varied range of habitats from dry sclerophyll forests (eucalypt forests) and heaths of coastal ranges, through to savannah woodlands, inner grasslands, and arid scrublands and farmland, as well as drier areas that are intermittently flooded. It is more common in open habitat and also farmland and the outskirts of urban areas. It is not found in rainforests or other wet areas. Because of their mainly rodent diet, they can often be found near houses and farms. Such areas also provide shelter in the form of rubbish and other cover; the snakes use sheets of corrugated iron or buildings as hiding spots, as well as large rocks, burrows, and cracks in the ground. Behaviour Closeup of head The eastern brown snake is generally solitary, with females and younger males avoiding adult males. It is active during the day, though it may retire in the heat of hot days to come out again in the late afternoon. It is most active in spring, the males venturing out earlier in the season than females, and is sometimes active on warm winter days. Individuals have been recorded basking on days with temperatures as low as . Occasional nocturnal activity has been reported. At night, it retires to a crack in the soil or burrow that has been used by a house mouse, or (less commonly) skink, rat, or rabbit. Snakes may use the refuge for a few days before moving on, and may remain above ground during hot summer nights. During winter, they hibernate, emerging on warm days to sunbathe. Fieldwork in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area found that snakes spent on average 140 days in a burrow over winter, and that most males had entered hibernation by the beginning of May (autumn) while females did not begin till mid-May; the males mostly became active in the first week in September (spring), while the females not until the end of the month. The concrete slabs of houses have been used by eastern brown snakes hibernating in winter, with 13 recorded coiled up together under a 5m by 3m slab of a demolished house between Mount Druitt and Rooty Hill in western Sydney, and another 17 (in groups of one to four) under smaller slabs within 20 m in late autumn 1972. Groups of up to six hibernating eastern brown snakes have been recorded from under other slabs in the area. In July 1991 in Melton, six eastern brown snakes were uncovered in a nest in long grass. Eastern brown snakes are very fast moving snakes, Australian naturalist David Fleay reported it could outpace a person running at full speed. Many people mistake defensive displays for aggression. When confronted, the eastern brown snake reacts with one of two neck displays. During a partial display, the snake raises the front part of its body horizontally just off the ground, flattening its neck and sometimes opening its mouth. In a full display, the snake rises up vertically high off the ground, coiling its neck into an S shape, and opening its mouth. The snake is able to strike more accurately from a full display and more likely to deliver an envenomed bite. Due to the snake's height off the ground in full display, the resulting bites are often on the victim's upper thigh. A field study in farmland around Leeton that monitored 455 encounters between eastern brown snakes and people found that the snake withdrew around half the time and tried to hide for almost all remaining encounters. In only twelve encounters did the snake advance. They noted that snakes were more likely to notice dark clothing and move away early, reducing the chance of a close encounter. Close encounters were more likely if a person were walking slowly, but a snake was less likely to be aggressive in this situation. Encountering male snakes on windy days with cloud cover heightened risk, as the snake was less likely to see persons until they were close, hence more likely to be startled. Similarly, walking in undisturbed areas on cool days in September and October risked running into courting male snakes that would not notice people until close as they were preoccupied with mating. =Reproduction= Eastern brown snakes generally mate from early October onwards‚Äîduring the Southern Hemisphere spring; they are oviparous. Males engage in ritual combat with other males for access to females. The appearance of two males wrestling has been likened to a pleated rope. The most dominant male will mate with females in the area. The females produce a clutch of 10 to 35 eggs, with the eggs typically weighing each. The eggs are laid in a sheltered spot, such as a burrow or hollow inside a tree stump or rotting log. Multiple females may even use the same location, such as a rabbit warren. Ambient temperature influences the rate at which eggs develop; eggs incubated at hatch after 95 days, while those at hatch after 36 days. Eastern brown snakes can reach sexual maturity by 31 months of age, and have been reported to live up to 15 years in captivity. =Feeding= Holding its head up like a periscope looking for prey The eastern brown snake appears to hunt by sight more than other snakes, and a foraging snake raises its head like a periscope every so often to survey the landscape for prey. It generally finds its food sources in their refuges rather than chasing fleeing prey. The adult is generally diurnal, while juveniles sometimes hunt at night. The eastern brown snake rarely eats during winter, and females rarely eat while pregnant with eggs. The eastern brown snake has been observed coiling around and constricting prey to immobilise and subdue it, adopting a strategy of poisoning and grappling their prey. Herpetologists Richard Shine and Terry Schwaner proposed that it might be resorting to constriction when attacking skinks as it might facilitate piercing the skink's thick scales with its small fangs. Constricting its prey, a blue-tongue lizard The eastern brown snake's diet is made up almost wholly of vertebrates, with mammals predominating‚Äîparticularly the introduced house mouse. Mammals as large as feral rabbits have been eaten. Small birds, eggs, and even other snakes are also consumed. Snakes in areas of natural vegetation or paddocks for stock eat a higher proportion of reptiles, while those in crop fields eat more mice. Small lizards such as skinks are more commonly eaten than frogs, as eastern brown snakes generally forage in areas over 100 m (350 ft) distant from water. Snakes larger than from snout to vent eat predominantly warm-blooded prey, while smaller snakes mainly eat ectothermic animals. Other snakes, such as the common death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus), and carpet python (Morelia spilota), have also been eaten. Cannibalism has also been recorded in young snakes. The bearded dragon is possibly resistant to the effects of the venom. Although the eastern brown snake is susceptible to cane toad toxins, young individuals avoid eating them, which suggests they have learned to avoid them. Some evidence indicates they are immune to their own venom and that of the mulga snake (Pseudechis australis), a potential predator. Venom The eastern brown snake is considered the second-most venomous terrestrial snake in the world, behind only the inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) of central east Australia.The Australian venom research unit (11 January 2014). Facts and Figures: World's Most Venomous Snakes (archived). University of Melbourne. Retrieved 14 July 2014. Responsible for more deaths from snakebite in Australia than any other species, it is the most commonly encountered dangerous snake in Adelaide, and is also found in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, and Brisbane. As a genus, brown snakes were responsible for 41% of identified snakebite victims in Australia between 2005 and 2015, and for 15 of the 19 deaths during this period. Within the genus, the eastern brown snake is the species most commonly implicated. It is classified as a snake of medical importance by the World Health Organization. Dangerous snake poster published by Museum Victoria in 1877 Clinically, the venom of the eastern brown snake causes venom-induced consumption coagulopathy; a third of cases develop serious systemic envenoming including hypotension and collapse, thrombotic microangiopathy, severe haemorrhage, and cardiac arrest. Other common systemic symptoms include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis (sweating), and abdominal pain. Acute kidney injury and seizures can also occur. Onset of symptoms can be rapid, with a headache developing in 15 minutes and clotting abnormalities within 30 minutes; collapse has been recorded as occurring as little as two minutes after being bitten. Death is due to cardiovascular causes such as cardiac arrest or intracranial haemorrhage. Often, little local reaction occurs at the site of the bite. The classical appearance is of two fangmarks around 1 cm apart. Neurotoxicity is rare and generally mild, and myotoxicity (rhabdomyolysis) has not been reported. The eastern brown snake yields an average of under 5 mg of venom per milking, less than other dangerous Australian snakes. The volume of venom produced is largely dependent on the size of the snake, larger snakes producing more venom; Queensland eastern brown snakes produced over triple the average amount of venom (11 mg vs 3 mg) than those from South Australia. Worrell reported a milking of 41.4 mg from a relatively large 2.1-m (6.9-ft) specimen. The venom has a murine median lethal dose () has been measured at 41 Œºg/kg‚Äîwhen using 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline rather than saline alone‚Äîto 53 Œºg/kg when administered subcutaneously. The composition of venom of captive snakes did not differ from that of wild snakes. The eastern brown snake's venom contains coagulation factors VF5a and VF10, which together form the prothrombinase complex pseutarin-C. This cleaves prothrombin at two sites, converting it to thrombin. Pseutarin-C is a procoagulant in the laboratory, but ultimately an anticoagulant in snakebite victims, as the prothrombin is used up and coagulopathy and spontaneous bleeding set in. Another agent, textilinin, is a Kunitz-like serine protease inhibitor that selectively and reversibly inhibits plasmin. A 2006 study comparing the venom components of eastern brown snakes from Queensland with those from South Australia found that the former had a stronger procoagulant effect and greater antiplasmin activity of textilinin. The venom also contains pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins; textilotoxin is a presynaptic neurotoxin, at one stage considered the most potent recovered from any land snake. Making up 3% of the crude venom by weight, it is composed of six subunits. Existing in two forms, the venom weighs 83,770 ¬± 22 daltons (TxI) and about 87,000 daltons (TxII), respectively. Textilitoxin is a type of phospholipase A2, a group of enzymes with diverse effects that are commonly found in snake venoms. At least two further phospholipase A2 enzymes have been found in eastern brown snake venom. Two postsynaptic neurotoxins have been labelled pseudonajatoxin a and pseudonajatoxin b. These are three-finger toxins, a superfamily of proteins found in the venom of many elapid snakes and responsible for neurotoxic effects. Another three-finger toxin was identified in eastern brown snake venom in 2015. Professor Bart Currie coined the term ‚Äòbrown snake paradox' in 2000 to query why neurotoxic effects were rare or mild despite the presence of textilitoxin in eastern brown snake venom. This is thought to be due to the low concentration of the toxin in the venom, which is injected in only small amounts compared with other snake species. Analysis of venom in 2016 found‚Äîunlike most other snake species‚Äîthat the venom of juvenile eastern brown snakes differed from that of adults; prothrombinases (found in adults) were absent and the venom did not affect clotting times. Snakes found with a similar profile generally preyed upon dormant animals such as skinks. The eastern brown snake is the second-most commonly reported species responsible for envenoming of dogs in New South Wales. Dogs and cats are much more likely than people to have neurotoxic symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. One dog bitten suffered a massive haemorrhage of the respiratory tract requiring euthanasia. The venom is uniformly toxic to warm-blooded vertebrates, yet reptile species differ markedly in their susceptibility. =Treatment= Standard first-aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake is for a pressure bandage to the bite site. The victims should move as little as possible, and to be conveyed to a hospital or clinic, where they should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Tetanus toxoid is given, though the mainstay of treatment is the administration of the appropriate antivenom. Brown snake antivenom has been available since 1956. Before this, tiger snake antivenom was used, though it was of negligible benefit in brown snake envenoming. The antivenom had been difficult to research and manufacture as the species was hard to catch, and the amount of venom it produced was generally insufficient for horse immunization, though these challenges were eventually overcome. Dogs and cats can be treated with a caprylic acid-fractionated, bivalent, whole IgG, equine antivenom. Captivity Eastern brown snakes are readily available in Australia via breeding in captivity. They are regarded as challenging to keep, and due to the snakes' speed and toxicity, suitable for only experienced snake keepers.

Life and influence Karl was born in the Free Imperial City of Rothenburg, which is now called Rothenburg ob der Tauber in Germany. From 1814 he studied in Gymnasium in Ausbach. He attended the University of G√∂ttingen from 1818 to 1822 where he studied with Gauss who was director of the observatory. Staudt provided an ephemeris for the orbits of Mars and the asteroid Pallas. When in 1821 Comet Nicollet-Pons was observed, he provided the elements of its orbit. These accomplishments in astronomy earned him his doctorate from University of Erlangen in 1822. Staudt's professional career began as a secondary school instructor in W√ºrzburg until 1827 and then Nuremberg until 1835. He married Jeanette Dreschler in 1832. They had a son Eduard and daughter Mathilda, but Jeanette died in 1848. The book Geometrie der Lage (1847) was a landmark in projective geometry. As Burau (1976) wrote: :Staudt was the first to adopt a fully rigorous approach. Without exception his predecessors still spoke of distances, perpendiculars, angles and other entities that play no role in projective geometry.Walter Burau (1976) \\"Karl Georg Christian von Staudt\\", Dictionary of Scientific Biography, auspices of American Council of Learned Societies Furthermore, this book (page 43) uses the complete quadrangle to \\"construct the fourth harmonic associated with three points on a straight line\\", the projective harmonic conjugate. Indeed, in 1889 Mario Pieri translated von Staudt, before writing his I Principii della Geometrie di Posizione Composti in un Systema Logico-deduttivo (1898). In 1900 Charlotte Scott of Bryn Mawr College paraphrased much of von Staudt's work in English for The Mathematical Gazette.Charlotte Scott (1900) \\"On von Staudt's Geometrie der Lage\\", The Mathematical Gazette 1(19):307‚Äì14, 1(20):323‚Äì31, 1(22):363‚Äì70 When Wilhelm Blaschke published his textbook Projective Geometry in 1948, a portrait of the young Karl was placed opposite the Vorwort. Staudt went beyond real projective geometry and into complex projective space in his three volumes of Beitr√§ge zur Geometrie der Lage published from 1856 to 1860. In 1922 H. F. Baker wrote of von Staudt's work: :It was von Staudt to whom the elimination of the ideas of distance and congruence was a conscious aim, if, also, the recognition of the importance of this might have been much delayed save for the work of Cayley and Klein upon the projective theory of distance. Generalised, and combined with the subsequent Dissertation of Riemann, v. Staudt's volumes must be held to be the foundation of what, on its geometrical side, the Theory of Relativity, in Physics, may yet become.H. F. Baker (1922) Principles of Geometry, volume 1, page176, Cambridge University Press Von Staudt is also remembered for his view of conic sections and the relation of pole and polar: :Von Staudt made the important discovery that the relation which a conic establishes between poles and polars is really more fundamental than the conic itself, and can be set up independently. This \\"polarity\\" can then be used to define the conic, in a manner that is perfectly symmetrical and immediately self-dual: a conic is simply the locus of points which lie on their polars, or the envelope of lines which pass through their poles. Von Staudt‚Äôs treatment of quadrics is analogous, in three dimensions.H.S.M. Coxeter (1942) Non-Euclidean Geometry, pp 48,9, University of Toronto Press Algebra of throws In 1857, in the second Beitr√§ge, von Staudt contributed a route to number through geometry called the algebra of throws (). It is based on projective range and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Through operations of addition of points and multiplication of points, one obtains an \\"algebra of points\\", as in chapter 6 of Veblen & Young's textbook on projective geometry. The usual presentation relies on cross ratio (CA,BD) of four collinear points. For instance, Coolidge wrote:J. L. Coolidge (1940) A History of Geometrical Methods, pages 100, 101, Oxford University Press :How do we add two distances together? We give them the same starting point, find the point midway between their terminal points, that is to say, the harmonic conjugate of infinity with regard to their terminal points, and then find the harmonic conjugate of the initial point with regard to this mid-point and infinity. Generalizing this, if we wish to add throws (CA,BD) and (CA,BD' ), we find M the harmonic conjugate of C with regard to D and D' , and then S the harmonic conjugate of A with regard to C and M : ::(CA,BD) + (CA,BD') = (CA,BS) .\\\\ :In the same way we may find a definition of the product of two throws. As the product of two numbers bears the same ratio to one of them as the other bears to unity, the ratio of two numbers is the cross ratio which they as a pair bear to infinity and zero, so Von Staudt, in the previous notation, defines the product of two throws by ::(CA,BD) \\\\cdot (CA,DD') = (CA,BD'). :These definitions involve a long series of steps to show that the algebra so defined obeys the usual commutative, associative, and distributive laws, and that there are no divisors of zero. A summary statement is given by Veblen & YoungVeblen & Young page 141 as Theorem 10: \\"The set of points on a line, with P_\\\\infin removed, forms a field with respect to the operations previously defined\\". As Freudenthal notes :...up to Hilbert, there is no other example for such a direct derivation of the algebraic laws from geometric axioms as found in von Staudt's Beitr√§ge. Another affirmation of von Staudt's work with the harmonic conjugates comes in the form of a theorem: :The only one-to-one correspondence between the real points on a line which preserves the harmonic relation between four points is a non-singular projectivity.Dirk Struik (1953) Lectures on Analytic and Projective Geometry, p 22, \\"theorem of von Staudt\\" The algebra of throws was described as \\"projective arithmetic\\" in The Four Pillars of Geometry (2005).John Stillwell, Sheldon Axler, Ken A. Ribet (2005) The Four Pillars of Geometry, page 128, Springer: Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics In a section called \\"Projective arithmetic\\", he says :The real difficulty is that the construction of a + b , for example, is different from the construction of b + a, so it is a \\"coincidence\\" if a + b = b + a. Similarly it is a \\"coincidence\\" if ab = ba, of any other law of algebra holds. Fortunately, we can show that the required coincidences actually occur, because they are implied by certain geometric coincidences, namely the Pappus and Desargues theorems. If one interprets von Staudt‚Äôs work as a construction of the real numbers, then it is incomplete. One of the required properties is that a bounded sequence has a cluster point. As Hans Freudenthal observed: :To be able to consider von Staudt's approach as a rigorous foundation of projective geometry, one need only add explicitly the topological axioms which are tacitly used by von Staudt. ... how can one formulate the topology of projective space without the support of a metric? Von Staudt was still far from raising this question, which a quarter of a century later would become urgent. ... Felix Klein noticed the gap in von Staudt's approach; he was aware of the need to formulate the topology of projective space independently of Euclidean space.... the Italians were the first to find truly satisfactory solutions for the problem of a purely projective foundation of projective geometry, which von Staudt had tried to solve.Hans Freudenthal (1974) \\"The Impact of Von Staudt's Foundations of Geometry\\", in For Dirk Struik, R.S. Cohen editor, D. Reidel. Also found in Geometry ‚Äì von Staudt‚Äôs Point of View, Peter Plaumann & Karl Strambach editors, Proceedings of NATO Advanced Study Institute, Bad Windsheim, July/August 1980, D. Reidel, One of the Italian mathematicians was Giovanni Vailati who studied the circular order property of the real projective line. The science of this order requires a quaternary relation called the separation relation. Using this relation, the concepts of monotone sequence and limit can be addressed, in a cyclic \\"line\\". Assuming that every monotone sequence has a limit,H. S. M. Coxeter (1949) The Real Projective Plane, Chapter 10: Continuity, McGraw Hill the line becomes a complete space. These developments were inspired by von Staudt‚Äôs deductions of field axioms as an initiative in the derivation of properties of ‚Ñù from axioms in projective geometry.

Poljot Aviator caliber 3133 chronograph Founded in 1930 under orders from Joseph Stalin, the First State Watch Factory () was the first large scale Soviet watch and mechanical movement manufacturer. Via its USA-based trading company Amtorg, the Soviet government bought the defunct Ansonia Clock Company of Brooklyn, New York in 1929, and the Dueber-Hampden Watch Company of Canton, Ohio. It moved twenty-eight freight cars full of machinery and parts from the USA to Moscow in order to establish the factory. Twenty-one former Dueber- Hampden watchmakers, engravers and various other technicians helped to train the Russian workers in the art of watchmaking as part of the Soviet's first five-year plan. The movements of very-early products were still stamped \\"Dueber-Hampden, Canton, Ohio, USA\\" (examples of these watches are very collectible today). In 1935 the factory was named after the murdered Soviet official Sergei Kirov. As the Germans closed in on Moscow in 1941, the factory was hurriedly evacuated to Zlatoust (). By 1943 the Germans were in retreat, and the factory moved back to Moscow, adopting the \\"First Moscow Watch Factory\\" name (). In 1947 the first wristwatches under the brand name \\"Pobeda\\" and the first Marine Chronometers and Deck watches were produced. By 1951 the production of wristwatches had increased to 1.1 million. In 1975 new machinery and equipment for manufacturing complex watches was imported from Switzerland. The first chronograph \\"Okean\\" (caliber 3133) was produced for the space station \\"Sojuz-23.\\" In 1990 production of watches and clocks reached 5 million pieces, and in 1991 the international award \\"Golden Trophy for Quality\\" was awarded in Madrid. Sturmanskie (First Moscow Watch Factory), 1949. The stamp of Russia, 2010. Sturmanskie PMChZ watches in Space =Gagarin's flight= On 12 April 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space. The watch Gagarin wore was made by the First Moscow Watch Company under the name Sturmanskie, which translates to \\"Navigator's\\". Today's owner of the brand, Volmax (based in both Moscow and Switzerland), is the only authorized company allowed to use Gagarin's name and likeness in watch production. Gagarin received his 15-jewel watch with a manual-wind Poljot movement when he graduated from the Soviet air force flight school in 1957. The original watches were built exclusively for the Soviet Air Force and not available to the public. Publicly available versions of the model were not released until years later. At 33 mm in diameter, the original watch was small by today's standards. The watch performed flawlessly in space and is currently on display at the Moscow Museum of Cosmonautics. Commemorative editions produced today are 40 mm and have a 17-jewel Poljot movement.https://watchalfavit.ru/articles/chasy-dlya-kosmosa/ =First space walk= In 1965 cosmonaut Alexei Leonov wore an FMWF Strela (transliteration of –°–¢–†–ï–õ–ê, which actually means \\"Arrow\\") chronograph during his historic first space walk, thus cementing Poljot's place in space history. As with Gagarin's first flight, Leonov's watch was not specially commissioned. The Strela replaced the Shturmanskie as the standard issue pilots watch. In the late 1970s, the Strela itself was replaced by a new breed of chronographs based around the (then new) 3133 movement (an original Russian movement similar in functionality to the Swiss Valjoux 7734, but with higher number of jewels 23 vs 17 and lever movement operating at 21,600 bph vs 18,000 bph). Poljot 3133-based watches continued where their predecessors left off and were taken into space by cosmonauts from Russia, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the wrist of cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, a Poljot 3133-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history. Current status Chronograph Poljot \\"Blue Angels\\", caliber 3133. During the Soviet era, Soviet watch brands including Poljot, but also Raketa watches, were marketed in the United Kingdom under the brand \\"Sekonda\\". Today's Sekonda company, a British distributor of ubiquitous fashion watches, has no connection to any Russian watches. At the turn of the 21st century, the First Moscow Watch Factory began reproducing many of their most famous models as limited edition commemorative pieces. Replicas were made of the famous 1960s Shturmanskie worn by Yuri Gagarin, the 1940s Kirova pilots chronograph, and the 1970s Ocean () chronograph. All of the replicas became collectables. In late 2003, rumours predicting the demise of the Poljot brand circulated on the Internet. According to the rumours, the First Moscow Watch Factory was to cease producing their own models and become a source of inexpensive movements for other European watch brands. These rumours never came to fruition. Instead, in the late 2000s, the company was bought by the businessman Serge√Ø Pugachev, becoming one of the companies of his new luxury group, including: H√©diard, and the channel Luxe TV. The physical remnants of First Moscow Watch Factory were purchased by a group of former Poljot employees, forming the basis for a new company, Volmax. Volmax marketed watches under the Aviator, Buran and Shturmanskie brands using movements produced by another Russian firm, MakTime. As of 2012, the status of the Poljot brand is unclear, though the brand appears to be moribund. MakTime, the company utilizing old Poljot equipment to manufacture mechanical movements, went bankrupt,http://forums.watchuseek.com/f10/no-more-poljot-movements-654408.html and Volmax, the successor company to First Moscow Watch Factory relocated to Switzerland. Present models from the Volmax company are Swiss-made, using design cues from vintage Russian models.

History Night scene In 1600, Kuroda Nagamasa, a daimy≈ç of the Fukuoka-Han at that time, created Nakasu to connect between current Ch≈´≈ç-ku and Hakata-ku by building two bridges over the rivers at the sandbank: Higashi Nakajima Bridge and Nishi Nakajima Bridge (currently is Sh≈çwa Street). Present day of Nakasu has 18 bridges in total, 7 of them are built at the side of the Ch≈´≈ç-ku, and 11 at the side of the Hakata-ku. Once Nakasu was used to thrive with the Tamaya, a department store of long standing, and movie theatres, although the center of commerce has moved currently to the Tenjin and Daimy≈ç districts in Ch≈´≈ç-ku. After the establishment of a shopping complex, the Canal City Hakata at neighbouring Sumiyoshi district in 1996, the areas of Tenjin, Nakasu, and Hakata Station, all of which are located in the middle of the place between the Tenjin district and Canal City Hakata, were unified. The redevelopment of unification with adjacent Kawabata district is also in progress. On March 29, 2002, the Nakasu Special Investigators, a squad of the Fukuoka Prefectural Police, was formed and patrol to prevent crimes. A huge commercial complex, the \\"gate's\\" was opened in 2006, at the site the Tamaya was located. In Popular Culture *The 2012 video game Yakuza 5 features a fictional district called Nagasugai, based on Nakasu. This is where main series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu comes to start a new life as a taxi driver under the alias of Taichi Suzuki.

It is oriented towards children, youth and innovative television. History Initially the third Dutch public television channel would be a joint venture with the Flemish public broadcaster VRT (then called BRTN), which would specialize in a cooperative Netherlands/Flanders programming. With the pretended cooperation, BRT (now VRT) would either continue or terminate its second channel by operating it more lucratively. This plan failed but later resulted in a new television channel targeting Dutch and Flemish people living abroad. Two Dutch broadcasters, NPO and RNW, launched BVN as Zomer TV in 1996, and all of its programming originally came from the Netherlands (the abbreviation BVN at first standing for het Beste Van Nederland, \\"the best of the Netherlands\\"), this however changed, once the VRT began contributing both financially and delivering programmes, changing the channel from specializing in programming from the Netherlands to specializing in Dutch programming from the Netherlands and Flanders. NPO 3 was established as 'Nederland 3' on 4 April 1988, however the channel was used for experimental purposes for the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary earlier on in the year. Nederland 3 became the home channel of the broadcasters VPRO, VARA, RVU, and NPS, all of which share a progressive outlook. The initial emphasis was news, culture and sports. In September 2000, AVRO, BNN, EO, KRO and TROS later joined this channel in producing more content for its programming output. The channel focused on news, debate, culture and innovative television. Before the evening the channel's programming, under the label of Z@ppelin, was aimed at children. In September 2006, the programming of NPO's television channels changed slightly. Nederland 3 still focuses on children during the daytime. In the evenings it aims to reach an open-minded audience with innovative, educational television and occasionally sports. All Dutch public broadcasting organizations have air-time on Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3; youth-oriented broadcaster BNN broadcast only on Nederland 3. On 15 September 2007 the NPO channels Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3 switched completely to anamorphic widescreen, before that time some of the programming was already broadcast in widescreen. On 4 July 2009 all three channels began simulcasting in 1080i high-definition. Before the launch of the permanent HD service, a test version of the Nederland 1 HD channel was made available from 2 June 2008 until 24 August 2008 in order to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD. On 12 March 2013, the NPO announced that Nederland 1, 2 and 3 will be renamed as NPO 1, 2 and 3. The reason for this change is to make the channels and its programmes more recognizable. The rebranding completed on 19 August 2014. Programming Between 06:00 and 19:30 NPO Zapp and NPO Zappelin broadcast television oriented at children, this includes educational television, like SchoolTV from broadcaster NTR. After 19:30 the programming for youth and young adults starts, between 2005 and 2013 De Wereld Draait Door was broadcast at this time, but moved to NPO 1. The programming is filled with films, drama and comedy (both made by the public broadcasters and imported from foreign broadcasters), and successful programmes such as Top of the Pops, College Tour, De Lama's, Spuiten en Slikken and Raymann is Laat. It also broadcasts European Football such as the UEFA Champions League live until season 2015/2016 when it was moved to SBS 6.

One of the primary causes of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of specific protein phosphatases and is known to have a variety of negative effects on cells. A polyketide, polyether derivative of a C38 fatty acid, okadaic acid and other members of its family have shined light upon many biological processes both with respect to dinoflagellete polyketide synthesis as well as the role of protein phosphatases in cell growth.  History  As early as 1961, reports of gastrointestinal disorders following the consumption of cooked mussels appeared in both the Netherlands and Los Lagos. Attempts were made to determine the source of the symptoms, however they failed to elucidate the true culprit, instead implicating a species of microplanctonic dinoflagellates. In the summers of the late 1970s, a series of food poisoning outbreaks in Japan lead to the discovery of a new type of shellfish poisoning. Named for the most prominent symptoms, the new Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) only affected the northern portion of Honshu during 1976, however by 1977 large cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama were affected. Research into the shellfish consumed in the affected regions showed that a fat-soluble toxin was responsible for the 164 documented cases, and this toxin was traced to mussels and scallops harvested in the Miyagi prefecture. In northeastern Japan, a legend had existed that during the season of paulownia flowers, shellfish can be poisonous. Studies following this outbreak showed that toxicity of these mussels and scallops appeared and increased during the months of June and July, and all but disappeared between August and October. Elsewhere in Japan, in 1975 Fujisawa pharmaceutical company observed that the extract of a black sponge, Halichondria okadai, was a potent cytotoxin, and was dubbed Halichondrine-A. In 1981, the structure of one such toxin, okadaic acid, was determined after it was extracted from both the black sponge in Japan, Halichondria okadai, for which it was named, and a sponge in the Florida Keys, Halichondria melanodocia. Okadaic acid sparked research both for its cytotoxic feature and for being the first reported marine ionophore. One of the toxic culprits of DSP, dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), named for one of the organisms implicated in its production, Dinophysis fortii, was compared to and shown to be very chemically similar to okadaic acid several years later, and okadaic acid itself was implicated in DSP around the same time. Since its initial discovery, reports of DSP have spread throughout the world, and are especially concentrated in Japan, South America and Europe.  Synthesis  = Derivatives = Okadaic acid (OA) and its derivatives, the dinophysistoxins (DTX), are members of a group of molecules called polyketides. The complex structure of these molecules include multiple spiroketals, along with fused ether rings. Structures of Okadaic Acid and the Dinophysistoxins = Biosynthesis = Being polyketides, the okadaic acid family of molecules are synthesized by dinoflagellates via polyketide synthase (PKS). However unlike the majority of polyketides, the dinoflagellate group of polyketides undergo a variety of unusual modifications. Okadaic acid and its derivatives are some of the most well studied of these polyketides, and research on these molecules via isotopic labeling has helped to elucidate some of those modifications. Okadaic acid is formed from a starter unit of glycolate, found at carbons 37 and 38, and all subsequent carbons in the chain are derived from acetate. Because polyketide synthesis is similar to fatty acid synthesis, during chain extension the molecule may undergo reduction of the ketone, dehydration, and reduction of the olefin. Failure to perform one of more of these three steps, combined with several unusual reactions is what allows for the formation of the functionality of okadaic acid. Carbon deletion and addition at the alpha and beta position comprise the other transformations present in the okadaic acid biosynthesis. Carbon deletion occurs by way of a Favorskii rearrangement and subsequent decarboxylation. Attack of a ketone in the growing chain by enzyme-bound acetates, and subsequent decarboxylation/dehydration results in an olefin replacing the ketone, in both alpha and beta alkylation. After this the olefin can isomerize to more thermodynamically stable positions, or can be activated for cyclizations, in order to produce the natural product. = Laboratory Syntheses = Isobe's Synthesis of Okadaic Acid. To date, several studies have been performed toward the synthesis of okadaic acid and its derivatives. 3 total syntheses of okadaic acid have been achieved, along with many more formal syntheses and several total syntheses of the other dinophysistoxins. The first total synthesis of okadaic acid was completed in 1986 by Isobe et al., just 5 years after the molecule's structure was elucidated. The next two were completed in 1997 and 1998 by the Forsyth and Ley groups respectively. In Isobe's synthesis, the molecule was broken into 3 pieces, along the C14-C15 bonds, and the C27-C28 bonds. This formed fragments A, B, and C, which were all synthesized separately, after which the B and C fragments were combined, and then combined with the A fragment. This synthesis contained 106 steps, with a longest linear sequence of 54 steps. The precursors to all three fragments were all glucose derivatives obtained from the chiral pool. Spiroketals were obtained from precursor ketone diols, and were therefore formed thermally in acid. Forsyth's Synthesis of Okadaic Acid. Similar to Isobe's synthesis, the Forsyth synthesis sought to reduce the number of steps, and to increase potential for designing analogues late in the synthesis. To do this, Forsyth et al. designed the synthesis to allow for structural changes and installation of important functional groups before large pieces were joined. Their resulting synthesis was 3% yielding, with 26 steps in the longest linear sequence. As above, spiroketalization was performed thermodynamically with introduction of acid. Ley's Synthesis of Okadaic Acid. Ley's synthesis of okadaic acid is most unlike its predecessors, although it still contains similar motifs. Like the others, this synthesis divided okadaic acid into three components along the acyclic segments. However, designed to display new techniques developed in their group, Ley's synthesis included forming the spiroketals using (diphenylphosphineoxide)-tetrahydrofuran and (phenylsulfonyl)-tetrahydropyrans, allowing for more mild conditions. Similar to those above, a portion of the stereochemistry in the molecule was set by starting materials obtained from the chiral pool, in this case mannose.  Biology  = Mechanism of Action = Okadaic acid (OA) and its relatives are known to strongly inhibit protein phosphatases, specifically serine/threonine phosphatases. Furthermore, of the 4 such phosphatases, okadaic acid and its relatives specifically target protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), at the exclusion of the other two, with dissociation constants for the two proteins of 150 nM and 30 pM respectively. Because of this, this class of molecules has been used to study the action of these phosphatases in cells. Once OA binds to the phosphatase protein(s), it results in hyperphosphorylation of specific proteins within the afflicted cell, which in turn reduces control over sodium secretion and solute permeability of the cell. Affinity between okadaic acid and its derivatives and PP2A has been tested, and it was shown that the only derivative with a lower dissociation constant, and therefore higher affinity, was DTX1, which has been shown to be 1.6 times stronger. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining the toxicity of mixtures of different okadaic acid derivatices, inhibitory equivalency factors for the relatives of okadaic acid have been studied. In wild type PP2A, the inhibitory equivalency relative to okadaic acid were 0.9 for DTX-1 and 0.6 for DTX-2. = Toxicology = The main route of exposure to DSP from okadaic acid and its relatives is through the consumption of shellfish. It was initially shown that the toxic agents responsible for DSP tend to be most concentrated in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gills for certain shellfish. The symptoms for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning include intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pains, and rarely nausea and vomiting, and they tend to occur anytime between 30 minutes and at most 12 hours after consuming toxic shellfish. It has been estimated that it takes roughly 40 Œºg of okadaic acid to produce diarrhetic effects in adult humans. = Medical Uses = Because of its inhibitory effects in phosphatases, okadaic acid has shown promise in the world of medicine for numerous potential uses. During its initial discovery, okadaic acid, specifically the crude source extract, showed potent inhibition of cancer cells, and so initial interest in the family of molecules tended to center around that feature. However, it was shown that the more cytotoxic component of H. Okadai was actually a separate family of compounds, the Halichondrines, and as such research into the cytotoxicity of okadaic acid decreased. However, the unique function of okadaic acid upon cells maintained biological interest in the molecule. Okadaic acid has been shown to have neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and embryotoxic effects. Furthermore, in two-stage carcinogenesis of mouse skin, the molecule and its relatives have been shown to have tumor promoting effects. Because of this, the effects of okadaic acid on Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, and other human diseases have been studied.

The Saga was composed in Iceland during the 13th century. It exists in several manuscripts which vary from each other. There are many different versions and translations of the saga. S≈Çupecki, Leszek P. Facts and fancy in J√≥msv√≠kinga saga in The Fantastic in Old Norse/Icelandic Literature: Preprint Papers of the 13th International Saga Conference (Durham: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006) The saga At the time of writing, Wolin, also known as Willon, off the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, was not more than a typical market town of the 13th century. However, the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga tells the story of its founding, centuries earlier, as the famed J√≥msborg (Jomsborg) by the legendary Danish chieftain P√°lna-T√≥ki. J√≥msborg's name is composed of two elements: the Old Norse term borg, meaning a citadel, and the unidentified term, J√≥m. The J√≥msv√≠kinga saga is centered around the tensions between Haraldr Gormsson of Denmark, H√°kon Sigur√∞arson of Norway, and the J√≥msv√≠kings. The J√≥msv√≠kings challenged royal authority in the midst of a power struggle between Denmark and Norway. In order to better understand the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga, it is important to understand the relationship between Denmark and Norway around this time. In addition to founding J√≥msborg, P√°lna-T√≥ki founded the brotherhood of J√≥msv√≠kings. The saga describes the brotherhood and the laws of the J√≥msv√≠kings (Jomsvikings). It also mentions their defeat during the semi-legendary naval Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr in 986. This battle occurred between the Jarls of Lade and the Danish invasion fleet of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark. J√≥msv√≠king chieftain, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, led the J√≥msv√≠kings in an effort to depose Jarl H√°kon Sigur√∞arson, vassal ruler of Norway. The J√≥msv√≠kings lived monastically and primarily in the Baltic region. The only things that are proven to have existed that were mentioned in the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga are many of the main characters (excluding P√°lna-T√≥ki), the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr, and the existence of J√≥msborg. Aside from those things, the rest is an unsolved mystery. History There are five versions of the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga that have been recovered over the years. The first, MS AM.291, is an incomplete manuscript written by an Icelander in the late thirteenth century. The second, MS AM. 510 4to, was written in the fifteenth century and contains much more information than the other versions. The third, Codex Holmanius 7, written in the fourteenth century, is shorter than the other versions and gives a brief summary of the saga. The fourth, Flateyjarb√≥k, is a combination of the J√≥msv√≠king saga and the Greater saga of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason. Lastly, the fifth version, was a Latin translation of Arngr√≠mr J√≥nsson written in the year 1592. Historians have found it difficult to classify the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga among the Old Norse sagas. It is sometimes counted among the Kings' sagas based principally upon the association with Danish kings. Both the Kings' sagas and the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga can be looked at through a political lens.

Arnell composed in all the established genres for the concert stage, and his list of works includes six completed symphonies (a seventh was realised by Martin Yates) and six string quartets.English Music Festival: Composer profiles . Accessed 27 April 2013 At the Trinity College of Music, he \\"promoted a pioneering interest in film scores and electronic music\\" and jazz. Life and career Arnell was born in Hampstead, London, the son of H√©l√®ne Marie (Scherf) and Richard Sayer Arnell. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1935 to 1939, and was taught there by John Ireland (composition) and St John Dykes (piano). He was awarded the Farrar Prize for composition during his final year at the college. At the outset of the Second World War, attending the New York World Fair, Arnell (along with other English composers, e.g. Arthur Bliss) was stranded in New York, and stayed on until 1947, thereby finding himself in the position of having an established reputation in the US, but remaining relatively little known in his homeland. During his American sojourn, Arnell was the Music Supervisor for the BBC in North America, and was commissioned to compose (to a text by Stephen Spender) a cantata, The War God, in celebration of the opening of the United Nations, as well as a fanfare to greet Winston Churchill's arrival in New York. His music has been championed by Thomas Beecham, Leopold Stokowski and Bernard Herrmann, among others and more recently by Warren Cohen and Martin Yates (one of his composition students at Trinity).Yates continues as of 2015 to champion his music; see e.g. this description of a late May 2015 concert with works by Arnell, Havergal Brian, and others. With the exception of a break from 1967 to 1970 to act as Visiting Fulbright Professor at Bowdoin College, Maine, from 1967 to 1968 (in an exchange with Elliott Schwartz), and at Hofstra University, New York, from 1968 to 1970, he taught at Trinity College of Music in London between 1947 and 1987, where his students included Peter Tahourdin (1949‚Äì52), electronic composer David Hewson, who worked with him on films including Dilemma (1981), Doctor in the Sky (1984), Toulouse- Lautrec (1986), and The Light of the World (1989), was one of his pupils.Richard Arnell obituary Richard Arnell: Unjustly neglected composer who has found a new audience through recent recordings by Lewis Foreman 9 May 2009 Independent UK Arnell composed the music for The Land (1942), a 45-minute documentary film directed by Robert J. Flaherty for the US Department of Agriculture. He was also commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to compose a symphonic suite inspired by the workers in the factory at Dagenham. The resulting work accompanies a film entitled Opus 65. Arnell established and headed the Music Department at the London International Film School until his retirement in the late 1980s. Mention must also be made of Arnell's extraordinary support and concern for a large number of musicians and artists both young and old as can be seen in his friendship and support for the painter, Mark Rothko. He was also known for his major works for the ballet as can be seen in his collaborations with choreographers of the stature of George Balanchine, John Cranko and Frederick Ashton. His many ballets have been successfully staged in both New York and London. His score for Punch and the Child was recorded by Sir Thomas Beecham with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, a recording which has seldom been out of the catalogue. All seven of Arnell's numbered symphonies together with the Sinfonia Quasi Variazioni, the Piano Concerto (soloist David Owen Norris), the two Violin Concertos (soloist Lorraine MacAslan), Lord Byron: a Symphonic Portrait, Robert Flaherty Impression, Prelude The Black Mountain and the early Overture The New Age, received their world premiere recordings by conductor Martin Yates and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra between 2005 and 2008. The premiere recordings of the ballets The Angels, Harlequin in April and The Great Detective, together with Punch and the Child, were recorded by Martin Yates and the BBC Concert Orchestra in 2008‚Äì09. Arnell had left sketches for a Seventh Symphony, dedicated to Nelson Mandela, at the time of his death, and it has since been realised and completed by Martin Yates. It was recorded in the summer of 2010 by Yates and the RSNO and was issued by Dutton Epoch. The String Quartets have recently been released on the Dutton Epoch label played by the Tippett Quartet.

It makes the Foveon X3 sensor, which captures images in some digital cameras. Foveon was founded in 1997 and is based in Santa Clara, California. In 2008 it was bought by Sigma Corporation. Details The company, founded in 1997 by Carver Mead, Richard Lyon, Richard B. Merrill, Richard Turner, Richard Nedwich, and others, was a spin-off of National Semiconductor and Synaptics. The founding directors were: Federico Faggin (president and CEO of Synaptics), Brian Halla (chairman, president/CEO of National Semiconductor), and Dick Sanquini (VP of National Semiconductor). It is based in Santa Clara, California. Foveon was initially known for their high-end digital portrait camera systems built around a color-separation beam- splitter prism assembly. Later, the X3 pixel sensor became the company's main product. Both the prism system and the X3 technology derive their benefit from using all the light and sensing all colors at all locations. Foveon was previously known as Foveonics. The name is derived from the fovea of the human eye, which enables sharp imaging while reading or watching television. George Gilder wrote The Silicon Eye, which tells the story of Foveon and its founders. On 11 November 2008, when Federico Faggin was the CEO, all shares of Foveon stock were acquired by Sigma Corporation. The company continued in a new location as a wholly owned portion of Sigma.

It lies east of the Lesser Sunda Islands, which include nearby Alor and Timor, but it is politically part of the Maluku Islands. To the south, across the Wetar Strait, lies the island of Timor; at its closest it is 50 km away. To the west, across the Ombai Strait, lies the island of Alor. To the southwest is the very small island of Liran, which is also part of Wetar district (kecamatan) and, further southwest, the small East Timorese island of Atauro. To the north is the Banda Sea and to the east lie Romang and Damar Islands, while to the southeast lie the other principal islands of the Barat Daya Islands. Including Liran, Wetar has an area of 2,651.9 km2, and had a population of 7,916 at the 2010 Census.Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. Wetar is one of the 92 officially listed outlying islands of Indonesia. The principal towns on Wetar are Lioppa in the northwest, Ilwaki in the south, Wasiri in the north, Masapun in the east, and Arwala in the northeast. These are connected by roads. Geography Wetar is 120 km long (measured from to east-most tip to west-most tip), and about 43 km north-to-south. It has an area of approximately 2652 km2. It is surrounded by coral reefs and deep seas. The highest point on the island is 1412 m. Wetar is part of a volcanic island arc which includes the other Barat Daya Islands and the Banda Islands, created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is not, however, principally of volcanic origin, being instead mainly oceanic crust that has been lifted by the plate collision. The stratovolcano Gunungapi Wetar forms an isolated island to the north of Wetar. There are a number of gold mines on Wetar, which have been poorly managed and constitute an environmental concern.A copper mine is under construction in the north of the island.

Along with other nearby islands, it formed part of Wallacea, the area of deep water separated from both the Asian and Australian continental shelves. This region is known for its unusual fauna, and Wetar is no exception. It has 162 species of birds, three of which are endemic, and four of which are endangered. Rainfall is highly seasonal based on the monsoon, and the islands are mostly covered in tropical dry broadleaf forests that are partly deciduous, with many trees losing their leaves in the dry season. It forms part of the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion. The island has a single lake, Danau Tihu. Culture There are a number of Malayo-Polynesian languages endemic to Wetar and the nearby islands of Liran and Atauro. Called Wetarese, they are Aputai, Ili'uun, Perai, and Tugun. There is also Talur, a dialect of Galoli of East Timor. These are spoken by small groups of about 1,000 people each. The national language Indonesian and regional Ambonese Malay are commonly used. The main economic activity on Wetar is subsistence agriculture, principally of sago. Tortoise shells are also gathered and exported to countries where the trade is not banned.

The town is an important tourist destination known as Zell am See-Kaprun and is a transportation hub for the region. Geography The Zell Valley is a corridor in the Kitzb√ºhel Alps, connecting the Saalfelden Basin of the Saalach River in the north and the Salzach in the south. Zell am See is located approximately east of Innsbruck and north of Mt. Grossglockner. The Old Village (Altstadt) centre of Zell am See is located on the western shore of deep Lake Zell, with the villages of Thumersbach to the east, Erlberg to the southeast, and Sch√ºttdorf directly to the south. =Subdivisions= Zell am See cadastral communities The village of Zell am See comprises five cadastral communities: #Bruckberg, a residential area including the Zellermoos locality #Erlberg on the southeastern shore of Lake Zell, including a nature reserve #Schmitten, above Zell am See proper, location of many cableways #Thumersbach, an affluent district and lakeside resort on the eastern shore, including the summer resort of Prielau in the north #Zell am See, with the Old Town centre and Zell am See-S√ºd (Sch√ºttdorf) =Landscape= The original Lake Zell reached somewhat further to the north and extended south to the Salzach river. The dimensions of the lake, however, have changed over time into marsh areas. The lake has the shape of a peanut, with an area of . Panoramic view from Lake Zell to Hoher Tenn massif (Zell am See on the right) The mountains of the area form a horseshoe shape, the slopes are mainly forested or covered with Alpine pastures. The Hausberg (\\"home mountain\\") of Zell am See is the Schmittenh√∂he, , which together with the adjacent Salzburg Slate Alps range in the west is part of the Greywacke zone between Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps. Mt. Schmittenh√∂he is a popular centre for skiing and winter sports. The nearby Mt. Hundstein (\\"Dog Stone\\") at is the highest peak of the Salzburg Greywacke Zone. Skiing Zell am See provides winter skiing on the above Schmittenh√∂he mountain. The skiable area is approximately 138 km, including the pistes on the Kitzsteinhorn and Kaprun Maiskogel. The ski pass covers the whole area including transport to and from the glacier which is open most of the year, dependent on snowfall. Zell am See is a low-altitude ski area and snow cover can suffer from higher temperatures, but the glacier has snow cover most of the year. In 2017 Zell am See announced a potential merger with Saalbach-Hinterglemm ski resort. In the 2019-2020 ski season the Zell am See Express 1 gondola was opened which allows access to the Zell am See Express 2 gondola at the base of piste 21 from Viehofen. Notable ski pistes in the resort include: The Trassabfahrt (14) which is the steepest piste in the region reaching an incline gradient of up to 75%, the Standardabfahrt (13) which is another valley run reaching an incline gradient of 60%, and the recently reopened Tannwaldabfahrt (21), a ski racing piste in the 1930s, and is well known for being consistently icy, and having a high steepness-width ratio in some sections of the piste. History Zell about 1900 The area of Zell am See was continuously populated at least since Roman times. About 740 AD, by order of Bishop Johannes (John) I of Salzburg, monks founded the village within the stem duchy of Bavaria, which was mentioned as Cella in Bisonzio in a 743 deed. The denotation Cella or German: Zelle refers to a monk's cell in the sense of a monastery, Bisonzio is the name of the Pinzgau region. Zell received the rights of a market town in 1357. During the German Peasants' War in 1526, the area was a site of heavy fighting against the troops of Swabian League. The Zell am See citizens had not participated in the uprising, nevertheless 200 years later, numerous Protestant inhabitants were expelled from Salzburg by order of Prince- Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian. From 1800, the town was occupied by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. After the secularisation of the Salzburg Archbishopric, \\"Zell am See\\" finally passed to the Austrian Empire by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1816. When in 1850 neighbouring Saalfelden became the capital of the Pinzgau district, the town's mayor successfully strived for relocating the administrative seat to Zell. The town's development was decisively promoted by the opening of the Salzburg- Tyrol Railway line (Giselabahn) on 30 July 1875, starting the annual summer tourism season. Zell am See received city rights on 24 January 24, 1928.

The church is built in a mostly Romanesque style and consists of three naves. Before 1794, the central nave was crowned with a Gothic vault, but in that year it was replaced with another vault, which in turn was replaced by a flat wooden roof in 1898. Four steps lead up to the main altar, but the crypt has been filled in. The narthex and aisles are still Gothic, but some of the other Gothic objects (like the neogothic altars by Josef Bachlehner) were added during the renovation in 1898, when also the baroque furnishings of preceding centuries were removed. The highpoint of the church is its elevated walkway with its ornate parapet, built in 1514. The walkway rests on four carved columns of precious marble, in between which an intricate net-vault is spun. The three pointed arches are crowned with crockets, and end in pointed towers. Between the arches are Gothic baldachins with cut-out figures of St Hippolyte and St Florian, originating from 1520. St Hippolyte's Church The tower is the main focus of the Zell am See skyline. It has a height of . The strong walls have a limestone exterior. From 1660 until 1670, the main altar was replaced by a Baroque one, which was removed again in 1760. Almost none of the Baroque furnishings of the church remain apart from some adornments. Two Baroque statues ended up in the church of Prielau. Next to the main altar are two statues dating from 1480: St Rupert and St Vigilius. The side altar contains an image of the Virgin Mary from the now non-existent Church of Maria Wald, which dates from 1540. The left nave has a small altar dedicated to St Sebastian in its apsis. The Grand Hotel Zell am See is situated in a unique position on a private peninsula right at the shore of Lake Zell, this large chalet is surrounded by water with a panoramic view of the mountains. The Porsche family farm is located in Zell am See, having been obtained in 1939 by the senior Ferdinand Porsche in anticipation of the war. During the war, he transferred some of his business operations here and to Gmund, away from Stuttgart where, notwithstanding the heavy bombing, his son Ferry Porsche remained to oversee plant operations.

The family emigrated to New Zealand when Ziman was a baby. He obtained his early education at Hamilton High School and the University of Wellington. He obtained his PhD from Balliol College, Oxford and did his early research on the theory of electrons in liquid metals at the University of Cambridge. In 1964 he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at University of Bristol, where he wrote his Elements Of Advanced Quantum Theory (1969) which explains the rudiments of quantum field theory with an elementary condensed matter slant. During this period, his interests shifted towards the philosophy of science. He argued about the social dimension of science, and the social responsibility of scientists in numerous essays and books. He married twice, to Rosemary Dixon in 1951 and secondly to Joan Solomon, and was survived by her and three of his four children.

He was appointed the first local justice minister when Tanganyika became a republic in 1962. He resigned from Cabinet in 1963 to protest the imminent legislation introducing a one party state. In 1964, he resigned from the civil service. In 1967, he was appointed as board chairman of the defunct East African Airways until 1972 when his term of office came to an end. The late Chief Fundikira continued running private business until 1990, when he spearheaded the debate on multipartism in Tanzania in collaboration with other politicians such as the late Kassanga Tumbo, Prince Bagenda, Mabere Marando, Ndimara Tegambwage, when they formed a national political reform committee (NCCR). In 1993, soon after the birth of multiparty democracy in the country, Fundikira formed the UMD party and took part in the 1995 presidential election in which CCM emerged victorious, with Benjamin Mkapa being announced as the winner. He held the party's top leadership post until 1999 when he crossed over to CCM. After the 2000 general elections, President Mkapa appointed him a nominated MP until 2005. He remained a CCM member until his death. According to the Wanyamwezi tradition, the burial of a chief should be conducted at night but, in this case, Chief Fundikira will be buried at 6.00pm just before sun set. Fundikira: The long journey He was among the first Ministers in the Uhuru cabinet, having served as Justice Minister. Fundikira hailed from a family of Nyamwezi chiefs but lost his title after founding President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere scrapped the chiefdoms set up in the country. However efforts were made by the Uhuru Government to incorporate tribal leaders, such as himself in the Government system. Such were gestures of goodwill meant to strengthen national unity above tribal inclinations. In 1961, he became president of the East African Muslim Welfare Society, an organisation of a few Muslims, which sought better access to education. The organisation was founded in 1945 by the Aga Khan with the aim of promoting Islam and raising the standard of living for East African Muslims. As the country headed back towards the road to multi party politics, Fundikira played a pivotal role in organising the opposition by chairing the first interim structure of an opposition umbrella body under the name National Committee for Constitutional Reforms. He later formed his own party, the Union for Multiparty Democracy, but latter shifted camp to the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi. In 2005, Fundikira was nominated as Member of Parliament by former President Benjamin Mkapa along with a host of others, including Makongoro Nyerere and Anne Kilango of CCM. Chief Abdallah Fundikira died on 6 August 2007 in his sleep. He had a state funeral and was buried on the 8th of August at the Itetemia royal burial site next to his father the late Chief Said Fundikira.

The park houses one of the largest concentration of cultural venues in Paris, including the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie (City of Science and Industry, Europe's largest science museum), three major concert venues, and the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris. Parc de la Villette is served by Paris M√©tro stations Corentin Cariou on Line 7 and Porte de Pantin on Line 5. History The abattoir at La Villette at its opening in 1867 The park was designed by Bernard Tschumi, a French architect of Swiss origin, who built it from 1984 to 1987 in partnership with Colin Fournier, on the site of the huge Parisian abattoirs (slaughterhouses) and the national wholesale meat market, as part of an urban redevelopment project. The slaughterhouses, built in 1867 on the instructions of Napol√©on III, had been cleared away and relocated in 1974. Tschumi won a major design competition in 1982‚Äì83 for the park, and he sought the opinions of the deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida in the preparation of his design proposal. Since the creation of the park, museums, concert halls, and theatres have been designed by several noted contemporary architects, including Christian de Portzamparc, Adrien Fainsilber, Philippe Chaix, Jean-Paul Morel, G√©rard Chamayou, on to Mr. Tschumi. Park attractions Plan of the Parc de la Villette The park houses museums, concert halls, live performance stages, and theatres, as well as playgrounds for children, and thirty-five architectural follies.

Since its completion in 1987, the Parc de la Villette has become a popular attraction for Paris residents and international travelers alike. An estimated 10 million people visit the park each year to take part in an array of cultural activities. With its collection of museums, theatres, architectural follies, themed gardens, and open spaces for exploration and activity, the park has created an area that relates to both adults and children. Designed by Bernard Tschumi, the park is meant to be a place inspired by the post-modernist architectural ideas of deconstructivism. Tschumi's design was in partial response to the philosophies of Jacques Derrida, acting as an architectural experiment in space (through a reflection on Plato's Kh√¥ra), form, and how those relate a person's ability to recognize and interact.Jacques Derrida Limited Inc (Northwestern University Press, 2000) pp. 21‚Äì22, 140‚Äì142. According to Tschumi, the intention of the park was to create space for activity and interaction, rather than adopt the conventional park mantra of ordered relaxation and self-indulgence. The vast expanse of the park allows for visitors to walk about the site with a sense of freedom and opportunity for exploration and discovery. The design of the park is organized into a series of points, lines, and surfaces.Jay Berman ‚ÄúLe Parc de la Villette, Paris‚Äù Galinsky.com/buildings/villette/. 1999 Retrieved 2010-03-09. These categories of spatial relation and formulation are used in Tschumi's design to act as a means of deconstructing the traditional views of how a park is conventionally meant to exist. Activities The Cabaret Sauvage concert venue, in the foreground, designed by M√©ziane Aza√Øche, 1997 with the G√©ode behind. The Parc de la Villette boasts activities that engage all people of all ages and cultural backgrounds. The park is a contemporary melting pot of cultural expression where local artists and musicians produce exhibits and performances. On the periphery of the park lies the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie, the largest science museum in Europe. There are a convention center and an I-MAX theatre. The park acts as a connection between these exterior functions. Concerts are scheduled year-round, hosting local and mainstream musicians. Dividing the park is the Canal de l'Ourcq, which has boat tours that transport visitors around the park and to other sites in Paris. Festivals are common in the park along with artist conventions and shows by performers. The Parc de la Villette hosts an annual open-air film festival. In 2010 the festival's theme was \\"To Be 20\\" (\\"Avoir 20 ans\\") and featured films about youth and self-discovery around the age of 20. In 2010 films were shown by American filmmakers Woody Allen and Sofia Coppola as well as French and international filmmakers.New York Habitat Blog \\"Paris‚Äô Annual Open Air Film Festival\\" 2010-07-06 Retrieved 2010-09-17. Gardens The Jardin de la Treille Jean-Max Albert, Sculptures Bachelard, 1986 The Parc de la Villette has a collection of ten themed gardens that attract a large number of the park's visitors. Each garden is created with a different representation of architectural deconstructionism and tries to create space through playfully sculptural and clever means. While some of the gardens are minimalist in design, others are clearly constructed with children in mind. Le \\"Jardin du Dragon\\" (The Garden of the Dragon) is home to a large sculptural steel dragon that has an 80-foot slide for children to play on.‚ÄúParc de la Villette: Modern Park in Paris‚Äù Paris-Walking-Tours.com. Retrieved 2010-03-12. The \\"Jardin de Bambou\\" (Bamboo Garden) at the Parc de la Villette was designed by Alexandre Chemetoff, winner of the Grand Prix de l'urbanisme (2000). The \\"Jardin de la Treille\\" (Trellis Garden) designed by Gilles Vexlard and Laurence Vacherot. Vines and creepers are going along a roof trellis and 90 small fountains designed so that you only really hear the murmur of them in between the grape vines. 7 Sculptures de vis√©es (Sculptures Bachelard) by Jean-Max AlbertJean- Max Albert's observation sculptures Sarah Mc Fadden, The Bulletin N¬∞ 24, Bruxelles, June 16th 1994 are installed all around and an anamorphosis reflection is displayed in a small pool.Fran√ßois Lamarre, Jean-Max Albert illusioniste √©clectique, L‚Äôempreinte N¬∞ 27, d√©cembre 1994 The gardens range in function; where some gardens are meant for active engagement, others exist to play off of curiosity and investigation or merely allow for relaxation. Follies Probably the most iconic pieces of the park, the follies act as architectural representations of deconstruction. In architecture, a folly (in French, folie) is a building constructed primarily for decoration, but suggesting by its appearance some other purpose, or so extravagant that it transcends the normal range of garden ornaments or other class of building to which it belongs. Architecturally, the follies are meant to act as points of reference that help visitors gain a sense of direction and navigate throughout the space. Twenty-six follies, made of metal and painted bright red, are placed on a grid and offer a distinct organization to the park.J. Daniel Pugh ‚ÄúParc de la Villette, Paris‚Äù 2004-09-30 Retrieved 2010-03-10. Each is identified by a name and a code letter-number.\\"Folies - Red metal structures - Parc de la Villette\\" at Travel France Online, posted April 4, 2019.

Daniel Pugh ‚ÄúParc de la Villette, Paris‚Äù 2004-09-30 Retrieved 2010-03-10. While the follies are meant to exist in a deconstructive vacuum without historical relation, many have found connections between the steel structures and the previous buildings that were part of the old industrial fabric of the area.John Hill ‚ÄúParc de la Villette‚Äù Archidose.org. Retrieved 2010-03-10. Today, the follies remain as cues to organization and direction for park visitors. Some of them house restaurants, information centers, and other functions associated with the park's needs.

There have been many criticisms of the innovative design of the park since its original completion. To some, the park has little concern with the human scale of park functions and the vast open space seem to challenge the expectation that visitors may have of an urban park. Bernard Tschumi designed the Parc de la Villette with the intention of creating a space that exists in a vacuum, something without historical precedent.Bernard Tschumi, Cin√©gramme folie: le Parc de la Villette (Princeton Architectural Press, 1987) p. 32. The park strives to strip down the signage and conventional representations that have infiltrated architectural design and allow for the existence of a ‚Äúnon-place.‚Äù This non- place, envisioned by Tschumi, is the most appropriate example of space and provides a truly honest relationship between the subject and the object.A. Papadakƒìs Deconstruction in Architecture (Academy Editions, 1988) pp. 20‚Äì24. Visitors view and react to the plan, landscaping, and sculptural pieces without the ability to cross-reference them with previous works of historical architecture. The design of the park capitalizes on the innate qualities that are illustrated within architectural deconstructivism. By allowing visitors to experience the architecture of the park within this constructed vacuum, the time, recognitions, and activities that take place in that space begin to acquire a more vivid and authentic nature.Bernard Tschumi Disjunctions (MIT Press, 1987.) pp. 108‚Äì119. The park is not acting as a spectacle; it is not an example of traditional park design such as New York City's Central Park. The Parc de la Villette strives to act as merely a frame for other cultural interaction. The park embodies anti-tourism, not allowing visitors to breeze through the site and pick and choose the sites they want to see. Upon arrival in the park, visitors are thrust into a world that is not defined by conventional architectural relationships. The frame of the park, due to its roots in deconstructivism, tries to change and react to the functions that it holds within.Bernard Tschumi and Yokio Futagawa Bernard Tschumi ‚ÄúParc de la Villette‚Äù (A.D.A.

It is not very well researched yet, but generally assumed to be caused by a bacterial infection. NHP mainly affects the farmed shrimp species Litopenaeus vannamei (Pacific white shrimp) and Litopenaeus stylirostris (Western blue shrimp), but has also been reported in three other American species, namely Farfantepenaeus aztecus, Farfantepenaeus californiensis, and Litopenaeus setiferus. The highest mortality rates occur in L. vannamei, which is one of the two most frequently farmed species of shrimp. Untreated, the disease causes mortality rates of up to 90 percent within 30 days. A first outbreak of NHP had been reported in Texas in 1985; the disease then spread to shrimp aquacultures in South America. NHP is associated with a small, gram- negative, and highly pleomorphic Rickettsia-like bacterium that belongs to its own, new genus in the class Alphaproteobacteria. The aetiological agent is the pathogenic agent Candidatus Hepatobacter penaei, an obligate intracellular bacterium of the Order Œ±-Proteobacteria. Infected shrimps show gross signs including soft shells and flaccid bodies, black or darkened gills, dark edges of the pleopods, and uropods, and an atrophied hepatopancreas that is whitish instead of orange or tan as is usual. The pathogen that causes NHP seems to prefer high water temperatures (above ) and elevated levels of salinity (more than 20‚Äì38 ppt). Avoiding such conditions in shrimp ponds is thus an important disease control measure.

Close to Nikita Mikhailovich Muravyov in his views, he was declared the group's leader on the eve of the December 26 uprising in 1825 but failed to appear, and instead sought refuge in the Austrian embassy. Early years Trubetskoy was born in the noble Trubetskoy family. His father was Prince Pyotr Sergeyevich Troubetzkoy (1760‚Äì1817). His mother, Daria (d. 1796), was a daughter of the Georgian prince Alexander Bakarovich Gruzinsky. Troubetzkoy received home education, since 1806 he was attending lectures in the Moscow University. In 1808 he entered Leib Guards Semyonovsky regiment. As a soldier, he participated in all significant battles of Sixth Coalition campaign in 1812-1814 including battle of Borodino, battle of Maloyaroslavets, Battle of L√ºtzen, battle of Bautzen and battle of Kulm and received many orders. In the battle of Leipzig he was badly wounded. After the war he continued military service and in 1821 he was promoted to Colonel. Decembrists Trubetskoy in the 1830s, by Nikolay Bestuzhev After the war Trubetskoy became a Freemason, a member of the Lodge of the Three Virtues. He was among the founders of the first proto- Decembrists societies - the Union of Salvation (1816) and later the Union of Prosperity (1819). The two unions were largely based on freemasonry. They sought gradual improvement of the Russian Empire, but hadn't adopted some goals the Decembrists did later: complete abolition of serfdom, introduction of constitution and constitutionally secured liberties, abolition of privileges of upper estates of the realm. In 1819 Trubetskoy went abroad for treatment. When he returned in 1821 he found the Union had ceased to exist. Trubetskoy was one of the founders and leaders of the Northern Society. Trubestkoy advocated Constitutional monarchy, but other Decembrists desired revolution, to execute the tsar and establish a republic (e.g. Ryleev and Pestel). He was elected \\"dictator\\" but did not come to Senate Square, most probably because he expected the revolt to fail. He was arrested the next day at the apartments of Count Ludwig Lebzeltern, his brother-in-law and the Austrian Empire's minister to St. Petersburg. Katorga and exile Trubetskoy was sentenced to death but the sentence was changed to katorga for life in Nerchinsk coal mines. Trubetskoy's wife Ekaterina Laval (a rich heiress of Ekaterina Kozitskaya's fortune) went to exile with him. Her feat (she voluntarily renounced all wealth and privileges and subjected herself to hard life in katorga) was subject of a famous poem by Nekrasov. In 1839 his family was allowed to live in exile in Irkutsk, and he eventually also received permission. In 1854 his wife died. In 1856 he along with other survived Decembrists was granted amnesty, his children were given their titles, and he was able to return to Russia. He wrote memoirs which were published for the first time in 1863 by Alexander Herzen in London.  See also  *Decembrist revolt *Troubetzkoy *Notes of Prince S. P.

Halfdan Egedius: Illustration for Olav Trygvasons saga (1899) Jarl Sigvaldi was the semi-legendary chieftain of the fabled Jomsvikings and commander of their stronghold - Jomsborg. He succeeded Palnatoke as the leaders of the Jomsvikings in the late 10th century. The character of Sigvaldi remains largely enigmatic. As a leader, he was said to be more wily than brave despite leading such a powerful force. Biography Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson was the son of Jarl Strut-Harald, who ruled over the Danish territory of Scania and the brother of Thorkell the Tall.Fl√∏tre, Odd Karstein (2009) Jomsvikingslaget i oppklarende lys (Hatlehols AS) In order to win Astrid, the daughter of the Wendish chieftain Burislav, he promised to liberate the Wends of the tribute they had to pay to the Danes. He fulfilled his promise by sailing to Zealand where he sent the message to King Sweyn Forkbeard that he had important tidings, but had fallen ill and could not come in person to bring them to him. When Sweyn went aboard Sigvaldi's ship, he was captured by the Jomsvikings. To be liberated, the Danish king had to agree to grant independence to both the Jomsvikings and to the Wends, in addition to paying a king's ransom. In further negotiations, it was agreed that Sweyn would marry Gunhild of Wenden, the daughter of Burislav, while Burislav would marry Sweyn's sister Tyri. At the time of the funeral of his father, Strut-Harald, Sigvaldi was advised by Sweyn to join the attack on Norway to depose Haakon Sigurdsson. This promise would lead to the defeat of Jomsvikings at the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr in 986, from which Sigvaldi fled with disgrace.Slupecki, Leszek P. (2006) Facts and Fancy in J√≥msv√≠kinga saga (The 13th International Saga Conference - Durham University) In 1000, Sigvaldi proved to be treacherous at the Battle of Svolder by luring Olaf Tryggvason to the battle. According to Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, Sigvaldi arrived to tell him rumors of a planned ambush were false. He led him into an ambush and deserted him in the heat of battle. There is no record of Sigvaldi after the Battle of Svolder. The invasion of England in 1009 by his brother Thorkell the Tall was allegedly intended to avenge Sigvaldi's death, so it is possible Sigvald met his end in England.

Life and career Annabella was born in Paris, France. Annabella's chance to enter films came when her father entertained a film producer, who gave her a small part in Abel Gance's great classic Napol√©on (1927). She was not critically acclaimed until she starred in Ren√© Clair's Le Million (1931), and over the following decade established herself as one of France's most popular cinema actresses. For Veille d'armes (1935), she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1936. Annabella with Tyrone Power, 1946: They were married in 1939 and divorced in 1948. She was cast as the female lead in the British-made film Wings of the Morning (1937) with Henry Fonda. Under contract to 20th Century Fox, she traveled to America and appeared in Suez (1938) with Loretta Young and Tyrone Power. Her romance with Power was widely reported by movie magazines of the day. Darryl F. Zanuck, movie mogul at 20th Century Fox, did not want his matinee idol married. He offered Annabella a multi-movie deal that would take her overseas. She refused to leave Power, and on completion of Suez, she returned to France to obtain a divorce from her then-husband, Jean Murat.Biography: Tyrone Power: The Last Idol (1996). A&E; Transcript Power and she married on 23 April 1939. The two honeymooned in Rome. Within a few months, Annabella and Power had again flown to Europe to bring Annabella's mother back to live in their home, while her father and brother stayed behind. Her brother was ultimately shot and killed by the Nazis. Annabella made a return trip to bring her daughter, Anne, back from France to live with them. Power adopted Anne before leaving for service in the United States Marine Corps in August 1942.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=155263514 Anne Power later married actor Oskar Werner.Guiles, Fred Lawrence.

Annabella was also not lent to other studios. Power and she appeared together in the play Liliom in New Haven, Connecticut. While Power was away during his war service, Annabella appeared in Blithe Spirit in Chicago. On Broadway, she received excellent notices for her work in the play Jacobowsky and the Colonel, directed by Elia Kazan, in 1944. Annabella also embarked on an affair with author Roald Dahl; she had refused to give Power a divorce to marry Judy Garland, and her marriage was strained. Dahl told his wife, Liccy, that it was an intense and passionate relationship, during which Dahl learned a lot about sex from the actress.Sturrock, Donald. (2010) Storyteller Roald Dahl: The Biography. Harper Collins Publ. UK When Power returned from the war, the couple decided to try to make their marriage work once again. Annabella again worked in films, playing the female lead in 13 Rue Madeleine (1947) with James Cagney. Power and she finally divorced in 1948, and Annabella returned to France. She appeared in film director Jos√© Luis S√°enz de Heredia's Spanish version of Don Juan (1950), and her final film was released in 1952. After a 1954 television appearance in the American series Suspense, she retired. Annabella and Tyrone Power remained very close, and after his divorce from Linda Christian, he attempted to reconcile with her, confessing that in giving her up, he had made a terrible mistake. However, Annabella refused. Power informed her that he would not take the elevator to leave her apartment, but the stairs, in case she changed her mind and called him back. She did not. Annabella died in 1996 after suffering a heart attack in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, aged 89, and was interred in Passy Cemetery in Haute-Savoie (France).

Note the four separate thread \\"steps\\" on the block which engage with matching steps in the breech when the block is swung up and inwards and rotated slightly clockwise The Welin breech block was a revolutionary stepped, interrupted thread design for locking artillery breeches, invented by Axel Welin in 1889 or 1890. Shortly after, Vickers acquired the British patents. Welin breech blocks provide obturation for artillery pieces which use separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. In this system the projectile is loaded first and then followed by cloth bags of propellant. Design 12-inch gun on HMAS Australia, 1918. This breech was locked by rotating counter-clockwise The breech block screw incorporates multiple threaded \\"steppings\\" of progressively larger radius and a gap step occupying each circular section. A three step breech block screw's circular area would nominally be divided into quarters, with each quarter containing three threaded sections of progressively increasing height and a gap step for insertion. Each step engages with its matching thread cut in the gun breech when inserted and rotated. A gap in the thread steps was still necessary for the insertion of the largest step before rotation, so the area of the breech secured by threads in the block is: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{number of steps} }{1 + \\\\text{number of steps}} \\\\times \\\\text{length of the screw} This was a major improvement on previous, non-stepped designs such as the de Bange system. The breech loader [of the] de Bange system uses a single thread step and can only engage half of the block's circumferential threads with the breech, necessitating a long screw to achieve a strong lock. Efficiency is gained with multiple thread step heights on an interrupted screw because the smaller thread steps may be inserted into the breech along the radial vector of any larger step, whereas a single thread step interrupted screw cannot be inserted where any threads of the breech lay in the radial vector as any threads of the screw. Thread lock area is directly related to the munitions strength which may be safely fired, and thus large munitions needed unreasonably large breech screws. The much greater threaded area of the Welin block allowed it to be shorter, making operation faster than previous designs and possible in much tighter space.Brassey's Naval Annual 1899, page 389 http://www.gwpda.org/naval/brassey/b1899o06.htm It was also simpler and more secure. 15-inch gun from inside the barrel in the Coventry Ordnance Works during WWI The Welin breech was a single motion screw, allowing it to be operated much faster than previous interrupted-thread breeches, and it became very common on British and American large calibre naval artillery and also field artillery above about .

He was christened on 19 January 1740 in St James's Church, Piccadilly, in Westminster. He attended Trinity College, Oxford. In 1763 he was in Italy with John Fitzpatrick. In 1774 he lived in Muswell Hill, north London. On 12 March 1768 he married Diana (1734-1808), former Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Charlotte. She was born into the Spencer family as the daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough and the Honourable Elizabeth Trevor. Diana had married in 1757 as her first husband Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke. This marriage, which gave her two sons, was unhappy and her husband was notoriously unfaithful. In February 1768 he petitioned for divorce on grounds of adultery (\\"criminal conversation\\"). The petition required an act of parliament, which was passed the next month. Soon thereafter she married Beauclerk. They had four children together: * Anne Beauclerk (born c. 1764) * Elisabeth Beauclerk (20 August 1766 ‚Äì 25 March 1793); married George Augustus Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke and 8th Earl of Montgomery. * Mary Day Beauclerk, twin of Elisabeth (20 August 1766 ‚Äì 23 July 1851) * Charles George Beauclerk (20 January 1774 ‚Äì 25 December 1846), briefly an MP; on 29 April 1799 married Emily Charlotte \\"Mimie\\" Ogilvie (May 1778‚Äì22 January 1832), daughter of William Ogilvie and Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster; father of Aubrey Beauclerk (politician)) thumb From 1772-1776 he lived at 3 Adelphi Terrace.'Adelphi Terrace', in Survey of London: Volume 18, St Martin-in-The-Fields II: the Strand, ed.

Beauclerk died at his house in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury on 11 March 1780. Lady Diana later sold the house to retire in reduced circumstances to Richmond. The house at Great Russell Street, which was partly demolished in 1788, housed a library designed by Robert Adam. Friendships and anecdotes Topham Beauclerk entertained Dr Johnson at his home in Old Windsor for a number of weeks. He appears several times in James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson. As Bennet Langton records: \\"His affection for Topham Beauclerk was so great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death, Johnson said (with a voice faultering with emotion), 'Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save Beauclerk'.\\" (Boswell 1672). He was an intimate friend also of Horace Walpole. The artist Joseph Farington records Walpole's description of him: > Lord Orford mentioned many particulars relative to the late Mr. Topham > Beauclerc. He said He was the worst tempered man He ever knew. Lady Di > passed a most miserable life with him. Lord O, out of regard to her invited > them occasionally to pass a few days at Strawberry Hill.

It runs through parts of the Portsoken and Bishopsgate Without wards of the City of London, the historic nucleus and modern financial centre of London. It marks the route of an old ditch that ran outside a part of the London Wall, renowned for being used as a site for disposing of waste and, particularly, deceased dogs. The road forms part of the A1211 route from Barbican to Whitechapel. Traffic continues onto Houndsditch from Outwich Street, a short section of road behind the Heron Tower, and then enters St. Botolph Street at the south-eastern end of Houndsditch. From there, traffic may turn left onto Whitechapel High Street or right onto Aldgate High Street. History 1872 engraving of Houndsditch by Gustave Dor√© A ditch was dug outside Londinium's defensive wall by the Romans but was subsequently filled in and obliterated. The Danes under Cnut the Great constructed a town ditch to control access to the city.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles Earle and Plummer The ditch was redug in 1211 as a part of the defences, and was about in width. The city authorities found it a continual problem to scour and clean as many adjacent houses found it a convenient place to dispose of filth and refuse. In 1595, levelling was first considered,Horsmylle (le) - Hucker's Court, St. Nicholas Lane A Dictionary of London (1918) accessed: 28 May 2008. although the street running alongside the ditch had first been paved in 1503. The name Houndsditche appears in the 13th century, and seems to relate to the quantity of rubbish and dead dogs thrown into it;Stow (ibid) previously it seems to have been referred to only by the appellation \\"the Ditch\\". Several dogs' skeletons were unearthed at Houndsditch in 1989. By the turn of the 20th century, the street had become a thriving market in clothing and novelties, giving rise to one of London's leading department stores, the Houndsditch Warehouse, dubbed the \\"Selfridges of the Jewish Quarter\\". In December 1910, anarchists killed three police officers who had interrupted them during an attempted burglary at a jeweller's shop at No. 119, Houndsditch. In January 1911, two of the gang were cornered and killed in the Siege of Sidney Street. Description Approaching Bishopsgate, the modern office blocks do not occupy the full building plots, leaving some small areas empty. These were historically the sites of Plague pits. Traffic flows one-way south-eastward from Outwich Street down the modern Houndsditch, which continues onto St. Botolph Street, connecting to either Aldgate High Street (west) or Whitechapel High Street (east). The street is the location of a number of restaurants, bars and offices, and a short pedestrianised section of it runs along the north side of the Heron Tower, the tallest building in the City of London. The nearest London Underground station is Aldgate and the closest mainline railway station is Liverpool Street. The street is served by London Buses routes 42, 78, 100, 135, and 205. In popular culture Houndsditch is the location of the 1945 film Kitty. It is described as a slum, set in 1783.

Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult. Rupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot when the calf muscle is engaged, direct trauma, or long-standing tendonitis. Other risk factors include the use of fluoroquinolones, a significant change in exercise, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or corticosteroid use. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination and supported by medical imaging. Prevention may include stretching before activity. Treatment may be by surgery repair or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down. Relatively rapid return to weight bearing (within 4 weeks) appears okay. While surgery traditionally results in a small decrease in the risk of re-rupture, the risk of other complications is greater. Additionally rapid rehabilitation may remove this difference in ruptures. If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes are not as good. Achilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10,000 people per year. Males are more commonly affected than females. People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected. The tendon itself was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles. Signs and symptoms The main symptom is typically the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking then becomes difficult. Causes The Achilles tendon is most commonly injured by sudden plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the ankle, or by forced dorsiflexion of the ankle outside its normal range of motion. Other mechanisms by which the Achilles can be torn involve sudden direct trauma to the tendon, or sudden activation of the Achilles after atrophy from prolonged periods of inactivity. Some other common tears can occur from overuse while participating in intense sports. Twisting or jerking motions can also contribute to injury. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, famously ciprofloxacin, are known to increase the risk of tendon rupture, particularly Achilles. People who commonly fall victim to Achilles rupture or tear include recreational athletes, people of old age, individuals with previous Achilles tendon tears or ruptures, previous tendon injections or quinolone use, extreme changes in training intensity or activity level, and participation in a new activity. Most cases of Achilles tendon rupture are traumatic sports injuries. The average age of patients is 29‚Äì40 years with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:1. Direct steroid injections into the tendon have also been linked to rupture. The use of quinolone antibiotics can cause several forms of tendinitis and tendon rupture, including rupture of the Achilles tendon. The risk is higher in people who are older than 60, who are also taking corticosteroids, or have kidney disease; it also increases with dose and taking them for longer periods of time. As of 2016 the mechanism through which quinolones cause this, was unclear. Anatomy Achilles tendon tear. The Achilles tendon is the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, connecting the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris to the calcaneus. It is approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) long and begins near the middle portion of the calf. Contraction of the gastrosoleus plantar flexes the foot, enabling such activities as walking, jumping, and running. The Achilles tendon receives its blood supply from its musculotendinous junction with the triceps surae and its innervation from the sural nerve and to a lesser degree from the tibial nerve. Diagnosis Calf squeeze test in a person with a right Achilles tendon rupture Diagnosis may be based on symptoms and the history of the event; typically people say it feels like being kicked or shot behind the ankle. Upon examination a gap may be felt just above the heel unless swelling has filled the gap and the Simmonds' test (aka Thompson test) will be positive; squeezing the calf muscles of the affected side while the person lies on their stomach, face down, with his feet hanging loose results in no movement (no passive plantarflexion) of the foot, while movement is expected with an intact Achilles tendon and should be observable upon manipulation of the uninvolved calf. Walking will usually be severely impaired, as the person will be unable to step off the ground using the injured leg. The person will also be unable to stand up on the toes of that leg, and pointing the foot downward (plantarflexion) will be impaired. Pain may be severe, and swelling is common. Sometimes an ultrasound scan may be required to clarify or confirm the diagnosis and is recommended over MRI. MRI is generally not needed. =Imaging= Achilles tendon rupture seen on ultrasound. Note discontinuity over several centimeters (red line). No fracture or avulsion (radiograph). Musculoskeletal ultrasonography can be used to determine the tendon thickness, character, and presence of a tear. It works by sending extremely high frequencies of sound through the body. Some of these sounds are reflected back off the spaces between interstitial fluid and soft tissue or bone. These reflected images can be analyzed and computed into an image. These images are captured in real time and can be very helpful in detecting movement of the tendon and visualising possible injuries or tears. This device makes it very easy to spot structural damages to soft tissues, and consistent method of detecting this type of injury. This imaging modality is inexpensive, involves no ionizing radiation and, in the hands of skilled ultrasonographers, may be very reliable. MRI can be used to discern incomplete ruptures from degeneration of the Achilles tendon, and MRI can also distinguish between paratenonitis, tendinosis, and bursitis. This technique uses a strong uniform magnetic field to align millions of protons running through the body. These protons are then bombarded with radio waves that knock some of them out of alignment. When these protons return they emit their own unique radio waves that can be analysed by a computer in 3D to create sharp cross sectional image of the area of interest. MRI can provide unparalleled contrast in soft tissue for an extremely high quality photograph making it easy for technicians to spot tears and other injuries. Radiography can also be used to indirectly identify Achilles tears. Radiography uses X-rays to analyse the point of injury. This is not very effective at identifying injuries to soft tissue. X-rays are created when high energy electrons hit a metal source. X-ray images are acquired by utilising the different attenuation characteristics of dense (e.g. calcium in bone) and less dense (e.g. muscle) tissues when these rays pass through tissue and are captured on film. X-rays are generally exposed to optimise visualisation of dense objects such as bone while soft tissue remains relatively undifferentiated in the background. Radiography has little role in assessment of Achilles' tendon injury and is more useful for ruling out other injuries such as calcaneal fractures. Treatment Surgical repair of a ruptured Achilles tendon. Treatment options include surgical and non-surgical approaches. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture however it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. =Surgery= There are two different types of surgeries; open surgery and percutaneous surgery. During an open surgery an incision is made in the back of the leg and the Achilles tendon is stitched together. In a complete or serious rupture the tendon of plantaris or another vestigial muscle is harvested and wrapped around the Achilles tendon, increasing the strength of the repaired tendon. If the tissue quality is poor, e.g. the injury has been neglected, the surgeon might use a reinforcement mesh (collagen, Artelon or other degradable material). In percutaneous surgery, the surgeon makes several small incisions, rather than one large incision, and sews the tendon back together through the incision(s). Surgery may be delayed for about a week after the rupture to let the swelling go down. For sedentary patients and those who have vasculopathy or risks for poor healing, percutaneous surgical repair may be a better treatment choice than open surgical repair. =Rehabilitation= Non-surgical treatment used to involve very long periods in a series of casts, and took longer to complete than surgical treatment. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. It used to be that patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities. Modern studies including non-surgical patients generally limit non-weight-bearing (NWB) to two weeks, and use modern removable boots, either fixed or hinged, rather than casts. Physiotherapy is often begun as early as two weeks following the start of either kind of treatment. There are three things that need to be kept in mind while rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles: range of motion, functional strength, and sometimes orthotic support. Range of motion is important because it takes into mind the tightness of the repaired tendon. When beginning rehab a patient should perform stretches lightly and increase the intensity as time and pain permits. Putting linear stress on the tendon is important because it stimulates connective tissue repair, which can be achieved while performing the ‚Äúrunners stretch,‚Äù (putting your toes a couple inches up the wall while your heel is on the ground). Doing stretches to gain functional strength are also important because it improves healing in the tendon, which will in turn lead to a quicker return to activities. These stretches should be more intense and should involve some sort of weight bearing, which helps reorient and strengthen the collagen fibers in the injured ankle. A popular stretch used for this phase of rehabilitation is the toe raise on an elevated surface. The patient is to push up onto the toes and lower his or her self as far down as possible and repeat several times. The other part of the rehab process is orthotic support. This doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with stretching or strengthening the tendon, rather it is in place to keep the patient comfortable. These are custom made inserts that fit into the patients shoe and help with proper pronation of the foot, which is otherwise a problem that can lead to problems with the Achilles. To briefly summarize the steps of rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles tendon, you should begin with range of motion type stretching. This will allow the ankle to get used to moving again and get ready for weight bearing activities. Then there is functional strength, this is where weight bearing should begin in order to start strengthening the tendon and getting it ready to perform daily activities and eventually in athletic situations.

Like the purple emperor this butterfly uses 'master trees', usually European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Males and unmated females congregate at the tops of isolated trees. Once mated the female descends to lower levels to begin laying her eggs. Males rarely descend and both feed mainly on honeydew. Both sexes are dark brown on the upperside with orange tails. The female also has a bright orange band across both forewings. The undersides are similar in both sexes and are bright orange with two white streaks. Life cycle and food plants Egg In Europe the female lays her eggs on blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) in late August which overwinter, hatching the following spring when the buds are breaking. It has been found that the best way to find breeding sites for this species is to look for the conspicuous white eggs in the winter. The larvae are extremely well camouflaged and feed only at night, remaining motionless during the day. Pupation takes place in leaf litter on the ground in late June or early July and are attractive to ants who will bury them in shallow cells.

The larva, which is already developed in the sunmier, does not leave the egg before April; it bores into the young shoots and later lies on the young leaves, especially on those of the lower twigs of old oak-trees. It is a dreadful cannibal and is evidently avoided by insect-eating birds, as it has been found unmolested in the nest of the blue tit containing young birds (Bingham-Newland). On the other hand it is much infested with ichneumons, as well as a species of Tachina, which develops after the pupation of the caterpillar (Steinfert). Adult yellowish brown with a reddish tint, on the back a row of triangles connected by a dark line, the sides greenish. On various species of oak, and said to occur also on other plants (Myrica, etc.); adult in July. The pupa rounded, brown, irregularly spotted with blackish,on the back three rows of dark spots. The butterflies occur from June till August everywhere in the plains and hills, but usually singly, in certain years more plentifully. They rest on the outer twigs of oak-bushes with the wings always closed, but sometimes flutter high up about the crowns of old oaks.Seitz, A. Seitz, A. ed. Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) Appearance, behaviour and distribution (British Isles) This active little butterfly is most often seen fluttering around high up in oak trees on warm sunny July and early August days. Males have a glossy purple sheen on the upperside, females have two patches on the forewing only. The underside is light grey with a white streak, edged in black, running down the middle of both wings. The hindwings have a short tail with two orange spots at the base on the underside. It is common and widespread across southern and central England and Wales, becoming rarer and more isolated in the north as far as central Scotland. In Ireland it occurs in a few isolated colonies scattered across the country but is probably still under recorded due to its reclusive habits. Males tend to stay high up in trees, females come down to lower levels to lay eggs. Both sexes feed mainly on honeydew although females are occasionally attracted to flowers whilst taking a break from egg laying. Life cycle and foodplants Eggs are laid singly at the base of oak buds in late summer ready to hatch the following spring as the buds break. Both sessile oak Quercus petraea and pedunculate oak Quercus robur, Britain's two native oaks are used and also some introduced species such as Turkey oak Quercus cerris and evergreen oak Quercus ilex. In winter the eggs are easily found on close examination of bare branches. The caterpillar is fully developed inside the egg after two or three weeks but doesn't hatch until the spring whereupon it burrows into the flower buds to feed safely concealed. As it gets larger and the buds open it spins a silken retreat and feeds only at night. Pupation usually takes place in the leaf litter where it is tended by ants who bury them, but also sometimes in a crevice in the bark of the foodplant. There is one brood a year with adults on the wing in July and August.

Appearance and behaviour A dark little butterfly that spends the majority of its life in the tree tops, feeding on honeydew, making it best observed through binoculars. The uppersides are a dark brown with a small orange spot in the bottom corner of the hindwing. The male has a small pale spot on the forewings made up of scent scales. The undersides are a lighter brown with a thin white line, the \\"hairstreak\\", which gives this group of butterflies their name. On the hindwing this streak zigzags to form a letter W (or M) from which this species gets its name. The outer edge of the hindwing has an orange border, but there is no orange on the forewings as on the similar black hairstreak and there are two short tails, the female's longer than the male's on the hindwings.

On certain days I have seen towards 11 o'clock some numbers come down from the tree-tops to the road where they settled in the dust, not on damp places. As they could not find a firm hold, they frequently tumbled over and remained lying sideways in the sun. Otherwise singly near woods and in avenues of elm-trees.Seitz, A. Seitz, A. ed. Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) Distribution The insect has a widely disjunct distribution across the Northern Hemisphere; it is found throughout much of Europe, from Wales to the Urals, southern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, and again in Siberia, the Russian Far East, Korea, and Japan. It has not been reported from the Himalaya, despite the occurrence of four species of elm there.Kunte, K., S. Sondhi, and P. Roy (Chief Editors) 2020. Butterflies of India, v. 2.97. Indian Foundation for Butterflies. The species is also absent from North America. United Kingdom It is widely but patchily distributed across most of England; the butterfly is absent from Ireland, western Wales and most of Cornwall. In 2017, the butterfly was spotted in Scotland again after a gap of 133 years. The spread of second, far more lethal, strain of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s inevitably had a major impact on the British population, but it has since recovered well in places and is still increasing its range. To safeguard the future of this butterfly, some conservation organisations within the UK, such as the Hampshire and Isle of Wight branch of Butterfly Conservation and the Forestry Commission, have planted disease-resistant cultivars, notably .Brookes, A. H. (2020). Disease-resistant elm cultivars. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. The beetle-resistant European white elm has also been widely planted, notably by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Life cycle and food plants Eggs are laid singly, usually on the girdle scars near the terminal buds of elm trees. Unlike other hairstreak eggs, white-letter hairstreak eggs are harder to find during the winter months as they are flatter, turn brown with age, and are thus far less distinct on the twigs. Wych elm is reputedly preferred, but field elm and European white elm are also used, as are Asiatic species, notably Japanese and Siberian elm, as well as hybrid cultivars such as . The caterpillar hatches in March. Under normal circumstances, where sexually-mature trees occur, it immediately feeds on the flowers, later the seeds, before progressing to the emergent leaves in April. However, research in the Low Countries has shown that the larvae are remarkably adept at using non-flowering suckers; provided they are able to hydrate on emergence, they can survive dormant for up to six weeks, until the leaves flush. The larval stage lasts on average for 57 days, but this can vary from 37 to 78 days, depending on food availability.Bink, F., Cuvelier, S. & Russell, P.

Adults are on the wing from late June until the middle of August in the UK, where there is one brood a year. The butterflies occasionally fly down from the canopies to nectar from flowers when honeydew is unavailable, notably after heavy rains have washed it from the leaves.

The term is most commonly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, and Commonwealth countries like Canada and Australia, but it is also found in the United States.  Description  Carveries are often found in pubs and hotels, and are particularly commonly held at weekends, when they offer traditional Sunday roasts to a potentially large number of people. The meat is usually accompanied by a choice of potato (boiled, mashed and roasted), stuffing, and vegetables (commonly including carrots, parsnips, peas and other traditional British vegetables). Also provided are gravy and a sauce considered a traditional accompaniment to the various meats (for example, mint sauce to accompany roast lamb, apple sauce to accompany roast pork and so on). Examples Carveries existed as early as 1956 in London, in two Lyons Corner Houses. One of the restaurants, in each of the Strand and the Tottenham Court Road Lyons, was a carvery. They provided a three-course meal with beverage, but all but the carvery items were served by a Nippy (waitress). Even the carvery table had an employee to help those having difficulty in the actual carving. The price at this time was five shillings. In the 1970s and later, many more carveries appeared in London. One well-known carvery was situated in the Regent Palace Hotel. The restaurant there was on the ground floor, the Art Deco ceiling of which has been reassembled in the new Air W1 building. Sign of the Beefcarver restaurant, Dearborn, Michigan Later they were operated by pub chains such as Harvester, Brewer's Fayre and Beefeater. The Toby Carvery brand took over many former Beefeater sites. The chain of Fuzzy's Grub in London is a noted carvery, being voted \\"Best Traditional British Restaurant, but all but the carv in London\\" in Harden's 2007 guide. Carveries are also commonly offered by many local pubs. = United States = Some restaurants in the US use the term or concept, and it is a staple at some buffets.

Plot The entire plot consists of Alice traveling through the Alphabet as she goes along meeting new friends, or rather, creatures and obstacles. In the end, she awakes to find that not more than a few seconds have gone by and that it was all just a dream. =I: A Needle in a Haystack= The story begins with Alice busily talking to herself as she continuously tries to thread a needle through. To her dismay she continues to fail at this and she takes an extremely close look when she finds herself gliding through the air in an unknown world. She mentions how it was December at her previous whereabouts and how in Needle's Eye World it seemed to have a pleasant summer-ish feel to the place. When she finally falls to the ground she is cushioned by a haystack. When she emerges, she hears a distant call for \\"'elp\\". Alice soon discovers that they were the small whimpers of a Country Mouse, who believes that she is a comet. The Country mouse hereafter befriends Alice and informs her that she is not in a haystack, but an A-stack, or rather a messy pile of A's. She spots a few spelling bees, makes her way out of the haystack and continues in the direction of which she recalls seeing a beach from when she was flying. =II: A Tale with No End= Alice does not travel too far before she meets two cats, yet upon taking a closer look, she discovers that both are joined at the tail. Alice questions them of their breed which they reply, as they finish each other's sentences \\"We're Siamese--\\". Unknowingly, Alice interrupts and discusses how Siamese are much much different in appearance. The cats complete their statement and inform her that they were about to say Siamese-Twin Cats until she so very rudely interrupted. Alice apologizes as the cats begin to explain that one or the other is \\"as large as I am\\" or \\"as intelligent as I am\\" continuing in such a manner that their words are reduced to a mere \\"--'s I am--\\". After a short recovery from their long list, Alice decides that she will identify the cats by naming one Ping and one Pang. For if she mistakes one for the other, surely it must end up being the latter. Ping and Pang recite the poem \\"The Sands of Dee\\"; Pang forgets the last word of the poem, prompting a duel between them. The two cats instruct Alice to count twenty paces, but she mentions that she could \\"...count up to a hundred if I really tried.\\" Thus, Ping and Pang begin to step away from each other, but before their duel begins, the sky darkens and rains down cats and dogs. When the peculiar shower of animals has stopped, Ping and Pang realize that they must attend the \\"vote.\\" Alice follows them to find out what the vote is about. =III: \\"And Ninthly...\\"= The chapter opens with Alice following the Siamese Cats towards the vote. Suddenly, an Elephant rears about near her‚Äîthe Country Mouse making a short return to frighten it. Alice decides not to frighten the mouse, but at least scare it off. Hereafter, Alice and the Elephant have a conversation about being afraid of little things, the Elephant retorting \\"I suppose you aren't afraid of insects, then?\\" After their short argument, the Elephant states that they will be \\"late for the speeches.\\" Alice is then swept away by the Elephant towards the \\"Hide-and- Seek Park.\\" Here, she overhears the conversation of the Grampus and the Italian Hairdresser (She knows he is Italian because he speaks in Italics). The Emu begins its speech, but is constantly interrupted by the Crocodile, belonging to the Hairdresser, which is detained by an electric eel. Finally, the Emu finishes its speech and concludes with \\"And that's why I ask you all to vote for me!\\" In the end, after Alice inquires what he stands for, he recites a poem about the letter \\"F\\". After this, the vote transforms into an auction, and with the final cry of, \\"Going...going...gone!\\" everyone abruptly vanishes. =IV: Autobiography of a Grampus= Luckily, not everyone had vanished and Alice was left with both the Grampus and the Italian Hairdresser. The grampus promptly inquires if her name is \\"Boris\\". After a short discussion, the Grampus realizes that he has indeed written down the wrong name within his autobiography. He explains to Alice how forgetful he is, giving an example of how he sometimes \\"leaves home without an umbrella and returns with one\\". \\"This is why I have an autobiography,\\" he said. \\"So that I don't forget!\\" Both the Grampus and Alice miss the train that he wrote that they would need to get on in his autobiography. He then points out that they are to be attacked by a band of blood-thirsty brigands. After he realizes that the blood-thirsty brigands are not coming, he asks Alice to tie him up. Soon after she \\"rescues\\" him and they board the next train. As they ride the train, the Grampus begins a discussion on the meaning of words. Promptly after their discussion, the Grampus notes that he does not want to be swept away by the hurricane mentioned in his book. Alice, not wanting to \\"create\\" a hurricane, comes to the conclusion of simply writing the word 'not' into his book. The train suddenly turns into a study room and, out of curiosity, Alice ventures out to discover what might lie upon the hill she had spotted in the distance. =V: Jack and Jill= When starting to climb the hill, Alice bumps into two people, or rather, 'stick figure people'. She realizes after a short conversation, that they are Jack and Jill from the nursery rhyme. Although, they are a quite rude rendition of the two. She states that she recognized them from the rhyme which prompts Jack to 'test' her. He says \\"If you know then surely you can do this!\\" Jack then asks, or commands, Alice to recite the poem forwards, backwards, and in French. Although Alice had no intention of it, she spat out the words as if it were second nature to her. Jack then states that due to the fact that she had 'caused' them to fall, she must now carry the eels or \\"L's\\" within their bucket to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Alice sets off because she is too polite to say no in the first place. =VI: Lost-in-a-maze- ment= After a while's walk, Alice reaches a maze-like place with a sign that reads \\"Llabyrinth\\". To Alice's disappointment, she cannot get to the centre of the maze due to her childish logic of \\"If I take all lefts I'll be alright, but if I take all rights I'll be left! Left within the maze!\\". Alice comes across several confusing signs, many of which leading her back to the same place she was before. After a moment of despondency, she hears the Country Mouse; she attempts to follow it, but to no avail. She also attempts to throw one of the eels over the hedge as a signal, but fails, as it comes back like a boomerang. Eventually, she drops off to sleep. When she awakes, she sees what she assumes is a human, running past her. She follows it, and in time, arrives in the centre of the maze. After finding a large congregation of animals stuck in the middle of the maze, they attempt to go through a race for the food that the Welsh Rabbit (the one who she had followed into the centre) possesses. =VII: Alice Volunteers= In this chapter Alice is volunteered for her to go into the rabbit hole which the cluster of animals within the maze believe leads out. When going down the hole, she feels as if she is falling sideways, and describes it as an infinity sign. She contemplates things such as parallel lines meeting at infinity and how the sign looks like a tired eight. When she finally comes out, she is surprised to see where she is. =VIII: Queueing= =IX: Swan Pie and Greens= =X: You= =XI: The Battle of Letters= =XII: Was It a Dream?= Characters These are the main characters listed in order of appearance * Alice Liddell * Country Mouse * Ping * Pang * Grampus * Hairdresser * Jack * Jill * Welsh Rabbit * Otter * Kangaroo * Red Queen * White Queen * Frog Waiter * Swan * Mr. Snake * Letter Lords Connections to Wonderland There are several references and homages to Lewis Carroll's novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871).

Often referred to as the \\"sister college\\" of King's College, Lagos, it was founded on October 10, 1927, when Nigeria was still a British colony. Nigeria has a 6-3-3-4 system of education. Queen's College takes the secondary pupils in the middle two phases. There are six year groups, or grades; each year group contains about 600 students divided into several arms. Recently, class sizes have reduced to an average of 40 per class. The total population for the 2006/2007 session was 2,160 students. The school has returned the best results nationwide in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) seven times since 1985 and is widely considered to be one of the top schools on the African continent. The school motto is \\"Pass On The Torch.\\" It's one of the best female secondary School in Nigeria. Bringing out the best in Girls and girl child education. History Queen's College was established in October 10, 1927, with an enrolment of 20 students, a Principal and eight part-time teachers. Sylvia Leith-Ross was appointed \\"Lady Superintendent of Education\\" in 1925Helen Callaway, Gender, Culture and Empire: European Women in Colonial Nigeria (Springer 1986): 112. and she helped to establish Queen's College as a girl's boarding school.Barbara Bush, Imperialism, Race and Resistance: Africa and Britain, 1919-1945 (Routledge 2002): 92. Queen's College has grown to a population 3000 students, and a staff strength of well over 300 full-time teachers. Queen's College has provided education for girls in Nigeria - creating equal gender opportunities for them in professional fields. Girls are given the opportunity to pursue courses in the Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, Law, Architecture, the Arts, etc. Structure The school operates at two levels: junior and senior school. The lowest forms, JS I to JS III, make up the junior school. Students in those forms study for the Junior School Certificate Examination conducted by the National Examination Council (NECO) and taken at the end of their third year. The Senior School Examination is the goal of the students in the upper forms. Two examination bodies ‚Äì West African Examinations Council and National Examinations Council ‚Äì are each empowered to conduct separately the end-of-course examination and students are to enter for both examinations. The senior and junior schools are distinct in their operations. Each stream of JS 1 through SS 3 has about eleven classrooms with varying numbers of students. For management of both sections, the school is headed by the principal, designated PQC (Principal Queen's College) who is assisted by three vice principals: * The Vice Principal Administration * The Vice Principal Special Duties * The Vice Principal Academics Curriculum The curriculum of the school covers Science, Social Science, Arts -and vocational subjects as well as co-curricular activities. In line with the 6-3-3 4 system of education, the scope has been enlarged to give a broad-based education with subjects that can lead to courses in tertiary institutions. Staff and twelve Guidance Counselors are available to assist students in learning, in their choice of career, social adjustment, as well as their welfare. Subjects offered in both Junior and Senior schools are: * English Language, Literature-in-English, History * Mathematics, Further mathematics * Social Studies, Geography * Integrated Science (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) * French Language * Business Studies, Economics, Commerce, Accounting * Introductory Technology * Christian Religious Studies/Islamic Religious Studies * Nigerian language - Yoruba/Hausa/Igbo Languages * Agric/PHE * Arabic * Music/Fine art * Home Economics * Typewriting * Computer Studies * Government * Trading * Insurance/Book -keeping * Home economics/Food And Nutrition/Clothing And Textile. The girls are involved in games and sports. The annual inter-house sports competition is usually held during the second term of the academic session. The school has six houses that compete in the inter-house games, namely Dan-Fodio (Red House), Obasa (Blue House), Obi (Yellow House), Emotan (Green House), Efunjoke (Purple House) and Obong (Orange House).

The combination of laser light and an electrical arc into an amalgamated welding process has existed since the 1970s, but has only recently been used in industrial applications. There are three main types of hybrid welding process, depending on the arc used: TIG, plasma arc or MIG augmented laser welding. While TIG-augmented laser welding was the first to be researched, MIG is the first to go into industry and is commonly known as hybrid laser welding. Whereas in the early days laser sources still had to prove their suitability for industrial use, today they are standard equipment in many manufacturing enterprises. The combination of laser welding with another weld process is called a \\"hybrid welding process\\". This means that a laser beam and an electrical arc act simultaneously in one welding zone, influencing and supporting each other.  Laser  Laser welding not only requires high laser power but also a high quality beam to obtain the desired \\"deep-weld effect\\". The resulting higher quality of beam can be exploited either to obtain a smaller focus diameter or a larger focal distance. A variety of laser types are used for this process, in particular Nd:YAG where the laser light can be transmitted via a water-cooled glass fiber. The beam is projected onto the workpiece by collimating and focusing optics. Carbon dioxide laser can also be used where the beam is transmitted via lens or mirrors.  Laser-hybrid process  For welding metallic objects, the laser beam is focused to obtain intensities of more than 1 MW/cm2. When the laser beam hits the surface of the material, this spot is heated up to vaporization temperature, and a vapor cavity is formed in the weld metal due to the escaping metal vapor. This is known as a keyhole. The extraordinary feature of the weld seam is its high depth-to-width ratio. The energy-flow density of the freely burning arc is slightly more than 100 kW/cm2. Unlike a dual process where two separate weld processes act in succession, hybrid welding may be viewed as a combination of both weld processes acting simultaneously in one and the same process zone. Depending on the kind of arc or laser process used, and depending on the process parameters, the two systems will influence each other in different ways. The combination of the laser process and the arc process results in an increase in both weld penetration depth and welding speed (as compared to each process alone). The metal vapor escaping from the vapor cavity acts upon the arc plasma. Absorption of the laser radiation in the processing plasma remains negligible. Depending on the ratio of the two power inputs, the character of the overall process may be mainly determined either by the laser or by the arc. Absorption of the laser radiation is substantially influenced by the temperature of the workpiece surface. Before the laser welding process can start, the initial reflectance must be overcome, especially on aluminum surfaces. This can be achieved by preheating the material. In the hybrid process, the arc heats the metal, helping the laser beam to couple in. After the vaporisation temperature has been reached, the vapor cavity is formed, and nearly all radiation energy can be put into the workpiece. The energy required for this is thus determined by the temperature-dependent absorption and by the amount of energy lost by conduction into the rest of the workpiece. In laser-hybrid welding, using MIG, vaporisation takes place not only from the surface of the workpiece but also from the filler wire, so that more metal vapor is available to facilitate the absorption of the laser radiation.  Fatigue behavior  Over the years a great deal of research has been done to understand fatigue behavior, particularly for new techniques like laser-hybrid welding, but knowledge is still limited. Laser-hybrid welding is an advanced welding technology that creates narrow deep welds and offers greater freedom to control the weld surface geometry. Therefore, fatigue analysis and life prediction of hybrid weld joints has become more important and is the subject of ongoing research.

They are distinguished from other subspecies by more orange present on the flank and orange raised stripe present from the eye to the shoulder. The subspecies is normally one solid colour on the dorsal surface. = Eastern banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii grayi = This subspecies occurs along the coast of New South Wales, south to Jervis Bay. It inhabits coastal swamps, dams, ponds associated with forest and heathland. This species does not breed in flowing water, which helps with distinguishing it from L. d. dumerilii in places where both occur. This is the most variegated of the subspecies, often with patches or blotches of a different colour on the dorsal surface. The call of this species sounds more like a \\"tok\\", similar but louder than the striped marsh frog. = Snowy Mountains banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii fryi = This is the most restricted of the subspecies. It is only found in the Snowy Mountains area of south-eastern New South Wales. Males call from ponds or pools of streams in spring and summer. Due to its restricted range it is unlikely to be confused with other subspecies, however it is pale on the dorsal surface with fairly indistinct patches or variegations. = Southern banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii insularis = This subspecies occurs south of Jervis Bay, along the south coast of New South Wales, in eastern Victoria and throughout Tasmania. It is characterised and distinguished by blue coloration present on the flank. There is often a pale mid-dorsal stripe. Males call from a concealed position in water during spring, summer and autumn. = Southern banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii variegata = This subspecies is very similar to Limnodynastes dumerilii insularis. This subspecies occurs in western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It is chiefly distinguished by range.  Ecology and behaviour  The eastern banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii grayi The southern banjo frog, Limnodynastes dumerilii insularis Limnodynastes dumerilii is a burrowing frog. During dry times, and often just during the day, they will burrow underground. They will often be seen in large numbers after rain, and under the right conditions mass spawning can occur over just a few days. They have been known to call while underground, and can do so at any time of the year after rain.  Related species  In Western Australia the western banjo frog, Limnodynastes dorsalis, is common around Perth. It also has a musical, resonant \\"plonk\\" call and is also called a pobblebonk. In Queensland, the scarlet-sided pobblebonk, Limnodynastes terraereginae, is a small fat frog with distinctive orange or red irregular markings. In Western New South Wales, the giant banjo frog, Limnodynastes interioris, is a similar species that tends to inhabit more arid areas than Limnodynastes dumerilii.

It was written by Linda Bloodworth and Mary Kay Place and directed by Hy Averback. The guest cast includes Shizuko Hoshi as Rosie, Jeff Maxwell as Private Igor Straminsky, Bobbie Mitchell as Nurse Baker, Michael O'Keefe as Corporal Travis, and Arthur Song as Korean Man. Overview A stray dog bites Radar and the 4077th must find it soon or he must begin painful and dangerous vaccinations against rabies. Meanwhile, Pierce is trying to treat a patient with hysterical paralysis. Detailed story Radar is feeding his animals World War II surplus powdered milk from a surgical glove when Lieutenant Colonel Blake walks up after having just taken a shower. Blake gives Radar back his pet turtle, which he found in the shower. Radar then interrupts Pierce, who is making out with Nurse Baker, so that he can sign a patient's release form. While signing the form, Pierce notices a scratch on Radar's hand. Radar tells him that a mutt that sticks around the camp bit him. Pierce then informs Radar that rabies and dysentery are two of the most prevalent diseases in Korea, and that the dog needs to be tested to see if it is a carrier. Orderlies are unloading wounded soldiers from a bus, but Major Burns tells them not to unload one particular soldier because he is not physically wounded and needs to be treated in Tokyo for shell shock. Pierce and McIntyre insist that he be treated at the 4077th against Burns' orders. In the recovery room, Pierce finds out that the soldier, Corporal Travis, was in a fox hole when tanks attacked his unit. He lost consciousness, and when he came to, he couldn't move. Pierce then calls Dr. Sidney Freedman to ask him to come to the 4077th to treat Corporal Travis. Dr. Freedman tells Pierce that he is too busy and recommends a course of action that Pierce should follow. Pierce goes back into the recovery room where Major Houlihan complains to him about the fact that her nurses are having to constantly clean up Corporal Travis because Pierce has ordered that he is not to use a bedpan, but must walk to the latrine. Corporal Travis thinks that Pierce is being overly cruel, but Pierce is following Dr. Freedman's advice by trying to convince him that nothing is physically wrong with his legs. Radar and Blake are out looking for the dog when they run into Rosie. They ask Rosie if they've seen the dog, and Rosie, in turn, asks a Korean man, who tells Rosie that the dog was delicious. Radar panics until they ask the old man if the dog had a collar, and the man says no, which means that it was not Radar's dog. But, until it is found, Radar must begin the vaccination process. Major Houlihan tries to comfort Radar after he is given his first dose of the vaccine. She tells him that he has a letter from a young lady and asks if he would like her to read it to him. He says that he would. The letter is from a 17-year-old girl from the United States who got his name from the Red Cross. She tells him a little bit about herself and asks a few questions about him. Radar falls asleep by the time Major Houlihan finishes the letter. Majors Burns and Houlihan complain to Colonel Blake about Corporal Travis having to crawl to the mess tent to eat. Pierce defends his actions as following the recommendations of Dr. Freedman and that, by sending him home, his guilt will only serve to reinforce his hysterical paralysis. Finally, Corporal Travis opens up to Trapper John. Blake, looking in on Radar's pets, spots the dog that bit Radar. He and McIntyre chase it all over camp. After they catch it, they determine that it doesn't have rabies, so Radar can stop the treatments. During a meeting of all the doctors in Blake's office and Major Houlihan, Corporal Travis walks in under his own power to prove Pierce and Dr. Freedman were right.

History The first Fremantle railway station, 1881 A series train at Platform 3 in December 2005 The original Fremantle station opened in Cliff Street on 1 March 1881 as the terminus of the Eastern Railway to Guildford via Perth. As the Eastern Railway was extended its importance grew, becoming an important hub for gold miners arriving in Western Australia via ship and then travelling to the Yilgarn and Eastern Goldfields when the line opened to Kalgoorlie in 1896. In 1907, a new station and marshalling yards were established 300 metres to the north-east on the site of the former Fremantle Railway Workshops to better service the newly constructed Fremantle Harbour.Conserving Fremantle Railway Station for Future Generations Public Transport AuthorityHistory of Stations on the Fremantle Line Right Track The station was designed by William Dartnall, Chief Engineer of Existing Lines of the Railway Department in 1905. The construction contract, at an estimated cost of ‚Ç§80,000, was awarded in May 1906 to S.B. Alexander and completed on 20 April 1907, with the official opening on 1 July 1907. Originally, the station had three 150 metre platforms, one side and one island, with a subway connection and an overall roof. This had been taken out of use by the 1960s and was later demolished. Until the 1960s, passenger services continued south of Fremantle to Kwinana. A signal cabin was relocated from the eastern end of the platform to the Bennett Brook Railway in 1985.\\"Bennett Brook Railway\\" Railway Digest September 1999 page 43 The station closed on 1 September 1979 along with the rest of the Fremantle line.

Schedule On July 1, 2013, Here and Now began broadcasting as a two-hour program with a \\"full rollover\\" (meaning the show broadcasts from noon to 4 p.m. ET) airing Monday to Friday and generally in the midday hours on its affiliate stations. The show covers U.S. and international news, and provides arts and culture coverage. Here and Now has three cutaways for newscasts: one from :04:00 to :06:00 past the hour, occupying a portion of the national five- minute newscast from NPR, and two one-minute summaries of national news headlines at 0:18:00 and 0:38:00 past the hour, produced and anchored in-house at WBUR. History Here and Now first began airing in 1998, when it was co- hosted by Tovia Smith and Bruce Gellerman. At the time, the show was billed as a local or regional current affairs show, concentrating on newsworthy events throughout the six New England states. The show expanded to include national and international elements, its current format, soon after. Host Robin Young joined the show in 2000, replacing Smith, and outlasted a series of co-hosts, including founding co-host and executive producer Gellerman. In 2005, WBUR had announced that the show would return to its roots as a local current affairs program, but a national distribution deal with PRI changed that plan. The cancellation of NPR's midday newsmagazine Day to Day in March 2009 left a gap in public radio's programming day. News-heavy stations in some markets opted to pick up Here and Now as the replacement. Building on that philosophy, on March 29, 2013, NPR and WBUR announced that call-in show Talk of the Nation would cease production and NPR would replace it with a two-hour version of Here and Now. The reported reason for the change was a desire of bigger NPR member stations to have a midday magazine-style news show acting as a bridge between network stalwarts Morning Edition and All Things Considered. The expanded version of Here and Now debuted on July 1, 2013, with Jeremy Hobson as a second host. Tonya Mosley became a co-host in 2019, while Jeremy Hobson left in October of 2020.

The mountain is situated in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park. At above sea level, it is within the top thirty highest mountains in Tasmania. Location The mountain lies east of the West Coast Range, yet due to its prominence, it can be seen from Macquarie Harbour.see picture below titled Frenchman from Sarah, with description ‚Äì View from Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour with Frenchmans Cap on the eastern skyline It lies south of the Lyell Highway from which it can be viewed from various locations, and south west of Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. The peaks of the Frenchmans area include Frenchmans Cap (), Clytemnestra and Philps Peak (both ), and Philps Ridge (). Etymology The mountain lies in the traditional lands of the Aboriginal Tasmanians, most likely the Toogee nation. The traditional names for Frenchmans Cap are trullenuer (trul.len.neur), toindy (toin.dy) or mebbelek. Even though the peak was an early landmark for ships sailing the west coast, the first recorded use of Frenchmans Cap was in 1822 in connection with Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, from where the peak was visible. The origin of the name is attributed to its appearance from some angles as looking like a Frenchman's cap, notably the Liberty cap worn during the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799). A variation of that was reported by Henry Widdowson, who wrote in 1829 that the name was derived from \\"its generally being covered with snow and bearing some resemblance to the shape of dress which invariably adorns the head of a French Cook\\". History Frenchmans Cap, March 2016 The distinctive shape of the mountain was used as a guiding beacon by many, largely unsuccessful, parties of escaping convicts as they attempted to struggle through the dense scrub of Western Tasmania to the settled districts further east. It was mentioned as a geographical reference in the account later dictated by convict Alexander Pearce to authorities, following his capture. The earliest European recorded to have ascended was James Sprent and his trigonometrical party in 1853.Although not specifically referring directly to the triangulation conducted by Sprent on Frenchmans, it is a discussion of his work in the task ‚Äì In 1941 the Frenchmans Cap National Park was created and its boundary was in effect the Franklin River. This park was subsumed into the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park in the 1990s. The country around the mountain is invariably referred to by the books and the material written about the Franklin River. Johnson Dean's book gives a graphic account with maps and pictures the nature of the country. Access Access to the mountain is usually via a multiday bushwalk from the Lyell Highway. Parks and Wildlife Service and other authorities in Tasmania give advice about the access and preparation needed ‚Äì due to the changing conditions of the area. The track is repeatedly overgrown, due to the vegetation and the rainfall of the area. The walk to the peak along the well marked track typically takes two days. The first day of about will bring walkers to Lake Vera Hut. Water is plentiful (and drinkable) in all seasons. Walk time from Lyell Highway to Lake Vera is between six and eight hours. This part of the walk was historically very difficult, including two steep and prolonged ascents separated by the boggy Loddon Plains. The so-called \\"Sodden Loddons\\" were almost always muddy and crossing them took two hours or more. In wet weather the mud was frequently waist high, while in the dry it was only knee high. However, since 2013 track upgrades have seen the North Loddon Planes duckboarded, and the trail diverted around the South Loddon Plains through Philps Lead. This has allowed for significant environmental rejuvenation and reduced the difficulty of the first day. It was financed by donations from Dick Smith after he visited and was dismayed with the state of the trail. The second day's walk is shorter at , but steeper. After walking along the shores of Lake Vera the next two hours are spent struggling up the steep inclines to Barron Pass. Once on top the walker is presented with a dramatic view of Frenchmans Cap. From Barron Pass it is approximately another two hours to Tahune Hut, depending on fitness and pack weight. Water is again available along the way. Walk time from Lake Vera to Lake Tahune is about four hours. There are two lakes on the way to the summit ‚Äì Lake Vera, and Lake Tahune ‚Äì there are huts at both of these locations. Lake Vera Hut was built in 1979 and sleeps 20 people in two two- tier bunk configurations. It is heated by a stove using brickette fuel (similar to heat beads in BBQs). The original Lake Tahune Hut was built in 1971 and slept 16 people snugly, also in two two-tier bunks and was heated by a brickette fuel stove. The hut was redeveloped in 2018, expanding it to sleep 24 people while adding deck room and an environmentally sustainable heater. At Tahune, the steep walker's track to the top of the Cap takes under an hour. If the weather is clear the view includes the West Coast beaches, Lake Burbury and the many peaks ‚Äì such as Tasmania's tallest, Mount Ossa ‚Äì in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. The plus walk to Frenchmans Cap is typically completed as a return trip on the same track. =Alternative access= There is an option to make it a round trip by walking on from Lake Tahune to the Franklin River at Irenabyss, crossing the river and exiting at Victoria Pass, which is also on the Lyell Highway. The walk from Irenabyss to Victoria Pass traverses rugged country and is recommended only for highly experienced parties. Many parties visit Irenabyss as a long day walk. Lake Tahune to Irenabyss takes about 4 hours. Irenabyss to Victoria Pass takes about 12 hours. Climbing For climbers, Frenchmans Cap offers a variety of trad routes on generally sound, quartzite rock. In keeping with the name of the mountain some of these climbs also have French names including A Toi La Gloire (better known as The Sydney Route), a , 13-pitch, grade 17 climb on the south-east face and Tierry Le Fronde, a , six-pitch, grade 16 climb on the Tahune Face. Serious climbing has occurred since the 1960s, as detailed in a 1990 article in Rock by Stephen Bunton.

The agents from this heterogeneous group have an effect on the repolarization, they prolong the duration of the action potential and the refractory period. Also they slow down the spontaneous discharge frequency of automatic pacemakers by depressing the slope of diastolic depolarization. They shift the threshold towards zero or hyperpolarize the membrane potential. Although each agent has its own properties and will have thus a different function.  Heart potential  Azimilide dihydrochloride is a chlorophenylfuranyl compound, which slows repolarization of the heart and prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Prolongation of atrial or ventricular repolarization can provide an anti-arrhythmic benefit in patients with heart rhythm disturbances, and this has been the primary interest in the clinical development azimilide. In rare cases, excessive prolongation of ventricular repolarization by azimilide can result in predisposition towards severe ventricular arrhythmias. Most recent clinical trials have investigated the use of azimilide in reducing the frequency and severity of arrhythmias in patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers-defibrillators, where rare pro- arrhythmic events are rescued by the device. Image:Heartpotential.jpg  The ion currents  The action of azimilide is directed to the different currents present in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. It principally blocks IKr, and IKs, with much weaker effects on INa, ICa, INCX and IK.Ach. The IKr(rapid)and IKs (slow) are inward rectifier potassium currents, responsible for repolarizing cardiac myocytes towards the end of the cardiac action potential. A somewhat higher concentration of azimilide is needed to block the IKs current. Both blockages result in an increase of the QT interval and a prolongation of atrial and ventricular refractory periods. Azimilide blocks hERG channels (which encode the IKr current) with an affinity comparable to that with which KvLQT1 / minK channels (which encode the IKs current) are blocked. This block exhibits reverse use-dependence, i.e. the channel blocking effect wanes at faster pulsing rates of the cell. A possible explanation is an interaction of azimilide with K+ close to its binding site in the ion channel. However, there is an agonist effect as well, which is a voltage-dependent effect. This is a dual effect, a low voltage depolarization near the activation threshold will increase the current amplitude and higher depolarizing voltages will suppress the current amplitude. The effect comes from outside of the cell membrane and does not depend on G-proteins or kinase activity inside the cell. Azimilide binds on the extracellular domain of the hERG channel, this propagates a conformational change and inhbits the current. This change makes the activation gate open more easily by low voltage depolarization. Azimilide has two separate binding sites in hERG channel, one for its antagonist function and the other for the agonist function. Pharmacology Azimilide has been studied for its anti-arrhythmic effects: its converts and maintains sinus rhythm in patients with atrial arrhythmias; and it reduces the frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators. Azimilide's most important adverse effect is torsades de pointes, which is a form of ventricular tachycardia. Pharmacokinetics The drug is administered orally and will be completely absorbed. It shows none or very minor interactions with other drugs and it will be eventually cleared by the kidney. A peak in concentration in the blood is observed seven hours after the administration of Azimilide. The metabolic clearance is mediated through several pathways: * 10% is found unchanged in the blood * 30% will cleared by cleavage * 25% by CYP 1A1 pathway * 25% by CYP 3A4 F-1292 is the major metabolite of azimilide, it is formed cleavage of the aromethine bond. Unlike desmethyl azimilide, azimilide N-oxide and azimilide carboxylate F-1292 has no cardiovascular activity while the other three minor metabolites have a class ŒôŒôŒô antiarrhythmic activity. They only make out 10% of azimilde in the blood, so their contribution is not measurable. This use of azimilide is very controversial subject, but this article will give only the plain scientific information about this drug.

The apolytikion summarizes the feast being celebrated that day. It is chanted at Vespers, Matins and the Divine Liturgy; and it is read at each of the Little Hours. The name derives from the fact that it is chanted for the first time before the dismissal (Greek: apolysis) of the first service of the liturgical day, Vespers, the liturgical day beginning at sunset in the Orthodox Church. Although the term apolytikion is used in the Greek language, there is no equivalent word in Church Slavonic where variously are used such terms as \\"–æ—Ç–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–æ–ø–∞—Ä—å\\" (dismissal troparion), \\"—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–∞—Ä—å –ø—Ä–∞–∑–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞\\" (troparion of the feast), \\"—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–∞—Ä—å —Å–≤—è—Ç–æ–≥–æ\\" (troparion of the saint), and so on. The apolytikion could be compared in the Western liturgy to the collect or post- communion, inasmuch as it changes for each feast-day of the year and specifically commemorates the subject of the feast, although those Western equivalents are only used at Mass.

In the , Kuranda had a population of 3,008 people. It is from Cairns, via the Kuranda Range road. It is surrounded by tropical rainforest and adjacent to the Wet Tropics World Heritage listed Barron Gorge National Park. The town of Myola is also located within the locality of Kuranda (). Geography Kuranda is positioned on the eastern edge of the Atherton Tableland where the Barron River begins a steep descent to its coastal floodplain. The area is an important wildlife corridor between the Daintree/Carbine Tableland area in the north and Lamb Range/Atherton Tableland in the south, two centres of biodiversity. Parts of Kuranda, particularly along its eastern edge, are protected within the Kuranda National Park and Barron Gorge National Park. Both national parks belong to the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Barron Gorge Forest Reserve and Formatine Forest Reserve have been established in the south of Kuranda. Closer to the centre of the town is Jumrum Creek Conservation Park where a near threatened, endemic frog species is protected. An elongated dam created by a weir built for a power station was constructed in 1935 and is used to today for recreation. History Kuranda Hotel, ~1928 The rainforest around Kuranda has been home to the Djabugay people for over 10,000 years. Europeans began to explore the area throughout the nineteenth century. It is believed a massacre of Aboriginal people took place at the location in Kuranda known as Skeleton Creek. The name Kuranda is derived from Yindinji word, kuran referring to the acorn leafed plant (Helmholtzia acorifolia). Djabugay (also knowen as Djabuganjdji, Tjupakai) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around the Kuranda Range and Barron River Catchment. The Djabugay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cairns Regional Council. The name Myola comes from its railway station, which was named on 15 December 1891 by the Queensland Railways Department using an Aboriginal word indicating main camp or elders' camp. Kuranda was first settled in 1885 and surveyed by Thomas Behan in 1888. Construction of the railway from Cairns to Myola (later Cairns to Herberton) began in 1887 and the line reached Kuranda in 1891. The current railway station was completed in 1915. Kuranda Post Office opened on 25 June 1891 (a Middle Crossing receiving office had been open from 1888). Kuranda State School opened on 24 October 1892. It was renamed Kuranda District State School on 8 July 2002. Between 1912 and 1913 Eric Mj√∂berg lead an expedition to Queensland in which the Kuranda Aboriginal people were observed. Although coffee was grown around Kuranda in the early twentieth century, timber was the town's primary industry for a number of years. Kuranda has been known as a tourist destination since the early 1900s. It was both the rainforest and local Aboriginal culture which attracted people to the area. St Saviour's Anglican Church was built in 1915.Christopher Wright: Saint Saviour's Church Kuranda - History and Guide, S. 5. Kuranda 2018 Its colourful glass windows were added in 2002. Clohesy River Provisional School opened on 21 August 1933 and closed in 1939. The Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station was built nearby in the 1960s. From the 1970s onwards, Kuranda promoted itself as the 'village in the rainforest'. The concept served two purposes. It attracted those seeking a bohemian enclave in which to reside as well as a being a tourist promotional strategy. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Kuranda was popular with alternative lifestylers, a theme that still runs through the local community today. Tourism became the backbone of the local economy. Kuranda Library opened in 1996 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2015. Kuranda State High School opened on 22 January 1998. In 2007 Kuranda District State School and Kuranda State High School amalgamated to form Kuranda District State College. Although historically and currently Kuranda is in the Shire of Mareeba, following a rationalisation of local government areas, between 2008 and 2013 all of the Shire of Mareeba was within the Tablelands Region. This unpopular decision was reversed with the reinstatement of the Shire of Mareeba in 2014. In the , the locality of Kuranda had a population of 2,966. In the , the locality f Kuranda had a population of 3,008 people.

A popular day trip from Cairns is the combined railway-and-cableway round trip to Kuranda. Coondoo Street is Kuranda's main street with shops, galleries and various old and shadowy trees. St. Saviour's Anglican Church at 7 Coondoo Street () is known for its colourful glass windows. The gardens surrounding St Christopher's Catholic Church in Barang Street and the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Barron Falls Road are good locations to observe tropical birds. In the northern part of Kuranda close to Therwine Street a Japanese plane wreck can be seen in the bushes.

Education  Kuranda District State College is a government primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at 260 Myola Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 366 students with 37 teachers (33 full-time equivalent) and 32 non-teaching staff (21 full-time equivalent). It has a special education program. Cairns Hinterland Steiner School is a private primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at 46 Boyles Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 165 students with 18 teachers (17 full-time equivalent) and 17 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent). Fauna The nocturnal frog species Litoria myola is only found in the vicinity of a few creeks near Kuranda. The area boasts a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna including Australia's largest species of mantids, phasmids, spiders, moths and butterflies all found in Kuranda. Weather Being situated in the tropics, Kuranda experiences only mild variations in temperature and its seasons consist of a dry season and a wet season. Kuranda does not seem to have a dedicated weather station and resultant data feed. It appears that phone and weather apps default to Cairns data and so can be misleading. Generally Kuranda is 2‚Äì5 ¬∞C cooler than Cairns, it has more rainy days as a result of orographic influences, and it is more humid generally (with residential areas in Kuranda village averaging 90% relative humidity, because of the surrounding rain-forest). Kuranda is often referred to the \\"air conditioned suburb of Cairns\\" and the rain-forest and elevation is responsible in part for these perceptions. It is rare for the temperature to exceed 31 ¬∞C in summer, the weather being moderated by rain and cloud cover in January to March (the wet season), and night minimums at this time of year similarly rarely drop below 20 ¬∞C. Winter maximums (June to August) are typically a consistent 25 ¬∞C; however, minimums can drop to 8 ¬∞C, owing to clear skies at this time of year and cooler air movements originating from the southern Atherton Tablelands. Government Kuranda is located in the (federal) Australian House of Representatives Division of Leichhardt, the Legislative Assembly of Queensland Electoral district of Barron River and locally, in the Shire of Mareeba.

Early life She was a slave in the possession of Abu Hudhaifah ibn al-Mughirah, a member of the Makhzum clan in Mecca.Muhammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk.

Her master gave her in marriage to Yasir ibn Amir, who was from the Malik clan of the Madh'hij tribe in Yemen. After coming to Mecca to look for a lost brother, he had decided to settle there under Abu Hudhayfa's protection. Sumayyah gave birth to their son Ammar c.566.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). The Companions of Badr, p. 203. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. \\"Ammar was killed in Safar 37 AH at the age of 93.\\" Yasir also had two brothers, Hurth and Abdullah, At a later date, Abu Hudhayfa freed both Sumayyah and her son Ammar; but they remained his clients for the rest of his life.Muir, W. (1861). The Life of Mahomet, vol. 2, p. 125. London: Smith, Elder & Co. It is said that Abu Hudhayfa died \\"before Islam\\"; but it is also said that he was \\"one of those who mocked the Prophet\\". Conversion to Islam According to one tradition, Sumayyah was one of the first seven \\"to display Islam,\\" the other six being Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Bilal, Khabbab, Suhayb and her son Ammar. \\"To display Islam\\" might refer to something other than conversion since, according to another tradition, Ammar was not converted until after the Muslims had entered the house of al-Arqam \\"after thirty men\\". Yasir and his son Abdullah were also converted \\"on the rise of Islam,\\" but Hurth had been killed by the Dil clan before 610. The Quraysh persecuted Muslims of low social rank.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Sumayyah's family was vulnerable after the death of their patron, and it was other members of the Makhzum clan who tortured them to pressure them to abandon their faith. On one occasion she was put inside a pitcher full of water and lifted so that she could not escape. She, Yasir and Ammar were also forced to stand in the sun in the heat of the day dressed in mail-coats. Although described as \\"a very old and frail woman,\\" Sumayyah remained steadfast and refused to abandon Islam. Death One evening Abu Jahl, also a member of the Makhzum clan, came to watch her standing there and he began to insult her verbally. Then he killed her by stabbing and impaling her with his spear. When Abu Jahl was killed at Badr, Muhammad said to Ammar, \\"Allah has killed your mother's killer.\\" Tabari mentions an alternative account of Sumayyah's life. He says she married a Byzantine slave named Azraq after Yasir's death. She bore him a son named Salamah and their bloodline eventually married into the Umayyad family. Tabari also notes some stories as a case of possible confusion between two Meccan women named Sumayyah.History of al- Tabari Vol. 39, The: Biographies of the Prophet's Companions p.29-30, SUNY Press, 07-Jul-2015, Historical references The earliest reference to the murder of Sumayyah is found in Ibn Ishaq's (died 761)Robinson 2003, p. xv biography of Muhammad, Siratu Rasulullah (\\"Biography of the Messenger of God\\").University of Wisconsin-Madison Her name Sumayyah is not explicitly mentioned in Ibn Ishaq; it is a deduction from the reference to her son as Ammar \\"son of\\" Sumayya.

The actual composition of these sublemas can vary: it can be simply a pair of candidates (for election to the posts of governor and vice-governor, for example), or an ordered list of candidates to fill the seats in a legislative body. *Each party can present several sublemas to the main election. *The winning party is the one which receives the most votes after the votes won by each of its sublemas have been added together. Within this party, the winning sublema is the one which, individually, won the most votes. Once the number of votes received by each lema and sublema has been determined, seats or posts are allocated to each proportionally, typically using a system such as the d'Hondt method.  History and use  The Lemas system was designed in 1870 by the Belgian professor Charles Borelli. =Uruguay= Lemas were introduced in Uruguay in the early 20th century when the \\"Lema law\\" introduced double simultaneous voting.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II, p488 It allowed for the election of the President, Chamber of Deputies and Senate by casting a single vote. Parties acted as lemas, while party factions formed sublemas.Nohlen, p491 Voters would vote for a sublema of a party, with the totals of sublemas totalled to establish the winning party. During periods in which a presidential system was enacted (as opposed to the collegiado system that operated between 1918 and 1933 and 1951 and 1966), the presidential candidate of the sublema in the winning party with the most votes would become president. This system was abolished for presidential elections after constitutional reforms were passed in a 1996 referendum, restricting each party to a single presidential candidate.Nohlen, p490 Department elections still use the old system. The parliamentary and department elections still use double simultaneous voting. =Honduras= Honduras applied the Ley de Lemas in the 1985 presidential election, when, due to factionalism within the two dominant parties, both were unable to elect a single presidential candidate. =Argentina= In Argentina, a number of provinces employ or have employed a version of this electoral system. Currently, this law is in the provinces of Formosa, Misiones and Santa Cruz. Provinces have complete freedom to elect local and national representatives using the method of their choice; the system propagates down to the municipal level (except in the hypothetical case of autonomous cities). The lemas system has never been used in Argentina for a presidential election, though the idea was circulated before the 2003 election. In the wake of Fernando de la R√∫a's resignation in the wake of the 2001 riots, original plans called for a permanent successor to be elected in 2002 under the lemas system.  Support  The Ley de Lemas presents itself as a solution to the problem of fiat selection of candidates performed behind closed doors by party factions. By allowing many candidates to run within the same party and leaving the decision to the citizenry, the system is supposed to end the practice of dark intra- party alliances and add transparency to the conflicts between internal factions. This helps the participation of independent candidates without support from powerful party figures. It also avoids primary elections (which, in the case of Argentina, had never been practiced widely during the 20th century and typically enjoyed very low voter turnout).  Criticism  The party-list proportional representation system works under the assumption that the citizens vote primarily for parties. However, citizens often place emphasis on individual candidates rather than the parties' perceived ideological platforms. (This is especially true of Argentina.) The diversity of views allowed within a single party means that voters may end up indirectly giving their vote to a candidate that the voters do not really support. A party that decides to present multiple candidates, either with similar or opposing ideologies, may win even if the elected candidate had few votes compared with all the other candidates. For example, in the 1971 Uruguayan presidential election, Juan Maria Bordaberry won the presidency despite finishing over 60,000 votes behind Wilson Ferreira Aldunate. However, in that election, candidates from Bordaberry's Colorado Party won 12,000 more votes between them than the candidates from Aldunate's National Party. Also, proportional representation system are intended for multiple winnersfor example, candidates to fill a legislative chamberbut the Ley de Lemas has been used to elect single winners (presidents, governors and mayors).

It currently airs on WTVR in the Richmond area, and WTKR in Hampton Roads. The current show began in Richmond in 1975, and it originally aired on a local PBS member station until it was canceled by the station. Its 2002‚Äì2003 season was aired on a public-access television cable TV station, before the Richmond CBS affiliate added the show, where it currently airs on Saturday mornings at 10:00 A.M. The Hampton Roads program began with the 2004-2005 season, formerly airing on WAVY-TV. As of the 2017-18 season, it airs on WTKR at 11:00 A.M. Since the early 2000s, the team to beat in the competition has been the Maggie L. Walker Governor's School in Richmond, although the 2012 champion was Charlottesville High School. Ocean Lakes High School of Virginia Beach is the reigning Hampton Roads area champion. The show currently matches the Richmond-area winner against the Hampton Roads-area winner in a game called the ‚ÄúChampion‚Äôs Challenge‚Äù. Charlottesville High School is the reigning champion. Also, the 2003-2004 season marked the first time an All-Star game was held from the top individual players representing themselves. The first All-Star game featured eight players from seven different schools, while the second game had eight from six schools. Beginning with the 2007-2008 season, high schools from Northeastern North Carolina were allowed to compete in the Hampton Roads show. The show is hosted by WTVR's Cheryl Miller. The Hampton Roads show was hosted by WAVY's Stephanie Harris when it aired on that station. Since the move to WTKR, the Richmond version airs in both markets.

The team currently fields two Holden ZB Commodores in the Supercars Championship for Bryce Fullwood and Chaz Mostert, along with a Porsche 911 GT3-R in the Australian GT Championship. Formed in 1990 as the Holden Racing Team, it is one of the most successful Supercars Championship teams in the history of the category, having won the drivers' championship six times, and the series' signature race, the Bathurst 1000, seven times. In 2017, the Holden Racing Team name was transferred by Holden to Triple Eight Race Engineering and the team was renamed Mobil 1 HSV Racing. For the 2018 season, the team was rebranded Walkinshaw Andretti United, as Andretti Autosport and United Autosports become shareholders. 1980s Holden Racing Team logo As part of the joint venture established in 1987 between Tom Walkinshaw and Holden to form Holden Special Vehicles, Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) was to run Holden's motor sport programme. TWR were responsible for designing the Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV, which was homologated for racing in August 1988 after Holden Special Vehicles completed the required 500. For 1988 it was decided to contract out the racing programme to Perkins Engineering although a car built by TWR in England was raced by Tom Walkinshaw at the RAC Tourist Trophy and Bathurst 1000. For 1989 it was planned for TWR to run the full season with two cars. Win Percy and Neil Crompton were announced as the team's drivers and a second VL Commodore built in England was tested in Holden Racing Team livery at Calder but with the likelihood of being mauled by the Ford Sierra RS500s, the Australian Touring Car Championship programme was cancelled. For the Sandown 500, Bathurst 1000 and Grand Prix support races, the programme was once again contracted to Perkins Engineering. 1990s =1990= The 1990 Bathurst 1000 winning VL Commodore. In 1990 the operation was brought in house with longtime TWR driver Win Percy moving to Melbourne to fill the role of both driver and team manager. Percy drove at all Australian Touring Car Championship rounds except for Mallala where Neil Crompton drove after Percy returned to England for a family bereavement.Nissan's First, 1990 Shell Australian Touring Car Championship, Australian Motor Racing Year 1990/91, pages 108‚Äì109 Percy's highest qualifying position was sixth at Winton and highest race result a third place at Lakeside, and he finished eighth overall in the championship. At the Sandown 500, Percy and Crompton qualified the car fourth, however did not finish the race. For the Bathurst 1000 the team entered two cars with Percy, against the wishes of Holden and Tom Walkinshaw, recruiting Allan Grice to co-drive the lead car. Crompton was joined by Brad Jones. With Percy suffering a shoulder injury, his decision to hire Grice was vindicated with the latter handling the bulk of the driving on the way to an unexpected victory, the second car finished fifth. =1991= For 1991 the VN Commodore was homologated with Win Percy driving in all ATCC rounds except Lakeside where Allan Grice substituted while Percy competed in an event in Europe. Percy again finished eighth in the championship. At the Bathurst 1000, Percy and Grice teamed together to finish second, with the second car of Neil Crompton and Brad Jones not finishing after running out of fuel. =1992= With Win Percy having decided to return to England, Tomas Mezera was hired. Due to a budget shortfall and the need to develop the VP Commodore for the new V8 formula, HRT only competed at the Sandown, Lakeside and Eastern Creek rounds. Two 1993 spec VP Commodores were raced at the Sandown 500 with Mezera and Brad Jones finishing third while Percy and Grice finished fifth at the Bathurst 1000. Mezera and Jones drove two cars at the Grand Prix support races. =1993= With budget problems compounded by Castrol deciding to transfer its funding to Perkins Engineering, at the beginning of 1993 there was some doubt as to whether the team would compete in the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship. Former 1987 World 500cc champion Wayne Gardner with only one touring car start was signed as the team's driver with Tomas Mezera's participation being dependent on additional sponsorship being secured, however he would ultimately compete in all nine rounds. At the Sandown 500 Mezera was joined by Michael Preston, with Brad Jones and Allan Grice in the second car. For the Bathurst 1000 Mezera was joined by Win Percy with Gardner and Jones driving the second car to a third- place finish. Gardner won a race at the Australian Grand Prix. The team's season was dominated by off-track politics. Before the end of the championship chief engineer Wally Storey and team manager Neal Lowe had left the team with Mezera appointed as acting team manager. Before the Sandown 500, Gardner was suspended for two weeks from the team. HRT alleged Gardner was trying to poach the team's sponsors for his own operation, Gardner claimed that he was acting on a request by the team to help secure extra funding. Gardner secured funding from Coca-Cola for 1994, but his proposal for taking part ownership was rejected by Tom Walkinshaw and he elected to form Wayne Gardner Racing. At Bathurst, Jeff Grech commenced what would ultimately be a very successful stint as team manager. =1994= In 1994 Peter Brock was signed to drive for the team. In spite of some resistance by some within Holden after the manufacturer's split with Brock's Holden Dealer Team in 1987, the substantial Mobil and NGK sponsorship he brought to the team made the deal irresistible. Both of these sponsors remain with the team as of 2020. The team was competitive throughout the ATCC, with Brock taking the round win at Eastern Creek and second places at Sandown, Symmons Plains, Philip Island and Oran Park on the way to a third-place finish, Mezera finished ninth. Brock's win at Eastern Creek was the HRT's first ever ATCC round win. For the endurance events, Brad Jones and Rickard Rydell (who was driving a Volvo 850 for TWR in the British Touring Car Championship) were earmarked to drive the second car. However, with Rydell's wife due to give birth, he was replaced by Craig Lowndes for the Sandown 500. After finishing fifth and setting the fastest lap of the four drivers, HRT elected to retain Lowndes for the Bathurst 1000. Despite Lowndes crashing in the warm up and spinning mid race, a stellar double stint from Jones saw the car finish second. The lead car crashed late in the race. =1995= For 1995 the VR Commodore was introduced. Brock remained a championship contender at the final round at Oran Park, finishing third with Mezera fifth. Lowndes and Greg Murphy ran the second car at the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 however neither finished either race. After the Grand Prix support race it was announced that Lowndes would drive for the team full-time in 1996, he would take Mezera's seat for the season ending Brock Challenge at Calder. =1996= The 1996 VR Commodore of Craig Lowndes. With the demise of tobacco sponsorship, HRT had been able to lure many key personnel from Gibson Motorsport. This helped the team dominate the 1996 season with Craig Lowndes winning the ATCC, Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000, the latter two in partnership with Greg Murphy. Brock finished the series in fourth being joined again by Tomas Mezera for the endurance races. With Lowndes headed to Europe in 1997 to compete in F3000, Murphy was hired as his replacement and debuted at two races in New Zealand at the end of the year. =1997= The year saw a number of mechanical failures with the VS Commodores that prevented HRT from following on from the success of 1996. One highlight of the year were one-two finishes at both Symmons Plains and Wanneroo. Just before the Eastern Creek round of the series, Brock announced his retirement from full-time racing. Overall, Murphy and Brock finished the year fourth and sixth respectively. Lowndes returned to drive in the endurance events with Murphy, while Mark Skaife co-drove with Brock. Lowndes and Murphy won the Sandown 500 while despite Skaife winning pole at both events, he and Brock failed to finish. At selected events a third car was entered under the Holden Young Lions banner with Jason Bargwanna, Todd Kelly, Mark Noske and Stephen White driving. Bargwanna and Noske drove a car in the endurance races. =1998= For 1998 Lowndes returned to HRT and Skaife succeeded Brock. With the Holden Young Lions program sub-contracted to Gibson Motorsport, HRT returned to a two-car team except for the Calder round where Greg Murphy debuted the VT Commodore. Lowndes won the ATCC with Skaife finishing third. Lowndes and Skaife finished second at the Sandown 500. At the Bathurst 1000 despite winning pole position and leading much of the race, Lowndes and Skaife suffered a number of tyre failures finishing sixth. The second car of Greg Murphy and Mark Noske suffered a crash in late qualifying causing them to miss the shootout and cause endless problems throughout the race including the same tyre woes that Lowndes and Skaife suffered and retired on lap 86. =1999= Lowndes again won the ATCC with Skaife third despite Lowndes having to miss the Symmons Plains round after a car destroying rollover at Calder. Endurance driver Cameron McConville deputised in Lowndes's 1996 winning VS Commodore. For the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000, Lowndes was joined by McConville finishing third and second respectively. Skaife was joined by Paul Morris finishing third at Bathurst. A third car was entered in the endurance races under the Holden Young Lions with Todd Kelly and Mark Noske driving. 2000s =2000= In 2000 Skaife won the championship with Lowndes finishing in third. At the Queensland 500 Lowndes and Skaife teamed together to win. The second car was driven by Todd Kelly and Nathan Pretty, however failed to finish. At the Bathurst 1000, Lowndes and Skaife finished in sixth position with Jason Plato and Yvan Muller. Kelly raced the Holden Young Lions entry at some rounds being joined by Pretty at Bathurst. Off-track Craig Lowndes wanted out of his ten-year management contract with Tom Walkinshaw and left the team at season's end for Gibson Motorsport. =2001= In 2001, TWR Australia expanded to become a four-car operation with the formation of the two-car K-Mart Racing Team. Because a team could only race three cars under a Racing Entitlement Contract (REC), Romano Racing's REC was leased for the two K-Mart cars with the Romano car entered as a third Holden Racing Team car under the Holden Young Lions banner. Jason Bright joined the team. At the Queensland 500 Skaife and Bright shared a car with Tony Longhurst and Tomas Mezera driving the second. For the Bathurst 1000 the lead drivers were split, Skaife and Longhurst winning. Skaife won the series, Bright finished third. =2002= In 2002 Skaife again won the championship with Bright finishing fourth. HRT won the first eight rounds of the season. Jim Richards and Mezera drove the second car at the Queensland 500. At the Bathurst 1000 Skaife and Richards won with Bright and Mezera third. A third car was raced throughout the season under the Holden Young Lions banner by Rick Kelly, finishing fourth at Bathurst with Nathan Pretty. =2003= Todd Kelly's VY Commodore at Barbagallo Raceway in 2003 In early 2003 Tom Walkinshaw Racing collapsed and the team was put up for sale by the administrator. Holden purchased the team, but because manufacturers were prohibited from owning teams, it was quickly sold to Mark Skaife. The K-Mart team was purchased by John and Margaret Kelly, continuing to be a customer of HRT until the end of 2008. Paul Weel Racing also became a HRT customer with Jason Bright moving to the team with Todd Kelly commencing a five-year stint as the driver of the second car. For the endurance races Jim Richards and Tony Longhurst rejoined the team. Skaife and Kelly won the Sandown 500 with Longhurst and Richards finishing in tenth. At the Bathurst 1000 Skaife and Kelly finished the race in eighth after being black flagged late in the race to repair accident damage with Richards and Longhurst fifth. =2004= In 2004 Kelly finished the championship in seventh place and Skaife in twelfth after one of his worst seasons on record where it included a number of driver errors and reliability issues. For the endurance events Jason Plato joined Peter Brock in the second car. Skaife and Kelly finished the Bathurst 1000 in fourteenth position, two laps down after a belt from the engine broke early in the race. =2005= In 2005 both Skaife and Kelly won rounds of the championship with Kelly winning the historic V8 Supercars China Round at Shanghai International Circuit. This victory gave HRT its 50th round win, the first team to do so. Skaife and Kelly won the Bathurst 1000. Jim Richards and James Courtney drove the second car, however failed to finish. =2006= In 2006 Kelly finished the season in sixth place and Skaife finished in a miserable sixteenth. Both drivers did have success during with Skaife winning at Pukekohe and Wanneroo and Kelly winning at Surfers Paradise and Phillip Island. With HRT out of the title race by the time of the endurance races and the sister HSV Dealer Team having both its drivers in contention, it was controversially decided to split its drivers with Garth Tander driving with Skaife and Kelly with his brother Rick at the HSV Dealer Team. However the plan was not successful with the Skaife/Tander car finishing 26th at the Sandown 500 and crashing on lap 1 at Bathurst after a driveline failure. The second HRT car was driven by Jim Richards and Ryan Briscoe and finished in 21st at Sandown and did not finish at Bathurst. =2007= The 2007 V8 Supercar season saw the debut of the new VE Commodore. Skaife finished sixth and Kelly seventh with post scoring race wins. Glenn Seton and Nathan Pretty were signed to drive the second car. However, with Skaife requiring appendix surgery the week before the Sandown 500, a reshuffle saw Kelly and Pretty paired in one car and Seton and Tony Longhurst in the second. =2008= The VE Commodore of Garth Tander and Mark Skaife at the 2008 L&H; 500 In 2008 defending champion Garth Tander engineer Matthew Nielson and sponsor Toll transferred from sister team HSV Dealer Team.All change for 2008 For the endurance races Glenn Seton was joined by Craig Baird. On 29 October Skaife also announced that 2008 would be his last season in a full-time drive in V8 Supercars. At the end of the year, Skaife sold his 50% share in the team to Tom Walkinshaw. =2009= With John and Margaret Kelly having elected to form their own team and use Perkins Engineering hardware, the team expanded to four cars in 2009, two entered under the HRT banner and two under the Walkinshaw Racing banner. One REC was purchased from WPS Racing and another was acquired from V8 Supercars Australia that had last been used by Romano Racing with Paul Dumbrell moving across with financial support from his family's Autobarn business while David Reynolds joined as the second driver with sponsorship from Bundaberg Red Rum. Dumbrell finished 15th in the championship at seasons end with several top-six finishes while Reynolds finished 22nd, showing pace and promise but no real results. At HRT, Will Davison took Skaife's seat. Tander and Davison won the Bathurst 1000 with Davison finishing second in the series. HRT did win the team's championship. 2010s =2010= Garth Tander's VE Commodore at the 2011 Clipsal 500 Adelaide.

In 2010 Tander finished fifth and Davison 22nd. As a whole, the team struggled to string together a series and ended a disappointing seventh in the team's championship. For the endurance races Tander was paired with Cameron McConville and Davison with David Reynolds. For the Bathurst 1000 the team ran a retro livery in recognition of the team's 1990 Bathurst victory.Retro livery set for Toll HRT at Bathurst Speedcafe 30 August 2010 =2011= With Will Davison departing for Ford Performance Racing, defending champion James Courtney joined the team. The season started with Courtney winning in Abu Dhabi. For the endurance races, Tander was joined by Nick Percat and Courtney by McConville. Tander and Percat won the Bathurst 1000. Tander finished the season fifth, Courtney tenth. On the Walkinshaw Racing side, the team downsized to a single car for Coulthard with continued support from Bundaberg Rum, the race number was changed to No. 61. =2012= In 2012 the team scored no wins with Tander finishing the season in seventh, Courtney tenth.

Geography Sule Skerry lies west of the Orkney Mainland at . Sule Skerry's sole neighbour, Sule Stack, lies to the southwest. The remote islands of Rona and Sula Sgeir lie approximately further to the west. Sule Skerry and Sule Stack are both a part of the Orkney Islands council area. Sule Skerry is in area and about long.SPA description It reaches a height of .National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency: Sailing Directions (Enroute), Pub. 141, Scotland. It is formed of Lewisian gneiss. Biology Sule Skerry together with Sule Stack are listed as a Special Protection Area as they are home during the breeding season to thousands of puffins and gannets and smaller numbers of the rarer Leach's storm petrel and storm petrels. Note that Leach's petrel visit the island but breeding is not proved. Since the first visiting birds in 2003 there is now a large breeding population of gannets; a possible overflow from nearby Sule Stack. Every three years the puffins and other seabirds on Sule Skerry are monitored by a team of birders called the Sule Skerry Ringing Group. They have been monitoring the seabirds on the island since 1975. The island is treeless, since few trees would withstand the high winds of winter and salt spray environment. The dominant plant is maritime mayweed (Tripleurospermum maritimum). Lighthouse Sule Skerry with lighthouse from the south (drawing) Landing Place, July 15, 1967 There is a lighthouse at the centre high point of the island and a number of small cairns around the periphery. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the Sule Skerry lighthouse was the most remote manned lighthouse in Great Britain from its opening in 1895 to its automation in 1982. Its remote location meant that construction could only take place during the summer, thus it took from 1892‚Äì94 to complete. A meteorological buoy used in Met Office's Marine Automatic Weather Station (MAWS) Network is located off Sule Skerry. Results from the buoy are used in the Shipping Forecast.

He made thirty-nine representative appearances for the Australian national team in Tests, World Cup and New South Wales State of Origin matches between 1985 and 1991. His football career was followed by a period as a commentator. Background Roach was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Club career Although born in Sydney, Roach played his early rugby league for Wests Illawarra and was signed by the Balmain Tigers in 1982. He quickly advanced to first grade and in 1983 was part of the Balmain side which made the semi-finals for the first time since 1977. Between then and 1992 Roach played 185 first grade games for the Tigers. 1987 was almost completely wiped out for Roach due to a serious knee injury and though he returned to excellent form in 1988 he was cited for a tackle on Penrith's Chris Mortimer suspended for four weeks, missing the 1988 finals including the Grand Final loss to Canterbury. In the 1989 club season his combination with Paul Sironen, Benny Elias and Wayne Pearce was one of the strongest packs in club rugby league history and the side dominated opposing forwards. In the 1989 Grand Final, after having led Canberra 12 points to 2 at half-time, the Tigers were run down. Roach and Sironen were replaced by coach Warren Ryan late in the 2nd half and when the game ultimately went into extra time they were unable to return and with their strikepower gone in the added period Canberra were able to overpower Balmain 19-14. In 1991 his club form showed some decline but he again managed national selection and his experience was vital to the improvement of a side needing reorganisation after they suffered a shocking start to the club season. After an ankle injury in 1991 he was also troubled by a knee injury in 1992 which would prove to be his last club season. Representative career State representative honours first came his way in 1984 when he was called into the New South Wales Blues side for all three games of that year's State of Origin series. Thereafter barring injury (which ruled him out of the 1987 series) and his surprise omission in 1989 (which saw NSW suffer their second straight 3-0 defeat by Queensland), he was generally a regular Blues starter and he made 17 State of Origin appearances until Game 2 of the 1991 series. When Jack Gibson was New South Wales coach in 1989 and 1990, he reportedly threatened the NSWRL with resignation from the position if Roach was selected in the side, though the Balmain front rower was selected in 1990 and went on to win their first series since their 3-0 win in 1986. In 1985, Roach became the 562nd player to represent Australia when he made his national representative d√©but in the first Test in Brisbane against New Zealand. His excellent club form for Balmain in 1986 ensured his place on the 1986 Kangaroo tour where he appeared in two Tests and seven minor tour matches, though his tour was interrupted after he suffered a dislocated elbow in a match against St. Helens before the second Ashes test against Great Britain. Citations and despatches to the sin-bin in the 1989 club season may have contributed to his omission by State selectors from the Blues squad of that year however powerful club performances with his fellow representative Balmain forwards made him a certainty for the 1989 New Zealand tour where he played in all three Tests. On the 1990 Kangaroo tour Roach played in all five Tests against Great Britain and France and in five other minor tour games. In a Test match against New Zealand in Melbourne in 1991, Roach clashed famously with Kiwi forward Dean Lonergan and required 20 stitches. Early in the game the Kiwi forward had attempted a tackle on Roach but the pair accidentally clashed heads, leaving Roach requiring stitches and Lonergan convulsing on the ground, though both would return to the game. Blocker was dropped after the Australian's shock 24-8 loss to NZ in the Melbourne test but was chosen for the end of season tour of Papua New Guinea.. However, Roach suffered a broken ankle in the first match of the tour which would prove to be his last appearance in any game for the Kangaroos Playing style In a game in 1990 against Manly at Brookvale Oval, he received a four-week suspension for backchatting the referee Eddie Ward, whom Roach patronisingly patted on the head after he was ordered from the field. Coming into physical contact with a referee is regarded as a serious offence and Roach was considered fortunate that no further action was taken, especially considering Roach had also verbally abused the touch judge on his way off the field, calling him a ‚Äú(expletive) wombat‚Äù. Post-playing life By the end of the 1992 season Roach had written an autobiography, Doing My Block and he became a commentator with the Nine Network as well as making appearances on The NRL Footy Show. After a disagreement with fellow Channel 9 commentators Paul Vautin and Peter Sterling he was sacked by the network and signed by the official rugby league radio broadcaster 2UE, before later moving to 2GB with Ray Hadley and his Continuous Call Team. He has made further television appearances on the Seven Network's Sportsworld and is one of a number of former players who appear in radio, TV and print ads for the Lowes menswear chain. After a 3-year stint as assistant coach with Manly, Roach was appointed to the coaching committee of his beloved Tigers - now the Wests Tigers. On 23 June 2000, Roach was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. In February 2008, Steve Roach was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In 2011 Roach joined Network Ten's new Thursday night Rugby League show The Game Plan. In 2014, Roach was sacked by 2GB after a staff member filed a bullying complaint against him. In 2016 he made a comeback to the Rugby League commentary box signing on with Fox Sports. In 2018, Roach revealed that his nickname ‚ÄòBlocker‚Äô actually came from his time employed as a Licensed Plumber where it was remarked by his colleagues that he would ‚Äòblock‚Äô pipes that would subsequently require plumbing works to be conducted. In 2019, he appeared regularly on Fox Sports panel show, 'Controversy Corner', as well as commentating for the network.

In terms of population it is the largest village in Rutland, and the third-largest settlement after Oakham and Uppingham. This is due in part to the presence of Kendrew Barracks (formerly RAF Cottesmore). At the time of Edward the Confessor (mid 11th century), \\"Manors Cottesmore\\" was held, together with Greetham, by Saxon called Goda. Goda held 12 carucates of land, three of which were held in tax to the Danegeld. The King held three carucates in demesne and three socmen with 40 villeins and six bordarii held 20 carucates. Of the land held by the manor, one Goisfridus held half a carucate; he had one plough and eight villeins. Cottesmore also had of meadow and a wood measuring a mile in length by seven furlongs in breadth. St Nicholas' Church, Cottesmore is a Grade II* listed building. The north aisle forms a RAF chapel, dedicated in 1949 to those who gave their lives while serving at RAF Cottesmore. A stained glass window was erected to the memory of Major General George Williams Knox CB (1838 - 1894). The colours of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards were gifted to the church by his widow and hang in the nave. The Cottesmore Benefice is part of the North Rutland Churches group. There are two primary schools in the parish: St Nicholas C of E (Aided) Primary School is in the village and Cottesmore Academy is on the military base. The Cottesmore Hunt takes its name from the village (although the kennels are not now in the parish). Sir William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale brought the foxhounds he had bought from Thomas Noel to Cottesmore in 1740. Three ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Cottesmore after the Cottesmore hunt.

Well Cross, Edith Weston Edith Weston Hall Edith Weston Hall was a former country house built in an Elizabethan style by the architect Lewis Vulliamy for the Rev. Richard Lucas in 1830, replacing the Old Hall which stood near the church. He died in 1846 and was succeeded by his son Richard Lucas, High Sheriff of Rutland for 1847, who passed it on to his brother George Vere Lucas, who took the surname of Braithwaite under the terms of a will. His son Major Ernest Lucas Braithwaite (also High Sheriff in 1902) sold the estate in 1904 to his nephew, Stafford Vere Hotchkin.

In Australia, the group was called \\"British Jigsaw\\" due to the existence of a local band of the same name. Overview Formed as a six-piece band of musicians in Coventry and Rugby by Tony Campbell in April 1966, they scored a number of hit singles around the world, and released thirteen albums. The group was partly influenced by fellow British musicians the Beatles, at times sounding Beatlesesque, especially their ballads, which show leanings towards Paul McCartney's musical and vocal arrangements. The early days The original line-up consisted of Dave \\"Biffo\\" Beech (vocals and drums) (born David Beech, 25 September 1945, in Rugby, Warwickshire, died 7 June 2007); Clive Scott (keyboards and vocals) (born Clive Kenneth Scott, 24 February 1945, in Coventry, died 10 May 2009); Barrie Bernard (bass guitar) (born 27 November 1944, in Coventry); Tony Campbell (guitar) (born Anthony Campbell, 24 June 1944, in Rugby); Tony Britnell (saxophone) and Kevin \\"Beppy\\" Mahon (tenor saxophone). Biffo left in the first year, and was replaced by Des Dyer (drums) (born Desmond Roy Dyer, 22 May 1948, in Rugby), who took over lead vocals. Scott had been in Scott and The Antarctics; Dyer had played in The Surfcyders and Clockwork Shoppe; Campbell, Mahon and Beech had worked together in The Mighty Avengers; and Bernard had been a member of Pinkerton's Assorted Colours, whilst Britnell had worked with The Fortunes. Campbell named the band after a Manchester nightclub called \\"The Jigsaw Club\\", but the way that he 'pieced together' the band from other members of existing groups also gave added aptness to the name. In 1970, the group were given the opportunity of turning fully professional by being the backing band for Arthur Conley, on his European tour. Most of the band did so, but Kevin Mahon decided to keep his day job and left the band. In 1974, Tony Britnell became seriously ill and left the band. After his recuperation he became a member of The Sunsets, the backing band for Shakin' Stevens. Change in musical direction and commercial success On stage, Jigsaw were a wild rock band who had a high energy live show; drum kits were set on fire, explosions were set off as an effect, Tony Britnell performed fire eating and Clive Scott would make his Marshall stack explode and disintegrate. However, during the early 1970s they began writing and recording more mainstream pop. Jigsaw's arrangement of the Johann Sebastian Bach tune, Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring was featured on their 1970 debut album Letherslade Farm. The group give credit to their producer and manager, Chas Peate, for inspiration to get songs completed. As Jigsaw toured a lot, Scott and Dyer would write snippets of songs separately in their spare time, but, as Dyer said in an interview in the 1990s, \\"it was Chas who would say we're recording an album soon, you'll need 10 songs by then\\". The two would then combine their work together for the planned recording sessions. As songwriters, the duo had a hit song with \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", which was covered by the UK band Candlewick Green in 1974. The song was further covered in the U.S. by Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods (this version made the U.S. charts), and again in 1993 by Saint Etienne. The song was also on Jigsaw's 1974 album I‚Äôve Seen The Film, I‚Äôve Read The Book. However, the band's own single from the album \\"You‚Äôre Not The Only Girl\\" was not a chart success. Early in 1975, the single \\"Baby Don't Do It\\" received heavy airplay on the UK service of Radio Luxembourg, but the record was not a hit and the band were soon dropped by their recording label, BASF. Jigsaw on the Dutch TV programme TopPop on 20 January 1975. Wanting to carry on, the group continued to make music and signed a new deal with independent UK label Splash, which was founded by Chas Peate himself. Their first single for their new label, titled \\"Sky High\\", was recorded for the film The Man from Hong Kong, a 1975 martial- arts action movie starring George Lazenby. Splash pressed a couple of hundred promotional copies and reaction to the song was good, especially from Radio Luxembourg which began playing the song with high rotation during its nightly English pop music broadcasts to the UK. \\"Sky High\\" subsequently made the UK Top 10 in November 1975. The recording was licensed to Chelsea Records in the United States where it reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and to No. 2 Adult Contemporary. The song was also No. 1 in Japan. A famous Mexican wrestler, Mil M√°scaras, used \\"Sky High\\" as his theme tune. He would walk to the ring with the song playing in the background, and his popularity in Japan helped \\"Sky High\\" to become a hit twice over in that country in consecutive years. The Sky High album also sold well too, especially in Japan. The next single \\"Love Fire\\" was another hit, although not in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, \\"Love Fire\\" was followed by two new albums, one for the British market called Pieces of Magic and another for the American market simply named, Jigsaw. In 1977, the band recorded an album Journey into Space in Los Angeles. Years later, Clive Scott revealed in an interview that the record label 20th Century Records paid for the band to fly out to make the album, paid for their accommodation, and gave them cash advances (or, as Scott called it, \\"pocket money\\") to live off for three months while making the record. The album was produced by Rick Jarrard who was the producer of Jose Feliciano and the person responsible for putting together Elvis Presley's Las Vegas band. However, the album was never released outside of Japan, much to the frustration of the group. Jigsaw returned to Britain and scored another hit with the single \\"If I Have To Go Away\\", after which they recorded ten original songs for the film Home Before Midnight, which were later released on a soundtrack album of the same name. Break-up Bernard left the band in 1978 and was replaced by Jon Fox. Campbell also left the band in 1979 and was replaced by Rod Godwin. The band ceased touring in 1981 but Scott and Dyer continued to record using Tim Stone on guitar and Pete Dennis on bass. This new group lineup recorded one album for Elektra. The album, a disco influenced set (that was never released in the United Kingdom) was issued in the United States the following year. A final single under the Jigsaw name was released by Splash in early 1983 called \\"Love Isn't at Home\\". Following the group split, Scott and Dyer continued to be successful songwriters, having their work recorded by Nicki French, Bad Boys Inc, Boyzone, Jon Otis, Bobby Rydell, and many others. After leaving his music career behind when he quit Jigsaw in 1979, Tony Campbell went back to his first occupation, ophthalmic engineering. He had a family. One of his daughters created and manages the Royal Academy of Dance dance school in Rugby, Warwickshire. Barrie Bernard continued to work in the entertainment business, running night clubs and being an active magician. Though no new studio albums have been issued, eight newly recorded songs were included on a 1995 compilation CD, entitled The Best of Jigsaw, just one of the collections of their music released. Dyer has twice attempted to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest, taking part in the 1983 and 1985 A Song For Europe competitions. In 1983, he placed third as lead singer of the group Casablanca with the song \\"With Love\\". Two years later, as a soloist, he took \\"Energy\\" to fourth place. The song from 1985, \\"Energy\\", was reworked to become the album track \\"Voice of America\\" and sung by Nicki French for her first studio album \\"Secrets\\". In 1988, Dyer provided backing vocals at the Eurovision final alongside Julie Forsyth and Dominic Grant, both formerly of Guys 'n' Dolls, for the UK entry performed by Scott Fitzgerald, \\"Go\\". This song placed second in the contest held in Dublin on 30 April. The UK lost by one point to Celine Dion, representing Switzerland with \\"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi\\" (Don't Leave Without Me). Much has also been made about their lack of success in the UK charts, where only two of their singles made the Top 40. It has been suggested this was because BBC Radio 1, the most popular station in the UK at the time, gave little or no airplay to their singles after \\"Sky High\\" in 1975. However, the group lasted a long time and were big stars in Japan, as well as having four Billboard Hot 100 hit singles in the U.S. Their music is also still in print on compact disc, enjoying healthy sales. The sleeve notes to their 1998 Greatest Hits collection, The Very Best of Jigsaw stated \\"A look at Jigsaw's songs reveals the innovative work of its creators: the advanced song structure, the clever use of classical techniques like counterpoint and a novel approach to using sound effects ‚Äì leaving the listener with a sadly-overlooked-but-very-impressive catalogue of melodic pop songs\\".

Other monuments in the church include: The Harington monument *Robert Keilway (1497 ‚Äì 1581), politician and court official. *Sir James Harington (c. 1511 ‚Äì 1592), public servant who fulfilled a number of legal, legislative and law enforcement duties and was knighted in 1565. *Baptist Noel, 4th Earl of Gainsborough (1708 ‚Äì 21 March 1751), Member of Parliament, styled Viscount Campden until 1714. *Frances Noel, Countess of Gainsborough VA (20 November 1814 ‚Äì 12 May 1885), Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. *George Douglas-Pennant, 2nd Baron Penrhyn (30 September 1836 ‚Äì 10 March 1907), landowner who played a prominent part in the Welsh slate industry as the owner of the Penrhyn Quarry in North Wales. *Lieutenant Tom Cecil Noel MC (12 December 1897 ‚Äì 22 August 1918), World War I infantry officer turned aerial observer, notable for winning a Military Cross for bravery on both land and air. The church spire was struck by lightning in 1843, causing a fire that melted the roof, shattered the windows, and destroyed the west end of the church. It was subsequently rebuilt by J. L. Pearson in 1852/3.

He is best known for his work on The Avengers and Captain America for Marvel Comics. Early life Epting's influences include Alex Raymond, Stan Drake, Jim Holdaway, Joe Kubert, John Buscema, Al Williamson, and Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. Epting received a BFA in graphic design from the University of South Carolina. Career In 1989, Epting read of a contest being conducted by independent comic book publisher First Comics, with the winner's story to be published by the company. Although the contest did not actually exist, First declared Epting one of the \\"winners\\" and he began drawing for the company. His assignments for First included backup stories for Nexus, guest-artist duties on Dreadstar and Whisper, and two miniseries starring Nexus supporting character Judah Maccabee: Hammer of God and Hammer of God: Sword of Justice. Epting's cover for The Avengers #345 (March 1992) By early 1991, First Comics had gone out of business, and Epting was sending submissions to other comics publishers. He found work at Marvel Comics. Originally assigned to draw half the issues in a six‚Äìpart biweekly The Avengers story arc, Epting drew five of the six issues (#335‚Äì339). Shortly thereafter, he became the full-time penciler on the series with issue #341 (Nov. 1991). Working closely with writer Bob Harras and inker/colorist Tom Palmer, Epting crafted several Avengers adventures. The creative team introduced a new version of the Swordsman character in issue #343 and worked on the \\"Operation: Galactic Storm\\" crossover storyline. His stint on The Avengers ended with issue #375 (June 1994). After leaving The Avengers in 1994, Epting spent the next few years working on Marvel's franchise of X-Men titles including the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" crossoverManning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 272: \\"The story began in [the] X-Men Alpha special by writers Scott Lobdell and Mark Waid and pencillers Roger Cruz and Steve Epting.\\" and Factor-X, the alternate timeline counterparts of X-Factor.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 273: \\"One-eyed prelate Scott Summers rebelled against his master Apocalypse...in this four- issue miniseries by writer John Francis Moore and artists Steve Epting and Terry Dodson. He had a run on the X-Factor ongoing series, but mostly concentrated on annuals, specials, and mini-series. These included X-Men '97, Bishop: X.S.E., and the Marvel Comics/Image Comics cross-over Team X/Team 7. In 1998, Epting collaborated with writer Roger Stern on a story starring Marvel's World War II heroes, The Invaders. It was serialized in the first three issues of the Marvel Universe anthology title and was inked by Al Williamson. In 1999, Epting moved to DC Comics. He was the main artist on the Superman series as well as on Aquaman, where he was teamed up with writer Dan Jurgens. Their work on Aquaman began with issue #63 and ran until issue #75. In 2001, Epting returned to Marvel's Avengers for two issues (#36 and #37), which had been relaunched three years earlier with writer Kurt Busiek. Most of his work during the early 2000s was for the independent comics publisher, CrossGen. Epting drew issues #1‚Äì25 of Crux, a fantasy-adventure book co- created with writer Mark Waid. Epting's next CrossGen project, El Cazador, was an historical adventure centering on a female pirate, it was cancelled after only six issues. In 2004, Epting returned to Marvel as one of the artists on the Ultimate Nightmare limited series.Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 323: \\"Ultimate Nightmare was a five-issue limited series by writer Warren Ellis and artists Trevor Hairsine and Steve Epting, which teamed the Ultimates with the X-Men.\\" In January 2005, Epting teamed with writer Ed Brubaker to relaunch Captain America.Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 325: \\"When acclaimed writer Ed Brubaker made the switch from DC to Marvel, he brought with him yet another relaunch for Steve Rogers.

He is the second martyr in Islam, with the first being his wife, Sumayyah. Early life Yasir was originally from the Malik clan of the Madhhij tribe in Yemen. He and his two brothers, Al-Harith and Malik, travelled northwards to Mecca to search for a fourth brother who was lost. Al-Harith and Malik returned to Yemen, but Yasir decided to settle in Mecca. He entered the protection of Abu Hudhayfa ibn al- Mughira, a member of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013).

Yasir also had two other sons, Hurth and Abdullah, but there is no indication that Sumayyah was their mother. Hurth, who was the eldest of the three, was killed by the Dil clan before 610. Conversion to Islam Yasir, Sumayyah, Abdullah and Ammar all became Muslims at an early date \\"on the rise of Islam\\". From c.614 the Quraysh persecuted Muslims of low social rank.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. After the death of Abu Hudhayfa left Yasir and his family without a protector in Mecca, the Makhzum clan tortured them to pressure them to abandon their faith. Yasir, Sumayyah and Ammar were forced to stand in the sun in the heat of the day dressed in mail-coats. Muhammad passed while they were standing like that and urged them, \\"Patience, O family of Yasir! Your meeting- place will be Paradise.\\" Abu Jahl, a member of the Makhzum clan, killed Sumayyah by stabbing and impaling her with his spear. Death and legacy It is generally assumed that Yasir was also killed in the persecution. However, there is no mention of Yasir's death in any of the early sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa'd, Bukhari, Muslim or Tabari. Since he is not named among those who emigrated to Medina in 622, he probably died before that date; but it is possible that his death was natural.

They were private institutions, and combined the functions of a Confucian shrine and a preparatory school. In educational terms, the seowon were primarily occupied with preparing students for the national civil service examinations. In most cases, seowon served only pupils of the aristocratic yangban class. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO recognized a collection of nine seowon as a World Heritage Site. History Gosan seowon Seowons first appeared in Korea in the early Joseon Dynasty. They were modeled after early private Chinese academies of classical learning shuyuan. The latter originated in the 8th century under the Tang dynasty and were later dismantled under the Yuan dynasty to become preparatory schools for the imperial examinations under government control. Although the exact year of seowons introduction in Korea is not known for certain, in 1418 King Sejong issued rewards to two scholars for their work in setting up seowon in Gimje and Gwangju.Park et al. (2002), p. 70. The first seowon to receive a royal charter was the Sosu Seowon in Punggi, presided over by Toegye, which was given a hanging board by King Myeongjong in 1550.Park et al. (2002), p. 70; (1984), p. 207. Many seowon were established by leading literati, or by local groups of yangban families. For instance, Ju Se-bong established the Sosu Seowon, which continued in operation long after his death. Some of them were built by Sarim scholars who retired to villages in the wake of literati purges of 16th century and served as their political bases. Most seowon were closed by an edict of the regent Daewon-gun in the turbulent final years of the 19th century. He banned the unauthorized construction of seowon in 1864, and removed their tax exemption in 1868; finally, in 1871, he ordered all but a handful closed. (1984), p. 262. The provincial yangban were outraged by these measures, and this is among the reasons that Daewon-gun was driven from power in 1873; however, the seowon remained closed.

The population of the civil parish remained unchanged between the 2001 and the 2011 census'. Glaston is about south of Rutland Water and is situated on the A47, east of Uppingham. There are approximately 80 houses in total with one public house, The Old Pheasant on Main Road (A47) (previously the Monckton Arms), and a flooring warehouse, Glaston Carpets. There is an active Parish Meeting that is held once a month and villagers are trying to get a bypass for the village. The parish church of St Andrew is a Grade II* listed building and has an unusual central spire. A rectangular pond is a cartwash of circa 1740, used for soaking cartwheels to prevent the wood shrinking from iron tyres and also for horses' hooves to prevent hardening.

So where English is a first language the unqualified use of the word football is used to refer to the most popular code of football in that region. The sports most frequently referred to as simply football are Association football, American football, Australian rules football, Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby league football and rugby union football. Of the 45 national FIFA (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, 43 use football in their organisations' official names (Canada and the United States use soccer). Soccer is the prevailing term for association football in the United States and Canada, where other codes of football are dominant. In 2005, Australia's association football governing body changed its name from soccer to football to align with the general international usage of the term.Soccer to become football in Australia (SMH.com.au. 17 December 2004) \\"ASA chairman Frank Lowy said the symbolic move would bring Australia into line with the vast majority of other countries which call the sport football\\". In 2006, New Zealand decided to follow suit.NZ Football - The Local Name Of The Global Game (NZFootball.co.nz. 27 April 2006) \\"The international game is called football and were part of the international game so the game in New Zealand should be called football\\". There are also many other languages where the common term for association football is phonetically similar to the English term football. (See Names for association football.) Some of the many different codes of football. Etymology An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England: \\"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David\\".Francis Peabody Magoun, 1929, \\"Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature\\" (The American Historical Review, v. 35, No. 1). Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a \\"football game\\" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.Irish inventions: fact and fiction Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: \\"during the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself\\". A French card circa 1750, depicting \\"Foot Ball\\" Although the accepted etymology of the word football, or \\"foot ball\\", originated in reference to the action of a foot kicking a ball, this may be a false etymology. An alternative explanation has it that the word originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. (a.) ICONS Online (commissioned by the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport; no date) \\"History of Football\\" ; (b.) Bill Murray (sports historian), quoted by The Sports Factor, 2002, \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\" (Radio National, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 31 May 2002) and Michael Scott Moore, \\"Naming the Beautiful Game: It's Called Soccer\\" (Der Spiegel, 7 June 2006); (c.)

These sports were usually played by peasants, as opposed to the horse-riding sports more often enjoyed by aristocrats. In some cases, the word has been applied to games which involved carrying a ball and specifically banned kicking. For example, the English writer William Hone, writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir Frederick Morton Eden, regarding a game which Hone refers to as \\"Foot- Ball\\" played in the parish of Scone, Perthshire: > The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] > with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could > shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run > on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by > the other party, but no person was allowed to kick it. William Hone, > 1825-26, The Every-Day Book, \\"February 15.\\" Access date: March 15, 2007. > [Emphasis added.] Conversely, in 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning \\"...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\\",Derek Baker (England in the Later Middle Ages). 1995. Boydell & Brewer. p. 187. suggesting that \\"football\\" was in fact being differentiated from games that involved other parts of the body. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) traces the written use of the word \\"football\\" (as \\"foteballe\\"), referring to the game, to 1409. The first recorded use of the word to refer to the ball was in 1486, and the first use as a verb in 1599. The word \\"soccer\\" originated as an Oxford \\"-er\\" slang abbreviation of \\"association\\", and is credited to late nineteenth century English footballer, Charles Wreford-Brown. Ekblom mentions that while he was up at Oxford, Charles Wreford-Brown was asked at breakfast if he was playing rugger \\"No\\" he replied \\"I'm playing soccer\\" (Granville, 1969, p. 29). But Ekblom opinions that like the William Webb Ellis rugby story it is most likely apocryphal. However, like the William Webb Ellis rugby story, it is believed to be most likely apocryphal. There is also the sometimes-heard variation, \\"soccer football\\". National usage =Australia= Within Australia the term \\"football\\" is ambiguous and can mean up to four different codes of football in Australian English, depending on the context, geographical location and cultural factors; this includes soccer, Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union. In the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania the slang term footy is also used in an unofficial context, while in these states the two rugby football codes are called rugby. There is a different situation in New South Wales, Queensland and ACT, where rugby union or rugby league are most popular, and football can refer to those codes. Australia-wide, soccer is commonly used to describe association football, with this usage going back more than a century, with football gaining traction since Soccer Australia was renamed Football Federation Australia in 2005. =Canada= In Canada, football refers to Canadian football or American football, often differentiated as either \\"CFL\\" (from the governing Canadian Football League) or \\"NFL\\" (from the US National Football League). Because of the similarity between the games, many people in both countries do not consider the two styles of gridiron football separate sports per se, but rather different codes of the same sport which has a shared origin in the Harvard vs McGill game played in 1874 credited with the creation of this sport. If a Canadian were to say, \\"My brother plays football in the States\\", it would be clear from context that American football is meant. The Canadian Soccer Association / L'Association canadienne de soccer Canadian French usage parallels English usage, with le football usually referring to Canadian or American football, and le soccer referring to association football. When there is ambiguity, le football canadien or le football am√©ricain is used.LCF.ca :: Site Officiel de la Ligue Canadienne de Football F√©d√©ration de soccer du Qu√©bec (Soccer gains ground!) Sometimes le football and le soccer are interchangeable: \\"Sport le plus regard√© ..., le football ou soccer ...\\" (Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada) Rugby union football in Canada is almost always referred to simply as \\"rugby\\". =Caribbean= In most of the English-speaking Caribbean, \\"football\\" and \\"soccer\\" are both used to refer to association football, but use of the word \\"football\\" is far more common. The exception is the Bahamas, where the term \\"football\\" is used exclusively (while not actually in the Caribbean, usage in Bermuda follows that of the Bahamas). The nickname of the Trinidad and Tobago team, \\"The Soca Warriors\\", refers to a style of music, not the word soccer. =Ireland= In Ireland, \\"football\\" can mean Association football, Gaelic football, or Rugby union. =New Zealand= haka performed before a match by the All Blacks New Zealand Football is the governing body for Association football in the country.About NZ Football , New Zealand Football, 2015. Accessed 22 November 2015. The term can also be used to refer to rugby league or union, better-known as simply rugby. The slang term footy generally only means either of the two codes of rugby football, while rugby league is traditionally known as rugby league or just league. Usage of the term soccer has gone through a period of transition in recent times as the federation changed its name to New Zealand Football from New Zealand Soccer and the nickname of its women's team to Football Ferns from SWANZ. =South Africa= In South Africa, the word football generally refers to Association football. However, Association football is commonly known as soccer despite this.Football in South Africa The domestic first division is the Premier Soccer League and both in conversation and the media (see e.g. The Sowetan or Independent Online), the term \\"soccer\\" is used. The stadium used for the final of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was known as Soccer City. Despite this, the country's national association is called the South African Football Association and \\"football\\" is mostly used in official contexts. Rugby union is another popular football code in South Africa, but it is commonly known as just rugby as rugby league has a smaller presence in the country. =United Kingdom= An example of the word \\"soccer\\" used in London in August 2006. The general use of \\"football\\" in the United Kingdom tends to refer to the most popular code of football in the country, which in the cases of England and Scotland is Association football. However the term \\"soccer\\" is understood by most as an alternative name for association football. \\"Although not so widely used as the term 'football,' in England the term 'soccer' is widely understood. It is not so widely understood in continental Europe or Central and Southern America\\"Oxford English Dictionary:Soccer \\"The game of football as played under Association rules.\\" and Rugger \\"Slang or colloquial alteration of RUGBY (in the sense of 'Rugby football'). Freq. attrib. rugger-tackle\\" The word \\"soccer\\" was a recognised way of referring to Association football in the UK until around the 1970s, when it began to be perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. For fans who are more interested in other codes of football, within their sporting community, the use of the word 'football' may refer to their own code. However even within such sporting communities an unqualified mention of 'football' would usually be a reference to association football. Tony Collins.

As in Canada, football is used inclusively of Canadian football with American and Canadian football generally seen as two variants of the same sport. The term \\"gridiron football\\" is sometimes used to refer to both games together. The sport of association football is commonly called \\"soccer\\" in the United States. The word derives from \\"association\\" ‚Äì as in the Football Association ‚Äì in contrast to \\"rugger\\", or rugby football. It is English in origin, and caught on in the United States to distinguish the game from the locally better known American football; it also became predominant in other countries where another sport is known as football, such as Australia with Australian rules football. The term was in use in Britain throughout the early 20th century and became especially prominent in the decades after World War II, but by the 1980s British fans had begun avoiding the term, largely because it was seen as an Americanism.Friedman, Uri (13 June 2014). \\"Why Americans Call Soccer 'Soccer'\\".

Rugby league and Gaelic football have very small, albeit growing, numbers of adherents. \\"Football\\" as a loanword Many languages use phonetic approximations of the English word \\"football\\" for association football. Examples include: * Albanian: futboll * Bengali: ‡¶´‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶¨‡¶≤ (Futbol) * Filipino: futbol * Hungarian : futball * Lithuanian: futbolas * Persian: ŸÅŸàÿ™ÿ®ÿßŸÑ fuwtbal * Russian: —Ñ—É—Ç–±–æ–ª (futbol) * Spanish: f√∫tbol or futbol Both spellings are used. See also futbol. * Thai: ‡∏ü‡∏∏‡∏ï‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏• (f√∫t-bon) * Turkish: futbol This commonality is reflected in the auxiliary languages Esperanto and Interlingua, which utilize futbalo and football, respectively. These loanwords bear little or no resemblance to the native words for \\"foot\\" and \\"ball\\". By contrast, some languages have calques of \\"football\\": their speakers use equivalent terms that combine their words for \\"foot\\" and \\"ball\\". An example is the Greek œÄŒøŒ¥œåœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒø (pod√≥sfero) and the Chinese Ë∂≥ÁêÉ (z√∫ q√≠u). In German, \\"Football\\" is a loanword for American football, while the German word Fu√üball, a calque of \\"football\\" (Fu√ü = \\"foot\\", Ball = \\"ball\\"), means association football. The same goes for Dutch voetbal (voet = \\"foot\\", bal = \\"ball\\"), Swedish fotboll (fot = \\"foot\\", boll = \\"ball\\"), and so on ‚Äî the words for \\"foot\\" and \\"ball\\" are very similar in all the Germanic languages. Only two Germanic languages do not use \\"football\\" or a calque thereof as their primary word for association football: * Afrikaans ‚Äî sokker. This echoes the predominant use of \\"soccer\\" in South African English. * Icelandic ‚Äî knattspyrna (knatt- = ball- and spyrna = kicking) is one of the two most common terms; this reflects a tendency to create indigenous words for foreign concepts. However, the calque f√≥tbolti is at least equally common. The Celtic languages also generally refer to association football with calques of \\"football\\" ‚Äî an example is the Welsh p√™l-droed. However, Irish, which like Afrikaans is native to a country where \\"soccer\\" is the most common English term for the sport, uses sacar.

At Viswa Singha's coronation in 1523, Sisya Singha held the royal umbrella atop the crown, a sign of vassalage. Sisya Singha was given the title \\"Raikat\\" or \\"family guardian\\", and his descendants were hereditary prime ministers of the Koch Bihar successor state to the Kamata kingdom.

Since the construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, the village has been closed off on three sides by water and the area is known as the Hambleton Peninsula. The parish originally included the settlements of Upper Hambleton, Middle Hambleton and Nether Hambleton. The latter two have now been almost completely submerged by the construction of Rutland Water (originally known as Empingham Reservoir). The Jacobean Old Hall in Middle Hambleton (built in 1611) is now situated on the water's edge. The village contains the 12th century Church of England church of St Andrew, a pub called The Finch's Arms and a hotel and restaurant, Hambleton Hall. The church, much enlarged over its history still has an original Norman south doorway and was extensively restored and fitted out during the 19th century. This included excellent stained glass windows created mainly by J Egan during the last decade of the 19th century. Two of these were dedicated by the Reverend David Elliot Young to his mother and infant child who are buried in the attached graveyard. It is believed that the windows were funded by Walter Marshall after being petitioned by Rev Young. Adjacent to the south side of the church yard stands a sixteenth-century priest house. The Hall was built in 1881 as a hunting box by Walter Marshall who left it to his sister, Eva Astley Paston Cooper. She was a socialite who gathered a salon including No√´l Coward, Malcolm Sargent and Charles Scott- Moncrieff. Coward wrote Hay Fever while staying in the village. There is a view across to Burley House from the north side of the village and from the south one can see across to the sailing club at Edith Weston on the far shore. The track around the peninsula along the lakeside takes walkers and cyclists through bluebell woods. Abel Barker of Hambledon Sir Abel Barker of Hambleton (d. 1679) rented part of his lands from Edward Harington and James Harington, and farmed sheep on a large scale. Barker kept a letter-book, a copy of his and his family's letters. His sister Mary Barker wrote to the tailor John Swinfield in London to have a black gown made with a grass green or willow green petticoat and stomacher, and a warm winter woolen serge gown, and a scarlet serge riding coat and hood. She wanted Swinfeld's wife to buy some items for her including \\"cuffs of the neatest fashion.\\" Barker's mother Elizabeth Burton tried to arrange a marriage for Abel with Anne Burton, daughter of Sir Thomas Burton, an old friend, who replied that the matter rested with his daughter. They married, and in 1647 she wrote to a London merchant Augustine Crofts for blue watchett sarsenet to make bed curtains and for powdered bezoar stone. Anne Burton also asked her sister Jane to shop for her and buy presents for her family including the \\"best fashioned gloves you can get.\\" Abel Barker wrote to Elizabeth Goodman at Blaston, advising against marrying her deceased husband's half-brother which he believed to be uncanonical. After Anne died, in 1655 Barker tried to remarry with Mary Noell and with Rebekah Parsnett, who refused his offer. Mary Noell accepted, and in 1661 she wrote from Hambledon to her husband at the Dog and Ball on Fleet Street about the prevalent sickness of whooping cough and the risk to their children. Shortly before his death, Barker moved to a new house at Lyndon.HMC 5th Report: Field (London, 1876), pp. 387-98.

History Although it was only long it was, in its prime, an important industrial branch and it had its own short arm leading to private wharfs. It was lock free and throughout its working life it was extensively used. It had coal, sand and salt wharfs, a scrap iron wharf and various works along its banks.Ashton Canal: Islington Branch Retrieved on 2008-06-29 An interesting works was Molineux, Webb, & Company‚Äôs Glass Works situated at the head of the branch where flint glass products were made. In 1801, Samuel Oldknow, then the Chairman of the Peak Forest Canal Company, offered an Edward Stelfox ¬£50 towards the cost of building two lime kilns on the banks of the Ashton Canal on the condition that he burned limestone brought along the Peak Forest Canal. The site of these kilns is unknown but it is suspected that they were somewhere on this branch near Limekiln Lane. From the junction with the Ashton Canal, the branch ran to the north-west, until it passed under Mill Street. There was a sharp turn immediately beyond the bridge, and it continued in a north-easterly direction. It remained in use until the 1950s but by this time it was slowly becoming derelict. However, part of it remained open and British Waterways now has a yard there. Industry In 1851, there were coal wharves equipped with weighing machines on both sides of the section from the Ashton Canal to Mill Street bridge, with an undeveloped area on the east bank nearest to the junction.Ordnance Survey, 1:1056 map, 1851 This clear area had become the Albion Spindle Works by 1891,Ordnance Survey, 1:500 map, 1891 but had been subdivided and was occupied by a toy balloon works and a chain works in 1922.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1922 The chain works had gone by 1950, and the wharf to the east of the section had become an engineering works. A paint works occupied most of the west side wharves.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1950 The engineering works had expanded to include the site of the chain works by the 1960s, when its chief activity was metal stamping,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1953-1965 and it remained so in 1969.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1969 To the north of the bridge, the 1851 map shows that the west bank contained Wharf Street Cotton Mill and four coal wharves, each with a weighing machine. On the east bank, there was a coal wharf with weighing machine, a fire brick yard, another coal wharf, most of which bordered onto another arm which turned back and ended close to Mill Street, and a third coal wharf on the side arm. By 1891, the area between Mill Street bridge and the side arm had been redeveloped and was occupied by a wire works, which included a small tramway, and the arm had been filled in. Between then and 1951, the maps do not indicate what was located there, but by 1951 there was an engineering works and a clothing factory. The engineering works was making lift equipment in 1953. Beyond the arm, the west bank contained Canal Street Dye Works and a dockyard with a dry dock in 1851. The end of the basin was quite large, and the Manchester Flint Glass Works was located beyond it. The eastern side of the basin is marked as a brick field, where clay would have been extracted. By 1891, the brick field had become a Bedstead and Safe Works, with an electric engineering works and St Jude's Church occupying the east side of the plot. The glass works had expanded to cover the former docks, and the basin had been reduced to a narrow finger. By 1951, the site to the north of the side arm was occupied by a shirt factory, the Corporation Cleansing Department's garage and an engineering works, where cylinder grinding and welding were carried out by 1953. The whole area north of Mill Street bridge had been redeveloped by the time the 1972/1981 map was published.Ordnance Survey, 1:10000 map, 1972-1981 See also *Canals of Great Britain *History of the British canal system References External links *Old OS map link showing location of branch Category:Canals in Manchester Category:Canals opened in 1801 ","title":"Islington Branch Canal"},{"id":"2186681","text":"Ketton is a village and civil parish in Rutland in the East Midlands of England. It is about east of Oakham and west of Stamford, Lincolnshire. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 1,926, making it the fourth largest settlement in Rutland, after Oakham, Uppingham and Cottesmore. The village has an outstanding primary school with 204 children currently on roll. Ketton gave its name to the Ketton Rural District of Rutland which existed from 1894 to 1974. Ketton ward, which also includes the parishes of Barrowden, Tinwell and Tixover has two councillors on Rutland County Council. Village Ketton was originally Chetene meaning \\"on the banks of the River Chater\\". It was originally three separate settlements: Ketton, Aldgate and Geeston; but as they grew they merged to form the village that Ketton is today. The village has a post office and general store, a library, two pubs (the Railway Inn and the Northwick Arms), a sports centre, a playschool and a Church of England primary school. The village has two churches (Church of England and Methodist). The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin are 12th century. The church has a central tower and spire. The west front is an example of late 12th century transitional architecture and the remainder of the church is mainly 13th century. The nave was restored under the direction of George Gilbert Scott in 1861‚Äì62 and the chancel under the direction of his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in 1863‚Äì66. Jackson's chancel roof was painted by Ninian Comper in 1950. The stone is from Barnack. There are Ketton headstones in the churchyard; one by the lychgate depicts mason's tools and is by stonemason William Hibbins of Ketton. William Hibbins built Hibbins House, which is still standing today. Robert of Ketton was the first person to translate the Qur'an into Latin. The translation was complete by 1143. Ketton stone and cement Ketton Quarry The village gives its name to Ketton stone, a limestone which is quarried locally and is used in many buildings in the village and elsewhere. Some areas of former quarrying are now a Site of Special Scientific Interest, maintained by Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The limestone is used to make cement. Ketton Cement Works opened in 1928 and by November that year the number of staff had risen to 250. The plant, owned by Hanson Cement (now part of HeidelbergCement), meets more than 10% of the UK demand for cement. In 2013 Rutland County Council approved plans for Lark Energy to build a solar farm on land reclaimed from a 1940s quarry. The solar farm provides 13% of the cement work's annual energy consumption. The second phase was opened by Secretary of State for Energy Amber Rudd. Wind energy in Ketton In 2004 Rutland County Council planning committee resolved to approve a planning application for one wind turbine on land adjacent to the cement works off Steadfold Lane in Ketton. However, issues surrounding fast jets flying from RAF Cottesmore meant that a planning permission was never granted. In 2011 REG Windpower announced plans to install two wind turbines near Steadfold Lane. The proposal was withdrawn in August 2012. Transport Ketton is served by buses on the service between Stamford and Uppingham. Ketton and Collyweston railway station closed in 1966.

In the movie, Louis de Fun√®s plays an industrialist named Bertrand Barnier who discovers over the course of a single day that his daughter is pregnant, he has been robbed by an employee, and various other calamities have befallen his household and his business. An English-language version of the movie was made in 1991, by John Landis, under the same name and starring Sylvester Stallone. Plot Christian Martin, a modest accountant in a large firm owned by Bertrand Barnier, surprises his boss by asking him for a 100% increase in his wages. Martin is on the point of proposing to a girl and doesn't want to ask for her hand in marriage while making a lowly accountant's salary. After Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he's stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm's accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm. Martin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier's daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank. While Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette. Without mentioning Martin, he tells her that he's opposed to her marriage which causes her to break down and cry. On the advice of her maid Bernadette, Colette lies to her father and tells him that she's pregnant by her lover. Hearing this, Barnier decides to approve the marriage and give the sixty million francs/jewelry to Colette as a wedding present. After Barnier's talk with Colette a young woman named Jacqueline Bouillotte comes to see him. She tells Barnier that she's in love with Christian Martin and that she lied to him and told him that she was Barnier's daughter. Barnier realizes that this means that Martin is not in love with his daughter Colette. It also dawns on him that he won‚Äôt be able to get his sixty million francs back from Martin or his daughter since they won‚Äôt be getting married. Upon confronting Colette, Barnier learns that she's in love with Oscar the chauffeur. At that moment Martin comes back from the bank and Barnier gets the jewelry, now in a black suitcase, from him. Martin then learns that Jacqueline has lied to him about being Barnier's daughter, which causes them to argue and break up. In the meantime Barnier has discovered that Oscar had joined a six-year polar expedition due to a \\"disappointment of love\\" (not being able to marry Colette.) Barnier tells Martin that he'll give him back the suitcase with the jewelry if he'll marry Colette. Martin hesitates and tries to put Barnier on to a new \\"pigeon\\": Philippe Dubois, Barnier's masseur. During this time, Colette's maid Bernadette announces her resignation and packs her suitcase; she is going to marry Colette's former fianc√© the Baron Honor√© de la Butini√®re. Before she leaves the house Bernadette puts down her suitcase filled with clothes and accidentally picks up the suitcase containing the sixty million francs worth of jewelry. Barnier tries to persuade his masseur to marry his daughter Colette, promising to give him the suitcase full of jewelry as a wedding present. Barnier almost has a heart attack when he opens the suitcase and finds clothes inside instead of jewels. At this point, Martin comes back and tells Barnier that before he had gone to the bank, while they were discussing giving the jewelry to Colette as a wedding present, he had hidden a piece of paper among the documents. When Barnier had signed an agreement to give Colette the jewelry, he had also signed a document giving Martin banking power of attorney. This allowed Martin to divert sixty million more francs from Barnier's accounts. Martin offers to exchange this second stolen sum for the jewelry representing the first stolen sum. Barnier gives Martin the suitcase with the jewelry thinking it's the suitcase full of clothes. However, unbeknownst to him Bernadette's driver had come back with the suitcase of jewelry and exchanged it for the suitcase of clothes. Barnier, thinking he's given Martin the clothes, invents an address for Jacqueline, Martin's true love, and sends him on his way. After a series of comic errors, Barnier again finds himself with Bernadette's suitcase full of clothes. After a funny telephone conversation with the Baron, Bernadette's new husband, Barnier recovers the suitcase filled with jewelry from Martin who has discovered that the address Barnier had given him for Jacqueline is wrong. Barnier, pleased to have finally recovered the suitcase filled with jewelry confesses to inventing the address to get rid of Martin and tells him that Jacqueline (who had come back earlier) is in fact in Barnier's office. While all of this is going on a lady named Charlotte enters the house. She's been sent by the employment agency to replace Bernadette as Colette's maid. She tells Barnier that when she was younger she worked for the Barnier family and that she had a daughter who is now engaged to a man named Christian Martin. Barnier realizes that the young woman being discussed is Jacqueline and Charlotte reveals that Jacqueline is in fact Charlotte and Barnier's daughter. Barnier needs several minutes to recover from the shock during which time Oscar returns home to Colette and all seems to end well. However...while everybody is congratulating each other, Bernadette arrives thinking that there has been a mistake with the suitcases. Not wanting to disturb anyone she inconspicuously exchanges the suitcases. Barnier asks Martin to open the now famous suitcase, thinking that he is going to take the jewelry out of it and give it to his daughters as a wedding present. He has an apoplectic fit on seeing that it's full of clothes. Everybody jumps in cars, on motorbikes, and on bicycles to go to Bernadette's and recover the suitcase of jewelry once and for all.

The population of the civil parish (including Teigh) was 494 at the 2001 census, increasing to 584 at the 2011 census. History The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. A Grade I listed building, it contains a Saxon arch and some carved stone from the Anglo-Saxon era, but most of the existing fabric is in the Perpendicular style, dating from the late 13th and early 14th century. The church, in the Diocese of Peterborough, is part of the Oakham team ministry. Hannah Ayscough, mother of Isaac Newton, was born in the village in 1623. The regicide Thomas Waite has been claimed to be a son of a village pub landlord. William Kitchen Parker, the zoologist, worked as a druggist's assistant to the village's doctor. The Market Store is a community shop, opened in May 2010. The village pub is the Black Bull Inn. There is a stocks with whipping post on the village green which was probably the location of the medieval market place. =Ironstone= There is a small industrial estate to the north of the village, where ironstone was mined from 1906-72 by James Pain Ltd, later becoming Stewarts & Lloyds then BSC Tubes Division. The brick terraced houses on the road to Thistleton were built for the workers. Access to the mine was by railway, which joined the Melton-Bourne railway at Pain's Sidings. More information is found at the Rutland Railway Museum. =Markon Engineering= The Markon Engineering company (derived from Stamford Engineering), was started in the village in 1959 by Messrs Fawkes and Knight, and moved to Oakham in 1960 then Dalcross near Inverness in 1969. They made electrical generators and were taken over by Newage Ltd in 1987. Generators of the Markon name are now made by Cummins Generator Technologies, based in Stamford. They now make two-pole single-phase capacitor-type alternators under the Markon name. Geography High Street with community shop The village is on the eastern side of an escarpment overlooking the Vale of Catmose. The area's subsoil is Upper Lias and Inferior Oolite. Most of the civil parish lies to the north and the east, including part of RAF Cottesmore (now Kendrew Barracks), but not the main runway. The boundary crosses Teigh Road at Netherfields where it borders Teigh. South of Hall Farm, it borders Wymondham and Leicestershire. The Oakham Canal passes through the west of the parish. The county boundary (and the Rutland Round) passes on the southern edge of Woodwell Head. It passes to the south of Pasture Farm and the southern edge of Cribb's Lodge (in Wymondham), where the parish boundary meets Thistleton. The former quarry extended into Thistleton at this point. The Rutland Round detours from the county boundary here through Leicestershire to meet the main road. The Black Bull pub in August 2005 Virtually all of the road to Thistleton is in the parish. It passes near to Thistleton just west of Top Farm (and Sewstern Lane). The former quarry extended to just north of the airfield. It briefly borders Greetham inside RAF Cottesmore, then borders Barrow. The village does not border Cottesmore and is around above sea level.

His life Born in ≈Ωamberk in northeastern Bohemia, Eben spent most of his childhood and early adolescence in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov in southern Bohemia. There he studied piano, and later cello and organ. The years of World War II were especially difficult for the young man. Although Eben was raised as a Catholic, his father was a Jew and thus fell foul of the National Socialist occupiers of his homeland. In 1943, aged 14, Eben was captured and imprisoned by the Nazis in Buchenwald, remaining there for the duration of the war. After being released, he was admitted to the Prague Academy for Music, and there he studied piano with Franti≈°ek Rauch and composition with Pavel Bo≈ôkovec. He graduated in 1954. Beginning in 1955 Eben taught for many years in the music history department at Charles University in Prague. Between 1977 and 1978 he was professor of composition at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester. In 1990 he became professor of composition in the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague and President of the Prague Spring Festival. Eben refused to join the Czech Communist Party and continued openly attending church, thus forfeiting many career advancements before 1989. After the Communist government crumbled, however, he was given several important appointments and awards, among them presidency of the Prague Spring Festival (1989) and the Medal of Merit (2002). Among Eben's most important late works is his 1992-1993 oratorio \\"Posv√°tn√° znamen√≠\\" (Sacred Symbols). Despite declining health from a stroke in his final years, Eben remained busy, composing mostly organ and choral works. He died in Prague on 24 October 2007. Eben's compositions are often performed in both Europe and overseas, especially in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. In 1991, Eben was awarded the title of Knight of the French Ministry of Culture, Arts and Letters. Two years earlier he became honorary president of the Society for Sacred Music. An international organ competition bearing his name has been organized since 2004 in Opava. The Petr Eben International Organ Competition, held in Opava, Czech Republic, is named in his honour. His son David Eben is the founder and director of Schola Gregoriana Pragensis, an a cappella male voice choir. Works Over more than half a century Eben produced a good deal of music in diverse genres. His earliest large works included his 1954 First Organ Concerto (the Second came in 1984) and Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1960‚Äì1961). He wrote numerous vocal, choral, symphonic, piano, and chamber works, but it was organ music which remained his greatest love and in which he was most prolific. Among Eben's biggest projects were the oratorio Apologia Socratus, the ballet Curse and Benediction (Kletby a dobro≈ôeƒçen√≠), written for the Holland Festival 1983, the orchestral works Hours of the Night (Noƒçn√≠ hodiny) and Prague Nocturne (Pra≈æsk√© nokturno), for the Vienna Philharmonic, the Organ Concerto No. 2 for the dedication of the new organ for Radio Vienna, the mass Missa cum populo for the Avignon Festival, the oratorio Holy Symbols (Posv√°tn√° znamen√≠) for Salzburg Cathedral, and the opera Jeremiah (intended for church, not theatrical, performance). He also wrote children's songs such as Sn√≠h, a song about snow which won an award for Best Children's Choir Song in Illinois. Eben was considered a master at improvisation on the organ and piano, but composition remained his main area of interest. However, many of his organ compositions in particular were based on his public improvisations. These improvisations were the origin for the Two Choral Fantasies, Landscapes of Patmos, and Job. Eben improvised and developed a cycle of organ movements in the years from 1991 to 2003 based on excerpts from John Comenius' famous book, Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart that became a published work in response to positive reception. His music has been widely performed and recorded since about 1980, with his popularity still apparently on the rise. Stylistically, his musical language can be considered as \\"neoexpressionistic\\" in many ways, however in some works we can hear some kind of new forms of impressionistic tendencies. He is often compared with Olivier Messiaen (the comparison is valid to some extent, in that both men wrote a great deal of organ music, and quite often have examples of their organ output included in the same recitals), but overall his style is less consistently experimental and voluptuous than Messiaen's. Recordings The majority of Eben's works has been published by Czech label Supraphon. Some recordings of his organ pieces were performed by himself. The Norwegian organist Halgeir Schiager has recorded five CDs of Petr Eben's organ music on Hyperion Records. The German organist Gunther Rost has recorded 6 discs of Petr Eben's organ music on label Motette. The interpretation recorded on this CD-SACD series was largely influenced by the composer's personal suggestions and comments. The series compiles all of Eben's works for solo organ which have been published to this date, played by Gunther Rost on various contemporary instruments. The speaker in both cycles, Job (vol. I) and The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart (vol. V, published in 2008), is Gert Westphal, one of Germany's most important contemporary reciters. Some of his CDs feature works by Sieglinde Ahrens. Petr Eben's Moto Ostinato from \\"Sunday Music\\" is played by English organist Gillian Weir in her \\"The King of Instruments\\" series (Priory Records' PRDVD 7001). The Canadian organist Philip Crozier, playing the Fulda Cathedral organ, has also recorded a number of Eben's works on the Azimuth label.

The population at the 2001 census was 329 falling slightly to 321 at the 2011 census. It is located about south-east of the county town of Oakham on the A47 and A6121 roads. A prominent reconstructed windmill can be seen from both East and West-bound approaches to Morcott along the A47. Rutland County Council designated Morcott a Conservation Area in 1981, one of 34 conservation areas in Rutland which are \\"of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\". Location and setting Rutland County Council documents describe Morcott as a moderately sized, compact and attractive Rutland village four miles to the east of the nearest town, Uppingham located in undulating, open countryside, approximately 75 metres above sea level on the north facing slope of a tributary of the River Chater. =Historical development= The village name is an Old English derivation of \\"a cottage on the moor\\". The village is recorded as Morcote in the Domesday survey of 1086 and formed part of the king's manor of Barrowden. The village served the manorial interests of several different ownerships but passed to the Fydell Rowley family in the early 19th century. The Church of St Mary is the defining landmark in the village and is regarded as the most complete Norman church in Rutland. The historic origins of the village is associated with agriculture and has resulted in a legacy of good, stone built farmhouses, cottages and outbuildings. Although none of the surviving houses are believed to date from earlier than the 17th century, the style of many of the buildings and the dated examples indicate that Morcott shared in a period of transformation in the 17th and 18th centuries that reflected wider economic prosperity, based on growing demand and improvements in agriculture, notably in crop rotation and the wealth generated by sheep farming, that occurred in large parts of rural middle England at that time. The historic importance of a number of the buildings within the village is reflected in there being 30 entries on the National Heritage List for England. Outside of the village, but within the parish, the windmill on Barrowden Road is a prominent landmark in views from the conservation area and surrounding countryside. The defunct Morcott railway station on the branch line between Seaton and Luffenham closed in 1966. The road bridge which carries the High Street over the old railway cutting is a skew arch containing construction features rarely seen. =Buildings of local importance= St Mary the Virgin, the parish church, is a Grade I listed building. The Norman church features a 'pancake' window on the west side, and a north arcade considered to be 'the best example of Norman work in the area'. In 2014 Rutland County Council cited additional buildings to those statutorily listed, 'as contributing to the character of the village' in the Morcott Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Proposal. These additions included a row of estate workers' houses on Fydell Row, a prominent pair of 19th-century farmhouses on the High Street, and the Village Hall - formerly a Baptist chapel rebuilt in 1903 in the Arts and Crafts style. Morcott Hall was an independent girls' school for 25 years but is now again a private house. Businesses Until the early 2000s a Post Office and small shop was open in the village. Once this closed the village was mainly served by the two petrol stations locally, the social enterprise the Barrowden & Wakerley Community Shop, and local towns Uppingham, Oakham, and Stamford. The nearest cities are Peterborough to the east, and Leicester to the west, both accessible by train from Oakham. The White Horse Inn (currently (2019) closed) on Stamford Road is an historic coaching inn at the junction of Stamford Road and High Street and forms an attractive entrance to the east end of the village. It houses a plaque to 1982 Grand National winner Grittar, whose owner Frank Gilman lived in the parish. In the 21st century, changes in licence owners has seen it closed by Punch Taverns for long periods. A long-term closure in the mid 2010s paved the way for redevelopment of the village's Little Chef, which was also closed even though it supported passing trade from the busy A47, two petrol stations, two garages, and a Travelodge hotel; giving the village a new cafe restaurant, the Country Lounge. The former Travelodge now operates as a Redwings Lodge.

Route The canal left the main line of the Ashton Canal at Stockport Junction (otherwise Clayton Junction), between locks 10 and 11 at Clayton, and it terminated at Stockport Basin just beyond the top of Lancashire Hill. It was just less than five miles long (7.87 km) and it was lock free. It went through Gorton, Abbey Hey and Reddish and it opened for trade in 1797. At Reddish, it was intended that a further branch (the Beat Bank Branch Canal) would be built, and work actually began on construction of this branch. Only an isolated section of that branch was ever built, and it never connected with the Stockport Branch. Features The canal was for the most part urban, being heavily industrialised along most of its length. Between Clayton and Gorton there was a heavy concentration of engineering factories and ironworks as well as the Canal Company‚Äôs Depot at Gorton. Beyond Gorton, all the way through Reddish, cotton mills predominated. Working life The main line of the Ashton Canal had been authorised by Act of Parliament in June 1792, and in March 1793 the Proprietors obtained a second Act, which authorised a branch to Stockport, a branch which would leave the Stockport branch at Reddish and run along the Tame Valley to Beat Bank to serve some coal mines at Haughton Green, and a separate branch to Hollinwood. The Act authorised the Proprietors to raise an additional ¬£30,000, with which to fund all three branches. Although the Company advertised for an engineer, they did not find one, and their agent James Meadows probably oversaw the construction. The Hollinwood branch was finished first, in late 1796, but the Stockport branch opened soon afterwards, in January 1797. With good supplies of coal from the mines at Werneth which the Hollinwood branch served, and difficulties in building the Beat Bank branch due to it being on a clay slope, the Company decided to abandon further work on the Beat Bank branch, and notified William Hulton, the owner of the collieries at Denton, that they could not afford to continue. An Act to formally abandon it was sought in 1798, and although opposed by Hulton, it was obtained. In the same year, the Canal Company built warehouses at Stockport, and wharves were allocated there to assist the Werneth Colliery to sell its coal, and thus generate more traffic on the canal. With the coming of the railways, traffic fell, and dividends had dropped to 6 per cent by 1842. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway offered to buy the canal for an annual payment of ¬£12,364, which would give the shareholders a 7 per cent return, and with a further payment of ¬£540 per year to fund interest payments on debts, the Canal Company accepted gratefully in 1846. The takeover was formalised by an Act of Parliament in 1848, which required the Railway Company to maintain the canal in good order. This they did for many years, running their own boats for the carriage of goods until 1892. The Canal Company was wound up in 1883, and the shareholders were given shares in the Railway Company. The canal was principally used to carry general cargo, such as supplying raw cotton to the mills and returning with manufactured goods. It also carried coal for the mills and the townsfolk who lived in the neighbourhood. Another important cargo was the supply of grain to William Nelstrop & Company‚Äôs Albion Corn Mill at Stockport Basin. In its early days there was passenger carrying on the Ashton Canal and one of the routes was between Manchester and Stockport. Decline and closure The canal began to decline as a result of competition from railways and roads, and was described as derelict as early as 1922. Commercial carrying ceased in the 1930s but it lingered on into the 1950s as a barely navigable waterway. At one stage in the 1950s it was dredged but this improvement did not attract any traffic. Stockport Basin was the first section to be filled in but it was not until 1962 that the canal was officially abandoned by the British Transport Commission, who had been responsible for it since 1948. It took many years to fill in and this was a disagreeable procedure for people living along its length. Restoration movement Much of the line of the former canal remains intact and there are now plans to re-open it as an amenity canal; these plans have the support of local authorities. Scott states that a British Waterways report indicates that reopening the canal is technically feasible.

Once the highest structure of that city's kremlin, it used to be one of the so-called leaning towers. By 1990s, the inclination was . Diverse stabilization methods were used to straighten the tower in the 1930s and 1990s, and it no longer leans. The tower's construction date is enshrouded in mystery. Several scholars date its construction to the turn of the 18th century, when tiered towers were exceedingly popular in Russia. S√∂yembik√§ Tower is constructed in six tiers to the height of A legend postulates that the tower was built more than a century earlier by Ivan the Terrible's artisans in just a week's time. As the legend goes, the Kazan queen S√∂yembik√§ threw herself down from the highest tier, hence the name. This legend has nothing to do with the real history of the tower because S√∂yembik√§ was forcibly detained by Muscovite forces in 1551 and moved to the city of Kasimov and died years later (and suicide is an unpardonable sin in the queen's Muslim faith). The legend was popular since the early 18th century. Some even go as far as stating that the tower is the only extant structure from the pre-Russian Tatar citadel. If the tower really reflects some original features of Tatar architecture, then its design should have certainly influenced that of the Kremlin towers in Moscow. Supporters of the theory point out that the only similar structures were built in Central Asia, which was politically and culturally connected with the derelict Khanate of Kazan. Several facts point to the validity of this theory: the size of the masonry, the absence of documentary evidence supporting Russian building, the respect paid to the tower by the local Tatar population, and so forth. In the Imperial period, the tower used to be topped with a double-headed eagle, which the Bolsheviks replaced with a red star. It is currently crowned with a Muslim crescent. In the early twentieth century, the architect Alexey Shchusev reproduced the structure's outline in the Kazan Rail Station of Moscow.

The stable block of their hall is now Normanton Park hotel. In the 18th century the village was cleared to make a park for the estate of the Heathcote family with the population mainly re- housed in Empingham. In the 1970s much of the parish was flooded by the construction of the Rutland Water reservoir. St Matthew's Church is a Grade II listed building, built in classical style. The tower and the western portico were built by Thomas Cundy Jr between 1826 and 1829, based on the design of St John's, Smith Square in Westminster, while the nave and apse were constructed in 1911, by J. B. Gridley of London. Church of St Matthew, Normanton The building was once the private chapel for the Normanton Estate, but it was de- consecrated in 1970, and was to have been demolished as part of the reservoir construction, as its floor was below the proposed water level. Following a public outcry, the lower half was filled with stone and rubble, and a concrete cap constructed just below the level of the windows. An embankment was built around the church leaving it a prominent feature on the water's edge.

The packaging is characterised by a distinctive stark white packet with the brand name in a purple, blue, red, silver, white or green square. History Silk Cut was launched in 1964. In the past, Silk Cut cigarettes contained approximately 75% tobacco, the rest of the filling being Cytrel, a cellulose-based tobacco substitute. In present day the addition of Cytrel has been abandoned, making the cigarette additive-free. The brand increased in popularity around the world throughout the 1970s and 1980s as the dangers of cigarette smoking became well known and consumers switched to a lower tar brand. At 5 mg tar, Silk Cut contained less than half the tar content of stronger brands such as Benson and Hedges or Marlboro. Production company Gallaher held a Royal Warrant of Appointment for 122 years, until the warrant was revoked in 1999 by Queen Elizabeth II. Her son, the Prince of Wales' rigorous anti-smoking campaigning is thought to have been a major influence behind that decision. Gallaher was allowed one year to remove the Royal Coat of Arms from the brand's packaging. Silk Cut is also available in a lower tar version and an ultra low tar version with a tar content of only 0.1 mg. When terms such as 'light' and 'low tar' were made illegal to use in the UK for use of tobacco promotion (for fear that it deluded smokers into thinking such products were safer), some commentators predicted that Silk Cut's name and good brand-recognition as a low-tar product would favourably affect sales of the brand to health-conscious consumers. Silk Cut Blue cigarettes contain 0.3 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 3 mg. Silk Cut Silver cigarettes contain 0.1 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 1 mg. Silk Cut White cigarettes contain 0.01 mg Nicotine and Tar content is 0.5 mg. Silk Cut cigarettes are also available in a '100s' range (superking) along with a Menthol flavoured cigarette, too. It is a misconception that the tobacco in Silk Cuts contains less nicotine than other cigarette tobacco. The lower nicotine levels are caused by the design of the filter, which has many more holes than regular strength cigarette filters, to mix the smoke with air. In 2013, limited edition packs of Silk Cut cigarettes were introduced to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Advertising campaigns In the 1970s, Silk Cut was advertised in several popular cinema advertisements, including a parody of the defence of Rorke's Drift, as portrayed in the film Zulu, and of British POWs escaping from a German prison camp. The brand was also made popular by a surrealistic advertising campaign launched in 1984, in preparation for a ban on named tobacco advertising. By using the typical colours of the brand, the first surrealistic advertisement of Silk Cut showed a purple silk cloth with a single cut running through it, showing behind it a white background. The name of the cigarette brand never appears on this advertisement, nor are any other objects linked to smoking visible, such as packs of cigarettes or smoke. The only hint for the viewer that this advertisement concerns a cigarette brand at all is the mandatory health warning at the bottom. Based on a series of works by avantgardist artist Lucio Fontana, this first advertisement represented a wordplay on the brand name Silk Cut. This kind of understated advertisement brought together art and life and was unprecedented except for a similar, but not as daring Benson and Hedges campaign in the 1970s. The campaign went on to be a huge success, even making Silk Cut the best-selling brand at the beginning of the 1990s. Silk Cut went on to produce many more advertisements in this style, playing with surrealistic themes and pop cultural references, like Man Ray's \\"Cadeau\\" as well as Alfred Hitchcock's famous shower curtain scene from the movie \\"Psycho\\"(1960). In later parts of the campaign they also created original surrealistic themes for the ads. The main idea behind the use of surrealism for an advertising campaign was to catch the attention of the viewer by giving him or her a riddle to solve, i.e. guessing what product or brand was actually advertised. Only those who could link the images would eventually come to the conclusion that this is an advertisement for the cigarette brand Silk Cut. This worked as a rewarding sensation for the viewer, attaching positive emotions (for successfully solving the riddle) with the brand. But it was also possible to interpret darker and sexual themes into the images of the campaign, even though this was most likely not intended.Art and Advertising, p. 64 After a running time of almost two decades, the final poster in the series was in 2002 when all tobacco advertising in the UK was finally banned and showed an opera singer, wearing a purple silk dress which had split at the seams - a reference to the saying 'It's not over until the fat lady sings'. However, sales of Silk Cut cigarettes continued to grow even after the campaign had ended, thanks to sport sponsorship and to many special edition packs, as well as changes on the pack shape, texture, style of opening, cellophane, foil and inner frame. The market share grew 1.1% from 2004 to 2008, and a further 2.9% from 2008 to 2011. Sport sponsorship Silk Cut sponsored Jaguar XJR-9 for Jaguar's sportscar efforts except in North America because of IMSA's tobacco ban, where Castrol was sponsor. Silk Cut were the title sponsors of rugby league's Challenge Cup for 16 years, between 1985 and 2001, and the competition was known as the 'Silk Cut Challenge Cup'. Silk Cut also sponsored the successful Jaguar XJR sportscars that competed in World Sportscar Championship, including the 24 Heures du Mans, but not in North America because of IMSA's title sponsorship of the GT series by R. J. Reynolds' Camel brand, which would have run the team in violation of the \\"Viceroy Rule\\". It is now illegal to advertise tobacco in many countries and the adverts have stopped. In the 1990s Silk Cut was the best selling brand in the UK, but sales have declined behind cheaper budget brands as tax on tobacco has increased. In an attempt to counteract this, the manufacturers responded in the new millennium by introducing bevelled corners to redesigned regular gauge packaging, and marketing their first 'slim' cigarette in the UK, even though this wasn't the first 'slim' cigarette available in the UK as More, Karelia and Vogue are available in most tobacconists. Capri were available in the UK until the mid-1990s. Controversy =JTI battling future UK plain packaging law= In 2013, JTI announced it would fight the future introduction of plain packaging laws in the United Kingdom. Gallaher Group, which includes Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut among its brands and is part of tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), is campaigning against Government plans to force cigarettes to be sold in plain packages. In March 2013, Gallaher had three ads challenging the Government's proposals for plain cigarette packaging banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, after complaints from ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) and Cancer Research. The ASA found the ads were \\"misleading\\" and lacking \\"substantiation\\". Jorge da Motta, the managing director of JTI UK, said: \\"We are using this media campaign to demonstrate that in 2011, even the Department of Health accepted that these proposals are not supported by any hard evidence. We hope common sense will prevail and that the Government will disregard this proposal, before embarking on a process which will do nothing more than deprive the Treasury of much-needed revenue and make hundreds of millions of pounds for the criminals who manufacture, distribute and sell illegal tobacco products. We have always argued that plain packaging will not prevent children from smoking, but enforcing existing initiatives such as 'No ID, No Sale', punishing those who buy tobacco on the behalf of children and cutting the illegal supply chain, can work\\". Markets Silk Cut is mainly sold in the United Kingdom. It was or is exported to Ireland, the Channel Islands, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Malta, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hong Kong, Australia, United States and Antigua.

It is the administrative centre of the Feldkirch district. After Dornbirn, it is the second most populous town in Vorarlberg. The westernmost point in Austria lies in Feldkirch on the river Rhine, at the tripoint between Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. History This beautiful medieval town, which remains well preserved to this day, was mentioned as a city for the first time in 1218, after Count Hugo von Montfort built the \\"Schattenburg\\", a castle which still is the major landmark of Feldkirch. Other sights in the town include the Gothic-style cathedral of St. Nikolaus. Feldkirch was the birthplace of Rheticus, and is currently the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Feldkirch. From 1651‚Äì1773 and from 1856‚Äì1979, Feldkirch was the home of the Jesuit school Stella Matutina. March 1799 saw two clashes between the forces of the First French Republic and the Habsburg Monarchy. On the 7th, Nicolas Oudinot, with 9,000 French soldiers, defeated Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze and his 6,000 Austrians. The Battle of Feldkirch occurred on 23 March, when Andr√© Mass√©na and 12,000 Frenchmen were beaten by Franz Jellacic and a force of 5,500 Austrians.  Town subdivisions * Feldkirch * Altenstadt * Gisingen * Levis * Nofels * Tisis *Tosters Population  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = Feldkirch has had its own local bus network since 1993. It currently consists of eight lines, including buses which run to the north of neighbouring Liechtenstein. The bus system cooperates with Vorarlberg's regional bus system. The Feldkirch railway station lies on the main railway line through the Vorarlberg, with inter-city services to Zurich and Vienna. There are also local international trains to Buchs via Liechtenstein on the Feldkirch‚ÄìBuchs railway. = Companies = The following companies and service organizations are based in Feldkirch: * Bachmann Electronic * Vorarlberg Milch * Market place in the city of FeldkirchLingenh√∂le Technologie * Stadtwerke Feldkirch * KSW Tankstellen- und Industrieanlagenbau * Geb√§udereinigung Bauer * Landeskrankenhaus Feldkirch  Culture and landmarks  = Central Feldkirch = Feldkirch has one of the best preserved medieval townscapes of Vorarlberg. The town was built around 1200 and has a geometric grid system. Since around 1500, when the city wall was rebuilt, the city has remained unchanged over the centuries. Since 2015, the Feldkirch Municipal Ensemble has been listed in the Austrian List of Cultural Heritage (cultural property protected by the Hague Convention). The city is also a member of the Association of Small Historic Towns, a tourism marketing association. = City fortification = The streets of the Schlossgraben, Hirschgraben and St. Leonhardsplatz marked the former course of the city wall surrounding the Neustadt area in the 13th century. The wall was largely rebuilt around 1500, and torn down in many places beginning in 1826. When Feldkirch was surrounded by a city wall and a city moat, one could enter the city only through one of its four gates. These city gates were called Bregenzertor or Nikolaustor, Bludenzertor or Schultor, Milltor or Sautor, and Churertor or Salztor. The last two gates are still standing, the other two were removed together with the city wall at the beginning of the 19th century. = Castles and palaces = * The Schattenburg in FeldkirchSchattenburg: The Schattenburg castle was the seat of the counts of Montfort until 1390. The first construction phase began around 1230 under Hugo I of Montfort, the founder of the city. Under Count Friedrich von Toggenburg (1416‚Äì1436) and under the Vogt Hans of K√∂nigsegg extensions and transformations of the Schattenburg castle were built in the 15th century. After the counts lost their power, the castle was repeatedly put up for auction, and was even to be demolished in 1813. Since 1825 the castle has been owned by the town of Feldkirch, which at that time acquired it for 833 florins. The castle then served as barracks, and later as accommodation for the poor. The castle owes its rescue and revitalization to the Museum and Homeland Security Association for Feldkirch and the Surrounding Area which was founded in 1912. The upper floors are home to a museum of local history that attracts about 25,000 visitors annually. * Ruins of Tosters: The ruins of a hill castle on a hillside part of the Schellenberg, in the Feldkirch district of Tosters. * Palais Liechtenstein: In today's form, the house was built in the Schlossergasse No. 8 after the town fire of 1697, as an office building for the prince Johann Adam Andreas of Liechtenstein in Baroque style. In 1848 it became the property of Andreas Ritter of Tschavoll, at that time Feldkirch mayor and manufacturer. The town acquired the palais in 1967 and today the building is used as an exhibition centre. It is home of the cultural council, and also the seat of the city library and the city archives. = Villas and other residential buildings = In the 19th century the Feldkirch bourgeoisie built a number of prestigious residential buildings, most of which are still privately owned. The villas were built mostly on the Reichsstra√üe, mainly in the area between the B√§renkreuzung and the train station. = Cultural events = The Poolbar Festival is a modern music and cultural festival in Feldkirch. Held annually in July and August, it attracts around 20,000 visitors; it features music, exhibitions, poetry slams, fashion and an architectural prize. It was first held in 1994 as a cultural summer-academy and is, in its organization and implementation of landscape and architecture, very different from other open-air events. The light art festival Lichtstadt Feldkirch lets international artists fill the city of Feldkirch with light objects, projections and sculptures. Its first edition was held in 2018 and attracted 30.000 visitors. The festival will take place every other year. The POTENTIALe (formerly 'ArtDesign Feldkirch') is an art fair and festival at which about 110 exhibitors present their products and ideas. In addition to a vintage market, there are workshops and discussion groups, a design laboratory, photography exhibitions, and music and films are presented. The aim of the festival is to establish a network of artists, craftsmen and customers that share the common vision of sustainable design. The Feldkirch Festival (2001-2012) was an annual summer festival that offered theater performances, concerts and other cultural events.  Climate  Feldkirch has a oceanic climate (Cfb).

Inter-dining refers to the act of dining within one's own caste, and excluding others. The practice of Anna Dharmam may have emerged in association with inter-dining. Origin Inter-dining was an important activity that originated in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. People of different castes would travel bringing with them food materials for cooking their meals when they came to meet Ayya Vaikundar. Food, with its ritual significance, was distributed to the needy and to all those gathered around Ayya Vaikundar. They cooked and ate in the presence of Ayya Vaikundar. This common place action evolved into a significant practice of inter-dining between persons of different groups, cutting across the boundaries of caste restrictions. This practice, being performed in a religious setting with certain measure of earnestness and respect, seems to have acquired the character of a ritual too. Unpan Annam Today, the food being served as Anna Dharmam is known as Unpan Annam, literally meaning \\"the food to be eaten,\\" and it has its own specific method of preparation. Rice, vegetables, and spices are cooked and mixed together for the purpose. Then it is served ceremoniously. When it is served, the partakers wait until everyone is served. Then a question is posed customarily by the partakers: \\"Ayya annam kutikkalama ?\\" (Ayya, may we eat the meal?) and when it is answered by those who serve as \\"Ayya annam kutiyunkal\\" (You may kindly eat the meal), the partakers eat the meal. This was to ensure that everyone got the meal. The poor and the rich - all partake of this meal without discrimination. It was considered as a religious virtue to partake of this meal. Another variant of Anna Dharmam known as Palvaippu, the serving of 'gruel-like food boiled in milk.' Presently, every center of worship of Ayyavazhi has this practice once a month. Anna Dharmam in one form or the other is a daily feature in most of the worship centres of Ayyavazhi, For instance, Swamithoppe practice it daily.

Alternative names include folk football, mob football and Shrovetide football. These games may be regarded as the ancestors of modern codes of football, and by comparison with later forms of football, the medieval matches were chaotic and had few rules. The Middle Ages saw a rise in popularity of games played annually at Shrovetide throughout Europe, particularly in Great Britain. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the Roman occupation but there is little evidence to indicate this. Certainly the Romans played ball games, in particular Harpastum. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain. In the ninth century Nennius's Historia Brittonum tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (pilae ludus).Magoun, Francis Peabody (1929). \\"Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature.\\" The American Historical Review, vol 35, No. 1. The origin of this account is either Southern England or Wales. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played in towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. Sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents' church. These games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of \\"kicking the Dane's head\\". These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1835/50/pdfs/ukpga_18350050_en.pdf In spite of this, games continued to be played in some parts of the United Kingdom and still survive in a number of towns, notably the Ba game played at Christmas and New Year at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands Scotland, Uppies and Downies over Easter at Workington in Cumbria, and the Royal Shrovetide Football Match on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday at Ashbourne in Derbyshire, England. Few images of medieval football survive. One engraving from the early fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards each other with a ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.Marples, Morris (1954). A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of \\"ball play\\" or \\"playing at ball\\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked. History The earliest account of ball games being played in post-classical Europe comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to the monk Nennius. The text, written in Wales, mentions a group of boys \\"playing at ball\\" (pilae ludus).Historia Brittonum, ch. 41. The earliest reference from France which provides evidence of the playing of ball games (presumably La soule) comes in 1147. This refers to the handing over of \\"seven balloons of greatest dimension\\". An early description of ball games that are likely to be football in England was given by William FitzStephen (c. 1174 ‚Äì 1183). He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday: The earliest confirmation that such ball games in England involved kicking comes from a verse about Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. This was probably written in the thirteenth century, being recorded by Matthew Paris, although the precise date is not known: \\"Four and twenty bonny boys, were playing at the ball.. he kicked the ball with his right foot\\". In about 1200 \\"ball\\" is mentioned as one of the games played by King Arthur's knights in \\"Brut\\", written by Layamon, an English poet from Worcestershire. This is the earliest reference to the English language \\"ball\\". Layamon states: \\"some drive balls (balles) far over the fields\\". Records from 1280 report on a game at Ulgham, near Ashington in Northumberland, in which a player was killed as a result of running against an opposing player's dagger. This account is noteworthy because it is the earliest reference to an English ball game that definitely involved kicking; this suggests that kicking was involved in even earlier ball games in England. In Cornwall in 1283 plea rolls No. 111. mention a man named Roger who was accused of striking a fellow player in a game of soule with a stone, a blow which proved fatal.Medieval Cornwall by L. E. Elliot-Binns. =14th century= The earliest reference to ball games being played by university students comes in 1303 when \\"Thomas of Salisbury, a student of Oxford University, found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate\\". In 1314, comes the earliest reference to a game called football when Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree on behalf of King Edward II banning football. It was written in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \\"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\\" Another early account of kicking ball games from England comes in a 1321 dispensation, granted by Pope John XXII to William de Spalding of Shouldham: \\"To William de Spalding, canon of Scoldham of the order of Sempringham. During the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his, also called William, ran against him and wounded himself on a sheathed knife carried by the canon, so severely that he died within six days. Dispensation is granted, as no blame is attached to William de Spalding, who, feeling deeply the death of his friend, and fearing what might be said by his enemies, has applied to the pope.\\" Banning of ball games began in France in 1331 by Philip VI, presumably the ball game known as La soule. Youths playing ball depicted on a misericord at Gloucester Cathedral. In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows two young men playing a ball game. It looks as though they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking certainly cannot be excluded. Most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used. King Edward III of England also issued such a declaration, in 1363: \\"[m]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\\". At this time football was already being differentiated in England from handball, which suggests the evolution of basic rules. Between 1314 and 1667, football was officially banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws. (See the article Attempts to ban football games for more details.) Likewise Geoffrey Chaucer offered an allusion to the manner in which contemporary ball games may have been played in fourteenth-century England. In the Canterbury Tales (written some time after 1380) he uses the following line: \\"rolleth under foot as doth a ball\\".https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/cbtls12.txt English Theologian John Wycliffe (1320‚Äì1384) referred to football in one of his sermons: \\"and now √æei clouten √æer shone wi√æ censuris, as who shulde chulle a foot-balle\\"Sermon XIX // Select English Works of John Wyclif. Edited by Thomas Arnold. ‚Äì Vol. II. ‚Äì Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1871. ‚Äì 423 pp. - P. 280. It may be the earliest use of the word football in English. =15th century= That football was known at the turn of the century in Western England comes from about 1400 when the West Midland Laud Troy War Book states in English: \\"Hedes reled aboute overal As men playe at the fote-ball\\" Two references to football games come from Sussex in 1403 and 1404 at Selmeston and Chidham as part of baptisms. On each occasion one of the players broke his legMarples, Morris (1954). A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London, p36 King Henry IV of England provides an early documented use of the English word \\"football\\" when in 1409 he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \\"foteball\\". On 4 March 1409, eight men were compelled to give a bond of ¬£20 to the London city chamberlain for their good behaviour towards \\"the kind and good men of the mystery of Cordwainers\\", undertaking not to collect money for a football (pro pila pedali). In 1410, King Henry IV of England found it necessary to impose a fine of 20S on mayors and bailiffs in towns where misdemeanours such as football occurred. This confirms that football was not confined to London. The Accounts of the Worshipful Company of Brewers between 1421 and 1423 concerning the hiring out of their hall include reference to \\"by the \\"footeballepleyers\\" twice... 20 pence\\" listed in English under the title \\"crafts and fraternities\\". This reference suggests that bans against football were unsuccessful and the listing of football players as a \\"fraternity\\" is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club. The earliest reference to football or kicking ball games in Scotland was in 1424 when King James I of Scotland also attempted to ban the playing of \\"fute-ball\\". In 1425 the prior of Bicester, England, made a payment on St Katherine's day \\"to sundry gifts to football players (ludentibus ad pilam pedalem)\\" of 4 denarii. At this time the prior was willing to give his patronage to the game despite its being outlawed. In about 1430 Thomas Lydgate refers to the form of football played in East Anglia known as Camp Ball: \\"Bolseryd out of length and bread, lyck a large campynge balle\\" In 1440 the game of Camp Ball was confirmed to be a form of football when the first ever English-Latin dictionary, Promptorium parvulorum offers the following definition of camp ball: \\"Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion\\". In 1472 the rector of Swaffham, Norfolk bequeathed a field adjoining the church yard for use as a \\"camping-close\\" or \\"camping-pightel\\" specifically for the playing of the East Anglian version of football known as Camp Ball.Marples, Morris (1954). A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London, p37 In 1486 comes the earliest description of \\"a football\\", in the sense of a ball rather than a game.\\"football\\" at EtymOnline.com This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans. It states: \\"a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.\\" It was considered socially acceptable for a football to be included in medieval English Heraldry. There is an account from 11 April 1497 of a sum of money \\"giffen [given] to Jame Dog [James Doig] to b[u]y fut ballis to the King\\".. It is not known if he himself played with them. The earliest and perhaps most important description of a football game comes from the end of the 15th century in a Latin account of a football game with features of modern soccer. It was played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire, England. It is included in a manuscript collection of the miracles of King Henry VI of England. Although the precise date is uncertain it certainly comes from between 1481 and 1500. This is the first account of an exclusively \\"kicking game\\" and the first description of dribbling: \\"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions\\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football field, stating that: \\"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started. Nevertheless the game was still rough, as the account confirms: \\"a game, I say, abominable enough . . . and rarely ending but with some loss, accident, or disadvantage of the players themselves.\\" Medieval sport had no referee.Olmert, Michael (1996). Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History, p.85. Simon & Schuster, New York. . =16th century= In 1510 comes the next description of early football by Alexander Barclay, a resident of the South East of England: > They get the bladder and blowe it great and thin, with many beanes and > peason put within, It ratleth, shineth and soundeth clere and fayre, While > it is throwen and caste up in the eyre, Eche one contendeth and hath a great > delite, with foote and hande the bladder for to smite, if it fall to the > ground they lifte it up again... Overcometh the winter with driving the > foote-ball. The first record of a pair of football boots occurs when Henry VIII of England ordered a pair from the Great Wardrobe in 1526. The royal shopping list for footwear states: \\"45 velvet pairs and 1 leather pair for football\\".\\"Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?\\" The Guardian Accessed 2010‚Äì06‚Äì13 Unfortunately these are no longer in existence. It is not known for certain whether the king himself played the game, but if so this is noteworthy as his son Edward VI later banned the game in 1548 because it incited riots. The reputation of football as a violent game persists throughout most accounts from 16th-century England. In 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot noted in his Boke named The Governour the dangers of football, as well as the benefits of archery (\\"shooting\\"): > Some men wolde say, that in mediocritie, whiche I haue so moche praised in > shootynge, why shulde nat boulynge, claisshe, pynnes, and koytyng be as > moche commended? Verily as for two the laste, be to be utterly abiected of > al noble men, in like wise foote balle, wherin is nothinge but beastly furie > and extreme violence; wherof procedeth hurte, and consequently rancour and > malice do remaine with them that be wounded; wherfore it is to be put in > perpetuall silence.

Although many sixteenth-century references to football are disapproving or dwell upon their dangers there are two notable departures from this view. First, Sir Thomas Elyot (although previously a critic of the game) advocates \\"footeball\\" as part of what he calls vehement exercise in his Castell of Helth published in 1534.Marples, Morris (1954). A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London, p66 Secondly English headmaster Richard Mulcaster provides in his 1581 publication the earliest evidence of organised, refereed football for small teams playing in formation. The first reference to football in Ireland occurs in the Statute of Galway of 1527, which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned \\" 'hokie' ‚Äî the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\\" as well as other sports. (The earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712.) The oldest surviving ball that might have been used for football games dates to about 1540 and comes from Scotland. It is made from leather and a pig's bladder. It was discovered in 1981 in the roof structure of the Queen's Chamber, Stirling Castle. Whilst other uses for the ball, such as pallone, have been suggested, most notably by the National Museum of Scotland, due to its size (diameter 14‚Äì16 cmVisitScotland official website ), staff at the Stirling Smith Museum and researchers at the Scottish Football Museum have attributed its use to football, citing the description of the ball used in the Carlisle Castle game of 1568.Inglis Simon; A Load of Old Balls, English Heritage, 2005, P20. The violence of early football in Scotland is made clear in this sixteenth-century poem on the \\"beauties of football\\": The earliest specific reference to football (pila pedalis) at a university comes in 1555 when it was outlawed at St John's College, Oxford. Similar decrees followed shortly after at other Oxford Colleges and at Cambridge University. Another reference occurred in 1555, when Antonio Scaino published his treatise Del Giuoco della Palla (On the Game of the Ball). It was mostly concerned with a medieval predecessor of tennis, but near the end, Scaino included a chapter titled, \\"Del Giuoco del Calcio\\" (\\"On the Game of Football\\"), for comparison. According to Scaino, the game was popular with students. It could be played with any number of players. The only rules seem to be that weapons could not be brought onto the field, and the ball could not be thrown by hand. The goal was for each team to try to cross the ball across a marked space at the opposite end of the field. To start, the ball was placed in the middle of the field and kicked by a member of the team that was chosen by lots. Scaino remarks that its chief entertainment for the spectators was to see \\"the players fall in great disarray & upside down.\\"Scaino, Antonio. Trattato del Giuoco della Palla. Trans. P. A. Negretti. London: Raquetier Productions Ltd., 1984. In 1568 Sir Francis Knollys described a football game played at Carlisle Castle, Cumbria, England by the retinue of Mary Queen of Scots: \`20 of her retinue played at football before her for two hours very strongly, nimbly, and skilfully\\". According to contemporary sources and detailed publications Mary's retinue was predominantly Scottish, made up primarily by nobles who had followed her south in the aftermath of the Battle of Langside.Letter written by Sir Francis Knollys to Secretary Cecil, on 2 June 1568, and published in Anderson, James; Collections Relating to the History of Mary Queen of Scotland, Vol IV, Part I. London, 1728. Pp62-63.Keith, Rev Robert; History of the affairs of church and state in Scotland from the beginning of the reformation to the year 1568, Vol 2, Edinburgh, 1844. P827. The first official rules of Calcio Fiorentino (Florentine kick) were recorded in 1580, although the game had been developing around Florence for some time before that date. The game involved teams of 27 kicking and carrying a ball in a giant sandpit set up in the Piazza Santa Croce in the centre of Florence, both teams aiming for their designated point on the perimeter of the sandpit.Halpern, J. Balls and Blood, Sports Illustrated. Vol 109, No. 4: August 4, 2008, p. 42. In 1586, men from a ship commanded by English explorer John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.Richard Hakluyt, Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage , University of Adelaide, December 29, 2003 =17th century= Illustration of a game of Calcio Fiorentino from 1688 In Wales, the game of cnapan was described at length by George Owen of Henllys, an eccentric historian of Pembrokeshire, in 1603: > \\"This game... is thought to be of great antiquity and is as followeth. The > ancient Britons being naturally a warlike nation did no doubt for the > exercise of their youth in time of peace and to avoid idleness devise games > of activity where each man might show his natural prowess and agility...... > About one or two of the clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after > a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare > saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and > feet....The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a > reasonable quantity so as a man may hold it in his hand and no more, this > ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be > boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is > called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling bolt upright into the > air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he > plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for > the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is > no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two > miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still > followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen > the chase to follow two miles and more...\\" The earliest account of a ball game that involves passing of the ball comes from Richard Carew's 1602 account of Cornish Hurling which states \\"Then must he cast the ball (named Dealing) to some one of his fellowes\\". Carew also offers the earliest description of a goal (they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\\") and of goal keepers (\\"There is assigned for their gard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers\\"). The first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): \\"I'll play a gole at camp-ball\\" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \\"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\\". In 1615 James I of England visited Wiltshire and the villagers \\"entertained his Majesty with a foot-ball match\\" Oliver Cromwell who left Cambridge University in 1617 was described by James Heath as \\"one of the chief matchmakers and players of football\\" during his time at the university. In 1623 Edmund Waller refers in one of his poems to \\"football\\" and alludes to teamwork and passing the ball: \\"They ply their feet, and still the restless ball, Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all\\".https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12322/12322-8.txt In 1650 Richard Baxer gives an interesting description of football in his book Everlasting Rest: \\"Alas, that I must stand by and see the Church, and Cause of Christ, like a Football in the midst of a crowd of Boys, tost about in contention from one to another.... and may drive it before him. ... But to be spurned about in the dirt, till they have driven it on to the goal of their private interests\\". This is noteworthy as it confirms that passing of the ball from one player to another was part of football games. The first study of football as part of early sports is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660. This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name in English and is the first to describe the following: modern goals and a pitch (\\"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals\\"), tactics (\\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\\"), scoring (\\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\\") and the way teams were selected (\\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\\"). He is the first to describe a law of football: \\"They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball\\". His account of the ball itself is also informative: \\"They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in\\". He adds: \\"The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still\\". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch. Shrove Tuesday Football in Kingston upon Thames (1865) =England= * Alnwick in Northumberland: the Scoring the Hales game survives and begins with the Duke of Northumberland dropping a ball from the battlements of Alnwick Castle. * Ashbourne in Derbyshire (known as Royal Shrovetide Football) * Atherstone Ball Game in Warwickshire. The Shrove Tuesday Ball Game is played annually along the line of an old Roman road that runs through the town known as Long Street. The game has been played for over 800 years dating back the reign of King John 1166‚Äì1216 * Corfe Castle in Dorset The Shrove Tuesday Football Ceremony of the Purbeck Marblers * Haxey in Lincolnshire (the Haxey Hood, actually played on Epiphany). In 1752 the Julian calendar was changed for the Gregorian calendar. To achieve this the days between 2 and 14 September were omitted that year. In some villages people thought it was not possible to remove 11 days from a year so refused to accept the new calendar. As a result, Christmas Day was celebrated on 5 January in those villages. The Haxey Hood is played the following day on what would have been the feast of Stephan or Boxing Day if 11 days had not been removed from the calendar. * Hurling the Silver Ball takes place at St Columb Major in Cornwall: A \\"Town against Country\\" match takes place on Shrove Tuesday and a return match is played the following Saturday. Another version of Cornish Hurling takes place at St Ives; this game used to involve men who lived at the top of town against those at the bottom end. Nowadays it is a much gentler version for children only. This version takes place on Feast Monday, normally February. * Bottle-kicking, Hallaton, Leicestershire. A game played on Easter Monday which shares common elements with medieval ball games played during celebrations marked by the Christian calendar. * Sedgefield Ball Game played in County Durham on Shrove Tuesday. * Workington in Cumbria holds three Uppies and Downies matches over the Easter period. There are no rules, except those suggested by cunning and skill, while brute force is of the greatest importance. The goals are about a mile apart. The Uppies attempt to hail the ball at the gates of Workington Hall while the Downies hail at the capstan at the harbour side. * Scarborough. Fireman vs Fisherman football match on the South Bay beach, which takes place annually on Boxing Day. The game has been played for at least 150 years, officially since 1893. =Scotland= In Scotland the Ba' game (\\"Ball Game\\") can be found at: * Duns, Berwickshire * Hobkirk, Scottish borders.

Spirals and rings of concentric circles carved on the balls can be found on standing stones and megalithic structures of the same period. Sites such as Maughanby Circle and Newgrange were designed to monitor the movements of the sun with special emphasis on the winter solstice. The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look upon today as religious. No written records exist for the Neolithic people of Britain and Ireland. From reading the archaeology it has not been possible to determine whether these peoples understood the concept of a ball game. However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including Christmastide which coincides with Yuletide, the winter solstice and the Pagan rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out. * Ancient Greece ** Episkyros * Ancient Rome ** Follis * Roman Empire ** Harpastum References External links * Category:Medieval society Category:Rugby football ","title":"Medieval football"},{"id":"2186736","text":"Zayd ibn al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb (died 632) was a companion of the Islamic prophet Mu·∏•ammad and a brother of Umar the second Caliph.

It was ported to the Commodore 64 the following year by \\"The B Team\\" (Jason Perkins, Anthony Clarke, Mark Rodgers). The BBC and Electron versions were included on the Superior Software compilation Play It Again Sam 4 in 1987 and re-issued in budget form by Alternative Software in 1989.  Gameplay  First level on the BBC micro First level on the Acorn Electron First level on the Commodore 64 Frak! is a side scrolling platform game in which the player controls a caveman named Trogg. In each level, Trogg's object is to find three keys located on the level. The platforms and ladders (replaced by logs, ropes and chains on later levels) constituting the level are laid out in a very tricky form. When Trogg steps off a platform, he does not fall straight down, but instead slides diagonally downwards. Added to the fact that long falls will kill Trogg, this calls for very skilful jumping among the platforms. Trogg exclaims \\"Frak!\\" (presumably an expletive) each time he dies. When the user manages to complete the three levels, they are returned to the first level with the screen display upside down. The game then repeats the same three stage sequence, following which it rotates 90 degrees and repeats again. Subsequent loops consist of video being displayed in black and white and rotated, and also the display being flashed on and off in three second intervals. Enemies in Frak! come in three forms: the large, hairy Scrubbly, pig-like Poglet and large-nosed Hooter (each static, as 'statues'), balloons and daggers. The statues obviously stay still, whereas the balloons fly straight upwards and the daggers fly diagonally downwards. Contact with any enemy will kill Trogg. To combat the enemies, Trogg is armed with a yo-yo that he can launch straight horizontally. The yo-yo will kill any enemy it comes into contact with. Each level also has a time-limit, which can be topped up by the occasionally found light bulbs. However, if the time runs out, the level does not end - instead, the game continues in the dark. After this point, the yo-yo can still be used to remove the static enemies from the level but will not affect balloons and daggers. Frak! encodes high scores as nonsensical secret messages, such as Hairy gonks kiss green Buddhas slowly. Ports When the original BBC Micro version was converted for the Acorn Electron, the screen mode was changed from four colours to two because of the Electron's inferior video speed. The extra RAM freed up by the smaller frame buffer made it possible to include extra levels (bringing the total to nine against the BBC's three) and a screen designer which was not in the BBC original. The C64 version was written by MicroProjects Limited (Jason Perkins, Anthony Clarke & Mark Rogers) who were subcontracted by Statesoft to do the conversion. It has six levels. The BBC version has a higher resolutio1n than the C64 and so some of the active playing is off the screen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlFFHu_NtRk Reception Acorn User remarked on the \\"outstanding\\" graphics and compared its characters to early Disney cartoons.

The son of former Green Bay Packers executive Bob Harlan, he broadcasts NFL, NBA and college basketball games on CBS and is a play-by-play announcer for the NBA on TNT. Until 2008, Harlan was the voice of Westwood One Radio's Final Four coverage. In 2010, he began serving as Westwood One's lead announcer for Monday Night Football, calling his first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLV. He has broadcast 10 consecutive Super Bowls for Westwood One, Super Bowls XLV-LIV. Ten is the most consecutively in radio, and television, network history (Jack Buck broadcast 9 straight.) Harlan also broadcast the CBS HD feed of Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. He also calls the preseason games of his hometown Packers for the team's statewide television network since 2003. In 2017 and 2019, he was voted the National Sportscaster of the Year by his peers. In all, Harlan has broadcast 11 Super Bowls and 5 Final Fours. Biography Harlan began broadcasting as a teenager for his alma mater Our Lady of Premontre High School's high school radio station, WGBP-FM, calling play-by-play for the school's boy's basketball, football and ice hockey teams. He was a ball boy with the Green Bay Packers in his teens during the time that his father, Bob Harlan, was a Packers executive in the front office. He had originally pursued attending either the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison or the University of Notre Dame in pursuit of his communications/mass media degree, but a personal recommendation from broadcaster Gary Bender to his dad Bob led Kevin to instead attend the University of Kansas and its School of Journalism and Mass Communications. Harlan was introduced to the Jayhawks' primary basketball play-by-play announcer at the time, Tom Hedrick, who audited Harlan's zeal for sports broadcasting and immediately considered him a protege in the making. Hedrick gave Harlan a sideline position his freshman year, eventually deeming him as his understudy and fill-in announcer on days where he had other commitments. Harlan graduated in 1982 with a broadcast journalism degree. In 1982, right out of college, at age 22, he became the TV and radio voice of the NBA's Kansas City Kings (now the Sacramento Kings). He then was a basketball announcer for his alma mater, the University of Kansas, for one year, then went on to call games for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs from 1985-93 after several years hosting and producing surrounding pre-game and post-game programming while still in college. Harlan also split time with the University of Missouri (1986-89) calling football and basketball games, and worked as the play-by-play voice of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for nine seasons (1989-98). On the network level, Harlan called NFL football for NBC in 1991, college football for ESPN in 1992-93, NFL for Fox from 1994-97, and joined Turner Sports in 1996 to broadcast NBA playoff games (he would begin calling games throughout the entire season in 1997, which he continues to do to this day). He began working for CBS in 1998. In addition, Harlan has called Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, and Green Bay Packers preseason games; boxing for Mike Tyson vs. Buster Mathis Jr. in 1995; basketball games during the now-defunct Goodwill Games, which were owned by Time Warner; college sports on ESPN; and several bowl games during college football seasons. Harlan has also lent his voice on the NBA 2K video game series since 2005. In 2017, Harlan was voted by his peers National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA. He again was voted National Sportscaster of the Year by the NSMA in 2019. He was also named 2019 National Sportscaster of the Year by The Athletic. In September 2019 Harlan was inducted into the Notre Dame Academy High School Hall of Fame (the former Premontre HS he attended in Green Bay, Wisconsin.)  Notable calls  Harlan has a history of injecting humor into situations during games whenever he can, in addition to being able to dramatize even mundane moments not related to the game itself. These include: May 12, 2008 ‚Äì Harlan was calling the 2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals featuring the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers, when Cavaliers superstar LeBron James drove to the basket and emphatically dunked on Celtics forward Kevin Garnett. Harlan's call of the play: > Harlan: Garnett comes out on LeBron. Now they switch and here's Pierce > again...a Smith screen. Posey will defend...OHHHHHH! LEBRON JAMES WITH NO > REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE! September 12, 2016 ‚Äì Harlan was the radio play-by-play man for Westwood One's coverage of the Monday Night Football game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams, where a fan ran onto the field. Harlan then proceeded to give a play-by-play of security chasing the man. Deadspin referred to the call as an \\"All Timer\\". > \\"Hey, somebody has run out on the field.

A card cheat will typically bend some of the important cards during the game. Below are just several of the most popular examples. In poker, for instance, a cheat may crimp one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. Another poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to crimp some of the high-value cards during the early rounds. On subsequent rounds the cheat will be able to identify some of those cards during the deal. This enables the cheat to employ a second deal and deal some of those cards to the desired hand, or simply to identify some of the cards held by other players. In any event, the cheat has a mathematical edge over the other players. In casino blackjack a crossroader may crimp all the 10-value cards. this will enable the cheat to sometimes identify the dealer's hole card (the dealer has one card face up, called the up card, and one card face down, called the hole card). In those instances the cheat(s) will know the dealer's total and play their hand(s) accordingly. Professional card counters and cheaters know that security is on the lookout for ‚Äúcheating tells‚Äù - special behaviors which casinos train security to spot.

It is a catalyst for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis in organic synthesis. This dark brown powder is commercially available. The oxide itself is not an active catalyst, but it becomes active after exposure to hydrogen whereupon it converts to platinum black, which is responsible for reactions. Preparation Adams' catalyst is prepared from chloroplatinic acid H2PtCl6 or ammonium chloroplatinate, (NH4)2PtCl6, by fusion with sodium nitrate. The first published preparation was reported by V. Voorhees and Roger Adams. The procedure involves first preparing a platinum nitrate which is then heated to expel nitrogen oxides. ::H2PtCl6 \\\\+ 6 NaNO3 ‚Üí Pt(NO3)4 \\\\+ 6 NaCl (aq) \\\\+ 2 HNO3 ::Pt(NO3)4 ‚Üí PtO2 \\\\+ 4 NO2 \\\\+ O2 The resulting brown cake is washed with water to free it from nitrates. The catalyst can either be used as is or dried and stored in a desiccator for later use. Platinum can be recovered from spent catalyst by conversion to ammonium chloroplatinate using aqua regia followed by ammonia. Uses Adams' catalyst is used for many applications. It has shown to be valuable for hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and oxidation reactions. During the reaction, platinum metal (platinum black) is formed which has been cited to be the active catalyst. Hydrogenation occurs with syn stereochemistry when used on an alkyne resulting in a cis-alkene. Some of the most important transformations include the hydrogenation of ketones to alcohols or ethers (the latter product forming in the presence of alcohols and acids) and the reduction of nitro compounds to amines. However, reductions of alkenes can be performed with Adam's catalyst in the presence of nitro groups without reducing the nitro group. When reducing nitro compounds to amines, platinum catalysts are preferred over palladium catalysts to minimize hydrogenolysis. The catalyst is also used for the hydrogenolysis of phenyl phosphate esters, a reaction that does not occur with palladium catalysts. The pH of the solvent significantly affects the reaction course, and reactions of the catalyst are often enhanced by conducting the reduction in neat acetic acid, or solutions of acetic acid in other solvents. Development Prior to the development of Adams' catalyst, organic reductions were carried out using colloidal platinum or platinum black. The colloidal catalysts were more active but posed difficulties in isolating reaction products. This led to more widespread use of platinum black. In Adams' own words: > \\"...Several of the problems I assigned my students involved catalytic > reduction. For this purpose we were using as a catalyst platinum black made > by the generally accepted best method known at the time. The students had > much trouble with the catalyst they obtained in that frequently it proved to > be inactive even though prepared by the same detailed procedure which > resulted occasionally in an active product. I therefore initiated a research > to find conditions for preparing this catalyst with uniform activity.\\" Safety Little precaution is necessary with the oxide but, after exposure to H2, the resulting platinum black can be pyrophoric. Therefore, it should not be allowed to dry and all exposure to oxygen should be minimized.

Life and career Oliver was born in Chester, the son of Charlotte Hester (Girdlestone), a religious education adviser, and Osborne George Oliver, an electricity board official. His maternal great-grandfather was William Boyd Carpenter, a Bishop of Ripon and a court chaplain to Queen Victoria. Oliver was educated at St Paul's Cathedral School, Ardingly College and at Worcester College, Oxford, where he read music under Kenneth Leighton and Robert Sherlaw Johnson. His first opera, The Duchess of Malfi (1971), was staged while he was still at Oxford. Later works include incidental music for the Royal Shakespeare Company (including The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby), a musical, Blondel (1983; with Tim Rice), and over forty operas, including Tom Jones (1975), Beauty and the Beast (1984) and Timon of Athens (1991). Oliver also wrote music for television, including several of the BBC's Shakespeare productions (Timon among those), the soundtrack to the 1986 film Lady Jane, and some chamber and instrumental music. He was a good friend of Simon Callow who commissioned the piece Ricercare No. 4 for vocal quartet Cantabile. He also composed the score for the thirteen-hour radio dramatization of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1981. The work combined a main theme with many sub-themes, all composed within the English pastoral tradition. In Tony Palmer's film Wagner (1982‚Äì83), Oliver can be seen playing the part of conductor Hans Richter and conducting in the pit of Richard Wagner's theatre at Bayreuth. He died (42) of AIDS-related complications in London. In 2006, Oliver's archive of original scores and papers was presented to the British Library by his family. Oliver was a frequent guest on BBC Radio 4's light discussion programme Stop The Week. His nephew is comedian and American TV host John Oliver.

The population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 432, increasing to 455 at the 2011 census. The village lies largely on the north side of the A6121 road from Uppingham to Stamford. It is divided into two by a small stream, the Foss, which is a tributary of the River Chater. The village has two pubs, the Boot and Shoe and the Coach House (previously the Halfway House), as well as the parish church and the village hall. South Luffenham Hall stands a short distance to the south-east of St Mary's church. There is a ruined windmill to the east of the village. Luffenham railway station was located to the north of the village and also served the neighbouring village of North Luffenham. The railway station opened in 1848 and closed in 1966. In fact, there were two railway stations in the parish, since Morcott station lay just within the South Luffenham parish boundary. History Before the Second World War, the Earls of Ancaster owned all the farms and most of the cottages, except Church Farm, which belonged to the Conants. The estate was then split up and sold off. In those early days, the village was self-sufficient, having two butchers and one baker. In addition, Bates' carrier journeyed from Barrowden each Friday to convey goods, but no passengers, to Stamford; cash would also be taken to the banks. Joe Kirby came from Barrowden each Saturday afternoon in a covered wagon selling haberdashery. The post came from Stamford by horse and cart, and subsequently by rail to Luffenham station, and whoever kept the village post office was obliged to take the letters round the village. The last blacksmith was Mr Pepper from Barrowden who visited twice weekly until 1910. To the south of the smithy, in Back Lane in a shed, was a general grocers store. In November 1904, as Edward Berridge of Ketton was delivering bread in South Luffenham, Charles Louth stole a loaf of bread to the value of 2¬Ωd, from the cart. He was sentenced to 14 days' hard labour. Out and about Village signpost Around the village are a number of old lanes little used now as they were of old. Cannonball Lane leads up to Morcott Spinney, so called because it is handed down that Cromwell's men set up his cannons in this spinney from which to fire on North Luffenham. Shocky Balke (baulk meaning a strip of grass between cultivated strips) leads southwards from the top of Pinfold Lane on to the common, where there was a pond. From this point, the track became Hangman's Lane up to the gallows, sited there, it is said, to discourage the poor who would collect their wood and feed their geese on the common. The point is marked today by some fir trees. The common originally stretched from Barrowden Lane to Foster's Bridge. The Earl of Ancaster exchanged his fields, on which the allotments and recreation field now stand, for the of common on which he built Luffenham Heath golf course which opened in 1911.Article on Golf Club in Rutland Living magazine; Nov 2010 In January 1921, fire destroyed the workshop, showroom, and caddy's hut at the Golf Club, having been started by a spark from a stove in the workshop. At Christmas 1793, a tribe of gypsies were camping at the 'Follies' near Foster's Bridge. The gypsy king, named Edward Boswell, had a beautiful daughter, Rose, the Princess. She was just 17 and dying of consumption (tuberculosis). When the time came to move on, she was too ill to travel in a jolting caravan, and so the gypsies stayed a further two months on the cold bleak heath. When she died, the churchwardens of South Luffenham would not have her buried in the parish because she was not a Christian. The curate, the Rev. Bateman, finally over-ruled his parishioners and she was buried in the south aisle. A few weeks later, a marble slab arrived from London, and was placed over her remains, subscribed by the many gypsies who converged from afar to express sympathy with their king. The slab is still faintly discernible in the church: ‚ÄúIn memory of Rose Boswell, daughter of Edward and Sarah Boswell, who died February 19th, 1794, aged 17 years. What grief can vent this loss, or praises tell, how much, how good, how beautiful she fell.‚Äù Of other road tracks, Clay Lane leads to the fields below the cemetery, and for those following the main road to Morcott, there used to be a footpath along the north side, but some years ago, the Council widened the road and absorbed the path. On the south side of this road stands a brick barn, this being built in Victorian times to serve as a dance hall for the two villages. The village green was once surrounded with white posts and chains, with a seat in the middle. The fence was put up so that the children could play within without being disturbed by wandering cattle. The posts were removed in the 1930s. In the 1920s, the Asphaltic Slag & Stone Co. Ltd set up a quarry and erected an office on the Stamford road, opposite the entrance to the recreation ground. Twenty men were employed but not from the village. The quarry business only lasted some four years as the stone was quarried out. Nothing survives as the site has been levelled. In 1919, ironstone pits were opened on the road to Pilton; there were extensive sidings to service the pits, which closed in 1968. Another quarry opened up at the north-east of the parish and was served by a rail line connecting with the main line near Foster's Bridge. In October 1920, Arthur Waterfield was killed by a fall of earth while engaged at the Luffenham Ironstone Works.Grantham Journal 23 October 1920 Tunnels Tunnels are said to run from the church to the Foss (the stream), and from the Old Hall site in Tailby's (now Bellamy's) field to the church. One villager recollects in 1912 going down the latter tunnel to rescue a terrier dog. The tunnel was some five feet high, ten feet down and built of rough stone. Having travelled five yards (5 m) in the direction of the Hall he gave up and returned because of the crumbling condition of the tunnel walls. There are various theories regarding the mounds in Tailby's field. Some recount that it is the site of the Old Hall and surrounding cottages, others think that the main mound covers an old icehouse. It is true that a few years ago a calf fell into a tunnel beneath the mound, and that afterward this was firmly covered over. At the northern corner of this field is the Adam and Eve Barn, so called because of the inset stone carving. It is thought to have been an earlier tithe barn to that which now adjoins the church. Before the Great War, the building, also known as the old Primrose Barn (after the Primrose League used by them prior to 1900) served as the village hall, and dances were held there; here would be danced the 'Lancers' and 'down the middle', all to the accompaniment of an accordion. Later the old school room, opposite the new school, was used for village meetings, until the new village hall was built in September 1922. There was also, at the turn of the 20th century, a reading room and men's club in Sapcote Cottages. The 'Old School', now a private cottage, was built in 1846 with pointed windows, to show its connection with the church. This first school was the National School, and it was not until 1875 that the new school opposite was built by the rector, Rev. James Lonsdale and presented to the village. He built it at his own expense and purchased the old school to house the head teacher. In 1900, there were 130 pupils; in 1969, when the school finally closed, there were 30. In 1972, the building was turned into a private house. The War There is no recollection of any bombs falling in the parish during the Second World War, or of aircraft crashes. War touched the community in the form of 28 child evacuees, who in 1940 arrived from London at the height of the bombing of that city. Among them was young Terry Parsons, later to become a famous singer, under the name of Matt Monro. A pinfold was formerly sited at the south end of Pinfold Lane. It was constructed with a six-foot high stone wall with iron gates, and was finally knocked down in 1910, although a part of the wall still survives today. One villager recollects a farmer walking his sheep from Ayston to Stamford Market and resting them in the pinfold overnight. The village did not have a public pond and cattle would drink from the ford on Back Lane, crossing for villagers being by footbridge. There was a pond on private land, where the last bungalow on North Luffenham Road is now sited. A bridge replaced the Back Lane ford in the 1940s. A lead village pump on the north side of The Square was removed in the 1950s. The well underneath was fed from another well at the corner of Cutting Lane and Gatehouse Lane, the Council paying ten shillings a year to the LNW Railway for a pipe to run underneath the railway. The owner of the top well then demanded ten shillings a year. When the Council refused to pay, the supply was cut off. The Council then sank themselves a well in the Hempyards to supply The Square. The Hempyards, also known as the Ropewalk, survive as mounds today, but nothing is known of the actual works, and it is assumed that they closed in the mid 19th century or earlier. The public water supply for the other half of the village came from the spring, still running today, and sited below the old grocer's shop opposite the Boot and Shoe. Cattle were taken to be washed at the wash-dyke set in the Chater, just below the stone bridge on Moor Lane (North Luffenham Road). The wash-dyke was last used in 1925. The mills The shell of the tower mill The windmill was built in 1832; in 1895, a storm blew the cap off, but the building continued to be used until 1908. The watermill is early 19th century. Owned by Molesworths, a miller was employed, who was responsible for controlling the water level of the sluice and the working of the mill. In addition, his duties covered management of the Railway Hotel. After the closure of the adjoining mill, trade at the hotel decreased and it was forced to close in the 1930s. Prior to 1910, flour had mainly been milled, and sacks were hoisted to the second floor for storage and lowered to carts below when required. When the steam-driven mill was installed in 1910, the mill concentrated on offals; this consisted of split beans, split maize, kibbled wheat (lightly rolled for chickens) and barley meal. Gleaners from the fields took their grist at harvest to the mill to make barley meal for their home-fed pig. Wheat was frailed (flailed) at home with two long poles with leather thongs, this having to take place when there was a high wind, in order that the chaff should blow away. Some gleaners frailed with a five-pronged fork. The watermill was sold in 1927. Mr Asplin, the miller, closed the sluice gate one night, forgot about it, and by morning the house and the mill were flooded. He continued milling offal until 1948, when the flume broke, the river taking a different course, and the mill was forced to close. The former mill by the railway A steam and electric mill was built by Edmund Stapleton in 1890. The mill machinery was railed direct from Thomas Robinson & Son Ltd of Rochdale via a siding from the Midland Railway. The mill opened in 1892, Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers driving the rollers, and grinding grain at the rate of 8 sacks, each of stone, per hour. Water for the boilers to make steam was pumped from the watermill. Production increased to 10 sacks per hour, then 20. Twelve men were employed from the village, and six from other villages. Men from Molesworths quarry, when short of work, came to the mill, but spent more time in the Railway Inn. In 1914, men earned 14 shillings a week and by 1919, 27 shillings a week. The furthest delivery point by horse and cart was to Somerby, but in the 1920s Foden steam engines took over, these being replaced by Yorkshire cross-boiler engines with solid tyres. By 1925, a Dennis petrol wagon was hired from Leicester. This had pneumatic tyres and speeds of were reached. Flour was then delivered as far away as Coventry and Spalding. Four tons would be carried on the wagon, and four on a trailer. In the depression, Cadge & Colman purchased the milling rights, but the mill became uneconomic and the business was transferred to Godmanchester. Luffenham remained a distribution centre until 1927. After remaining empty for some 13 years, Riull & Sons bought the premises and manufactured clips for rifle cartridges. In 1942, the Ryvita Company installed a plant for drying and washing rye for biscuit manufacture, up to 20 men being employed at the peak season. The railway siding was in use at the time, but when the station closed in 1966, this link was severed and the factory closed. Newall Engineering then took the premises mainly for reconditioning of grinding machines, some 20 men being employed. The site is now Linecross Limited. The common From the 14th century until Enclosure in 1882, owners of land held their strips, called 'known acres', each owner or occupier using the same strips each year as his own, subject to rights of grazing. An area of was divided into 1,238 pieces among 22 owners.A Short History of English Agriculture (1909) by W. H. R. Curtler When the crops had been gathered, the land became common pasture until wanted for the next cultivation. In South Luffenham, only tenants of the arable land had rights of common over the arable, whereas in Barrowden, owners of certain cottages had grazing rights. The ancient custom had been that a fixed or 'stinted' number of beasts used the fields, but of later years this was disregarded. As the fog closed in on an elderly woman toiling up the common from Tixover, shrouded against the cold night air, the sound of the church bell tolling guided her back to South Luffenham. In gratitude, and for other who might become lost, she donated a field, whose income should pay the sexton to ring the bells at 5 am and 8 pm daily from the end of October to 25 March. This continued for many years until the outbreak of the Great War. The field was originally at Foster's Bridge, but the endowment was transferred to the Bellringers Field, also known as the Feast Field and Bell Field, opposite The Coach House. Notable people *Robert Cawdrey, compiler of one of the first dictionaries of the English language, the Table Alphabeticall, became rector in 1571 but was deprived in 1587 for his puritan sympathies. *Owen Gwyn, Master of St John's College, Cambridge from 1612 and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge 1615‚Äì16, was instituted Rector 28 October 1611, remaining in office until his death in 1633. *Robert Scott, (1811‚Äì1887) the co-editor with Henry George Liddell of a Greek-English Lexicon, the standard dictionary of Ancient Greek, was rector here for four years before he was elected Master of Balliol College, Oxford in 1854. Balliol held the advowson from 1855 and many of the priests appointed were fellows of the college and noted scholars. *In 1867, promising 17-year-old poet Digby Mackworth Dolben drowned in the River Welland nearby when bathing with the son of his tutor, Rev. Constantine Estlin Prichard (1818‚Äì1869), rector of South Luffenham 1854‚Äì69 and formerly a fellow of Balliol College. *James Stephen Hodson, who was rector 1877-81, is commemorated here along with his brother William Stephen Raikes Hodson (1821‚Äì1858), a soldier prominent in the Indian Mutiny - \\"Hodson of Hodson's Horse\\". *Agnes Maude Royden, suffrage campaigner, and 'woman preacher' Inns The Coach House, formerly the Halfway House Various businesses have been conducted at the Boot and Shoe Inn, a shoemakers business in the mid 19th century, which ceased around 1900, giving the inn its name. A coal business was also carried on from the inn, and the village bakehouse was on the west corner of the building, Mr Chard being the last baker until the 1950s. Villagers brought joints of meat and batter for Yorkshire puddings here on Sundays, and these were cooked in the bake oven for twopence a time up until 1935. The chamber for the flour for bread-making was sited above the ovens to keep it warm and dry, and bags of flour from Luffenham Mills were hauled up on a wooden ladder. The Halfway House inn was so called as it was an ostler house at the midpoint for stages between Stamford and Uppingham. In 1814, the 'Lord Wellington Accommodation Coach' ran from Birmingham via Leicester and through South Luffenham at 10 am daily and connected at Stamford with the 'Lord Welling Coach' for travellers on to Norwich. The 'Leicester Coach' passed through at 3 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from Stamford. The pub was extended and renamed the Coach House in the 1990s. The former post office was once two cottages; in the part that was later the shop lived George Hippey, a platelayer. He fell foul of the landlord and one day threw paraffin under the front door, followed by a lighted match. Festivals =May Day= Children were trained to dance round the maypole, which was set up in the school playground or on the Green, this celebration ceasing in 1923. The May Queen and her attendants travelled around the village in three or four farm wagons, which were decked up with garlands, all the horses having their martingale brasses highly polished. There was then a free tea for the children in the rectory (or occasionally the Hall) grounds, and the lawns would be lit up with large Chinese lanterns. In the evening there would be dancing in the Adam and Eve barn. =Ploughboy Monday= The ploughboys would go round from door to door on Plough Monday, the second Monday in January collecting wine and cakes ‚Äì and money, if possible. The blacking of faces and dressing up by the boys, traditional in other villages, is not recollected in South Luffenham. The custom died out in the 1920s. =Wassailing Day= Wassailing was held on each 21 December until 1939. At this, the old ladies of the parish would visit the farmers and gentry to collect a shilling or a quart of tea. =South Luffenham Feast= (1st Sunday after 15 August). The Nassington or Collyweston band would arrive to start the Feast Week by marching around the village, and then playing on the Green. During the week, cricket matches against other villages were held on the recreation ground. Fenwicks from Lincolnshire arrived with their swingboats, worked by pulling ropes, and a roundabout pulled round by a piebald pony called Tommy. These, other stalls, and a rifle range shooting at clay pipes, were set up in Bellringers Field, and they stayed for the whole week. It is remembered that Vincent Second, an Italian, came from Stamford with his gaily- painted float loaded with ice cream. Great bouts of singing and dancing took place in the pubs during the week, and most men got drunk, some paralytic, on homemade wine. The railway At one time, thirteen trains a day plied between Stamford through South Luffenham and on to Seaton railway station on a double line, although one track was taken up in 1914. A small engine pushed and pulled its single carriage up and down the line. The train was affectionately known as the Wessy, the Push and the Pull, the Puff and Dart, or the Dartzi. The line from Seaton was closed and lifted in 1966. Inspired At the turn of the 20th century Jack Ingram, a well-known steeplejack, visited the village one Saturday, and was asked to grease the weathercock. He brought this down from the church steeple, and promptly refused to put it back unless he was paid a gold sovereign. This was eventually given, but not before a fight had broken out over a disagreement amongst the villages over the 'levy'. Ingram later became a \\"milestone inspector\\" (a tramp). There is a tradition in the village that sea-going boats once came up the Foss to a quay by the old village pond, and were unloaded by monks from a monastery below the church. The stream was thought to be a canal, when the sea came up to Uffington, and was quite deep until the water was backed up and silted in the race to provide power at the watermill. The Chater was said to be six feet deep at the wash-dyke. The great fires In July 1874, Samuel Hippey, a six-year-old child, playing with lucifer matches beneath a straw stack of Mr Ball, the baker, started a conflagration that spread to two cowsheds. The high wind at the time scattered burning thatch and straw in all directions and in 20 minutes George Tailby and George Pretty's farms were ablaze, as were four cottages, two occupied by William Faulks and Thomas Skillett, and a pub tenanted by George Watson. These were in Pinfold Lane; the position of the inn is unrecorded, although it is known from the 1846 Directory that the pub was the Axe and Saw with Mr Pridmore the licensee. The fire covered some , and eleven straw stacks caught fire as well. Although plenty of water was at hand, the fire had too strong a hold and all that could be done was to douse the buildings nearby to prevent a spread. Apart from a pig and a few fowls, there were no casualties, but damage amounted to ¬£1,327. Fire brigades came from Stamford, Uppingham, and Normanton, arriving too late. In April 1913, after the passing of the LNWR football special carrying excursionists to Market Harborough to cheer on Stamford (who lost), fire was noticed in Pridmore's farmyard. There was a high wind and it was assumed that a spark had come from the engine. Properties destroyed included Mr Greenfield's butcher shop, five cottages, two farms and three straw stacks; a quantity of livestock, mainly chickens, was also lost. The Stamford engine pumped water from the brook, and the manuals from Uppingham and Normanton gave assistance. Every thatched building was burnt out, although those with slates were saved from serious damage; the Durham Ox sign was burnt down. Later the Parish Council considered subscribing for the Stamford Fire Brigade, for they had turned out with their steamer although not obliged to. This was in the days before the local authorities took over the fire service.

He is commonly regarded as the third person to have accepted Islam, after Muhammad's wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid, and Muhammad's cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib. Zayd was a slave in Khadija's household for several years, but Muhammad later freed and legally adopted Zayd as his own son. Zayd was a commander in the early Muslim army and led several early military expeditions during the lifetime of Muhammad. Zayd led his final expedition in September 629 C.E, and set out to raid the Byzantine city of Bosra. However the Muslim army was intercepted by Byzantine forces and Zayd was subsequently killed at the Battle of Mu'tah. Zayd was married to prominent women of Muhammad's household, including his cousin Zaynab bint Jahsh and his loyal servant Barakah (Umm Ayman). Childhood Zayd is said to have been ten years younger than Muhammad, suggesting a birth- year of c. 581 A.D. He is also said to have been 55 (lunar) years old at his death in 629, indicating a birthdate of 576. He was born into the Udhra branch of the Kalb tribe in the Najd, central Arabia. He claimed a pedigree twelfth in descent from Udhra ibn Zayd al-Lat ibn Rufayda ibn Thawr ibn Kalb ibn Wabara.Lecker, p. 773. Zayd's mother, Suda bint Thaalaba, was from the Maan branch of the Tayy tribe. When Zayd was \\"a young boy of an age at which he could be a servant\\" he accompanied his mother on a visit to her family. While they were staying with the Maan tribe, horsemen from the Qayn tribe raided their tents and kidnapped Zayd. They took him to the market at Ukkaz and sold him as a slave for 400 dinars . Zayd's family searched for him, but without success. A lament is attributed to his father, Harithah ibn Sharahil (BaSharahil): I weep for Zayd, not knowing what became of him. Is he alive, is he to be expected, or has Death come over him? By God, I ask yet do not comprehend. Was it the plain or the mountain that brought about your end? I wish that I knew: Will you ever return? In this world only for your coming back I yearn. The sun reminds me of him when it dawns, evoking his memory as the dusk falls. When the winds blow, they stir up memories like dust. O how long my sorrow and fear for him last! Slavery in Mecca Zayd was purchased by a merchant of Mecca, Hakim ibn Hizam, who gave the boy as a present to his aunt, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid. He remained in her possession until the day she married Muhammad, when she gave the slave as a wedding present to her bridegroom. Muhammad became very attached to Zayd, to whom he referred as al- ·∏§abƒ´b (). Some years later, some members of Zayd's tribe happened to arrive in Mecca on pilgrimage. They encountered Zayd and recognised each other, and he asked them to take a message home. Carry a message from me to my people, for I am far away, that close to the House and the places of pilgrimage I stay. Let go of the grief that has deeply saddened you, and do not hasten your camels all over the earth. I live with the best of families, may God be blessed; from father to son, of Ma'ad they are the noblest. On receiving this message, Zayd's father and uncle immediately set out for Mecca. They found Muhammad at the Kaaba and promised him any ransom if he would return Zayd to them. Muhammad replied that Zayd should be allowed to choose his fate, but that if he wished to return to his family, Muhammad would release him without accepting any ransom in exchange. They called for Zayd, who easily recognised his father and uncle, but told them that he did not want to leave Muhammad, \\"for I have seen something in this man, and I am not the kind of person who would ever choose anyone in preference to him.\\" At this, Muhammad took Zayd to the steps of the Kaaba, where legal contracts were agreed and witnessed, and announced to the crowds: \\"Witness that Zayd becomes my son, with mutual rights of inheritance.\\" On seeing this, Zayd's father and uncle \\"were satisfied,\\" and they returned home without him. In accordance with the Arabic custom of adoption at the time, Zayd was thereafter known as \\"Zayd ibn Muhammad\\" and was a freedman, regarded socially and legally as Muhammad's son. Conversion to Islam At an unknown date before 610, Zayd accompanied Muhammad to Ta'if, where it was a tradition to sacrifice meat to the idols. Near Baldah on their way back to Mecca, they met Zayd ibn Amr and offered him some of the cooked meat that Zayd was carrying in their bag.Muhammad ibn Ishaq, via Yunus ibn Bukayr, cited in Guillaume, A.

I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering.\\"Bukhari 5:58:169. Bukhari 7:67:407. After this encounter, said Muhammad, \\"I never stroked an idol of theirs, nor did I sacrifice to them, until God honoured me with his apostleship.\\" When Muhammad reported in 610 that he had received a revelation from the angel Jibril (Gabriel), Zayd was one of the first converts to Islam. While Khadijah was the first Muslim of all in the Ummah of Muhammad, she was closely followed by her neighbour Lubaba bint al-Harith, her four daughters, and the first male converts, Ali, Zayd and Abu Bakr. The Hijrah In 622, Zayd joined the other Muslims in the Hijrah to Medina. Once settled in the new city, Muhammad urged each Muslim to \\"take a brother in Religion\\" so that each would have an ally in the community. Zayd was paired with Muhammad's uncle Hamza. Hamza accordingly trusted his last testament to Zayd just before his death in 625. A few months later, Muhammad and Abu Bakr sent Zayd back to Mecca to escort their families to Medina. The return party consisted of Muhammad's wife Sawda, his daughters Umm Kulthum and Fatimah, his servant Abu Rafi, Zayd's wife Baraka and their son Usama, Abu Bakr's wife Umm Rumman, his children Asma, Abdullah and Aisha, and a guide named Abdullah ibn Urayqit, and Abu Bakr's kinsman Talhah also decided to accompany them. Marriages and Children Zayd married at least six times. # Durrah (Fakhita) bint Abi Lahab, a cousin of Muhammad. They were divorced; the dates are unknown, but Durrah's two brothers were divorced from Muhammad's two daughters in 613. # Umm Ayman (Barakah), Muhammad's freedwoman and mother of Ayman ibn Ubayd. They were married \\"after Islam\\" and their son was born in 612. # Hind bint Al-Awwam, a niece of Khadijah.Muhammad ibn Sa'd. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013).

Al-Baraa died in August or September 622, so the marriage to Zayd was presumably in or after 623. # Zaynab bint Jahsh, a cousin of Muhammad. They were married in 625 and divorced in late 626. # Umm Kulthum bint Uqba, a maternal sister of Caliph Uthman. This marriage was ordered by Muhammad in 628, but it ended in divorce.\\" Zayd had three children. # Usama, son of Barakah, who had descendants, but their number \\"never exceeded twenty in any given generation.\\" # Zayd, son of Umm Kulthum, who died in infancy. # Ruqayya, daughter of Umm Kulthum, who died while under the care of Uthman. =Marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh= Around 625 Muhammad proposed that his cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh, should marry Zayd. At first she refused on the grounds that she was of the Quraysh. It has been suggested that differences between Zaynab's social status and Zayd's were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage: > The Prophet was well aware that it is a person's standing in the eyes of > Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the > people ... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their > ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that > mattered. By contrast, Montgomery Watt points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad's esteem. > She can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an > ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad, or > she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his > family to be so closely allied. When Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur'an, , Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.Ibn Hisham note 918.Al-Jalalayn, Tafsir on Q33:36-38. =Divorce from Zaynab= The marriage lasted less than two years.Ismail ibn Kathir, Al- Sira Al-Nabawiyya. Translated by Le Gassick, T. (2000). The Life of the Prophet, p. 198. Reading, U.K.: Garnet Publishing. According to the 9th- century historians Ibn Sa'd and al-Tabari, Muhammad paid a visit to Zayd's house. The hairskin curtain that served as Zayd‚Äôs front door was blown aside, accidentally revealing Zaynab dressed only in her shift. Zaynab arose to dress herself, advising Muhammad that Zayd was not at home but he was welcome to visit. However, he did not enter. He exclaimed to himself, ‚ÄúPraise be to Allah, who turns hearts around!‚Äù and then departed. When Zayd came home, Zaynab told him what had happened. Zayd went to Muhammad, saying: ‚ÄúProphet, I have heard about your visit. Perhaps you admire Zaynab, so I will divorce her.‚Äù Muhammad replied, ‚ÄúNo, fear Allah and keep your wife.‚ÄùMuhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Fishbein, M.

However, this story has been rejected by most Muslim scholarsIbn Al-‚ÄôArabi, Ahkam Al-Quran (3/1543)Sirat-Un-Nabi, by Allama Shibli Nu'ManiDr. Yasir Qadhi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbaorsGGFio mainly because of its lack of having any chain of narration and its complete absence from any authentic hadith. Some commentatorsFor example Qadi Iyad ibn Musa al-Yahsubi have found it absurd that Muhammad would suddenly become aware of Zaynab's beauty one day after having known her all her life; if her beauty had been the reason for Muhammad to marry her, he would have married her himself in the first place rather than arranging her marriage to Zayd. According to the translator Fishbein: > Zaynab, who was Muhammad's cousin, had been married by Muhammad's > arrangement to Muhammad's freed slave Zayd b. Harithah, who lived in > Muhammad's household and came to be regarded as his adoptive son - so that > he was regularly addressed as Zayd, son of Muhammad. Whether the marriage > between Zayd and Zaynab was a mesalliance from the beginning is speculation, > though the account maintains that Zayd was not reluctant to divorce his wife > and allow her to marry Muhammad. Muhammad is portrayed as reluctant to > proceed with the marriage because of scruples about whether marrying one's > adopted son's former wife violated the prohibited degrees of marriage. Arab > customary practice recognized kinship relations not based on blood ties: > fosterage (having nursed from the same woman) was one such relationship; the > question whether adoption fell into this category must have been unclear > among Muslims. The marriage did not take place until after a Qur'anic > revelation was received, giving permission for believers to marry the > divorced wives of their adopted sons. =Change of adoption laws in Islam= After these events, the traditional Arab form of adoption was no longer recognized in Islam; it was replaced by kafala. Three verses of the Qur'an were written about this. Al-Tabari states that Q33:40 was revealed because \\"the Munafiqun made this a topic of their conversation and reviled the Prophet, saying 'Muhammad prohibits [marriage] with the [former] wives of one's own sons, but he married the [former] wife of his son Zayd.'\\" Zayd reverted to being known by his original name of Zayd ibn Harithah and was no longer considered Muhammad's legal son after the revelation of Q33:5: Ibn Saad indicates that Q33:37 was a specific instruction to Muhammad and Zaynab to marry and that it explains why their marriage was necessary. Military expeditions Zayd was \\"one of the famous archers among the Prophet's Companions.\\" He fought at Uhud, Trench and Khaybar, and was present at the expedition to Hudaybiyyah. When Muhammad raided Al-Muraysi, he left Zayd behind as governor in Medina. Zayd commanded seven military expeditions. # Al-Qarada in November 624. He captured a caravan of merchandise, but most of the Meccan merchants escaped. # Al-Jumum in September 627.Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available here # Al-'Is in October 627. (free online) # At-Taraf, a raid in the Nakhl region \\"on the road to Iraq\\". # Wadi al-Qura. Zayd raided the area in November 627, but the Fazara tribe counter-attacked, killing some of the Muslims, while Zayd was carried wounded from the field. Zayd swore revenge and, after he had recovered from his injuries in January 628, he returned to Wadi al-Qura with a larger army. This time he defeated the Fazari. # Hisma, or Khushayn, against the Judham tribe in October 628. # The Battle of Mu'tah in September 629, where Zayd was killed. According to Aisha, \\"The Messenger of Allah did not ever send Zayd ibn Haritha in an army without putting him in command of it, even if he stayed after he appointed him.\\" Death in the Battle of Mu'tah and aftermath Ja\`far ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib, and  øAbdullƒÅh ibn RawƒÅ·∏•ah in Al-Mazar near Mu'tah, Jordan Zayd's grave Zayd ibn Harithah led his final expedition in September 629 C.E. A Muslim force of 3,000 men set out to raid the Byzantine city of Bosra. However, a Byzantine force of \\"100,000 Greeks joined by 100,000 men from Lakhm and Judham and Al- Qayn and Bahra' and Bali\\" intercepted them at a village called 'Mu'tah'. Zayd held the standard at the battle, until he was struck down by a spear-thrust and he bled to death. The other two leaders, Ja\`far ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib and \`Abd AllƒÅh ibn RawƒÅ·∏•ah, were also killed, and the Muslim army was routed. On hearing of Zayd's death, Muhammad went to the family. \\"The daughter of Zayd wept before the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah wept until he sobbed. Saad ibn Ubada said, 'Messenger of Allah, what is this?' He answered, 'This is the yearning of the lover for the beloved.'\\" Family tree * * indicates that the marriage order is disputed * Note that direct lineage is marked in bold.

The population of the village at the 2001 census was 99. It remained less than 100 at the 2011 census and was counted together with the civil parish of Stretton. The Thistleton area has shown evidence of Romano-British occupation including a large temple precinct and a possible small market settlement. To the north of the village there has been extensive mining for ironstone, a stone that has featured very prominently in the building of many churches and other buildings in the area for centuries. It was thought that the mining had obliterated evidence of the former greater extent of the village but much archaeology has survived showing that the original Romano-British settlement extended some at least. Extensive surveys, brought about by the planning of a haulage road to the quarry to pass through the site of the ancient township, revealed features including a well- preserved Roman road and the skeleton of a child buried well away from the cemetery. The archaeology is ongoing as the mining continues. The village contains several listed buildings including the Old Rectory and the Church of St Nicholas. Many of the village‚Äôs buildings are stone-walled and thatched. Although the church is of medieval origin only the 14th century, three-stage tower, complete with gargoyles, remains. The church has been rebuilt in the late 18th by the Brudenells, and the rector, the Rev.d John Henry Fludyer, 4th Baronet to whose family the elaborate chancel is a memorial. The newer building is fourteenth century in style however the shape of the apse is, unusually, half an octagon externally and a semi-circular shape inside. Most of the internal fittings, including the font and the organ, are relatively modern. Close by, to the south of the village, lies the RAF Cottesmore airfield established a few years before WWII. The airfield is now the Army's Kendrew Barracks. Boxing match Molineaux vs Cribb, 1811 On 28 September 1811 a massive crowd of up to 20,000 watched a prizefight at Thistleton Gap. Tom Cribb fought the American Tom Molineaux in a hotly contested re-match for the heavyweight championship of England. The match was a matter of national pride and the names of both these men were famous throughout the land. The venue was chosen as the three counties of Rutland, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire met there and if the police arrived to halt the illegal fight the boxers and crowd could escape across the county boundary. In the eleventh round Cribb knocked out Molineaux. The original match, a year before, had ended in exhaustion for both men after a gruelling 33 rounds with accusations of cheating. During the intervening period both men had lost weight; Cribb because of extensive training with the famous Captain Barclay and Molineaux due to loss of muscle whilst earning his keep at local prizefighting venues.

It is noted for St Peter's Church, with its Norman chancel arch. The population at the 2001 census was 67. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included together with the parish of Great Casterton. Geography The parish essentially stretches along the A1 (Ermine Street) from the Bloody Oaks junction to the Casterton junction. At the far north of the parish, the Warren Plantation is on the north-east side of the A1. To the north-west is Empingham. On the southern edge of Exeter Gorse, it borders Great Casterton. The boundary with Great Casterton to the B1081 junction is one field's width north-east of the A1, running parallel to the carriageways, passing the eastern edge of Tickencote Warren farm. It crosses the A1 at the B1081 junction 200 metres west of the A1 bridge where it crosses the Rutland Round, following the hedge to the west side of Ingthorpe where it meets the River Gwash and Tinwell. At Wild's Lodge it meets Empingham. It passes northwards along the eastern edge of Chapel Field Spinney again crossing the Rutland Round. It passes east of Cross Roads Farm then follows the road to Bloody Oaks. =Service station= On the northbound A1, sandwiched against the B1081 access road, is the Bloody Oaks Service Station with an OK Diner and a JET (previously a Texaco forecourt) petrol station. Bloody Oaks is at the next junction northwards. The service station allows access to the B1081 for northbound traffic. Southbound traffic on the A1 cannot be accessed. =Footpaths= The Rutland Round footpath passes west‚Äìeast through the parish, and straight through the village, following the B1081 under the A1. National Cycle Route 63NCN 63 also passes through the village, from Cross Roads Farm, then along the B1081, and onwards to Stamford. =Nature reserve= Bloody Oaks Quarry Bloody Oaks Quarry is a 1.3 hectare nature reserve and SSSI at the former quarry at OS ref SK 970108, south of Bloody Oaks on the south side of the road from Empingham to Bloody Oaks. The area is also known as Roundstone Hill, and is situated in the former quarry of Upper Lincolnshire oolitic limestone. It is thought to be the furthest north in England that chalk milkwort is found. Other species found include Horseshoe Vetch, yellow-wort, Autumn Gentian, and common thyme. There are also Pyramidal and Bee Orchids. Tickencote Marsh is a 3-hectare biological SSSI. The site in the valley of the River Gwash is a base-rich grazing marsh, a habitat which is becoming increasingly rare as a result of drainage and a decline in grazing. Common flora include lesser pond-sedge, marsh horsetail and jointed rush. History Church exterior The village is famous for St Peter's Church, Tickencote, which possesses a superb Norman chancel arch and an unusual chancel roof vault. In the arch, five orders of shafts support seven orders of moulded arches with zig zag, billet, beak heads, grotesques, crenellations and all manner of leaves, animals and motifs. The arch has sunk in the last 900 years to give a rather depressed appearance. The church was partly rebuilt in neo-Norman style by Samuel Pepys Cockerell in 1792. From 1909‚Äì12 the vicar was the Venerable Lonsdale Ragg, later the Archdeacon of Gibraltar from 1934‚Äì45. John Clare, when working as a lime burner, used to drink at the Flowerpot Inn, which is now the private house, Flower Pot Cottage (former Stonecroft). In 1903, William Le Queux wrote The Tickencote Treasure. The village was formerly the location of Tickencote Hall, built 1705 and demolished 1950. This was the seat of the Wingfield family who carried out much of the restoration of the church. Maurice Edward Wingfield CMG, son of John Wingfield, later became acting Colonial Secretary of the Colony of the Gambia, and his brother Major John Maurice Wingfield became High Sheriff of Rutland in 1911. When the Stamford Bypass was first built in October 1960, the bypass terminated with a roundabout at Tickencote, with the B1081, and the dual-carriageway continued a half-mile north near Tickencote Park. The roundabout regularly had goods vehicles overturning and shedding their load. On 11 August 1971 the section of dual carriageway north of Tickencote to The Fox at South Witham, was opened by Earl Gainsborough, Chairman of Rutland County Council, at the B1081 junction. The section was long, took two years to build by Turriff Construction, and cost ¬£2.3 million. Another historical feature of the village is a watermill that went out of use in the mid-1930s. Records show that the original mill was in use in the 4th century AD on the south side of the river, whereas the present mill is on the north side of the river and bears an inscription reading 'Tickencote Mill erected 1731 by John Wingfield'.

The population at the 2001 census was 209, increasing to 234 at the 2011 census. Village The village is just west of the A1 and within walking distance of the town of Stamford in Lincolnshire. The village has a well-used village hall, which provides a venue for parties and community events as well as regular special interest classes. Next door to the village hall is a football pitch which as well as providing a sports area is the venue for village parties. A recent major event on the field was the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 where hundreds of villagers and friends turned out for a sports day, barbeque and concert and the lighting of the jubilee beacon made at Tinwell Forge. Also nearby on Crown Lane is the village pub \\"The Crown\\" which is currently closed but has plans for refurbishment. Tinwell has a beautiful church - All Saints' Church. The church has a distinctive tower with an unusual saddleback roof; these are rare in England and was added in about 1350. Opposite the church is The Old Rectory, birthplace of Thomas Laxton (1830-1893) who conducted plant-breeding research for Charles Darwin and developed the Laxton Superb and Laxton Fortune apples and the Royal Sovereign strawberry. Other buildings of interest are Tinwell Forge and Bakery which are located on Main Street and were built in 1848. At the front of the forge is a stone surround to the village spring, which was built for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria; there is also a Victorian post box. The bakery closed in 1948 but the forge continues to be in operation. By the riverside is Tinwell Mill, although it is now a private house a mill stood at the same site during the Domesday period. Walks can be taken from Tinwell south towards Easton on the Hill, with its Norman church and the Priest's House; west around the limestone quarry and along the rivers Chater and Welland towards Ketton, Aldgate and Geeston; and east following the Jurassic Way towards Stamford, and the Macmillan and Hereward Ways to Wothorpe and Burghley House. There is a footpath map showing these routes in the churchyard. World War II On 8 July 1944, two C47s collided after taking-off from RAF Spanhoe for an exercise. One crew member managed to parachute safely but eight others and 26 Polish paratroops of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade perished in the crash. The American casualties from 315th Troop Carrier Group were taken to the Cambridge American Cemetery for burial and the Polish casualties were taken to the Polish Cemetery at Newark. All those killed are commemorated in the church.

They were first identified as a distinct receptor type through their selective activation by the agonist kainate, a drug first isolated from algae. They have been traditionally classified as a non-NMDA-type receptor, along with the AMPA receptor. KARs are less understood than AMPA and NMDA receptors, the other ionotropic glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic kainate receptors are involved in excitatory neurotransmission. Presynaptic kainate receptors have been implicated in inhibitory neurotransmission by modulating release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA through a presynaptic mechanism.  Structure  There are five types of kainate receptor subunits, GluR5 (), GluR6 (), GluR7 (), KA1 () and KA2 (), which are similar to AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and can be arranged in different ways to form a tetramer, a four subunit receptor. GluR5-7 can form homomers (ex. a receptor composed entirely of GluR5) and heteromers (ex. a receptor composed of both GluR5 and GluR6), however, KA1 and KA2 can only form functional receptors by combining with one of the GluR5-7 subunits. Since 2009 the kainate receptor subunits have been renamed to correspond with their gene name. Hence GluR5-7 are now GluK1-3 and KA1 and KA2 are GluK4 and GluK5, respectively. Each KAR subunit begins with a 400-residue extracellular N-terminal domain, which plays a key role in assembly, followed by the first segment of the neurotransmitter-binding cleft, called S1. This segment then passes through the cell membrane, forming the first of three membrane-spanning regions, M1. The M2 segment then begins on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, pushes into the cell membrane about half way, and then dips back out to the cytoplasm. This segment, termed the \\"p loop,\\" determines the calcium permeability of the receptor. M2 turns into M3, another transmembrane segment which emerges on the extracellular face to complete the neurotransmitter binding site (a portion called S2). M4 begins extracellularly, and passes again through the membrane into the cytoplasm, forming the C-terminal of the protein. Differences in the ligand binding pocket allow for the development of moderately subunit-selective kainate receptor agonists and antagonists. Conductance The ion channel formed by kainate receptors is permeable to sodium and potassium ions. The single channel conductance of kainate receptor channels is similar to that of AMPA channels, at about 20 pS. However, rise and decay times for postsynaptic potentials generated by KARs are slower than for AMPA postsynaptic potentials. Their permeability to Ca2+ is usually very slight but varies with subunits and RNA editing at the tip of the p loop. Known KAR Roles in Neurons Heteromers Many kainate receptors appear to exist as heteromers. The 'high-affinity' subunits GluK4 and GluK5 can only form functional channels as heteromers with 'low-affinity' subunits (GluK1-3). Roles Kainate receptors have both presynaptic and postsynaptic actions. They have a somewhat more limited distribution in the brain than AMPA and NMDA receptors, and their function is less well defined. The convulsant kainic acid induces seizures, in part, by activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK2 subunit and also probably via AMPA receptors Activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK1 subunit can also induce seizures but deletion of this subunit does not reduce seizure susceptibility to kainate or in other seizure models. Deletion of either GluK1 or GluK2 does not alter kindling epileptogenesis or the expression of kindled seizures. Recent investigation through voltage clamping has shown that kainate receptors have more than just an ionotropic (or directly changing a membrane's conductivity) role in neurons. The metabotropic (or indirect through secondary protein pathways) effect has been verified through many accessory proteins and sustained current through G-protein cascades. The specific link of this pathway remains to be found, as well as the explanation for why the polarization and distribution of KARs varies so much across neurons and brain regions. The proteins have been shown to pace the receptors and help explain KAR‚Äôs role in maturation of neural circuits during development. One of the larger connections and roles that kainate receptors have been shown to have is to several neurological diseases and conditions. KAR expression and distribution has shown a linkage to schizophrenia, depression, autism, Huntington‚Äôs, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy among others. Most come through mutations of GluK1-5. The causation is unclear and the subject of further investigation. Plasticity Unlike AMPA receptors, kainate receptors play only a minor role in signaling at synapses. Kainate receptors have a subtle role in synaptic plasticity, affecting the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell will fire in response to future stimulation. Activating kainate receptors in the presynaptic cell can affect the amount of neurotransmitters that are released This effect may occur quickly and last for a long time, and the effects of repetitive stimulation of KARs can be additive over time.

It regulates the removal, storage, use and disposal of human bodies, organs and tissue for a number of scheduled purposes such as research, transplantation, and education and training. It was created by the Human Tissue Act 2004 and came into being on 1 April 2005 and its statutory functions began on 1 April 2006. The Board was originally chaired by Baroness Hayman followed, in 2006, by Shirley Harrison, from January 2010 ‚Äì 2018 by Baroness Diana Warwick, from March 2018 to January 2019 by Baroness Nicola Blackwood and since November 2019 by Lynne Berry OBE. The HTA's aim is to build on the confidence people have in its regulation by ensuring that human tissue and organs are used safely and ethically, and with proper consent. It also acts as the UK competent authority under the EU Tissue and Cells Directives and the EU Organ Donation Directive. The Human Tissue Act The Human Tissue Act 2004 repeals and replaces the Human Tissue Act 1961, the Anatomy Act 1984 and the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989 as they relate to England and Wales, and the corresponding Orders in Northern Ireland. The ULTRA (UK agency) and the post of HM Inspector of Anatomy were abolished and their functions transferred to the Authority. The Act makes consent the fundamental principle underpinning the lawful storage and use of body parts, organs and tissue from the living or the deceased for specified health-related purposes and public display. It also covers the removal of such material from the deceased. It lists the purposes for which consent is required (the scheduled purposes). The Act notably prohibited private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples, such as hair and fingernails, for DNA analysis, but excluded medical and criminal investigations from the offence. Jurisdiction and compostion  The act governs England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is separate legislation in Scotland, the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 and the authority performs certain tasks on behalf of the Scottish Government (approval of living donation and licensing of establishments storing tissue for human application).

He aroused considerable controversy with his loose interdisciplinary methods and focus on broad social, environmental, and even psychological, questions in history. To him, history meant as much the revelation of sociology as of political events. Lamprecht's ambitious Deutsche Geschichte (13 vols., 1891-1908) on the whole trajectory of German history sparked a famous Methodenstreit (methodological dispute) within Germany's academic history establishment, especially Max Weber, who habitually referred to Lamprecht as a mere dilettante. Lamprecht came under criticism from scholars of legal and constitutional history like Friedrich Meinecke and Georg von Below for his lack of methodological rigor and inattention to important political trends and ideologies. As a result, Lamprecht and his students were marginalized by German academia, and interdisciplinary social history remained something of a taboo among German historians for much of the twentieth century. However, during the years of the series' publication, his work enjoyed a wide readership among the nonacademic German community. He was the chief exponent of the Kulturgeschichte (‚ÄúHistory of Culture‚Äù), and believed intensely in the superiority of German culture. Shortly before his death he repudiated, with some indignation, the conception of Germany's part in World War I as having been dictated by ‚Äúwar lords,‚Äù and avowed that in regard to it that Germany was united. Lamprecht died in Leipzig on 10 May 1915 from what appears to have been the result of internal bleeding brought on by a perforated ulcer. Influence According to Ernst Breisach, :Lamprecht himself stipulated psychological forces as the basic forces in all of history. But they derived from the collective psyche of every nation and not from the idiosyncratic forces of individual psyches. Historiography p. 279 Lamprecht found a much more positive reception for his ideas and methods in France and the United States. In 1904, he was invited to give a series of lectures at Columbia University, which were translated and published in 1905 as What is History? :Lamprecht failed to convince other historians, but a mutant of the idea of a Volksseele intruded into French historiography as the concept of a period's mentality, especially as mentalit√© or sensibilit√© in Febvre's work. Breisach p.342-3 Lamprecht's work was a formative influence in the thinking of the French social historian Marc Bloch as well the Annales School. One of his students was Cai Yuanpei, who later served as the chancellor of Beijing University and had an enormous influence on modern Chinese thought.

The bottom middle cable is missing its crimping collar.  Wire connectors  The metals are joined together via a special connector. Stripped wire (often stranded) is inserted through the correctly sized opening of the connector, and a crimper is used to tightly squeeze the opening against the wire. Depending on the type of connector used, it may be attached to a metal plate by a separate screw or bolt or it could be simply screwed on using the connector itself to make the attachment like an F connector.  Uses  Crimping is most extensively used in metalworking. Crimping is commonly used to fix bullets in their cartridge cases, for rapid but lasting electrical connections, securing lids on metal food cans, and many other applications. Because it can be a cold-working technique, crimping can also be used to form a strong bond between the workpiece and a non-metallic component. When joining segments of tubular sheet metal pipe, such as for smoke pipes for wood stoves, downspouts for rain gutters, or for installation of ventilation ducting, one end of a tube is treated with a crimping tool to make a slip joint into the next section of duct. The joint will not be liquid-tight but will be adequate for conveying low pressure fluids. Crimp joints may be arranged to prevent accumulation of dirt. In jewelry manufacture, crimp beads, or crimp tubes, are used to make secure joints in fine wire, such as used in clasps or tie loops.

Early life Allan Pineda Lindo was born in Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines. His African-American father, an airman stationed at Clark Air Base, left the family shortly after his birth; his Filipino mother, Cristina Pineda, raised him and his six younger siblings as a single mother. As a child, Pineda would make an hour-long jeepney trip to and from his school and helped his family subsist by farming sweet potatoes, corn, sugar cane, and rice. The Pearl S. Buck Foundation, an organization that finds healthier living environments for young abandoned or orphaned American children, matched him with a sponsor named Joe Ben Hudgens, a lawyer, through a dollar-a-day program. He initially came to the United States at the age of 14 for treatment for nystagmus, an involuntary movement of the eyes. After a trip to Disneyland, Pineda expressed his interest in staying in the United States. It would take another three years for Hudgens to officially adopt him, but at fourteen he moved permanently to the United States to live with Hudgens. In Los Angeles, Pineda attended John Marshall High School, where he met and befriended William Adams (stage name will.i.am), the nephew of Hudgens' roommate. Pineda's early musical influences were Stevie Wonder, The Eagles, The Beatles, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Leaders of the New School and the Filipino rock/folk group Asin. Pineda was introduced to hip hop by break dancing. \\"I would take the jeepney all the way to Angeles City, and that's how I got introduced to break dancing,\\" he said. \\"I would see kids at the corner break-dancing and I'm like, 'I wanna do that.'\\" Pineda revealed to People Magazine in 2011 that he is legally blind in both of his eyes, suffering from nystagmus and has had this condition his entire career. His vision was corrected in 2012. He has lost two of his siblings: his younger brother Arnel committed suicide (this is referenced in \\"The Apl Song\\" in the lines \\"I guess sometimes life's stresses get you down on your knees/Oh brother, wish I could have helped you out\\"). His youngest brother, Joven Pineda Deala, was murdered at the age of 22 in February 2009 in Porac, Pampanga. Musical career =1988‚Äì2000: Formations and The Black Eyed Peas= The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders will.i.am and apl.de.ap met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their trio Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation). Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker) and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, Grass Roots, was never released because Ruthless founder Eazy-E had died. The Black Eyed Peas in Paris during The E.N.D. Tour. After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Taboo, and Kim Hill became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the gangsta rap sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \\"Joints & Jam\\", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album was Bridging the Gap (2000), which included the single \\"Request + Line\\" featuring Macy Gray. =2000‚Äì03: Elephunk= In November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, Elephunk. Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo were to feature on the album. During the production of \\"Shut Up\\" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden's Crush. Dant√© Santiago then introduced Fergie to Will who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. In the United States, Elephunk reached number 14 on the Billboard Top 200 and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the UK Album Charts where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK and 8.5 million copies worldwide. The singles \\"Where Is the Love?\\" and \\"Shut Up\\" reached number 1. \\"Hey Mama\\" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for Apple and iTunes. \\"Let's Get It Started\\" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film Hot Tub Time Machine. After the success of Elephunk, the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game The Urbz. They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into Simlish and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters. The group released their breakthrough single, \\"Where Is the Love?\\", in November 2002 (featuring Justin Timberlake, although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like \\"Shut Up\\", Elephunk went on to sell 8.5 million copies worldwide. =2003‚Äì06: Monkey Business= In November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled Monkey Business, the second album with new band member Fergie. Upon the success of Monkey Business, which was released in 2005, the album was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA in the U.S. and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (or CRIA) has certified Monkey Business 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The Australian Recording Industry Association (or ARIA) has also certified Monkey Business 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 Grammy Award nominations and they also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart\\". According to IFPI, over 2 million copies have been sold in Europe. In the UK alone, it has sold over 1 million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of Elephunk, which stand at over 1.6 million copies and 10 million worldwide. The band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. =2009‚Äì2011: Continuation with The Black Eyed Peas with second hiatus and We Can Be Anything = The Black Eyed Peas performing on October 7, 2009 In early 2009, both Fergie and the group left A&M; Records for unknown reasons, both Fergie and the group are still with Interscope Records.List of former A&M; Records artists The group's fifth studio album, The E.N.D. (\\"The Energy Never Dies\\"), was released on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip hop/R&B; feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' \\"My People\\". \\"The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People ‚Äì that shit is wild,\\" will.i.am said, \\"That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does ‚Äì my three months in Australia.\\" In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The E.N.D. was the 7th best-selling album of 2009 in the U.S. It also debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom. Three additional singles, \\"Imma Be\\", \\"Alive\\", and \\"Meet Me Halfway\\", were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release. In 2009, the group became one of only artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" and \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", with the next single \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" achieving similar success, from the album The E.N.D.. These three singles topped the chart for 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \\"Imma Be\\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with \\"Rock That Body\\" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom. The Black Eyed Peas in 2011 The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on the Billboards Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. The first single of the album was \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\" and topped the charts in many countries. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's second single was \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" and was released in February 2011. The music video was filmed in Japan one week before the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The third single \\"Don't Stop the Party\\" was released in May 2011. In July 2011 the group announced that they are taking a break and have denied breakup rumors. On October 11, launched his new advocacy campaign with a song called \\"We Can Be Anything\\" for education, encouraging children in the Philippines and around the world to stay in school. He also teamed up with the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF), 57-75 Movement, and the Department of Education. Apl.d.ap and NCAF plan to build 10,000 classrooms in two years or less through the advocacy. His bandmates helped set the campaign grand launch at the Black Eyed Peas concert on October 25 at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds. On November 29, Apl.de.ap performed the campaign song with will.i.am at the Mnet Asian Music Awards held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. = 2012‚Äìpresent: Solo ventures = On May 19, 2012, apl.de.ap attended the We Can Be Anything Campaign Charity Gala Dinner at The Westbury Hotel in London. On October 13, he teamed up with Smart Communications to release a music video called \\"Jump In\\" featuring American Idol Season 11 runner-up Jessica Sanchez. In March 2013, apl.de.ap was confirmed to be one of the four coaches of the inaugural season of The Voice of the Philippines. On September 22, he premiered his new single \\"Balikbayan\\" on The Voice of the Philippines. He performed the song alongside the Top 8 contestants and Miss Universe 2010 fourth runner-up Venus Raj during the results night of the semi-finals. On September 27, he released the digital single, \\"Going Out\\". He also revealed that \\"Balikbayan\\" will be released on December. On January 31, 2015, apl.de.ap revealed his newest single and its accompanying music video, \\"Be\\", featuring Honey Cocaine and Jessica Reynoso. He also appeared as a guest mentor for will.i.am on the third series of The Voice Australia. On June 12, 2014, he confirmed his return for the second season of The Voice of the Philippines. Apl.de.ap collaborated with Filipino composer Ryan Cayabyab for his performance in the opening ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines. He and the rest of the Black Eyed Peas also performed in the closing ceremony. Other ventures =Philanthropy= Apl.de.ap was honored in America by the prestigious This Time Foundation for his charity works. On November 18, 2008, he founded the Apl Foundation to help various communities and children in the Philippines and throughout Asia. In 2011, after expressing his desire to help improve the education situation in the Philippines, his foundation formed a partnership with the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF) to create the \\"We Can Be Anything\\" advocacy campaign where Apl.de.ap and NCAF plan to build 10,000 classrooms in two years or less through the advocacy. =The Voice of The Philippines= During an interview made by The Huffington Post on 2012, he stated that he has plans on launching his own talent show in the Philippines. \\"I've been working myself up to do it because I'm not used to being on TV everyday... I've been offered a show for next year,\\" he revealed. This eventually fueled rumors that he would be joining the panel of the show after ABS-CBN acquired the rights to launch a local version of The Voice franchise later that year. On March 1, 2013, ABS-CBN has confirmed that they are in the final stages of negotiating with his management to become its fourth and last official coach of the show. On March 7, it was announced through ABS-CBN's entertainment website, Push, that Apl will sit as the fourth coach. On March 20, the network's official website stated that he was scheduled to do the initial promotional plug with TFC London and is scheduled to arrive in Manila by April to meet and work with the three other coaches and the rest of the show's team. His promotional television plug was aired on March 27 right after TV Patrol. During his introduction as the fourth coach, he was dubbed as \\"The voice that ruled the worldwide music chart.\\" In an interview conducted by ABS- CBN News, Apl admitted that it was will.i.am, Pineda's friend and co-member in The Black Eyed Peas, that encouraged him to accept the coaching stint in The Voice of the Philippines. Will.i.am is also a coach on The Voice UK. He also told the press that he will be truthful on coaching his artists, as well giving them constructive criticisms. He also wants to share his life experiences, what he has been through the music industry, and how hard it is to fulfill and reach it. He also became a judge in The Voice Teens. =BMBX Entertainment= In 2014, he opened his independent record label, BMBX Entertainment, whose name refers to 'boombox'. The label aims to sign South East Asian artists and give them a Western-style production by collaborating with musicians in Los Angeles. The label sources its talent from the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. Its current roster includes Slapshock, Kevin Lester and The Voice Philippines season 1 semi-finalist Jessica Reynoso. =Top Gear Philippines= Beginning with season 2, he will be hosting Top Gear Philippines, replacing Gary Valenciano. He will host along with Marlon Stockinger, Richard Gomez (Season 1-3), and Jolina Magdangal (Season 4 onwards). Personal life During an interview with ABC News, apl.de.ap said that he was born with a condition called nystagmus, which is characterized by an involuntary movement of the eyes that limits vision. The interview showed apl.de.ap undergoing an eye surgery by Beverly Hills eye surgeon Brian Boxer Wachler to implant artificial lenses into his eyes to correct nearsightedness and his nystagmus. Pineda is a native speaker of two Philippine languages: Tagalog and Kapampangan.

It is possible that both are informal nicknames that refer to the aircraft's unique appearance. was a prototype for a twin-engine, long-range, single-seat interceptor aircraft for the United States Army Air Forces. Although the design was conceptually advanced, it was beset by numerous problems and never approached its anticipated level of performance. The project was cancelled after the sole completed prototype was destroyed by an engine fire. Design and development =Origins= In 1940, the U.S. Army Air Corps issued Request for Proposal R-40C, requesting designs for a high-speed, long-range, high-altitude interceptor intended to destroy enemy bombers. The specifications were very bold, encouraging manufacturers to produce radical aircraft that would outperform any existing fighter in the world at the time. The aerospace parts manufacturer McDonnell Aircraft, eager to begin manufacturing its own aircraft, responded to the proposal with drawings and specifications of the proposed Model I, which would be powered by an unusual geared drivetrain with a single Allison V-3420 engine buried in the fuselage powering twin wing-mounted pusher propellers in the wings. However, 22 other manufacturers also issued proposals to meet the Army's request; the McDonnell proposal had relatively unimpressive anticipated performance, and its odd drivetrain was unproven. The Model I fell in 21st place when the 23 proposals were examined and scored. The proposals that were accepted included the similarly ill-fated XP-54, XP-55, and XP-56. Despite the apparent setback, Air Corps leaders were impressed by the nascent company's efforts, and granted McDonnell a $3,000 contract to re-engineer the aircraft.Boyne 2001, p. 146. =Final design= McDonnell engineers returned on 30 June 1940 with the Model II, which was also rejected, so it was reworked into the Model IIa, which emerged on 24 April 1941. The new design was powered by a more traditional layout, a pair of engines in wing-mounted nacelles with four-bladed propellers in a tractor configuration. However, the design was still quite ambitious; the design team tried to maintain a true airfoil section through the center fuselage, merge the rear portions of the engine nacelles with the wing, and radically fillet all edges of the fuselage and nacelles into the wings in an effort to reduce drag. The design used laminar airfoil sections throughout. McDonnell designers promised that the design would deliver a top speed of 472 mph (760 km/h) with a gross weight of 18,600 lb (8,440 kg), although the anticipated gross weight was soon increased to a somewhat more realistic 20,000 lb (9,070 kg). On 30 September 1941, the USAAFThe USAAC became the USAAF on 20 June 1941. granted McDonnell a $1,508,596 contract, plus an $86,315 fee, for two prototypes, a wind tunnel model, and associated engineering data. The Model IIa was designated as the XP-67.Boyne 2001, p. 148. The production aircraft was intended to have a pressurized cockpit, an innovation at the time. A number of armament configurations were considered including six .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon, and even a 75 mm (2.95 in) cannon before the configuration of six 37 mm (1.46 in) M4 cannon was chosen. Power would be provided by two Continental XIV-1430-1 inverted V-12 engines, fitted with turbosuperchargers, and the engine exhaust gases would augment thrust. =Testing= An extensive aerodynamic test program of the numerous advanced aspects of the design was begun by McDonnell, NACA, and the University of Detroit.Boyne 2001, p. 149. The design demanded skin that was perfectly smooth and precisely shaped to maintain its laminar- flow characteristics, mandating the development of new construction techniques, as the company had never produced an entire aircraft before. Wind tunnel testing uncovered problems with engine cooling airflow through the engine nacelles, which were never fully resolved. Difficulties were also encountered in obtaining engines, as wartime production demands hampered Continental's efforts to deliver running examples of the experimental XIV-1430 engines to competing aircraft test programs. The project was also delayed by intense competition for testing time at the NACA wind tunnel facility in Langley, Virginia. The first XP-67, 42-11677, was ready for ground trials on 1 December 1943. The aircraft was fitted with XIV-1430-17/19 engines and General Electric D-23 turbo-superchargers but no pressurization equipment or armament was installed. On 8 December, the aircraft was damaged by fires in both engine nacelles, caused by a malfunction of the exhaust manifold slip rings. By 6 January 1944, the damage was repaired and the XP-67 made its first flight, which ended after six minutes due to engine trouble. After modifications were made to the engine installations, two test flights were carried out. On the fourth flight, the engine bearings burned out when the engines were accidentally overspeeded. XP-67 in flight By this time, it was becoming obvious that the XP-67 was hampered by a serious lack of power. The engines were only delivering 1,060 hp (790 kW), well short of their promised 1,350 hp (1,007 kW) rating.Baugher, Joe. \\"McDonnell XP-67.\\" Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Military Aircraft: USAAC/USAAF/USAF Fighter and Pursuit Aircraft, Original Fighter Series-1922 to 1962, 18 September 1999. Retrieved: 27 January 2009. Company founder Jim McDonnell, frustrated by engine procurement delays and the XI-1430's subpar output, began to campaign for funding to re-engine the prototype with a pair of Allison or Rolls Royce piston engines augmented by auxiliary Westinghouse turbojets in the aft nacelles. Although McDonnell promised a very impressive 500 mph (805 km/h) top speed with the new powerplants, the Army rejected the proposal, demanding more testing of the existing design. As a result of wind tunnel tests, the tailplanes were raised 12 in (31 cm) while the XP-67 waited for replacement engines. =Trials= On 23 March 1944, flight trials restarted. U.S. Army Air Forces pilots finally got to fly the aircraft on 11 May 1944, and judged the cockpit layout fair and ground handling satisfactory, but deemed the aircraft underpowered due to its poor initial rate of climb, slow acceleration, and long takeoff roll, particularly when operating with only one engine.Boyne 2001, p. 150. Other flight characteristics were generally good during gentle maneuvers; stick forces were light, roll rate was adequate, and control was effective at all speeds with good longitudinal stability. However, a tendency to dutch roll was prevalent. The prototype also displayed several disturbing behaviors as its stall speed was approached. It began to buffet well above the actual stall speed, it felt tail-heavy in fast turns, and its nose would tuck upwards during the stall. The problems were serious enough that test pilots declined to test the XP-67's spin characteristics, fearing that a spin might be unrecoverable. This irregular and unstable stall behavior has been attributed to advanced aerodynamic principles that were not fully counteracted until the advent of electronic stability controls years later. Although the final flight test report was generally positive, the aircraft's maneuverability was deemed inferior to existing types such as the North American P-51 Mustang. Upon return to the factory, the cooling ducts were reworked. Several problems were cured during the ensuing test flights, but the engines continued to be plagued by chronic overheating and deficient power output. The XP-67 only reached a confirmed top speed of 405 mph (652 km/h), which was far short of its promised top speed of 472 mph (760 km/h), and was unremarkable compared to other fighters in service at the time. =Cancellation= Head-on view of the XP-67 On 6 September 1944, the starboard engine of the XP-67 caught fire during a test flight, and test pilot E.E. Elliot executed an emergency landing at Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri. He attempted to park the craft pointing into the wind to blow the flames away from the airframe, but the starboard main landing gear brakes failed, pivoting the XP-67 so the flames blew directly towards the aft fuselage. Elliot escaped safely, but the blaze gutted the fuselage, engine, nacelle, and starboard wing; the aircraft was a total loss.Mesko 2002, p. 5. The destruction of the lone flying prototype dealt a serious blow to the entire program because the second prototype was only 15% complete at the time. Army leaders decided to reevaluate the XP-67, ultimately deciding on 13 September that it offered no significant advantages over existing fighters already in service. The project was canceled, the remains of the first prototype scrapped, and work halted on the second prototype.The ultimate fate of the incomplete second prototype is not revealed in the consulted reference sources.

The parish includes the hamlet of Holwell. The name of the village comes from Old English and means Nunna's island. Today, the tourist attractions are the ruins of Nunney Castle, a historic church, and ducks wandering the streets near the river. The village hall is host to Nunney Acoustic Cafe which provides live music, homemade food, a bar and children's art activities on the second Sunday of each month (except July and August). On 30 September 2007, Nunney was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 report, asking whether \\"the prettiest village in England\\" is a place where we can learn \\"how to mend our broken society\\".report, excerpted from BBC Radio 4 podcast History Evidence of Roman settlement has been provided by the discovery of a hoard of Roman coins in 1869 at Westdown Farm and a villa with a mosaic floor. Nunney is mentioned as a manor belonging to William de Moyon in the Domesday Book in 1086, but the book does not mention a castle.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p. 265 The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. For many years, from the medieval period until the 19th century, Nunney was the site of water-powered mills owned initially by the Hoddinotts and then by James Fussell. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within 'Cranmore,Doulting and Nunney' electoral ward. Starting at Doulting in the west the ward stretches eastwards through Cranmore and Nunney to finish in the east at Whatley. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,374. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

The Rhaetic fissure fillings have yielded the richest assemblage of vertebrate faunas known from the British Triassic.English Nature citation sheet for the site . Retrieved 10 August 2006. Along with the rest of South West England, Nunney has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ¬∞C (34 ¬∞F) and 2 ¬∞C (36 ¬∞F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800‚Äì900 mm (31‚Äì35 in). About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west. Landmarks The market cross across the road from the church is Grade II* listed. It was originally built around 1100, when stood in the churchyard of All Saints' Church. It was removed in 1869, as the noise from children playing on the steps annoyed the rector. The stone was discovered in a builders yard and rebuilt in his garden by the squire of Whatley and the Celtic cross added. After his death and a fire which destroyed his house, the cross was again dismantled and rebuilt on its present site in 1959. There are over 30 other listed buildings in the village, including Rockfield House which was built in 1805 by John Pinch. =Religious sites= The Church of All Saints is a Grade I listed building dating from the 12th century. =Nunney Castle= Nunney Castle is a small, French-style castle surrounded by a deep moat, built for Sir John Delamare in 1373, and said to have been based on the Bastille in Paris, and shows a strong awareness of contemporary French practice. It was later the property of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, before passing to several owners and in 1577 was sold by Swithun Thorpe to John Parker who only kept it for a year before selling it to Richard Prater, at a cost of ¬£2000. During the English Civil Wars (1642‚Äì51) Colonel Richard Prater, who held the castle until 1645, lost it to Fairfax, the commander of Cromwell's forces in the battle that took place at Nunney. The castle was besieged for two days, but capitulated when Cromwell's men used cannon to blast a great hole in the north west wall of the castle. =The George at Nunney Inn= The George at Nunney Inn is close to the church and opposite Nunney Castle. It dates from the mid-18th century. Since that time it has been much extended and is now a 10 bedroom hotel with holiday cottages. The interior still features many of the original features with stone walls, exposed beams, and large open fireplaces. It is a Grade II listed building.The George at Nunney taken in 2014 =Nunney Players= The Nunney Players are a Drama group, who meet up every year to put on a performance at the village hall.

It left the main line of the Ashton Canal at Fairfield Junction immediately above lock 18. It was just over long and went through Droylsden and Waterhouses to terminate at Hollinwood Basin (Hollinwood Top Wharf). It rose through four locks at Waterhouses (19‚Äì22) and another four at Hollinwood (23‚Äì26). Immediately above lock 22 at Waterhouses was Fairbottom Junction where the Fairbottom Branch Canal started. Beyond Hollinwood Basin there was a lock free private branch, known as the Werneth Branch Canal, to Old Lane Colliery, which opened in 1797. It is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Local Nature Reserve. History The Hollinwood Branch Canal was comparatively rural in character apart from mills and factories at Droylsden. Its main purpose was to carry coal from numerous local collieries to the many mills and factories in the neighbourhood of the Ashton Canal. Passengers were also carried along its length. This canal was extensively used until about 1928 when trade began to decline rapidly due to competition from railways and roads. However, this was not the only problem as mining subsidence was becoming serious and it unofficially closed in 1932, although parts of it remained navigable. It was not until 1955 that most of it was officially closed and the short remaining section from the main line at Fairfield Junction was officially closed in 1961. Future Much of the line of the former canal remained intact, and there are now plans to re-open it as an amenity canal; these plans have the support of the local authorities. However, the problems of restoring this canal are far more challenging than those of restoring the Stockport Branch Canal. Not only is it suffering from the effects of mining subsidence but also its line has been severed twice by the Manchester ring road, which would require the construction of aqueducts to cross it. Another aqueduct would also be required to replace one across a railway that was demolished some time ago. The line up to Hollinwood Basin could not be restored because buildings now obstruct it but there are plans to connect the rest of it to the Rochdale Canal by means of a short new canal from just below the site of lock 23. Such a link was originally planned in 1792, but never constructed.Hollinwood Canal Society: History The first part of the restoration has started, with a ¬£100 Million redevelopment scheme for Droylsden including housing, flats, restaurants, shops and offices, centred on a new marina which is connected to the line of the canal, and which was opened in September 2008.Hollinwood Canal Society: Droylsden Marina News, accessed 2 March 2009 About of canal from the junction with the Ashton Canal have been refurbished, and new waterside facilities for boaters are available near lock 18. The original plans would have blocked further restoration of the canal, but were changed after representations were made by the Hollinwood Canal Society, and the canal will now pass under a building which will span the route.Hollinwood Canal Society: Droylsden News Features right The Hollinwood Branch Canal at Waterhouses is unique among Britain‚Äôs canals and it is now part of the Daisy Nook Country Park owned by the National Trust. In it included every type of canal feature, as well as some more unusual ones as well. Over this length these features were once to be found, starting and ending with road bridges over the canal: *A road bridge (Waterhouses Bridge) *A tunnel (Waterhouses, Boodle or Dark Tunnel). This was opened out in the 1920s. *A single-arched stone aqueduct over the River Medlock (Waterhouses Aqueduct) *A flight of four locks (19‚Äì22), the inner pair of which were staircase locks in that the top gates of the lower lock were also the bottom gates of the upper lock (Waterhouses Locks) *A small brick-built hut by lock 21 that is believed to have been used for the payment of wages *A canal junction where the Fairbottom Branch Canal started (Waterhouses Junction) *The towpath of the Fairbottom Branch Canal crossed the Hollinwood Branch Canal on a swivel bridge located across the head of lock 22. *An overspill weir crossed by the towpath on a low pier of stone blocks *A lock-keeper‚Äôs cottage, which doubled as an office for the collection of tolls *A pumping engine (beam engine) used to back pump water from the canal below lock 19 to the canal above lock 22 *A wooden flume over the pump house yard used to carry the water from the pump house back to the canal *A footbridge over the canal having a wrought-iron balustrade (Occupation Bridge) *A cast-iron aqueduct over Crime Lane (Crime Aqueduct) *A lake at the side of the canal that resulted from canal works at the time construction. As built, the canal severed the course of a brook and a culvert was made below the canal to accommodate this. A landslip blocked this and the waters were impounded on the offside of the canal. The new lake and canal became one and the lake was officially known as Crime Bank Reservoir but it is far better known by its later name of Crime Lake. *A road bridge (Crime Bridge) Mention must be made of a neighbour of the pumping engine known as ‚ÄòFairbottom Bobs‚Äô. This was a Newcomen steam engine (more accurately a Newcomen atmospheric engine) used to pump water from a coal mine. The water was pumped along a wooden flume for a distance of about and then discharged into the Fairbottom Branch Canal at Fenny Fields Bridge. In 1929 this engine was dismantled and taken to the United States by Henry Ford who had it completely restored. It was then placed at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. Name The name \\"Fairbottom Bobs\\" is older than the Newcomen engine. It was used to describe the pumps driven by water wheels driven by the River Medlock. The 'bobs' were L-shaped linkages designed to convert the circular motion of the wheels into an up-and- down pumping action. Early maps show the Newcomen engine as \\"Mr. Lees' Engine\\" and the Ashton Company had to negotiate with Mr. Lees (in 1798) to have the water redirected into the canal when it was built.

The music and lyrics were written by Ben Ryan (1892‚Äì1968) in 1926. It reminisces about being in a youthful quartet, singing \\"Heart of My Heart\\". History and origins The quoted line, \\"Heart of My Heart\\", so longed for in the 1926 song, begins the chorus of \\"The Story of the Rose\\", written by Andrew Mack (1863‚Äì1931) in 1899.Andrew Mack. \\"The Story of the Rose\\" 1899 (via New York Public Library) Mack was a popular American actor, singer and comedian who reportedly first sang this song in an 1899 show at the Academy of Music in New York City. The show was The Last of the Rohans, written and produced by Mack. \\"The Story of the Rose\\" is a standard among barbershop quartets the world over. It is one of the most popular songs sung on Valentine's Day, when quartets deliver Singing Valentines to oft‚Äìunsuspecting recipients going about their lives in their homes, offices, classrooms, shops, train stops, and other places. In this context, the verses are usually omitted and only the chorus (\\"Heart of My Heart\\") is sung. Other versions *A version of the popular 1926 song was recorded by The Four Aces, backed by the Jack Pleis Orchestra,Recordings by 'The Four Aces ( Jack Pleis Orch ) ' on October 14, 1953, and was issued by Decca Records. It reached #7 on Billboard. Another version recorded by Don Cornell, Alan Dale, and Johnny Desmond also charted in 1953, reaching #10 on Billboard. In the United Kingdom, a version by Max Bygraves charted at #7. *Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album Join Bing and Sing Along (1959) *Other known versions of the song include recordings by Frankie Laine and Trini Lopez (who included it on his album Trini Lopez at PJ's Vol. 2). *In 1977, Florence Henderson and Robert Reed performed the song during a medley on an episode of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour. *Ben Ryan was also the co-writer with Jimmy Durante of Durante's signature song \\"Inka Dinka Doo\\" in 1933 and was, as well, a film actor and screenwriter. Cultural references According to the book Grace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House by Sally Bedell Smith, this song was a particular favorite of U.S. President John F. Kennedy; the book mentions that the president often asked his younger brother Teddy to sing it at family gatherings. The music of \\"The Gang that Sang\\" was used for the 1954 French song \\"Plus je t'embrasse\\". The French lyrics, by Max Fran√ßois, bear no relation to the English lyrics. Jazz versions of \\"Plus je t'embrasse\\" have been recorded by Blossom Dearie and by Diana Panton. In the Get Smart episode \\"Weekend Vampire,\\" an attempt to reconstruct a tune heard just as a murder was committed led to an enthusiastic‚Äîif irrelevant‚Äîrendition of the 1926 song by Max, the Chief, and detect-o-tune operator Arrick (Roger Price).

They released seven LPs (six studio albums & one compilation) and a number of EPs before breaking up in 1998. Members have gone on with other musical projects, including the band's violinist/vocalist, Joan Wasser, as Joan as Police Woman. Kevin March also became well known in indie circles as the drummer of the band Guided by Voices, which he joined in 2002. Dave Derby Dave Derby is the leader and main songwriter of the New York City based collective of artists known as Gramercy Arms which has included collaborations from both Wasser and March. History =Founding= The Dambuilders was a band in the early 1990s Boston rock scene. The founding members - Dave Derby, Tryan George and Eric Masunaga, all from Hawaii - had played in a number of bands (such as the Exactones) before moving to Boston in 1990. The band began as the Dambuilders in Hawaii in a three-piece and four-piece configuration. Early violin was provided by Debbie Fox. With Fox's involvement, nearly all of the band's songs had electric violin tracks. Around 1992, the \\"classic line-up\\" consisted of Derby (bass guitar and lead vocals), Masunaga (guitar), Kevin March (drums) and Joan Wasser (violin). Many of the band's early recordings were engineered by Masunaga. =Commercial success= While The Dambuilders are generally considered an \\"indie\\" band, they received some commercial airplay with the single \\"Shrine\\" from the 1994 Atlantic Records release Encendedor. Although the song has no traditional chorus, The Dambuilders manage to create an appealing and memorable single using a distinctly melodic verse and an innovative instrumental section used as an intro, outro and bridge. Also contributing to the song's sound is the playing of bass chords. The song tells of a cross-cultural romantic courtship between the singer and a girl who \\"doesn't speak much English\\" but is familiar with the American music scene. In the song, the singer is willing to conform to traditional religious practices outside his own cultural sphere (\\"...if I stay with her I'll lose track of all time, so I light a candle to the shrine...\\"), but seemingly manages to stay true to his roots by redefining the acts as an aspect of his own non- religious, culturally inclusive belief system (\\"...and call it Rock n' Roll\\"). Shrine was recently ranked #17 in the MTV's 100 greatest songs of the '90s: Lollapalooza list. Their 1997 album, Against the Stars, was released by Elektra Records. In 1999 the band performed in Toronto.\\"Dambuilders: Eccentric Police & Singing Angels\\". Chart Attack, November 1995, by Chris Burland Current activities Currently, Derby and March are performing together as members of Gramercy Arms. Wasser has performed on both of their albums including a vocal duet with Lloyd Cole on the band's \\"Beautiful Disguise\\" single and video. The band, which also includes Sean Eden (Luna), Rainy Orteca (Dead Air, Joan as Police Woman, Lloyd Cole), Hilken Mancini (The Count Me Outs, Fuzzy, Colburn-Mancini), Sandy Smallens (Too Much Joy) as well as guest performances by Doug Gillard (Guided By Voices), Matthew Caws (Nada Surf), Renee LoBue (Elk City), Lloyd Cole, Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine) released its first album, called Gramercy Arms, in 2009 and is currently working on a follow up. Derby's other output includes two releases under the \\"Brilliantine\\" name, as well two solo albums (Even Further Behind and Dave Derby and the Norfolk Downs). Wasser is now performing under the name Joan as Police Woman and released her first solo E.P., Joan As Police Woman, in June 2005. She released a full-length album with the band, entitled Real Life, in June 2006, followed by To Survive in June 2008, Cover in 2009, and The Deep Field in January 2011.
