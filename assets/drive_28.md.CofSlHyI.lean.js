He is chiefly known as the founder and grandmaster of the international school of Cuong Nhu Oriental Martial Arts. Having served as a college president in South Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in 1975, he spent time in a re-education camp until escaping in a small boat. He taught entomology at the University of Florida for the remainder of his career, guiding the international Cuong Nhu martial arts community at the same time. Biography From 1961 to 1971 he was a professor in the Department of Biology of Hue University, South Vietnam, during which time he founded the Cuong Nhu style of martial arts. After the devastating 1968 Tet offensive and the communist Massacre at Hue, Grandmaster Dong organized a civil defense organization, the People's Self-Defense Forces of Hue, to help protect the public from the violence spawned by the war. His organization engaged some 25,000 people in a program of karate, games and friendly competition to rebuild morale and spirit during the Vietnam War. In 1974, Dong earned his PhD in Entomology from the University of Florida, Gainesville, and during this period (1971-74) founded and incorporated the first Cuong Nhu Karate club in the United States. He then returned to South Vietnam and served as the President of Da Nang College until the fall of Saigon and the communist victory in 1975. An outspoken opponent of communism, Dong was placed under house arrest in 1975, and spent time in a re-education camp. He and his family escaped by boat to Indonesia and eventually reached the United States in 1977. From then until his retirement he served as a professor in the Department of Entomology and Nematology at the University of Florida in Gainesville. In 1986 Dong took up long-distance running. He soon completed his first two marathons, on consecutive weekends. His first ultra-marathon was the 100-mile Western States run in Squaw Valley, California. In all, he completed 23 marathons, eight 50-mile ultra-marathons and fourteen 100-mile ultra-marathons. Upon his retirement from the University of Florida, the City of Gainesville and Alachua County, Florida, honored him by declaring August 14, 1994 as Dr. Ngo Dong Day. To commemorate his life, his family commissioned an oriental plant garden to be built and maintained in his honor at Kanapaha Nature Center in Gainesville. This garden contains plants and flowers that he liked as well as a plaque dedicated to his memory. Martial arts As a boy, Dong learned Vovinam, the Vietnamese system of martial arts, from Ngo Quoc Phong, one of the top five students of Vovinam's founder Grandmaster Nguyen Loc. Dong also learned Wing Chun from his two elder brothers, who had studied with Chinese Master Te Kong. Although their father, Ngo Khanh Thuc, was Attorney General of Vietnam, the Ngo brothers tested their fighting skills on the street by engaging hustlers and professional street fighters from the alleys and back streets of Hanoi. After moving south to Hu·∫ø in 1956 after the partition of Vietnam, Ngo Dong began Shotokan karate training under former Japanese captain Choji Suzuki. After years of training, Ngo Dong earned his fourth degree black belt in Shotokan, and a black belt in judo. Later, Dong studied with American Marine Lt. Ernest H. Cates, a judo and Goshin Jujitsu instructor who had placed first at the U.S. Olympic judo trials. He eventually synthesized his broad martial arts knowledge into his own style, Cuong Nhu, which means \\"hard-soft\\" in Vietnamese. During a special ceremony in May 1994, Grandmaster Dong was promoted to 6th degree in judo, by Sensei Ed Szrejter, then Executive Director of the U.S. Judo Association. Grandmaster Dong is the 47th judoka out of 20,000 USJA members to reach 6th dan. The Cuong Nhu Oriental Martial Arts discipline now has over 3,000 active members under the leadership of Grandmaster Quynh Ngo. Cuong Nhu has its roots in Shotokan Karate, Wing Chun, Boxing, Aikido, Judo, Vovinam and T'ai chi. Escape from Vietnam After his escape from Vietnam in 1977, Dong wrote an account of his escape in a letter to his U.S. students: See also * Mary Davis-Cates, 8th dan and highest- ranking female member of Cuong Nhu.

It covered issues such as child labor in addition to women's suffrage. After women won the right to vote, the journal's focus shifted to political education for women. One of the aims of the League of Women Voters was to demonstrate its continued political power, now in the form of large numbers of newly enfranchised voters, and to soften its image in the eyes of women who were wary of radical politics. To that end, the journal courted middle-class female readers. It editorialized in support of the Maternity and Infancy Act of 1921, which was the first major legislation to be passed after the full enfranchisement of women. Readers were urged to support the Act by writing to their representatives and talking to their neighbors about it; one article included step-by-step instructions for finding out the names and addresses of their legislators.

The line reached Westminster in 1861 and Hagerstown in 1872. In 1873 the WM built its own line from Owings Mills to Fulton Junction in Baltimore. The WM designated the Baltimore-Hagerstown line as its East Subdivision. =Connections and acquisitions= The Bachman Valley Railroad built a line from Valley Junction (1.25 mi east of Porters) south to the Maryland state line in 1872, and the Baltimore and Hanover Railroad continued the line south to Emory Grove, MD, connecting with the WM in 1879. In 1886 the WM acquired control of the line from Emory Grove to Hanover. It also took control of the Gettysburg Railroad. The Hanover Junction, Hanover and Gettysburg Railroad had extended the line from Gettysburg west to Orrtanna, Pennsylvania, in 1885, and the Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway opened the rest of the line from Orrtanna west to Highfield in 1889, where it connected with the existing East Subdivision. The Emory Grove-Gettysburg-Highfield route became the WM's Hanover Subdivision. In addition to servicing industries and cities in Pennsylvania, the Hanover Sub provided an alternate route between Baltimore and Hagerstown, although it was 23 miles (37 km) longer than the East Sub. The WM built a marine terminal at Port Covington in Baltimore in 1904, and built a new connecting line from the East Sub to the terminal. The 5.3 mile (8.5 km) line ran from Walbrook Junction, west of Fulton, to Port Covington, and was designed as the WM's Tide Subdivision. =Consolidation= In 1968 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) received government approval to jointly control the Western Maryland Railway.

Andrew Lang included it in The Yellow Fairy Book. It is also a comic book trilogy by Wally Wood. Clipper ship Wizard King Synopsis A king was lord over many lands and had mastered magical secrets. He married a princess, and they had a son. The queen set out to seek her fairy godmother, as soon as the baby was strong enough, because she had been warned that her husband was a wizard, and wizards and fairies had long feuded. Her fairy godmother gave him the gift of pleasing everyone and of learning quickly. A few years later, the queen died, instructing her son to do nothing without consulting that fairy. The king was grief-stricken. Finally, as his familiar settings continually reminded him of his queen, he set out to foreign lands, using his arts to shapeshift into animals and so move about freely. As an eagle, he saw a far country where the queen had a single daughter, astoundingly beautiful. He carried her off and pleaded with her to marry him. Although he installed her in a beautiful castle, with fine servants and a charming parrot for her pet, her capture had ensured that she would never be won over. He kept her from his court, but one day thought that she might have heard of the charms of his son. Fearing he was a rival, the king sent him on a journey. The prince traveled until he came to the kingdom where the princess had been stolen from. He was deeply moved by the story and resolved to rescue her, and went to the fairy for aid. She declared that he could not reach the enchanted castle where the princess was, and the only expedient she could think of was to capture her parrot. When the prince did this, the fairy turned the prince into an identical parrot. In his new form, the prince reached the princess and, after seeing that she disliked his father the king, told her why he was there. The fairy created a chariot, drawn by eagles, and had the captive parrot direct it to the castle. There, the prince and princess escaped on it. The king followed them to her mother's country, but when he tried to cast a magical potion on them, the fairy threw it back on him. This allowed them to capture him and so strip him of his powers. The prince asked for the king to be pardoned, and it was so. As the king took to the skies he vowed never to forgive his son or the fairy.

The second production version, the Mustang Model 2, was among the first motorcycle manufactured in the United States to have a telescopic fork. History =Origin= Howard Forrest, an engineer and former midget car racer, designed and built a water-cooled four-cylinder engine in 1936. In 1941, Forrest built a motorcycle powered by the engine, and he commuted to work at Gladden Products on the motorcycle during World War II. Company president John Gladden had Forrest and co-worker Chuck Gardner design a commuter motorcycle based on Forrest's custom bike, and started Mustang Motorcycle Corporation as a division of Gladden Products. The factory was located at the corner of S. Brand Boulevard and E. Colorado Blvd. in Glendale, California. The minibike was assisted by local engineer, Council Tucker, of Glendale, CA. Graduate of USC & Georgia Tech. He had served 4 years in the USN as an Engineer during WW2. =Villiers engined models= Prototypes built during the war used pre- war Villiers \\"Double Century\\" engines. These were no longer available at the end of the war, so the Mustang Colt, the first production version of the Mustang motorcycle, used a Villiers engine in a downsized frame with wheels. 235 Colts were made before the supply of Villiers engines began to dwindle. =Model 2 and DeliverCycle= Gladden bought the Busy Bee Company, a manufacturer of small engines, to ensure supply for later Mustang motorcycles. He then had Forrest and Gardner rework the Mustang design around a Busy Bee 320 cc side-valve single-cylinder engine. The resulting Model 2 formed the basic design for most later Mustangs, with the Busy Bee engine, a three speed Burman transmission, and wheels. The Mustang Model 2 was the first motorcycle manufactured in the United States to use telescopic forks. Production of the Model 2 began in 1947. Initial problems like noisy timing gears were remedied with special quality control measures, which included having the production foreman test and personally approve each engine that left the plant. The 1948 Model 3 DeliverCycle, a three-wheeled commercial vehicle used for parking enforcement by city police departments, was developed from the Model 2. Production of the DeliverCycle began in 1948. =Model 4 and derivatives= The Model 2 was further developed into the 1950 Model 4 \\"Standard\\" with more reliable components and with the intake and exhaust ports facing forward instead of rearward as they had faced in the Model 2. A Model 4 \\"Special\\" was derived from this, with engine performance upgrades. The DeliverCycle was similarly upgraded and became the Model 5. 1951 Mustang Pony on display at the California Automobile Museum The Model 4 Standard evolved into the Pony and the Bronco, the latter of which had the Pony's drivetrain and a standard front brake. The Model 4 Special evolved into the Stallion, with a engine, a four- speed transmission, and two-tone paint. The best-selling of these was the Pony, which became the base model of the brand. =Colt, Thoroughbred, and Trail Machine= In 1956, Mustang discontinued the slow-selling DeliverCycle and introduced a new Colt as a budget model. This second Colt model was a stripped-down version of the Pony, with an undamped leading link fork, a centrifugal clutch, and no transmission. The Colt was discontinued in 1958. Mustang introduced the Thoroughbred in 1960. Based on the Stallion, the Thoroughbred had a revised frame featuring swingarm rear suspension, a dual seat, and optional storage under the seat. The engine was uprated to and powered the Stallion's four-speed transmission. The handlebars of the Thoroughbred were welded to the forks, preventing adjustment or replacement of the bars. The Trail Machine was introduced in 1961. Unlike earlier Mustangs, it was powered by an upright Briggs & Stratton 5.75 hp engine; this was coupled to the usual 3-speed Burman motorcycle transmission and a rear tyre with a tractor tread. These components were mounted in a new, specialized frame constructed of heavy duty 7/8\\" tubular steel. Originally available only with a rigid rear end, the Trail Machine gained a version with a swingarm rear suspension in 1964. =Decline and demise= Sales began to decline in 1956. The Colt, the Thoroughbred, and the Trail Machine were developed to improve sales. By 1960, when the Thoroughbred was released, Mustang had fired Forrest and replaced him as head of design with Gardner. The DeliverCycle, which had been withdrawn in 1956 due to low sales figures, was reintroduced in 1963 and upgraded in 1964. Production of Mustang motorcycles ended in 1965. Reasons for this have been given as the unavailability of Burman gearboxes, competition from Honda, and problems within management. Racing and custom bikes Forrest built special racing engines for factory rider Walt Fulton. Fulton raced Mustangs in the Lightweight class until the AMA required racing motorcycles to have wheels with a diameter of sixteen inches or greater. Forrest built several custom motorcycles based on Mustang frames, including one powered by an Ariel Square Four engine.

It poses additional difficulties due to the Chinese characters (which frequently have different pronunciations in different contexts), the complex prosody, which is essential to convey the meaning of words, and sometimes the difficulty in obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning what the correct pronunciation is of certain phonemes. Concatenation (Ekho and KeyTip) Recordings can be concatenated in any desired combination, but the joins sound forced (as is usual for simple concatenation-based speech synthesis) and this can severely affect prosody; these synthesizers are also inflexible in terms of speed and expression. However, because these synthesizers do not rely on a corpus, there is no noticeable degradation in performance when they are given more unusual or awkward phrases. Ekho is an open source TTS which simply concatenates sampled syllables. It currently supports Cantonese, Mandarin, and experimentally Korean. Some of the Mandarin syllables have been pitched-normalised in Praat. A modified version of these is used in Gradint's \\"synthesis from partials\\". cjkware.com used to ship a product called KeyTip Putonghua Reader which worked similarly; it contained 120 Megabytes of sound recordings (GSM-compressed to 40 Megabytes in the evaluation version), comprising 10,000 multi-syllable dictionary words plus single-syllable recordings in 6 different prosodies (4 tones, neutral tone, and an extra third-tone recording for use at the end of a phrase). Lightweight synthesizers (eSpeak and Yuet) The lightweight open- source speech project eSpeak, which has its own approach to synthesis, has experimented with Mandarin and Cantonese. eSpeak was used by Google Translate from May 2010http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/05/giving-voice-to-more- languages-on.html until December 2010.http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/12/listen-to-us-now.html The commercial product \\"Yuet\\" is also lightweight (it is intended to be suitable for resource-constrained environments like embedded systems); it was written from scratch in ANSI C starting from 2013. Yuet claims a built-in NLP model that does not require a separate dictionary; the speech synthesised by the engine claims clear word boundaries and emphasis on appropriate words. Communication with its author is required to obtain a copy.http://sevenuc.com/en/tts.html Both eSpeak and Yuet can synthesis speech for Cantonese and Mandarin from the same input text, and can output the corresponding romanisation (for Cantonese, Yuet uses Yale and eSpeak uses Jyutping; both use Pinyin for Mandarin). eSpeak does not concern itself with word boundaries when these don't change the question of which syllable should be spoken. Corpus-based A \\"corpus-based\\" approach can sound very natural in most cases but can err in dealing with unusual phrases if they can't be matched with the corpus.http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/gradint/mistakes.html The synthesiser engine is typically very large (hundreds or even thousands of megabytes) due to the size of the corpus. =iFlyTek= Anhui USTC iFlyTek Co., Ltd (iFlyTek) published a W3C paper in which they adapted Speech Synthesis Markup Language to produce a mark-up language called Chinese Speech Synthesis Markup Language (CSSML) which can include additional markup to clarify the pronunciation of characters and to add some prosody information.http://www.w3.org/2005/08/SSML/Papers/iFLYTech.pdf The amount of data involved is not disclosed by iFlyTek but can be seen from the commercial products that iFlyTek have licensed their technology to; for example, Bider's SpeechPlus is a 1.3 Gigabyte download, 1.2 Gigabytes of which is used for the highly compressed data for a single Chinese voice. iFlyTek's synthesiser can also synthesise mixed Chinese and English text with the same voice (e.g. Chinese sentences containing some English words); they claim their English synthesis to be \\"average\\". The iFlyTek corpus appears to be heavily dependent on Chinese characters, and it is not possible to synthesize from pinyin alone. It is sometimes possible by means of CSSML to add pinyin to the characters to disambiguate between multiple possible pronunciations, but this does not always work. =NeoSpeech= There is an online interactive demonstration for NeoSpeech speech synthesis,http://www.neospeech.com/ which accepts Chinese characters and also pinyin if it's enclosed in their proprietary \\"VTML\\" markup.for example ; see pages 7 and 25-27 of https://ondemand.neospeech.com/vt_eng-Engine-VTML-v3.9.0-3.pdf =Mac OS= Mac OS had Chinese speech synthesizers available up to version 9. This was removed in 10.0 and reinstated in 10.7 (Lion).Voice packs are automatically downloaded as needed when selected in System Preferences, Speech Settings, Text to Speech, System Voice, Customize. Three Chinese female voices are available in the system. One each for Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. =Historical corpus-based synthesizers (no longer available)= A corpus- based approach was taken by Tsinghua University in SinoSonic, with the Harbin dialect voice data taking 800 Megabytes.

The neighborhood, Bolvanovka (–ë–æ–ª–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞), derives its name from Russian bolvan (–±–æ–ª–≤–∞–Ω), which could mean either a billet or, in obsolete sense, a non-Orthodox cult image. There have different Bolvanovka neighborhoods in medieval Moscow, a sign of wide Tatar presence (e.g. near Taganka Square). A legend says that the church stands on site of a Tatar bolvan, an artifact which symbolized submission of Moscow to Golden Horde. Ivan III of Russia destroyed this symbol (or broke ambassador symbol - basma (–±–∞—Å–º–∞), that has the same name) and established an Orthodox church at this place in 1465. His refusal to pay tribute to the Horde resulted in the Great stand on the Ugra river of 1480. A wooden church had been mentioned in city records since 1465. The new baroque building was built in the 18th century; completion date is disputed (1722 or later); what is known definitely is that the church was consecrated in 1755. Alternative accounts assert that there was a succession of wooden churches built in 1708 and 1722; extant building that replaced them was built in 1749-1755. Temporary wooden belltower was built in 1990s The church burnt down in the Fire of Moscow (1812) and was reopened to worshippers in 1815 with subsequent expansion in 1839. It was closed by Bolsheviks in 1922, partially destroyed, and returned to the worshippers in 1991. A temporary, standalone wooden belltower was added in the 1990s.

Inverailort House is a mansion, south of Lochailort, at the head of Loch Ailort. History Having been a shooting lodge for MacDonald of Clanranald, Inverailort House was enlarged in 1828 by Major General Sir Alexander Cameron. It was subsequently owned by James Head, a director of several shipping lines, who married into the Cameron family in 1890. Francis Cameron-Head died in 1957 and his widow lived at Inverailort until her death in 1994. Her companion Barbara Mackintosh continued to live at the house until her death in 2015.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11635946/Barbara-Mackintosh- chatelaine-obituary.html In the late 19th Century Christian Cameron, the wife of James Head, was a keen photographer. She took many photographs of the house and surrounding area. Most of the glass plates were lost or destroyed when the military took over the house during World War II, but the surviving photographs have been published in a book. Christian Cameron is said to have died of a broken heart after much of the contents of the house were badly damaged by the army when they emptied it. During the Second World War, Inverailort was one of a few mansions in the area used as a training base by agents of the Special Operations Executive. Here British agents were taught ruthless techniques of intelligence gathering, sabotage and survival later directly adopted by the American CIA. One of those based there was the actor David Niven. This was requisitioned by the War Office at the end of May 1940 for use in the training of irregular forces as the Special Training Centre. Initially this was operated by MI(R) but became part of Combined Operations. Many techniques of guerilla and irregular warfare were developed there and training techniques which were adopted for Commando training. SOE training was centred on nearby Arisaig House. The army moved out of the house on 20 August 1942 and it was then taken over by the Royal Navy when it became HMS Lochailort and used for the training of naval cadet ratings to be officers on small craft used by Combined Operations. The Royal Navy moved out in January 1945. The village and nearby buildings have appeared in films such as Local Hero, Breaking the Waves and Complicity. The main businesses in the area are tourism and salmon farming in the loch. As of today, Inverailort House is in a ruinous state.

Function  SYK, along with Zap-70, is a member of the Syk family of tyrosine kinases. These non- receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases share a characteristic dual SH2 domain separated by a linker domain. However, activation of SYK relies less on phosphorylation by Src family kinases than Zap-70. While Syk and Zap-70 are primarily expressed in hematopoietic tissues, there is expression of Syk in a variety of tissues. Within B and T cells, respectively, Syk and Zap-70 transmit signals from the B-Cell receptor and T-Cell receptor. Syk plays a similar role in transmitting signals from a variety of cell surface receptors including CD74, Fc Receptor, and integrins. = Function during development = Mice that lack Syk completely (Syk‚àí/‚àí, Syk-knockout) die during embryonic development around midgestation. They show severe defects in the development of the lymphatic system. Normally, the lymphatic system and the blood system are strictly separated from each other. However, in Syk deficient mice the lymphatics and the blood vessels form abnormal shunts, leading to leakage of blood into the lymphatic system. The reason for this phenotype was identified by a genetic fate mapping approach, showing that Syk is expressed in myeloid cells which orchestrate the proper separation of lymphatics and blood system during embryogenesis and beyond. Thus, Syk is an essential regulator of the lymphatic system development in mice.  Clinical significance  Abnormal function of Syk has been implicated in several instances of hematopoietic malignancies including translocations involving Itk and Tel. Constitutive Syk activity can transform B cells. Several transforming viruses contain \\"Immunoreceptor Tyrosine Activation Motifs\\" (ITAMs) which lead to activation of Syk including Epstein Barr virus, bovine leukemia virus, and mouse mammary tumor virus. =SYK inhibition= Given the central role of SYK in transmission of activating signals within B-cells, a suppression of this tyrosine kinase might aid in the treatment of B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Syk inhibition has been proposed as a therapy for both lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Syk inhibitors are in clinical development, including cerdulatinib and entospletinib. Other inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling including ibrutinib (PCI-32765) which inhibits BTK, and idelalisib (PI3K inhibitor - CAL-101 / GS-1101) showed activity in the diseases as well. The orally active SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (R788) in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. The Syk inhibitor nilvadipine has been shown to regulate amyloid-Œ≤ production and Tau phosphorylation and hence has been proposed as a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease and has entered phase III clinical trials. =Epithelial malignancies= The role of Syk in epithelial malignancies is controversial. Several authors have suggested that abnormal Syk function facilitates transformation in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head and neck cancer while other authors have suggested a tumor suppressor role in breast and gastric cancer. Without Syk, the protein it makes, and genetic disruption in a panel of 55 genes thought also to be controlled by Syk, breast ductal carcinoma in situ (breast DCIS, which can become invasive), it is believed that the cancer has a markedly increased tendency to invade and metastasize.  Interactions  Syk has been shown to interact with: * Cbl gene * CRKL, * FCGR2A, * FYN, * Grb2, * Lck, * LYN, * PTK2, * PTPN6, and * VAV1.

The site contains the oldest known cemetery within the Pacific Islands, and has been important in the gathering of information relating to the Lapita people of the ninth and tenth centuries BC. Archaeology In late 2003, 26 inhumations consisting of 36 individuals were found in the largest- known cemetery located on the south coast of √âfat√© Island in Vanuatu in the Pacific. The cemetery is thought to be between approximately 3200 and 3000 years old. A common feature of these burials is the presence of red pottery fragments bearing intricate designs. These individuals were buried in various positions. One consistent feature of the burials was the removal of the skull, following the decomposition of the periodontal ligaments. Once removed, these skulls were replaced with cone shell rings. This demonstrates a ceremonial culture. Isotopic analysis Isotope analysis was performed on the excavated individuals to determine the characteristics of human migration in the Pacific during this time period. Researchers were able to analyze isotopes from 17 of the individuals. Subsequently, they found that four individuals had different isotope levels from the remaining 13. It is believed that these four individuals were immigrants, and in addition to having different isotope levels, they may have been different culturally as well. Genetics In 2016, researchers extracted the DNA from the petrous bone of three of the individuals buried at Teouma. This is the first successful DNA extraction from ancient samples taken from the tropics. The remains date to around 3,110 to 2,710 years old. DNA analysis confirmed that all three of the individuals were female. They all belong to Haplogroup B4a1a1a, the typical 'Polynesian motif'. aDNA analysis shows that the three individuals cluster together with another Lapita sample, dating to around 2,680 to 2,340 years old, taken from Talasiu, Tongatapu, Tonga; all together, the samples form a genetically distinct population when compared against modern populations. When compared against modern populations, the ancient samples from Teouma and Talasiu are genetically closest to the Ami and Atayal people from Taiwan, and the Kankanaey people from the northern Philippines, while sharing little similarity with modern Papuans.

He bought adjacent to the Golden Clouds estate in 1946 and built his home on the edge of a cliff overlooking a private beach. The three bedroom structure was constructed from Fleming's sketch, fitted with wooden jalousie windows and a swimming pool.Ianfleming.com Description of house Fleming's visitors at Goldeneye included actors, musicians, and filmmakers.The New York Times Fleming's celebrity guests The property now operates as Goldeneye Hotel and Resort, consisting of Fleming's main house and several cottages. The estate is located in the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary, established in 2011 to protect the area's marine ecosystem. It is adjacent to James Bond Beach. History The land is on the site of a former donkey racetrack. The home was built on a cliff overlooking a private beach and was based on a sketch by the author and featured unglazed windows. In spite of its obvious proximity to Golden Clouds, Fleming claimed a number of origins for the name Goldeneye, including Carson McCullers's 1941 novel, Reflections in a Golden Eye and Operation Goldeneye, a Second World War era contingency plan Fleming had developed in case of a Nazi invasion of Gibraltar through Spain. Fleming joined The Sunday Times in 1946, for which he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. He negotiated a contract whereby he could spend three months of each year at Goldeneye. Here he entertained Ann Fleming. Ann was then married to Lord Rothermere, who thought Ann was staying with No√´l Coward.Andrew Lycett, ‚ÄòFleming , Ann Geraldine Mary [other married names Ann Geraldine Mary O'Neill, Lady O'Neill; Ann Geraldine Mary Harmsworth, Viscountess Rothermere] (1913‚Äì1981)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2014 accessed 9 Feb 2017 On 17 February 1952, Fleming began writing his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, at Goldeneye. For the next twelve years, Fleming wrote all his Bond stories there. A number of the Bond movies, including Dr. No and Live and Let Die, were filmed near the estate. In 1956 British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden and his wife Clarissa spent a month at Goldeneye after Eden's health collapsed in the wake of the Suez Crisis. The attendant publicity helped to boost Fleming's writing career. In 1976, twelve years after Ian Fleming's death, the property was sold to reggae musician Bob Marley. A year later he sold the estate to Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. Blackwell gradually added in small parcels to the original estate to reach a current total of . As it grew, he also added various cottages and huts around an inner lagoon sandwiched between James Bond Beach and Low Cay Beach. In the late 1980s, he formed the Island Outpost Company and opened the property as a small hotel. The name Goldeneye has found its way into the James Bond film and television franchises. It was used in the 1991 animated series James Bond Jr, where it became the name of a valuable pendant worn by a prince in the episode Ship of Terror.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeirq_t284 It was more famously used again in 1995, when GoldenEye became the title of the seventeenth James Bond film, the first to star Pierce Brosnan. Hotel and resort Rather than a traditional hotel, Goldeneye resort is a compound of tropical buildings, gardens and private beaches. It closed in 2007 for major additions and renovations, and reopened in December 2010. =Guests= Fleming's Goldeneye became the social epicenter of Jamaica's north coast along with nearby Firefly owned by No√´l Coward, and Bolt House, owned by Chris Blackwell's mother, Blanche, who was a long time friend of Fleming. The property was equally popular with a coterie of Hollywood stars and British literary greats as it was British aristocrats and international heads of state. Errol Flynn, Lucian Freud, Truman Capote, Patrick Leigh Fermor, the Duchess of Devonshire, Princess Margaret, and Prime Minister Anthony Eden were all visitors. The Goldeneye of the Blackwell era has also attracted celebrities, both as his friends and resort guests. Among them Grace Jones, Bono, Naomi Campbell, Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan, Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp, Kate Moss, and Richard Branson.

Motivation Microcontrollers have low immunity tolerance resulting in a very high rate of transient errors and a potential for processor failure. To improve the immunity towards electromagnetic fields, extra hardware devices are often used. Hardware protection requires additional circuitry which adds cost, weight and size to a device. Many hardware techniques focus only on the prevention or detection of failures and have no means of recovering from these errors once they occur. The software approach consists in investigating the possibilities of using defensive software techniques as protection against electromagnetic disturbances as it is an economically interesting solution. The same software mechanisms could be used for a wide range of applications and different platforms.

It was first published in English in 1989.Ricks, Kellene. \\"\`THE POWER OF MUSIC' FOUND IN NEW SONGBOOK\\", Deseret News, 20 May 1989. Retrieved on 17 March 2020. These songs are for the Primary, which is an organization in the LDS Church for children between the ages of 18 months and 12 years old, who learn about the teachings of Jesus Christ. The Children's Songbook replaced Sing with Me, which was published in 1969. The songs in the Songbook help young children learn to live righteously and keep God's commandments. The book is simplified in comparison to the LDS Hymn Book. The songs are designed to be easy for children to learn. The contents are divided so that different sections refer to various gospel topics for children. Some of the topics include prayer, reverence, gratitude, Jesus' mission, the importance of family and the home, love for God, the good feelings you can get when you live righteously, as well as a few activity songs and some songs on the beauty of nature. There is also some prelude music for playing before Sacrament meetings or in the home. Although the songs are intended primarily for children, adults in the LDS Church also utilize songs in the book for other purposes. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square has sung several of these songs from time to time in their weekly Sunday broadcast of Music and the Spoken Word. Some of the songs that appear in the Songbook also appear in the church's hymnal. Most songs that appear in either book can be sung in sacrament meeting as part of a musical program or musical number after the sacrament is delivered. There are some songs that also have been written for use in sacrament meeting that don't appear in either book, but are approved for use. One of the songs has American Sign Language (ASL) pictures that teaches how to use sign language for the words of the song. Additionally, the LDS Church's website contains ASL videos for about 45 songs from the Children's Songbook. There are 268 songs in the songbook. A few new Primary songs have been adopted by the LDS Church since Children's Songbook was published. Children in Primary sing the new songs, but a revised Songbook has not been published. Two new songs have been written in 2008 and 2009. Their lyrics reinforce the roles that fathers and mothers play, and teaches that children can also contribute to the family and grow up and become fathers and mothers.

The twin piston- engined fixed-wing aircraft was designed and built by the Glenn L. Martin Company. Design and development Glenn L. Martin, president of the company, intended that the Model 2-0-2 would be a replacement for the Douglas DC-3. It was also known as the \\"Martin Executive\\". The first flight of the model was in November 1946. Full civilian certification was gained in August 1947, several months before competing aircraft types. The total production of 2-0-2s and 2-0-2As was 47 aircraft. The aircraft was not pressurized, but was considered a long-range airliner. The fatal crash in 1948 of Northwest Airlines Flight 421 revealed a serious structural problem in the wings. Structural metal fatigue was the problem in a major wing spar. Alloy 7075-T6 was used, which is susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking and low toughness. The airliner was grounded and modifications were made. The wing components were redesigned and the engines replaced. The changed type was designated the Martin 2-0-2A. Operational history Japan Airlines Martin 2-0-2 \\"Mokusei\\" (1951) TWA Martin 2-0-2A of Southeast Airlines (Florida) at Miami in 1970 On November 13, 1945 Pennsylvania Central Airlines purchased a fleet of 35 Martin 2-0-2s from the Glenn Martin Company for $7,000,000.The Chester Times (Pennsylvania), November 13, 1945, page 3 Two weeks later, Colonial Airlines announced that they would purchase 20 airplanes for $4,000,000, scheduled for delivery in 1947.Frederick News-Post (Maryland), November 29, 1945, page 1 Early in the next year, Martin announced that Pennsylvania Central Airlines had ordered 15 more 2-0-2s, bringing the total aircraft on order in early January 1947 to 137 aircraft, with a sales value of $27,000,000.Syracuse Herald Journal, January 8, 1946, page 35 Despite the announcement of these large orders, the contract terms allowed the airlines to cancel them without any penalty. The 2-0-2 was unpressurised, unlike the competing Convair 240. Therefore, as delays in production built up, all airlines except Northwest, TWA, LAN, and LAV cancelled their orders and only 31 2-0-2s and 12 2-0-2As were actually delivered to the airlines. The first scheduled flight was on Northwest between Minneapolis and Chicago on 13 October 1947. The 2-0-2 was the first airplane subjected to the CAA's then new 'Accelerated Service Test', introduced May 15, 1947. In this test, an airliner was to undergo a rigorous 150-hour test, attempting to squeeze one year's service into a week to 10 days of flying. The 2-0-2 made such a test visiting about 50 cities in 7 days. At each city, comprehensive inspections were made of the aircraft systems to assess how wear or malfunction would occur.Big Spring Daily Herald (Texas), August 12, 1947, page 3 TWA and Northwest, initial customers of the 2-0-2, eventually sold theirs to California Central and Pioneer Airlines. Later, Allegheny Airlines acquired many of the 2-0-2s as part of the company's expansion plans, beginning June 1, 1955. Eventually, they acquired a total of 18 aircraft. Only one of this type of aircraft is known to survive, at the Aviation Hall of Fame and Museum of New Jersey. This airliner was eventually developed into the Martin 4-0-4, which was more successful.

He is best known for his opposition to poverty, social exclusion and the Mafia on Sicily, and is considered to be one of the protagonists of the non-violence movement in Italy. He became known as the \\"Gandhi of Sicily\\".Danilo Dolci, the Gandhi of Sicily, died on December 30th, aged 73, The Economist, January 8, 1998 In the 1950s and 1960s, Dolci published a series of books (notably, in their English translations, To Feed the Hungry, 1955, and Waste, 1960) that stunned the outside world with their emotional force and the detail with which he depicted the desperate conditions of the Sicilian countryside and the power of the Mafia. Dolci became a kind of cult hero in the United States and Northern Europe; he was idolised, in particular by idealistic youngsters, and support committees were formed to raise funds for his projects.Danilo Dolci, by Frank Walker, in Danilo Dolci nell'accademia del villaggio globale (a cura di Gaetano G. Perlongo), March 1998 In 1958 he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize, despite being an explicit non-Communist. He was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which in 1947 received the Nobel Peace Prize along with the British Friends Service Council, now called Quaker Peace and Social Witness, on behalf of all Quakers worldwide. Among those who publicly voiced support for his efforts were Carlo Levi, Erich Fromm, Bertrand Russell, Jean Piaget, Aldous Huxley, Jean-Paul Sartre and Ernst Bloch. In Sicily, Leonardo Sciascia advocated many of his ideas. In the United States his proto-Christian idealism was absurdly confused with Communism. He was also a recipient of the 1989 Jamnalal Bajaj International Award of the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation of India. Early years Danilo Dolci, Antimafia activist Danilo Dolci was born in the Karstic town of Se≈æana (now in Slovenia), at the time part of the Italian border region known as Julian March. His father was an agnostic Sicilian railway official, while his mother, Meli Kokelj, was a deeply Catholic local Slovene woman. The young Danilo grew up in Mussolini‚Äôs fascist state. As a teenager Dolci saw Italy enter into World War II. He worried his family by tearing down any Fascist war posters he came across.Danilo Dolci, by Jaclyn Welch, in Danilo Dolci nell'accademia del villaggio globale (a cura di Gaetano G. Perlongo), July 5, 1997 \\"I had never heard the phrase 'conscientious objector',\\" Dolci later said, \\"and I had no idea there were such persons in the world, but I felt strongly that it was wrong to kill people and I was determined never to do so.\\"Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, p. 137 He tried to escape from the authorities who suspected him of tearing down the posters, but he was caught while trying to reach Rome and ended up in jail for a short time. He refused to enlist in the army of the Republic of Sal√≤, Mussolini's puppet state after the Allied invasion in 1943. Dolci was inspired by the work of the Catholic priest Don Zeno Saltini (it) who had opened an orphanage for 3,000 abandoned children after World War II. It was housed in a former concentration camp at Fossoli near Modena in Emilia Romagna, and was called Nomadelphia (it): a place where fraternity is law. In 1950 Dolci quit his very promising architecture and engineering studies in Switzerland at the age of twenty-five, gave up his middle class standard of living and went to work with the poor and unfortunate. Dolci set up a similar commune called Ceffarello. Don Zeno was being harassed by officials who felt he was a Communist, and even the Vatican turned against Don Zeno, calling him the \\"mad priest.\\" The authorities decided to put the orphans into asylums and close down both Nomadelphia and Ceffarello. Dolci had to sit by and watch as government forces took off with many of the commune's children, and had to gather up all his energy in the building of a new Nomadelphia. By 1952, he was ready to move on and work elsewhere. In Sicily Dolci among the fishermen of Trappeto in 1952 Trappeto, 1952. Dolci in a hunger strike for eight days (October 14 to 21), in the home of Mimmo and Giustina, whose child died of hunger In 1952 Dolci decided to head for \\"the poorest place I had ever known\\" ‚Äî the squalid fishing village of Trappeto in western Sicily about 30 km west of Palermo. During a previous visit to Sicily's Greek archaeological sites he had become acutely aware of the squalid rural poverty. Towns without electricity, running water or sewers, peopled by impoverished citizens barely surviving on the edge of starvation, largely illiterate and unemployed, suspicious of the state and ignored by their Church. \\"Coming from the North, I knew I was totally ignorant,\\" Dolci wrote later. \\"Looking all around me, I saw no streets, just mud and dust... I started working with masons and peasants, who kindly, gently, taught me their trades. That way my spectacles were no longer a barrier. Every day, all day, as the handle of hoe or shovel burned the blisters deeper, I learned more than any book could teach me about this people's struggle to exist...\\" In Trappeto Dolci started an orphanage, helped by Vincenzina Mangano, the widow of a fisherman and trade unionist whom he rescued from penury and whose five children he adopted as his own. Later, he moved uphill to nearby Partinico, where he tried to organise landless peasants into co-operatives. Dolci started using hunger strikes, sit-down protests and non-violent demonstrations as methods to force the regional and national government to make improvements in the poverty stricken areas of the island. Eventually, he became known as the \\"Gandhi of Sicily\\", as a French journalist had dubbed him.Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, p. 5 Peaceful protest Arrest of Danilo Dolci in February 1956 Throughout his career in Sicily, Dolci used methods of peaceful protest, with one of his most famous hunger strike being in November 1955, when he fasted for a week in Partinico to draw attention to the misery and violence in the area and to promote the building of a dam over the Iato River, which roared down in the winter rains and dried up in the nine arid months, that could provide irrigation for the entire valley.Danilo's Dam, Time Magazine, September 21, 1962 One technique that he innovated was the \\"strike in reverse\\" (working without pay), which initiated unauthorized public works projects for the poor. This earned him his first notoriety in 1956, when he gathered some 150 unemployed men to mend a public road.Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, p. 2Dolci v. Far Niente, Time, February 20, 1956 The police called it obstruction; his helpers walked away; he lay down on the road and was arrested. Skilfully, he drummed up publicity. Famous lawyers such as Piero Calamandrei offered to defend him for free. In Defence of Daniclo Dolci , text pronounced by Piero Calamandrei before the Criminal Court of Palermo on March 30, 1956 Famous writers, such as Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, Carlo Levi, among others, protested. The Palermo court acquitted Dolci and his two dozen co-defendants of resisting and insulting the police, but sentenced them to 50 days' imprisonment (time they had already served) and a 20,000 lire (US$32) fine for \\"having invaded ground that belonged to the government.\\"'Apostle Of Poor' Set Free By Sicily, The New York Times, April 1, 1956The Sting of Conscience, Time, April 9, 1956 On his release he resumed the campaign for the dam on the Iato river and work would eventually start in February 1963.Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, pp. 18-19 Subsequently, he started a campaign for a dam in the Belice river, to avoid the valley from becoming a wasteland and providing jobs to stop the emigration of workers. Dolci proclaimed a week of mourning and with 30 associates conducted a hunger strike in the town square of Roccamena in March 1965. He then led a delegation from mayors of 19 towns in the valley to Rome to plead for the dam, parading to Parliament carrying banners protesting that \\"the Belice valley is dying\\".Sicilians March in Rome to Ask a Dam, The New York Times, March 13, 1965 In January 1968, the area was hit by an earthquake which destroyed much of the Belice valley. Dolci actively assisted victims and months after the disaster he announced demonstrations and hunger strikes to demand immediate help for homeless families living in tents.Sicilians Pledge Strikes To Seek Aid in Quake Area, The New York Times, September 16, 1968 Funds for relief and reconstruction were siphoned off by greedy administrators, and \\"Belice\\" has since become an Italian by-word for political corruption.Danilo Dolci ‚Äì The defiant social activist, by Vincenzo Salerno, Best of Sicily Magazine, April 2004 Antimafia Dolci became aware of the stranglehold of the Mafia upon the poor in Sicily. He did not attack the Mafia at first but he did come up against them at once challenging their monopoly of water supply with the project of the Iato River dam. Initially, his actions resulted in threats by the Mafia and disapproval of the authorities; later he became too well known in Italy and abroad to be dealt with without too much adverse publicity.Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, p. 164 He began his crusade against the Mafia by claiming that government officials were receiving help in their elections from Cosa Nostra. Rather than making his accusations only in Sicily, he traveled to Rome to participate before the Antimafia Commission, which was established in 1963, to ensure that his worries about the Mafia in Sicily were heard. His willingness to stand up to the Mafia in his quest to improve the living conditions of Sicilians helped him to gain the confidence of the locals. Throughout 1963 and 1964, Dolci and his assistant Franco Alasia had been gathering evidence on the links between the Mafia and politicians for the Commission. At a press conference in September 1965, they presented dozen of testimonies of people who had supposedly seen Bernardo Mattarella (father of the current President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella) and Calogero Volpe meeting with leading mafiosi. Mattarella and Volpe sued Dolci and Alasia for libel.Bess, Realism, utopia, and the mushroom cloud, pp. 194‚Äì97 Danilo Dolci e la dimensione utopica, di Livio Ghersi (accessed March 2, 2011) Tried for libel Bernardo Mattarella and his son Sergio Mattarella, the future president of Italy, in 1963 In the ensuing two-year trial, dozens of witnesses were heard and many documents were considered. When the Court refused to allow new evidence from witnesses, Dolci and Alasia decided that the trial was a travesty. They announced that under these circumstances they would no longer attempt to defend themselves.Dolci Is Boycotting Libel Trial In Italy, The New York Times, January 19, 1967 The remainder of the trial, therefore, took place with Dolci and Alasia absent from the courtroom. Dolci responded by broadcasting his opinions over a private radio station, which was promptly closed. Ragone, Le parole di Danilo Dolci , pp. 220‚Äì22 On June 21, 1967, the Court of Rome determined that Mattarella had offered reliable evidence of his opposition to the Mafia in the entire course of his political career. The statements collected by the defendants ‚Äì Dolci and his assistant Alasia ‚Äì were considered nothing more than \\"deplorable gossip, malicious rumour or even simple lies.\\" The Court was of the opinion that Mattarella \\"never had relations with the Mafia environment.\\"Decision of the Tribunal of Roma, June 21, 1967, published in ‚ÄúIl Foro italiano‚Äù 1968, 342 ff., confirmed by both the Court of Appeals of Rome (July 7, 1972) and the Court of Cassation, VI chamber (June 26, 1973). Trent'anni dall'omicidio di Piersanti Mattarella: L'\\"uomo nuovo\\" della Democrazia cristiana, asud'europa, January 25, 2010 The results of the investigation were published in 1966 in the book Chi gioca solo (The Man Who Plays Alone). Dolci made an application for an amnesty, but was sentenced to two years imprisonment for libel along with heavy fines. Alasia received a sentence of one and a half year. They never served the verdict, because of a pardon. It would have been too scandalous to send Dolci to prison and the sentence was cancelled. Mattarella had won the trial but lost a cabinet post in the new government of Aldo Moro. In appeal the sentences were confirmed in 1973. \\"To each his own responsibility before today's public opinion and tomorrow's history,\\" Dolci commented the sentence. Ragone, Le parole di Danilo Dolci , p. 41 Popular educator In the vein of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Dolci believed that conflicts in society were inevitable, but that any attempt to resolve conflicts by violence or other coercive means would eventually backfire. In the short run violent solutions might offer an advantage; in the long run, however, all positions depending on such dominative means would collapse in renewed violence.Bess, Realism, utopia, and the mushroom cloud, p. xxiii Dolci became convinced that education was the key to social progress. With the money he received for the Lenin Peace Prize in 1958, he founded the Centro studi e iniziative per la piena occupazione (Center of Research and Initiatives for Full Employment) in Partinico, the village in the Palermo hinterland that had become his home, and other towns on the island.Obituary: Danilo Dolci, The Independent, January 1, 1998 In his community work Dolci \\"sought concrete methods of pedagogy and conflict resolution that would pave the way for a fully democratic and non- violent society.\\"Bess, Realism, utopia, and the mushroom cloud, p. xxiv The centre was one of the most important examples of community development in Italy and especially in the south since World War II. It became both a form of self-organisation of local communities and a training school for a generation of socially and politically committed young people, who found their cohesion as a group and attempted to construct a process of social aggregation through the methods and instruments of active non-violence. Dolci used the Socratic method, a dialectic method of inquiry, and \\"popular self-analysis\\" for empowerment of communities. His pedagogical methods emphasized social awareness and cultural interaction, and won him a worldwide standing. His ideas were taken up by a small but passionate group of supporters that took his methods across Sicily and into mainland Italy. Controversy Dolci‚Äôs life and actions stirred ample controversy. He annoyed the authorities, who often actively worked against him. Some of the locals that opposed the Iato river dam were not pleased to see the valleys flooded, and gardens and olive trees ruined. The contractors of the works eventually were either in the Mafia or their middlemen. Dolci was often short of, and careless with, money. He was helped out from time to time, predominantly by English families whose fortunes had been made with the sweet Marsala wine manufactured in Sicily. In 1964, Palermo archbishop Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini publicly denounced Dolci and Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, author of The Leopard, as well as the Mafia, for \\"defaming\\" all Sicilians. Ruffini‚Äôs allegations and their approval by Pope Paul VIPope Joins Cardinal In Defense Of Sicily, The New York Times, April 26, 1964 could be interpreted as a kind of endorsement for his liquidation and increased concerns for Dolci‚Äôs safety.Mangione, A Passion for Sicilians, p. 18 In 1968 Dolci was accused of embezzling funds sent from abroad to help the victims of the earthquake which destroyed much of the Belice valley, though the charges were never substantiated.Danilo Dolci, Vivid Voice Of Sicily's Poor, Dies at 73, The New York Times, December 31, 1997 At the same time, some of his followers left to set up their own educational centres accusing him of excessive authoritarianism. Some of Dolci's later initiatives were less successful than others, often bordering on the intangible. His centre sought to produce evidence against a secret NATO submarine base around Maddalena island off Sardinia on the basis that such an installation required Italian approval and control which in this case was apparently granted covertly to the United States Navy. The smears succeeded in pushing Dolci out of the spotlight in Italy. The last 20 years of his life he disappeared from public view, although he continued to be revered abroad, winning prizes for his poetry, and working as a guest lecturer at universities. Death and legacy Danilo Dolci (left) and Giuseppe Impastato (right), the Antimafia activist who was killed in 1978 Dolci has been proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize, denounced by the Cardinal Archbishop of Palermo; he has won the support of many Communists and some Jesuits, been threatened by the Mafia, and been prosecuted for obscenity by the Italian government for his book Inchiesta a Palermo (Report from Palermo).From the Slums, Time, January 13, 1958 Dolci was a great writer. His books are remarkable accounts of the society he surveys, and their accuracy and insight have helped to give a realistic basis to any schemes for improvement. Above all he has given a voice to the abandoned, forgotten, despairing, nameless, suffering people of Sicily. Unforgettably he enabled peasants and fishermen, mothers and prostitutes, street urchins, outlaws and bandits, police and mafiosi to tell their stories. He refused to answer to anybody and never joined a political party despite several invitations from the Italian Communist Party to run for office. \\"Reality is very complex,\\" he said. \\"To understand it, men have tried Christianity, liberalism, Gandhism, socialism. There is some truth in all solutions. We are all mendicants of truth.\\" In the 1970s he rebelled against the state monopoly on broadcasting and set up his own radio station in Partinico in the face of stiff resistance from the police. Dolci died on December 30, 1997 in Trappeto, from heart failure. He was survived by the five adopted children he had with his first wife, Vincenzina, and by two children from his second marriage. His death has triggered a curious mixture of reactions. While the chief Antimafia prosecutor in Palermo, Gian Carlo Caselli, said Dolci was one of the people who gave him the keys to do his job, the national press gave him surprisingly short shrift, describing him as a historical curiosity whose work has long since been forgotten. According to the obituary in The Independent: \\"If the world now knows anything about the dark, secretive world of the Sicilian Mafia in the first turbulent years after the Second World War, it is largely thanks to Danilo Dolci.\\" The man who in his youth studied architecture became an architect of social change. For long, he was practically unknown in his native Slovenia. In 2007, however, an exhibition on his life and work was organized in his native town of Se≈æana. In 2010, a book of his poetry was first translated into Slovene. The same year, a bilingual memorial plaque was placed on his native house, and a local educational organization was named after him.

All songs are credited to the band as a whole (except for three tracks co-credited to the just-departed Arnaldo Antunes), as it happened in the previous album, Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora. Also, it marks the first time Jack Endino worked with them, the only foreign one they ever worked with. A section of \\"Disneyl√¢ndia\\" was used as part of a question of the 2013 ENEM de 2013, specifically \\"Pilhas americanas alimentam eletrodom√©sticos ingleses na Nova Guin√© / Gasolina √°rabe alimenta autom√≥veis americanos na √Åfrica do Sul. / (...) / Crian√ßas iraquianas fugidas da guerra / N√£o obt√©m visto no consulado americano do Egito / Para entrarem na Disneyl√¢ndia\\" (American batteries feed English home appliances in New Guinea / Arab gas feeds American cars in South Africa / (...) / War-fleeing Iraqi children / Do not obtain visa at the American consulate in Egypt / To enter Disneyland\\") for the examinees to analyze consuming and production relations in the world.

Until December 1994, it had sold 125,000 copies in Brazil and 3,500 in Argentina.  Background and production  The album was conceived in times when part of the Brazilian press considered rock from that country - as it was done in the 80s - to be over. The initiative to have the album produced by Jack Endino came from the band itself, more precisely from drummer Charles Gavin. Through their label WEA, they sent him their √ï Bl√©sq Blom album. Endino was initially confused as to why a band with such a sound was willing to have him produce their album, but once the band sent him newer songs, he became interested. : He also listened to Cabe√ßa Dinossauro and Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora before starting his works. By the time of the album release, he claimed to find it \\"very interesting that they were willing to do the reverse of what was normally done - which is to go from more radical rock to pop\\". About Antunes absence, Endino commented that the mood among the band wasn't tense and that the group, still a seven-piece band, was not upset about the member's exit, although they still showed much care for him. The first title considered for the album was A Volta dos Mortos-Vivos (\\"The Return of the Living Dead\\"), but the band couldn't afford the rights for this name, which was already used for a 1985 film.

James was the 3rd son of Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, and Isabella of Urgell. At the age of just 14, he took part in the battle of Alfarrobeira (1449) where his father's army was defeated by the Portuguese royal army. James was taken captive after the battle, but he escaped and, together with his brother John and his sister Beatrice, took refuge in Burgundy, under the protection of his aunt, Isabella of Portugal (the consort of Duke Philip III the Good). James of Portugal studied in Flanders and, on March 23, 1453, was appointed Bishop of Arras. On his aunt‚Äôs advice, he traveled to Rome, where Pope Nicholas V, hearing of the disgraces inflicted upon his family after Alfarrobeira, resolved to appoint the young James as the new Archbishop of Lisbon, which had been recently vacated by the death of D. Lu√≠s Coutinho. However, not being old enough to be consecrated to the dignity, James was only appointed administrator in perpetuity of the Archdiocese on April 30, 1453. Given the political situation in Portugal, James was unable to return to Lisbon to take possession of it, and so remained in Italy and governed his archdiocese from afar, via the vicar-general Lu√≠s Anes. Nicholas V having died in early 1455, the new Pope Calixtus III elevated James to a cardinal-deacon of the Church (despite not having the requisite 30 years of age for the office), assigning him the titular diaconate of Santa Maria in Portico Octaviae, soon substituted for the diaconate of Sant'Eustachio. Callixtus III also gave James the Bishopric of Paphos, in Cyprus, where his brother, John, had married Charlotte of Lusignan, Princess of Cyprus. Following the death of Callixtus III, James of Portugal participated in the conclave that elected Pius II as the new pope. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, number 58, at the 9th Chapter of the order, held in 1456 at The Hague. His tomb made by Antonio del Rossellino While travelling from Rome to Mantua, James of Portugal fell ill and died in Florence on August 15, 1459, at the age of twenty-six. He was buried in the basilica of San Miniato al Monte in Florence, the only tomb in that church. Some of the best artists in Renaissance Florence were commissioned to design and decorate the chapel of the \\"Cardinale del Portogallo\\" in San Miniato. Portuguese art historian Ant√≥nio B√©lard da Fonseca, in his multi-volume O Mist√©rio dos Pain√©is (1957-1967), controversially claimed that it is James of Portugal, and not St. Vincent, who is depicted as the radiant saintly figure in the central panels of the famous Saint Vincent Panels of Nuno Gon√ßalves.

Composition and process Enterococcus colonies (black) growing on BEA Bile salts are the selective ingredient, while esculin is the differential component. Enterococcus hydrolyze esculin to products that react with ferric citrate in the medium to produce insoluble iron salts, resulting in the blackening of the medium. Test results must be interpreted in conjunction with gram stain morphology. Uses Bile Esculin Agar is used primarily to differentiate Enterococcus from Streptococcus. Members of the genus Enterococcus are capable of growing in the presence of 40% bile (oxgall) and hydrolyzing esculin to glucose and esculetin. Esculetin combines with ferric ions to produce a black complex. For some purposes, certain bacteria are able to hydrolyze aesculin. A plate containing aesculin will fluoresce a pale blue under UV radiation. Some bacteria can hydrolise this, leading to UV dark colonies, as opposed to UV light ones. When new techniques are produced to identify enterococci, they are often compared to the use of bile esculin agar.

Cambuslang was one of the founding members of the Scottish Football League, but left the league after just two seasons. History The club was founded in 1874. The new football club was named Excelsior with a pitch being laid out in Cambuslang Public Park, known locally as Bogshole Park. The new club were challenged by the lads from the village of Halfway to play for the right to call themselves Cambuslang, so the Excelsior team went to Halfway and in their first match at Clyde Street Park won by the scoreline of 6‚Äì0; from then on the Excelsior name was scratched and Cambuslang Football and Athletic Club were formed. In 1879 at a meeting at the Cross Hotel in Hamilton the secretary of Cambuslang was joined by those of Airdrie, Airdriehill, Drumpellier, Hamilton Academical, Glengowan, Clydebank, Uddingston, West Benhar, Benhar and Stonelaw where it was agreed that each club would pay 10 shillings (50p) towards a county cup and the new district would be known as the Lanarkshire County Football Association. Cambuslang would win the Lanarkshire Cup on two occasions and be runners up four times before falling out with the Lanarkshire Football Association and joining the Glasgow Football Association for the 1887‚Äì88 season.

It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. All together, Doutor Coffee has over 1,300 outlets. History Doutor Coffee opened the first European styled caf√© in Harajuku, Japan on 18 April 1980. The size of the small shop was only nine square meters. Despite the small size and local competition, the Doutor Coffee shop succeeded and has expanded to the company that it is now. Doutor Coffee opened its own coffee plantation in 1991 in Kona District, Hawaii. It opened a second plantation in 1995. Roasting coffee Roasting coffee using hot air is a commonly used method by most roasting plants, but it takes away the original flavor of the coffee. Doutor Coffee explored other ways to roast the coffee, but in a more effective way that retains the flavor in the coffee. Doutor Coffee utilizes the flame roasting approach which is laborious and time-extensive, but it allows richly flavored coffee beans. Since flame roasting is used more for small shops due to the fact that it can only roast 5 kg to 20 kg of beans at a time, Doutor Coffee is trying to create an industrialized flame roasting technique.

Opposition to traffic enforcement cameras owned by Redflex has resulted in their removal in some American cities in Texas and California. Bribery investigations In late 2010, Redflex executives were implicated in a bribery investigation in Chicago, Illinois. Following up on a letter from a whistleblower, the Chicago Tribune reported that a Redflex consultant had been making improper payments to a City of Chicago transportation official, John Bills, who was responsible for overseeing the awarding of contracts for the installation and operation of Chicago's widely hated red light camera system. The consultant, Marty O'Malley, who was a long time friend of Bills hired to oversee the Chicago contract, had received in commissions for the contract which had provided approximately million in revenue for Redflex. A two-year internal investigation conducted by Redflex reported in October 2012 that it had found only one instance of an inappropriate expenditure: a two-star hotel stay at the Days Inn for Bills, paid for by the consultant, who was subsequently sent for anti-bribery training. The Chicago contract is the company's largest in North America. With 384 cameras it provides 13% of Redflex Holdings' worldwide revenue.Kidwell, David 3 more Redflex execs out as fallout continues for city's red light camera firm Chicago Tribune 2 March 2013 After the Chicago Tribune found additional evidence of improprieties in the relationship between Redflex executives and consultants and Chicago officials.

The bribery investigation and ensuing events caused trading in Redflex shares to be halted twice. In 2012, the company reported a net profit of $21.3 million; On 11 February 2013 Redflex announced the figure would be adjusted to million due to legal costs which, after taxes of million are paid, would likely result in the company posting a loss.

Style Dosh is principally a percussionist who usually adds a Rhodes piano to his kit and uses other electronic devices such as samplers and looping pedals. He has been characterized as experimental/electronica due to his use of signal- altering devices in performance to allow him to create live solo performances using keyboards, tuned percussion, and drums. Dosh often collaborates with other musicians in recordings and live performances, both as leader and in support. Dosh is also known for the incorporation of his family life into his work. Naoise EP is named after his son. \\"Happy Song for Tadgh\\" from the EP is a reference to Naoise's half-brother, Tadgh. He is also known for writing the song \\"I Think I'm Getting Married\\" for his future wife at the time. History Martin Dosh grew up in the Twin Cities. His musical training began with childhood piano lessons - he did not take up drums until his mid-teens. By the time he left home for Bard College at Simon's Rock at age 16, he had decided music would likely be his profession, however, he subsequently got a degree in creative writing. Throughout the 1990s, Dosh played with a number of bands on the East Coast. When he moved back to Minneapolis in 1997, he started his own band, as he had begun to compose his own music. He also worked at his alma mater, Lake Country School, teaching percussion, driving the school bus, and assisting classroom teachers. Immersing himself in the local scene, Dosh played with many bands over the next five years: Nasty Goat, Best Red, Animals Expert At Hankering, Iffy, Vicious Vicious and T. All this time, he recorded tape after tape of original music on a 4-track machine. Dosh's work with Andrew Broder in Lateduster and Fog gave him an experience that helped him begin to perform solo. In 2002, Dosh released his first album Dosh. He had recorded it himself, mostly in his basement. The album developed a following in the local Twin Cities scene. After playing many shows, City Pages voted him second on their annual \\"picked to click\\" list. Dosh was re-released internationally on Anticon in 2003. It was reviewed in Village Voice, URB, Flaunt, XLR8R, The Big Takeover and a number of online magazines. Dosh has toured extensively with Andrew Bird. He contributed significantly to Andrew Bird's albums, Armchair Apocrypha and Noble Beast. Dosh is a member of The Cloak Ox, a four-piece band featuring Andrew Broder, Jeremy Ylvisaker and Mark Erickson.

Welholme Street crossroads This is almost exactly the same spot as the photograph of the express train. The Peaks Parkway is part of the northern end of the A16 road, in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, England. It was conceived in the 1970s and follows part of the trackbed of the former East Lincolnshire Railway between and . Following on from public pressure, during 2014 North East Lincolnshire Council agreed to increase the speed limit on Peaks Parkway to 40 mph from the 30 mph previously in force, despite Safer Roads Humber advising the council to keep the 30 mph in force. Safer Roads Humber had been accused of using Peaks Parkway as a cash cow for funding, using SPECS average speed cameras as a revenue generator. Anyone unfamiliar with Peaks Parkway at first glance wouldn't imagine a major road of this standard would have a low speed limit of 30 mph. For example, pedestrians are prohibited from using Peaks Parkway. Background When British Rail could no longer justify the maintenance of the Louth line, Grimsby Borough Council agreed to research the route as a major traffic artery into and through the town centre. Engineering Consultants were appointed and quickly confirmed the route would have strategic significance for the town and provide a link from the south to the A180 which was being constructed to the north of the urban area. Unusually the route would not require the demolition of any property. This plan was well received by the Councillors who had previously approved a traffic plan for the area which proposed the construction of a ring road and a road running alongside the route of the former railway into the town centre (Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick Report 1972). The route alongside the railway would have required the demolition of 480 properties but was justified on the benefits that the scheme would bring to the residents of the town as a whole through improved communication links. The Councillors were keen to support a road which could be built entirely within former railway land along the majority of its route and not require the demolition of any property. A group of railway enthusiasts had obtained an option from British Rail to reactivate the line as a private public railway between Grimsby and Louth. This option was granted prior to the publication of the road proposals. However, the railway supporters faced an impossible task in raising sufficient funds to replace the many tonnes of ballast that had been sold off by British Rail upon the closure of the line as a working entity and eventually conceded that their plan would not materialise. The group went on to form the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway on a smaller section of the trackbed south of Grimsby. =Formation of Humberside County Council= Upon the formation of Humberside County Council in 1974, the former County Borough pressed the County to include the scheme for the construction of a road along the former railway line in the Capital Roads Programme. The County Council acceded to the request and together with a new road linking Baxtergate, near the Riverhead, to Hainton Square, was incorporated in the programme. Under the leadership of John Board, Director of Development at Grimsby Borough Council, proposals for rejuvenating the Riverhead Shopping Centre in Grimsby Town Centre were created which included covering of the existing 1960's style open air shopping mall and an extension over the surrounding car parks. The team included officers of the Council; Keith Archer, Chief Planning Officer, Terry Thurogood, Senior Planning Officer, Allan Thompson, Chief Engineer, Graham Stafford, Chief Architect and Johnathan Sworn, Hammerson UK Ltd., their Architects, Building Design Partnership and representatives from Donaldson's the managing agents of the Centre. In 1992, the Royal Town Planning Institute awarded the redesigned and renamed, Freshney Place Shopping Centre a Commendation Award. =The Bargate Scheme= Baxtergate was a two lane road which was located between the Riverhead Centre and the surrounding car parks and was left over after the ambitious plans for a Town Centre bypass were scuppered by a Public Inquiry into a scheme which required the widening of Bargate near to the junction with Dudley Street, Grosvenor Street and Cartergate. Originally, Baxtergate was planned to flow in a single direction around the back of the shopping centre where there would be bus stops to allow passengers to alight directly from the buses into the shopping centre. On the demise of the bypass scheme following a Public Inquiry, Baxtergate was retained as a one-way street in the opposite direction to that planned and four pedestrian underpasses were hurriedly constructed to allow pedestrians to cross from the surface car parks to the shopping centre without having to cross traffic and bus stops which were constructed on the car park side of the road. The subways were a constant problem for the Council, being prone to flooding and the location of physical attacks on unwary shoppers and bus passengers. =Baxtergate= The development team proposed the realignment of Baxtergate to a position alongside the bank of the River Freshney and Hammerson were encouraged to extend the shopping centre to the new alignment of the road, building two multi-storey car parks, one at each end of the development, to replace the surface level parking. The deal that was eventually approved by the Council, provided for the multi-storey car parks to be handed over to the Council for operation on completion so that the public car parking provision in the town centre could be co-ordinated. Subsequently, at the time that the payment for the area of the surface was due, Hammerson negotiated the retention of the cars parking under their control. Humberside County Council, as highway authority, were persuaded that the relocation of Baxtergate was essential to the development of the Town Centre and as they would derive benefit from the sale of the land on which Baxtergate was located, they agreed in principle to the scheme. Principal Humberside County Council Technical Services Department officers involved at the time were Dave Rennie, Roger Williams, and Bob Keld. Phases of construction Crucial to the scheme to enlarge the shopping centre was the linking of the realignment of Baxtergate to the railway route. Baxtergate realignment and its extension across the Riverhead to Victoria Street became Phase One. The construction of a new route from the Baxtergate / Victoria Street junction under the Grimsby to Cleethorpes railway ending at Hainton Square became Phase Two and the railway route from the Victoria Street junction to a new roundabout north of New Waltham became Phase Three. =Phase 1= Humberside County Council, in close liaison with the Borough Council, constructed the new road to allow the expansion of the shopping centre and in honour of a highly regarded former Town Clerk of the County Borough of Grimsby, named the road Frederick Ward Way. Part of the scheme saw the creation of a riverside walkway adjacent to the River Freshney. A new footbridge erected by the Borough Council linked the Town Centre to the newly created National Fishing Heritage Centre. The project included a new bridge across the Riverhead (latterly called the 'Simwhite' Bridge after an earlier bridge in the town, and a road through the former Dial Square surface Car Park to Victoria Street North. =Phase 2= The East Marsh Street link provided a direct link to Hainton Square and the Freeman Street shopping area and routed traffic away from the circuitous existing route which used Victoria Street, Pasture Street, Robinson Street East and East Marsh Street. This scheme required the construction of a subway beneath a live railway line in very poor ground and was completed just prior to the demise of Humberside County Council. A new junction with Railway Street was designed to accommodate traffic from a new retail store (Asda) which had been attracted by the prospects of improved traffic access to the area. At Hainton Square, a new traffic signal junction incorporating pedestrian crossing facilities was created. the completion of the construction of this part of the scheme was accompanied by extensive alterations to traffic flow along streets in the area and a major change was made on Eleanor Street which was made a One-Way Street with easterly flow between Freeman Street and Convamore Road. =Phase 3= The major part of the Peaks Parkway Scheme was the construction of the road along a portion of the former Grimsby to Louth railway line and this was undertaken by the new North East Lincolnshire Council which was an amalgamation of the former Grimsby and Cleethorpes District Councils. Fortunately, the same officers that worked on the scheme prior to disbanding the County Council, were available to implement the scheme which was completed in October 1998. Phase 3 created a new traffic signal junction at Victoria Street, Frederick Ward Way and Ellis Way (named after a prestigious Grimsby Councillor, Peter Ellis). A new underpass was built beneath Pasture Street and the Grimsby Town to Cleethorpes railway during which several night time rail line possessions from British Rail, to allow the bridge deck to be slid beneath the rail lines. The construction of Phase 3 of Peaks Parkway attracted developers who considered how to make use of the new traffic routes and a new junction was built just north of a footpath link between Doughty Road and Catherine Street to service a new retail development including Halfords and B&Q.; The footpath between Doughty Road and Catherine Street was maintained with the construction of a pedestrian subway which was decorated by a community group called 'Artlandish'. At this time extensive changes were made to traffic flows around the town centre and a 'one-way' system on Bethlehem Street, South St. Mary's Gate and Osborne Street reverted to two-way flow. The length of Victoria Street between East St. Mary's Gate and Old Market Place, and Old Market Place itself were paved and made pedestrian only with rear access provision being made for vehicles to allow deliveries to shops and offices. The junction with Welholme Road saw the disappearance of a platform that previously served the Grimsby to Louth Railway and the level crossing but the former station masters house still exists. View from Peaks Lane Fire Station Tower, to the NorthWest The soundproofing wall with its geometric pattern can be seen lining the former railway route. Residential terraced houses in Highfield and Peakesfield Avenues which are set parallel to the railway line were formerly part of the Lord Heneage Estate. The 'freehold' of many of the houses had been bought by the occupants but the leaseholder of many was still the Heneage Estate and compensation under The Land Compensation Act had to be negotiated with all properties that were deemed to be, at least in part, within a zone where predicted noise levels were to be above 1 decibel above a base level of 68 decibels. The effects of road noise were to be mitigated by the construction of a brick wall high. Several designs for the wall were considered but architects eventually decided upon a geometric pattern of bricks in two colours. The properties in Highfield and Peakesfield Avenues had been constructed some distance from the former railway line as a safety measure as steam powered locomotives were renowned for emitting sparks. A footpath in front of the houses was privately maintained and the area between the footpath and the bottom of the embankment on which the railway was built also belonged to the individual houses. Some of these private areas were poorly maintained and the council proposed to compulsory purchase the land and footpath to better provide for future maintenance. A Landscape Architect Consultant was appointed to develop a comprehensive scheme which was eventually agreed and implemented. SA an offshoot to the major works, some accommodation work was undertaken in Ainslie Street Recreation Ground and Park to install street lighting on the meandering footpaths and improve the paving to a safe condition. This was the site of a former cemetery and due care had to be taken by the Engineers designing the scheme and the contractors in installing the improvements. At Weelsby Road, there existed previously, a subway beneath the Grimsby to Louth Railway and to provide access to the new road, the subway was filled in and a new traffic signal junction created. Some residential property was purchased by agreement and this allowed the construction of slip lanes from Weelsby Road to the new Peaks Parkway and Peaks Parkway itself to be widened to allow 2 lanes in each direction immediately at the junction. In order to reduce problems caused by queuing traffic, traffic signals at the Hainton Avenue junction with Weelsby Road were linked to operate together with the new junction at Weelsby Road / Peaks Parkway. Pedestrian facilities were included in all new traffic signal installations. The Fire Brigade, from nearby Peaks Lane Fire Station are able to switch the signals to all-red to allow tenders to leave the station in an emergency situation, thereby improving response times. View from Peaks Lane Fire Station Tower, to the southwest The soundproofing wall with its geometric pattern can be seen lining the former railway route. The noise reduction wall was continued south of the junction with Weelsby Road to shield all residential property which abutted the former railway. The new road along this section occupied less land than the former railway which was constructed on an embankment. After the completion of the scheme, land between the residential property boundaries and the noise reduction wall was given to the property owners for on a 'peppercorn' lease to allow them to incorporate it within their property curtilage. It was anticipated in the design of the road that there would be no frontage access to the new road along the entire length between the New Waltham roundabout and Victoria Street. A former farm access bridge known locally as Peaks Tunnel, which was also used as part of a public footpath, was reconstructed on the existing location. Part way along the long straight section south of Weelsby Road, along the southern boundary of the YMCA grounds, a public footpath was constructed to link with Peaks Lane and continued south along the Peaks Parkway to the new roundabout north of New Waltham. From here the footpath continued into New Waltham along the route of the former railway to emerge on Station road, New Waltham at the former level crossing. Just south of this level crossing was the site of the former station at which was later demolished and the land sold for housing development.

These defences were constructed to protect the Australian city of Sydney from attack by enemy warships and submarines.Australian War Memorial http://www.awm.gov.au/diaries/ww2/folder.asp?folder=175 Australian Army war diaries - Sydney Fortress Pre-Federation defences The Georges Head Battery (1871) Sydney's earliest fortifications were built around Sydney Cove to protect the new colony of Sydney from attacks from non-British ships or convict uprisings. The first gun emplacement was built in 1801 on Middle Head (north of Obelisk Bay) during the Napoleonic wars. More permanent fortifications were built during the first half of the 19th century in response to feared foreign attacks www.shfa.nsw.gov.au/uploads and new threats to the British empire. In 1790 the Dawes Point Battery was meant to be the first line of defence against an attack by the Spanish Empire, Napoleon‚Äôs French troops in 1810, and the Russian Pacific Fleet in the 1850s (during the Crimean War). This was part of a line of defences that were concentrated on protecting the inner Harbour, these also appear to have been given a low priority. Construction of Fort Denison began in 1841, though the fort was not completed until 1857.Defence heritage in & around Sydney HarbourBen Buckler Gun Battery 1893ThePlan Sydney's defences were expanded following the withdrawal (Cardwell Reforms) of British soldiers from Australia during the 1870s. This prompted the construction of four sets of fortifications on Georges Heights and around other parts of the harbour, the Middle Head Fortifications, the Georges Head Battery, the Lower Georges Heights Commanding Position and a smaller fort located on Bradleys Head were constructed during this period and upgraded in the 1880s on the advice of British experts. They were designed to attack enemy ships as they attempted entry into Sydney Harbour. Some of these forts were, at the time, built of an out dated design. The Beehive Casemate was carved into the cliff face at Obelisk Bay on Sydney Harbour in 1871 A Submarine Miners' Depot was constructed at Chowder Bay (Georges Head) in the 1880s. In 1888 the site was modified for the latest in harbour defences. The site was a strategic position and considered the best place to observe and fire mines which were laid underwater. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners (Clifton Gardens). From Georges Head, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. Their job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to the firing post.Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Sites - Headland Park Army - The Soldiers' Newspaper The work of the submarine miner was secretive, technical and dangerous. During a demonstration in 1891, a crowd of several thousand watched as a terrible accident killed four miners and injured another eight.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0152.JPG The Submarine Mining Corps was dismantled in 1922. Sydney's defences were expanded over the last decades of the 19th century and eventually incorporated a fort on Bare Island to defend the approaches to Botany Bay. World War II The British aircraft carrier passing through the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net in 1945 Sydney's defences were not expanded from their pre-Federation condition until the 1920s. During the 1920s a number of well-constructed fortifications were built to protect Sydney. Sydney's defences were further expanded following the outbreak of World War II and were considerably augmented once Japan entered the war. While Sydney's anti-submarine defences were not yet complete at the time of the attack on Sydney Harbour on the night of 31 May 1942, they were successful in sinking two of the three Japanese midget submarines which attempted to enter the Harbour; one submarine fired two torpedoes at a warship, both of which missed, one hitting another ship. The end of coastal defence Following the end of the Japanese threat to Australia Sydney's defences were reduced from 1944. The last fortifications were not decommissioned until the 1960s, however. While Sydney is no longer protected by fixed defences, a high proportion of the Australian Defence Force is based within the greater Sydney region and could be called on to protect the city during an emergency.

Depot ships may be identified as tenders in American English. Depot ships may be specifically designed for their purpose or be converted from another purpose.Submarine depot ship with a flotilla of submarines Function Depot ships provide services unavailable from local naval base shore facilities. Industrialized countries may build naval bases with extensive workshops, warehouses, barracks, and medical and recreation facilities. Depot ships operating within such bases may provide little more than command staff offices,Lenton (1975) pp.391-394 while depot ships operating at remote bases may perform unusually diverse support functions. Some United States Navy submarine depot ships operating in the Pacific during World War II included sailors with Construction Battalion ratings to clear recreational sites and assemble buildings ashore, while the Royal Navy mobile naval bases included specialized amenities ships to meet recreational needs of British Pacific Fleet personnel.Lenton & Colledge, pp.333&335 Services provided by a depot ship depend upon whether typical client warship missions are measured in hours, or days, or weeks. A warship crew may be expected to remain at their stations for missions measured in hours, but longer missions may require provisions for dining, sleeping, and personal hygiene. The crew of small warships may carry individual combat rations and urinate or defecate from the weather deck. Longer missions typically require storage provisions for drinking water and preserved food, and some resting area for the crew, although rest may be limited to a sheltered spot to sit or recline. Cooking may be limited to warming food on an exhaust vent, and buckets may be used for bathing, laundry, and sanitary waste. Habitability standards vary among navies, but client warships large enough to include a head, bunks, a shower, a kitchen stove, refrigerated food storage, a drinking water distillation unit, and a laundry require little more than medical and repair service from a depot ship. Depot ships are similar to repair ships, but provide a wider range of services to a smaller portion of the fleet. Depot ships undertake repair work for a flotilla of small warships, while repair ships offer more comprehensive repair capability for a larger variety of fleet warships. Depot ships also provide personnel and resupply services for their flotilla. Some depot ships may transport their short-range landing or attack craft from home ports to launch near the scene of battle.

In the Royal Navy, under section 87 of the Naval Discipline Act 1866, the provisions of the act only applied to officers and men of the Royal Navy borne on the books of a warship.

Between 1950 and 1952, it notched up a number of hits under the New York based Ansonia Records banner of Rafael P√©rez. In its name, the band claimed to be authentic (tipico) El Cibao music - this is the region in north Dominican Republic, where merengue had its origins. The tipico merengue features a slightly faster tempo, and keeps the accordion sound, as opposed to the jazz-influenced music of Luis Alberti who had adapted merengue to a more urban ethos in the 1940s. The style of Angel Viloria's band however reflected more of the urban Alberti influence than the name admits; the accordion was of course, quite tipico. By 1953, the band had split up, with Viloria, Quintero, and Valladares forming separate groups. This band was a great inspiration to the creation of Konpa music in Haiti.

Creggan (; meaning stony place) is a large housing estate in Derry, Northern Ireland, on a hill on the outskirts of the city. The estate is very close to the border with County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. History =Pre-Troubles= Creggan was originally built specifically to provide housing for the growing population of Derry. There was a Nationalist majority in the city, but the Unionist minority of the then Londonderry Corporation wanted to ensure they kept control of the city. When the Bogside became overcrowded in the 1940s to 1960s, the Corporation agreed to put Nationalist and mainly Catholic families in housing, in the same ward as the Bogside. This ensured continued Unionist control of the Londonderry Corporation. This process is known as gerrymandering. As well as the use of gerrymandering by the Corporation, there was also the use of 'restricted franchise' by the Government, where only rate payers had the right to vote. Usually the male head of a family (or matriarch if the male was dead), the person in whose name the rent book was held, was registered to vote. No other adult in the same household could vote. Middle class and upper class people who owned more than one property in the city had the right to vote more than once. While this political dimension was important, it was the lack of suitable housing for people, mainly Nationalists, which was the most pressing problem, with married couples living with their parents or with family who had housing in the new estates. This type of social injustice gave rise to the civil rights movement in the city in the 1960s. =The Troubles= The civil rights movement that was occurring in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, took place consistently in Derry. This led to an outbreak of violence between the police, local Unionist Supporters and Nationalists. Violence in the city originally started in the Bogside but quickly spread out to the rest of the city, which included Creggan. One of these occurrences during 12 to 14 August 1969 became known as the Battle of the Bogside. A disagreement over defending Nationalists from British State forces and elements of Unionism led to a split in the IRA, and the two new paramilitary organizations became known as the Official IRA and Provisional IRA. In the early years, 1969 to 1972, the Officials were the most prominent in Creggan and the rest of Northern Ireland with militant members such as Joe McCann carrying attacks out on the British Army, even though the Provisionals as a whole were carrying out a more violent campaign along with a bombing campaign in Derry City Centre. Following the introduction of internment without trial being carried out by the British government, the Bogside and Creggan effectively became a no-go area for the British government and was only controlled and policed by both wings of the IRA. This all existed until Operation Motorman in July 1972. After this, the no-go area across Ulster became fully controlled by the British government. However, this did not at all stop violence in the city. In 1972 the Officials called a ceasefire, then in 1974 called an end to their armed campaign. This prompted the creation of the Irish National Liberation Army, a radical left wing group formed of hardliner republicans led by Seamus Costello. By 1972, after Motorman, the British Army conducted large scale operations in the once no-go areas. It caused more open clashes between the British Army, the citizens of Creggan and the rest of Derry. This violence continued to occur up to the early 1990s. =Subsequent history= Creggan has experienced a seismic change; long gone are the no-go area and levels of inequality suffered from the 1960s to 1980s. It has seen some redevelopment most noticeably with the redevelopment of the Bishop's Field as a sports and recreation area, the introduction of a play park and the development of a country park and fishery at the old reservoir sites at the edge of the estate. New housing developments have also been completed on the edge of the estate, the largest of these being the new Ballymagowan area. Schools in the area have also been significantly redeveloped and much investment has gone into providing a first class education for school children from all across Derry. On 18 April 2019, 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee was fatally shot during rioting in Fanad Drive. Police initially suggested the New IRA were responsible for the killing. The New IRA later confirmed responsibility and offered apologies.

They had hit songs with \\"Hey Girl\\", \\"Beep Beep Love\\", \\"Tokyo (I'm On My Way)\\", \\"Disco Really Made It\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\". The frontman of the band, and writer of the material, is Hans Vandenburg. The band went on hiatus in 2013. Early 2018 a reunion was announced consisting of a tour and a new album called Great, which was released to critical acclaim in April 2018. Beginnings The band formed in the 1970s, and rode to national popularity playing new wave music. The creative force was Hans Vandenburg (guitar and vocals), with Max Mollinger (drums), Peter Calicher (keyboards), Eric Wehrmeyer (bass), and the \\"Gruppettes\\" Jos√©e van Iersel and Meike Touw (vocals). The band played pop songs whose lyrics contained humor, situational comedy, and inside musical jokes. 10 Mistakes & Back To 78 Their first single was Out There In The Jungle (Polydor 1976), but the height of their career came with the two albums 10 Mistakes (1977) and Back to '78 (1978). They came to popularity just after the height of punk rock, but were regarded as more post-punk, veering more towards the mainstream pop. \\"Dreamin\\", a song from the album 10 Mistakes received some college radio airplay in the US. They were admired for their live performances, which had great humor and slapstick. Their best known song is Beep Beep Love (from the album 10 Mistakes), which enjoyed some success both in the UK and US. The UK's Radio & Records voted them \\"Top Newcomer '78\\". Other classics originating from the milestone albums include Tokyo, Hey Girl, I Said No, Lasting Forever, Shave, Rock 'n' Roll and Mission √† Paris. The albums were produced by Robert Jan Stips (Supersister, Golden Earring, The Nits). After releasing the single Sleeping Bag Hans Vandenburg disbanded Gruppo Sportivo at the height of their popularity. He got the band back together for Copy Copy in 1980, after the release of his solo debut album Buddy Odor Is a Gas (1979). Only Calicher and Mollinger remained from the original line-up.  From Copy Copy to Sing Sing  From 1980 to 1984 the band released the albums Copy Copy (1980, with Deaf School's Bette Bright on vocals and featuring songs such as Up To Date, Life in Tokyo and What Happened To Romance?), Pop! Goes the Brain (1981, featuring Holland Now, Rhythmisaconstantbeat and My Old Cortina) and Designe Moderne (1982, featuring Happily Unemployed, On Her Own and Go 'n' Get It), which brought a shift of success to mainly Germany, Italy and Spain. Sombrero Times followed in 1984 and was the band's first album released by an independent label. It featured the singles Two Tickets To Rio and Radar. After splitting up for a couple of years, the band returned with compilation album Back to 19 Mistakes in 1988, which included their popular Wall of Voodoo cover Mexican Radio. It was followed by Sucker of the Century (1989), Young & Out (1992, featuring radiohit She Was Pretty, Repeatlemania and new jazzy version of Hey Girl) and the acoustic live album Sing Sing (1993). Sing Sing included new versions of hits (a.o. Disco Really Made It, Mission √† Paris and Beep Beep Love), album- tracks (a.o. Repeatlemania, Shave and Hollywood) and new songs (a.o. I Would Dance). The band toured Europe with the Bombita's (Lies Schilp and Inge Bonthond) on vocals. After Sing Sing Hans Vandenburg released his solo albums Commercial Break (1994, including the rocker This Day Is Fine, which was accompanied by a video directed by Theo van Gogh) and Shake Hands with Vandenburg (1996). These albums were followed by Uit het Leven Gegrepen (1998), the debut album by his new band Dierenpark, the first album Vandenburg wrote in Dutch.  Topless 16, Rock Now Roll Later & The Secret of Success  After releasing Married with Singles in 2000, a compilation album with all the singles and b-sides from 1976 to 1988 (plus two new songs Click Here and I Don't Think So), the original band re-united for a handful of dates, including a high-profile show at 'Sail 2000', which was broadcast on TV. In 2004 the band released the album Topless 16 featuring 16 new songs, including the single and video Superman Is Back, referencing both the iconic movie hero and their own classic 10 Mistakes song Superman. The album - their first with new songs only since Young & Out in 1991 - featured Gert Jan Konink on bass. Other songs and live favourites included Ray of Light, Your Words Are Free and Non Stop Girl. It was followed in 2006 by Rock Now, Roll Later a compilation album featuring the band's singles from 1989 to 1996. It included two new songs: live favourite DoReMiFaSoLaTiDo and Green Utopia Bay, one of their best songs ever, according to Vandenburg. In July 2006, the Japanese girl band, Puffy AmiYumi, recorded a new version of \\"Tokyo\\", originally recorded by Gruppo Sportivo in 1978. To mark their 35th anniversary the band recorded the acoustic album The Secret of Success (2011), featuring new versions of songs from all over their career. From Henri to Hey Girl and from James Last Car to new song Pop Eyes. The album was accompanied by an extensive theatre tour. Looking back on the album on their official Facebook page in June 2015, the band stated that they considered My Uncle's Ben's Picture Book a highlight. All three albums were released on Spotify between 2011 and 2013.  10 Mistakes re-release & farewell tour  In 2012 ‚Äì 35 years after the original release ‚Äì the band re-released their debut album 10 Mistakes, with five additional songs. A theatre and club tour followed in 2012-2013. During the shows the complete album was performed, combined with other Gruppo Sportivo classics and cover songs that inspired 10 Mistakes. On December 28, 2013, the band performed its last show at The Patronaat in Haarlem, Holland.  Dig It Yourself and Back to '78 re-release  Gruppo Sportivo is currently on a hiatus ('studio only band' according to Vandenburg). In June 2015 Vandenburg (aka Van DeFruits) released his solo album Dig It Yourself, which included Gimme Your Love, Grow Grow Grow, Nine Inch Nails re-make Various Methods of Escape and Groovin', a song he originally wrote with the late Dutch singer Herman Brood in the 80's.

Great entered the Dutch Album Top 100 at #46, the band's first chart entry with an album of new original songs since Copy Copy in 1980. It entered the Album Top 40 the week after on the back of more raving reviews in OOR Magazine ('Great is Gruppo's best album since Back To 78') and Telegraaf a.o. To celebrate the release of Great classic albums Back To 78, Copy Copy, Pop! Goes The Brain, Design Moderne and the Hans Vandenburg/Gruppo Sportivo-project Buddy Odor is a Gas! (by The Buddy Odor Stop, featuring the still occasionally performed Cats Hiss) were finally released digitally on Spotify, Deezer and iTunes/Apple Music.

From 1978 to 1979, he served as Special Assistant to Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he worked on issues relating to the dollar crisis. Returning to Brown Brothers, he established and managed the bank's Dallas-based Texas operations. Leaving Brown Brothers in 1987, Fisher created Fisher Capital Management, and a separate funds-management firm, Fisher Ewing Partners, managing both firms until 1997. In 1993, he was a candidate in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas, which was vacated by Lloyd Bentsen when the latter became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, but took fifth place in a 21 candidate field behind State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator Bob Krueger, U.S. Congressman Joe Barton, and U.S. Congressman Jack Fields. The following year, he was a candidate for the same U.S. Senate seat in the regularly scheduled election. Fisher came in second to former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox in the Democratic Party primary, but won the ensuing run-off election. Fisher lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison having been defeated 61% to 38%. From 1997 to 2001, Fisher served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, serving under U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, where he was responsible for the implementation of NAFTA, and negotiating a variety of trade agreements, including the bilateral accords admitting both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. From 2001 to 2005, he served as Vice Chairman of Kissinger McLarty Associates, a strategic advisory firm headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty. He left the firm in April, 2005, when he was appointed as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas serving in that post until 2015. Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee in May 2007 showed Fisher sounded the alarm on the housing crisis even as many of his peers on the Committee expressed doubts: \\"On the housing front, I have been bearish‚Äîmore bearish than anybody at this table. I am more concerned than I was before. We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines.\\" Reality worse than headlines Kristina Peterson, Michael S. Derby, Eric Morath, and Jon Hilsenrath, \\"Three Stages of Fed Grief: Key Quotes from 2007,\\" Wall Street Journal, January 18, 2013.

Retrieved 2013-02-27. As US equity markets began to unravel barely two weeks after Yellen's December 18 rate hike announcement, Fisher came out on CNBC decrying the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to launch QE3 saying that he, \\"voted against doing QE3\\" and that QE3 was, \\"one step too far.\\"Fisher, Richard, \\"Fisher's revelatory interview on CNBC \\" Fisher is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.

Born in Richibucto, New Brunswick to Henry O'Leary and Mary O'Leary, he received his higher education from St. Joseph's College in Memramcook then studied Theology at the Grand Seminary in Montreal. On September 21, 1901, O'Leary was ordained a priest in Richibucto. The same year he went to Rome, where he later earned doctorates in Theology, Philosophy, and Canon Law. In 1907 O'Leary was appointed priest for the Sacred Heart Parish in Bathurst, New Brunswick. The following year, he was appointed Vicar General for the Diocese of Chatham. In 1913 O'Leary became Bishop for the Diocese of Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island but as St. Dunstan's Basilica in Charlottetown had recently burned down, O'Leary was consecrated at the Sacred Heart Church in Bathurst. One of his first acts was to have a new cathedral built on the site of the ruined Basilica. It was completed during O'Leary's tenure and opened in 1919. In World War I many Diocesan parishioners joined the armed services and several priests became chaplains. During this time, the new Saint Vincent Orphanage was completed to replace the old one in Charlottetown. O'Leary founded a convent in 1916 when the Sisters of St. Martha of Prince Edward Island was established. In 1919, during his tenure, St. Dunstan's College, which had been started years ago by Bishop Bernard McDonald on the closure of St. Andrew's College, became a university with the power to grant its own degrees. The first fundraising for the university raised over $40,000. The Charlottetown Hospital, which had been backed by Bishop Peter McIntyre in the 19th century continued to grow as a new maternity department opened in 1918 and a school of nursing was established in 1920. The hospital was under the supervision of the Grey Nuns of Quebec, whose presence had been felt in the Diocese of Charlottetown for many years. After seven years as Bishop of Charlottetown, O'Leary was appointed Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Edmonton, in the Western Canadian region. Archbishop Henry Joseph O'Leary died in 1938. His remains were interred in St. Joachim's Cemetery in Edmonton. The Archbishop O'Leary Catholic High School in Edmonton, founded in the 1960s, was named after him.

Published by Acclaim and developed by Charybdis, Machines was one of the first 3D games of this genre. It also allowed players to directly control units with both a first and third-person view.  Gameplay  Machines uses a 3D polygonal landscape, which players can use to their advantage, attacking from or hiding behind hilltops. The viewpoint can be switched between a default isometric, strategic 'zenith' camera, and first person perspective; the latter typically being used to explore buildings during espionage missions. 50 different machines can be researched and built, characterized by a plasma-based techtree and a projectile-based techtree combined with different methods of movement (Examples: 4 or 6 Spider legs, Wheels, Tracks, Hover-engines, Flying, 2 Legs). Furthermore, battalions can be developed with specific strengths to support a personalized fighting strategy. The game also includes 25 different weapons, including Flame-throwers, Vortex Singularities, Plasma Rifles, Mini-guns, Ion Cannons and Nukes. Sabotage and espionage missions allow units to deposit mines inside enemy buildings, steal research, and pass back vital information. Machines is multiplayer over a LAN or the internet. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"At the end of the day, Machines doesn't really add anything to the RTS genre, but it's well-crafted, solid game that's original enough to keep your attention for as long as it takes to beat the game.\\" GameSpot awarded the game 6.5 out of 10, praising the impressive graphics and camera modes but highlighting the poor unit pathfinding and unoriginal gameplay.Acclaim Machines CD Art & music reviews - CNET Reviews GameMonkeys gave it 4 out of 5, saying that the game had \\"great graphics, and totally in- depth gameplay\\".

It was originally built to serve settlements along the north shore of the Firth of Forth, between Alloa and Dunfermline. It was opened in two stages by the North British Railway: from Alloa to Kincardine in 1893, and the eastern section in 1903. Passenger traffic was disappointing, and closed in 1930. Goods traffic was poorly used as well, that is until in 1962, when a large coal-fired power station opened on the line. A second followed, and the entire line was re-opened in stages to bring in coal for the power station requirements. The power stations were decommissioned in 2016, bringing heavy mineral traffic to an end. There is a possibility of re-opening to passenger trains on the route. First railways Railways of the Kincardine lineDuring the promotion of railways in 1845 that resulted in the major expansion of the Scottish railway network, the Scottish Central Railway was authorised to build from Castlecary, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, to Perth through Stirling. On the eastern side, the Edinburgh and Northern Railway was authorised to build from Burntisland to Perth and Tayport, for Dundee. The Edinburgh and Northern also obtained permission to build a branch line from Thornton to Dunfermline. The following year, 1846, saw the authorisation of the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway, running through Alloa. All these lines were substantially complete by 1849. The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway had a Clackmannan station and a Kincardine station, but both those places were some considerable distance from the railway. The attraction of Dunfermline as a railway objective was the mineral resources, especially coal in the Dunfermline coalfield. Early proposals Kincardine had long had importance as a ferry crossing of the Forth, and in 1888 the North British Railway proposed a line connecting a junction near Clackmannan station with Kincardine, as well as acquisition of the ferry. However this was a low priority for the NBR at that time, and the idea came to nothing. Alloa to Kincardine By 1865, both the Edinburgh and Northern Railway and the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway had become part of the North British Railway, while the Scottish Central Railway had become a part of the rival Caledonian Railway. The Caledonian had a dense network of railways in central Scotland, and continually hoped to reach the east coast ports and the rich Fife coalfield. The North British Railway responded by promoting its own lines serving the areas thought to be of interest to the Caledonian, so as to be able to demonstrate to Parliament that they were adequately serving the districts. Kirkcaldy was known to be a Caledonian objective, and the North British obtained authorisation to build a line from near Alloa to Kilbagie and Kincardine. The line was opened on 18 December 1893.Stansfield (in Stirling and Clackmannanshire's and also in Fife's) says to Kilbagie only on 18 December 1893.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, Edinburgh Evening News - Monday 18 December 1893Gordon Stansfield, Stirling and Clackmannanshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2002, Gordon Stansfield, Fife's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 1998, The line ran from a few miles east of Alloa on the Dunfermline line, at a new junction called Kincardine Junction, through Clackmannan, Kilbagie, Kincardine, Culross, Torryburn and Cairneyhill to Elbowend Junction, where it joined the Charlestown branch line of the NBR. From there trains reached Comely Park station in Dunfermline (later Dunfermline Lower). The Kincardine and Dunfermline Railway A branch line to Kincardine was not enough to satisfy the demands for a better railway service in the area, and connecting Kincardine and Dunfermline was proposed. The Kincardine and Dunfermline Railway was the result, authorised by the North British Railway (General Powers) Act, 1898. It was to leave the Charlestown line at Meadowend and then run by Cairneyhill, Torryburn and Culross to meet the end of the existing Kincardine branch at Kincardine Pier. Getting the Act kept the Caledonian Railway out, and actually constructing the railway was a lower priority. In fact the North British Railway had to apply for an extension of time to complete the line, in January 1903. The local authorities opposed the application, suspecting that the NBR had no intention of actually completing it. In fact the contract for the work was let in January 1904, and the line opened on 2 July 1906.Fife Free Press; also Ross, page 187 and 245, and Brotchie and Jack; Turnock says opened Kincardine to Dunfermline 30 June 1906 on page 38, and 20 June 1906 Kincardine to Culross on page 312 and 1 July 1906 Dunfermline to Culross. The Meadowend to Elbowend section was on the alignment of the Elgin Railway of 1812, and from Meadowend to Lochymuir it was on the route of the 1783 waggonway. The Fife Free Press reported the opening: \\"A fairly large number of passengers travelled on the newly branch railway to and from Kincardine which was opened to traffic on Monday [2 June 1906]. In the morning train from Kincardine about eighty persons came to the Dunfermline Lower station.\\"Fife Free Press, & Kirkcaldy Guardian - Saturday 7 July 1906 but the same newspaper was pessimistic about the economic activity of the locality: \\"The line passes through a district very rich in mineral, which only awaits development, and opens up a charming bit of country abounding in historical and antiquarian associations. At one time the district in direct touch with the new railway was very much busier than now, having in fact seen better days, but the opening of the new line, which commences by a junction with the Dunfermline and Charlestown branch at Elbowend, with stations at Torryburn, Culross, and Kincardine-on-Forth, may be expected to waken it into new life.\\" Four passenger trains ran each way daily, with a fifth on Saturdays; but two of the trains were short workings from Alloa to kincardine, so the new line only had two trains each way. The three intermediate stations were described as commodious.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The passenger service was not well used, and it ceased from 7 July 1930. After 1930 The goods service on the line was also poorly used, and it too closed in 1964. An unexpected revival took place when two large coal-fired electricity generating stations were built near the line: Kincardine power station opened in 1962, but has now closed (in 1990) and Longannet power station, opened in 1970. Both these power stations had a huge demand for coal, which was brought in by rail from the Dunfermline end, so that the eastern section of the route was re-opened. Changing patterns of coal delivery led to coal imported to Hunterston in Ayrshire being brought to Longannet from 2008, running via Alloa and the western end of the line, which is therefore now complete again. Nonetheless, Kincardine power station has long been closed and Longannet closed on 24 March 2016, so that freight train use of the line appears now to have no long term future. It has been proposed that this \\"enables\\" re-opening of the line to passenger traffic, extending from Alloa to Dunfermline. It is not clear at present whether this is viable.

The Cunninghamhead Estate is in the 21st century mainly a residential caravan park with two private residences near Irvine, Scotland. It was once a private estate, owned by a sequence of recorded families since around 1418. The Mansion House, one of Britain's lost houses, was built in 1747; it was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s, whilst renovation work was being carried out. The old mansion and castle have been lost, however the stables are still a residence, whilst the Gardner's Cottage survive as ruins. From 1964, work was carried out, first to use the estate as a chicken farm and later as holiday and residential, caravan park and camping site, making most of the rural location. Circa 2003 the site was significantly redeveloped to become a residential caravan park exclusively for the use of retired and semi-retired persons. The history of the Cunninghamhead Estate The previous name of the area was Woodhead, the name change to Cunninghamhead taking place before 1418; a charter dated 1346 from King David II to Godfrey de Ross refers to him as being 'of Coyninghamheid'.MacDonald, Ian (2006). Cunninghamhead came into the Cuninghame family in the early 15th century when Robert married the Douglas heiress of that estate. From that time on, the head of the family was known as the Laird of Cunninghamhead.The Cuninghame family of Cunninghamhead Retrieved : 2012-01-23 Gordon's map of 1654 shows 'Cuningham Head' and 'Rungham' is marked on Moll's 1745 map. Cunninghamhead Castle was a square tower, referred to as a \\"strong old donjon\\" by Pont and demolished by John Snodgrass in 1747 when a mansion house was built.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont 1604-1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Glasgow : John Tweed. The original meaning of the term 'donjon' referred to the mound or motte, not the dungeons.Mackenzie, W. Mackay (1927). The Mediaeval Castle in Scotland. London : Methuen % Co. Ltd. P. 5. The estate had cost John Snodgrass Buchanan the sum of ¬£23,309 and 2d Scots when he purchased them on 23 January 1728.Reid, Robert of East Balgray & Caldwell (1912). Family Records. Privately published. p. 167. At the time of its construction Cunninghamhead House was held to be amongst the most elegant in the country, however by Robertson'sRobertson, George (1823).

William Aitons's Ayrshire map of 1811 shows the new mansion and the ruins of the castle behind. The Cunninghame family held these lands for several centuries before the Snodgrass family purchased them. In 1823 the Buchanans of Craigievairn held the estate; Mr. Snodgrass Buchanan was the owner in 1838. The Kerr's followed them in turn and the 1951 Statistical Account records the Misses Kerr as owning the estate. Middleton had been part of the estate. In around 1564 the name is given as 'Cunnygahamehead' and the laird also held Powkellie, now Pokelly, near Stewarton.Rollie, James (1980). The invasion of Ayrshire. A Background to the County Families. Pub. Famedram. P. 83. The caravan park and housing at the site of old Cunninghamhead House. 2007. Cunninghamhead Moss was still referred to as Kinnicumheid Moss in the 18th century; an Ayrshire legend stating that the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith, near Dalry, set the Devil to build a road across Kinnicumhead Moss in a single night.Service, John (1890). Thir Notandums, being the literary recreations of the Laird Canticarl of Mongrynen. Edinburgh : Y. J. Pentland. p. 105 This links to the original pronunciation of Cunninghame being closer to 'Kinikam'. =Sir William and Sir John Cunninghame= Of the many generations of the Cunninghame family who lived at Cunninghamehead, Sir William and his brother Sir John are recorded as pre-eminent. Sir William was present in the Great Parliament of 1560 and as a great supporter of John Knox's reforms which saw the \\"end of popery\\" in Scotland as the de facto state religion. Sir John was a member of the General Assembly in 1565 which was \\"so obnoxious to the those of the old religion at that time\\". =The Highland Hosts= William Aiton's map of 1811. In the 1640s Alasdair Mac Colla had been sent by Montrose to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Sir William Cunningham's penalty for Cunninghamhead was 1,200 merks; ¬£10,000 worth of damage already having been done.Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior. Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars.

The second 'Highland Host' episode, consisting mainly of Catholic Highlanders, was brought into Ayrshire in 1678 by the Crown Authorities to prevent the conventicles or public meetings held by the Presbyterians. At Cunninghamhead, occupied at this time by Sir William Cunninghame, Highlanders lived at 'heck and manger' for a month; what meal was in the granary they could not eat, they destroyed; they used fire to open lockfast places; and the Colonel of the troop threatened a farmer upon whom he had quartered himself that, if he did not hand over his money, he would hang him in his own barn.Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vols. 1 & 2\\\\. Pub. Ayr. Robertson relates that \\"They took free quarters; they robbed people on the high road; they knocked down and wounded those who complained; they stole, and wantonly destroyed, cattle; they subjected people to the torture of fire to discover to them where their money was hidden; they threatened to burn down houses if their demands were not at once complied with; besides free quarters they demanded money every day; they compelled even poor families to buy brandy and tobacco for them; they cut and wounded people from sheer devilment.\\" The cost of all this amounted to ¬£1,505 17s 0d. in Dreghorn and Pearceton (Sic) parish alone.Robertson, William (1905). Old Ayrshire Days. Ayr : Stephen & Pollock. Ayr. pp. 299 - 300. =The Cuninghames of Towerland= On 19 December of the same year (1600), William Cuninghame of Towerlands (near Bourtreehill) was tried on a charge of treason, his brother, Alexander, with a party of hired soldiers, had taken violent possession of the house of Cuninghamehead, in March, 1600. The King had issued written instructions for them to leave the premises however they took up arms against the King's commissioners, upon whom they fired hagbuts. Cuninghame of Towerlands was found guilty, having assisted his brother, condemned to be beheaded at the market-cross of Edinburgh; and all his lands and goods were at the same time forfeited. =The residence of the Snodgrass family= John Snodgrass acquired the estate in 1728 and in 1747 pulled down the old tower- house and constructed the mansion. Neil Snodgrass built the stables and extended or rebuilt the mansion house.Davis, Michael C. (1991). The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire. Pub. Spindrift Press, Ardrishaig, Page 228 Neil Snodgrass in 1755 had been bound as apprentice to study law, however he had his sight much injured by smallpox and was compelled to return to the country and devote himself to country pursuits. He became a great friend of Alexander, Earl of Eglinton and joined him in his pursuit of practical improvements in agriculture, such as crop rotations and fallow years. In 1773 he married Marian, daughter of James McNeil Esq. of Kilmorie. They had six children. Memorial to the Kerr family at Dreghorn & Springside Parish church Aiton complimented Mr. Snowgrass, actually Snodgrass, for his zeal in pursuing agricultural improvements in 1811, following the example set by the Earls of Eglinton and Loudoun amongst others.Aiton, William (1811). General View of the Agriculture of the County of Ayr. Pub. Glasgow. P. 61. The arms of the Snodgrass family were a figure of justice, suspending a balance; Motto, - Discite Justinian.The Lands of Cunninghamhead were valued at ¬£330 in 1640. William Kerr Esq of Cunninghamhead was buried in Dreghorn Parish churchyard. Mr and Miss Buchanan of Cunninghamhead attended the famous 1839 Eglinton Tournament in what is now Eglinton Country Park and were allotted a seat in the Grand Stand.Aikman, J & Gordon, W. (1839) An Account of the Tournament at Eglinton. Edinburgh : Hugh Paton, Carver & Gilder. p. 8. =The Kerr family= Hugh Kerr of Gatend Farm near Barrmill died on 9 August 1818 and his wife died on the 19th. Hugh had three of the sons, William, Robert and Hugh who emigrated to America and became very wealthy. William Kerr purchased Cuninghamehead, and resided here upon his retirement until his death in 1853. He was succeeded by an only child, Richard, who succeeded him.British Listed Buildings Retrieved : 2011-01-16 The Cunninghamhead Estate today =The Mansion House= The dilapidated mansion house was purchased by a developer after the death of the Kerr sisters and the renovations were nearly complete when vandals broke in and the building was destroyed by fire. The fire was in the early 1960s and as the house was too badly damaged for restoration it was demolished. =The Caravan Park= By the 1960s the estate had become significantly run down, the main entrance road impassable even by foot. From 1964, works were carried to first use the estate as a chicken farm and later as a caravan park and camping site. From 2003 onwards significant redevelopment of the caravan park and camping site was carried out to create a residential caravan park exclusively for the retired and semi-retired. =The Wigwam Bar= In the 1980s a major addition was made to Cunninghamhead Estate in the form of a large building for the Wigwam Bar. The bar served the caravan site and also held various functions for the local young farmers. At the turn of the millennium the bar was converted into two holiday letting units. =The Cottage Orn√©e= An unusual building of some antiquity stands as a substantial ruin beside the river Annick Water in the holm on the southern bank. A road through the woods connects the site to the stables and to the location of the old Mansion House. This building's remains are constructed of sizeable river boulders as foundations and well worked and carved freestone or sandstone ashlar blocks. It had a large window and door facing onto the holm, whilst the wall facing the river has largely collapsed and may have had two large windows. The door has been carefully blocked and the 'holm' facing window may have been made into an entrance. The relatively small size of the structure may suggest a social purpose, such as a type of 'Summer House' or 'Cottage orn√©e' from the early development of the estate, circa 1747. Its last occupant was a Mackay, who was a poet or writer. Charles Mackay was editor of the Glasgow Argus for four years from 1844; he returned to London and joined the Illustrated London News. Another more obscure Charles Mackay, an actor and writer, belongs to the early 18th. century.Ward, John (2006). Oral Communications. The possible 'cottage orne' beside the Annick Water showing the 'river boulders' used in its construction. The possible 'cottage orne' beside the Annick Water, showing the high quality ashlar stonework. Aiton gives the following description of a building in the Eglinton Estate which may have inspired the construction of this summer house if this is what it is, saying that \\"Near to the gardens, in a remote corner, more than half encircled by the river, a remarkably handsome cottage has been reared, and furnished, under the direction of Lady Jean Montgomery, who has contrived to unite neatness and simplicity, with great taste, in the construction of this enchanting hut. That amiable lady, spends occasionally, some part of her leisure hours, about this delightful cottage: viewing the beauties, and contemplating the operations of nature, in the foliage of leaves, blowing of flowers, and maturation of fruits; with other rational entertainments, which her enlightened mind is capable of enjoying.\\"Lady Jane Hamilton, the Earl's Aunt built or extended 'Lady Jane's Cottage' which lay beside the Lugton Water. She used this building to teach domestic economy to peasant girls. This may represent a later use of Lady Jane's cottage.Millar, A. H. (1885). The Castles & Mansions of Ayrshire. Reprinted The Grimsay Press. . p. 74 =The Gardener's Cottage= The Gardener's Cottage lies at the bottom of the road to the river. The building was of substantial size, having been extended at least once during its history. Following persistent vandalism, it was demolished in the mid-1980s. =The Stables= The old stables with the staddle stone bases. A map of the area in 1897. The main stable building, probably once also containing the estate offices, has an impressive frontage, and dates from 1820, the remainder may date from the 1740s. A number of small workers houses were located at the bottom of the courtyard, indicated by blocked up doors. At the front of the stables are three small columns to aid the mounting of horses by their riders. These Cunninghamhead mounting stones were placed by a previous owner and are not original. A small doocot or dovecot was above the entrance arch until its removal by the current owner. This was a feature of many estates, as the right to build a doocot was originally strictly limited to the major landowners, and only later were small freeholders permitted to build them; at a more recent date tenants could sometimes gain permission from their landlord to build doocots for the meat or to add a picturesque feature to their properties.Peters, J.E.C. (2003). Discovering Traditional Farm Buildings. Shire Books. . The stables had been actively marketed for a new owner from 2008, and in mid 2015 sold. Significant development plans have been submitted by the new owner. =Other estate structures= Ruins of other vernacular buildings, known as the 'Gardener's Cottage' are also to be found as total ruins in the woods off to the left hand side of the path leading down to the Annick Water from the estate. Quarry Holm, beside the old railway embankment between the estate and Annick Lodge, has the foundations of some old buildings, industrial in nature, which appear to have seen re-use before being abandoned. The railway line of 1843 cut off this site from the Annick Lodge area. The natural history of the estate Sections of the deciduous woods on the northern side of the Annick Water from the old mansion house have a rich plant diversity, indicating that they are long established and not just plantations on previously cleared land. These woodlands contain plants such as Male Shield Fern, Lady Fern, Tuberous Comfrey, Tussock Grass, Bluebells, Dog's Mercury, Opposite-Leaved Golden Saxifrage, Woodrush, Sanicle, Enchanter's Nightshade and Wood Sorrel. Agrimony is another unusual find, growing in a riparian position on the Annick Water bank, together with wild mint, just upstream of the old railway viaduct.

The younger Whitecloud encountered difficult times growing up. He was in and out of public schools as well as federal Indian schools in Albuquerque, Chilocco, and Santa Fe. He made an unsuccessful attempt at college studies at the University of New Mexico but finally settled down to serious study at the University of Redlands, where he also met and married Barbara Ibanez. Meanwhile, during his youth, he had been a farm worker, truck driver, mechanic, handyman, and boxer, among others.but his father divorced and remarried, and he was raised on the Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation near Woodruff, Wisconsin. Whitecloud studied in New Mexico and California, receiving his degree in medicine from Tulane University. Throughout his life, he worked with institutions like the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to further Indian causes. He lived in Louisiana and Texas, and was a consultant for the Texas Commission on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse for Indians at the time of his death in 1972. \\"Blue Winds Dancing\\" (1938), Whitecloud's most famous story, is about a young man's struggle to exist in ancient and modern America.

Cuninghamia. Pub. Blaeu in 1654. as being 'the hill or 'knoppe' in the field of yellow corn'. } The ruins still stand in a prominent and strongly defensible position at Auchenharvie Farm near Torranyard; the site has been much altered by quarrying. Previously the castle was known as Achin-Hervy, Awthinharye in c 1564 (Rollie 1980), Auchinbervy by Moll in 1745, Achenhay (1775 & 1807), and Auchenhowy is used by Ainslie in 1821. Auchenharvie has long been a ruin, shown as such as far back as 1604 - 08 by Timothy Pont. It was too small and the area of the mound also so restricted that its conversion into a more commodious and comfortable dwelling was not practicable. The corbels of the parapet are unusual in that they project less than usual and this links Auchenharvie with the work at Law Castle and Barr Castle.Campbell, Thorbj√∏rn (2003). Ayrshire. A Historical Guide. Edinburgh : Birlinn. . p. 122 The castle is built from whinstone with freestone corners. A good deal remains of this typical tower castle, which has been ruinous since the 1770s, with indications of the barrel roof vaulting, side tower, ornate sandstone ornamentation, etc. Some very basic consolidation works have been carried out. Uncommon orchids have been recorded as growing on the motte. It is known from the pollen record at Bloak Moss that extensive clearances took place here in the fifth or sixth centuries CE and such a site would have been of great strategic importance to these early settlers, standing out as it does, like an island above the mosses.Rackham, Oliver (1976) Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape.

Auchenharvie's most famous owner was Dr. Robert Cunninghame who was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1673 and was Physician to Charles II in Scotland, appointed shortly after the King's coronation at Scone in 1651. He was with the King's army at the defeat at Worcester in September 1651 and was made a prisoner in the Tower of London, being released after a ransom was paid. He was very wealthy and purchased back the Barony of Stevenston from the Earl of Eglinton in 1656. He died in 1676 and his son only outlived him by two years and because his daughter could not inherit, the land passed through the male line to her cousin, Robert Cunninghame.Phillips, Alec, et al.

In January 1678 Robert Cunynghame, apothecary / druggist in Edinburgh, is stated to be the heir to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Cunynghame of Auchenharvie. She was Robert's cousin-german and part of his inheritance was the Barony of Stevenston and the lands of Auchenharvie. He also owned some of the lands of Lambroughton and Chapeltoun. He married Anne Purves of Purves Hall in 1669 and had seventeen children. Despite his inheritance he later got into serious debt. The Coat of Arms of the Cunninghames of Auchenharvie The house belonged to Sir David Cunningham of Auchenharvie, an absentee courtier in England, till 1642. He planned to add additional building in 1634, beginning with a garden wall around the old tower. He had thought the house too small to accommodate his friends in 1628 during a planned royal visit, so he asked his cousin David Cunningham of Robertland to accommodate his mother so that if his friends visited they could stay at Robertland instead.National Records of Scotland: Cunningham Letters GD237/25/1-4: see NRS OPAC on-line catalogue In 1829 Aitken's map shows the castle as belonging to a Colonel Barns.Aitken, Robert (1829).

Another version of the story states that the bodies were collected together from neighbouring parishes at Darnshaw, a remote house near Bloak Moss on the old Auchenharvie to Megswell route. The bodies were then sold in Glasgow for ¬£10 each to medicals students from the university.Strawhorn, John (1985). The History of Irvine. Pub. John Donald. . P. 113.Love, Dane (1989).

Middleton near Annick Lodge had been part of the estate, passing into the hands of the Hamiltons of Bourtreehill and then passing to the Earls of Eglinton. Robert Reid Cunninghame was one of the best known member of the family at its new site, being heavily involved in coal mining in the Barony of Stevenston.Hughson, Irene (1996).

The toll road junction is still extant as farm tracks. A road used to run across the fields from here to cut across the river by a ford below Megswell farm.

A Yard in Scots is a garden. 'Torranyard' could therefore be a corruption of 'Tour Inn yard.' Local people still pronounce the name 'Torranyard' as 'TOURanyard'. 'Torran' is also a Gaelic word meaning a small hill.A History of Torrance House. Calderglen Country Park. South Lanarkshire Council. p. 3. } Torranyard is a hamlet at a crossroads on the Irvine to Glasgow 'Lochlibo Road'. It was recorded as 'Turing Yard' in 1747, 'Turnyard' in 1775, 'Tirranyard' on Thomson's 1820 map and in 1832. On the 1860 OS map it is shown as having a toll booth and an inn called 'Tour', on the opposite side of the road from the present Torranyard Inn (2007). The Montgreenan estate and hotel is nearby and the site of the old Girgenti house and surviving tower are nearby on the Cunninghamhead road. Jamieson records that the inn at Burnhouse was nicknames the 'Trap 'Em Inn', the one at Lugton was called the 'Lug 'Em Inn', that at Auchentiber the 'Cleek 'Em Inn', and finally the one at Torranyard was called the 'Turn 'Em Out.'Jamieson, Shiela (1997).

The book was made into a TV documentary in 2003. Synopsis According to the recent single-origin hypothesis, human ancestors originated in Africa, and eventually made their way out to the rest of the world. Analysis of the Y chromosome is one of the methods used in tracing the history of early humans. Thirteen genetic markers on the Y-chromosome differentiate populations of human beings. It is believed, on the basis of genetic evidence, that all human beings in existence now descend from one single man who lived in Africa about 60,000 years ago.Spencer Wells, The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey, p. 55. Random House, The earliest groups of humans are believed to find their present-day descendants among the San people, a group that is now found in western southern Africa. The San are smaller than the Bantu. They have lighter skins, more tightly curled hair, and they share the epicanthal fold with the people of Central and South East Asia. Southern and eastern Africa are believed to originally have been populated by people akin to the San. Since that early time much of their range has been taken over by the Bantu. Skeletal remains of these ancestral people are found in Paleolithic sites in Somalia and Ethiopia. There are also peoples in east Africa today who speak substantially different languages that nevertheless share the archaic characteristics of the San language, with its distinctive repertoire of click and pop sounds. These are the only languages in the entire world that use these sounds in speech. As humans migrated out of Africa, they all carried a genetic marker on the Y chromosome known as M168 (Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA)).Spencer Wells, The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey, p. 182f. Random House, The first wave of migration out of Africa stayed close to the oceans shores, tracing a band along the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean including parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and into South East Asia, down into what is now Indonesia, and eventually reaching Australia. This branch of the human family developed a new marker M130 (Haplogroup C (Y-DNA)). This first wave appears to have left dark- skinned people along its path, including isolated groups of dark-skinned people in south east Asia such as the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands (around 400 km off the west coast of Thailand), the Semang of Malaysia, and the Aeta of the Philippines.Spencer Wells, The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey, p. 75. Random House, The second wave of migration took a more northerly course, splitting somewhere in the area around what is now called Syria to sweep to interior Asia, where it split several more times in Central Asia, north of Afghanistan. The lineages that flowed into Central Asia carry M9 (Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)). Other markers were added after the migration paths went on in several different directions from Central Asia. From Central Asia, a small group migrated towards the northeast, following reindeer. These were the ancestors of Siberian groups such as the Chukchi people, a few of whom still live a nomadic lifestyle today. An even smaller group, estimated at no more than 20, crossed what is now the Bering Sea approximately 15,000 years ago during the last glacial period, and migrated into North America. They are the ancestors of Native Americans, and 800 years later, they had reached as far as South America. The African diaspora is believed to have begun some 50,000 years ago, long enough for many changes to have occurred in humans remaining in Africa. The genetic trends reported involve humans who left Africa, and their genetic histories. The diversity found outside of Africa may well have been accentuated since populations migrating to new hunting grounds would rarely have had individuals moving backwards into previously settled regions. But within Africa, isolation would have been geographically aided primarily by the Sahara Desert, leaving people in areas not separated by the desert to travel and migrate relatively freely.

Although firmly focusing on key bands from the 1960s through early 1990s, it also includes articles and reviews of contemporary and upcoming artists it deems worthy of note. Despite starting as an on-off project it became one of the UK's best selling music magazines. In September 2010 it published its 150th issue. Former owner TeamRock bought Metal Hammer, Prog and Classic Rock from Future in 2013. On 19 December 2016, TeamRock called in the administrators with the loss of 73 jobs, after experiencing financial difficulties, and suspended publication of all three titles. On 8 January 2017, Classic Rock, along with sister magazines Metal Hammer and Prog, were bought by previous owners Future Publishing for ¬£800,000, and resumed publishing. On 27 March 2018, the family of Future's UK consumer music magazines including Classic Rock re-branded and became covered under the umbrella title of Louder (also known as Louder Sound), with loudersound.com serving as the main online portal for the publications.https://www.loudersound.com/news/teamrock-rebrands-to-become- louder Key acts The magazine focuses on established bands with credentials dating back to the 1960s. Indeed, many of the artists who have appeared on its cover are deceased (Jimi Hendrix and Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy featured on early covers, as did bands with deceased members such as Queen and The Who). Acts to have appeared on the front cover three times or more to date include Queen, Guns N' Roses, Black Sabbath / Ozzy Osbourne, Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin (Jimmy Page has been on the cover on his own right at least 4 times), Metallica, Thin Lizzy, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Genesis, AC/DC, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe. More recent acts to have been on the cover include The Darkness and Velvet Revolver have been on it twice. Despite the dominating nature of acts undeniably falling into the category of classic rock, the magazine also includes heavy metal, progressive rock, blues and grunge acts. Contemporary acts Classic Rock reviews any release that even comes close to being classified as rock, including albums, DVDs, concerts and books. It includes an annual award for best new band. Acts such as Rose Hill Drive, Muse, DragonForce, The Trews, Wolfmother, The Answer and The Fluffy Jackets have all been featured. '100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever' For the 91st issue (in April 2006), the magazine presented 'The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever', which were voted for by Classic Rock staff and various people associated with rock music (including Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath fame, Lemmy of Mot√∂rhead and Francis Rossi of Status Quo). The magazine decided to let AC/DC be classed as a British act, although the band was formed in Australia. All of the band's singers (Dave Evans, Bon Scott and Brian Johnson) and guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young are of UK descent. Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin IV reached first place. Landmark issues The 100th issue contained all the regular features, but only one article, in which 100 names in rock were asked to write a piece on their nomination for a \\"rock icon\\". Contributors included Brian May, Lemmy (who nominated Tina Turner, and was then himself nominated by Ian Camfield), Ian Gillan, Gary Moore, Angus Young, Phil Collins, Sebastian Bach, Peter Frampton, Jerry Cantrell, Chris Cornell, Paul Rodgers, Chad Smith, Jack Black, Zakk Wylde and Matt Bellamy. The 200th issue contained short interviews with 200 different rock artists, including Black Sabbath, Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, Lars Ulrich of Metallica, and Thijs van Leer of Focus. Special issues Classic Rock has also published, in conjunction with Metal Hammer, special decade issues featuring 1970s (Issue I), 1980s (Issue II), and 1990s (Issue III) hard rock and metal bands, throughout 2006. In 2007, three special editions were also published with bonus DVDs for ¬£7.50. These each focussed on one genre of rock music - first blues rock (Issue I), then progressive rock (Issue II which has now become a bi monthly magazine due to the popularity), and finally, heavy metal (Issue III). A special 2007 collectors edition bookazine was produced entitled \\"High Voltage\\", featuring stories by Mick Wall and photographs by Ross Halfin on Jimmy Page, Ozzy Osbourne, and Axl Rose. In 2010, Classic Rock partnered with Road Runner Record UK to publish the Classic Rock Presents: Slash. Believed to be the first magazine publisher to top an online album chart, the pioneering ‚ÄúFan Pack‚Äù release gives fans in Europe Slash's debut solo album, one month before it receives a standard release with a full 132 page magazine about Slash. The partnership marks the first-time a major album has been released exclusively with a magazine publisher, ahead of general release.

It was officially a non-partisan and legally registered association. The organisation was banned as extremist by the governing Social Democrats in 1929.Kurt G. P. Schuster: Der rote Frontk√§mpferbund 1924‚Äì1929. Droste, D√ºsseldorf 1975, ISBN 3-7700-5083-5. The first local branches of the RFB were established in July 1924. The group's inaugural nationwide meeting was held in February 1925 in Berlin, where was elected to lead the federal committee. ('The Red Front') was the newspaper of the RFB. The greeting of () while giving a clenched fist salute gave rise to the expression ', often used among friends and foes to refer to the organization instead of its full title. The clenched fist \\"protecting the friend, fighting off the enemy\\" () was the symbol of the RFB, used on all its insignia, and its registered trademark since 1 March 1926. In May 1926, during a flag parade, activists used it as a sign of rallying to the movement and as an oath to defend the USSR. History =Formation= The KPD depended on the Proletarian Hundreds () to protect their meetings and demonstrations, but this organization was banned in 1923. This left the KPD's political activities exposed to attacks from the police and right-wing paramilitary organizations such as the and the Nazi (SA). The ninth national conference of the KPD in April 1924 decided to form a new defense organization. It was given the name , with the intent of attracting non-Communist workers as well. Then in on 11 May 1924, police fired on a demonstration; eight workers were killed and 16 seriously wounded. The KPD announced the formation of the RFB to all its local branches, and soon the first local RFB groups were formed. Most of these first RFB units were located in industrial cities, seaports, and other traditional strongholds of the working class. RFB meeting in Berlin, May 1928 =Development= Over the years the RFB engaged more and more in violent street fights with the police, the SA, and other political rivals. In 1929, the RFB participated in bloody protests after International Workers' Day was banned in Berlin during what became known as Blutmai (Bloody May). More than 30 people were shot and killed by the police. The RFB was banned and all its assets confiscated by the government. At the time of the ban, the RFB had close to 130,000 members. Many of them continued their activities illegally or in local successor organizations such as the . () Others retired from the political scene. =Under the Third Reich= After the Nazi takeover in 1933, former RFB members were among the first arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. The Nazis sought revenge on their former rivals and many of the RFB died in the Nazi prisons. Of those who survived or avoided arrest, many followed the call of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). They joined the of the International Brigades to fight against the Nationalist rebels. During World War II former Red Front fighters fought in the Soviet Red Army against Nazi Germany.Christian Baechler, L'Allemagne de Weimar: 1919-1933, Fayard, coll. ¬´ Biographies Historiques ¬ª, 2007 (]) =After the war= After World War II, former RFB members such as and were actively involved in the creation of the first police and military units of the German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany). The () and the () claimed to carry on the traditions of the RFB, while the Federal Republic of Germany in West Germany enforced the ban of 1929 and prosecuted former Red Front fighters who admitted to their RFB activities. Membership and organisation =Members= While many RFB groups were led by KPD members, most Red Front fighters were not party members. Some were even members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) or other political organizations. 98% of the RFB belonged to the working class and only 1% had received a higher education. A large part of the RFB were veterans of World War I and some had been actively involved in the November Revolution of 1918. The number of members grew constantly, peaking with close to 130,000 members at the time of the ban in 1929. * April 1925: 40,450 members in 558 local groups (49% non-party members) * June 1925: 51,630 members in 826 local groups (53% non-party members) * February 1926: 68,392 members in 1,120 local groups (55% non-party members) At the time of the ban in 1929, only 30% of the RFB were actually KPD members. 70% were non-party or members of other parties. =Sections= For its younger members (between the ages of 16 and 21), the RFB formed the (). It was renamed (RJ) () in 1925 to avoid similarities with the Nazi and to underline their goal of a united front. 40% of local RFB groups had a section of the RJ. Sailors of the Imperial German Navy had a major role in the November Revolution of 1918. To commemorate this, in May 1925 the RFB founded the (RM) () with sections in all major port cities. The RM was also considered an elite unit. Since 1925 the female members were organized in the (RFMB) (). The federal leaders were and Helene Overlach. At the 1929 ban, the RFMB had about 4,000 members. =Organizational structure= RFB Pirna The RFB's structure was a bottom to top organization.

Until 1928 there were no official RFB groups in Bavaria. Only after the end of the ban of the local group Dortmund by the Reichsgericht on April 2, 1928, RFB groups could at least formally be founded also in Bavaria. But there was a constant threat of a ban on events, especially since Bavaria had been pressing for a nationwide ban of RFB since the decision of the Reichsgericht. On April 13, 1928, after the formation of the Bund on Reich level, Jakob Boulanger founded an RFB-Gau Nordbayern with subsequent local groups in Nuremberg, W√ºrzburg, Aschaffenburg, Sulzbach, Bamberg, Hof and Bayreuth. In the summer of 1928, 14 local groups with 800 members, 350 of them in Nuremberg were registered. Activities =\\"Protection and Security\\"= standard, A large part of the RFB activities were directed at supporting the political propaganda work of the KPD, the (), and other \\"proletarian\\" organizations such as workers unions. In most cases they provided security services for the various events but also participated in active agitation. Hardened by their harsh work and living conditions, the RFB men engaged in acts of violence against the police and the political rivals who tried to disrupt rallies. Numerous events ended in mass brawls between the police and the RFB, leaving injured on both sides and in some cases dead. Arrested RFB members could depend on the for legal support and also, in case of sentencing to prison, for financial support of their families while they were unable to work. Until the RFB was banned, its rivalry with hostile organizations such as the SA, the , and the grew constantly and violence intensified. Since the strategy of the RFB was to fight and provoke, violent encounters between the RFB and SA soon became a part of everyday life. The SA achieved some strength in working-class districts, although these areas supported either the SPD or the KPD but not the \\"brown\\" Nazi Party the SA stood for. The RFB members also fought to stop landlords from evicting tenants. =\\"Social Justice and Peace\\"= Its statutes defined the RFB as anti-militarist, and therefore it opposed German re-armament. For instance, the RFB and other organizations protested against the spending of billions of Reichsmarks on \\"pocket battleships\\", and demanded the money go instead to relieve poverty. Most RFB public actions were directed against the Weimar government and its involvement with powerful German industrialists. The RFB demanded the preservation of peace and denounced plans for a new war. Most of the RFB also supported the KPD's program of Soviet-style Communism. The RFB therefore was soon considered an \\"enemy of the state\\", leading to several temporary bans of its announced parades and meetings. Other RFB events included propaganda marches in rural areas to get poor farmers and agricultural workers to join their cause.

He also served as Chief Justice of Sierra Leone. Biography Jeffcott was born in Kerry, Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and was called to the English Bar at the Inner Temple in February 1826. Jeffcott was installed as Chief Justice of the colony of Sierra Leone on 26 April 1830. He was the only judge in the colony, and much of his work arose from attempts to end the Transatlantic slave trade. Jeffcott was knighted on 1 May 1833, when he returned to England on leave. Jeffcott had been engaged to be married but the engagement was broken off by his fianc√©e or her family. Whilst in England, Jeffcott received news that a Dr Peter Hennis had made derogatory comments about Jeffcott's conduct in the affair. Jeffcott confronted Hennis, but refused to accept his explanation. On Friday, 10 May 1833 a duel with pistols was organised at Haldon racecourse near Exeter, between the two men, in the course of which Hennis was fatally wounded. A warrant was issued for Jeffcott's arrest on charges of murder, and he went into hiding. The three organisers of the duel were tried as accessories to the murder, but were acquitted, apparently due to a misunderstanding of the applicable law on the part of the jury. Following that verdict of acquittal, Jeffcott surrendered, was arraigned, and no evidence being tendered, he too was acquitted. However, he was removed from his position of Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, and his reputation was greatly damaged. On 27 May 1836, Jeffcott accepted appointment as the first judge of the new colony of South Australia, a position he had first applied for when the colony was proposed in 1834. Jeffcott never officially held the title \\"Chief Justice of South Australia\\", which was not created until 1856. Jeffcott travelled to Australia in September 1836, on the Isabella in the company of J. B. Hack and family,An Autobiography by J. B. Hack South Australian Register 22 April 1884 p.6 accessed 7 September 2011 his arrangements for passage being made secretly to defeat the efforts of creditors to recover money from him. He arrived in Hobart, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) on 1 January 1837, where he became engaged to marry his cousin Anne Kermode. He proceeded to Adelaide, South Australia, arriving there on 21 April 1837. Jeffcott became a close friend and advisor to the embattled Governor of South Australia, John Hindmarsh, and helped to smooth tensions between the Governor and his officers. As well as Judge, Jeffcott was also a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 28 December 1836 to 12 December 1837) the source of both executive and legislative power in the colony. On 13 May 1837, Jeffcott presided over the first Criminal Sessions. Seven prisoners were presented for trial before a jury, the foreman of which was Col. William Light. Apart from one other criminal case involving two Encounter Bay whalers charged with threatening to shoot another man in a quarrel between rival boats, these first Criminal Sessions appear to be the only occasion when Jeffcott actually sat as Judge. Jeffcott had lost all of his belongings when the ship in which they were being transported was wrecked, so he returned to Van Diemen's land in June 1837, and did not return to South Australia until September. Jeffcott left Adelaide for Van Diemen's Land again on 19 November 1837. Henry Jickling, the only barrister in the colony, was appointed Acting Judge in Jeffcott's absence. While waiting for a ship at Encounter Bay, Jeffcott joined an expedition to explore the Murray Mouth. He drowned on 12 December 1837 when the overloaded whaleboat in which he was a passenger overturned in rough seas. His brother William Jeffcott was also a barrister and in 1843 was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip. Jeffcott Street and Kermode Street in North Adelaide are named after Sir John Jeffcott and Robert Kermode, the brother of Jeffcott's fianc√©e. Jeffcott Chambers, barristers' chambers adjacent to the Supreme Court building in Gouger Street, Adelaide, are also named for him. See also * Judiciary of Australia Sources *R. M.

The Provisional Committee may have been the first formal institution in modern Polish history to be operated in an atmosphere of mutual trust by Polish and Jewish organizations of a broad political and socioeconomic spectrum.

This small engagement is known as the \\"southernmost land battle of the Civil War.\\" (However, see Battle of Palmito Ranch, which was south of Fort Myers and thus the Battle of Fort Myers was not the southernmost land battle of the Civil War.) Background Fort Myers had been abandoned after the Seminole Indian Wars and was reoccupied by Union soldiers in December 1863. It was the only federally occupied fort in South Florida. Union commanders planned to send horse soldiers into the area north of the Caloosahatchee River to confiscate livestock from area cattle ranches, thereby preventing shipment of beef to the Confederate Army of Tennessee in Georgia. By 1865, it was estimated that more than 4,000 head of cattle had been taken from cattle farms by the Union cavalry units from similar raids. Fort Myers was used as a refugee center for escaped slaves and also for Union sympathizers who were being persecuted by the secessionists, who were burning their homes and driving them off their farms. At one period during the Federal reoccupation, more than 400 people crowded into the fort's grounds. The fort was garrisoned primarily by the 2nd Florida Cavalry (made up mostly of refugees who had enlisted), a recently detached company of the 110th New York Volunteer Infantry and a company from the 2nd United States Colored Infantry, both from Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West. The Confederates organized a special battalion of the state militia with the sole purpose of stopping the Union raids. The battalion, commanded by Col. C. J. Munnerlyn, was made up of cattle drovers who were exempt from the Confederate Army. Among them was Capt. Francis A. Hendry. They became known as the Cattle Guard Battalion or \\"Cow Cavalry.\\" Battle In early February 1865, the Cattle Guard Battalion was deployed at Fort Meade. They were ordered to attack Fort Myers because it was learned that the fort might soon be abandoned. Three companies and one artillery piece arrived at old Fort Thomson (LaBelle, Florida) on February 19. They marched down the river and camped near Billy's Creek. The next morning, they surprised several black Union soldiers on picket duty and shot them as they tried to flee. The firing had alerted the fort, so the Confederates fired a warning shot from their cannon, followed by a messenger demanding the Union troops surrender. The fort's commanding officer, Capt. James Doyle, sent back a refusal: \\"Your demand for an unconditional surrender has been received. I respectfully decline; I have force enough to maintain my position and will fight you to the last.\\" Doyle wheeled his own two cannons outside the fort. A battle began with the black Union soldiers firing the artillery and the white Union cavalrymen firing their carbines. Throughout the day, both sides continued sporadic firing, which finally ceased at dark. One black Federal soldier had been killed in the skirmishing. The next morning, the Cattle Guard Battalion returned to Fort Meade. Even though the attack had been repelled, Fort Myers was abandoned by its garrison in early March.

Dixon starred as a running back for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, from to .http://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?player_id=dixongeo001 While Dixon played in only 76 games during his injury-shortened, seven-year career, all with the Alouettes, he is remembered as one of their finest players. Dixon's jersey #28 is one of seven retired by the Alouettes, and he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1974. In 2006, Dixon was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL's Top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. After his playing career ended, Dixon was the head coach of the Loyola College Warriors (now Concordia Stingers) Canadian college football team in the late 1960s-early 1970s.  College and NFL career  Dixon was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1934, and was a graduate of the nearby University of Bridgeport, where he starred as a running back for the Purple Knights. Following graduation, Dixon was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 9th round (97th pick) of the 1959 NFL Draft. His impressive 95 yard kickoff return for a touchdown on August 23, 1959, against the San Francisco 49ers in an exhibition game, was not enough to keep rookie head coach Vince Lombardi from cutting him. Dixon missed out on a chance to be part of one of the NFL's great dynasties, becoming a Canadian Football Hall of Fame member instead.  CFL career  With Verdun Shamcats offensive lineman, and later Alouettes General Manager, Bob Geary blocking for him, Dixon amassed 5,615 yards on 896 carries, for an average of 6.3 yards a carry. He scored 59 touchdowns, 42 by rushing. His best day came on September 5, 1960, when he scored 4 touchdowns against the Ottawa Rough Riders. Dixon rushed for 100 yards in a game 24 times in his career. Although the Alouettes did not have a winning season during Dixon's time with the club, the Alouettes made the playoffs 5 of the 7 years, losing in the Eastern Division semi-finals in 4 of those years. Dixon will also forever be in the Alouettes, and CFL, record book for his 109-yard longest run from scrimmage, against the Ottawa Rough Riders, on September 2, 1963. He also set the Larks one game rushing record that day, with 235 yards. Dixon's best season was in , when he rushed for 1,520 yards, was named an Eastern Conference and CFL All-Star and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. The following, 1963 CFL season was also a good one, with Dixon amassing 1,270 yards rushing and equalling his All-Star honours of the previous year. Dixon's great accomplishments have not gone unremembered. His uniform number, 28, has been retired by the Alouettes, and he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on May 6, 1974. In November 2006, Dixon was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL's top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN.  Later life and death  After his playing career ended, Dixon coached the Loyola College Warriors, of Montreal, to great and unexpected success. The following quote is taken from the Concordia University 2006 Sports Hall of Fame induction (Loyola merged with Sir George Williams University to create Concordia in 1974:) Dixon died on August 6, 1990, in Montreal, at the age of 56.

Essentially a revamp of Kaiser's Henry J compact, the Kaiser Darrin was one of its designer's final achievements and was noted for being the first American car equipped with a fiberglass body and doors that slid on tracks into the front fender wells. The car was named both for Henry J. Kaiser, head of Kaiser Motors, and Darrin. The Darrin was conceived as part of a movement in Detroit to compete head-to-head with European roadsters being imported to and sold in the United States in the post‚ÄìWorld War II period. Among other products developed were the Ford Thunderbird in its initial two-seat form and Chevrolet Corvette. While the Darrin was designed attractively, it was also underpowered and, while a good performer overall, did not measure up to foreign vehicles such as the Nash- Healey or Triumph TR2. The Darrin's high price tag, lack of consumer confidence in Kaiser's viability and practical challenges with the car's design resulted in low sales, though sports cars at the time were generally not fast sellers. Only 435 production Darrins and six prototypes were built. Crumbling corporate finances, pending loss of assembly facilities and a freak snowstorm that reportedly ruined 50 of the cars all conspired to terminate the program. Darrin bought those 50 vehicles and whatever others Kaiser had left in storage and sold those from his Hollywood, California showroom. Many of the cars' engines were retrofitted with superchargers and multiple carburation to improve performance. Six were re-engined with Cadillac Eldorado V-8 units; one of these was reportedly raced. Background =Kaiser= Henry J. Kaiser By the end of his life, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser had built a personal empire which included more than 100 various companies that ranged from construction and manufacturing to health care. He had begun with a cement business in Vancouver, British Columbia. A contract to build roads in Cuba in 1927 was followed with work on the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams. In 1939, he entered the shipbuilding industry. Even though he had never built a ship before then, by 1943 he had more than 300,000 employees in seven shipyards and ultimately built 1,490 ships during World War II. An exceptional organizer and with a penchant for lateral thinking, Kaiser tended to bulldoze his way through a problem. In areas that lacked infrastructure to support his work force, Kaiser and his son Edgar built entire cities within months. If there was a shortage of steel, he built a foundry or found a way to substitute aluminum. All that Kaiser tended to lack, according to writer Aaron Severson, was a sense of his own limitations. Kaiser had begun to consider entering the automobile business in 1942, when the United States government halted production of civilian vehicles to focus on military ones due to the country's entry into World War II. With an eye toward postwar needs, Kaiser assembled a team of \\"idea men\\" to conceive a compact, lightweight car that the average working man could afford. By 1945, efforts had reached the prototype stage with the K-85, not a compact car but one with several advanced features, which included front wheel drive, unibody construction and a combination of torsion-bar springs and a torsion- beam rear axle called \\"Torsionetic Suspension.\\" In partnership with automotive executive Joseph W. Frazer, Kaiser formed Kaiser-Frazer Corporation on July 25, 1945. Late that year, Kaiser-Frazer leased the Ford factory complex in Willow Run, near Detroit, Michigan as its manufacturing base.Severson, \\"Kaisers Never Retrench: The History of Kaiser-Frazer, Part 1\\" Building new cars soon proved more problematical than designing them. While postwar demand for new cars meant robust sales, an ongoing shortage of capital at Kaiser- Frazer led to a split between its two founders. Kaiser wanted to expand production; Frazer wanted to retrench and economize, especially with the view that as the Big Three‚ÄîFord, Chrysler and General Motors‚Äîbrought out newly designed cars, Kaiser-Frazer sales would drop. (Immediately after World War II, the Big Three had made do with cars made essentially along prewar designs in a rush to get new vehicles to market.) In early 1949, Frazer stepped down as president of Kaiser-Frazer. He was replaced by Kaiser's son Edgar and the company renamed Kaiser Motors. Frazer's concerns proved accurate. Sales slumped in 1949. Henry and Edgar Kaiser contemplated liquidation but decided against it in the hope that a new Kaiser for 1951, the Henry J, would help turn sales around.Severson, \\"Kaisers Never Retrench: The History of Kaiser- Frazer, Part 2\\" =Darrin= American designer Howard \\"Dutch\\" Darrin began coach building in Paris in partnership with fellow American designer Thomas L. Hibbard under the name Hibbard & Darrin in 1923. While they became noted over the following years for the innovatively-styled bodies they designed for many of Europe's most prestigious chassis, the Great Depression and resultant loss of customers hit Hibbard & Darrin hard. The partnership ended in 1931 when Hibbard accepted a position in General Motors's design department under Harley Earl. While Darrin remained in France initially and formed the coach building firm of Fernandez & Darrin with a wealthy South American banker, he returned to the United States in 1937. He set up his own coachworks on Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood and worked with Packard on some of the most attractive models built by that company in the 1930s and 40s. These included the Packard 120 and Packard Clipper.Donnelley One of his trademarks became a sweeping fender line which descended gently along the side of the car until it reached a \\"dip\\" at the head of the rear fender.McMullen 1941 Packard Clipper Darrin Convertible Darrin began work with Kaiser-Frazer as a freelance consultant at the end of World War II, after a plan to manufacture and sell an advanced automobile of his own design failed to materialize due to an immediate postwar shortage of raw materials. Investment banker Charles Schwartz, a friend of Darrin's who had helped arrange the financing for his plan, introduced him to Joseph Frazer. Frazer commissioned Darrin to design a car that he planned to market through the Graham-Paige automotive firm. Once Kaiser-Frazer had been incorporated, Darrin's design became the first 1947 Frazer. By 1946, Darrin had been contracted as a Kaiser-Frazer consultant.Until Kaiser and Frazer parted ways, Kaiser and Frazer automobiles were offered as two separate brands under the Kaiser-Frazer banner. Darrin's relationship with the company and Kaiser was stormy. Darrin's designs were generally discarded for more conventional, less attractive designs. He resigned from Kaiser-Frazer in 1946 after its \\"orange juicers,\\" as he called the company's designers, had altered his design for the 1946 K-F sedan. Although Henry and Edgar Kaiser had gotten along with Darrin personally and had hired him based on his reputation in automotive circles, neither was sorry to see him go. Darrin could be mercurial, temperamental and cantankerous. He left with the impression that Kaiser-Frazer had been excluding him, especially as Joseph Frazer's influence in the company had waned. However, when Frazer asked Darrin to return two years later to work on the 1951 Kaiser, Darrin accepted. When it chose a more staid design for its Henry J compact than the one he had provided, Darrin once again resigned.\\"How Stuff Works\\" Reclothing the Henry J The Henry J had been its namesake's pet project, the result of both Kaiser and Frazer's desire to provide an affordable car to the average working man.Roth It was also the basis for a $44 million loan from the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1948, with the condition that the car was to go to market no later than the summer of 1950. Its wheelbase, at , had been sectioned from the company's 1951 sedan which, while conventional, had proved a sound design. Moreover, the 1951 sedan had a low center of gravity and, with an uncommonly good ride, rivaled the Hudson step-down models as among the best-handling cars of its class. Contemporary testers of the Henry J such as Tom McCahill of Mechanix Illustrated and Floyd Clymer of Popular Mechanics pointed out the car's poor quality of assembly but praised the Henry J's performance. Automotive writer Aaron Severson, in his article \\"Dressed to Kill: The 1954 Kaiser Darrin,\\" called the Henry J's roadability an \\"agreeable blend of ride comfort and maneuverability\\" and its engine \\"sprightly, if not particularly fast.\\" 1951 Kaiser Henry J Darrin felt that the Henry J deserved better than the boxy design with which it had been outfitted and set out to prove it. Using his own funds and without notifying Kaiser, Darrin produced a 2-seat roadster design. After he had completed a clay model in the first half of 1952, Darrin contacted Bill Tritt, who had pioneered the use of glass- reinforced plastic (GRP, commonly known as fiberglass) in sports car bodies to have him produce a prototype. This body was shipped to Darrin's design shop in Santa Monica, California, and mated to a Henry J chassis. Once the prototype was finished, Darrin invited Kaiser to see the car. Kaiser, predictably, became upset at the sight of the new car. He roared, \\"We are not in the business of selling sports cars,\\" he chastised Darrin for proceeding with the project without his knowledge.Kaiser had in fact already been approached by designer Brooks Stevens in 1951 to build a two-seat roadster, based on the Anglo-American Nash-Healey, called the Excaliber J. Kaiser had passed. (Severson, \\"Dressed to Kill\\") Darrin answered that the car had not been built on company time and that he had funded it himself. \\"Furthermore,\\" he added, \\"if you don't build the car under the Kaiser banner, I'll build it myself.\\" At this point, Kaiser's new, younger wife, who had accompanied him to the shop, told her husband, \\"This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I don't see why you aren't in the business of building sports cars. I don't think there will be many automobile companies that won't go into the sports car business after seeing this car.\\" Those words changed Kaiser's mind. By the end of the viewing, he had not only embraced the building of the car but also green-lighted development of a four-door version. Months later, Kaiser showed his appreciation by having the new sports car named the Kaiser Darrin. As it turned out, there was actually a rush in progress among American car manufacturers to produce a two-seat roadster that would rival British imports. Ford Motor Company was developing the initial version of its Thunderbird and General Motors was working on the Chevrolet Corvette. Darrin's work predated both these projects.Owen Design Driver's side view of Kaiser Darrin. Note padded dashboard and sliding entry door. Along with Darrin's trademark fender line, the Kaiser Darrin had entry doors that, instead of being hinged to open outward, slid on tracks into the front fender wells behind the front wheels. Fueled by Darrin's dislike for conventional doors, the designer had taken out a patent on the sliding auto door concept in 1946. To keep the door assembly as simple as possible, no side windows were built into them. The car was equipped with a three-position Landau top, which was also considered novel, and the design on the whole considered by industry critics and writers as beautifully proportioned. The only flaw was considered the car's front grille. High and shell-shaped, it looked as though the automobile \\"wanted to give you a kiss,\\" as one writer commented. As with the prototype, the body for the production Kaiser Darrin was made of fiberglass. More resilient than aluminum, fiberglass did not rot or corrode, was lightweight and more pliable than steel to mold into shape. The molds were far less expensive than the tooling needed to bend and shape steel. This could theoretically make a fiberglass-bodied car economical for a small private manufacturer such as Kaiser to produce. The body was molded in two sections, minus deck lid, doors and hood. Underneath, the frame rails of the Henry J were modified to allow for a lower ride height, the steering ratio altered and the spring and damping rates changed to match the lighter body. The car was offered initially in four colors‚ÄîChampagne Lacquer (white), Red Sail Lacquer, Yellow Satin Lacquer, and Pine Tint Lacquer (green)‚Äîwith lacquer paints specified because fiberglass could not withstand the temperatures needed to bake enamel onto it. Tritt's company, Glasspar, was commissioned to produce bodies for the production model. However, Glasspar produced only a handful of these. The remaining 435 were produced in-house by Kaiser. Glasspar did continue to produce the deck lids (truck, top compartment, and engine hood) and doors. Several changes were necessitated to put the car into production. Only two of these angered the designer but were deemed necessary to meet vehicle regulations in several states‚Äîraising the headlights four inches and adding turn signals below them. Other alterations included separate lids for the trunk and top well instead of the one-piece lid on the prototype, a one-piece windshield without a \\"sweetheart dip\\" in place of a split windshield, an amended interior and a dashboard display with the instruments clustered ahead of the steering wheel instead of spread across the panel. Interior features included color-keyed vinyl bucket seats, available in red, white, black, or Pine Tint (green), and a carpeted floor.Some sources claim that leather seats were available by special order (Severson, \\"Dressed to Kill\\")Flory, 584, 589 Seat belts, which were not widely available on American cars at this time, were listed as an option, however, there were no attachment points built into the frame or body. Production =Delays= Rear view of Kaiser Darrin The prototype Darrin was unveiled to the public in September 1952 (two months before General Motors debuted the Corvette) at the Los Angeles Motorama, an event founded by Hot Rod and Motor Trend publisher Robert E. Petersen in 1950 to cater to hot rod and custom car enthusiasts. Public and media response to the Darrin was positive, with the roadster dubbed \\"the sports car that everyone has been waiting for.\\" At the 1953 New York Auto Show, Kaiser Motors announced that the Darrin would be available by that autumn. However, production models did not reach showrooms until January 1954, after the Corvette had entered the market.Zenlea Among the factors that caused delay was the lack of an adequate powerplant. While the prototype had used a standard Henry J drivetrain, even Kaiser himself realized that a sports car needed more power than that engine could offer. Kaiser engineers had developed an overhead-valve V8 engine but the company had lacked the money to build it. Kaiser had then turned to Oldsmobile but the price for its 303-cubic-inch Rocket V8 became prohibitive when Olds raised its price halfway through negotiations. For the Darrin, Kaiser engineers modified a Henry J engine, giving it a high compression aluminum head, a hotter camshaft and a three- carburetor set-up. These changes added 25 horsepower to the output but increased valve and piston damage and affected drivability negatively. In March 1953, Kaiser merged with Willys-Overland in 1953 to form Willys Motors Incorporated. Kaiser subsequently moved production to the Willys plant in Toledo, Ohio. The merger also offered an alternative engine choice for the Darrin. When the modified Kaiser J engine did not prove practical, Kaiser engineers decided to try the F-head six-cylinder Willys Hurricane. The Hurricane offered only six horsepower more than the Kaiser engine but was built more strongly and seemed to hold up better to the increased forces of supercharging. Unfortunately, just as the engine issue was being resolved, a labor strike shut down the Willow Run plant where the engine was made. Pilot production on the Darrin did not commence until August 1953. Full production finally began that December. =Slow Sales and Design Flaws= When the car finally hit the market, its price, at $3668, was higher than the Cadillac 62 or Lincoln Capri luxury cars but came equipped with tachometer, electric windshield wipers, tinted windshield, windwings and whitewall tires. Because of the car's price and lack of performance, sales were low. The Darrin's unexceptional road performance did not help. A Willys Hurricane-6 produced 90 bhp, which allowed the car to reach a top speed of just and go from 0 to in around 15 seconds. While this was faster than the inexpensive MG TF, it was slower than the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider and Triumph TR2. Compared to the larger-engined Corvette, Nash-Healey and Jaguar XK120, the Darrin was completely outclassed. Also, while the Darrin possessed quick steering, it understeered considerably with brisk cornering and was not as agile overall as its European rivals. The ride, however, was comfortable for a sports car. Its brakes, borrowed from the much heavier Kaiser Manhattan, were excellent and the car proved easy to drive. Problems with the design also became apparent as the Darrin entered the market, especially regarding its sliding doors. While interior space was adequate, entering or exiting through the narrow door openings could prove awkward. Doors on early production vehicles tended to jam. A switch to nylon roller bushings (retrofitted to early cars) corrected the problem to some extent but owners still had to keep door tracks free of dirt, mud or debris. Also, the folding top and side curtains leaked and the heater proved inadequate. While these last two problems plagued sports cars of the time in general, they also limited the Darrin's marketability. Kaiser dealers were reluctant to order them. =End of Production= Kaiser's hope that the Darrin would entice dealers to order more of the company's standard models did not prove true. By early 1954, many Kaiser franchises had either switched to other auto makers or had gone out of business. Few ordered any Darrins at all. Since consumer confidence in Kaiser's future had become low, buyers generally did not want to purchase any Kaiser, let alone one that, while attractive, also seemed impractical and was priced as a luxury item. A lack of orders prompted Kaiser in July to reduce the Darrin's wholesale price by about five percent. Later that month, the company's general sales manager, Roy Abernethy, offered substantial dealer incentives on all Kaisers. These included a $700 trade-in allowance on any Darrin.Abernethy would later to become president of American Motors Corporation (AMC) (Severson, \\"Dressed to Kill\\") While Kaiser had set a goal of selling 1,000 Darrins a year, production had not reached half that number and the factory where the Darrin was manufactured was backlogged with unsold cars. The lease on that plant, located in Jackson, Michigan, was about to expire.The warehouse building of the Jackson plant had actually been sold to Walker Manufacturing in 1953 (Severson, \\"Dressed to Kill\\") Either a renewed lease on that facility or the establishment of a new assembly line elsewhere would be needed if Darrin production was to continue past the end of 1954. Given this and the fact that neither dealer orders nor sales showed any signs of improving, Kaiser stopped production in August 1954. Another factor in the Darrin's demise was a freak snowstorm that hit Toledo in the winter of 1953-54. Fifty Darrins had been stored in the yard of the Kaiser-Willys plant there remained buried in snow for several months. When they were finally dug out, their fiberglass bodies were deemed too deteriorated to sell as new and Kaiser ordered them scrapped. At this point, Darrin intervened, demanding that the company not scrap his creation. Since Darrin had retained rights to the car's design, which Kaiser had built under license, Kaiser offered him the cars at a token price as an appeasement. Darrin bought them and had them shipped to Santa Monica.Severson, \\"Dressed to Kill\\" Aftermath A 1954 Kaiser Darrin on display at the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum As Kaiser exited the US consumer car market in 1955 it still had a number of Darrins in storage in its remaining facilities. Howard Darrin collected as many of them as he could and, along with the 50 write-offs that he had brought from the Toledo plant, offered them for sale from his Hollywood showroom. He retrofitted the engines of several cars with McCulloch superchargers and multiple carburetors to improve their performance. He replaced the powerplants of six cars with V-8 engines, rated at 305 bhp, used by General Motors for its Cadillac Eldorado. Darrin sold the latter as Kaiser-Darrin Specials at $4350 each.Schorr, 15 Both of these conversions improved the Darrin's performance dramatically. Tests of the supercharged factory prototype made at Kaiser showed that the supercharged cars could go from zero to in around 10 seconds and had a top speed of over . The Cadillac-engined Darrin Specials, according to automotive author Martyn L. Schorr, \\"combined the best attributes of a highly stylized sporty car with those of a hot rod.\\" With a top speed of more than , some of them competed in SCCA events in the hands of owners like Laura Maxine Elmer (later to become Briggs Cunningham‚Äôs second wife), race driver Lance Reventlow and Ray Sinatra (cousin of Frank Sinatra). By 1957, the last of the roadsters had been sold. Darrin also tried to interest the Studebaker-Packard Corporation in the four- door version suggested when he had unveiled the prototype Kaiser Darrin to Henry J. Kaiser. A single hardtop mock-up with an extended wheelbase, front and rear sliding doors and a redesigned front end was built. Studebaker- Packard, itself ailing financially, passed on the design. The whereabouts of Darrin's mock-up is unknown. Analysis Severson maintains that, while conventional wisdom would consider the Kaiser Darrin a marketing failure, it really did not do that badly when compared to its competition in the sports car field. The Nash-Healey, which was also expensive, sold only around 500 vehicles between 1951 and 1954. Allard production was never more than 150 or so a year. Annual sales of fiberglass kit cars such as the Glasspar G2 and Woodill Woodfire were measured in the dozens. Severson adds that while the Corvette was produced in far greater numbers than either the Kaiser Darrin or its foreign rivals, Chevrolet‚Äôs greater marketing resources and stronger dealer network did not ensure brisk sales. Hundreds of unsold Corvettes remained at the end of 1954. The model did not become profitable for General Motors, Severson says, until it was equipped with a V8 engine and roll-up windows. With all this in mind, Severson concludes, the fact that Kaiser sold as many Darrins as it did was somewhat remarkable. Even if Kaiser Motors had been stronger financially or more established in the marketplace, Severson says, the Darrin might not have sold in large numbers. Practical considerations such as a lower price, better performance and effective weatherproofing might have led to higher sales. Even so, Severson continues, the company would likely not have made much money on the car. Had it arrived in showrooms early enough to provide a greater promotional value to Kaiser Motors as a whole, Severson says, this fact might not have proved so crucial. By the time production Darrins arrived, Severson suggests, \\"Kaiser didn‚Äôt need a traffic builder, it needed a miracle.\\" Notes References Sources *Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, \\"Kaiser-Darrin,\\" How Stuff Works.

It is the corollary to Wolff's law, which applies to osseous tissue. It is a physiological principle stating that soft tissue heal according to the manner in which they are mechanically stressed.Ellenbecker, Todd, \\"Effective Functional Progressions in Sport Rehabilitation\\", Human Kinetics 2009, It is also an application of the Mechanostat model of Harold Frost which was originally developed to describe the adaptational response of bones; however ‚Äì as outlined by Harold Frost himself ‚Äì it also applies to fibrous collagenous connective tissues, such as ligaments, tendons and fascia.Frost, Harold \\"New targets for fascial, ligament and tendon research: A perspective from the Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology\\" J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2003; 3(3):201‚Äì209Frost, Harold \\"The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972 The \\"stretch-hypertrophy rule\\" of that model states: \\"Intermittent stretch causes collagenous tissues to hypertrophy until the resulting increase in strength reduces elongation in tension to some minimum level\\".Frost, Harold \\"The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972, page 176 Similar to the behavior of bony tissues this adaptational response occurs only if the mechanical strain exceeds a certain threshold value. Harold Frost proposed that for dense collagenous connective tissues the related threshold values are around 23 Newton/mm2 or 4% strain elongation.Frost, Harold \\"Does the anterior cruciate have a modeling threshold? A case for the affirmative\\". J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2001; 2(2):131‚Äì136 Origin The term Davis's law is named after Henry Gassett Davis, an American orthopedic surgeon known for his work in developing traction methods. Its earliest known appearance is in John Joseph Nutt's 1913 book Diseases and Deformities of the Foot, where Nutt outlines the law by quoting a passage from Davis's 1867 book, Conservative Surgery: :\\"Ligaments, or any soft tissue, when put under even a moderate degree of tension, if that tension is unremitting, will elongate by the addition of new material; on the contrary, when ligaments, or rather soft tissues, remain uninterruptedly in a loose or lax state, they will gradually shorten, as the effete material is removed, until they come to maintain the same relation to the bony structures with which they are united that they did before their shortening. Nature never wastes her time and material in maintaining a muscle or ligament at its original length when the distance between their points of origin and insertion is for any considerable time, without interruption, shortened.\\" Detailed description of Davis's law Davis's writing on the subject exposes a long chain of competing theories on the subject of soft tissue contracture and the causes of scoliosis. Davis's comments in Conservative Surgery were in the form of a sharp rebuke of lectures published by Louis Bauer of the Brooklyn Medical and Surgical Institute in 1862. In his writing, Bauer averred that \\"a contraction of ligaments is a physiological impossibility\\". Bauer sided with work published in 1851 by Julius Konrad Werner, director of the Orthopedic Institute of Konigsberg, Prussia; Bauer and Werner, in turn, were contradicting research published by Jacques Mathieu Delpech in 1823. Soft tissue examples Tendons are soft tissue structures that respond to changes in mechanical loading. Bulk mechanical properties, such as modulus, failure strain, and ultimate tensile strength, decrease over long periods of disuse as a result of micro-structural changes on the collagen fiber level. In micro-gravity simulations, human test subjects can experience gastrocnemius tendon strength loss of up to 58% over a 90-day period. Test subjects who were allowed to engage in resistance training displayed a smaller magnitude of tendon strength loss in the same micro- gravity environment, but modulus strength decrease was still significant. Conversely, tendons that have lost their original strength due to extended periods of inactivity can regain most of their mechanical properties through gradual re-loading of the tendon, due to the tendon's response to mechanical loading. Biological signaling events initiate re-growth at the site, while mechanical stimuli further promote rebuilding. This 6-8 week process results in an increase of the tendon's mechanical properties until it recovers its original strength. However, excessive loading during the recovery process may lead to material failure, i.e. partial tears or complete rupture. Additionally, studies show that tendons have a maximum modulus of approximately 800 MPa; thus, any additional loading will not result in a significant increase in modulus strength. These results may change current physical therapy practices, since aggressive training of the tendon does not strengthen the structure beyond its baseline mechanical properties; therefore, patients are still as susceptible to tendon overuse and injuries.

It also features debates, news and sports reports. All Primeira Liga matches are exclusively broadcast by Sport TV, with the exception of Benfica home matches, which are broadcast on the club's channel, BTV. History On 16 September 2005, seven years after the opening of the first channel, Sport TV launched a second channel, SportTV 2. It regularly broadcasts alternative sports such as mountaineering, cycling and radical sports. The channel was available only through ZON TV Funtastic Life package, but the model did not work. They relaunched the channel as a premium channel, also available on Cabovis√£o and Portugal Telecom's MEO. This was followed in June 2008 by SportTV 3. Sport TV shown UEFA Euro 2008 in HD, through ZON TV. On January 22, 2010, the thematic golf channel SPORT.TV Golfe and its HD simulcast, SPORT.TV Golfe HD were launched. On August 13, 2010, they launched SPORT.TV Liga Inglesa, a HD channel dedicated to the Premier League, broadcasting 380 games and 400 highlights per season, made by the Premier League (also broadcasting on other countries). On January 7, 2011, SPORT.TV1, SPORT.TV2 and SPORT.TV3 started to broadcast in 16:9. On August 13, 2011, all of the SportTV main channels started to broadcast in HD and it was launched a new channel, SPORT.TV4, that also is available in HD. At the same time, the Sport TV HD channel ended its two-year run. On June 5, 2013, Sport TV stopped broadcasting in the United States. On August 1, 2013, SPORT TV launched a new channel, SPORT.TV Live, replacing SPORT.TV4. On August 14, 2014, SPORT.TV Live was renamed to SPORT.TV4 again (there's also SPORT.TV4 HD). SPORT.TV Golfe was renamed to SPORT.TV5, which is also available in HD.

On September 2007, Sport TV sent a cease and desist to a Portuguese live TV streaming website tvtuga.com because the latter was providing links to streams of UEFA Champions League matches that only SPORT TV had the rights to broadcast in Portugal. This has caused great public concern with regard to the monopoly abuse status of the SPORT TV channels.http://barvelho.blogspot.pt/2007/09/questo-tvtuga.html On 17 January 2011, Sport TV was criticized by Benfica after a match against Acad√©mica. Benfica's director of communications at the time, Jo√£o Gabriel, accused the channel commentators of bias against the club.

Torii Kiyonobu I (; ‚Äì 22 August 1729) was a Japanese painter and printmaker in the ukiyo-e style, who is renowned for his work on kabuki signboards and related materials. Along with his father Torii Kiyomoto, he is said to have been one of the founders of the Torii school of painting. Known in childhood as Sh≈çbei, young Kiyonobu was the second son of the established Osaka kabuki actor and painter Torii Kiyomoto, born in 1664. He moved, with his father, to Edo (modern Tokyo) when he was twenty-four, and emerged there as a major artist with a unique style. Kiyonobu's work is regarded as being highly influenced by that of Hishikawa Moronobu (d. 1694), the father of ukiyo-e; Kiyonobu would also have been well- versed, as most major artists were at the time, in the styles of the Kan≈ç and Tosa schools. Kiyonobu focused almost exclusively on producing billboards and other promotional material for Edo's kabuki theaters; the relationship between the theaters and the Torii school was a strong and important one, and one that continues today. Guided by the need to attract attention, Kiyonobu's style tended towards bold, colorful exuberance. In addition to a distinctive use of color, details, and various other aesthetic elements, the Torii style is especially distinguished by the use of thick, bold line. By 1700, Kiyonobu was a fully established and accomplished artist. His works were praised by contemporary writers, and were often even placed in Shint≈ç shrines as votive offerings, a fact which indicates something of the artistic quality or emotional impact of his depictions of Kabuki actors. By the time of his death in 1729, Kiyonobu had not only painted a great number of signboards and the like, but had also produced illustrations for woodblock printed books, depicting kabuki dramas, and had issued individual prints as well. As is the case with most Torii school artists, Kiyonobu's dates are not known for sure, and the relationships between the various Torii artists are similarly unclear. The styles of Kiyonobu's disciples and relatives are very similar, and most scholars entertain the possibility that Kiyonobu II or Kiyomasu I were the same man as the subject of this article, Kiyonobu I, or as one another. Very few, if any, paintings created by the Torii school are known definitely to have been painted by any one particular artist. See also *Torii Kiyonobu II ‚Äì Kiyonobu's successor as head of the Torii school, and likely his son *Torii Kiyomasu ‚Äì a contemporary of Kiyonobu, in a somewhat different style.

Above bold lines stand for interacting Green functions, non-bold lines stand for non-interaction Green function, and dashed lines stand for two-body interactions. The random phase approximation (RPA) is an approximation method in condensed matter physics and in nuclear physics. It was first introduced by David Bohm and David Pines as an important result in a series of seminal papers of 1952 and 1953. For decades physicists had been trying to incorporate the effect of microscopic quantum mechanical interactions between electrons in the theory of matter. Bohm and Pines' RPA accounts for the weak screened Coulomb interaction and is commonly used for describing the dynamic linear electronic response of electron systems. In the RPA, electrons are assumed to respond only to the total electric potential V(r) which is the sum of the external perturbing potential Vext(r) and a screening potential Vsc(r). The external perturbing potential is assumed to oscillate at a single frequency œâ, so that the model yields via a self-consistent field (SCF) method a dynamic dielectric function denoted by ŒµRPA(k, œâ). The contribution to the dielectric function from the total electric potential is assumed to average out, so that only the potential at wave vector k contributes. This is what is meant by the random phase approximation. The resulting dielectric function, also called the Lindhard dielectric function,N. W. Ashcroft and N. D. Mermin, Solid State Physics (Thomson Learning, Toronto, 1976) correctly predicts a number of properties of the electron gas, including plasmons.G. D. Mahan, Many-Particle Physics, 2nd ed. (Plenum Press, New York, 1990) The RPA was criticized in the late 1950s for overcounting the degrees of freedom and the call for justification led to intense work among theoretical physicists. In a seminal paper Murray Gell-Mann and Keith Brueckner showed that the RPA can be derived from a summation of leading-order chain Feynman diagrams in a dense electron gas. The consistency in these results became an important justification and motivated a very strong growth in theoretical physics in the late 50s and 60s.

Migration to Abyssinia When the Muslims were harassed in Mecca, several of them migrated to Abyssinia. Ja'far joined the second flight in 616.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 146. There they obtained the protection of the Negus, Ashama ibn Abjar, and could worship God unhindered.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 148, 150. Ja'far and Asma lived in Abyssinia for about twelve years. Three sons were born to them there: Abdullah, Muhammad and Awn. =The Quraysh Delegation= The Quraysh, suspicious of their motives for leaving Arabia, sent Abdullah ibn Abi Rabiah and 'Amr ibn al-'As to negotiate with the Negus to bring the emigrants back to Mecca. They gave presents of leather-goods to the Negus and his officials and gave him a bad report of the Muslims.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 150-151. The Negus replied that he had promised protection to the Muslims and therefore could not hand them over without hearing their side of the story. When the Muslims were called to answer to the Negus, Ja‚Äôfar was their spokesman.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 151. The Negus asked them what was the religion for which they had forsaken their people, without entering into his religion or any other. Ja'far replied: \\"We were an uncivilised people. God sent us an apostle who commanded us to speak the truth, be faithful to our engagements, mindful of the ties of kinship and kindly hospitality, and to refrain from crimes and bloodshed. He forbade us to commit abominations and to speak lies, and to devour the property of orphans, to vilify chaste women. He commanded us to worship God alone and not to associate anything with Him, and he gave us orders about prayer, alms and fasting [enumerating the commands of Islam]. So we believed in him and what he brought to us from Allah, and we follow what he asked us to do and we avoid what he forbade us to do.\\"Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 151-152. The Negus asked if Ja'far had with him anything that Muhammad had received from God. Ja'far recited for him the first portion of Surah Maryam in the Quran, which narrates the story of Isa (Jesus) and his mother Maryam (Mary). On hearing these words, \\"the Negus wept until his beard was wet and the bishops wept until their scrolls were wet.\\" The Negus said that he would never harm the Muslims.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 152. The two Quraysh delegates alleged that the Muslims called Jesus a created being, so the Negus asked Ja'far what he thought of Jesus. Ja'far answered: \\"Our prophet says he is God's slave, apostle, spirit and word, which he cast into Mary the blessed virgin.\\" At this the Negus returned the gifts of the Quraysh, calling them \\"bribes,\\" and \\"they left his presence crestfallen.\\" The Muslims continued to live with the Negus \\"comfortably in the best security\\".Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 152-153. =Overseas Preaching= It is said that Ja'far left Abyssinia to preach in other countries. He accompanied Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and others in their mission to the Chittagong-Manipur-Tibet-Khotan-China region. The Muslims of the oasis-city of Khotan (in the Xinjiang Province, south of the Taklamakan Desert, west of Tibet) trace their origin to Ja'far. Thereafter Ja'far returned to Abyssinia. Arnold however claims \\"there is not the slightest historical base for this legend.\\"Arnold, p. 296. Return to Arabia In summer 628, the last of the Muslim immigrants departed from Abyssinia to join the Muslim community in Medina. Ja'far and his family were among them.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 526. On arriving at Medina, Ja'far heard that Muhammad was in Khaybar. Ja'far immediately set out to join the army, and arrived just as Muhammad had won the battle. Muhammad greeted him with the words: \\"I do not know which event makes me happier ‚Äì the arrival of Ja'far or the conquest of Khaybar!\\"Waqidi, Kitab al-Maghazi. Translated by Faizer, R., Ismail, A., & Tayob, A. (2011). The Life of Muhammad p. 336. Oxford: Routledge. Ja'far was famous for his acts of charity in Medina. Abu Hurairah recalled: \\"The most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.\\"Bukhari 5:57:57. The Battle of Mu'tah In September 629, Muhammad mobilized an army to confront Byzantine forces in Syria,Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 532. because a Byzantine governor had killed one of his emissaries.Waqidi/Faizer p. 372. He appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as commander of the army and instructed: \\"If Zayd is wounded or killed, Ja‚Äôfar ibn Abu Talib will take over the command. If Ja'far is killed or wounded, Abdullah ibn Rawahah will take his place. If Abdullah is killed, then let the Muslims appoint themselves a commander.\\" The Muslims met the Byzantines at Mu'tah,Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 534. where they were heavily outnumbered. Zayd was among the first Muslims to be killed in the battle, and Ja'far then took over his standard and assumed command. Mounted on his horse, he penetrated deep into the Byzantine ranks. As he spurred his horse on, he called out: \\"How wonderful is Paradise as it draws near! How pleasant and cool is its drink! Punishment for the Byzantines is not far away!\\" Ja'far fought until both his arms were cut off, but he was eventually killed. \\"A Roman struck him and cut him in two-halves. One half fell on the grape vine, and roughly thirty wounds were found on it. The body of Ja'far held seventy-two scars between his shoulders, where he had been either struck by a sword or pierced by a spear.\\"Waqidi/Faizer p. 374. =Aftermath= When the news reached Muhammad, he wept and prayed for Ja'far's soul. He later reported that the angel Jibril (Gabriel) came down to console him, saying: \\"Jafar was a brave and loyal soldier. God has given him everlasting life, and in place of his arms which were cut off in the battle, the Lord has given him a pair of wings.\\" Thereafter Ja'far had the byname Dhul-JanƒÅ·∏•ƒ´n (, \\"The Winged\\").Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 234. Ja'far's widow Asma recalled: \\"God's Messenger came to me and asked, 'Where are Jafar's children?' I brought them to him and he embraced them and smelled them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. 'O God's Messenger,' I asked, 'Have you heard something about Jafar?' 'Yes,' he replied. 'He was killed today.' I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, 'O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!'\\" Her son Abdullah remembered: \\"He said, 'O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja'far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!'\\" Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatimah, \\"Prepare food for the family of Ja'far, for they are preoccupied today.\\"Waqidi/Faizer p. 377.

Comminution, also known as cataclasis, is an important process in forming cataclasites. They fall into the category of cataclastic rocks which are formed through faulting or fracturing in the upper crust. Cataclasites are distinguished from fault gouge, which is incohesive, and fault breccia, which contains coarser fragments. Cataclasite under a petrographic microscope. The rock in part of the Malm Formation of the Helvetic nappes; sample found in a landslide near Engelberg in the Swiss Alps. Thin section image of a cataclasite in both plane polarized light (right) and crossed polarized light (left). Contact between highly fractured wall rock (right) and clast supported cataclasite (left) is outlined in red. This rock is from the San Andreas Fault at Elizabeth Lake, California.  Types  Cataclasites are composed of fragments of the pre- existing wall rock as well as a matrix consisting of crushed microfragments, which cohesively holds the rock together. There are different types of classification schemes for cataclasites in the fault rock literature. The original classification scheme by Sibson classifies them by their proportion of fine-grained matrix to angular fragments. The term fault breccia is used for describing a cataclasite with coarser grains. A fault breccia is a cataclastic rock with clasts that are larger than 2 mm making up at least 30% of the rock. These are the varieties based on the classification scheme of cataclasites proposed by Sibson: * Protocataclasite is a type of cataclasite in which the matrix takes up less than 50% of the total volume, * Mesocataclasite is a type of cataclasite in which the matrix occupies between 50 and 90 percent of the total volume, and * Ultracataclasite is a type of cataclasite characterized by a matrix occupying greater than 90% of the total volume. This classification scheme separates distinct features of cataclasites, but any fault rock that has been formed through brittle deformation mechanisms containing pieces of the fractured pre-exisitng rock type are normally referred to as cataclasites. Cataclasites are different from mylonites, another type of fault rock, that is classified by the presence of a schistosity formed through ductile deformation methods. Although cataclasites often lack an oriented fabric, some cataclasites are foliated. According to Sibson's 1975 classification scheme, these would be classified as mylonites although, through experiments, it was proven that some cataclastic mechanisms can form cataclasites with an oriented foliation solely due to brittle deformation. In a modification to the original definitions, the foliated fault rock would be still considered a cataclasite because it was created by cataclastic mechanisms. Thin section image of a foliated cataclasite in both plane polarized light (right) and crossed polarized light (left). The banding in this cataclasite is defined by grain size and ratio of clasts to matrix. This rock is from the San Andreas Fault at Elizabeth Lake, California. Formation Cataclasites form though the progressive fracturing of mineral grains and aggregates, a process known as comminution. Cataclasites are the result of comminution, along with frictional sliding and grain rotation during faulting. This crushing, frictional sliding and rotation of grains is referred to as cataclasis. Comminution, along with frictional sliding and grain boundary rotation can allow a rock to macroscopically flow over a wide brittle zone in the crust. This macroscopic flow due to the combination of brittle deformation mechanisms can be referred to as Deformation mechanism#Cataclasitic flow.  Setting  Many faults near the earth‚Äôs surface are brittle and show evidence of low temperature deformation. At low temperatures, there is not enough energy for the crystal grains to deform plastically, thus each grain fractures as opposed to elongation or recrystallizing. In these systems, cataclasites would be more likely to form as opposed to mylonites, which would require crystal plastic deformation. Due to quartz being the main mineral in many rocks in the brittle regime of the crust, the brittle-ductile transition for quartz can be a good indication of where cataclasites would form before ductile deformation plays a role. This normally refers to the uppermost 10-12 km of the continental crust.

The team has played in both French and German football leagues, as the political fortunes of the region have changed. History Logo of FV Stra√üburg'Fussball Klub Stra√üburg was founded on 19 May 1890 and played in the VSFV (Verband S√ºddeutscher Fussballvereine or Federation of South German Football Teams). A merger with FC Celeritas Stra√üburg on 24 December 1898 led to the team being renamed Fussball Verein Stra√üburg. The club won the league title in 1899 with a 4:3 victory over Karlsruher FV. The two teams played a re-match in the following year's final, but the result has been lost to history. That same year FV became one of the founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) at Leipzig. In 1902 the club's second team captured the VSFV second division title. From 1909 to 1912, the club played in the tier-one S√ºdkreis-Liga. The team's performance fell off over the next decade, but by 1917 Stra√üburg had resurfaced in the league playoff rounds, losing the 1917 final to Stuttgarter Kickers and going out in the semi-finals in 1918. After World War I Strasbourg was ceded to France as part of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine and FV Stra√üburg was removed from the German football scene in 1920 to play in the French leagues, first as Strasbourger FV, and following a union that same year with Strasbourger FC Donar (established 22 November 1899), as Association Sportive de Strasbourg. During the interwar period AS Strasbourg played in the top flight regional Division d'Honneur Alsace and regularly delivered top-three finishes there. They participated in the league championship in 1926, 1927, and 1928, coming away as winners in 1926. After re-organization of French football leagues in 1932 Strasbourg played in lower divisions. Team kit of FV Sta√üburg ca. 1940 The region was conquered and held briefly by Germany during World War II and FV Stra√üburg was one of several former German sides that returned to play in that country's football competition. Once again playing as Sportverein Stra√üburg 1890 the club made a single season appearance in the top flight Gauliga Elsa√ü in 1940-41. They won promotion back to the weakened Gauliga in 1944 but the division collapsed as conflict overtook the area. The club resumed play as the Association Sportive de Strasbourg in late 1944 and enjoyed some success as a French amateur side through the 60s. Their latest honours, nearly a quarter century old, are a fourth division national title and a Coupe d'Alsace win in the early 80s. In addition to fielding a football team, the club also has athletics and basketball departments.

Phase shifts themselves are invisible, but become visible when shown as brightness variations. When light waves travel through a medium other than a vacuum, interaction with the medium causes the wave amplitude and phase to change in a manner dependent on properties of the medium. Changes in amplitude (brightness) arise from the scattering and absorption of light, which is often wavelength-dependent and may give rise to colors. Photographic equipment and the human eye are only sensitive to amplitude variations. Without special arrangements, phase changes are therefore invisible. Yet, phase changes often convey important information. The same cells imaged with traditional bright-field microscopy (left), and with phase-contrast microscopy (right) Phase-contrast microscopy is particularly important in biology. It reveals many cellular structures that are invisible with a bright-field microscope, as exemplified in the figure. These structures were made visible to earlier microscopists by staining, but this required additional preparation and death of the cells. The phase- contrast microscope made it possible for biologists to study living cells and how they proliferate through cell division. It is one of the few methods available to quantify cellular structure and components that does not use fluorescence. After its invention in the early 1930s, phase-contrast microscopy proved to be such an advancement in microscopy that its inventor Frits Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953.  Working principle  Dark field and phase contrast microscopies operating principle The basic principle to making phase changes visible in phase-contrast microscopy is to separate the illuminating (background) light from the specimen-scattered light (which makes up the foreground details) and to manipulate these differently. The ring-shaped illuminating light (green) that passes the condenser annulus is focused on the specimen by the condenser. Some of the illuminating light is scattered by the specimen (yellow). The remaining light is unaffected by the specimen and forms the background light (red). When observing an unstained biological specimen, the scattered light is weak and typically phase-shifted by ‚àí90¬∞ (due to both the typical thickness of specimens and the refractive index difference between biological tissue and the surrounding medium) relative to the background light. This leads to the foreground (blue vector) and background (red vector) having nearly the same intensity, resulting in low image contrast. In a phase-contrast microscope, image contrast is increased in two ways: by generating constructive interference between scattered and background light rays in regions of the field of view that contain the specimen, and by reducing the amount of background light that reaches the image plane. First, the background light is phase-shifted by ‚àí90¬∞ by passing it through a phase-shift ring, which eliminates the phase difference between the background and the scattered light rays. 450pxWhen the light is then focused on the image plane (where a camera or eyepiece is placed), this phase shift causes background and scattered light rays originating from regions of the field of view that contain the sample (i.e., the foreground) to constructively interfere, resulting in an increase in the brightness of these areas compared to regions that do not contain the sample. Finally, the background is dimmed ~70-90% by a gray filter ring; this method maximizes the amount of scattered light generated by the illumination (i.e., background) light, while minimizing the amount of illumination light that reaches the image plane. Some of the scattered light that illuminates the entire surface of the filter will be phase-shifted and dimmed by the rings, but to a much lesser extent than the background light,which only illuminates the phase-shift and gray filter rings. The above describes negative phase contrast. In its positive form, the background light is instead phase-shifted by +90¬∞. The background light will thus be 180¬∞ out of phase relative to the scattered light. The scattered light will then be subtracted from the background light to form an image with a darker foreground and a lighter background, as shown in the first figure. Related methods thumbleft150px  S cerevisiae cells imaged by DIC microscopy thumbright  A quantitative phase-contrast microscopy image of cells in culture. The height and color of an image point correspond to the optical thickness, which only depends on the object's thickness and the relative refractive index. The volume of an object can thus be determined when the difference in refractive index between the object and the surrounding media is known. The success of the phase-contrast microscope has led to a number of subsequent phase-imaging methods. In 1952, Georges Nomarski patented what is today known as differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. It enhances contrast by creating artificial shadows, as if the object is illuminated from the side. But DIC microscopy is unsuitable when the object or its container alter polarization. With the growing use of polarizing plastic containers in cell biology, DIC microscopy is increasingly replaced by Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy, invented by Robert Hoffman in 1975. Traditional phase-contrast methods enhance contrast optically, blending brightness and phase information in a single image. Since the introduction of the digital camera in the mid-1990s, several new digital phase-imaging methods have been developed, collectively known as quantitative phase-contrast microscopy. These methods digitally create two separate images, an ordinary bright-field image and a so-called phase-shift image. In each image point, the phase-shift image displays the quantified phase shift induced by the object, which is proportional to the optical thickness of the object.

Its purpose is to make the transmitted signal better suited to its purpose or the communication channel, typically by limiting the effective bandwidth of the transmission. By filtering the transmitted pulses this way, the intersymbol interference caused by the channel can be kept in control. In RF communication, pulse shaping is essential for making the signal fit in its frequency band. Typically pulse shaping occurs after line coding and modulation. Need for pulse shaping Transmitting a signal at high modulation rate through a band-limited channel can create intersymbol interference. As the modulation rate increases, the signal's bandwidth increases. When the signal's bandwidth becomes larger than the channel bandwidth, the channel starts to introduce distortion to the signal. This distortion usually manifests itself as intersymbol interference. The signal's spectrum is determined by the modulation scheme and data rate used by the transmitter, but can be modified with a pulse shaping filter. Usually the transmitted symbols are represented as a time sequence of dirac delta pulses. This theoretical signal is then filtered with the pulse shaping filter, producing the transmitted signal. In many base band communication systems the pulse shaping filter is implicitly a boxcar filter. Its Fourier transform is of the form sin(x)/x, and has significant signal power at frequencies higher than symbol rate. This is not a big problem when optical fibre or even twisted pair cable is used as the communication channel. However, in RF communications this would waste bandwidth, and only tightly specified frequency bands are used for single transmissions. In other words, the channel for the signal is band-limited. Therefore better filters have been developed, which attempt to minimise the bandwidth needed for a certain symbol rate. An example in other areas of electronics is the generation of pulses where the rise time need to be short; one way to do this is to start with a slower-rising pulse, and decrease the rise time, for example with a step recovery diode circuit. Pulse shaping filters NRZ coded signal is implicitly filtered with a sinc filter. Not every filter can be used as a pulse shaping filter. The filter itself must not introduce intersymbol interference ‚Äî it needs to satisfy certain criteria. The Nyquist ISI criterion is a commonly used criterion for evaluation, because it relates the frequency spectrum of the transmitter signal to intersymbol interference. Examples of pulse shaping filters that are commonly found in communication systems are: * Sinc shaped filter * Raised-cosine filter * Gaussian filter Sender side pulse shaping is often combined with a receiver side matched filter to achieve optimum tolerance for noise in the system. In this case the pulse shaping is equally distributed between the sender and receiver filters. The filters' amplitude responses are thus pointwise square roots of the system filters. Other approaches that eliminate complex pulse shaping filters have been invented. In OFDM, the carriers are modulated so slowly that each carrier is virtually unaffected by the bandwidth limitation of the channel. = Sinc filter = Amplitude response of raised-cosine filter with various roll-off factors It is also called as Boxcar filter as its frequency domain equivalent is a rectangular shape. Theoretically the best pulse shaping filter would be the sinc filter, but it cannot be implemented precisely. It is a non-causal filter with relatively slowly decaying tails. It is also problematic from a synchronisation point of view as any phase error results in steeply increasing intersymbol interference. = Raised-cosine filter = Raised-cosine is similar to sinc, with the tradeoff of smaller sidelobes for a slightly larger spectral width. Raised-cosine filters are practical to implement and they are in wide use. They have a configurable excess bandwidth, so communication systems can choose a trade off between a simpler filter and spectral efficiency. =Gaussian filter= This gives an output pulse shaped like a Gaussian function.

Downtime or outage duration refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function. Reliability, availability, recovery, and unavailability are related concepts. The unavailability is the proportion of a time-span that a system is unavailable or offline. This is usually a result of the system failing to function because of an unplanned event, or because of routine maintenance (a planned event). The term is commonly applied to networks and servers. The common reasons for unplanned outages are system failures (such as a crash) or communications failures (commonly known as network outage). The term is also commonly applied in industrial environments in relation to failures in industrial production equipment. Some facilities measure the downtime incurred during a work shift, or during a 12- or 24-hour period. Another common practice is to identify each downtime event as having an operational, electrical or mechanical origin. The opposite of downtime is uptime. Types Industry standards for the term \\"Outage Duration\\" or \\"Maintenance Duration\\" can have different point of initiation and completion thus the following clarification should be used to avoid conflicts in contract execution: # \\"Turnkey\\" this is the most engrossing of all outage types. Outage or Maintenance starts with operator of the plant or equipment pressing the shutdown or stop button to initiate a halt in operation. Unless otherwise noted, Outage or Maintenance is considered completed when the plant or equipment is back in normal operation ready to begin manufacturing or ready be synchronized with system or grid or ready to perform duties as pump or compressor. # \\"Breaker to Breaker\\" This Outage or Maintenance starts with operator of the plant or equipment removing the power circuit (Main power breaker at \\"off\\" or \\"disengaged\\" or \\"On-Cooldown\\"), not the control circuit from operation. This still would allow for the equipment to be cooled down or brought to ambient such that outage/maintenance work can be prepared or initiated. Depending on equipment types, \\"Breaker to Breaker\\" outage can be advantageous if contracting out controls related maintenance as this type of maintenance work can be performed while main equipment is still on cool-down or on stand-by. Unless otherwise noted, this type of outage is considered complete when power circuit is re-energized via engaging of the power breaker. # \\"Completion of Lock-out/Tag-out\\" This Outage or Maintenance (sometimes mistaken for \\"Off-Cooldown\\" but not the same) starts with operator of the plant or equipment removing the power circuit, disengaging the control circuit and performing other neutralization of potential power and hazard sources (typically called Lock-Out, Tag-Out \\"LOTO\\") This point of maintenance period is typically the last phase of the outage initiation stage before actual work starts on the facility, plant or equipment. Safety briefing should always follow the LOTO activity, before any work is conducted. Unless otherwise noted, this type of outage is considered complete when the equipment has reached mechanical completion and ready to be placed on slow-roll for many heavy rotating equipment, Bump-test or rotation check for motors, etc., but must follow return or work permit per LOTO procedures. Any on-line testing, performance testing and tuning required should not count towards the outage duration as these activities are typically conducted after the completion of outage or maintenance event and are out of control of most maintenance contractors. Characteristics Unplanned downtime may be the result of an equipment malfunction, etc. =Telecommunication outage classifications= Downtime can be caused by failure in hardware (physical equipment), (logic controlling equipment), interconnecting equipment (such as cables, facilities, routers,...), transmission (wireless, microwave, satellite), and/or capacity (system limits). The failures can occur because of damage, failure, design, procedural (improper use by humans), engineering (how to use and deployment), overload (traffic or system resources stressed beyond designed limits), environment (support systems like power and HVAC), (outages designed into the system for a purpose such as software upgrades and equipment growth), other (none of the above but known), or unknown. The failures can be the responsibility of customer/service provider, vendor/supplier, utility, government, contractor, end customer, public individual, act of nature, other (none of the above but known), or unknown. Impact Outages caused by system failures can have a serious impact on the users of computer/network systems, in particular those industries that rely on a nearly 24-hour service: * Medical informatics * Nuclear power and other infrastructure * Banks and other financial institutions * Aeronautics, airlines * News reporting * E-commerce and online transaction processing * Persistent online games Also affected can be the users of an ISP and other customers of a telecommunication network. Corporations can lose business due to network outage or they may default on a contract, resulting in financial losses. According to Veeam 2019 cloud data management report organizations encounter unplanned downtime, on average, 5-10 times per year with the average cost of one hour of one hour of downtime being $102,450. https://go.veeam.com/cloud-data-management-report-2019 Those people or organizations that are affected by downtime can be more sensitive to particular aspects: * some are more affected by the length of an outage - it matters to them how much time it takes to recover from a problem * others are sensitive to the timing of an outage - outages during peak hours affect them the most The most demanding users are those that require high availability. Famous outages On Mother's Day, Sunday, May 8, 1988, a fire broke out in the main switching room of the Hinsdale Central Office of the Illinois Bell telephone company.

PC World, January 4, 2008. Sony's PlayStation Network April 2011 outage, began on April 20, 2011, and was gradually restored on May 14, 2011 starting in the United States. This outage is the longest amount of time the PSN has been offline since its inception in 2006. Sony has stated the problem was caused by an external intrusion which resulted in the confiscation of personal information.https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j9AacQSaJXBQ3JUqZWxemjT8nMPw?docId=916344d02c284103af70f845db4befc1 Sony reported on April 26, 2011 that a large amount of user data had been obtained by the same hack that resulted in the downtime. Telstra's Ryde switch failed in late 2011 after water egressed into the electrical switch board from continuing wet weather. The Ryde switch is one of the largest by area switches in Australia, and affected more than 720,000 services. The Miami datacenter of ServerAxis went offline unannounced on February 29, 2016 and was never restored. This impacted multiple providers and hundreds of websites. The outage impacted coverage of the 2016 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament as WBBState, one of the affected sites, was by far the most comprehensive provider of women's basketball statistics available.A Website Went Offline And Took Most Of Women's College Basketball Analytics With It FiveThirtyEight Service levels In service level agreements, it is common to mention a percentage value (per month or per year) that is calculated by dividing the sum of all downtimes timespans by the total time of a reference time span (e.g. a month). 0% downtime means that the server was available all the time. For Internet servers downtimes above 1% per year or worse can be regarded as unacceptable as this means a downtime of more than 3 days per year. For e-commerce and other industrial use any value above 0.1% is usually considered unacceptable. Response and reduction of impact It is the duty of the network designer to make sure that a network outage does not happen. When it does happen, a well-designed system will further reduce the effects of an outage by having localized outages which can be detected and fixed as soon as possible. A process needs to be in place to detect a malfunction - network monitoring - and to restore the network to a working condition - this generally involves a help desk team that can troubleshoot a problem, one composed of trained engineers; a separate help desk team is usually necessary in order to field user input, which can be particularly demanding during a downtime. A network management system can be used to detect faulty or degrading components prior to customer complaints, with proactive fault rectification. Risk management techniques can be used to determine the impact of network outages on an organisation and what actions may be required to minimise risk. Risk may be minimised by using reliable components, by performing maintenance, such as upgrades, by using redundant systems or by having a contingency plan or business continuity plan. Technical means can reduce errors with error correcting codes, retransmission, checksums, or diversity scheme. One of the biggest causes of downtime is misconfiguration, where a planned change goes wrong. Typically organisations rely on manual effort to manage the process of configuration backups, but this requires highly skilled engineers with the time to manage the process across a multi- vendor network. Automation tools are available to manage backups, but there are very few solutions that handle configuration recovery which is needed to minimize the overall impact of the outage. In industrial environments, downtime caused by failures in industrial production equipment can have several forms of preventative measures in place to measure quality assurance and monitor hardware. Visual inspections can be performed involving individuals manually inspecting equipment. While these inspections are in place to reduce \\"unexpected downtime\\" at an industrial site, this form of inspection can create downtime due to a lengthy process depending on the size of a site. Sensors, vibration monitoring systems, voltage loggers, thermometers and other monitoring systems can be placed on or near equipment to measure quality and monitor their usage. These sensors can serve as an \\"always-on\\" form of monitoring that can detect an existing problem or may predict a future problem. These systems are seen as a great way to reduce downtime as many machines can continue to run as the sensors gather data. Robotics are playing an ever larger role in the monitoring process with deep learning robots, drones, mobile robots, among other uses. Monitoring and inspections carried out by robots are considered a good way to reduce downtime as with many robots, plants or other industrial sites do not need to cease operation, and can in fact continue to operate during inspection. The reduction of human interaction in both robotics and sensor monitoring can reduce overall cost by lowering headcount and cut downtime during inspections. Planning A planned outage is the result of a planned activity by the system owner and/or by a service provider. These outages, often scheduled during the maintenance window, can be used to perform tasks including the following: * Deferred maintenance, e.g., a deferred hardware repair or a deferred restart to clean up a garbled memory * Diagnostics to isolate a detected fault * Hardware fault repair * Fixing an error or omission in a configuration database or omission in a recent configuration database change * Fixing an error in application database or an error in a recent application database change * Software patching/software updates to fix a software fault. Outages can also be planned as a result of a predictable natural event, such as Sun outage. Maintenance downtimes have to be carefully scheduled in industries that rely on computer systems. In many cases, system-wide downtimes can be averted using what is called a \\"rolling upgrade\\" - the process of incrementally taking down parts of the system for upgrade, without affecting the overall functionality. Avoidance For most websites, website monitoring is available. Website monitoring (synthetic or passive) is a service that \\"monitors\\" downtime and users on the site. Other usage Downtime can also refer to time when human capital or other assets go down. For instance, if employees are in meetings or unable to perform their work due to another constraint, they are down. This can be equally expensive, and can be the result of another asset (i.e. computer/systems) being down. This is also commonly known as \\"dead time\\". Downtime is also generalized in a personal sense, being used to refer to a period of sleep or recreation. This term is used also in factories or industrial use. See total productive maintenance (TPM). Measuring downtime There are many external services which can be used to monitor the uptime and downtime as well as availability of a service or a host.

She was scrapped in 2004. History England named in honor of Ensign John C. England. He was born in Harris, Missouri, on 11 December 1920. He attended Pasadena City College, in Pasadena, California, and was on the pep-squad there. He enlisted in the Naval Reserve on 6 September 1940 and was commissioned ensign on 6 June 1941. On 3 September 1941 he reported for duty on the battleship and was killed three months later while saving others aboard during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. CG/DLG-22 was the second USS England. The first was , the ship that sank six enemy submarines in 12 days in May 1944. That act caused the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest King, to declare \\"There‚Äôll always be an England in the United States Navy.\\" DE-635 was decommissioned in 1945. To fulfill Admiral King's promise, USS England DLG-22 was built by Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California.

England was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon for supporting search and rescue operations in the Gulf of Tonkin from 3 January to 6 June 1966.USS England Navy Unit Commendation citation Originally called a \\"destroyer leader\\" or frigate (DLG), in 1975 she was re-designated a cruiser (CG) in the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification. England was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation a final time for actions performed 2 August to 16 August 1990. As the leading Naval Warship in the region, England assumed primary shipping interdiction and air defense roles while forces were mobilized to support what would become Operation Desert Shield. She was decommissioned on 21 January 1994, mothballed in the Suisun Bay for ten years and was sold for scrap to International Shipbreaking Ltd., Brownsville, Texas (USA). Scrapping was completed on 20 October 2004.

Indexed by JRI-Poland.) was a rabbinic Hasidic thinker and founder of the Izhbitza-Radzyn dynasty of Hasidic Judaism. Rabbi Mordechai Yosef was born in Tomashov () in 1801 to his father Reb Yaakov the son of Reb Mordechai of Sekul, a descendant of Rabbi Saul Wahl. At the age of two he became orphaned of his father. He became a disciple of Reb Simcha Bunim of Peshischa where he joined Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk and Rabbi Yosef of Yartshev; both were also born in Tomashov. When Rabbi Menachem Mendel became Rebbe in Kotzk, Reb Mordechai Yosef became his disciple there; then in 1839 became himself a rebbe in Tomasz√≥w, moving subsequently to Izbica. His leading disciple was Rabbi Yehuda Leib Eiger (1816-1888The State Archive of Lublin: \\"Jewish Civil Registry of Lublin\\", 1888, Akt#: 46, Registration Type: death, Registration Year: 1888, Location: Lublin, Surname: Ejger, Given Name: Lejbus, Father: Szloma, Mother: Golda Rywka. Indexed by JRI-Poland.), grandson of Rabbi Akiva Eiger. His students included Rabbi Zadok HaKohen of Lublin (1823‚Äì1900), his son, Rabbi Yaakov Leiner (1828‚Äì1878) and his grandson Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner of Radzyn. Mordechai Yosef Leiner is buried in an ohel in the Jewish cemetery in Izbica.  Thought  Rabbi Leiner is best known for his work Mei Hashiloach, a compilation of his teachings by his grandson, in which he expressed the doctrine that all events, including human actions, are absolutely under God's control, or as Rabbinic discourse would phrase it, by \\"hashgacha pratis.\\" Thus, if everything is determined by God, then even sin is done in accordance with God's will. He presents defenses of various Biblical sins, such as Korach's rebellion, Zimri during the Heresy of Peor, and Judah's incident with Tamar. One of his most cited comments is on Leviticus 21:1 : :None shall defile himself for any [dead] person among his kin. Rabbi Leiner read the verse as a warning against the defilement of the soul. The soul is defiled when it is infected with the bitterness and rage that comes with senseless suffering and tragedy. Those who ‚Äî like the Kohanim‚Äî would serve God, are commanded to find the resources to resist the defilements of despair and darkness. Despair is the ultimate denial of God, and surrender to darkness is the ultimate blasphemy. The publication of Mei Hashiloach was met with controversy and some burned copies of the work.*Morris Faierstein, All is in the Hands of Heaven: The Teachings of Rabbi Mordecai Yosef Leiner of Izbica (New York: Ktav, 1989) Alan Brill of Seton Hall University has suggested that the teachings of Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz may have influenced Rabbi Leiner's thinking.* Alan Brill, Thinking God: The Mysticism of Rabbi Zadok HaKohen Of Lublin (Yeshiva University Press, Ktav 2002)  Relationship with the Kotzker Rebbe  Rabbi Leiner was the right-hand man of the Kotzker rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, by whom he was charged with overseeing the Hasidim. In 1839 Leiner had a public and dramatic falling out with the Kotzker Rebbe. On the day after Simchat Torah of that year, Leiner left Kotzk with many of his followers to form his own hasidic circle. The reasons given for the break are varied.  Influence  His thought influenced (mostly indirectly, through the work of Leiner's student, Reb Tzadok Hakohen) the mussar of Rabbi Isaac Hutner and Rabbi Moshe Wolfson. Leiner's thought continued to have influence in the twentieth century, especially on Neo- Hasidism, and the teachings of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach (the \\"singing rabbi\\"). Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach is credited with the recent popularization of Rabbi Leiner's teachings. He apparently came across Rabbi Leiner's work in an old Jewish book store. He is quoted as saying that after initially being perplexed as to the peculiar nature of the teachings he quickly realized that in it lay the \\"secret for turning Jews on to the deeper meanings of Judaism\\".

Directed by John Schlesinger, it stars Tom Courtenay (who had understudied Albert Finney in the West End theatre adaptation of the novel) as Billy, and Julie Christie as Liz, one of his three girlfriends. Mona Washbourne plays Mrs. Fisher, and Wilfred Pickles plays Mr. Fisher. Rodney Bewes, Finlay Currie and Leonard Rossiter also feature. The Cinemascope photography is by Denys Coop, and Richard Rodney Bennett supplied the score. The film belongs to the British New Wave (or \\"kitchen sink drama\\") movement, inspired by the earlier French New Wave. Characteristic of the style is a documentary/cin√©ma v√©rit√© feel and the use of real locations (in this case, many in the city of Bradford in Yorkshire). The film opened at the Warner Theatre in London's West End on 15 August 1963.The Times, 15 August 1963, Page 2 Plot Billy Fisher (Tom Courtenay) lives in Yorkshire with his parents (Wilfred Pickles and Mona Washbourne) and grandmother (Ethel Griffies). Billy wishes to get away from his stifling job and family life. To escape the boredom of his humdrum existence, he constantly daydreams and fantasises, often picturing himself as the ruler and military hero of an imaginary country called Ambrosia. In his fantasies, he gives speeches to large crowds in a manner resembling Hitler or Mussolini. He makes up stories about himself and his family, causing him to be nicknamed \\"Billy Liar.\\" In reality, he lives in a lower middle class home in Yorkshire with parents who constantly scold and nag him about his behavior. Billy works as an undertakers' clerk overseen by the rigid Mr. Shadrack (Leonard Rossiter). At work, he is tasked with mailing out a large shipment of advertising calendars to potential customers, but instead hides the calendars and keeps the postage money. When he notices the calendars in his wardrobe, he dreams of being imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs for the crime of pocketing the postage money. He is eventually found out by Shadrack, who refuses to let him resign from his position until he pays back the postage money. Billy aspires to get a more interesting job as a scriptwriter for comic Danny Boon (Leslie Randall), but when Boon comes to town, he is not interested in Billy's overtures. However, he tells everyone that Boon is very interested in his stories and that he will be moving to London very soon. Whenever Billy experiences something unpleasant; his parents scolding him, his boss harassing him, he imagines himself to be somewhere else. His fantasies generally involve himself as a hero with everyone very pleased with him. However, Billy shows himself to be happier fantasizing about being a great success than actually taking a risk to make something of himself. Billy has further complicated his life by proposing to two very different girls, the sheltered, virginal Barbara (Helen Fraser) and the tough, brassy Rita (Gwendolyn Watts). He has given the same engagement ring to each girl and lies constantly to get it back from one and give it to the other. Rita discovers he has lied about the ring being at the jewellers and shows up at Billy's door but he lies to her again and she leaves. When Billy's father questions him about what he is doing with Rita, Billy yells at him and his shocked grandmother begins gasping for breath and has to lay down. Billy feels guilty but imagines himself as a general winning a difficult war. Billy also finds himself attracted to his former girlfriend Liz (Julie Christie), who has just returned to town after extensive travels. Liz is a free spirit who, unlike anyone else in town, understands and accepts Billy's imagination. However, she has more courage and confidence than Billy, as shown by her willingness to leave her home town and enjoy new and different experiences. Under pressure, Billy ends up making dates with both Barbara and Rita to meet each one on the same night at the same local ballroom. There, the two girls discover the double engagement and begin fighting with each other. All of Billy's lies seem to catch up with him as it's announced publicly that he is moving to London to work with Danny Boon, and Billy's friend scolds him for lying to his mother. Distraught, Billy encounters Liz outside and shares a romantic interlude with her, during which he shares his fantasies about Ambrosia. He proposes to her and she accepts. She urges him to accompany her to London that evening, and he goes home to pack his bags, only to find his grandmother has fallen ill and been taken to hospital. Billy gets into a blowout with his father who has found out about Billy's problems at work and trashed Billy's room. Billy joins his mother at the hospital just in time to learn his grandmother has died. He then continues to the station to meet Liz, and the couple board the train, but at the last minute Billy disembarks with the excuse of buying some milk to drink on the journey. By the time he gets back to the train, it is pulling out, with an understanding Liz at the window and his suitcase left behind on the platform. Alone, Billy walks the dark deserted road back to his home, imagining himself leading the marching army of Ambrosia.

Originally called a destroyer leader or frigate (DLG-23), on 30 June 1975 she was redesignated a cruiser (CG-23) in the U.S. Navy's ship reclassification. Construction Halsey launched 15 January 1962 at San Francisco Naval Shipyard; sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Denham and Miss Jane Halsey, granddaughters of the late Fleet Admiral; commissioned 20 July 1963, Captain H. H. Anderson, USN, in command. The ceremonies included a eulogy by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, USN, on Fleet Admiral Halsey's illustrious career. History Halsey departed from San Francisco on 25 November 1963 for Dabob Bay and Carr Island to conduct anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system alignment tests and acoustical surveys until 7 December. She arrived at her home port of San Diego, California on 11 December 1963. Halsey was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 7, Destroyer Division 71 on 13 December, and participated in a special sea power demonstration for the Secretary of the Navy, acting as screen commander from 15‚Äì18 December. She conducted her weapons qualification trials from 15 January 1964 to 14 February, and fired her first missiles on the Pacific Missile Range on 10 February 1964. After a shakedown cruise from 16 March to 1 May, she returned to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 15 May 1964; and concluded her post-shakedown on 17 July 1964. During her first years of active service, Halsey experimented with a unique system of internal organization combining all the aspects of the weapons systems and CIC under a combat officer; and separate hull and communications administration departments. In 1966, Halsey was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 7, Destroyer Division 71, in the Pacific Fleet. On 2 July, she left San Diego for Subic Bay, Philippines. By August, she was conducting air-sea rescue and ASW operations in the South China Sea. During this period, Halsey rescued some 16 airmen in two cruises in the Gulf of Tonkin. On 5 December, the frigate departed from Yokosuka, Japan, for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 21 December. The first quarter of 1967 was spent in training cruises off the West Coast. On 10 April, Halsey left San Diego for an overhaul period at San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard that continued into August. By September, Halsey was again involved in further exercises testing her capabilities. Halsey was reclassified as a guided-missile cruiser and redesignated CG-23 on 30 June 1975. Fate Halsey was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1994. She was scrapped in 2003.

Transient errors are typically caused by single event upsets, insufficient power, or by strong electromagnetic signals transmitted by some other \\"source\\" device. Immunity-aware programming is an example of defensive programming and EMC-aware programming. Although most of these techniques apply to the software in the \\"victim\\" device to make it more reliable, a few of these techniques apply to software in the \\"source\\" device to make it emit less unwanted noise. Task and objectives Microcontrollers' firmware can inexpensively improve the electromagnetic compatibility of an embedded system. Embedded systems firmware is usually not considered to be a source of radio frequency interference. Radio emissions are often caused by harmonic frequencies of the system clock and switching currents. The pulses on these wires can have fast rise and fall times, causing their wires to act as radio transmitters. This effect is increased by badly-designed printed circuit boards. These effects are reduced by using microcontroller output drivers with slower rise times, or by turning off system components. The microcontroller is easy to control. It is also susceptible to faults from radio frequency interference. Therefore, making the microcontroller's software resist such errors can cheaply improve the system's tolerance for electromagnetic interference by reducing the need for hardware alterations. Possible interferences of microcontroller-based systems CMOS microcontrollers have specific weak spots which can be strengthened by software that works against electromagnetic interference. Failure mode and effects analysis of a system and its requirements is often required. Electromagnetic compatibility issues can easily be added to such an analysis. =Power supply= Slow changes of power supply voltage do not cause significant disturbances, but rapid changes can make unpredictable trouble. If a voltage exceeds parameters in the controller's data sheet by 150 percent, it can cause the input port or the output port to get hung in one state, known as CMOS latch-up.Latch-up ‚Äì also known as Single Event Latch-up (SEL) ‚Äì is a short circuit of VDD (positive power supply) and VSS (negative power supply). The latch-up is caused by parasitic transistors (transistors that cannot be activated during normal operating conditions) of CMOS circuits. Strong transient disturbances can activate transistors and thermally destroy the device. Without internal current control, latch-up causes the microcontroller to burn out. The standard solution is a mix of software and hardware changes. Most embedded systems have a watchdog timer. This watchdog should be external to the microcontroller so that it is likely to be immune to any plausible electromagnetic interference. It should reset the power supply, briefly switching it off. The watchdog period should be half or less of the time and power required to burn out the microcontroller. The power supply design should be well-grounded and decoupled using capacitors and inductors close to the microcontroller; some typical values are 100uF and 0.1uF in parallel. Low power can cause serious malfunctions in most microcontrollers. For the CPU to successfully decode and execute instructions, the supplied voltage must not drop below the minimum voltage level. When the supplied voltage drops below this level, the CPU may start to execute some instructions incorrectly. The result is unexpected activity on the internal data and control lines. This activity may cause: * CPU register corruption * I/O register corruption * I/O pin random toggling * SRAM corruption * EEPROM corruption Brownout detection solves most of those problems in most systems by causing the system to shut down when main power is unreliable. One typical system retriggers a timer each time that the AC main voltage exceeds 90% of its rated voltage. If the timer expires, it interrupts the microcontroller, which then shuts down its system. Many systems also measure the power supply voltages, to guard against slow power supply degradation. =The oscillator= The input ports of CMOS oscillators have high impedances, and are thus very susceptible to transient disturbances. According to Ohm's law, high impedance causes high voltage differences. They also are very sensitive to short circuit from moisture or dust. One typical failure is when the oscillators' stability is affected. This can cause it to stop, or change its period. The normal system hedges are to have an auxiliary oscillator using some cheap, robust scheme such as a ring of inverters or a resistor-capacitor one-shot timer. After a reset (perhaps caused by a watchdog timer), the system may default to these, only switching in the sensitive crystal oscillator once timing measurements have proven it to be stable. It is also common in high-reliability systems to measure the clock frequency by comparing it to an external standard, usually a communications clock, the power line, or a resistor-capacitor timer. Bursts of electromagnetic interference can shorten clock periods or cause runt pulses that lead to incorrect data access or command execution. The result is wrong memory content or program pointers. The standard method of overcoming this in hardware is to use an on-chip phase locked loop to generate the microcontroller's actual clock signal. Software can periodically verify data structures and read critical ports using voting, distributing the reads in time or space. =Input/output ports= Input/output ports‚Äîincluding address lines and data lines‚Äîconnected by long lines or external peripherals are the antennae that permit disturbances to have effects. Electromagnetic interference can lead to incorrect data and addresses on these lines. Strong fluctuations can cause the computer to misread I/O registers or even stop communication with these ports. Electrostatic discharge can actually destroy ports or cause malfunctions. Most microcontrollers' pins are high impedance inputs or mixed inputs and outputs. High impedance input pins are sensitive to noise, and can register false levels if not properly terminated. Pins that are not terminated inside an IC need resistors attached. These have to be connected to ground or supply, ensuring a known logic state. Cause and effect figure. The cause must be determined, so the problem can be fixed. Corrective actions An analysis of possible errors before correction is very important. The cause must be determined so that the problem can be fixed. The Motor Industry Software Reliability Association identifies the required steps in case of an error as follows: * Information/warning the user * Store the faulty data until a defined reset can be carried out * Keep the system in a defined state until the error can be corrected Fundamentally one uses redundancy to counter faults. This includes running extra code (redundancy in time) as well as keeping extra bits (redundancy in space). =Instruction pointer (IP) error management= A disturbed instruction pointer can lead to serious errors, such as an undefined jump to an arbitrary point in the memory, where illegal instructions are read. The state of the system will be undefined. IP errors can be handled by use of software based solutions such as function tokens and an NOP slide(s). Many processors, such as the Motorola 680x0, feature a hardware trap upon encountering an illegal instruction. A correct instruction, defined in the trap vector, is executed, rather than the random one. Traps can handle a larger range errors than function tokens and NOP slides. Supplementary to illegal instructions, hardware traps securely handle memory access violations, overflows, or a division by zero. Token passing (function token) Token passing as execution flow control C source: token passing with global function ID. Improved noise immunity can be achieved by execution flow control known as token passing. The figure to the right shows the functional principle schematically. This method deals with program flow errors caused by the instruction pointers. The implementation is simple and efficient. Every function is tagged with a unique function ID. When the function is called, the function ID is saved in a global variable. The function is only executed if the function ID in the global variable and the ID of the function match. If the IDs do not match, an instruction pointer error has occurred, and specific corrective actions can be taken. A sample implementation of token passing using a global variable programmed in C is stated in the following source listing. This is essentially an \\"arm / fire\\" sequencing, for every function call. Requiring such a sequence is part of safe programming techniques, as it generates tolerance for single bit (or in this case, stray instruction pointer) faults. The implementation of function tokens increases the program code size by 10 to 20%, and slows down the performance. To improve the implementation, instead of global variables like above, the function ID can be passed as an argument within the functions header as shown in the code sample below. C source: token passing with function parameters NOP slide With NOP-Fills, the reliability of a system in case of a disturbed instruction pointer can be improved in some cases. The entire program memory that is not used by the program code is filled with No- Operation (NOP) instructions. In machine code a NOP instruction is often represented by 0x00 (for example, Intel 8051, ATmega16, etc.). The system is kept in a defined state. At the end of the physical program memory, an instruction pointer error handling (IPEH IP-Error-Handler) has to be implemented. In some cases this can be a simple reset. If an instruction pointer error occurs during the execution and a program points to a memory segment filled with NOP instructions, inevitably an error occurred and is recognized. Three methods of implementing NOP-Fills are applicable: *In the first method, the unused physical memory is set to 0x00 manually by search and replace in the (HEX) program file. The drawback of this method is that this has to be done after every compilation. Program memory filled with code, NOPs, and error handler *The second method uses the fill option of the linker, which fills up the unused memory regions with a predefined constant (in this case 0x00). *The third way is to include a corresponding number of NOP assembler directives directly in the program code. When using the CodevisionAVR C compiler, NOP fills can be implemented easily. The chip programmer offers the feature of editing the program flash and EEPROM to fill it with a specific value. Using an Atmel ATmega16, no jump to reset address 0x00 needs to be implemented, as the overflow of the instruction pointer automatically sets its value to 0x00. Unfortunately, resets due to overflow are not equivalent to intentional reset. During the intended reset, all necessary MC registers are reset by hardware, which is not done by a jump to 0x00. So this method will not be applied in the following tests. Memory before and after the implementation of both function token and NOP-Fills =I/O register errors= Microcontroller architecture requires the I/O leads to be placed at the outer edge of the silicon die. Thus I/O contacts are strongly affected by transient disturbances on their way to the silicon core, and I/O registers are one of the most vulnerable parts of the microcontroller. Wrongly-read I/O registers may lead to an incorrect system state. The most serious errors can occur at the reset port and interrupt input ports. Disturbed data direction registers (DDR) may inhibit writing to the bus. These disturbances can be prevented as following: 1\\\\. Cyclic update of the most important registers :By cyclically updating of the most important register and the data in the data direction registers in shortest possible intervals, errors can be reduced. Thus a wrongly set bit can be corrected before it can have negative effects. 2\\\\. Multiple read of input registers :A further method of filtering disturbances is multiple read of input registers. The read-in values are then checked for consistency. If the values are consistent, they can be considered valid. A definition of a value range and/or the calculation of a mean value can improve the results for some applications. :Side effect: increased activity :A drawback is the increased activity due to permanent updates and readouts of peripherals. This activity may add additional emissions and failures. :External interrupt ports; stack overflow :External interrupts are triggered by falling/rising edges or high/low potential at the interrupt port, leading to an interrupt request (IRQ) in the controller. Hardware interrupts are divided into maskable interrupts and non-maskable interrupts (NMI). The triggering of maskable interrupts can be stopped in some time-critical functions. If an interrupt is called, the current instruction pointer (IP) is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer (SP) is decremented. The address of the interrupt service routine (ISR) is read from the interrupt vector table and loaded to the IP register, and the ISR is executed as a consequence. :If interrupts‚Äîdue to disturbances‚Äîare generated faster than processed, the stack grows until all memory is used. Data on the stack or other data might be overwritten. A defensive software strategy can be applied. The stack pointer (SP) can be watched. The growing of the stack beyond a defined address can then be stopped. The value of the stack pointer can be checked at the start of the interrupt service routine. If the SP points to an address outside the defined stack limits, a reset can be executed. =Data redundancy= In systems without error detection and correction units, the reliability of the system can be improved by providing protection through software. Protecting the entire memory (code and data) may not be practical in software, as it causes an unacceptable amount of overhead, but it is a software implemented low-cost solution for code segments. Another elementary requirement of digital systems is the faultless transmission of data. Communication with other components can be the weak point and a source of errors of a system. A well- thought-out transmission protocol is very important. The techniques described below can also be applied to data transmitted, hence increasing transmission reliability. Cyclic redundancy and parity check A cyclic redundancy check is a type of hash function used to produce a checksum, which is a small integer from a large block of data, such as network traffic or computer files. CRCs are calculated before and after transmission or duplication, and compared to confirm that they are equal. A CRC detects all one- or two-bit errors, all odd errors, all burst errors if the burst is smaller than the CRC, and most of the wide-burst errors. Parity checks can be applied to single characters (VRC‚Äîvertical redundancy check), resulting in an additional parity bit or to a block of data (LRC‚Äîlongitudinal redundancy check), issuing a block check character. Both methods can be implemented rather easily by using an XOR operation. A trade-off is that less errors can be detected than with the CRC. Parity Checks only detect odd numbers of flipped bits. The even numbers of bit errors stay undetected. A possible improvement is the usage of both VRC and LRC, called Double Parity or Optimal Rectangular Code (ORC). Some microcontrollers feature a hardware CRC unit. Different kinds of duplication A specific method of data redundancy is duplication, which can be applied in several ways, as described in the following: *Data duplication :To cope with corruption of data, multiple copies of important registers and variables can be stored. Consistency checks between memory locations storing the same values, or voting techniques, can then be performed when accessing the data. :Two different modifications to the source code need to be implemented. :*The first one corresponds to duplicating some or all of the program variables to introduce data redundancy, and modifying all the operators to manage the introduced replica of the variables. :*The second modification introduces consistency checks in the control flow, so that consistency between the two copies of each variable is verified. When the data is read out, the two sets of data are compared. A disturbance is detected if the two data sets are not equal. An error can be reported. If both sets of data are corrupted, a significant error can be reported and the system can react accordingly. In most cases, safety-critical applications have strict constraints in terms of memory occupation and system performance. The duplication of the whole set of variables and the introduction of a consistency check before every read operation represent the optimum choice from the fault coverage point of view. Duplication of the whole set of variables enables an extremely high percentage of faults to be covered by this software redundancy technique. On the other side, by duplicating a lower percentage of variables one can trade off the obtained fault coverage with the CPU time overhead. An experimental analysis of CPU time overhead and the amount of duplicated variables The experimental result shows that duplicating only 50% of the variables is enough to cover 85% of faults with a CPU time overhead of just 28%. Attention should also be paid to the implementation of the consistency check, as it is usually carried out after each read operation or at the end of each variable's life period. Carefully implementing this check can minimize the CPU time and code size for this application. C sample code: function parameter duplication C sample code: duplication of test conditions *Function parameter duplication As the detection of errors in data is achieved through duplicating all variables and adding consistency checks after every read operation, special considerations have to be applied according to the procedure interfaces. Parameters passed to procedures, as well as return values, are considered to be variables. Hence, every procedure parameter is duplicated, as well as the return values. A procedure is still called only once, but it returns two results, which must hold the same value. The source listing to the right shows a sample implementation of function parameter duplication. *Test duplication To duplicate a test is one of the most robust methods that exists for generic soft error detection. A drawback is that no strict assumption on the cause of the errors (EMI, ESD etc.), nor on the type of errors to expect (errors affecting the control flow, errors affecting data etc.) can be made. Erroneous bit-changes in data-bytes while stored in memory, cache, register, or transmitted on a bus are known. These data-bytes could be operation codes (instructions), memory addresses, or data. Thus, this method is able to detect a wide range of faults, and is not limited to a specific fault model. Using this method, memory increases about four times, and execution time is about 2.5 times as long as the same program without test duplication. Source listing to the right shows a sample implementation of the duplication of test conditions. *Branching duplication Branch duplication Compared to test duplication, where one condition is cross- checked, with branching duplication the condition is duplicated. For every conditional test in the program, the condition and the resulting jump should be reevaluated, as shown in the figure. Only if the condition is met again, the jump is executed, else an error has occurred. *Instruction duplication and diversity in implementation What is the benefit of when data, tests, and branches are duplicated when the calculated result is incorrect? One solution is to duplicate an instruction entirely, but implement them differently. So two different programs with the same functionality, but with different sets of data and different implementations are executed. Their outputs are compared, and must be equal. This method covers not just bit-flips or processor faults but also programming errors (bugs). If it is intended to especially handle hardware (CPU) faults, the software can be implemented using different parts of the hardware; for example, one implementation uses a hardware multiply and the other implementation multiplies by shifting or adding. This causes a significant overhead (more than a factor of two for the size of the code). On the other hand, the results are outstandingly accurate. =Ports= Reset ports and interrupt ports Reset ports and interrupts are very important, as they can be triggered by rising/falling edges or high/low potential at the interrupt port. Transient disturbances can lead to unwanted resets or trigger interrupts, and thus cause the entire system to crash. For every triggered interrupt, the instruction pointer is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer is decremented. Try to reduce the amount of edge triggered interrupts. If interrupts can be triggered only with a level, then this helps to ensure that noise on an interrupt pin will not cause an undesired operation. It must be kept in mind that level-triggered interrupts can lead to repeated interrupts as long as the level stays high. In the implementation, this characteristic must be considered; repeated unwanted interrupts must be disabled in the ISR. If this is not possible, then on immediate entry of an edge-triggered interrupt, a software check on the pin to determine if the level is correct should suffice. For all unused interrupts, an error-handling routine has to be implemented to keep the system in a defined state after an unintended interrupt. Unintentional resets disturb the correct program execution, and are not acceptable for extensive applications or safety- critical systems. Reset differentiation (cold/warm start) A frequent system requirement is the automatic resumption of work after a disturbance/disruption. It can be useful to record the state of a system at shut down and to save the data in a non-volatile memory. At startup the system can evaluate if the system restarts due to disturbance or failure (warm start), and the system status can be restored or an error can be indicated. In case of a cold start, the saved data in the memory can be considered valid. External current consumption measurement Hard- and software combination: detection of power supply fluctuation using an AD-converter This method is a combination of hard- and software implementations. It proposes a simple circuit to detect an electromagnetic interference using the device's own resources. Most microcontrollers, like the ATmega16, integrate analog to digital converters (ADCs), which could be used to detect unusual power supply fluctuations caused by interferences. When an interference is detected by the software, the microcontroller could enter a safe state while waiting for the aggression to pass. During this safe state, no critical executions are allowed. The graphic presents how interference detection can be performed. This technique can easily be used with any microcontroller that features an AD-converter. =Watchdog= A watchdog timer is an electronic timer that detects abnormal operation of other components and initiates corrective action to restore normal operation. It especially ensures that microcontroller controlled devices do not completely fail if a software error or momentary hardware error occurs. Watchdog timers are typically based on either a monostable timer or digital counter. The timer circuit may be integrated on the microcontroller chip or be implemented as an external circuit. Watchdog timers can significantly improve the reliability of a microcontroller in an electromagnetically-influenced environment. The software informs the watchdog at regular intervals that it is still working properly. If the watchdog is not informed, it means that the software is not working as specified any more. Then the watchdog resets the system to a defined state. During the reset, the device is not able to process data and does not react to calls. As the strategy to reset the watchdog timer is very important, two requirements have to be attended: *The watchdog may only be reset if all routines work properly. *The reset must be executed as quickly as possible. Simple activation of the watchdog and regular resets of the timer do not make optimal use of a watchdog. For best results, the refresh cycle of the timer must be set as short as possible and called from the main function, so a reset can be performed before damage is caused or an error occurred. If a microcontroller does not have an internal watchdog, a similar functionality can be implemented by the use of a timer interrupt or an external device. =Brown-out= A brown-out circuit monitors the VCC level during operation by comparing it to a fixed trigger level. When VCC drops below the trigger level, the brown-out reset is immediately activated. When VCC rises again, the MCU is restarted after a certain delay.

Established in 1969, Ocean Shores was originally a land holding owned by Wendell West of Washington with backing from American singer Pat Boone, and was named after Boone's residence in Ocean Shores, Washington. It is located in the Brunswick Valley ‚Äì a valley including the towns of Mullumbimby and Brunswick Heads. The town has a local shopping complex and a large golf course. At the 2016 census, Ocean Shores had a population of 5,137 people.  Climate  Ocean Shores has a subtropical climate. Summer is generally warm to hot with a few days reaching above 30 degrees. Winter is cool to mild with around two days under 14 degrees. Normal day maximums are around 20 degrees. Spring and autumn are mild to warm, with maximums around 25 and higher with few days below it. Winds come from all directions which means there are warm northerly days or mild southerly days. Spring is dry and windy. Thunderstorms are also common in summer.  Geography  Yallakool Drive A private residence Water Lily Park The beach Southern Ocean Shores is located on the edge of the Brunswick River catchment, which means most of the terrain is elevated and has terrific sea views. Northern Ocean Shores is located on mostly flat land on the beach. The north arm of the Brunswick River weaves through the north of the town. Ocean Shores Public School and Ocean Shores Pre-School are located in Ocean Shores North. A canal called 'Capriconia Canal' runs through Ocean Shores North and connects to Yelgun Creek. Most of Ocean Shores North lies next to the Billinudgel Nature Reserve. Ocean Shores is located on the New South Wales side of the New South Wales/Queensland border. Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, is closer than Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. The closest urban areas are Lismore and Tweed Heads.  Transportation  Ocean Shores has a local bus service five times per day, linking the greater Ocean Shores community, Brunswick Heads, Mullumbimby, Byron Bay and Ballina. Ocean Shores is located between two airports, Ballina to the south, which has daily flights to Sydney and Melbourne and Gold Coast to the north, which has daily services to most major Australian cities and a few international destinations. The closest closed railway station is at Mullumbimby, a 10-minute drive south. The train service travelled down the south east coast to Sydney but closed on 19 May 2004 and instead departs from Casino instead of the QLD Border.  Community and history  The people of Ocean Shores live in a coastal and estuarine environment. They experience one of the most beautiful areas of the East Coast of Australia. The area has a mix of newcomers from all over the world, as well as old timers, who have lived in the district all of their lives. Members of the Midjimbul / Durumbil clans are the traditional custodians of the area. There are Aboriginal sites in the area, including Middens along Marshalls Creek. The area is rich in indigenous heritage. The Brunswick, which included the Ocean Shores area, was the first place of European settlement in what is now called the Byron Shire, dating back to 1846. The Ocean Shores Community Association (OSCA) and its predecessors, have worked for community issues in the Ocean Shores district, since the town was founded in 1969.  Local farmers' market  The Local New Brighton Farmers‚Äô Market opens every Tuesday morning from 8 am to 11 am. The whole idea is to bring farm fresh produce to local residents, not the other way around. The market is run by a not-for- profit organisation, and supported by local producers and local people. It's relaxed, fun, and all about quality of life and the environment. The produce is mainly organically farmed and needs only to be transported a short distance, reducing transport costs and the carbon footprint.  Arts and culture  The Ocean Shores Arts Expo began in 2004 when a group of residents who had come together during the Pacific Highway planning controversy decided to create something uplifting, creative and positive for the community. Lions of Brunswick/Mullumbimby straight away supported the project as a worthy cultural event to bring community together, and provided funding and many willing hands to help. Local history has been an important corner stone of the Expo every year with our local historian Frank Mills. The Art Expo has taken place over a weekend in August every year. The next Art Expo will be in 2012. The venue is the Ocean Shores Public School, Shara Blvd, North Ocean Shores. Patrons can view art and sculpture, listen to local musicians and enjoy drinks and nibbles. Then over the weekend there are local musicians performing, art demonstrations, the Youth art show, a community artwork, and the Artists‚Äô caf√©.  Retail shopping  The Ocean Village Shopping Centre is a central meeting place for Ocean Shores residents. It has a variety of stores including a Coles supermarket, chemist, cafes, FDBs, butcher and Country Target next door. New Brighton shops include Real estate agent and holistic health centre, General store, liquor, post office and caf√©. South Golden Beach has a general store and take away caf√©. The entrance to the rural hinterland of The Pocket and Main Arm is Billinudgel. Billinudgel village has a variety of retail shops including general store, the historic Billinudgel Hotel, hot pie garden restaurant, post office, hair dresser and many others. Billinudgel also has a large industrial estate including auto repairs, storage units, Brunswick Valley bus depot, cosmetic manufacturer, gymnasium, curtain blinds factory and many others.  Business and local economy  The Ocean Shores and surrounding area established a business networking group in 2012,About Business Ashored called Business Ashored, to promote and support trade and the local economy.  Sports and outdoor  The Ocean Shores Golf Course is popular. Locals and visitors enjoy the challenge of this first class 18 hole course (No. 9 in NSW). Golf, lawn bowls, a swimming pool and excellent dining make the Ocean Shores Country Club a popular holiday venue. Golf and accommodation packages are also available. There are seven km of ocean surf beach, from the North Head of the Brunswick River to Wooyun creek. New Brighton Sports Oval and the new Ocean Shores Sportsfield, provides regular soccer practice, the home of Shores United Soccer Club, involving junior and men's teams. There are two tennis courts, outdoor gym equipment and play equipment at Waterlily Park.

She was a sister of singers Arturo Pav√≥n and Tom√°s Pav√≥n, also an important flamenco singer, and aunt to Arturo Pav√≥n, the first flamenco pianist. Both brothers, Pastora and Tom√°s, together with singer Manuel Torre, were the inspiring models for the next generation of singers like Antonio Mairena, Pepe de la Matrona or Fosforito, who led the movement towards the revival of traditional forms in the decades of the 50s-70s.  Biography  Born in the famous quarter of Alameda de H√©rcules, in Seville, she started singing for the public as at the age of 8, in the Seville Spring Fair. Later, when she was singing at Caf√© de la Marina, a caf√© cantante in Madrid, she acquired the nickname La Ni√±a de los Peines (The Girl of the Combs, a nickname she never liked), as she usually sang a stanza in tangos style with the following lyrics: Peinate t√∫ con mis peines Mis peines son de canela Comb with my combs My combs are made of cinnamon She never learned to read or write, and only learned to sing when she was already an adult. Her family were in dire need of money, so she started to sing regularly as a professional in the Taberna de Ceferino, in Seville, and then spent a period in Madrid and Bilbao. In this town, she was not allowed to sing in public owing to her young age, so she sat as model for painter Ignacio Zuloaga. Back in Andalusia, she took part in the performances of several caf√©s cantante in Jerez, Seville, M√°laga and other towns. In 1910 she made her first recordings, and in 1920 the Teatro Romea was paying her the highest fee it had ever paid to an artist. After that, she started a long series of tours in all Spain. In 1922 at Granada, she participated at the Concurso de Cante Jondo.Eduardo Molina Fajardo, Manuel de Falla y el 'Cante Jondo' (Universidad de Granada 1962, 2d ed. 1998) at 111. This famous music festival was largely organized by Manuel de Falla and also Federico Garc√≠a Lorca in order to reinvigorate the flamenco arts. She was featured as a professional performer, along with Antonio Chac√≥n, Manuel Torre, Juana la Macarrona, Ram√≥n Montoya and others. She was also chosen as one of the judges for the contest between non-professionals.√Ångel √Ålvares Caballero, El cante flamenco (Madrid: Alianza Editorial 1994) at 216. Along her career she met or shared the stage with many classical flamenco singers of the Golden Age like Antonio Chac√≥n, Manuel Torre, Francisco Lema (known as Fosforito El Viejo), La Trini, or Frijones. She had also met in 1922 Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, who, in a lecture given in 1933, stated: > This woman's voice is exceptional. It breaks the moulds of all singing > schools, as much as she breaks the moulds of any built music. When she seems > to be out of tune, she is not out of tune: on the contrary, she is > incredibly in tune as, owing to the special miracle of this style and the > passion with which she sings third tones and quarter tones, impossible to > record on the staff. (Quoted by Antonio Reina in Museo Virtual de la Ni√±a de > los Peines) In 1931, she married flamenco singer Pepe Pinto. After the parenthesis of the Spanish Civil War, she came back to the stage, as part of several flamenco shows, together with artists like Concha Piquer. After this, she retired for a few years, and came back with a show called Espa√±a y su Cantaora (Spain and her singer), together with her husband, which she toured for a few months and was acclaimed by the critics. Then she definitely retired again. In 1961 she received an homage in C√≥rdoba, in which several well-known flamenco artists took part, such as Antonio Mairena, Juan Talega, Manuel Morao, or Fernando Terremoto. In 1968, a monument was built in her honour in her quarter of Alameda de H√©rcules. In the last three years of her life, she was completely retired owing to senile dementia. She died in 1969, a month and a half after her husband. In that same year, singer Antonio Mairena recorded his album Honores a la Ni√±a de los Peines in homage to her. In 1996, during the IX Bienal de Flamenco, the autonomous Andalusian government declared the voice of La Ni√±a de los Peines Bien de Inter√©s Cultural (Asset of Cultural Interest).  Artistic legacy  A complete artist, she sang all palos to perfection, excelling especially in siguiriyas of which she preserved several styles like those of Ciego de la Pe√±a and El Marruro, which have reached our days thanks to her. She was a direct transmitter of the sol√©a of La Serneta, which she learnt directly from her author, but also left memorable recordings of many other sole√° styles like those of Enrique el Mellizo, Frijones or many other styles from Alcal√°, Triana or Jerez. Regarding her supremacy in tangos and tientos, as early as 1908, when she was only 18 years of age, a newspaper already stated: \\"La Ni√±a de los Peines is justly reputed today as the best singer for tangos. She has a beautiful voice and a delicious style. At times, when singing, she seems to be crying\\" (Quoted by Ortiz Nuevo in Museo Virtual de la Ni√±a de los Peines). Mairena and Molina ([1963] 1979:230) consider her, among the masters of tangos: \\"the supreme figure (...) singer and inexhaustible creator.\\". Her name has become inextricably linked to the peteneras and to the bambera, a folk song she turned definitely into a flamenco palo. She was also one of the main interpreters of saetas in history: \\"(\\"[As to the great interpreters of this style], in our century, Manuel Torre, Ni√±o Gloria, Pastora Pav√≥n, Tom√°s Pav√≥n, Manuel Centeno and Manuel Vallejo.\\" (Molina and Mairena [1963] 1979: 258). She was a landmark in the transformation of garrot√≠n into a completely flamenco style, and gave a definite impulse to buler√≠as: \\"Unrivalled queen of buler√≠as\\" (Molina and Mairena ([1963] 1979:263). Critics like Molina and Mairena ([1963] 1979:305), Mart√≠n Salazar (1998) also highlight her importance for palos like malague√±as, tarantas, cartageneras or grana√≠nas: \\"As we said before, Pastora was also an excellent malague√±era, who marked with her deep personality such different styles as those of Chac√≥n, El Canario, and Fernando de Triana. She also created her own malague√±a, based on the one by Maestro Ohana\\" (Mart√≠n Salazar 1998). She has been accused by a few critics of having surrendered to the fashionable trends in at the time of √≥pera flamenca, as she recorded many examples of the so-called canci√≥n por buler√≠as and cantes de ida y vuelta (both condemned by purists) and took part in theatrical shows. However, she never abandoned the more traditional flamenco songs, which form the greatest part of her discography. Even though she was a link between the traditional flamenco of the 19th century and the revival of traditional forms after the √≥pera flamenca period, as she kept many alive traditional songs and styles that were about to disappear, she was skeptical about the work of resurrection and classification of songs carried out by Antonio Mairena or Juan Talega. In her view, songs like the sole√° de la Serneta were never the same thing in the voices of different singers, and they were but outlines used as basis for singers to improvise and create. (See Lefranc 2000: 197-198) Views on La Ni√±a de los Peines  \\"In some sort of way, Pastora Pav√≥n was a revolutionary of the flamenco song, serving as link between the traditionalism of the last century and all the modernisms the current one, even the most detestable, which she did not reject without experimenting on them first, assimilating and enlarging everything that had some valuable element.\\" (√Ålvarez Caballero 1998:249) \\"We already saw, in the words of Garc√≠a Lorca, what La Ni√±a de los Peines was when she sang with duende. A sombre, agonizing angel, who surpassed all measure, who embraced all emotions (‚Ä¶).\\" (√Ålvarez Caballero 1998:250) \\"Pastora is the incarnation of flamenco singing, as Bach was of music. Geniuses of the size of this Gypsy appear in history only once in a while. She is a pontifical figure who links, through her personality, the illustrious past with the present renaissance. (...) We do not know what La Andonda, La Serrana, Mar√≠a Borrico, Merced la Serneta and many other famous women singers sang like, but it seems impossible that any of them surpassed Pastora Pav√≥n in the vastness of her repertoire, the freshness of the voice, Gypsy rajo and catching vitality.\\" (Ricardo Molina, flamecologist, quoted by R√≠os Ruiz 2002:103) \\"Among women, I have never known an artist like Pastora, and I think it will take centuries before her equal is born.\\" (Pepe de la Matrona, singer, quoted by √Ålvarez Caballero 1998:252) \\"[Referring to the singers of the √≥pera flamenca period] there remains, towering, as a challenging unique figure, Pastora Pav√≥n, La Ni√±a de los Peines, battling the fandangueros in their own territory, the theatre stages, and achieving indisputable success with the old styles of seguiriyas, soleares, malague√±as, peteneras, tarantas, tientos and buler√≠as.\\" (Mart√≠n Salazar, n.d.) \\"it can be assured that there has never been a more prolific and encyclopedic singer than Pastora. Nobody has had her flavour, nobody has been her equal.\\" (Antonio Reina in Museo Virtual de la Ni√±a de los Peines) \\"Pastora Pav√≥n Cruz, the incomparable Ni√±a de los Peines, has probably been the greatest genius in the history of [flamenco] singing. An all-style interpreter, she completely mastered the fundamental songs (seguiriyas and soleares), the festive ones (tangos, buler√≠as and canti√±as), the peteneras and the cantes de Levante (malague√±as, cartageneras, tarantas and grana√≠nas). (Mart√≠n Salazar 1998) \\"With La Ni√±a de los Peines, all discussion comes to an end: flamencologists, artists, flamenco fans, critics and everybody interested in flamenco, in general, state that she is the greatest woman singer to date.\\" (Manuel Boh√≥rquez, quoted by Antonio Reina in Museo Virtual de la Ni√±a de los Peines).

FitzRoy had already thought of the advantages of having an expert in geology on board, and sought a gentleman naturalist to accompany them as a supernumerary. At the age of 22, the graduate Charles Darwin hoped to see the tropics before becoming a parson, and accepted the opportunity. He was greatly influenced by reading Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology during the voyage. By the end of the expedition, Darwin had already made his name as a geologist and fossil collector, and the publication of his journal which became known as The Voyage of the Beagle gave him wide renown as a writer. Beagle sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys around the coasts of the southern part of South America, returning via Tahiti and Australia after having circumnavigated the Earth. While the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost five. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta in Argentina he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection. Aims of the expedition Ship's chronometer from HMS Beagle made by Thomas Earnshaw. British Museum, London. The main purpose of the expedition was to conduct a hydrographic survey of the coasts of the southern part of South America. This was a continuation and correction of the work of previous surveys, in order to produce accurate nautical charts showing navigational and sea depth information for the navy and for commerce. An Admiralty memorandum set out the detailed instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey the extent of the Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island. The real work of the survey was then to commence south of the R√≠o de la Plata, with return trips to Montevideo for supplies; details were given of priorities, including surveying Tierra del Fuego and approaches to harbours on the Falkland Islands. The west coast was then to be surveyed as far north as time and resources permitted. The commander would then determine his own route west: season permitting, he could survey the Gal√°pagos Islands. Then Beagle was to proceed to Point Venus, Tahiti, and on to Port Jackson, Australia, which were known points to verify the chronometers. No time was to be wasted on elaborate drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple views of the land as seen from the sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs. Context and preparations The previous survey expedition to South America involved HMS Adventure and HMS Beagle under the overall command of the Australian Commander Phillip Parker King. During the survey Beagle's captain, Pringle Stokes, committed suicide and command of the ship was given to the young aristocrat Robert FitzRoy, a nephew of George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton. When a ship's boat was taken by the natives of Tierra del Fuego, FitzRoy took four of them hostage. One died of smallpox, and the other three were brought back to England to be given a Christian education, with the idea that they could eventually become missionaries. After Beagle's return to Devonport dockyard on 14 October 1830, Captain King retired. The 27-year-old FitzRoy had hopes of commanding a second expedition to continue the South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed. Captain Francis Beaufort, the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, was invited to decide on the use that could be made of the voyage to continue the survey, and he discussed with FitzRoy plans for a voyage of several years, including a continuation of the trip around the world to establish median distances. Beagle was commissioned on 4 July 1831 under the command of Captain FitzRoy, who promptly spared no expense in having Beagle extensively refitted. Beagle was immediately taken into dock for extensive rebuilding and refitting. As she required a new deck, FitzRoy had the upper deck raised considerably, by aft and forward. The Cherokee-class brig-sloops had the reputation of being \\"coffin brigs\\", which handled badly and were prone to sinking. By helping the decks to drain more quickly with less water collecting in the gunnels, the raised deck gave Beagle better handling and made her less liable to become top-heavy and capsize. Additional sheathing to the hull added about seven tons to her burthen and perhaps fifteen to her displacement. The ship was one of the first to test the lightning conductor invented by William Snow Harris. FitzRoy obtained five examples of the Sympiesometer, a kind of mercury-free barometer patented by Alexander Adie and favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty. In addition to its officers and crew, Beagle carried several supernumeraries, passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle to go in a private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews. =Naturalist and geologist= For Beaufort and the leading Cambridge \\"gentlemen of science\\" the opportunity for a naturalist to join the expedition fitted with their drive to revitalise British government policy on science. This elite disdained research done for money and felt that natural philosophy was for gentlemen, not tradesmen. The officer class of the Army and Navy provided a way to ascend this hierarchy; it was commonly the Ship's Surgeon who collected specimens on voyages, and Robert McCormick had secured the official position of surgeon on Beagle after taking part in earlier expeditions and studying natural history. A sizeable collection had considerable social value, attracting wide public interest, and McCormick aspired to fame as an exploring naturalist. Collections made by the Ship's Surgeon and other officers were government property, though the Admiralty was not consistent on this, and went to important London establishments, usually the British Museum. The Admiralty instructions for the first voyage had required officers \\"to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the Public\\", but on the second voyage this requirement was omitted, and the officers were free to keep all the specimens for themselves. FitzRoy's narrative recalls that, when investigating islands on the first voyage, he had regretted that no-one on board had expertise on mineralogy or geology to make use of the opportunity of \\"ascertaining the nature of the rocks and earths\\" of the areas surveyed, and resolved that if on a similar expedition, he would \\"endeavour to carry out a person qualified to examine the land; while the officers, and myself, would attend to hydrography.\\" This clearly indicated a need for a naturalist qualified to examine geology, who would spend considerable periods onshore away from the ship. McCormick lacked expertise in geology, and had to attend to his duties on the ship. FitzRoy knew that commanding a ship could involve stress and loneliness; he was fully aware of the suicide of Captain Stokes, and his own uncle Viscount Castlereagh had committed suicide under stress of overwork. For the first time he would be fully in charge with no commanding officer or second captain to consult, and it has been suggested that he felt the need for a gentleman companion who shared his scientific interests and could dine with him as an equal. There is no direct evidence to support this. Henslow described the position \\"more as a companion than a mere collector\\", but this was an assurance that FitzRoy would treat his guest as a gentleman naturalist. Several other ships at this period carried unpaid civilians as naturalists. Early in August, FitzRoy discussed this position with Beaufort, who had a scientific network of friends at the University of Cambridge. At Beaufort's request, mathematics lecturer George Peacock wrote from London to Professor John Stevens Henslow about this \\"rare opportunity for a naturalist\\", saying that an \\"offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition\\", and suggesting the Reverend Leonard Jenyns. Though Jenyns nearly accepted, and even packed his clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck and his health, so declined. Henslow briefly thought of going, but his wife \\"looked so miserable\\" that he quickly dropped the idea. Both recommended the 22-year-old Charles Darwin who had just completed the ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree which was a prerequisite for his intended career as a parson, and was on a geology field trip with Adam Sedgwick. Offer of place to Darwin Darwin fitted well the expectations of a gentleman natural philosopher, and was well trained as a naturalist. When he had studied geology in his second year at Edinburgh he had found it dull, but from Easter to August 1831 he learned a great deal with Adam Sedgwick and developed a strong interest during their geological field trip. On 24 August Henslow wrote to Darwin: > ...that I consider you to be the best qualified person I know of who is > likely to undertake such a situation‚Äî I state this not on the supposition of > yr. being a finished Naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, > observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock > has the appointment at his disposal & if he can not find a man willing to > take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost‚Äî Capt. F. wants a man > (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector & would not take > any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as > a gentleman. ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal & > spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your > disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in > search of. The letter went first to George Peacock, who quickly forwarded it to Darwin with further details, confirming that the \\"ship sails about the end of September\\". Peacock had discussed the offer with Beaufort, \\"he entirely approves of it & you may consider the situation as at your absolute disposal\\". When Darwin returned home late on 29 August and opened the letters, his father objected strongly to the voyage so the next day he wrote declining the offer, and left to go shooting at the estate of his uncle Josiah Wedgwood II. With Wedgwood's help, Darwin's father was persuaded to relent and fund his son's expedition, and on Thursday 1 September Darwin wrote accepting Peacock's offer. That day, Beaufort wrote to tell FitzRoy that his friend Peacock had \\"succeeded in getting a 'Savant' for you‚ÄîA Mr Darwin grandson of the well known philosopher and poet‚Äîfull of zeal and enterprize and having contemplated a voyage on his own account to S. America\\". On Friday Darwin left for Cambridge, where he spent Saturday with Henslow getting advice on preparations, and references to experts. Alexander Charles Wood (an undergraduate whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to his cousin FitzRoy to recommend Darwin. Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, \\"straightforward and gentlemanlike\\" but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then \\"gave up the scheme\\". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who explained that he had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food. Darwin would be on the Admiralty's books to get provisions (worth ¬£40 a year) and, like the ship's officers and captain, would pay ¬£30 a year towards the mess bill. Including outfitting, the cost to him was unlikely to reach ¬£500. The ship would sail on 10 October, and would probably be away for three years. They talked and dined together, and soon found each other agreeable. The Tory FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of Whig background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was \\"to throw cold water on the scheme\\" in \\"a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board\\". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as \\"an ardent disciple of Lavater\\", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the phrenological basis that the shape (or physiognomy) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination. Darwin, C. R. Recollections of the development of my mind & character [Autobiography [1876-4.1882] CUL-DAR26.1‚Äì121) Transcribed by Kees Rookmaaker. Darwin Online. p. 49 Darwin's preparations While he continued to get acquainted with Fitzroy, going shopping together, Darwin rushed around to arrange his supplies and equipment, getting advice from experts on specimen preservation such as William Yarrell at the Zoological Society of London, Robert Brown at the British Museum, Captain Phillip Parker King who led the first expedition, and invertebrate anatomist Robert Edmond Grant who had tutored Darwin at Edinburgh. Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid ¬£50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent ¬£400 on firearms., On Sunday 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick, and had a pleasant \\"sail of three days\\". For the first time he saw the \\"very small\\" cramped ship, met the officers, and was glad to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes. On Friday Darwin rushed back to London, \\"250 miles in 24 hours\\", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October. Delays to Beagle gave Darwin an extra week to consult experts and complete packing his baggage. After sending his heavy goods down by steam packet, he took the coach along with Augustus Earle, and arrived at Devonport on 24 October. The geologist Charles Lyell asked FitzRoy to record observations on geological features such as erratic boulders. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods of time. In his autobiography Darwin recalled Henslow giving advice at this time to obtain and study the book, \\"but on no account to accept the views therein advocated\\". Darwin's position as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that \\"The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined to think that it would be granted\\". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for victuals until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he \\"should have no difficulty\\" as long as he \\"presented them to some public body\\" such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the \\"largest & most central collection\\", not the Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum. Darwin's work on the expedition The captain had to record his survey in painstaking paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log as well as detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring the shores of the Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness. Geology was Darwin's \\"principal pursuit\\" on the expedition and his notes on that subject were almost four times larger than his zoology notes, although he kept extensive records on both. During the voyage, he wrote to his sister that \\"there is nothing like geology; the pleasure of the first days partridge shooting or first days hunting cannot be compared to finding a fine group of fossil bones, which tell their story of former times with almost a living tongue\\". To him, investigating geology brought reasoning into play and gave him opportunities for theorising. The voyage of Beagle Voyage Charles Darwin had been told that Beagle was expected to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe on the west side of Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition. =Atlantic islands= Beagle touched at Madeira for a confirmed position without stopping. Then on 6 January it reached Tenerife in the Canary Islands, but was quarantined there because of cholera in England. Although tantalisingly near to the town of Santa Cruz, to Darwin's intense disappointment, they were denied landing. With improving weather conditions, they sailed on. On 10 January Darwin tried out a plankton net he had devised to be towed behind the ship ‚Äì only the second recorded use of such a net (after use by John Vaughan Thompson in 1816). Next day, he noted the great number of animals collected far from land and wrote \\"Many of these creatures so low in the scale of nature are most exquisite in their forms & rich colours. ‚Äî It creates a feeling of wonder that so much beauty should be apparently created for such little purpose.\\" Six days later they made their first landing at Praia on the volcanic island of Santiago in the Cape Verde Islands. It is here that Darwin's description in his published Journal begins. His initial impression was of a desolate and sterile volcanic island, but after visiting the town he came to a deep valley where he \\"first saw the glory of tropical vegetation\\" and had \\"a glorious day\\", finding overwhelming novelty in the sights and sounds. FitzRoy set up tents and an observatory on Quail Island to determine the exact position of the islands, while Darwin collected numerous sea animals, delighting in vivid tropical corals in tidal pools, and investigating the geology of Quail Island.He also collected what would in 1837 be described by John Gould as the type specimen of Passer iagoensis, the Cape Verde sparrow or Iago sparrow. Though Daubeny's book in Beagles library described the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that the structure of the Cape Verde Islands was \\"too imperfectly known\\". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at above sea level. The seashells were, as far as he could tell, \\"the same as those of present day\\". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that \\"Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. ‚Äì I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house.\\" In a letter to Henslow he wrote that \\"The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast ... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology, and later wrote of \\"seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes\\".Letter to L. Horner, Down, 29 August 1844 Customarily the ship's surgeon took the position of naturalist, and Beagles surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met at the start of the voyage, Darwin had commented that \\"My friend [McCormick] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably\\". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent \\"riding expeditions\\" with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included \\"several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.‚Äîyellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out.\\" Henslow replied that \\"The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important.\\" McCormick increasingly resented the favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame that they could be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony. Darwin had a special position as guest and social equal of the captain, so junior officers called him \\"sir\\" until the captain dubbed Darwin Philos for \\"ship's philosopher\\", and this became his suitably respectful nickname. =Surveying South America= In South America, Beagle carried out its survey work going to and fro to along the coasts to allow careful measurement and rechecking. Darwin made long journeys inland with travelling companions from the locality. He spent much of the time away from the ship, returning by prearrangement when Beagle returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections were his own and they were shipped back to Henslow in Cambridge to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the Admiralty placed in the British Museum. Tropical paradise and slavery Due to heavy surf they only stayed at Fernando de Noronha for a day to make the required observations, and Fitzroy decided to make for Bahia, Brazil, to rate the chronometers and take on water. On 28 February they reached the continent, arriving at the magnificent sight of the town now known as Salvador, with large ships at harbour scattered across the bay. On the next day, Darwin was in \\"transports of pleasure\\" walking by himself in the tropical forest, and in \\"long naturalizing walks\\" with others continued to \\"add raptures to the former raptures\\". He found the sights of slavery offensive and when FitzRoy defended the practice by describing a visit to a slaveowner whose slaves replied \\"no\\" on being asked by their master if they wished to be freed, Darwin suggested that answers in such circumstances were worthless. Enraged that his word had been questioned, FitzRoy lost his temper and banned Darwin from his company. The officers had nicknamed such outbursts \\"hot coffee,\\" and within hours FitzRoy apologised and asked Darwin to remain. Later, FitzRoy had to remain silent when Captain Paget visited them and recounted \\"facts about slavery so revolting\\" that refuted his claim. Surveying of sandbanks around the harbour was completed on 18 March, and the ship made its way down the coast to survey the extent and depths of the Abrolhos reefs, completing and correcting Roussin's survey. On 4 April they entered the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, to make observations of longitude from Villegagnon Island. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt \\"very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed in the way of my getting on shore and making collections\\" while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when Beagle left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July. Fossil finds After storms, Beagle reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, and took observations for the chronometers. An attempt to call at Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed a request for ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samboromb√≥n Bay, Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. A caricature of the scene on the quarter deck while anchored at Bahia Blanca, painted around 24 September 1832. Darwin is the central figure in a top hat, Fitzroy the second figure to his left. The watercolour is attributed to the shipboard artist Augustus Earle. At Bah√≠a Blanca, in the southern part of present Buenos Aires Province, Darwin rode inland into Patagonia with gauchos: he saw them use bolas to bring down \\"ostriches\\" (rheas), and ate roast armadillo. With FitzRoy, he went for \\"a very pleasant cruize about the bay\\" on 22 September, and about from the ship they stopped for a while at Punta Alta. In low cliffs near the point Darwin found conglomerate rocks containing numerous shells and fossilised teeth and bones of gigantic extinct mammals,; p. 109, Keynes notes the site is now under Puerto Belgrano naval base. in strata near an earth layer with shells and armadillo fossils, suggesting to him quiet tidal deposits rather than a catastrophe.'Cinnamon and port wine': an introduction to the Rio Notebook, Bah√≠a Blanca, September‚ÄîOctober 1832. With assistance (possibly from the young sailor Syms Covington acting as his servant) Darwin collected numerous fossils over several days, amusing others with \\"the cargoes of apparent rubbish which he frequently brought on board\\". Much of the second day was taken up with excavating a large skull which Darwin found embedded in soft rock, and seemed to him to be allied to the rhinoceros. On 8 October he returned to the site, and found a jawbone and tooth which he was able to identify using Bory de Saint-Vincent's Dictionnaire classique. He wrote home describing this and the large skull as Megatherium fossils, or perhaps Megalonyx, and excitedly noted that the only specimens in Europe were locked away in the King's collection at Madrid. In the same layer he found a large surface of polygonal plates of bony armour. His immediate thought was that they came from an enormous armadillo like the small creatures common in the area, but from Cuvier's misleading description of the Madrid specimen and a recent newspaper report about a fossil found by Woodbine Parish, Darwin thought that the bony armour identified the fossil as Megatherium. With FitzRoy, Darwin went about across the bay to Monte Hermoso on 19 October, and found numerous fossils of smaller rodents in contrast to the huge Edentatal mammals of Punta Alta. In November at Buenos Aires he \\"purchased fragments of some enormous bones\\" which he \\"was assured belonged to the former giants!!\\", and subsequently took any chance to get fossils \\"by gold or galloping\\". At Montevideo in November the mail from home included a copy of the second volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, a refutation of Lamarckism in which there was no shared ancestry of different species or overall progress to match the gradual geological change, but a continuing cycle in which species mysteriously appeared, closely adapted to their \\"centres of creation\\", then became extinct when the environment changed to their disadvantage. Tierra del Fuego Native of the Tierra del Fuego. They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin was taken aback at what he perceived as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, in stark contrast to the \\"civilised\\" behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being \\"without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement.\\" They appeared like \\"the representations of Devils on the Stage\\" as in Der Freisch√ºtz. In contrast, he said of Jemmy that \\"It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.\\" (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from \\"a lower form\\", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board Beagle \\"resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.\\", Beagle Diary 1832 December 18th) At the island of \\"Buttons Land\\" on 23 January 1833 they set up a mission post, with huts, gardens, furniture and crockery, but when they returned nine days later the possessions had been looted and divided up equally by the natives. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship and leaving the three civilised Fuegians to continue the missionary work. Beagle went on to the Falkland Islands arriving just after the British return. Darwin studied the relationships of species to habitats and found ancient fossils like those he had found in Wales. FitzRoy bought a schooner to assist with the surveying, and they returned to Patagonia where this was fitted with a new copper bottom and renamed Adventure. Darwin was assisted by Syms Covington in preserving specimens and his collecting was so successful that with FitzRoy's agreement he took on Covington as a full-time servant for ¬£30 a year. Gauchos, rheas, fossils and geology The two ships sailed to the R√≠o Negro in Argentina and on 8 August 1833 Darwin left on another journey inland with the gauchos. On 12 August he met General Juan Manuel de Rosas who was then leading a punitive expedition in his military campaign against native \\"Indians\\", and obtained a passport from him. As they crossed the pampas the gauchos and Indians told Darwin of a rare smaller species of rhea. After three days at Bah√≠a Blanca he grew tired of waiting for Beagle and on 21 August revisited Punta Alta where he reviewed the geology of the site in light of his new knowledge, wondering if the bones were older than the seashells. He was very successful with searching for bones, and on 1 September found a near complete skeleton with its bones still in position. He set off again and on 1 October searching the cliffs of the Carcara√±√° River found \\"an enormous gnawing tooth\\" then in a cliff of the Paran√° River saw \\"two great groups of immense bones\\" which were too soft to collect but a tooth fragment identified them as mastodons. Illness delayed him at Santa Fe, and after seeing the fossilised casing of a huge armadillo embedded in rock, he was puzzled to find a horse tooth in the same rock layer, since horses had been introduced to the continent with European migration. They took a riverboat down the Paran√° River to Buenos Aires but became entangled in a revolution as rebels allied to Rosas blockaded the city. The passport helped and with Covington he managed to escape in a boatload of refugees. They rejoined Beagle at Montevideo. As surveys were still in progress Darwin set off on another \\"galloping\\" trip in Banda Oriental to see the Uruguay River and visit the Estancia of Mr Keen near Mercedes on the R√≠o Negro. On 25 November he \\"heard of some giants bones, which as usual turned out to be those of the Megatherium\\" but could only extract a few broken fragments, then on the next day visited a nearby house and bought for about two shillings \\"a head of a Megatherium which must have been when found quite perfect\\", though the teeth had since been broken and the lower jaw had been lost. Mr Keen arranged to ship the skull down river to Buenos Aires. At Las Piedras a clergyman let him see fossils including a club-like tail which he sketched and called an \\"extraordinary weapon\\".'Banda Oriental S. Cruz.' Beagle field notebook.

Back at Montevideo, Darwin was introduced to Conrad Martens, the replacement artist brought on board Beagle after Augustus Earle had to leave due to health problems. They sailed south, putting in at Port Desire on 23 December, and the following day Darwin shot a guanaco which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised that this was the elusive smaller rhea, and preserved the remains. On 9 January 1834, further south, they reached Port St Julian and exploring the local geology in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of \\"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\\". On 26 January they entered the Straits of Magellan and at St. Gregory's Bay they met half-civilised Patagonian \\"giants\\" over tall, described by Darwin as \\"excellent practical naturalists\\". One told him that the smaller rheas were the only species this far south, while the larger rheas kept to the north, the species meeting around the Rio Negro. After further surveying in Tierra del Fuego they returned on 5 March 1834 to visit the missionaries, but found the huts deserted. Then canoes approached and they found that one of the natives was Jemmy Button, who had lost his possessions and had settled into the native ways, taking a wife. Darwin had never seen \\"so complete & grievous a change\\". Jemmy came on board and dined using his cutlery properly, speaking English as well as ever, then assured them that he \\"had not the least wish to return to England\\" and was \\"happy and contented\\", leaving them gifts of otter skins and arrowheads before returning to the canoe to join his wife. Of the first visit Darwin had written that \\"Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow creatures placed in the same world. .... It is a common subject of conjecture; what pleasure in life some of the less gifted animals can enjoy? How much more reasonably it may be asked with respect to these men\\", yet Jemmy had readily adapted to civilisation and then chosen to return to his primitive ways. This raised awkward questions; it jarred with Charles Lyell's sheltered views, expressed in volume 2 of his Principles of Geology, that human races \\"showed only a slight deviation from a common standard\\", and that acceptance of transmutation meant renouncing man's \\"belief in the high genealogy of his species\\". About this time Darwin wrote Reflection on reading my Geological notes, the first of a series of essays included in his notes. He speculated on possible causes of the land repeatedly being raised, and on a history of life in Patagonia as a sequence of named species. They returned to the Falkland Islands on 16 March just after an incident where gauchos and Indians had butchered senior members of Vernet's settlement, and helped to put the revolt down. Darwin noted the immense number of organisms dependent on the kelp forests. He received word from Henslow that his first dispatch of specimens had reached Cambridge, with the South American fossils being prized by the expert William Clift as showing hitherto unknown species and features of the Megatherium, and displayed by William Buckland and Clift before the cream of British science, making Darwin's reputation. Beagle now sailed to southern Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin set off to take boats as far as possible up the Santa Cruz river, with all involved taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back. Darwin summarised his speculation in his essay on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by Beagle's officers as well as his own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history. West coast of South America Cerro La Campana (\\"The Bell Mountain\\"), which Darwin ascended on 17 August 1834. Beagle and Adventure now surveyed the Straits of Magellan before sailing north up the west coast, reaching Chilo√© Island in the wet and heavily wooded Chilo√© Archipelago on 28 June 1834. They then spent the next six months surveying the coast and islands southwards. On Chilo√©, Darwin found fragments of black lignite and petrified wood, at least two of which the British Geological Survey discovered in 2011 locked away in their collection labeled \\"unregistered fossil plants\\". Exchanged with Joseph Dalton Hooker about ten years later, one slide was signed \\"Chiloe, C. Darwin Esq\\". They arrived at Valparaiso on 23 July. After several walks in the area, Darwin obtained horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic Andes with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on the summit of the \\"Campana or Bell\\" mountain, Cerro La Campana. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying Adventure. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia. After waiting for Darwin, Beagle sailed on 11 November to survey the Chonos Archipelago. From here they saw the eruption of the volcano Osorno in the Andes. They sailed north, and Darwin wondered about the fossils he had found. The giant Mastodons and Megatheriums were extinct, but he had found no geological signs of a \\"diluvial debacle\\" or of the changed circumstances that, in Lyell's view, led to species no longer being adapted to the position they were created to fit. He agreed with Lyell's idea of \\"the gradual birth & death of species\\" but, unlike Lyell, Darwin was willing to believe Giovanni Battista Brocchi's idea that extinct species had somehow aged and died out. Concepci√≥n after the earthquake, as drawn by Lieutenant John Clements Wickham of Beagle. They arrived at the port of Valdivia on 8 February 1835, then twelve days later Darwin was on shore when he experienced a severe earthquake and returned to find the port town badly damaged. They sailed north to Concepci√≥n, and arrived on 4 March to find that the same earthquake had devastated the city by repeated shocks and a tsunami, with even the cathedral in ruins. Darwin noted the horrors of death and destruction, and FitzRoy carefully established that mussel beds were now above high tide, giving clear evidence of the ground rising some which he confirmed a month later. They had actually experienced the gradual process of the continent emerging from the ocean as Lyell had indicated. Back in Valparaiso, Darwin set out on another trek up the Andes and on 21 March reached the continental divide at : even here he found fossil seashells in the rocks. He felt the glorious view \\"was like watching a thunderstorm, or hearing in the full Orchestra a Chorus of the Messiah.\\" After going on to Mendoza they were returning by a different pass when they found a petrified forest of fossilised trees, crystallised in a sandstone escarpment showing him that they had been on a Pacific beach when the land sank, burying them in sand which had been compressed into rock, then had gradually been raised with the continent to stand at in the mountains. On returning to Valparaiso with half a mule's load of specimens he wrote to his father that his findings, if accepted, would be crucial to the theory of the formation of the world. After another gruelling expedition in the Andes while Beagle was refitted he rejoined it and sailed to Lima, but found an armed insurrection in progress and had to stay with the ship. Here he was writing up his notes when he realised that Lyell's idea that coral atolls were on the rims of rising extinct volcanoes made less sense than the volcanoes gradually sinking so that the coral reefs around the island kept building themselves close to sea level and became an atoll as the volcano disappeared below. This was a theory he would examine when they reached such islands. =Gal√°pagos Islands= A week out of Lima, Beagle reached the Gal√°pagos Islands on 15 September 1835. The next day Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor near the site of the modern town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Chatham Island. At the location that is now known as Frigatebird Hill/Cerro Tijeretas, Darwin spent his first hour on shore in the Galapagos islands.Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. \\"Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World.\\" 2009. Princeton University Press. Darwin eagerly looked forward to seeing newly formed volcanic islands, and took every opportunity to go ashore while Beagle was methodically moved round to chart the coast. He found broken black rocky volcanic lava scorching under the hot sun, and made detailed geological notes of features including volcanic cones like chimneys which reminded him of the iron foundries of industrial Staffordshire. He was disappointed that he did not see active volcanoes or find strata showing uplift as he had hoped, though one of the officers found broken oyster-shells high above the sea on one of the islands. Abundant giant Gal√°pagos tortoises appeared to him almost antediluvian, and large black marine iguanas seemed \\"most disgusting, clumsy Lizards\\" well suited to their habitat ‚Äì he noted that someone had called them \\"imps of darkness\\". Darwin had learnt from Henslow about studying the geographical distribution of species, and particularly of linked species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents, so he endeavoured to collect plants in flower. He found widespread \\"wretched-looking\\" thin scrub thickets of only ten species, and very few insects. Birds were remarkably unafraid of humans, and in his first field note he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen on the continent. various Gal√°pagos mockingbirds Darwin caught resembled the Chilean mockingbird Mimus thenka, but differed from island to island. Beagle sailed on to Charles Island. By chance they were greeted by the Englishman Nicholas Lawson, acting Governor of Gal√°pagos for the Republic of the Equator, who accompanied them up to the penal colony. It was said that tortoises differed in the shape of the shells from island to island, and Darwin noted Lawson's statement that on seeing a tortoise he could \\"pronounce with certainty from which island it has been brought\\". Though Darwin remembered this later, he did not pay much attention at the time. However, he found a mockingbird and \\"fortunately happened to observe\\" that it differed from the Chatham Island specimen, so from then on carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught. He industriously collected all the animals, plants, insects & reptiles, and speculated about finding \\"from future comparison to what district or 'centre of creation' the organized beings of this archipelago must be attached.\\" At this stage his thoughts reflected Lyell's rejection of transmutation of species. They went on to Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet of smoke from a recently active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater.Grant, K. Thalia and Estes, Gregory B. \\"Darwin in Galapagos: Footsteps to a New World.\\" 2009 Princeton University Press. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird. After passing the northern islands of Abingdon, Tower and Bindloe, Darwin was put ashore at James Island for nine days together with the surgeon Benjamin Bynoe and their servants, and they busily collected all sorts of specimens while Beagle went back to Chatham Island for fresh water. After further surveying, Beagle set sail for Tahiti on 20 October 1835. Darwin wrote up his notes, and to his astonishment found that all the mockingbirds caught on Charles, Albemarle, James and Chatham Islands differed from island to island. He wrote \\"This birds which is so closely allied to the Thenca of Chili (Callandra of B. Ayres) is singular from existing as varieties or distinct species in the different Isds.‚Äî I have four specimens from as many Isds.‚Äî These will be found to be 2 or 3 varieties.‚Äî Each variety is constant in its own Island....\\". =Tahiti to Australia= They sailed on, dining on Galapagos tortoises, and passed the atoll of Honden Island on 9 November. They passed through the Low Islands archipelago, with Darwin remarking that they had \\"a very uninteresting appearance; a long brilliantly white beach is capped by a low bright line of green vegetation.\\" Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November he soon found interest in luxuriant vegetation and the pleasant intelligent natives who showed the benefits of Christianity, refuting allegations he had read about tyrannical missionaries overturning indigenous cultures. On 19 December they reached New Zealand where Darwin thought the tattooed MƒÅori to be savages with character of a much lower order than the Tahitians, and noted that they and their homes were \\"filthily dirty and offensive\\". He saw missionaries bringing improvement in character as well as new farming practices with an exemplary \\"English farm\\" employing natives. Richard Matthews was left here with his elder brother Joseph Matthews who was a missionary at Kaitaia. Darwin and FitzRoy were agreed that missionaries had been unfairly misrepresented in tracts, particularly one written by the artist Augustus Earle which he had left on the ship. Darwin also noted many English residents of the most worthless character, including runaway convicts from New South Wales. By 30 December he was glad to leave New Zealand. The first sight of Australia on 12 January 1836 reminded him of Patagonia, but inland the country improved and he was soon filled with admiration at the bustling city of Sydney. On a journey into the interior he came across a group of aborigines who looked \\"good-humoured & pleasant & they appeared far from such utterly degraded beings as usually represented\\". They gave him a display of spear throwing for a shilling, and he reflected sadly on how their numbers were rapidly decreasing. At a large sheep farm he joined a hunting party and caught his first marsupial, a \\"potoroo\\" (rat-kangaroo). Reflecting on the strange animals of the country, he thought that an unbeliever \\"might exclaim 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been [at] work; their object however has been the same & certainly the end in each case is complete',\\" yet an antlion he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. That evening he saw the even stranger platypus and noticed that its bill was soft, unlike the preserved specimens he had seen. Aboriginal stories that they laid eggs were believed by few Europeans. Beagle visited Hobart, Tasmania, where Darwin was impressed by the agreeable high society of the settlers, but noted that the island's \\"Aboriginal blacks are all removed & kept (in reality as prisoners) in a Promontory, the neck of which is guarded. I believe it was not possible to avoid this cruel step; although without doubt the misconduct of the Whites first led to the Necessity.\\" They then sailed to King George's Sound in south west Australia, a dismal settlement then being replaced by the Swan River Colony. Darwin was impressed by the \\"good disposition of the aboriginal blacks... Although true Savages, it is impossible not to feel an inclination to like such quiet good-natured men.\\" He provided boiled rice for an aboriginal \\"Corrobery\\" dancing party performed by the men of two tribes to the great pleasure of the women and children, a \\"most rude barbarous scene\\" in which everyone appeared in high spirits, \\"all moving in hideous harmony\\" and \\"perfectly at their ease\\". Beagles departure in a storm was delayed when she ran aground. She was refloated and got on her way. =Keeling Island homewards= FitzRoy's instructions from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20‚Äì30 fathoms (40‚Äì60 m). Arriving at Mauritius on 29 April 1836, Darwin was impressed by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor- general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain. By then FitzRoy was writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin‚Äôs diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family. Beagle reached the Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. In Cape Town Darwin received a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the Geological Society of London, and this had been reported in The Athen√¶um on 21 November. On 25 December their father received a letter from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father \\"did not move from his seat till he had read every word of your book & he was very much gratified ‚Äì he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information\\"., , Darwin was horrified that his careless words were in print, but No hay remedio (it can't be helped). He explored the geology of the area, reaching conclusions about slate formation and the injection of granite seams as liquid which differed from the ideas of Lyell and Sedgwick. The zoologist Andrew Smith showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America. Around 15 June Darwin and FitzRoy visited the noted astronomer Sir John Herschel. In his diary Darwin called this \\"the most memorable event which, for a long period, I have had the good fortune to enjoy.\\" His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage. Their discussion is not recorded, but a few months earlier, on 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his Principles of Geology as a work which would bring \\"a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated.\\" and opening a way for bold speculation on \\"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.\\" Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal \\"an inadequate conception of the Creator\\", and by analogy with other intermediate causes \\"the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\\". In Cape Town missionaries were being accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after Beagle set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote an open letter to the evangelical South African Christian Recorder on the Moral State of Tahiti incorporating extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a passing ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work. On 8 July they stopped at St. Helena for six days. Darwin took lodgings near Napoleon's tomb, and when writing to Henslow asking to be proposed for the Geological Society, mentioned his suspicions \\"that differently from most Volcanic Islds. its structure is rather complicated. It seems strange, that this little centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of recent elevation.\\" With a guide he wandered over the island, noting its complex sloping strata showing fault lines, interlaced with volcanic dykes. He examined beds high on the hill which had been taken as seashells showing that St. Helena had risen from the ocean in recent times, but Darwin identified them as extinct species of land-shells. He noted that woodland had been destroyed by goats and hogs which had run wild since being introduced in 1502, and native vegetation only predominated on high steep ridges, having been replaced by imported species. At this stage Darwin had an acute interest in island biogeography, and his description of St Helena as \\"a little centre of creation\\" in his geological diary reflects Charles Lyell's speculation in Volume 2 of Principles of Geology that the island would have acted as a \\"focus of creative force\\". He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but \\"as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind\\". When organising his Ornithological Notes between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird Mimus thenca: > These birds are closely allied in appearance to the Thenca of Chile or > Callandra of la Plata. ... In each Isld. each kind is exclusively found: > habits of all are indistinguishable. When I recollect, the fact that the > form of the body, shape of scales & general size, the Spaniards can at once > pronounce, from which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see > these Islands in sight of each other, & [but del.] possessed of but a scanty > stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in > structure & filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they are only > varieties. > The only fact of a similar kind of which I am aware, is the constant > asserted difference ‚Äì between the wolf-like Fox of East & West Falkland > Islds. > If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of > Archipelagoes ‚Äì will be well worth examining; for such facts [would > inserted] undermine the stability of Species. The term \\"would\\" before \\"undermine\\" had been added after writing what is now noted as the first expression of his doubts about species being immutable, which led to him becoming convinced about the transmutation of species and hence evolution. In opposing transmutation, Lyell had proposed that varieties arose due to changes in environment, but these varieties lived in similar conditions though each on its own island. Darwin had just reviewed similar inconsistencies with mainland bird genera such as Pteroptochos. Though his suspicions about the Falkland Island fox may have been unsupported, the differences in Gal√°pagos tortoises between islands were remembered, and he later wrote that he had been greatly struck from around March 1836 by the character of South American fossils and of species on the Galapagos Archipelago, noting \\"These facts origin (especially latter) of all my views\\". Beagle reached Ascension Island on 19 July 1836, and Darwin was delighted to receive letters from his sisters with news that Sedgwick had written \\"He is doing admirably in S. America, & has already sent home a Collection above all praise.‚Äî It was the best thing in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery‚Äî There was some risk of his turning out an idle man: but his character will now be fixed, & if God spare his life, he will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe.\\" Darwin later recalled how he \\"clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!.\\" He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that \\"We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder\\", and noted the care taken to sustain \\"houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain\\". (In the 1840s Darwin worked with Hooker, who proposed in 1847 that the Royal Navy import tree species, a project started in 1850 which led to the creation of an artificial cloud forest on what is now Green Mountain.) On 23 July they set off again longing to reach home, but FitzRoy wanted to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements and so took the ship across the Atlantic back to Bahia in Brazil to take check readings. Darwin was glad to see the beauties of the jungle for a last time, but now compared \\"the stately Mango trees with the Horse Chesnuts of England.\\" The return trip was delayed for a further 11 days when weather forced Beagle to shelter further up the coast at Pernambuco, where Darwin examined rocks for signs of elevation, noted \\"Mangroves like rank grass\\" and investigated marine invertebrates at various depths on the sandbar. Beagle departed for home on 17 August. After a stormy passage including a stop for supplies at the Azores, the Beagle finally reached England on 2 October 1836, and anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall. A plaque now commemorates this arrival point in Falmouth. Return In 1837 HMS Beagle set off on a survey of Australia, shown here in an 1841 watercolour by Owen Stanley. On the stormy night of 2 October 1836, immediately after arriving in Falmouth, Darwin set off on the mail coach, and arrived late at night on 4 October 1836 at The Mount House, the family home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Darwin apparently went straight to bed, and greeted his family at breakfast. After ten days of catching up with family he went on to Cambridge and sought Henslow's advice on organising the description and cataloguing of his collections. Darwin's father gave him an allowance that enabled him to put aside other careers, and as a scientific celebrity with a reputation established by his fossils and Henslow's publication of his letters on South American geology, he toured London's society institutions. By this time he was part of the \\"scientific establishment\\", collaborating with expert naturalists to describe his specimens, and working on ideas he had been developing during the voyage. Charles Lyell gave him enthusiastic backing. In December 1836, Darwin presented a talk to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He wrote a paper proving that Chile, and the South American continent, was slowly rising, which he read to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837. Darwin thought of having his diary published mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839. Syms Covington stayed with Darwin as his servant, then on 25 February 1839 (shortly after Darwin's marriage) Covington parted on good terms and migrated to Australia. Expert publications on Darwin's collections Darwin had shown great ability as a collector and had done the best he could with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered taxonomic decisions on defining and naming new species. =Fossils= Richard Owen had expertise in comparative anatomy and his professional judgements revealed a succession of similar species in the same locality, giving Darwin insights which he would later recall as being central to his new views. Owen met Darwin on 29 October 1836 and quickly took on the task of describing these new fossils. At that time the only fully described fossil mammals from South America were three species of Mastodon and the gigantic Megatherium. On 9 November Darwin wrote to his sister that \\"Some of them are turning out great treasures.\\" The near complete skeleton from Punta Alta was apparently very closely allied to anteaters, but of the extraordinary size of a small horse. The rhinoceros sized head bought for two shillings near Mercedes was not a megatherium, but \\"as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size‚Äî What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!\\" A Scelidotherium skeleton in Paris. Over the following years Owen published descriptions of the most important fossils, naming several as new species. He described the fossils from Punta Alta as including a nearly perfect head and three fragments of heads of Megatherium Cuvierii, the jaw of a related species which Owen named Mylodon Darwinii, and jaws of Megalonyx Jeffersonii. The near complete skeleton was named Scelidotherium by Owen, who found it had most of its bones nearly in their proper relative positions. At the nearby Monte Hermoso beds the numerous rodents included species allied to the Brazilian tuco-tuco and the capybara. Owen decided that the fossils of polygonal plates of bony armour found at several locations were not from the Megatherium as Cuvier's description implied, but from a huge armadillo as Darwin had briefly thought. Owen found a description of an earlier unnamed specimen which he named Glyptodon clavipes in 1839. Darwin's find from Punta Alta, a large surface about doubled over with toe bones still inside the folded armour, was identified as a slightly smaller Glyptodont named Hoplophorus by Lund in the same year. The huge skull from near Mercedes was named Toxodon by Owen, and he showed that the \\"enormous gnawing tooth\\" from the cliffs of the Carcara√±√° River was a molar from this species. The finds near Mercedes also included a large fragment of Glyptodont armour and a head which Owen initially identified as a Glossotherium, but later decided was a Mylodon. Owen found fragments of the jaw and a tooth of another Toxodon in the fossils from Punta Alta. The fossils from near Santa Fe included the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin as it had been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse. The \\"soft as cheese\\" Mastodon bones at the Paran√° River were identified as two gigantic skeletons of Mastodon andium, and mastodon teeth were also identified from Santa Fe and the Carcara√±√° River. The pieces of spine and a hind leg from Port S. Julian which Darwin had thought came from \\"some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon\\" gave Owen difficulties, as the creature which he named Macrauchenia appeared to be a \\"gigantic and most extraordinary pachyderm\\", allied to the Palaeotherium, but with affinities to the llama and the camel. The fossils at Punta Alta included a pachyderm tooth which was thought probably came from Macrauchenia.

Covey, who spoke Mende and possibly other African languages as well as English, was instrumental for enabling the Mende passengers of the Amistad to communicate with the court and to defend themselves successfully against charges of mutiny and murder.  Early life  Covey was born circa 1825 or 1826 in the southwestern highlands of what is now Sierra Leone, in West Africa. His African name, Kaweli, means \\"war road\\" in Mende. At the age of five or six, he was kidnapped in a raid and sold to the wife of a chief of the Bulom tribe. Three years later he was sold to a European slaver and probably taken to the Lomboko slave camp before transport to the Americas. At a time when the Atlantic slave trade had already been officially outlawed, Covey was illegally shipped to Cuba on board the Spanish ship Segundo Socorro. That ship was intercepted by the British fleet and the captives, including Covey, were freed. Covey was put into the care of the Rev. John William Weeks, of the Freetown branch of the Church Missionary Society. He spent five years at school in Freetown before joining the British Royal Navy. In 1838 he joined the crew of , where he served under Captain Charles Fitzgerald. Covey arrived in New York City on board Buzzard in June 1839.  Involvement with the Amistad case  Josiah Gibbs, a professor of linguistics at Yale University who was personally committed to the abolition of slavery, sought to assist the legal defense of the Africans who had come into the custody of the U.S. federal courts after their uprising on board La Amistad. To that end, Prof. Gibbs learned to count to ten in the language spoken by most of the Africans, which turned out to be Mende. He went around the harbor in New Haven and later in New York, counting aloud, until he was approached by sailors who recognized the words. In this way, Gibbs came into contact with Covey and fellow British sailor Charles Pratt in New York, in October 1839. Gibbs took both Covey and Pratt to New Haven, where they were housed under the protection of Lewis Tappan and the committee for the defense of the captives of the Amistad. Covey stayed in New Haven for four months, until he had translated the testimonies of three Mende-speaking captives in the Amistad civil trial in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1841. Because of his own experience, Covey was instrumental in interpreting and communicating the details of the kidnapping, terror, and eventual rebellion. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in United States v. The Amistad that the captives were not slaves, but freeborn men and had legally defended themselves in gaining their freedom.  Later life  In November 1841, Covey, along with the 35 Africans of the Amistad, who chose to return to Africa, boarded the ship Gentleman for the voyage. Funds had been raised for them from private sources. The Africans were accompanied to Freetown by an American missionary, William Raymond. Covey appeared to drift in and out of the Christian missionary communities in Sierra Leone. There is some evidence that he became involved with a local warlord and may have participated in a slaving expedition in 1845. After falling ill, he was shuffled back and forth between the village of Kaw-Mendi and the main mission compound, \\"America\\". Covey died on 12 October, 1850 and was given a Christian burial.  In popular culture  In Steven Spielberg's drama film Amistad (1997), Covey is played by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Swimming in the pool below the waterfall is highly discouraged because there is a threat of becoming infected with Leptospirosis. This disease causes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that can last for up to 1 to 2 weeks. Many tourists are attracted to the waterfall and the scenery throughout the Manoa falls trail leading up to it. Another attraction near Manoa Falls is the Lyon Arboretum. The Lyon Arboretum preserves many endangered Hawaiian plant species. The hike to Manoa Falls and back is around a one-hour round trip. The waterfall and surrounding area experiences rainfall almost everyday, and flash floods are also possible.  Characteristics  Manoa Falls is located on the island of Oahu in Honolulu, Hawaii in Manoa Valley. The Manoa Falls is a 150 foot waterfall that empties into a small pool of water. The waterfall is nestled in the mountains of Koolau in a tropical rainforest. Since the area surrounding the waterfall is considered a tropical rainforest, it is prone to heavy rainfall often making the ground damp and muddy The high amount of precipitation leads to a high amount of plant life near the falls. There is often less water in the waterfall during the summer months, which leaves peak tourism extending from summer to fall, before the rainy months of November‚ÄìMarch.  Dangers  = Leptospirosis = Swimming in the pool at the bottom of the falls is discouraged. This is due both to occasional rockfalls and to the bacterial disease called Leptospirosis, which causes severe flu-like symptoms. Leptospirosis is found in freshwater and is common in tropical climates. In Hawaii, rats and mice often carry the disease and can easily transfer it to humans through their urine. = Deaths = A 19 year old valedictorian from Kaiser High School, in Honolulu, Hawaii, died from falling from the top of Manoa Falls on June 15, 2016. Kirsti Takanishi died two days after the incident and the cause of death was determined to be from blunt force trauma to the head. A 27 year old man died from falling from the top of Manoa Falls on December 17th, 2018. The man's name has yet to be released. Phillip Scott Mann fell from the top of the falls and died on April 11th 2012 his body wasn't found until around 2p.m. the following day April 12th. Cause of death was blunt force trauma from the almost 200ft fall. Phillip was from Scottsmoor,Florida and moved to Hawaii in 2011.  Ecology  The Lyon Arboretum is located in the Manoa Valley section of the Manoa Falls Trail. It contains over 5000 plant species. Some plant species included are heliconias, gingers, aroids, bromeliads, and some native Hawaiian plants. Many tourists visit the arboretum but some also go for research and academic purposes. It provides several different programs that develop innovations to restore endangered native Hawaiian plants. Ginger Plant found in the Lyon Arboretum.  Parking  Parking is available at the base of the park, at the end on the Manoa Road. Charge is $5 per car. You have to get a parking ticket from an attendant, then go inside and pay for it.

The Tafel equation was first deduced experimentally and was later shown to have a theoretical justification.

Also, at a given electrode the Tafel equation assumes that the reverse half reaction rate is negligible compared to the forward reaction rate. Overview of the terms The exchange current is the current at equilibrium, i.e. the rate at which oxidized and reduced species transfer electrons with the electrode. In other words, the exchange current density is the rate of reaction at the reversible potential (when the overpotential is zero by definition). At the reversible potential, the reaction is in equilibrium meaning that the forward and reverse reactions progress at the same rates. This rate is the exchange current density. The Tafel slope is measured experimentally. It can, however, be shown theoretically that when the dominant reaction mechanism involves the transfer of a single electron that : \\\\frac{\\\\lambda kT}{e} < A where A is defined as where * \\\\lambda=\\\\ln(10)=2.302585... * k is Boltzmann's constant, * T is the absolute temperature, * e is the electric elementary charge of an electron, * V_T=kT/e is the thermal voltage, and * \\\\alpha is the \\"charge transfer coefficient\\", the value of which must be between 0 and 1.

He was appointed a gentleman of horse to the Prince and Princess of Denmark (Princess Anne, later Queen Anne), in 1690; a position he resigned in February 1692/3. Lord Lexington supported in the House of Lords the elevation of William of Orange to the throne, and was employed by that king at court and on diplomatic business, being sent as envoy extraordinary to the Elector of Brandenburg in 1689. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor on 17 March 1692, and was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King William from 1692 until 1702. Lexington was again sent abroad in 1694 as envoy extraordinary to the Court in Vienna, and served until the Treaty of Ryswick was concluded in 1697. He was a Lord of Trade from 1699 to 1702, and ambassador to the Court of Madrid from 1712 until 1713, during negotiations for the Treaty of Utrecht. His appointment to the Privy Council was not renewed upon the accession of George I in 1714. He was sent abroad for the last time in 1718, as minister at Vienna. He died on 10 September 1723. His letters from Vienna, selected and edited by the Hon. H. M. Sutton, were published as the Lexington Papers (1851). Lexington's barony became extinct on his death, but his estates descended to Lord Robert and Lord George Manners- Sutton, the younger sons of his daughter Bridget and her husband John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland.

It was discovered on 31 January 1924, by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid is named after the Azalea flower.  Orbit and classification  Azalea is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,216 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in April 1928, more than 4 years after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Azalea is a common stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In 2004, two rotational lightcurves of Azalea were obtained from photometric observations by a group of predominately Polish astronomers including Agnieszka Kryszczy≈Ñska, as well as by astronomers Alain Klotz and Raoul Behrend. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 15.03 and 15.15 hours with a high brightness variation of 0.70 and 0.79 magnitude, respectively (). The high brightness amplitude is typically indicative for a non-spheroidal shape. = Spin axis = In 2013, an international study modeled a lightcurve with a concurring period of 15.0276 hours and found two spin axis of (252.0¬∞, 51.0¬∞) and (64.0¬∞, 41.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤) (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Azalea measures between 10.66 and 13.07 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.223 and 0.34. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of the Flora family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 12.40 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the genus of flowering shrubs, Azalea, which are rhododendrons with funnel-shaped corollas. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

To avoid bankruptcy, the Continental Congress eliminated $195 million of its $200 million debt by fiat. After the American Revolutionary War, the Continental currency, called \\"Continentals,\\" would be deemed worthless. Continental One Third Dollar Note (obverse) With its finances in disarray, the legislature abdicated its fiscal responsibilities by shifting them to the 13 states. When the state legislatures failed to meet quotas for war material by local taxation, Patriot armies turned to confiscating supplies from farmers and tradesmen, compensating them with IOUs of uncertain value.Staloff, 2005, p. 69-70 By the end of the war, over $90 million in state debt was outstanding.Staloff, 2005, p. 70 Much of the state and national fiscal disorder, exacerbated by an economic crisis in urban commercial centers,Hofstadter, 1957, p. 125 had remained unresolved when the Report was issued.Ellis, 2000, p. 61 Funding of national debt With ratification of the US Constitution in 1787,Miller, 1960, p. 14 Congress could impose import duties and levy taxes for the raising of revenue to honor those financial obligations.Malone, 1960, p. 256 The US national debt, according to the Report, included $40 million in domestic debt and $12 million in foreign debt, both of which were inherited from the Continental Congress.Smith, 198, p. 147Staloff, 2005, p. 91-92 In addition, the 13 states altogether owed $25 million from debts incurred during the American Revolution. The combined US debt, as calculated, stood at $77 million.Staloff, 2005, p. 92Ellis, 2000, p. 55 A consensus arose in Congress for the primary source of revenue to be tariff and tonnage duties,Miller, 1960, p. 15Malone, 1957, p. 256 which would serve to cover operating expenses for the central government and to pay interest and principal on foreign and domestic debt. Under the guidance of US Representative James Madison, who led the House,Miller, 1960, p. 33 a tariff act was passed on July 4, 1789. Congress created the executive departments in September 1789, and Alexander Hamilton was confirmed by the Senate to regulate the powerful Treasury Department.Malone, 1957, p. 257 Madison, having \\"actively promoted\\" Hamilton's appointment,Miller, 1960, p. 36 was expected to co-operate in creating an energetic central government.Miller, 1960, p. 35 Schemes to establish public credit: repudiation discrimination, redemption  Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806 With sources of revenue legislated, Congress proceeded to address the pressing issue of public credit.Miller, 1960, p. 36-37, Malone, 1957, p. 259, Establishing government credit, the government's ability to borrow, was deemed a necessity if the nation was to endure. To convince investors to purchase US securities, a system was needed for the reliable payment of interest. Considering the magnitude of the debt burden that it had inherited,Miller, 1960, p. 14, p. 38 Congress wished to dispose of it with economy, and \\"the only real difference of opinion... was how much of the existing debt had to be redeemed in order to establish the government credit.\\" Various plans had been considered to pay down the domestic debt under the new federal government. Some advocates wanted to scale back the debt to ease tax burdens abruptly to retire the debt quickly. Proposals to default on the loans were termed partial or full \\"repudiation.\\" None of them, however, suggested defaulting on any portion of the $12 million foreign debtBrock, 1957, p. 41, Burstein, 2010, p. 214, with $1.5 million in interestMiller, 1960, p. 38, which was regarded as a \\"sacred obligation [to be] paid in full.\\" A significant portion of the nation's $40 million domestic debt was owed to Patriots who had supported the War of Independence by loans or personal service. Many of them were combat veterans who, during demobilization in 1783, had been paid in IOUs, \\"certificates of indebtedness\\"Malone, 1960, p. 260, Brock, 1957, p. 41 or \\"securities\\" (not to be confused with the worthless Continental currency or bills of credit) and redeemable when the government's fiscal order had been restored. Schemes more in sympathy with the ex-soldiers who had relinquished their certificates to speculators at reduced rates were termed \\"discrimination\\" and called for paying the original holder of the security at full value and for reimbursing the current holder of the security at its purchase price. The combined payments would, however, exceed the denomination of the original certificate.Brock, 1957, p. 41-42 US Representative James Madison of Virginia offered his own variation of \\"discrimination\\" that would preserved the federal obligation of face value debt repayment. In his version, current certificate holders would be reimbursed at their purchase price for the devalued certificate, and the balance would be handed to the original holder. The government outlay would match the face value of the original certificate. Hamilton rejected both \\"repudiation\\" and \\"discrimination\\" and championed \\"redemption,\\" the reserving of payment at full value strictly to the current holders of the certificates, with arrears of interest.Malone, 1960, p. 259 Near the close of the first session of the 1st Congress in September 1789, with the matter of establishing public credit unresolved, the legislature directed the new Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, to prepare a report on credit.Malone, 1957, p. 259, Miller, 1960, p. 39 Political debate over Hamilton's \\"Redemption\\" James Madison Hamilton's First Report on the Public Credit was delivered to Congress on January 9, 1790. It called for payment in full on all government debts as the foundation for establishing government credit.Miller, 1960, p. 39 Hamilton argued that to be required for the creation of a favorable climate for investment in government securities and for the transformation of the public debt to a source of capital.Staloff, 2005, p. 93 His model was the British financial system, which absolutely required fidelity to creditors.Miller, 1960, p. 40 Before the government could resume borrowing, Hamilton insisted for the $13 million in arrears of interest to be converted into principal, with payments at 4% on reissued securities.Staloff, 2005, p. 92-93, Brock, 1957, p. 39 The plan would be funded by pledging a portion of the government tariff and tonnage revenue irrevocably to the payment schedule.Miller, 1960, p. 39-40 Additionally, contracted debt would be serviced by sinking funds derived from postal service revenue that was earmarked for that purpose. Rather than seeking to liquidate the national debt, Hamilton recommended for government securities to be traded at par to promote their exchange as legal tender equivalent in value to hard currency. Regular payments of the public debt would allow Congress to increase federal money supply safely, which would stimulate capital investments in agriculture and manufacturing. With economic prosperity, the enterprises would more easily carry their tax burdens and provide the revenue to service the national debt.Staloff, 2005, p. 94 Monied speculators, alerted that Congress, under the new Constitution, might provide for payment at face value for certificates, sought to buy up devalued securities for profit and investment.Ellis, 2000, p. 56, Brock, 1957, p. 42, Miller, 1960, p. 44 Concerns arose since many certificates, almost three quarters of themStaloff, 2005, p. 92-93, had been exchanged for well below par during periods of inflation,Ellis, 2000, p. 55-56 some as low as 10 cents on the dollar,Burstein, 2010, p. 214 but they sold at 20-25% while the Report was debated.Malone, 1960, p. 260, Staloff, 2005, p. 92 When the report was made public in January 1790, speculators in Philadelphia and New York sent buyers by ship to southern states to buy up securities before the South became aware of the plan. Devalued certificates were relinquished by holders at low rates even after the news had been received, which reflected the widely-held conviction in the South that the credit and assumption measures would be defeated in Congress. The value of government certificates continued to fall months after Hamilton's scheme was published, and \\"the sellers speculated upon the purchasers.\\"Miller, 1960, p. 44-45 US Representative James Madison led a vigorous opposition to Hamilton's \\"redemption\\"Ellis, 2000, p. 56Burstein, 2010, p. 214-215 but fully supported the development of good credit. In his address to the House on February 11, 1790, Madison characterized Hamilton's \\"redemption\\" as a formula to defraud \\"battle-worn veterans of the war for independence\\" and a handout to well-to-do speculators, mostly rich Northerners, including some members of Congress.Burstein, 2010, p. 214, Brock, 1957, p. 42, Miller, 1960, p. 42 Madison's \\"discrimination\\" promised to correct those abuses in the names of financial rectitude and natural justice. Introducing political rhetoric into the debate that resonated with his home state of Virginia,Brock, 1957, p. 45 Madison laid the groundwork for a national party for democrats.Brock, 1957, p. 46 His principled opposition to \\"redemption\\" was consistent with his view of a federal government designed to shield the less powerful from a majority interest, in this case his agrarian constituency, from Federalist-sponsored economic nationalism.Brock, 1957, p. 46, Miller, 1960, p. 41, The essence of Hamilton's economic position on \\"redemption\\" was that any compromise on the sanctity of promissory notes would undermine confidence in creditBrock, 1957, p. 42, Ellis, 2000, p. 62 and that concentrating capital into fewer hands would strengthen commercial investment and encourage constructive economic growth,Miller, 1960, p. 53 which would enlarge government credit available to business enterprises.Ellis, 2000, p. 56, Miller, 1960, p. 41, Brock, 1957, p. 43 As Hamilton's plan would greatly simplify and streamline finances, he found Madison's concern over the question of honoring both original and present holders of government securities na√Øve and counterproductive.Ellis, 2000, p. 61, Miller, 1960, p. 41, Staloff, 2005, p. 95 Adopting a much-broader view of the effects of speculation, Hamilton acknowledged that many certificates had been obtained by wealthy individuals, but he considered the \\"few great fortunes\\" of minor significance and a \\"necessary evil\\" in the transition to sound credit.Malone, 1960, p. 260, Brock, 1957, p. 43 His object was \\"to serve the nation, not to enrich a clique,\\" and to establish faith in the national currency to avoid bankruptcy.Brock, 1957, p. 43 Ultimately, he wished to unleash the vast productive potential he perceived as part of America's destiny.Brock, 1957, p. 52, Ellis, 2000, p. 61, p. 63, Staloff, 2005, p. 85, p. 86 In promoting the utility of his program, however, Hamilton had neglected to address popular perceptions of injustices to wartime patriots by postwar speculation.Ellis, 2000, p. 61, Brock, 1957, p. 39 p. 41-42 The Federalists, yoking their political fortunes to the financial elites,Ellis, 2000, p. 64 failed to cultivate their natural political base: \\"small businessmen and conservative farmers.\\"Brock, 1957, p. 44 Hamilton confessed years later that \\"the Federalists have... erred in relying so much on the rectitude and utility of their measures, as to have neglected the cultivation of popular favor, by fair and justifiable expedients.\\"Brock, 1957, p. 39 Congress rejected Madison's \\"discrimination\\" in favor of Hamilton's \\"redemption\\" by 36 to 13 in the House of Representatives, which preserved the sanctity of contracts as the cornerstone establishing confidence in public credit.Malone, 1960, p. 260, Staloff, 2005, p. 96, Miller, 1960, p. 43 Madison's defeat, however, established his reputation \\"as a friend of the common man.\\"Miller, 1960, p. 43 \\"Assumption:\\" shifting state debt to federal government The key provision in Hamilton's fiscal reform was termed \\"assumption\\" and called for the 13 states to consolidate their outstanding debt of $25 millionEllis, 2000, p. 55, Varon, 2008, p. 31, and to transfer it to the federal government for servicing under a general funding plan.Ellis, 2000, p. 55, Staloff, 2005, p. 92, p. 96 Hamilton's chief objectives were both economic and political.Brock, 1957, p. 42Miller, 1969, p. 39 Economically, state securities were vulnerable to local fluctuations in value and thus to speculative buying and selling, activities that would threaten the integrity of a national credit system.Brock, 1957, p. 42, Ellis, 2000, p. 57 Furthermore, with each state legislature formulating separate repayment plans, the federal government would be forced to compete with states for sources of tax revenue. Hamilton's \\"assumption\\" promised to obviate those conflicts.Staloff, 2005, p. 92, p. 96 Politically, Hamilton sought to \\"tie the creditors to the new [central] government\\"Smith, 1980, p. 147 by linking their financial fortunes to the success of his economic nationalism.Brock, 1957, p. 42, Miller, 1960, Staloff, 2005, p. 96 That would, in turn, gradually cause a decline in state authority and a relative increase in federal influence.Miller, 1960, p. 41 Agrarian opposition to \\"assumption\\" Hamilton's funding scheme and \\"redemption\\" had won relatively- quick approval,Staloff, 2005, p. 96, p. 312 but \\"assumption\\" was stalled by bitter resistance from southern legislators, led by James Madison.Ellis, 2000, p. 48 One of the effects of \\"assumption\\" would be to distribute the collective debt burden among all the states, the more solvent members paying a share of the more indebted ones.Smith, 1980, p. 148, Miller, 1960, p. 46 Most of the southern states, except for South Carolina, had successfully paid down the bulk of their wartime debt.Malone, 1960, p. 260, Ellis, 2000, p. 57 Virginia, relatively debt-free, led the fight against 'assumption.\\" Madison argued that the proposed national tax would overburden Virginia planters operating on a narrow margin of profit.Ellis, 2000, p. 65 Requiring solvent states to contribute to states suspected of mismanaging their fiscal affairs was deemed unjust.Brock, 1957, p. 42, Ellis, 2000, p. 57, Burstein & Isenberg, 2010, p. 216 Before any vote on \\"assumption,\\" Madison insisted on a balancing of state accounts, termed \\"settlement,\\" to determine the burden that each state would be compelled to contribute under the plan. He calculated that under Hamiliton's plan, Virginia would be responsible for providing $5 million in new federal revenue, but the federal government would assume only $3 million of Virginia's debt.Ellis, 2000, p. 58, Miller, 1960, p. 46-47 In surrendering their debt into the hands of the Treasury Department, the states would sanction the principle of collective decision-making at the national level on state matters and \\"enormously strengthen\\" the influence of the federal government.Brock, 1957, p. 42, Ellis, 2000, p. 58, Burstein & Isenberg, 2010, p. 214-215 At the heart of the opposition lay a political fear of \\"consolidation,\\" with power and wealth concentrated in fewer hands and the states \\"absorbed by the new federal government.\\"Ellis, 2000, p. 59 Madison and his majority in the House blocked passage of the legislation on \\"assumption\\" in a test vote in April.Malone, 1960, p. 261 Subsequent votes ended in rejection and had brought \\"the business of Congress to a standstill\\" by June 1790.Staloff, 2005, p. 312, Miller, 1960, p. 47 \\"Residency,\\" \\"assumption,\\" and \\"dinner-table bargain\\" The US Constitution had provided for the establishment of a permanent \\"seat of government,\\" a national capital, without designating a location.Ellis, 2000, p. 69 New York City served as a temporary site to conduct federal affairs until a permanent \\"residence\\" could be agreed upon.Ellis, 2000, p. 67 Intense Congressional debates arose over the \\"residency question\\" and resulted in proposals identifying 16 possible sites in competing states, none of which could muster majority support.Malone, 1960, 261 A number of government officials and state delegations gathered in clandestine meetings and political dinnersMiller, 1960, p. 48 to resolve the stalled \\"assumption\\" bill by linking the \\"residency\\" debate to passage of Hamilton's financial program.Ellis, 2000, p.50,p 72 Thomas Jefferson, who recently returned from France, where he had acted as a foreign diplomat, understood the practical necessity of Hamilton's fiscal goals establishing America's legitimacy throughout Europe's financial centers.Ellis, 2000, p. 68 As the newly-appointed Secretary of State, Jefferson invited Hamilton to meet privately with the opposition leader James Madison in an effort to broker a compromise on \\"assumption\\" and \\"residence.\\"Staloff, 2005, p. 96, p. 313Ellis, 2000, p. 48-49 The \\"dinner-party bargain\\"Burstein & Isenberg, 2010, p. 218Ellis, 2000, p. 49 made Madison withdraw his opposition and permit passage of the Assumption Bill.Miller, 1960, p. 49 For his part, Hamilton agreed to suppress opposition for the permanent location of the nation's capital at Georgetown on the Potomac, the present site of Washington, DC.Staloff, 2005, p. 313 Hamilton's support was superfluous, as the Potomac location had already been secured.Ellis, 2000, p. 73 Jefferson and Madison acquiesced in the passage of \\"assumption\\" as an expedient to avoid government bankruptcy and disunion,Varon, 2008, p. 31Ellis, 2000, p. 50-51, p. 78 not because they condoned Hamilton's economic nationalism.Staloff, 2005, p. 313 Jefferson's \\"dinner-party\\" was in fact \\"the final chapter in an ongoing negotiation that [succeeded] because the ground had already been prepared\\"Burstein & Isenberg, 2010, p.218 - 219 and produced \\"the first great compromise of the new federal government.\\" Jefferson and Madison extracted a major concession from Hamilton in the recalculation of Virginia's debt under the fiscal plan.Staloff, 2005, p. 96-97 A zero-sum arrangement was contrived in which Virginia would pay $3.4 million to the federal government and receive exactly that amount in federal compensation. The revision of Virginia 's debt, coupled with Potomac residence, ultimately netted it over $13 million.Staloff, 2005, p. 96, p. 313, Ellis, 2000, p. 73-74 Indifferent to agrarian hostility to his economic proposals,Brock, 1957, p. 42, Hamilton had \\"[driven] into alliance two very different trends of opinion: the \\"gentlemen planters\\" cherished local autonomy and limited government enlisted the support of lower-middle class, and \\"artisans and western farmers\\" favored democratic government and majority rule.Hofstadter, 1948, p. 14-15 Those forces, one with Republican commitments, the other with Democratic convictions, united in common cause against Hamilton's reforms and \\"laid the basis for a national party.\\"Malone, 1960, p. 260, Brock, 1957, p. 45, Staloff, 2005, p. 313 The Residence Bill passed in the House by a vote of 32 to 29 on July 9, 1790, and the Assumption Bill cleared by a vote of 34 to 28 on July 26, 1790.Ellis, 2000, p. 50, Smith, 1980, p. 154 Administration and performance The adoption of Hamilton's report had the immediate effect of converting what had been virtually- worthless federal and state certificates of indebtedness to $60 million of funded government securities.Miller, 1960, p. 50 The fully-funded central government regained the ability to borrow and attracted foreign investment as social unrest destabilized Europe. In addition, the newly-issued bonds provided a circulating currency and stimulated business investment. Hamilton submitted a schedule of excise taxes on December 13, 1790 Staloff, 2006, p. 97 to augment revenue necessary to service debts assumed from the states.Miller, 1960, p. 155 The national debt reached $80 million and required nearly 80% of annual government expenditures. The interest alone on the national debt consumed 40% of the national revenue between 1790 and 1800. Hamilton was instrumental in setting up a national administration that would carry out those programs. Setting the highest possible standard, he has been called \\"one of the greatest administrators of all time.\\"Brock, 1959, p. 39 He modernized performance in public office and personally oversaw the details of an increasingly-complex system \\"without sacrificing dispatch, clarity or discipline.\\" The Treasury Department quickly grew in stature and personnel, encompassing the United States Customs Service, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, and the network of Treasury agents that Hamilton had foreseen.American Experience, hour 2American Experience Hamilton immediately followed up his success with the Second Report on Public Credit, which contained his plan for the Bank of the United States, a national privately- operated bank endowed with public funds that became the forerunner of the Federal Reserve System. In 1791 Hamilton released a third report, the Report on Manufactures, which encouraged the growth and protection of manufacturing. Hamilton's First Report on the Public Credit and his subsequent reports on a national bank and manufacturing stand as \\"the most important and influential state papers of their time and remain among the most brilliant government reports in American history.\\"Staloff, 2005, p. 91, Miller, 1960, p. 63 See also *Second Report on Public Credit *Report on Manufactures *Political economy *The Federalist Papers *Forum for Stable Currencies *Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit References  Sources  * Bordewich, Fergus M.

Although little known in her own country, she became a major figure in the history of the Australian stage, achieving the peak of her career during an Antipodean tour from 1904 to 1909. She is also notable for being the only known link between two notable acting families of different centuries, having worked in 19th- century America with Junius Brutus Booth Jr. of the Booth family, and in 20th century Australia with Roy Redgrave, founder of the Redgrave family. Although having no previous family acting background, Minnie's own two sisters Esther and Charlotte also pursued careers on the stage. Married by 1899 to Clarence Marion Brune (n√©e Browne) (1867‚Äì1935), an adventurous attorney from whom she took her stage name, the couple were immediately sued repeatedly in the state of Washington for land speculation fraud and legal scandals continued to dog her husband in Australia. Despite this they remained together until his death. With a strong religious upbringing, Minnie took her Catholic faith seriously and was often conflicted about her roles as a Catholic and an actress, describing herself in one Australian interview as \\"half a nun\\". Upon retirement or widowhood, the \\"nun\\" half came to the fore, and she was living in relative obscurity as a member of the Order of St Francis in Los Angeles, California when she died in September 1974 at the age of 99. Early life Minnie Tittell Brune was born Minnie Tittle in 1875 in San Francisco, where her mother Minna Esther St Marie kept a lodging house. She had two elder sisters: Esther, also an actress who became a \\"crack shot and expert stage swordswoman\\" and performed in at least one silent film before her death in 1934; and Charlotte, who married a theatrical manager. She also had family who were nuns. Minnie made her first stage appearance as a child of four and a half when she played Little Jim in Lights of London at the California Theatre of her home town. After her childhood appearances on stage, she was placed in a convent for about a year, perhaps in a parental attempt to discourage her from a career in theatre. Working as a child actor, she went on tour for producer Charles Frohman, appearing in New York in The Girl I left Behind and touring the United States with actors such as Junius Brutus Booth Jr. and Frederick Warde. Husband Clarence Marion Brune Minnie's husband, Clarence Marion Brune (born Clarence Marion Browne), was an attorney and a theatre producer who earned several degrees from such universities as Harvard, Wesleyan, Universit√© Laval (Quebec), University of Chicago Law School, Catholic University of America and Columbia College (New York City). Clarence was also the author of works on topics such as Modern Theatre, Greek Tragedy, Shakespearean Legal Terminology, the Romantic Movement, and English Poetry. It is recorded that she appeared with her husband Clarence (whose name she took) in a revival of Sardou's Theodora at the Grand Opera House, New York in 1901 and they toured together continuously in the United States for nearly a decade before leaving for Australia in 1904. But it was only in the Antipodes that she made a huge name for herself. Australia 1904‚Äì1909 Roy Redgrave and Miss Tittell Brune appearing in Leah Kleschna circa 1907 She was brought to Australia by J. C. Williamson, who is said to have met her while she was on her honeymoon in Europe. It was not until 1904 that he persuaded Minnie to make the voyage from California to Australia. The ship on which she and her husband travelled, The Australia, ran aground in Port Phillip Bay in June 1904. Minnie was unhurt, but she took a philosophical view of such incidents. She later told an interviewer \\"I was not alarmed about the wreck, though I fully realised the danger of it. If it was to have been that I should be drowned ‚Äì well, that‚Äôs all about it. It would have happened so. As it was ordained otherwise, here I am!\\" She made her first appearance in Sydney on Saturday, September 21, 1904, in the play Sunday, a Story of Western Life at Her Majesty's Theatre. Minnie played Sunday, \\"the whole-hearted lovable girl at a miners camp.\\" She was supported by Roy Redgrave and Gaston Mervale. The performance was a huge success and led to her becoming one of the most popular actresses on the Australian and New Zealand stage. She received lyrical reviews for her performance as \\"Peter Pan\\" in the play's first season in Australia in 1908, produced by J. C. Williamson. She was by then 29 years of age and a devout Catholic, a non-smoker and teetotaller, and often quoted the Bible in press interviews. One magazine quoted her as saying: Later career Minnie Tittell Brune‚Äôs five-year sojourn in Australia ended in 1909. She decided to try her luck in London but met with limited success. She received only mediocre reviews in her first piece, The Eternal Question at the Garrick Theatre. Her work in 1910 included Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde at the Queen's Theatre opposite H.B. Irving, Sir Henry Irving's surviving son, and as the chorus in Henry V. Minnie had few London appearances in 1911, her major role being in a play called The Woman on the Case at the Coronet theatre. The New York Times reported in August, in addition to a report that ostrich feathers were making a comeback, that she had returned on the Oceanic after an absence of nine years to appear in New York, billed as Minnie Tittell-Brune at the Manhattan Opera House in An Aztec Romance. By 1913 she was back in London where, during her stay, she made three movies under the name Fanny Tittell- Brune: Esther Redeemed (1915), Iron Justice (1916), and Temptation's Hour (1916). In 1916, Minnie was also credited as being in six other films directed by Hal Roach, starring Harold Lloyd. In 1917 she was singing at London's Coliseum, before she returned to her home country. Nothing further is known of her career. She became widowed when her husband Clarence died in 1935, and was living in obscurity as a member of the Order of St Francis when she died in her 100th year in Los Angeles in September 1974. She was interred with a Catholic service. Little noticed in her own country, and lacking even a press obituary, she was nevertheless a major figure in the history of the Australian stage where, for a period, she had been a household name in both Australia and in New Zealand.

In this regard, the song could actually regarded as critical of the normal nonsensical \\"boom-boom\\" lyrics of Eurovision entries. The phrases \\"boum-badaboum\\" and \\"boum boum\\" and a countdown are repeated throughout the lyrics. Barelli recorded the song in four languages; French, English, German, and Italian - all versions with the same title.

The battle formed part of the Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region at the time of the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15 December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force. Initial Allied goals for the landing at Arawe included securing a base for American PT boats and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. The PT boat base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, although reinforcements were en route. The main Allied landing on 15 December was successful, despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a beachhead and dug in. Japanese air units made large-scale raids against the Arawe area in the days after the landing, and in late December Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) troops unsuccessfully counterattacked the American force. In mid-January 1944 the American force, reinforced with additional infantry and tanks, launched a brief offensive that pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese units at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as part of a general retreat from western New Britain. There is no consensus among historians on whether the Allied offensive at Arawe was necessary. While some have argued that the landing served as a useful diversion ahead of the Cape Gloucester operation, others believe that the entire campaign in western New Britain was unnecessary, and that the force employed at Arawe could have been better used elsewhere. Background =Military situation= In July 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that the main objective of the Allied forces in the South Pacific and Southwest Pacific area commands was to capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul on the eastern tip of New Britain. From August 1942, U.S. and Australian forces conducted a series of offensives in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, with the goals of eliminating Japanese positions in the region and establishing air bases close to Rabaul. The Japanese forces in the area mounted a strong resistance, but were unable to stop the Allied advance.Coakley (1989), pp. 504‚Äì507 In June 1943, the Allies launched a major offensive‚Äîdesignated Operation Cartwheel‚Äîto capture Rabaul. During the next five months, Australian and U.S. forces under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur advanced along the north coast of eastern New Guinea, capturing the town of Lae and the Huon Peninsula. U.S. forces under the command of Admiral William Halsey, Jr. simultaneously advanced through the Solomon Islands from Guadalcanal, and established an air base at Bougainville in November.Coakley (1989), pp. 510‚Äì511 In June, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that it was unnecessary to capture Rabaul as the Japanese base there could be neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment. MacArthur initially opposed this change in plans, but it was endorsed by the British and United States Combined Chiefs of Staff during the Quebec Conference in August.Miller (1959), pp. 224‚Äì225 The area in which Operation Cartwheel took place The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assessed the strategic situation in the Southwest Pacific in late September 1943, and concluded that the Allies would attempt to break through the northern Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago in the coming months en route to Japan's inner perimeter in the western and central Pacific. Accordingly, reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in the area in an attempt to slow the Allied advance. Strong forces were retained at Rabaul, however, as it was believed that the Allies would attempt to capture the town. At the time, Japanese positions in western New Britain were limited to airfields at Cape Gloucester on the island's western tip and several small way stations which provided small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea with shelter from Allied aerial attacks.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 324‚Äì325 On 22 September 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) directed Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Alamo Force to secure western New Britain and the surrounding islands. This operation had two goals, the first of which was to establish air and PT boat bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective was to secure the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits between New Guinea and New Britain so that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that both Cape Gloucester and Gasmata on New Britain's south coast be captured. This offensive was code-named Operation Dexterity.Miller (1959), pp. 272‚Äì273 The 1st Marine Division was selected for the Cape Gloucester operation, and the heavily reinforced 126th Regimental Combat Team from the 32nd Infantry Division was to attack Gasmata. Senior Allied commanders disagreed over whether it was necessary to land forces in western New Britain. Lieutenant General George Kenney‚Äîcommander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific‚Äîopposed the landings, arguing that his forces did not need air fields at Cape Gloucester as the existing bases in New Guinea and surrounding islands were adequate to support the planned landings in the region. Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender‚Äîcommander of both the 7th Fleet and the Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area‚Äîas well as Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey‚Äîcommander of Task Force 76 (TF 76)‚Äîsupported occupying Cape Gloucester to secure both sides of the straits, but opposed the landing at Gasmata as it was too close to the Japanese air bases at Rabaul. The Gasmata operation was cancelled in early November in response to the concerns raised by Kenney and the Navy as well as intelligence reports that the Japanese had reinforced their garrison there.Miller (1959), pp. 273‚Äì274 On 21 November, a conference between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey was held in Brisbane at which it was decided to land a small force in the Arawe area.Miller (1959), p. 274 This operation had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact with the Marines once they landed.Holzimmer (2007), p. 117 It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.Morison (2001), p. 372 =Geography= The Arawe area The Arawe area lies on the south coast of New Britain about from the island's western tip. Its main geographical feature is Cape Merkus, which ends in the \\"L\\"-shaped Arawe Peninsula. Several small islands called the Arawe Islands lie to the southwest of the Cape.Rottman (2002), p. 186 In late 1943, the Arawe Peninsula was covered by coconut trees which formed part of the Amalut Plantation; the terrain inland from the peninsula and on its offshore islands was swampy. Most of the shoreline in the area has limestone cliffs. There was a small unused airfield east of the neck of the Arawe Peninsula, and a coastal trail leading east from Cape Merkus to the Pulie River where it split into tracks running inland and along the coast. The terrain to the west of the peninsula was a trackless region of swamp and jungle, which was very difficult for troops to move through.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 334 Several of the beaches in the Arawe area were suitable for landing craft; the best were House Fireman, on the peninsula's west coast, and one near the village of Umtingalu to the east of the peninsula's base.Miller (1959), p. 283 Prelude =Planning= Alamo Force was responsible for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15 December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals.Miller (1959), pp. 274‚Äì275 As Arawe was believed to be only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary.Miller (1959), p. 279 The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 335 The commander of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed that he would not be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe. The Director Task Force's commander‚ÄîBrigadier General Julian W. Cunningham‚Äîissued orders for the landing on 4 December. He directed that the Task Force would initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an outpost on the trail leading to the Pulie River. The main body of the Director Task Force was to land at House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula at about dawn. Two troop-sized forces would conduct separate operations about an hour before the main landing. One troop was to capture Pitoe Island to the peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbor. The other troop was to land at Umtingalu and establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted to the west of the peninsula in an attempt to make contact with the Marines at Cape Gloucester.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 334‚Äì335 U.S. Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing conducted at Lae in September had proven difficult.Barbey (1969), p. 101 =Opposing forces= The Director Task Force was centered around the U.S. Army's 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team (112th RCT). This regiment had arrived in the Pacific in August 1942 but had not seen combat. It was dismounted and converted to an infantry unit in May 1943, and undertook an unopposed landing at Woodlark Island (designated Operation Chronicle) on 23 June.Rottman (2009), pp. 21‚Äì22 The 112th Cavalry Regiment was smaller and more lightly armed than U.S. infantry regiments as it had only two battalion-sized squadrons compared to the three battalions in infantry regiments. Moreover, the squadrons were smaller and more lightly equipped than their infantry equivalents.Rottman (2009), p. 13 The 112th RCT's combat support units were the M2A1 howitzer-equipped 148th Field Artillery Battalion and the 59th Engineer Company. The other combat units of the Director Task Force were two batteries of the 470th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Automatic Weapons), most of the 236th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion (Searchlight), \\"A\\" Company of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion and a detachment from the 26th Quartermaster War Dog Platoon.Rottman (2009), p. 24 The 2nd Battalion of the 158th Infantry Regiment was held in reserve to reinforce the Director Task Force if required. Several engineer, medical, ordnance and other support units were scheduled to arrive at Arawe after the landing was completed.Miller (1959), p. 277 Cunningham requested a battery equipped with anti-aircraft guns, but none were available.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 336 The U.S. Navy's Beach Party Number 1 would also be landed with the Director Task Force and remain at Arawe until the beachhead was secured.Barbey (1969), pp. 103‚Äì104 Movements of Japanese forces in western New Britain during late 1943 and early 1944 and locations of Allied landings The Director Task Force was supported by Allied naval and air units. The naval force was drawn from TF 76 and comprised U.S. Navy destroyers (Barbey's flagship), , , , , , , and and a transport group with destroyer transports and , the Australian landing ship infantry , landing ship dock , two patrol craft and two submarine chasers. The naval force also included a service group with three LSTs, three tugboats and the destroyer tender .Gill (1968), p. 338Morison (2001), p. 374 United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) units operating under the Fifth Air Force would support the landing, but only limited air support was to be available after 15 December as the available aircraft were needed for strategic missions against Japanese bases.Morison (2001), p. 373 Australian coastwatchers stationed on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 to provide warning of air attacks from Rabaul bound for the Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.Gill (1968), pp. 335‚Äì336Feldt (1991), pp. 341‚Äì349 At the time of the Allied landing, the Arawe area was defended by only a small force, though reinforcements were en route. The Japanese force at Arawe comprised 120 soldiers and sailors organized in two temporary companies drawn from the 51st Division.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 339‚Äì340 The reinforcing units were elements of the 17th Division, which had been shipped from China to Rabaul during October 1943 to reinforce western New Britain ahead of the expected Allied invasion. The convoys carrying the division were attacked by U.S. Navy submarines and USAAF bombers and suffered 1,173 casualties. The 1st Battalion, 81st Infantry Regiment was assigned to defend Cape Merkus. However, it did not depart Rabaul until December as it needed to be reorganized after suffering casualties when the ship transporting it from China was sunk. In addition, two of its rifle companies, most of its heavy machine guns and all its howitzers were retained by the 8th Area Army at Rabaul, leaving the battalion with just its headquarters, two rifle companies and a machine gun platoon. This battalion‚Äîwhich came under the command of Major Masamitsu Komori‚Äîwas a four-day march from Arawe when the Allies landed.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 327‚Äì328 A company of soldiers from the 54th Infantry Regiment, some engineers and detachments from other units were also assigned to the Arawe area. The ground forces at Arawe came under the overall command of General Matsuda, whose headquarters were located near Cape Gloucester.Miller (1959), p. 280 The Japanese air units at Rabaul had been greatly weakened in the months prior to the landing at Arawe by prolonged Allied attacks and the transfer of the 7th Air Division to western New Guinea.Miller (1959), pp. 281‚Äì282 Nevertheless, the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN) 11th Air Fleet had 100 fighters and 50 bombers based at Rabaul at the time of the landing at Arawe.Miller (1959), p. 287 =Preliminary operations= The Allies possessed little intelligence on western New Britain's terrain and the exact location of Japanese forces, so they flew extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats.Miller (1959), pp. 276‚Äì277 A team from Special Service Unit No. 1 reconnoitered Arawe on the night of 9/10 December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area.Rottman (2005a), p. 37 The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.Morison (2001), pp. 374‚Äì375 Operation Dexterity was preceded by a major Allied air offensive which sought to neutralize the Japanese air units stationed at Rabaul. From 12 October until early November, the Fifth Air Force frequently attacked the airfields around the town as well as ships in its harbor. Aircraft flying from U.S. Navy aircraft carriers also attacked Rabaul on 5 and 11 November in support of the USMC's landing at Bougainville.Mortensen (1950), pp. 318‚Äì328 The Allied air forces began pre-invasion raids on western New Britain on 13 November. Few attacks were made on the Arawe area, however, as the Allies hoped to achieve tactical surprise for the landing and did not want to alert the Japanese to their intentions. Instead, heavy attacks were made against Gasmata, Ring Ring Plantation and Lindenhafen Plantation on New Britain's south coast. The Arawe area was struck for the first time on 6 December and again on 8 December; little opposition was encountered on either occasion. It was not until 14 December‚Äîthe day before the landing‚Äîthat heavy air attacks on Arawe were conducted; Allied aircraft flew 273 sorties against targets on New Britain's south coast that day.Mortensen (1950), pp. 332‚Äì335 In addition to these air raids, a force comprising two Australian and two American destroyers (designated Task Force 74.2) bombarded the Gasmata area during the night of 29/30 November.Gill (1968), pp. 336‚Äì337 The Director Task Force was concentrated at Goodenough Island in early December 1943. The 112th Cavalry was notified that it had been selected for the Arawe operation on 24 November, and departed Woodlark for the short voyage to Goodenough Island in two convoys that sailed on 30 and 31 November. All elements of the regiment were ashore at Goodenough by 2 December.Powell (2006), p. 66 A full-scale rehearsal of the landing was held at the island on 8 December; this revealed problems with coordinating the waves of boats and demonstrated that some of the force's officers were insufficiently trained in amphibious warfare. There was insufficient time for further training to rectify these problems, however.Powell (2006), p. 67 At Goodenough, the troopers of the 112th Cavalry were issued with several types of infantry weapons with which they had not previously been equipped. Each of the regiment's rifle squads received a Browning Automatic rifle and a Thompson submachine gun, and a number of bazookas, rifle grenades and flame throwers were also issued. The cavalrymen received little training on the use of these weapons however, and did not know how to make the best use of them in combat.Powell (2006), pp. 66‚Äì67 The invasion force boarded transport ships during the afternoon of 13 December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to Buna in New Guinea to rendezvous with most of the escorting destroyers and made a feint north toward Finschhafen before turning toward Arawe after dusk on 14 December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30 am on 15 December, and the 11th Air Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it. Battle Arawe landings, 15 December 1943 =Landings= Shortly after the assault convoy arrived off Arawe, Carter Hall launched LVT amphibious tractors and Westralia lowered landing craft, both operated by specialized Marine and U.S. Army units. The two large transports departed for New Guinea at 5:00 am. The high speed transports carrying \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Troops of the 112th Cavalry Regiment's 1st Squadron closed to within of Umtingalu and Pilelo Island respectively, and unloaded the soldiers into rubber boats.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 338 \\"A\\" Troop's attempt to land at Umtingalu ended in failure. At about 5:25 am, the troop came under fire from machine guns, rifles and a cannon as it was nearing the shore, and all but three of its 15 rubber boats were sunk.Miller (1959), p. 284 Shaw‚Äîthe destroyer assigned to support the landing‚Äîwas unable to fire upon the Japanese positions until 5:42 am as her crew initially could not determine if the soldiers in the water were in the ship's line of fire. Once she had a clear shot, Shaw silenced the Japanese force with two salvos from her guns.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 338‚Äì339 The surviving cavalrymen were rescued by small boats and later landed at House Fireman beach; casualties in this operation were 12 killed, four missing and 17 wounded.Miller (1959), p. 285 The landing conducted by \\"B\\" Troop at Pilelo Island was successful. The goal of this operation was to destroy a Japanese radio station believed to be at the village of Paligmete on the island's east coast. The troop was originally intended to come ashore near Paligmete, but the landing site was switched to the island's west coast after \\"A\\" Troop came under attack. After disembarking from their boats, the cavalrymen advanced east and came under fire from a small Japanese force stationed in two caves near the village of Winguru on the island's north coast. Ten cavalrymen were detached to contain the Japanese while the remainder of the troop continued to Paligmete. The village proved to be unoccupied, and did not contain the suspected radio station. The majority of \\"B\\" Troop then attacked Winguru, using bazookas and flamethrowers to destroy the Japanese positions.Powell (2006), p. 71 One American and seven Japanese soldiers were killed in the fighting. Personnel from the RAAF's No. 335 Radar Station also landed on Pilelo Island on 15 December, and established a radar station there in 48 hours.Odgers (1957), p. 127 The 2nd Squadron, 112th Cavalry Regiment made the main landing at House Fireman Beach. The landing was delayed by a strong current and difficulties forming the LVTs into an assault formation, and the first wave went ashore at 7:28 am rather than 6:30 am as planned. Destroyers bombarded the beach with 1,800 rounds of 5 inch ammunition between 6:10 and 6:25 am, and B-25 Mitchells strafed the area once the bombardment concluded, but the landing area was not under fire as the troops approached the beach. This allowed Japanese machine gunners to fire on the LVTs, but these guns were rapidly silenced by rockets fired from and two DUKWs. The first wave of cavalrymen were fortunate to meet little opposition as there were further delays in landing the follow-up waves owing to differences in the speeds of the two types of LVTs used. While the four follow-up waves were scheduled to land at five-minute intervals after the first wave, the second landed 25 minutes after the initial force and the succeeding three waves landed simultaneously 15 minutes later.Miller (1959), pp. 285‚Äì286Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 339 Within two hours of the landing, all the large Allied ships other than Barbey's flagship had departed from Arawe. Conyngham remained in the area to rescue the survivors of the landing at Umtingalu, and withdrew later that day.Barbey (1969), pp. 106‚Äì107 Once ashore, the cavalrymen rapidly secured the Arawe Peninsula. An American patrol sent to the peninsula's toe met only scattered resistance from Japanese rear guards. More than 20 Japanese located in a cave on the east side of the peninsula were killed by members of \\"E\\" Troop and personnel from the squadron headquarters; the remaining Japanese units in the area retreated to the east.Miller (1959), pp. 286‚Äì287 The 2nd Squadron reached the peninsula's base at 2:30 pm, where it began to prepare its main line of resistance (MLR).Powell (2006), p. 73 By the end of 15 December, more than 1,600 Allied troops were ashore. The two Japanese Army companies that had been stationed at Arawe withdrew to the northeast, and took up positions at Didmop on the Pulie River about from the MLR; the naval unit defending Umtingalu retreated inland in a state of disarray. The Allied naval force off Arawe was subjected to a heavy air raid shortly after the landing. At 9:00 am, eight Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers escorted by 56 A6M5 \\"Zero\\" fighters evaded the USAAF combat air patrol (CAP) of 16 P-38 Lightnings. The Japanese force attacked the recently arrived first supply echelon, which comprised five Landing Craft Tank (LCT) and 14 Landing Craft Medium (LCM), but these ships managed to evade the bombs dropped on them.Morison (2001), p. 376 The first wave of attackers suffered no losses, but at 11:15 am four P-38s shot down a Zero, and at 6:00 pm a force of 30 Zeros and 12 Mitsubishi G4M3 \\"Betty\\" and Mitsubishi Ki-21-II \\"Sally\\" bombers was driven off by four P-38s.Mortensen (1950), p. 336 The Japanese lost two Zeros in the day's air actions, but both pilots survived.Hata (2011), p. 65 =Air attacks and base development= Although the U.S. ground troops faced no opposition in the days immediately after the landing, naval convoys carrying reinforcements to the Arawe area were repeatedly attacked. The second supply echelon came under continuous air attack on 16 December, resulting in the loss of as well as damage to , and four LCTs. About 42 men on board these ships were killed or seriously wounded. Another reinforcement convoy was attacked three times by dive bombers on 21 December as it unloaded at Arawe.Morison (2001), p. 377Hata (2011), p. 66 Overall, at least 150 Japanese aircraft attacked Arawe that day. Further air attacks took place on 26, 27 and 31 December. However, the Allied air forces were able to mount a successful defense of the Arawe area as the coastwatcher parties in New Britain provided 30 to 60 minutes warning of most incoming raids.Drea (1992), p. 91 Between 15 and 31 December, at least 24 Japanese bombers and 32 fighters were shot down near Arawe. During the same time period, Allied air units also raided airfields at Rabaul and Madang in New Guinea which were believed to be the bases of the aircraft which had attacked Arawe. In aerial combat over Rabaul on 17, 19, and 23 December, 14 Zeros were shot down by Allied aircraft.Mortensen (1950), pp. 337‚Äì338 The process of unloading ships at Arawe was hampered by air attacks and congestion on House Fireman Beach. The beach party contributed to these delays as it was inexperienced and too small. The resultant problems with unloading LCTs caused some to leave the area before discharging all their cargo.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 340‚Äì342 Two U.S. Army trucks moving through a camp area at Arawe Air attacks on Arawe dropped off after 1 January. As a result of the heavy losses they suffered during attacks on Arawe and Cape Gloucester, and the damage caused by Allied raids on Rabaul, Japanese air units conducted only small-scale raids at night after this date. The IJN fighter units based at Rabaul and nearby Kavieng were also kept busy throughout January and February 1944 defending their bases from continuous Allied air attacks.Mortensen (1950), p. 341Hata (2011), pp. 66‚Äì69 Few raids were made against the Arawe area after 90 mm anti-aircraft guns were established there on 1 February. These weak attacks did not disrupt the Allied convoys. In the three weeks after the landing, of supplies as well as 541 artillery guns and vehicles were transported to Arawe. On 20 February, the Japanese air units at Rabaul and Kavieng were permanently withdrawn to Truk, ending any significant aerial threat to Allied forces in New Britain from the IJN.Hata (2011), p. 69 Following the landing, the 59th Engineer Company constructed logistics facilities in the Arawe area. Due to the Japanese air raids, priority was given to the construction of a partially underground evacuation hospital, which was completed in January 1944. The underground hospital was replaced with a 120-bed above-ground facility in April 1944. Pilelo Island was selected for the site of the PT boat facilities, and a pier for refueling the boats and dispersed fuel storage bays were built there. A pier was constructed at House Fireman Beach between 26 February and 22 April 1944 to accommodate small ships; three LCT jetties were also built north of the beach. A by airstrip was hurriedly built for artillery observation aircraft on 13 January, and this was later upgraded and surfaced with coral. The engineer company also constructed of all-weather roads in the Arawe region and provided the Director Task Force with water via salt water distillation units on Pilelo Island and wells dug on the mainland. These projects were continuously hampered by shortages of construction materials, but the engineers were able to complete them by improvising and making use of salvaged material.Office of the Chief Engineer, General Headquarters, Army Forces, Pacific (1951), p. 192 The 112th Cavalry RCT strengthened its defensive positions during the week following the invasion. As \\"A\\" Troop had lost all of its weapons and other equipment during the landing attempt at Umtingalu, supplies were air-dropped into the beachhead during the afternoon of 16 December to re-equip the unit.Mortensen (1950), p. 335 The troop was also assigned 50 replacement personnel. Most of \\"B\\" Troop was also transferred from Pilelo Island to the mainland in the days after the landing.Powell (2006), p. 75 The regiment improved its MLR by removing vegetation in order to create clear fields of fire, establishing minefields and wire entanglements and laying down a field telephone network. A reserve defensive line was also established closer to Cape Merkus, and patrols were conducted each day along the shores of the peninsula in search of Japanese personnel attempting to infiltrate the Task Force's rear area. These patrols located and killed between ten and twenty Japanese near Cape Merkus. In addition, the regiment established a network of observation posts throughout the Arawe area; these included positions in villages, key positions on the peninsula and on several offshore islands. \\"G\\" Troop was assigned to secure Umtingalu, and after doing so the troop established a patrol base at the village as well as two observation posts along the track which connected it to the MLR. =Japanese response= The commander of the Japanese 17th Division‚ÄîLieutenant General Yasushi Sakai‚Äîordered that Arawe be urgently reinforced when he was informed of the landing there. He did not believe that this would be the main Allied effort in western New Britain, however.Willoughby (1966), pp. 237‚Äì238 The force under Komori was ordered to make haste. The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, stationed at Cape Bushing on the south coast of New Britain about east of Arawe was also directed to move by sea to counter the Allied invasion. One of this battalion's infantry companies remained at Cape Bushing, however. Komori was appointed the commander of all Japanese forces in the Arawe area, which were subsequently designated the Komori Force. The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment landed at the village of Omoi on the night of 18 December, and started overland the next day to link up with Komori at Didmop. The battalion took eight days to cover the between Omoi and Didmop as it became lost on several occasions while travelling through trackless jungle and paused whenever contact with American forces seemed likely. Komori reached Didmop on 19 December, and gathered the units that had retreated from Umtingalu into his command. On the basis of discussions with personnel who had witnessed the landing at Arawe, Komori mistakenly concluded that they had greatly overestimated the size of the Allied force. As a result, on 20 December he decided to launch a counteroffensive against the American positions.Powell (2006), p. 77 American soldiers returning to positions at Arawe after completing a patrol in December 1943 After establishing its beachhead, the Director Task Force conducted a series of reconnaissance patrols. Cunningham had been ordered to gather intelligence on Japanese forces in western New Britain, and on 17 December he dispatched a patrol of cavalrymen in two LCVPs (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) to the west of Arawe to investigate the Itni River area. These landing craft encountered seven Japanese barges carrying part of the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment near Cape Peiho, west of Arawe, on 18 December. After an exchange of gunfire the U.S. soldiers abandoned their landing craft and returned to Arawe along the coast.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 342Miller (1959), p. 288 Another patrol travelling in LCVPs was fired on by Japanese barges near Umtingalu on 18 December but was able to return to Cape Merkus. Japanese barges were also sighted near Arawe on 23 December. Cunningham believed that a large Japanese force was heading for the beachhead, and contacted Krueger on 24 December to request that the 2nd Battalion of the 158th Infantry Regiment be dispatched to reinforce his command. Krueger agreed to this request, and ordered that three of the battalion's four infantry companies be sent to Arawe. \\"G\\" Company of the 2nd Battalion, 158th Infantry arrived on 27 December and the other two companies reached Arawe in early January.Powell (2006), p. 83 After organizing his force while waiting for the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, Komori began his advance on Arawe on 24 December. He arrived at the airstrip to the north of Arawe during the early hours of Christmas Day.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 343 During that morning, elements of the Komori Force ambushed two platoon- sized American patrols traveling in trucks northeast of Umtingalu. The American units withdrew to the village and reinforced \\"G\\" Troop's defensive position there. The American force defeated several Japanese attempts to move around Umtingalu during the day, and killed at least three enemy soldiers. Cunningham believed that the force encountered around Umtingalu was the advance guard of a much larger body of Japanese soldiers advancing from Gasmata, and withdrew the troopers stationed around the village to positions behind the MLR.Powell (2006), p. 78 At 10:30 pm that night, 50 Japanese soldiers made a poorly coordinated attack on the MLR. While they succeeded in overrunning some American positions, the Japanese were repulsed by fire from the 112th Cavalry's mortars. The Americans lost one man killed and eight wounded, and estimated that the Japanese had suffered twelve casualties. The Japanese offensive continued after the Christmas Day attack. Two small attacks, each involving 15 soldiers, were made against the eastern edge of the MLR on the nights of 26 and 27 December. These were also repulsed by the 112th Cavalry's light mortars, and inflicted only a small number of casualties on the American force.Powell (2006), pp. 78‚Äì79 On 28 December part of the 112th Cavalry Regiment's \\"B\\" Troop set out from the MLR in an attempt to reach Umtingalu, but withdrew after encountering snipers and some light mortar fire. A platoon from \\"C\\" Troop also made an unsuccessful patrol from the western end of the MLR during which it suffered six casualties from Japanese machine gun and rifle fire.Powell (2006), p. 79 The same day, Komori dispatched a force of between 20 and 30 soldiers to destroy the American mortar positions. The Japanese soldiers infiltrated the American positions by wading through swamps at the western end of the MLR, but were detected before they could reach dry land. The Director Task Force mounted a strong response, which included a counterattack by elements of three cavalry troops and a platoon from the 158th Infantry Regiment supported by mortars. The Japanese force suffered 17 casualties. The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment arrived in the Arawe area on the afternoon of 29 December, and conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks in early January 1944 before taking up positions about north of the American MLR. These positions comprised shallow trenches and foxholes which were difficult to see. While there were only about 100 Japanese soldiers in the area, they moved their six machine guns frequently, making them difficult targets for American mortars and artillery. =American counter-attack= An American patrol located the Japanese defensive position on 1 January 1944. \\"B\\" Troop of the 112th Cavalry Regiment launched an attack later that morning, but was beaten off by heavy fire; the Americans suffered three killed and 15 wounded in this action. On 4 January, \\"G\\" Troop incurred three killed and 21 wounded in an unsuccessful attack on well-built Japanese positions. This operation had been conducted without artillery support in an attempt to surprise the Japanese, and also included a feint against Umtingalu involving several LCMs. Further attacks on 6, 7 and 11 January failed to make any headway, but gave the cavalrymen experience in maneuvering through the Japanese defensive positions.Powell (2006), pp. 79‚Äì81 These American operations were conducted on a limited scale as Cunningham and the 112th Cavalry Regiment's other senior officers believed that the unit had already achieved the goals of the landing at Arawe and did not want to incur unnecessary casualties.Powell (2006), pp. 81‚Äì82 USMC tanks supporting the Army advance on 16 January On 6 January, Cunningham requested further reinforcements, including tanks, to tackle the Japanese defenses. Krueger approved this request and ordered \\"F\\" Company, 158th Infantry Regiment and \\"B\\" Company of the USMC 1st Tank Battalion to Arawe; the two units arrived on 10 and 12 January respectively. The Marine tanks and two companies of the 158th Infantry Regiment subsequently practiced tank-infantry cooperation from 13 to 15 January; during this period the 112th Cavalry continued to conduct patrols into Japanese-held areas.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 392Miller (1959), p. 289 By this time, the Komori Force had incurred casualties of at least 65 killed, 75 wounded and 14 missing in action as a result of its offensive actions as well as the attacks on it conducted by the Director Task Force. The Japanese were also suffering from severe supply shortages and an outbreak of dysentery.Powell (2006), p. 82 The Director Task Force launched its attack on 16 January. That morning, a squadron of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers dropped one hundred and thirty-six bombs on the Japanese defenses, and 20 B-25s strafed the area. Following an intensive artillery and mortar barrage the Marine tank company, two companies of the 158th Infantry and C Troop, 112th Cavalry Regiment attacked. The tanks led the advance, with each being followed by a group of infantrymen. The cavalry troop and three tanks were initially held in reserve, but were sent into action at 12:00 pm to mop up a Japanese position. The attack was successful, and reached its objectives by 4:00 pm. Cunningham then directed the force to withdraw to the MLR; during this part of the operation two Marine tanks‚Äîwhich had become immobile‚Äîwere destroyed to prevent the Japanese from using them as pillboxes.Powell (2006), p. 84Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 392‚Äì393 American engineers destroyed the Japanese defensive position the next day. The Director Task Force suffered 22 killed and 64 wounded in this operation and estimated that 139 Japanese had been killed. Following the American attack, Komori pulled his remaining force back to defend the airstrip. As this was not an Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S. Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8 February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 393 They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 394 Aftermath The 1st Marine Division's landing at Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943 was successful. The Marines secured the airfields that were the main objective of the operation on 29 December against only light Japanese opposition. Heavy fighting took place during the first two weeks of 1944 when the Marines advanced south to the east of their initial beachhead to secure Borgen Bay. Little fighting took place once this area had been captured and the Marines patrolled extensively in an attempt to locate the Japanese.Miller (1959), pp. 289‚Äì294 On 16 February, a Marine patrol from Cape Gloucester made contact with an Army patrol from Arawe at the village of Gilnit.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 403 On 23 February, the remnants of the Japanese force at Cape Gloucester were ordered to withdraw to Rabaul.Miller (1959), p. 294 Japanese evacuation routes from western New Britain The Komori Force was also directed to withdraw on 24 February as part of the general Japanese retreat from western New Britain. The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27 February, when an attack conducted by the 2nd Squadron, 112th Cavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition. The Director Task Force subsequently established a number of observation posts along the southern coast of New Britain and increased the distances covered by its reconnaissance patrols.Powell (2006), pp. 84‚Äì85 Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9 April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling with were ambushed by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, which had landed around Volupai and captured Talasea, on the Willaumez Peninsula, in early March.Shaw and Kane (1963), pp. 413‚Äì427 The Japanese force at Arawe suffered much heavier casualties than the Allies. The Director Task Force's total casualties between 15 December 1943 and the end of major fighting in the area were 118 dead, 352 wounded, and four missing. Most of these casualties were members of the 112th Cavalry Regiment, which suffered 72 killed, 142 wounded and four missing. Japanese casualties over this period were 304 men killed and three captured.Powell (2006), p. 85 In the period immediately after the Japanese withdrawal, the Director Task Force remained at Arawe. In line with standard practice, the 112th Cavalry continued to improve the defensive positions in the area. The regiment also undertook training, and some men were granted leave in Australia and the United States. Combat patrols continued to be conducted in the Arawe region in search of Japanese stragglers.Powell (2006), p. 106 Elements of the 40th Infantry Division began to arrive at Arawe in April 1944 to assume responsibility for garrisoning the area. The 112th Cavalry Regiment was informed that it was to be deployed in New Guinea in early June, and the Director Task Force was dissolved at this time. The regiment sailed for the Aitape area of New Guinea on 8 June and next saw combat there during the Battle of Driniumor River.Powell (2006), p. 107 The 40th Infantry Division maintained a garrison at Arawe until the Australian Army's 5th Division assumed responsibility for New Britain in late November 1944.Long (1963), p. 241 Historians disagree over whether the Arawe operation was worthwhile for the Allies. The official history of the USMC in World War II stated that the presence of two experienced Japanese battalions at Arawe made the 1st Marine Division's task at Cape Gloucester easier. However, Samuel Eliot Morison wrote in his History of United States Naval Operations in World War II that \\"Arawe was of small value\\" as the Allies never used it as a naval base and the garrison stationed in the area after the landings would have been better employed elsewhere. The U.S. Army's official history concluded that in retrospect the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester \\"were probably not essential to the reduction of Rabaul or the approach to the Philippines\\", though the offensive in western New Britain had some benefits and was not \\"excessively high in casualties\\".Miller (1959), pp. 294‚Äì295 References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography=        * External links * Category:1943 in Papua New Guinea Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Arawe Arawe Arawe Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:Territory of New Guinea Category:New Britain Arawe Category:United States Marine Corps in World War II Category:Amphibious operations of World War II Category:December 1943 events Category:January 1944 events Category:February 1944 events Category:Amphibious operations involving the United States ","title":"Battle of Arawe"},{"id":"8008899","text":"Leopoldo Miguez.

Urizen Books published Harry Mathews' English-language translation in 1978. The book deals with necrophilia. Plot summary Henri Troppmann goes from his sick-bed in Paris to Barcelona before the Spanish Civil War in time to witness a Catalan General Strike. He is torn between three different women, all of whom arrive in the city at that time. One of them, Lazare, is a Marxist Jew and political activist, who is preparing herself for prospective torture and martyrdom at the hand of General Francisco Franco's troops if she is captured. \\"Dirty\\" (or Dorothea) is an incontinent, unkempt alcoholic who repeatedly has sex with Troppmann. X√©nie is a young woman who had previously nursed him to health during his violent fever in Paris. The novel is introduced by a scene of extreme degeneracy in a London hotel room, followed by the narrator's description of a dreamlike encounter with 'the Commendatore' (English: \\"the Commander\\"), who in the Don Juan myth is the father of one of Don Juan's victims, and whose statue returns at the end of the story to drag Don Juan down to hell for his sins. Troppmann has to choose between the abject Dirty and her associations of sex, disease, excrement and decay, the politically engaged Lazare, and her ethical values of commitment, resistance and endurance, and X√©nie, who has outlived her usefulness. While looking at Lazare beneath a tree, Troppmann realises that he respects her for her social conscience, but also sees her as a rat, and chooses Dirty instead, whilst sending X√©nie off with a friend, who is subsequently killed in the street. He travels with Dirty to Trier, the home-town of Karl Marx, where the two copulate in the mud on a cliff overlooking a candle-lit graveyard. They see a Hitler Youth group, lending Dirty a vision of the war to come and their probable deaths. Troppmann leaves her to return to Paris.

It broadly depicts the wars in, and migrations to, the island of Great Britain in the centuries from the Roman invasions to the Norman Conquest. Britannia was selected among the anthology Hobby Games: The 100 Best and is ranked by members of the Board Game Geek site in the top 350 of over 10,000 ranked games.Britannia  BoardGameGeek Britannia has spawned a subgenre of wargames characterized by epic time scales with players taking the part of multiple tribes or nations over the course of the game.GeekList: Britannia and offspring  BoardGameGeek Components * a rulebook * a board depicting a map of the island of Britain * 251 unit markers in red, blue, yellow and green representing infantry, cavalry, leaders, Roman forts and Saxon Burhs. * 17 nation cards with information about each nation * 175 victory point tokens in denominations of 1, 5 and 25 * 16 population markers * one sword-shaped game round marker * five white, six-sided combat dice Gameplay The game laid out Britannia is a 3-5 player game that takes about four hours to complete. Primary rules are for four players using the counter colours, but there are variant scenarios for three and five players, as well as a 3-player shorter Game and several short 2-player scenarios. Each player controls several nations. The game begins with one army in each area of Britain, with each part of the island occupied by different nations: the Belgae, Welsh, Brigantes, Caledonians (representing the distinctive Broch culture) and Picts. A force of Romans begin in the English Channel and are the first nation to move. Through their superior fighting power and mobility the Romans will come to dominate most of the board, but eventually the Roman Empire will withdraw their forces from Britain completely, leaving behind just the scattered Romano-British. Meanwhile, throughout the game, further nations arrive from across the seas: the Irish and Scots, and later the Dubliners, from the west; the Norsemen from the north; the Saxons, Angles, Danes and Norwegians from the east; the Jutes and Normans from the south. All of these nations will compete with each other, as well as the existing nations, for turf. Some nations will be destroyed, and the recurring theme in Britannia is that nations will rise and fall. However all nations will make their contribution to a player‚Äôs Victory Point total and eventual victory or defeat. At the end of the game all four players will have the possibility to become the King of England through their control of Harold the Saxon, William of Normandy, Harald Hardrada and Svein Estrithson. It is possible that no nation will be king if all four of these leaders have been killed or if they lack the required number of regions. However this in itself will not determine who will win the game. Nations take their turns in strict order, each taking one turn in each Game Round. Each nation's turn has five phases. ; Population Increase Phase : In this phase nations other than the Romans count the territory they hold and may be able to add new armies to the board through natural increase of population. ; Movement Phase : In this phase a nation may move none, some or all of its pieces on the board. Distances are generally limited, but some nations may be able to move pieces along the coasts using boats. Also new forces arriving from across the sea will be able to land. Roman and cavalry forces can move further than infantry, as can forces with leaders. ; Battles/Retreats Phase : Where a nation has moved forces into an area held by another nation a battle will occur. Once all movement is complete battles are resolved with the aid of dice. Battles are conducted in rounds and forces of both sides may retreat after each round. The ability of nations to retreat and fight another day is a major part of the flavour of gameplay. ; Raider Withdrawal Phase : Some nations have designated Game Rounds called Raiding Turns which allow their forces to remain at sea, or return to the sea after making an attack on the land. These forces will return in later Game Rounds. ; Overpopulation Phase : At the end of their turn if a nation other than the Romans has more armies than twice the number of areas held, the excess armies are removed due to overpopulation. A nation is made up of several different playing pieces: ; Army : These represent the fighting forces of the nation, as well as possessing some characteristics of population. ; Leader : These have no combat strength in themselves, but increase the combat strength of all forces they are with. Named leaders appear on various Game Rounds for specific nations throughout the game. ; Fort : These represent Roman Forts. The Romans build a fort in each area they conquer. These fight as normal armies and may not move. The Romans must protect their forts, as they can only score on Round V for areas that contain an undestroyed fort. If a fort is destroyed it is turned over onto its destroyed side, to show that the Romans failed to protect that area. Forts may not be rebuilt. ; Burh : These represent Saxons fortified settlements or Burhs. These may be built if the Saxons hold less than a set limit of areas on certain Rounds, and help the Saxons build up their strength for resisting the expansion of the Danelaw late in the game. The player whose nations have achieved the highest Victory Point total at the end of the game is the winner. Nations can score Victory Points on any Game Round, such as for eliminating certain opposing pieces or temporarily capturing certain areas, but will mostly score for holding different areas of Britain during the Scoring Rounds of Round V, VII, X, XIII and XVI. Also nations can score additional points by achieving Bretwalda or King of England. Nations all have their own Victory Point objectives listed on their Nation cards, and each player colour will accumulate Victory Points at different rates through the game. This means that at any given moment who is actually winning will not be immediately obvious. Experienced players develop an idea of what typical scores are at different stages of a game and so will be able to tell what is really going on. An ideal game ends with a close finish with several players still being able to win, and the outcome resting on one battle or roll of the dice. Development history This game was created by Lewis Pulsipher in 1983 under the working title of Invasions. It was first published by Gibsons Games as Britannia from 1986 in the United Kingdom in two slightly different versions after development by Roger Heyworth. A German-language version was released by Welt der Spiele and the game was later republished in the United States by Avalon Hill. The game developed a devoted following across the world, and when in 2003, after a long break from board game work and having regained the publishing rights, Lewis Pulsipher announced he would be extensively revising the game, a great deal of player input contributed to the revision, which not only tidied up the rules, but also brought in a number of new features. Consequently, the newest version published by Fantasy Flight Games is sometimes known as Britannia Second Edition, or Britannia II. This version was first published in 2005, and when the first print run sold out a reprint was produced in 2008, incorporating all official errata and corrections, as well as new language versions in German, French, Spanish and Hungarian. The Fantasy Flight version went out of print in mid-2012. A new edition, including two new, shorter games (one diceless) using new boards is being prepared by the designer. There are plans by Lewis Pulsipher to have an improved new version, which includes an option of having 'Epic Britannia' (this extension includes the Isle of Man and six areas in Ireland). Other possible options include extra Welsh leaders and Danish Burhs. One of the most popular additions was the 'Oh Danny Boy' \\"The GENERAL Vol. 30, No. 2\\" printed and distributed July 1993. By Jim Lawler, which included a variant for the First Edition rules. The rules included Isle of Man (part of England) and 4 Irish areas, an extra leader 'Brian Boru' was also an option. Changes between versions At each stage of development and publication of Britannia changes were made to the rules of the game, as well as to the scenario and materials: ; Map : On the hand-drawn map in the original Invasions prototype there was just one Mercia area, and several areas had different names, such as Somerset, which would later be Avalon, and Berkshire, which would later become Downlands. The Gibsons version introduced North and South Mercia, and rearranged the connection of areas around the Pennines, while changing marshy Somerset into lowlands and lowland Berkshire into highlands. This map, painted in dark shades of green and blue, was retained for later versions until the Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) version, which slightly changed the Pennines area again and cleared up the sea area connections in the Skye region. The Avalon Hill mapboard incorporated the Turn Record Chart down each side of the board. In previous versions the events of the game were listed on a card for each of the four players. The onboard Timeline was reimplemented by FFG, and their artwork for the land changed to predominantly yellow, with a rather enlarged map compared to previous versions. ; Colours : The original prototype used Blue, Red, Green and Yellow for the different player pieces. The first Gibsons version had Purple, Brown, Red and Blue, with the Brown pieces becoming Black in their later version and in the Welt der Spiele version. Avalon Hill changed these counters to Green. This led to players of the different versions calling this coalition 'BBG' or Brown-Black-Green. FFG then changed the Purple counters to Yellow. ; Scenario : In the prototype the Irish were allied to the Romans, and this was changed to the Irish joining the Red coalition in the Gibsons version, and all subsequent versions. For the non-standard games every version had slight changes to which nations were controlled by which player. Gibsons introduced a short game. Small changes were made to many of the forces arriving in the game between the prototype and the Gibsons version, and later for FFG's version, which also added more leaders. In FFG's version Round V became a Victory Point counting turn instead of Turn 4. The FFG version also includes several two-player games and a changed version of the short game. ; Rules : In 1983 the Invasions prototype was submitted by Lewis Pulsipher to Gibsons for evaluation and testing, and most development work was done by Roger Heyworth without referring back to the designer. This had been Pulsipher's last design before effectively retiring from game design. This led to a number of areas being confused and not entirely in line with the designer's intention. By 2004 when Pulsipher first saw the published version of Britannia being played at a convention he was surprised by some of the tactics that were allowed by the rules, especially in terms of their historicity. One major area of change between the intention of the prototype and the Gibsons and Avalon Hill versions was how raiding worked. In these games raiders could 'hang around forever' at sea without committing to landing. These and other areas in the rules were cleared up with the advent of the FFG version, reducing the need for players to clarify rules amongst themselves, as had been the case during the period between the Avalon Hill and FFG versions. The 2008 version removed any lingering detailed issues with the 2005 version, including the nation turn order listed on the map. ; New concepts : FFG's Britannia II has introduced the new concepts of Roman Roads and Roman Reinforcements, Belgae submission and the Boudiccan Rebellion, and a four kings ending instead of three, with the addition of Svein Estrithsson. Britannia II also includes rules for players to bid amongst themselves to take particular sides in an auction, in part to address any perceived imbalance between the colours.

The original line remained open as a means of bypassing the new Troon station, and also to serve Troon Goods station which was located slightly to the north of the closed passenger station. Today the goods station is also closed, and the line no longer carries through traffic. A long track from Barassie towards the station site still exists (plus several sidings), however it ends around the site of the goods station. This site was also used when the Ayrshire Coast Line was in the process of electrification as a maintenance depot for the equipment being used at the time. Once electrification was complete in 1986 the site was used as a civil engineers yard serving the nearby Shewalton tip and Hillhouse Quarry. This move resulted in the closure of the Irvine engineers yard.

According to judicial authorities, Andrianafidisoa was not allowed to run for president after failing to pay a 25 million ariary (US$11,400) deposit. Fidy had previously supported the incumbent President Marc Ravalomanana in his successful claim to the presidency in the wake of the disputed 2001 presidential election. Coup events General Fidy declared military rule and set up a base near the Ivato Airport in the capital, Antananarivo. There were police reports of shooting early in the morning of November 18, and that one soldier was killed and another wounded. President Ravalomanana was returning from France during the incident and his plane was diverted from Antananarivo to Mahajanga instead. Aftermath On November 19, 2006 the government said it was searching for General Fidy, and dozens of soldiers were stationed outside his house. Secretary of State for Public Security, Lucien Victor Razakanirina, told Reuters, \\"We issued a wanted poster for General Fidy for an attack on state security. We went to arrest General Fidy, but he was no longer at his house. He is very mobile.\\" Fidy told Reuters via telephone, \\"I am alive and I am not in hiding.

In a radio interview on November 20, Fidy, who had still not been captured, said that the idea that there had been a coup attempt was a misinterpretation, but acknowledged that he had called for Ravalomanana's resignation because he considered the government to be unconstitutional. On November 22, Fidy received the backing of most of the 14 presidential candidates, who said he was defending the constitution and the interests of the nation.\\"Support for Madagascar 'coup bid'\\", BBC News, November 23, 2006.\\"Madagascar: 11 candidats de l'opposition jugent l√©gitime l'action du g√©n√©ral \\"Fidy\\"\\" , AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), November 22, 2006 .

I used a couple of Seeburg record player changers to play 45s and several Ampex reel decks for commercials and we were in business,\\" Schafer said.  In the beginning  Originally, commercials had to be dubbed sequentially to play back in the right order. Before long, Schafer, with the help of Chief Engineer Jim Harford, designed a better system. The \\"spotter\\" used Ampex reel-to-reel tape decks that could fast forward and rewind to count windows cut from the tape in order to locate specific commercials. \\"We removed about an inch of the oxide from the tape every minute. The 'windows' were then counted by the automation system as they passed between a lamp and a photocell to find the right commercial to play,\\" Schafer said. The Schafer Automation System used a series of relays and stepping switches and a clock that allowed programmers to back- time music to join network newscasts without having to fade the music. Schafer said the automation system consisted of two racks: one held the \\"brain,\\" another contained three tape reel-to-reel decks. The Seeburg record player changers held 100 records each. Programming the system was limited at the beginning. The front control panel consisted of a series of pins to allow programmers to change a sequence or repeat it, Schafer said. \\"They could set up a pattern by screwing pins into any of the many holes in the clock. Typically this would be each 15 or 30 minutes to play station breaks,\\" Schafer said. Silence trigger In the original Schafer Automation System, the switching from one event to the next was triggered by silence. \\"Whenever silence was sensed the system would step to the next event. There would be the occasional record with a pause that would give us fits, of course,\\" Schafer said. To remedy that problem, Schafer introduced a system using a 25 Hz tone at or near the end of an event on reel-to-reel tape. The tones, which were inaudible to listeners, allowed for overlapping of events and made the system sound better, he said. \\"The system used stepping switches, like the ones telephone companies used at the time. After the tone or silence, the next element was triggered, which was determined by the setting of switches on the front panel,\\" Schafer said. Eventually, Schafer's automation system used Viking cartridge decks and then Sono Mag Corp. carousels for commercial playback. Ultimately, broadcasters dubbed music onto reels, which improved the reliability of the automation system and meant the 45s no longer wore out, Schafer said. \\"For about the first five years after we introduced automation to the radio industry, we were the only ones producing anything of the kind. We sold direct and through Gates, Collins, RCA and IGM,\\" Schafer said. To help spread the word of his innovation, Schafer had three motor homes traveling the country demonstrating Schafer Automation Systems to radio broadcasters. \\"The idea was so new, it was the only way to get the idea of automation across,\\" he said. In early 1959, Schafer purchased a radio station of his own to help demonstrate how efficiently a station could be run with automation. The station, KDOT(AM) in Reno, Nev., operated with a staff of three. \\"The manager did the selling, the engineer was also the announcer and one office manager ran things in fine fashion,\\" he said. His company sold more than 1,000 versions of its automation design, including the Schafer Model 800, probably the most reliable of them all, Schafer said. In fact, some are still in operation at radio stations in Mexico, he said. Schafer sold Schafer Electronics in 1968, about the time the company was beginning to work on a computer-driven automation system. Applied Magnetics owned the company for a few years before selling to Cetec. Not one for retirement, Schafer started his current company, Schafer International, in 1969. In 1986 he founded Schafer Digital, where he worked on a new design for a PC-based automation and traffic system. He sold a few systems and then sold the company, he said. Schafer's background is steeped in broadcast engineering and goes back to his hometown of Hammond, Ind., where he learned to fix radios as a teen at a repair shop. \\"I was building crystal sets and generally fascinated with making radios work and listening to them. Radio was very, very young at the time,\\" Schafer said. Schafer received his first FCC operator's license in 1942 and went to work for his hometown radio station WJOB(AM). He was delighted to bring home $35 a week playing 78 rpm records and 16-inch transcription discs. The following year, Schafer went to work for WOWO(AM) in Fort Wayne, Ind. The 10 KW station served as a good training ground for a young engineer. Station engineer \\"I learned how to change the big water-cooled tubes in the transmitter that took up two complete floors of a very large building. Very fun,\\" he said. After a stint in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, Schafer returned to WANE(AM) in Fort Wayne where he worked on the air, sold commercial time and fixed the equipment. \\"I became a combo operator of sorts. Times were tight and stations couldn't afford an engineer and announcer. I was an engineer sitting between two turntables and with a microphone in front of me,\\" he said. After WANE was sold, Schafer moved south to Norfolk, Va., to be chief engineer and assistant manager of WNOR(AM). Schafer set out for California in 1951 and landed a job with NBC Hollywood, then home to some of the biggest radio shows off the day, as a summer vacation relief engineer. \\"Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. I think those were the last of the golden years of radio. It was fantastic,\\" Schafer said. It was while at NBC that Schafer became aware of a new FCC ruling allowing for radio stations that were nondirectional and 10 KW or less to operate transmitters unattended by remote control. With the help of fellow NBC engineer Bill Amidon, Schafer ordered two phone lines installed between his garage and Amidon's basement. Stepping switch \\"The key was you had to be able to meter and simultaneously you had to be able to raise and lower and turn things on or off. The logical way to do it was with a stepping switch,\\" Schafer said. Using an old rotary phone dial, Schafer incorporated relays to raise or lower a specific element after a number was dialed. \\"You could dial up number one for plate voltage, maybe two was plate current and maybe three was antenna current. A little meter would show the reading. Then we would have the relays set up to do the function,\\" Schafer said. The Schafer remote control system marked the birth of Schafer Electronics in 1953. After working out the bugs the first remote control unit was installed at KROW(AM) in Oakland, Calif., Schafer said. It wasn't until 1957 that the FCC amended the rules to allow for the remote control of all broadcast transmitters, thanks in part to NAB field tests filed in 1955 using Schafer remote control systems. Besides building remote-control equipment and automation systems, Schafer was instrumental in assisting the FCC in field tests demonstrating the worthiness of FM in 1965. \\"Prose Walker was director of engineering for NAB and wanted to show the world that the United States' proposed standard for broadcasting FM should be adopted by the world. He thought it would help if we could feed a stereo signal to a satellite and get it back,\\" Schafer said. Schafer used several Ampex portable recorders in the middle of the Mojave Desert near Barstow, Calif., to record music and chronicle the tests. The recordings later were played for international engineering groups throughout Europe. There are those in broadcasting who complain that the automation system Schafer developed more than 45 years ago has led to today's widespread use of voice tracking, which has cost jobs and created a shortage of young talent. \\"What you hear on the air in most markets today can be attributed to Mr. Schafer ... automation that plays the same mindless drool from a satellite or hard drive,\\" said Jay Swafford, a former on-air personality and program director in several markets, including Nashville, Tenn. \\"Nowhere have I found that Mr. Schafer's invention added to the listenability of radio, just the enhancement of the bottom line for the corporate office. \\"Kids have no idea how much fun radio used to be when personality got a chance to shine through the airwaves,\\" Swafford said, who is an audio technician at WTVF-TV in Nashville. Schafer said he heard many of the same complaints when his automation system became popular. \\"In the early days of automation, each station produced what their automation system could assemble. Some of the less-creative air talent created material that was far from the best. I guess it will always be that way,\\" Schafer said. Programming enhancements Schafer foresees even more changes for the broadcast industry thanks to advances in automation technology. \\"Great minds will continue to find ways to enhance programming, automation and other aspects of broadcasting,\\" he said. Schafer, the father of five grown children, lives in Bonita, Calif. One of his sons, Rob, followed him in broadcast engineering and is currently acting director of technical operations for CBS- TV Newspath in New York. And his son Christopher is the webmaster for the www.schaferinternational.com website. Paul Schafer, age 76, received the NAB Radio Engineering Achievement Award in 2002. The award, given to industry leaders for significant contributions to the advancement of broadcast engineering, recognizes Schafer for six decades of broadcast experience, including his work in the development of on-air automation systems and remote- control equipment for radio. His friends in broadcasting say Schafer's influence has been felt throughout the industry thanks to his technical innovations. Others decry automation, saying it helped to spur the end of unique local radio programming and led to fewer on-air jobs and the rise of sparsely manned or unattended stations that use automated programming. Most industry observers would agree that the Schafer Automation System forever changed the way radio operators run their stations. \\"His systems were well- built with first class parts. His concepts, now in computer form, are the foundation of many radio stations today,\\" said Andy Laird, vice president of radio engineering for the Radio Journal Broadcast Group and a member of the NAB award nominating committee. In 1962, I worked as the radio station engineer due to my new FCC Radio telephone First Class license having just graduated from the don martin audio and TV school, Hollywood on the GI bill. plus I was the only announcer. the rest of the staff, Radio Station Manager, Salesman, and other staff members were all let go. My duties were to change the tape reels and put new 45 rpm little top 40 records into an automated jute box wired to the console. As I recall it had lots of blue tubes lighting the rack of controls in a huge tall locker. This was my first job just out of the Army, as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio & TV. So it was a big deal to me. I enjoyed giving the call letters KDOT each morning and reading the news live on the air however all the music was on automated tape. Sadly we had very few sponsors and thus hardly any commercials. Sadly the Schafer radio station was, owned by the Schafer company, which was out of town in California not Reno Nevada. The job only lasted a few months station was going broke. Soon the station closed due to money problems. However Mr. Schafer phoned me to try and stay on the air as he d he would try to get the funds to keep the station going but it was already to late. The local Power company in Reno shut of the current to the transmitter (the antenna was some way out of town) . When I left the front door was locked (no rear exit) and I returned to LA by auto. Driving out of town the music was still on the car radio but slowly faded out as I drove along the highway. The good news is; I soon worked at another radio station in Santa Monica, Ca that used the same Schafer automation system but was owned by other private party's the call letters were KSRF FM. This was over 50 years ago.

Important engineers on the project included Fred Brooks and Gerry Blaauw. The project plan for the 8000 series was presented by Fred Brooks in January, 1961. Despite some technical successes, the project became a political football, amid IBM's search for a unified product line. The project was canceled in 1961 by Bob Evans, supplanted by the successful System/360 series. The 8000 project may have seen the first use of the term \\"architecture\\" in relation to computers. Problems Pugh cites a number of reasons for the cancellation of the 8000 line. * Because more integrated technology was not yet available the system was to have been built using discrete transistor (SMS) components. * The proposed systems would have been incompatible with IBM's existing successful 1400 series systems. * The proposed instruction set was too complex. * The systems offered inadequate floating point performance, bolstered only by add-on processors. 8000 components Unlike System/360 which offered a series of processors with a common architecture, the 8000 was designed with a single main processor to which external components could be added to increase performance. The components identified were: * 8103 Processor * 8104 Processor * 8106 Processor * 8108 High Speed Floating Point Unit * 8112 High Speed Floating Point Unit =8103= The 8103 was proposed as a low-end processor \\"to relieve the larger systems of the series from the tasks associated with input-output processing.\\" The 8103 was to have featured a 4 K or 8 K 8 Œºs magnetic-core memory, organized as 16 bit words of two eight bit bytes. The system could also share 2 Œºs core memory with larger processors. Memory was organized into segments -- segment size is unspecified in the proposal. The 8103 was to be multiprogrammed to support its mission as an input/output or front end processor. It appears that task switching was to be automatic under hardware control. =8104= The proposed specifications for the 8104 appear similar to the 8103. It featured a full complement of instructions for fixed and floating point arithmetic and storage-to-storage character operations. All instructions were 32 bits in length. The 8104 supported direct addressing, indirect addressing, and indexed addressing with 255 index registers. =8106= The 8106 was to have been the principal processor in the 8000 line, designed to bracket the performance of the IBM 7090 system. The 8106 used a 64 bit word in one or more storage units of 4 K, 8 K, or 16 K words of core memory with an access time of 2 Œºs. Some of the storage units were supposed to be able to have been shared with other processors in the product line. Instructions could be one, two, or three 32-bit halfwords in length, allowing one, two, or three address instructions respectively. The system used nonpaged virtual memory, addressing blocks of 256 words through an address translation table. =8108= The 8108 was an \\"attachment to the 8106 machine\\" designed to greatly improve the performance of floating-point arithmetic. For example, the 8106 was to have performed a twelve digit floating-point multiply in 280 Œºs. The 8108 reduced this to 24 Œºs. =8112= The 8112 was also a high speed floating point processor.

It is common to use the finite element method (FEM) to perform this analysis because, like other calculations using the FEM, the object being analyzed can have arbitrary shape and the results of the calculations are acceptable. The types of equations which arise from modal analysis are those seen in eigensystems. The physical interpretation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which come from solving the system are that they represent the frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Sometimes, the only desired modes are the lowest frequencies because they can be the most prominent modes at which the object will vibrate, dominating all the higher frequency modes. It is also possible to test a physical object to determine its natural frequencies and mode shapes. This is called an Experimental Modal Analysis. The results of the physical test can be used to calibrate a finite element model to determine if the underlying assumptions made were correct (for example, correct material properties and boundary conditions were used).  FEA eigensystems  For the most basic problem involving a linear elastic material which obeys Hooke's Law, the matrix equations take the form of a dynamic three-dimensional spring mass system. The generalized equation of motion is given as:Clough, Ray W. and Joseph Penzien, Dynamics of Structures, 2nd Ed., McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, New York, 1993, page 173 : [M] [\\\\ddot U] + [C] [\\\\dot U] + [K] [U] = [F] where [M] is the mass matrix, [\\\\ddot U] is the 2nd time derivative of the displacement [U] (i.e., the acceleration), [\\\\dot U] is the velocity, [C] is a damping matrix, [K] is the stiffness matrix, and [F] is the force vector. The general problem, with nonzero damping, is a quadratic eigenvalue problem. However, for vibrational modal analysis, the damping is generally ignored, leaving only the 1st and 3rd terms on the left hand side: : [M] [\\\\ddot U] + [K] [U] = [0] This is the general form of the eigensystem encountered in structural engineering using the FEM. To represent the free- vibration solutions of the structure harmonic motion is assumed,Bathe, Klaus J√ºrgen, Finite Element Procedures, 2nd Ed., Prentice-Hall Inc., New Jersey, 1996, page 786 so that [\\\\ddot U] is taken to equal \\\\lambda [U], where \\\\lambda is an eigenvalue (with units of reciprocal time squared, e.g., \\\\mathrm{s}^{-2}), and the equation reduces to:Clough, Ray W. and Joseph Penzien, Dynamics of Structures, 2nd Ed., McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, New York, 1993, page 201 :[M][U] \\\\lambda + [K][U] = [0] In contrast, the equation for static problems is: : [K][U] = [F] which is expected when all terms having a time derivative are set to zero. = Comparison to linear algebra = In linear algebra, it is more common to see the standard form of an eigensystem which is expressed as: :[A][x] = [x]\\\\lambda Both equations can be seen as the same because if the general equation is multiplied through by the inverse of the mass, [M]^{-1} , it will take the form of the latter.Thomson, William T., Theory of Vibration with Applications, 3rd Ed., Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, 1988, page 165 Because the lower modes are desired, solving the system more likely involves the equivalent of multiplying through by the inverse of the stiffness, [K]^{-1} , a process called inverse iteration.Hughes, Thomas J. R., The Finite Element Method, Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, 1987 page 582-584 When this is done, the resulting eigenvalues, \\\\mu , relate to that of the original by: : \\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} but the eigenvectors are the same.

Early life Rosenberg, born in New York City, attended Brooklyn College (BA, 1946), the University of Wisconsin (MA, 1948), and the University of Michigan (PhD, 1953). He began his teaching career as an Instructor in Psychology at the University of Michigan (1952‚Äì54).John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Reports of the President and of the Treasurer, p. 107. Education career Rosenberg was a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Chicago, where he served as the director of the doctoral program in Social and Organizational Psychology. Prior to coming to Chicago in the mid-1960s, he taught at Yale (1954‚Äì61), Ohio State University (1961‚Äì63), and Dartmouth College (1963‚Äì65). For a brief period Rosenberg served on the staff of the Naval War College, and he has lectured at various other universities both in the United States and abroad. He served on the Board of Trustees of Chicago's Shimer College in the late 2000s. Articles Rosenberg wrote many articles in professional journals and political magazines. He also wrote, coauthored, or edited a number of books, including: Attitude Organization and Change; Theories of Cognitive Consistency; Domestic Sources of Foreign Policy; Beyond Conflict and Containment: Critical Studies of Military and Foreign Policy; and Vietnam and the Silent Majority. One of his areas of study was cognitive dissonance and attitude change, on which he worked closely with Robert P. Abelson, among others.  Radio show  From 1973 until December 20, 2012, he hosted WGN Radio's \\"Extension 720,\\" a two-hour discussion show with one hour reserved for call-ins. The program, which aired Sunday through Thursday (originally Monday through Friday) from 10 p.m. to midnight (an hour later than formerly), dealt with topics ranging from politics to financial investment to entertainment to religion to foreign policy to literature, and, as Milt says, \\"just about everything except pop psychology and poodle- trimming.\\" Calling upon journalists, academics, corporate types and just about any and every profession, Extension 720 provided highly varied nightly shows. Some of the programs heard during 2004 were: Is War Dead?, The Iran Enigma, Crazy Horse and the Wars of the Plains, The Rise and Fall of Communism, The Changing Face of Chicago, The Films of Francis Ford Coppola, Stem Cell Research, A Night at the Opera, Bush's War Cabinet, Shakespeare's Tragedies, The Undergraduate Life, Avoiding Con Artists, Nanotechnology, The Language of the Presidency, Great Gospel Music, Contemporary Russia and The Origin and Descent of Man. Past guests of note include such political figures as Margaret Thatcher, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, George Stephanopoulos, George Shultz, Cyrus Vance (and many members of the Senate and House of Representatives). Other interesting public figures who have appeared on the program include Colin Powell, Charlton Heston, William Safire, Bill Murray, William Bennett, Richard Posner, Bob Feller, Betty Friedan, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Cynthia Ozick, Norman Mailer, Mary Higgins Clark, Calvin Trillin, P.D.

On December 17, 2012, WGN announced that Rosenberg would retire from his daily show on December 20, 2012. However, although he will no longer be a full-time program host, the station's leaders announced that he would remain a show contributor and have a presence at the station. However, it appears that Rosenberg did not have any continuing relationship with WGN after his forced retirement.

The company was founded in the late-1960s by radio programmer and deejay Bill Drake (1937‚Äì2008), and his business partner, Lester Eugene Chenault (1919‚Äì2010). Drake-Chenault was the predecessor of Jones Radio Networks with its syndicated satellite-delivered formats. History In the 1940s and 1950s, FM radio stations began to appear all over the US, generally alongside a sister AM station. Most stations held their FM license by simulcasting the programming of the AM sister station. In the 1960s the FCC introduced a rule that prohibited owners of AM and FM stations from simulcasting in an attempt to increase variety of programming and generate FM listenership. The FM audience share at that time was very small. Since the AM and FM stations aired the same programming, there was little reason to listen to FM. The rule targeted major markets first and had a \\"roll-out\\" period of several years with a smaller percentage of simulcasting allowed each year and smaller markets coming under the rule. When station operators chose what format to air on the FM stations, one of the objectives was to not compete with the AM station. During this time AM stations could target big audiences so stations could be categorized with broad definitions such as MOR, top 40 and country/western. So \\"counter-programming\\" the FM was simple. A broadcaster with a youth-targeted Top 40 AM station would likely target an older demographic on the sister FM, or vice versa if the AM was an older-targeted MOR station. Nearly every large market had a \\"progressive rock\\" album station, a forerunner to AOR, and a \\"beautiful\\" music station. Both approaches had some early success. The baby boomers gravitated to the better audio quality, fewer commercials and \\"hipness\\" of the free-form rock stations. Older FM listeners embraced the lush sounds and fewer commercials of beautiful music stations. Many offices and retail stores used the \\"beautiful\\" stations as free background music. The station operators also wanted to be able to run the FM stations inexpensively. There wasn't the revenue from FM to support a \\"live\\" presentation with another staff of announcers. The result was the birth of automated equipment and the pre-recorded, syndicated format business. The automation systems usually consisted of 3 or 4 reel-to-reel tape decks, playing 10.5\\" or 14\\" reels containing the music, and several tape cartridge decks for commercials, weather, promos, etc. The early systems were \\"pre- computer\\" and simply sequenced pre-selected events that were triggered by an inaudible tone. Depending on the automation supplier and the quantity of tape decks, a system would cost $18,000-$30,000. The early syndication format suppliers included Bonneville, Schulke, Triangle, IGM, TM, Drake-Chenault and others. Drake-Chenault (D-C) entered the business only to record music on tape for the RKO FM stations. D-C was a consultant for the RKO chain on the AM side and the aforementioned FCC rule was impacting the RKO FM stations. Music tapes were recorded at Gene Chenault's KYNO in Fresno, located on Barton Avenue. Under the name of Barton Industries in the late 60's, format syndication was born. The first format was Hitparade which aired on KHJ-FM in Los Angeles. In the early 70s with AM and FM stations in all market sizes coming under the FCC rule and following the large market model, Drake-Chenault entered the radio syndication business in earnest, making taped formats available to non-RKO stations. Drake-Chenault syndication established a studio at 8399 Topanga Canyon Blvd. in Canoga Park, CA. Among the early format offerings were Classic Gold, created for KHJ-FM (which became KRTH), Solid Gold, Hitparade and Great American Country. The original 48-hour History of Rock and Roll, which had been created for KHJ, was made available nationwide, and was followed by other syndicated \\"special\\" programs. James Kefford, who became the company's President, joined the firm in 1973 and teamed up with the automation suppliers to visit radio station owners and detail the benefits of using the automation system and the Drake Chenault programmers. Bill Drake and Gene Chenault tapped Kefford to spearhead the next growth phase for the company in 1977. By the late 70's, with a staff of regional managers, programming consultants, production engineers and administrative personnel the Drake Chenault format client list grew to over 300, with many of the consulted stations number one in their markets. The company was sold to Albuquerque-based Wagontrain Communications in March 1985. Senior VP Denny Adkins, who had joined D-C in 1976 as a national programming consultant and ultimately oversaw the creation and content of all format programming, was named president. Drake-Cheanult was relocated to Albuquerque in the summer of 1986 along with Dallas-based TM Programming, which had also been acquired by Wagontrain. \\"Behind the scenes in the production dept\\" Retrieved 2 March 2015TM Programming was renamed Programming Consultants after the acquisition. The plan of having the two once-solid companies occupy the same building and compete while sharing administration, production and other support departments to reduce expenses didn't work. While some attribute satellite radio programming as the reason for their demise, debt service smothered the companies and they were ultimately broken up, with BPI Programming and Jones Radio (later absorbed by Oaktree Capital Management's Triton Media Group) picking up the pieces. Documentaries In 1978, Drake-Chenault released and syndicated an all-new, 52-hour edition of the definitive rock documentary, The History of Rock & Roll, a concept originally created by Ron Jacobs and Bill Drake at KHJ in 1969. The new version was researched and written by Gary Theroux, who co- produced it with Drake, who supplied the narration. The rockumentary's most famous (and most heavily bootlegged) feature was the final hour, the brainchild of Theroux. His original format for the special consisted of a series of half-hour or hour-long themed segments, mostly spotlighting key hitmakers (Elvis Presley, The Beatles, etc.) or key trends (folk-rock, soul music, etc.) He also created a series of half-hours which spotlit individual years and key hits released within them. To supplement those, Theroux had built what he called A and B montages. The A montages consisted of every #1 hit of that year in chronological order. The B montages were made up of other memorable hits there was simply no time to play in full. \\"Our crew worked day and night on the production,\\" recalled Theroux, \\"resulting in the girlfriend of one of our engineers complaining that she never got to see him. To explain what he'd been up to, the engineer made a copy of the A montage element tape reel, took it home and set it up to play for her while he went out and picked up a pizza. Upon his return, he found his girlfriend sitting cross-legged in front of the speakers with tears in her eyes. 'What's wrong?\\" he said. 'Oh my God,' she replied. 'I've just been listening to my life passing before my ears.' When the engineer told me that story, I knew instantly how we would end the special -- by editing all those #1 hit A montages together.\\" The resulting 45-minute montage inspired a whole series of later medley hits by everyone from Elvis Presley to The Beatles, Stars on 45 to Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers. Theroux's landmark rockumentary debuted as a weekend marathon broadcast over more than 800 foreign and domestic stations and went on to win Billboard magazine's \\"Top Special Program of The Year\\" award. It also sparked Theroux to write the book The Top Ten: 1956-Present, which reveals the sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes outrageous but always insightful stories behind the ten biggest hit records of each year since 1956. Theroux, who owns the \\"History of Rock 'n' Roll\\" trademark, today hosts a minute daily syndicated version of \\"The History of Rock 'n' Roll\\". Because the History was in pre-production when Elvis Presley died in August 1977, a completely new 3-hour Elvis special was able to be written, produced, duplicated and shipped within 48 hours of Elvis' death to several hundred radio stations. It was narrated by Bill Drake and slightly condensed to fit into \\"The History of Rock 'n' Roll\\". Drake-Chenault also produced the multi-part hour-long series \\"The Golden Years\\" and \\"The Golden Years of Country\\" as well as Mark Elliot's \\"Weekly Top 30\\" (from 1979 to 1982) and its successor, Charlie Van Dyke's \\"Weekly Music Magazine\\".

Bizarre manifestations of her dedication persuaded her parents that marriage was the only means of normalising her. On 19 January 1907 Tillyard reluctantly married Greco- American Constantine Cleanthes Graham (born Michaelides); they had two daughters, Elizabeth Mary Alethea in 1908 and Aelfrida Catharine Agatha in 1910. From 1907 until 1914 the Grahams lived in Russia, the United States, Germany and France as Constantine's Consular Service career dictated. After 1910 Tillyard and the children remained in Cambridge. During the war and thereafter Tillyard claimed to experience unwanted and sometimes unwelcome visits from dead persons known to or hitherto unknown by her; these included members of her family, former members of the Society for Psychical Research, Rupert Brooke and Roger Casement. Already under strain because of Constantine's infidelities and Tillyard's moral and religious obsessions, the Grahams' marriage broke down irretrievably following her brief but influential foray into esotericism under the guidance of occultist Aleister Crowley in 1913. Her compulsion to reveal marital discord and her own extramarital relationships in anthologies published in 1910, 1913 and 1916 also contributed to the failure of her marriage. The Grahams divorced in 1921. Constantine's consular career kept him abroad thereafter until his death in Berlin in 1934. Unlike her former husband, Tillyard never remarried but continued a series of intense friendships with younger men begun during her marriage, most notably with Ernest Altounyan, Hubert Henderson, Thomas Henn, John Layard, Juan Mascaro and Giovanni Papini. She also conducted one such friendship with a younger woman and one with the older French author Albert Erlande. Work In 1917 Tillyard came out as a mystic. Having already begun to record her mystico-spiritual experiences and their psychophysical manifestations in detailed diaries intended for posthumous publication, she also began to transcribe them in more or less fictionalised form in novels, homiletic books and moralistic short stories written between 1917 and 1958, some published, some not. In 1926 she wrote a biography of her aunt, Agnes Elizabeth Slack who campaigned for temperance. She documenting her aunt's travels to speak about temperance in Ireland, Canada, America, Scandinavia and South Africa. Following Alfred and Catharine Tillyard's respective deaths in 1929 and 1932, she decided to absolve herself of responsibility for her home and daughters in order to pursue her private and personal 'mystic way'. She was nevertheless dismayed when her daughters abandoned her, Alethea by becoming a nun and missionary, Agatha by suicide. In pursuit of her 'closer walk with God' Tillyard also became an Anglo-Catholic and (briefly) an extern oblate of St Mary's Abbey, West Malling, Kent. Tillyard wrote two science fiction novels articulating her conservative political views. Concrete: A Story of Two Hundred Years Hence (1930) is set in an anti-religious dystopia controlled by the eugenics movement. The novel includes a character called \\"Big Brother\\" who leads a \\"Ministry of Reason\\" and there is also a propaganda department called the \\"Ministry of Aesthetics\\". The Approaching Storm (1932) is another dystopia set in a Britain ruled by a left-wing dictatorship.Nan Bowman Albinski, \\"Thomas and Peter: Society and Politics in Four British Utopian Novels\\".

She remained there as resident tertiary until asked to leave in 1946. From 1946 to 1953 she lived a semi-reclusive and prayerful but troubled life in two clergy houses in Cambridgeshire, effected a degree of rapprochement with her surviving daughter, and enjoyed a close relationship with her elder brother. In 1953 increasing bodily infirmity forced a move to St John's Home in Oxford where she died 6 acrimonious years later.

Fleming John Vincent Fleming is an American literary critic and the Louis W. Fairchild '24 Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Emeritus, at Princeton University. Career Fleming graduated from The University of the South in 1958. After studying at Jesus College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, Fleming earned his Ph.D. in medieval literature from Princeton University in 1963 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"The Roman de la Rose and its manuscript illustrations\\", under the supervision of D. W. Robertson, Jr. He spent two years as an Instructor in English at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison before returning to Princeton as an assistant professor of English in 1965. Beginning in 1978 he took up a joint appointment in the Department of Comparative Literature. His fields of expertise included medieval English, French, and Latin literatures, and the history and culture of the Franciscan Order in the Middle Ages. He is perhaps best known in Princeton for his popular and erudite lecture course on Geoffrey Chaucer. From 1995 to 2006, he authored a weekly column in The Daily Princetonian, titled \\"Gladly Lerne, Gladly Teche\\" (a reference to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales). He has revived his column under its same name as a blog attached to his website, www.johnvfleming.com. He served for several years as a Commissioner of Higher Education of Middle States. He was active in numerous learned societies, including the Medieval Academy of America, which he served as its President. Fleming is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society. At Princeton, he was the dissertation director of renowned scholars of medieval literature Carolyn Dinshaw (New York University) and Steven Justice (University of California, Berkeley). He is married to the Rev. Joan E. Fleming, a retired priest in the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey. They are the parents of Richard Arthur Fleming (b. 1964), a sound-recording engineer, artist, and travel writer; Katherine Elizabeth Fleming (b. 1966), a prize-winning historian and university administrator; and Luke Owles Fleming (b. 1978), a linguistic anthropologist. While at Princeton, his wit was widely appreciated and often recorded in a sporadic column titled \\"Professorial Chrestomathy,\\" including such remarks from his lectures as \\"As of this morning, you have heard all my jokes and seen all my shirts.\\" In 2006, after 40 years at Princeton, he moved to emeritus status. Following his retirement, he was honored with two festschrift volumes prepared by former students and other colleagues. The first, Defenders and Critics of Franciscan Life: Essays in Honor of John V. Fleming, ed. Michael F. Cusato and Guy Geltner (Brill: 2009), reflects his work in Franciscan Studies. The second, Sacred and Profane in Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature: Essays in Honour of John V. Fleming, ed. Robert Epstein and William Robins (Toronto: 2010), reflects his contributions to the study of medieval English vernacular literature. He is an elected member of The Guild of Scholars of The Episcopal Church. In 2008 he was inducted as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In retirement Fleming has expanded his field of scholarly publication beyond medieval subjects. His first trade book, a study of classic anti-Communist literature entitled The Anti-Communist Manifestos was published in New York by W. W. Norton in August, 2009. In 2010 it was awarded the annual book prize of the New Jersey Council for the Humanities.

It was directed by Lloyd French, produced by Hal Roach and distributed by MGM.  Plot  Laurel and Hardy are partners in a barbershop. Stan reads a classified ad in the newspaper from a wealthy widow (Mae Busch) looking for a new husband. Initially, only Stan plans to respond to the ad but after explaining his plans to Ollie (leading to the third use of the team's trademark \\"Tell me that again\\" routine, used previously in Towed in a Hole, The Devil's Brother, and subsequently in The Fixer Uppers) they both decide to answer the ad, shaking hands in agreement, and with Ollie saying \\"May the best man win.\\" However, Ollie cheats on this agreement by mailing only his own response, and hiding Stan's in his hat. Ollie then settles into the barber's chair for Stan to shave him, and inadvertently dozes off. The widow invites Ollie to her mansion, and Ollie announces himself with his full true name. Oliver Norvell Hardy, the only film in which this happens. Stan discovers his unmailed response, he also goes along and demands half of whatever Ollie gets. At the widow's mansion, Laurel and Hardy encounter a deranged butler (Jack Barty) who pantomimes card tricks with imaginary cards, and serves an imaginary meal. The same butler tips off Stan and Ollie that the widow is a serial murderess, who had previously slit the throats of seven prior fianc√©s, all named Oliver. Laurel and Hardy are sent upstairs, as the widow tells her butler to make sure all the doors and windows are locked. She tells Ollie, \\"I hope you have a nice, long sleep\\", as the butler plays \\"Taps\\" (a bugle call played at dusk) on a trumpet. Unable to escape their bedroom, Stan finds a pump-action shotgun, leading to some slapstick mishaps, including Stan accidentally shooting Ollie in the foot (which he mistook for a man's hand). They plan to take turns sleeping, so that one of them can watch out for the knife-wielding widow. Ollie sets up a Rube Goldberg-style contraption to help Stan to stay awake. Tying a gold coated brick to a string, suspending it above Stan's head and then tying the other end of the string round a lit candle. Ollie then explains to Stan that he must periodically move the string in order to prevent the candle's flame burning through the string, resulting in the brick falling on Stan's head. As usual, things go awry with the brick falling on Ollie's head, knocking him unconscious. Moments later the widow is heard walking up the stairs, sharpening a long knife. When Stan goes to get the shotgun, he gets locked in the closet as the widow enters the room. As she is about to slit Ollie's throat, a loud offscreen crash is heard. Suddenly, Stan and Ollie are back at their barbershop, and Ollie leaps out of his chair, screaming and runs to the mirror to examine his throat.

It begins at an intersection with NY 22 in the Columbia County hamlet of Austerlitz and ends at a junction with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in the Rensselaer County village of Nassau. NY 203 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Prior to that time, the section of NY 203 east of Valatie was part of NY 22\\\\. The road runs northwest-southeast, and is signed east-west east of Valatie and north-south north of Valatie. Route description NY 203 begins at an intersection with NY 22 in the town of Austerlitz. NY 203 proceeds northwest and downtown into the hamlet of Spencertown. Spencertown consists of several homes situated around the intersection of NY 203 and Fire Hill Road. The two- lane route winds its way west through the town of Austerlitz, passing through woods and residences for several miles. At the intersection with Jugway Road, NY 203 bends northwest, entering a large hamlet at the intersection with County Route 7 (CR 7; South Street). Residences surround NY 203 as it heads northeast, before starting to space north of Goodrich Lane. The route winds its way to the northwest, becoming more rural as it enters an intersection with CR 9 in the hamlet of Moorhouse Corner. NY 203 at the junction with NY 66 in Chatham Still in the town of Austerlitz, NY 203 bends northwest from CR 9 and enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Taconic State Parkway before intersecting with CR 61 (Hogel Hill Road) nearby. After CR 61, NY 203 makes a dart to the southwest into the town of Ghent, running around a hillside before turning northwest into the village of Chatham. In Chatham, NY 203 gains the moniker of Coleman Street, intersecting with NY 66 (Hudson Avenue), where it changes names to Church Street. Proceeding west through Chatham, the route becomes a two-lane commercial and residential strip before leaving the village for Ghent once again. Out of Chatham, NY 203 drops the Church Street moniker, winding its way northwest along a freight line into the town of Chatham. In the town of Chatham, NY 203 bends northwest then west as it becomes more rural. A short distance later, NY 203 intersects with CR 21B in the town of Kinderhook. At CR 21B, NY 203 winds northward through Kinderhook as a two-lane rural roadway, bending northwest at a junction with Merwin Road. NY 203 proceeds west, passing north of Winding Brook Country Club and soon into the village of Valatie. In Valatie, NY 203 gains the moniker of Chatham Street, proceeding north as a two-lane residential street. After crossing a creek in the middle of the village, NY 203 enters downtown Valatie, intersecting with Main Street, which proceeds westward to connect with US 9\\\\. NY 203 however proceeds eastward along Main, crossing an intersection that leads to CR 28A (Upper Main Street). NY 203 proceeds north on Mechanic Street, a two-lane commercial street in the northeastern corner of the village. At Church Street, the route bends northeast, leaving downtown Valatie and soon back into the town of Kinderhook. In Kinderhook, NY 203 becomes a two-lane residential street, passing southeast of the hamlet of Valatie Corner and into a junction with CR 28 (Main Street / Newton Hill Road). The northwestern terminus of NY 203 at US 20 in Nassau After CR 28, NY 203 bends northeast, crossing under the freight line and running along the eastern side of Niverville. After Niverville, NY 203 crosses back into the town of Chatham, passing along the eastern shore of Kinderhook Lake as a two-lane residential street. The route bends away from the lake, soon bending northeast into a junction with CR 17\\\\. At CR 17, NY 203 bends northward into the hamlet of North Chatham. In North Chatham, NY 203 is a two-lane residential strip, intersecting with CR 32 at the north end of the hamlet. At CR 32, NY 203 darts northeast, intersecting with another segment of CR 32 before turning north and crossing the county line into Rensselaer County. After crossing the county line, NY 203 crosses under the Berkshire Spur of the New York State Thruway (I-90) in the town of Nassau. After the Thruway, NY 203 remains a dense wooded road, winding its way northward along the Valatie Kill. The route passes a large cemetery and several residences as it bends northeast, entering the village of Nassau. In Nassau, NY 203 has the moniker of Chatham Street, becoming a two-lane residential strip before intersecting with US 20 (Albany Avenue / Church Street) in downtown. This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY 203. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 1, an unsigned legislative route extending from New York City to Albany along the eastern fringe of New York. Route 1 mostly followed what is now NY 22 from New York City to Austerlitz, where it turned west and continued to Valatie on modern NY 203\\\\. The route left NY 203 at Main Street and continued to Albany on current US 9. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, most of legislative Route 1 south of NY 23 in Hillsdale became NY 22. The remainder of old Route 1 between Hillsdale and Valatie became part of an extended NY 22 in the late 1920s. NY 22 was realigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue north from Austerlitz to the Canadian border near Mooers by way of the eastern edge of the state. Most of NY 22's former routing between Valatie and Austerlitz became part of NY 203, a new route extending from Austerlitz to Nassau via Valatie. The short segment of former NY 22 along Main Street in Valatie from Kinderhook Street (US 9) to Chatham Street (NY 203) did not receive a designation and is now NY 980B, an unsigned reference route.

Hyatt Mayor described the three most recent acquisitions (Mayor, \\"Giulio Campagnola\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, 32.8 (August 1937:192-196). prints translated the rich Venetian Renaissance style of oil paintings of Giorgione and the early Titian into the medium of engraving; to further his exercises in gradations of tone, he also invented the stipple technique, where multitudes of tiny dots or dashes allow smooth graduations of tone in the essentially linear technique of engraving; variations on this discovery were to be of huge importance in future printmaking. He was the adoptive father of the artist Domenico Campagnola.  Life  The Astrologer, so-called Christ with the Woman of Samaria His early years are better documented than his adult life. He was born in Padua, then subject to the republic of Venice, and home to one of the three major European universities of the fifteenth century, the University of Padua. His father Girolamo was characterised by A. Hyatt Mayor as \\"a writer of some note, probably also an amateur artist, who belonged to what would now be called the intelligentsia\\";Mayor 1937:194 letters by him in very good humanist Latin survive. According to Giorgio Vasari, Girolamo was also an artist \\"a Paduan painter and disciple of Squarcione\\", but this remark is the only evidence for that. A number of sources, including Vasari, say that Campagnola was extremely accomplished in a number of artistic areas as a teenager. A letter written by a relative when he was fifteen describes him as a talented poet, singer and lutenist, able to read Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and skilled in painting, engraving and cutting gemstones. This letter was sent to the court at Mantua (where Andrea Mantegna was then the court artist) in an attempt to find him a position there. It is not clear if he ever went to Mantua, although (like nearly all contemporary Italian printmakers) his work shows the influence of Mantegna. One engraving is certainly based (perhaps not directly, as there was another print of it) on a drawing by Mantegna or his workshop.Campagnola: Saint John the Baptist, National Gallery of Art. Concert by a brook, the landscape by Giulio, the figures by Domenico Landscape with Two Men Sitting near a Coppice, pen and wash (Louvre Museum). Later begun as an engraving by Giulio, but finished by his son Domenico. Some ascribe the drawing to Giorgione. In 1499 he appears (rather briefly) in the accounts of the court at Ferrara, another centre of North Italian printmaking. There is then no documentation until 1507, when another Paduan recorded lending him a painting and three copper engraving plates. This was in Venice, where most writers assume he was living by then. His engraving of an Astrologer is dated 1509 on the plate, and the only later record comes from the will of Aldus Manutius in 1515, when Manutius asks that he be given the work of cutting the moulds for, or perhaps designing, some printing type. At the period he also became a friend of the humanist and alchemical poet Giovanni Aurelio Augurello. Depicting his experiments with artificial blue pigments in his Chrysopoeia (Venice 1515) Augurello refers to Giulio (\\"meus Iulius\\") as the one person who at least is somehow profiting from the vain quest for gold.The relationship is depicted in Dal Canton, Giuseppina: Giulio Campagnola 'pittore alchimista‚Äô (I), Antichit√† viva 16/5 (1977), pp. 11-19; part (II) ibid 17/2 (1978), pp. 3-10. After this there is no further record, but an engraving plate that he had left half-finished was completed by his adopted son c. 1517, so he is assumed to have died by then at the latest, probably in Venice. He had adopted Domenico Campagnola, apparently an orphan of German parentage, in about 1512. Another source claimed that he took holy orders, but this is now discounted. Fortunately, for those seeking to reconstruct his career, he was in the habit of signing, though not dating, his engravings, often with his full name and Antenoreus, a slightly showy learned reference to the Trojan whom Virgil designated the founder of Padua.  Professional status Most writers see Campagnola as a professional artist, who received some sort of training in Mantua, Ferrara or Venice. Vasari describes him as a painter, and the Venetian connoisseur Marcantonio Michiel mentions cabinet paintings that were ascribed to him in Venetian collections in about 1530, but no paintings are generally attributed to him, although he is often brought into arguments about the many \\"Giorgionesque\\" paintings without an agreed attribution. He is often given a share in the fresco cycle in the Scuola del Santo at Padua, attributed to his son Domenico. There are drawings related to his prints, and in a similar style to them, but only a handful of these are generally agreed to be by him, with Titian, Giorgione and in one case Mantegna also being brought into contention.Giulio Campagnola or Possibly Giorgione: Jupiter and Ganymede above an Extensive Landscape, National Gallery of Art.Giulio Campagnola: Landscape with Two Men Sitting near a Coppice , Louvre. It is still possible to see Campagnola, as W.R. Rearick did, as a \\"dilettante\\" who probably mostly lived in Padua, probably with another career altogether. This, however, remains a minority view. Most of his prints have no surviving preparatory drawings, and in general the question of whether Campagnola designed them himself or engraved then after drawings provided by other artists remains open. Most historians, however, see him as an independent artist responsible for conceiving as well as executing most of his prints, rather than a precursor of Marcantonio Raimondi or Domenico Campagnola who acted as a technical collaborator with a greater artist who supplied the designs.  Work  The dating of his work is based very largely on the stylistic arrangement of his work around the Astrologer, dated 1509, and his presumed death around 1515. Whilst the chronological sequence of his engravings set out by Arthur M. Hind has been generally accepted, the dating of them remains a subject for discussion. His early work is heavily influenced by Albrecht D√ºrer, and includes one direct copy of a D√ºrer engraving, and a few where landscape elements are copied from D√ºrer.Giulio Campagnola: the Rape of Ganymede, Metropolitan Museum of Art; the landscape is lifted verbatim from D√ºrer's Masonna with a Monkey of 1499 (Mayer 1937:\`94). He also included a portrait of D√ºrer in his Marriage of the Virgin Mary, which D√ºrer himself may have drawn. The next group of engravings, which include the Astrologer, very successfully interpret the mood of Venetian painting of the first decade of the century in the medium of engraving. It is this group that he is most famous for, and that also introduce his stipple technique. Stippling means engraving with dots or little flicks of the burin, rather than the normal lines. Campagnola is able to convey varying tone by different intensities of dots, rather than by techniques of hatching and cross-hatching usually necessary.Giulio Campagnola: Saint John the Baptist, Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts. These engravings are in a combination of line and stipple work, and in the case of three of them (see gallery: The Old Shepherd, The Young Shepherd and The Astrologer), there are first states which are purely in line-work.

Born in Belfast, Wilson became the director of a private nursing home. In 1981, he was elected to Castlereagh Borough Council for the Democratic Unionist Party, a post he held until 1989. During this time, he became known for his role in campaigning against the Anglo-Irish Agreement. At the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Wilson stood unsuccessfully in Belfast South. In 1996, he joined the UK Unionist Party (UKUP), and was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum under the top-up system in 1996. When the Forum was replaced by the Northern Ireland Assembly, Wilson won a seat in Strangford outright, initially placing third out of twenty-two candidates. In 1999, Wilson and three of the four other UKUP Assembly members left the party to form the Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP). They argued that they should not quit their Assembly seats should Sinn F√©in take up its seats in the without prior Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning of weapons. Wilson became the party leader, and in the 2001 UK general election, he contested the Strangford parliamentary seat, but came bottom of the poll, with only 1.9% of the vote. This poor showing was reflected in the 2003 Assembly election, when Wilson initially placed only tenth out of thirteen candidates, and all the NIUP members lost their seats. Wilson remained leader of the NIUP, but the party is currently inactive. Wilson stood as an independent candidate in the Strangford constituency at the 2007 Assembly election where he polled 305 votes (0.8%), thus finishing last out of the fifteen candidates.

Background He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, 24 August 1905, and was christened at a church in Twickenham, England. Young Douglas was the son of William Young Kinleyside, a businessman and lawyer. Business brought his father to New York on several occasions, and eventually, five-year old Douglas, with his sister Hazel, were brought to America as second cabin class passengers, on board the British steamer Mauritania, which sailed from the Port of Liverpool on 29 October 1910, and arrived at the Port of New York, 4 November. He became an American citizen in 1939. Adopting the stage name \\"Don Douglas\\", he became a singer and actor in musical shows such as Footlites. In 1928, his big break came when he won glowing revues for his performance in The Desert Song in the Orpheum Theatre in Chicago. This would eventually lead to his career in talking pictures. Film Douglas appeared in over 100 films from the late 1920s to the 1940s including The Great Gabbo (1929), Life Begins (1932), Men in White (1934), Madame X (1937), Cheers for Miss Bishop (1941), Now, Voyager (1942), Little Tokyo, U.S.A. (1942), Tall in the Saddle (1944), Murder, My Sweet (1944) and Show Business (1944). One of his more prominent roles was also one of his last: In Gilda (1946), he plays the man who pretends to marry Rita Hayworth but is really a henchman of Glenn Ford's character. Radio Douglas was a one-man cast on The Black Castle. He played all roles in each episode and was the announcer. A review of The Black Castle in the trade publication Billboard complimented Douglas's handling of multiple roles in the drama. Bob Francis wrote: \\"Except for the fact that he is inclined to ham the wizard, making the role often seem more silly than awesome, Douglas puts on a good 15 minutes. His vocal changes are sharp and clear, and his characterizations come over effectively.\\" He also had the title role in John Steele, AdventurerTerrace, Vincent (1999). Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 177-178. and played Chief Jake Workley in Scattergood Baines. He was also a member of the cast of Kelly's Courthouse. Death Douglas died on 31 December 1945 in Los Angeles, California, aged 40, after emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

He died in New York City at the age of 101. Lineage, education and early years Yehuda Dovid Eizensztejn, as he was named at birth, was the second of two children born to Rabbi Zeev Wolf and Toba Bluma (n√©e Barg). His sister, Henna, was a year-and-a-half older. When he was ten years old his father became the first Jew from Mezritch to emigrate to the United States. As a child, therefore, his education in Talmud was left to his paternal grandfather, Azriel Zelig, the son of Noson Neta Eizensztejn, a Talmudic scholar and dyer of indigo originally from the village of Stawiska (in Yiddish, Stavisk). His antecedents had moved there from K√∂nigsberg, and claimed to be direct descendants of Rashi. In 1872, Toba Bluma emigrated to the United States with her son and daughter and joined Zeev Wolf in New York. It was there that Yehuda Dovid anglicized his first name to Julius and adopted the American spelling of his family name. He married the following year. Eisenstein's parents eventually divorced, after which his father made aliyah to Jerusalem, where he remarried and raised a second family. Both Zeev Wolf and Toiba Bluma's family were proto-Zionists. Her maternal grandfather, Rabbi Tzvi Zeev (in Yiddish, Hirsch Wolf) Fiszbejn, had already moved to Jerusalem with his two sons, Abraham and Isaac, and other descendants in 1863. Tzvi Zeev was a wealthy brush manufacturer in Mezritch and financed the construction of the original Etz Chaim Yeshiva in the Old City.url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10816-miedzyrzecz They and Zeev Wolf are all buried in close proximity in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery. Hebraist and historian Eisenstein was a lover of Hebrew, and established America's first society for the Hebrew language, Shoharei Sfat Ever. He was also the first to translate the Constitution of the United States into Hebrew and Yiddish (New York, 1891). Other early writings of his are Ma'amarei BaMasoret, ib. 1897, and The Classified Psalter (Pesukei dezimra), Hebrew text with a new translation (1899). He also made an attempt to translate and explain a modified text of the Shulchan Aruch. In HaModi'a laHadashim (New York) for 1901, he published, under the title LeDorot Golei Russiya b'America, a sketch of the history of Russo-Jewish emigration to America. His History of the First Russo-American Jewish Congregation appeared in No. 9 of the Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society, in 1901. Primary works Eisenstein was a scholar of extraordinarily broad learning. He contributed more than 150 entries to the 1901‚Äì1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, from which much of the above biography was based, and he authored thousands of articles in newspapers, journals, encyclopedias, and anthologies. His memories are contained in a 1929 volume called Otzar Zikhronotai (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ñ◊ô◊õ◊®◊ï◊†◊ï◊™◊ô). Other works, most of which can be downloaded at HebrewBooks.org are as follows: * Otzar Perushim we-Ziyurim (1920) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊§◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊¶◊ô◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊î◊í◊ì◊î ◊©◊ú ◊§◊°◊ó), an illustrated Passover haggadah * Otzar Dinim u-Minhagim (1917) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ì◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊û◊†◊î◊í◊ô◊ù), a digest of Jewish laws (halakha) and customs (minhagim) * Otzar D'rushim Nibharim (1918) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ì◊®◊ï◊©◊ô◊ù ◊†◊ë◊ó◊®◊ô◊ù), an anthology of midrashic literature * Otzar Maamare Hazal (1922) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊û◊ê◊û◊®◊ô ◊ó◊ñ\\"◊ú), a concordance of rabbinical quotations, sayings and phrases * Otzar Ma'amare Tanakh (1925) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊û◊ê◊û◊®◊ô ◊î◊™◊†\\"◊ö), a concordance of words, phrases and idioms in the Tanakh * Otzar Masa'oth (1927) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™), an anthology of itineraries by Jewish travelers to Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and other countries * Otzar Midrashim (1915) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊û◊ì◊®◊©◊ô◊ù), \\"Anthology of Midrashim,\\" a library of 200 minor midrashim * Otzar Vikukhim (1922) (◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ï◊ô◊õ◊ï◊ó◊ô◊ù), \\"Anthology of Debates,\\" a collection of polemics and disputations with Christianity * Otzar Yisrael (principal editor, 1906‚Äì1913, 10 volumes) (◊ê◊†◊¶◊ô◊ß◊ú◊ï◊§◊ì◊ô◊î ◊ê◊ï◊¶◊® ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú), which has the distinction of being the first comprehensive (i.e., not restricted exclusively to Jewish topics) encyclopedia in the Hebrew language. Eisenstein undertook this work in response to perceived limitations of the English-language Jewish Encyclopedia. For obvious reasons, he was known by many colleagues as the Ba'al ha-Otzrot (\\"Master of the Anthologies\\"). His works remain standard reference books in yeshivot, batei midrash, synagogues, and Jewish libraries to this day. Philanthropist and polemicist Eisenstein first visited the Land of Israel in 1899 via Egypt, where he met with local Jewish communities in Alexandria and Cairo. After arriving in Jaffa, he toured fledgling Zionist villages, including Rishon LeZion, Rehovot and Petah Tikva, and reunited with his father in Jerusalem. Among other consumables, he brought with him ten-thousand liters of American flour, which he sold without profit, half in Jaffa and half in Jerusalem. This marked the first time American flour was imported into the country. Until then, higher-cost Russian flour was imported via Odessa, and its price often placed it beyond the reach of many poor people. In 1926, Eisenstein sailed a second time to the Land of Israel via Europe, docking in Haifa. He visited Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva, as well as the holy cities of Hebron, Tiberias, Safed, and Jerusalem, where he paid his respects at the graves of his father, great-grandfather and great-uncles. During his stay he met with a significant number of rabbis representing every spectrum of Orthodoxy, from Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine, to Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, co-founder of the Edah HaChareidis. Back in America, Eisenstein took a prominent part in the controversy concerning the Kolel America, a society for the collection of funds for the poor Jews of Palestine, and was one of the leaders in the movement to arrange that the money contributed in the United States should go primarily to former residents of America. His political views were marked by hostility toward Reform and Conservative Judaism. Though Eisenstein became widely read as a writer, he was less successful as a businessman and lost much of his fortune in a failed effort to establish an agricultural colony for Jewish immigrants in New Jersey. Family Eisenstein and his wife, Rebecca (n√©e Cohen), were the parents of nine children: Isaac (1875-1961), Nathan (1878-1952), Miriam (1882-1969), Lilly (1885-1916), Selig (1886-1978), Birdie (1888-1984), Rose (1891-1984), and Benedict (1894-1983). The ninth, a daughter, Hattie, died from diphtheria at the age of three. His grandson, Ira Eisenstein, who did not inherit his grandfather's outlook, was ordained a Conservative rabbi and is considered one of the founders of Reconstructionist Judaism. Eisenstein was also a second cousin of American champion bridge player Harry Fishbein. Popular kosher cookbook author Susie Fishbein is married to a second cousin thrice-removed.

Plot In a packed courtroom, Butch Long (Walter Long) vows revenge on 'squealers' Laurel and Hardy whose evidence has helped to send him to prison for the rest of his life, threatening to \\"break off their legs and wrap 'em around their necks!\\" after Laurel makes a suggestion to the judge (Harry Dunkinson), \\"Aren't you going to hang him?\\" Later, in the car, Ollie repeats this question sarcastically, since he saw Long's reaction just after Stan said it; he then asks Stan, \\"Couldn't you see that he was annoyed?\\" (an understatement to be sure!) The clearly frightened boys make plans to move far away and advertise for someone to go with them and share the travel expenses. The person involved is actually Butch's girlfriend (Mae Busch). Butch soon manages to escape by leaping from a train, and makes his way to his girlfriend's apartment, where Stan and Ollie ring the bell. Butch hides in a large trunk, thinking it's the cops at the door; the trunk gets locked and Butch can't get out. The boys do their best to get him out, not realizing who the trapped person really is. After several inept attempts at freeing him, Butch notices (and recognizes) Ollie through a bored hole. His suggestion of using a blowtorch to melt the lock off backfires as Butch is set on fire. The boys hose Butch down and he frees himself from the trunk, taking his promised revenge on them as the cops arrive shortly afterwards. The film ends with Stan and Ollie sitting on the couch, both with their legs snapped off and tied around their necks. Then Ollie says his \\"another nice mess‚Ä¶\\" catchphrase to Stan, who whimpers \\"Well I couldn't help it...\\".

In 1994, WAM was the only investment manager to testify before the President's Glass Ceiling Commission, encouraging the full corporate disclosure of diversity information. In 2004, WAM and its parent company, Boston Trust and Investment Management, became fully employee-owned. Socially Responsible Investment Strategies WAM primarily encourages corporate responsibility and responsiveness through its share holdings. WAM also utilizes other forms of shareholder activism such as screening portfolios for companies that don't meet SRI standards, communicating directly with companies about relevant issues, introducing and voting on shareholder resolutions, and engaging in community development investing. WAM is a leading sponsor of the \\"say on pay\\" concept, under which a company's stockholders would have an approval right over the remuneration of the company's executives.Claudia H.

She had an enormous success with samba songs written by composers such as Nelson Cavaquinho, Paulinho da Viola and Chico Buarque, in addition to songs devoted to orishas and Portela, her favorite samba school. Among her hits, recorded in 16 solo albums, are \\"Voc√™ passa, eu acho gra√ßa\\" (1968), \\"√ä baiana\\" (1971), \\"Conto de areia\\" (1974), \\"O mar serenou\\" (1975), \\"Cora√ß√£o leviano\\" (1977), \\"Na linha do mar\\" (1979), \\"Morena de Angola\\" (1980), and \\"Na√ß√£o\\" (1982). At the peak of her career, Nunes would sell more than a million copies of each album she released. Nunes was also a researcher of the rhythms and folklore of Brazilian popular music, and traveled several times to Africa to search for the roots of black music. Familiar to Afro-Brazilian dances and traditions, she converted to Candombl√© in her later life. On April 2, 1983, she died at age 40 after suffering from anaphylaxis during a surgery to treat varicose veins. Even today she remains one of the most popular singers in Brazil. Biography =Early life= Clara Francisca Gon√ßalves was born on August 12, 1942, in Cedro, Paraopeba, Minas Gerais, where she lived until the age of 16.All Brazilian Music She was the youngest child of Manuel Pereira de Ara√∫jo, and Am√©lia Gon√ßalves Nunes. Her father was a joiner in the Cedro & Cachoeira textile mill, and was known in the town as Man√© Serrador. He was also a violeiro and a participant in the local Festival of the Three Kings. Manuel died on 1944, and soon after, the young Clara would also lose her mother. Orphaned, she would be raised by her older sister Dindinha (Maria Gon√ßalves) and brother Jos√© (known as Z√© Chilau). At that time, Clara attended catechism classes in the Church of the Eucharistic Crusade. There, she also sang litanies in Latin in the church choir. According to her own words, she grew up listening to Carmen Costa, √Çngela Maria, and especially Elizeth Cardoso and Dalva de Oliveira, the latter which had always been a big influence on her music, even though she kept a unique style. On 1952, as a young girl, Clara won her first singing contest, held in her hometown, performing \\"Recuerdos de Ypacara√≠\\". As a prize, she won a blue dress. At age 14, Clara became a weaver in the Cedro & Cachoeira factory, the same in which her father had also been an employee. At age 16, she moved to Belo Horizonte after her brother Z√© Chilau killed her boyfriend in 1957. In the state capital, Clara lived with her sister Vicentina and her brother Joaquim. There, she worked as a weaver by day and attended school by night. On weekends, Clara participated in the rehearsals of the Renaissance Choir, at the church in the neighborhood where she lived. At that time, she met guitar player Jadir Ambr√≥sio, known for having composed the anthem of Cruzeiro. Admired by her voice, he took Clara to sing in several local radio programs, such as Degraus da Fama, in which she performed under the name of Clara Francisca. =Name change and early success= In the early 1960s, Clara also met Aurino Ara√∫jo (brother of Eduardo Ara√∫jo), who introduced her to many artists. Aurino would also be her boyfriend for ten years. The record producer Cid Carvalho persuaded her to change her stage name to Clara Nunes, using her mother's maiden name. She would change her name once again, becoming Clara Francisca Gon√ßalves Pinheiro after her marriage. In 1960, still working as a weaver, she won the Minas Gerais stage of a contest named \\"The Golden Voice of ABC\\", performing \\"Serenata do Adeus\\", composed by Vin√≠cius de Moraes and previously recorded by Elizeth Cardoso. In the national stage of the competition, held in S√£o Paulo, she won the third place with the song \\"S√≥ Adeus\\" (composed by Jair Amorim and Evaldo Gouveia). Thereafter, Clara Nunes began singing at R√°dio Inconfid√™ncia in Belo Horizonte. For three consecutive years she was named the best radio singer of Minas Gerais. She also began to perform as a crooner in nightclubs and bars in the state capital, later working with then bassist Milton Nascimento, then known as Bituca. At that time, she made her first appearance on television, performing on Hebe Camargo's show in Belo Horizonte. In 1963, Clara Nunes got her own TV show on Belo Horizonte's Itacolomi channel, titled Clara Nunes Presents. In the program, which aired for a year and a half, she received famous artists such as Altemar Dutra and √Çngela Maria as guests. Following the end of her TV show, in 1965, Clara moved to the Copacabana neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro to pursue a national career as singer. =First recordings= After a few LPs featuring assorted styles, she became a samba vocalist in the 1970s and became well known. In 1974, Clara had a hit with the samba \\"Conto de Areia\\" and her album sold approximately 300,000 copies. It was a remarkable achievement which helped to overturn the idea that women were unable to become big record sellers (in Brazil) and thereby stimulated other companies to invest in other female samba musicians, such as Alcione and Beth Carvalho. In 1975, she toured Europe. The following albums transformed her into one of the \\"three samba queens\\" of her time, along with the two above- mentioned musicians. In the second half of the decade, she released one album every year, all of them selling well and featuring historic tracks such as \\"Ju√≠zo Final\\", \\"Cora√ß√£o Leviano\\" and \\"Morena de Angola\\". Other hits were \\"Voc√™ Passa e Eu Acho Gra√ßa\\", \\"√ä Baiana\\", \\"Ilu Ay√™ - Terra da Vida\\", \\"Tristeza, P√© no Ch√£o\\", \\"A Deusa dos Orix√°s\\", \\"Macuna√≠ma\\", \\"O Mar Serenou\\", \\"As For√ßas da Natureza\\", \\"Guerreira\\", \\"Feira de Mangaio\\", \\"Portela na Avenida\\" and \\"Na√ß√£o\\". Clara was also famous for songs crafted from the rhythms of Umbanda, her Afro- Brazilian religion, and for her typical costumes, as she always dressed in white and wore many necklaces and African beads. =Death= On March 5, 1983, Clara Nunes underwent a seemingly simple surgery to treat varicose veins, but ended up having an allergic reaction to one of the components of the anesthetic. Clara suffered a cardiac arrest and remained hospitalized for 28 days in Cl√≠nica S√£o Vicente's Intensive Care Unit. Meanwhile, the singer was the victim of a series of speculations that circulated in the media over her hospital admission, including \\"artificial insemination, abortion, suicide attempt, and spousal abuse by her husband\\". A similar episode occurred after the death of her friend, singer Elis Regina, in the previous year. In the morning of April 2, 1983 ‚Äì a Holy Saturday ‚Äì Clara Nunes was officially declared dead, at the age of 40, victim of an anaphylactic shock.

The inquiry opened by the Regional Medical Council of Rio de Janeiro to investigate whether there was medical negligence in the case was filed, which would increase speculation about her cause of death. The singer's funeral was attended by more than 50,000 people in the court of the . Her burial at Cemit√©rio S√£o Jo√£o Batista was accompanied by a crowd of fans and friends. In her honor, the street in Oswaldo Cruz where Portela is located was named after her.

In November 1998, Litvinenko and several other FSB officers publicly accused their superiors of ordering the assassination of the Russian tycoon and oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Litvinenko was arrested the following March on charges of exceeding the authority of his position. He was acquitted in November 1999 but re-arrested before the charges were again dismissed in 2000. He fled with his family to London and was granted asylum in the United Kingdom, where he worked as a journalist, writer and consultant for the British intelligence services. During his time in Boston, Lincolnshire, Litvinenko wrote two books, Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within and Lubyanka Criminal Group, wherein he accused the Russian secret services of staging the Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in an effort to bring Vladimir Putin to power. He also accused Putin of ordering the murder in October 2006 of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalised in what was established as a case of poisoning by radioactive polonium-210; he died from the poisoning on 23 November. He became the first known victim of lethal polonium 210-induced acute radiation syndrome.Guinness World Records: First murder by radiation: On 23 November 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Litvinenko, a retired member of the Russian security services (FSB), died from radiation poisoning in London, UK, becoming the first known victim of lethal Polonium 210-induced acute radiation syndrome. The events leading up to this are a matter of controversy, spawning numerous theories relating to his poisoning and death. A British murder investigation pointed to Andrey Lugovoy, a former member of Russia's Federal Protective Service, as the prime suspect. The United Kingdom demanded that Lugovoy be extradited, which is against the Constitution of Russia, which prohibitsChapter 2.

Russia denied the extradition, which led to the straining of relations between Russia and the United Kingdom. After Litvinenko's death, Marina Litvinenko, aided by biologist Alexander Goldfarb, pursued a vigorous campaign through the Litvinenko Justice Foundation. In October 2011, she won the right for an inquest into her husband's death to be conducted by a coroner in London; the inquest was repeatedly set back by issues relating to examinable evidence. A public inquiry began on 27 January 2015, and concluded in January 2016 that Litvinenko's murder was an FSB operation that was probably personally approved by both Vladimir Putin and Nikolai Patrushev who was then Director of FSB.The Litvinenko Inquiry. Report into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, January 2016, p. 241-244. Early life and career Alexander Litvinenko was born in the Russian city of Voronezh in 1962.( at WebCite) After he graduated from a Nalchik secondary school in 1980, he was drafted into the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a Private. After a year of service, he matriculated in the Kirov Higher Command School in Vladikavkaz. In 1981, Litvinenko married Nataliya, an accountant, with whom he had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sonia. This marriage ended in divorce in 1994 and in the same year Litvinenko married Marina, a ballroom dancer and fitness instructor, with whom he had a son, Anatoly.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After graduation in 1985, Litvinenko became a platoon commander in the Dzerzhinsky Division of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was assigned to the 4th Company of 4th Regiment, where among his duties was the protection of valuable cargo while in transit.(Archived at WebCite) In 1986, he became an informant when he was recruited by the MVD's KGB counterintelligence section and in 1988, he was officially transferred to the Third Chief Directorate of the KGB, Military Counter Intelligence. Later that year, after studying for a year at the Novosibirsk Military Counter Intelligence School, he became an operational officer and served in KGB military counterintelligence until 1991. Career in Russian security services In 1991, Litvinenko was promoted to the Central Staff of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, specialising in counter-terrorist activities and infiltration of organised crime. He was awarded the title of \\"MUR veteran\\" for operations conducted with the Moscow criminal investigation department, the MUR. Litvinenko also saw active military service in many of the so-called \\"hot spots\\" of the former USSR and Russia.\\"In Memoriam Aleksander Litvinenko.\\" Dir. Jose De Putter. VPRO Backlight, 2007. Documentary. During the First Chechen War, Litvinenko planted several FSB agents in Chechnya. Although he was often called a \\"Russian spy\\" by western press, throughout his career he was not an 'intelligence agent' and did not deal with secrets beyond information on operations against organised criminal groups. () Litvinenko met Boris Berezovsky in 1994 when he took part in investigations into an assassination attempt on the oligarch. He later was responsible for the oligarch's security. Litvinenko's employment under Berezovsky and other security services created a conflict of interest, but such practice is usually tolerated by the Russian state. In 1997, Litvinenko was promoted to the FSB Directorate of Analysis and Suppression of Criminal Groups, with the title of senior operational officer and deputy head of the Seventh Section. ( at WebCite)( at WebCite) Conflict with FSB leadership During his work in the FSB, Litvinenko discovered numerous connections between top brass of Russian law enforcement agencies and Russian mafia groups, such as the Solntsevo gang. He wrote a memorandum about this issue for Boris Yeltsin. Berezovsky arranged a meeting for him with FSB director Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Director of Internal affairs Ovchinnikov to discuss the corruption problems;Death of a dissident, page 39-41. however, this had no effect. Litvinenko gradually realized that the entire system was corrupted from the top to the bottom. He explained: \\"If your partner bilked you, or a creditor did not pay, or a supplier did not deliver - where did you turn to complain? ...When force became a commodity, there was always demand for it. \\"Roofs\\" appeared, people who sheltered and protected your business. First it was provided by the mob, then by police, and soon even our own guys realized what was what, and then the rivalry began among gangsters, cops, and the Agency for market share. As the police and the FSB became more competitive, they squeezed the gangs out of the market. However, in many cases competition gave way to cooperation, and the services became gangsters themselves.\\" According to US diplomats, Litvinenko coined the phrase \\"Mafia state\\". On 25 July 1998, Berezovsky introduced Litvinenko to Vladimir Putin. He said: \\"Go see Putin. Make yourself known. See what a great guy we have installed, with your help.\\"Death of a Dissident, page 136 On the same day, Putin replaced Nikolay Kovalyov as the Director of the Federal Security Service, with help from Berezovsky. Litvinenko reported to Putin on corruption in the FSB, but Putin was unimpressed. Litvinenko said to his wife after the meeting: \\"I could see in his eyes that he hated me.\\" Litvinenko said that he was doing an investigation of Uzbek drug barons who received protection from the FSB, and Putin tried to stall the investigation to save his reputation.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/27/russia.nickpatonwalsh On 13 November 1998, Berezovsky wrote an open letter to Putin in Kommersant. He accused senior officers of the Directorate of Analysis and Suppression of Criminal Groups Major-General Yevgeny Khokholkov, N. Stepanov, A. Kamyshnikov, and N. Yenin of ordering his assassination. Four days later, on 17 November, Litvinenko and four other officers appeared together in a press conference at the Russian news agency Interfax. All officers worked for both FSB in the Directorate of Analysis and Suppression of Criminal Groups. They repeated the allegation made by Berezovsky. The officers also said they were ordered to kill Mikhail Trepashkin who was also present at the press conference, and to kidnap a brother of the businessman Umar Dzhabrailov. In 2007, Sergey Dorenko provided the Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal with a complete copy of an interview he conducted in April 1998 for ORT, a television station, with Litvinenko and his fellow employees. The interview, of which only excerpts were broadcast in 1998, shows the FSB officers, who were disguised in masks or dark glasses, claim that their bosses had ordered them to kill, kidnap or frame prominent Russian politicians and business people. After holding the press conference, Litvinenko was dismissed from the FSB. Later, in an interview with Yelena Tregubova, Putin said that he personally ordered the dismissal of Litvinenko, stating, \\"I fired Litvinenko and disbanded his unit ...because FSB officers should not stage press conferences. This is not their job. And they should not make internal scandals public.\\"Alex Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko. Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB, The Free Press (2007) Litvinenko also believed that Putin was behind his arrest. He said, \\"Putin had the power to decide whether to pass my file to the prosecutors or not. He always hated me. And there was a bonus for him: by throwing me to the wolves he distanced himself from Boris [Berezovsky] in the eyes of FSB's generals.\\"Death of a Dissident, p. 160. Flight from Russia and asylum in the United Kingdom In October 2000, in violation of an order not to leave Moscow, Litvinenko and his family travelled to Turkey, possibly via Ukraine. (Archived at WebCite) While in Turkey, Litvinenko applied for asylum at the United States Embassy in Ankara, but his application was denied. With the help of Alexander Goldfarb, Litvinenko bought air tickets for the Istanbul-London-Moscow flight, ( at WebCite) and asked for political asylum at Heathrow Airport during the transit stop on 1 November 2000. ( at WebCite) Political asylum was granted on 14 May 2001, not because of his knowledge on intelligence matters, according to Litvinenko, but rather on humanitarian grounds. While in London he became a journalist for Chechenpress and an author. He also joined Berezovsky in campaigning against Putin's government. In October 2006, he became a naturalised British citizen with residence in Whitehaven. In 2002, Litvinenko was convicted in absentia in Russia and given a three-and-a-half-year jail sentence for charges of corruption.Alexander Litvinenko The Guardian Retrieved on 5 April 2008 According to Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, her husband cooperated with the British security services, working as a consultant and helping the agencies to combat Russian organised crime in Europe.Litvinenko worked for UK intelligence ‚Äì News ‚Äì Politics ‚Äì The Voice of Russia: News, Breaking news, Politics, Economics, Business, Russia, International current events, Expert opinion, podcasts, Video . : (17 October 2011). Retrieved on 12 August 2013. During the public inquiry started in January 2015, it was confirmed that Litvinenko was recruited by MI6 to provide \\"useful information about senior Kremlin figures and their links with Russian organised crime\\", primarily related to Russian mafia activities in Spain. Shortly before his death, Litvinenko tipped off Spanish authorities on several organised crime bosses with links to Spain. During a meeting in May 2006 he allegedly provided security officials with information on the locations, roles, and activities of several \\"Russian\\" mafia figures with ties to Spain, including Zahkar Kalashov, Izguilov and Tariel Oniani. Litvinenko converted to Islam in Britain. Visitors to Litvinenko's deathbed included Boris Berezovsky and Litvinenko's father, Walter, who flew in from Moscow. Litvinenko told his father he had converted to Islam. Mrs Litvinenko said his father commented about it: \\"It doesn't matter. At least you're not a communist.\\" Mikhail Trepashkin said that in 2002 he had warned Litvinenko that an FSB unit was assigned to assassinate him. In spite of this, Litvinenko often travelled overseas with no security arrangements, and freely mingled with the Russian community in the United Kingdom, and often received journalists at his home. Allegations Litvinenko published a number of allegations about the Russian government, most of which are related to conducting or sponsoring domestic and foreign terrorism. =Support of terrorism worldwide by the KGB and FSB= Litvinenko stated that \\"all the bloodiest terrorists of the world\\" were connected to FSB-KGB, including Carlos \\"The Jackal\\" Ram√≠rez, Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Abdullah √ñcalan, Wadie Haddad of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, George Hawi who led the Communist Party of Lebanon, Ezekias Papaioannou from Cyprus, Sean Garland from Ireland, and many others. He said that all of them were trained, funded, and provided with weapons, explosives and counterfeit documents to carry out terrorist attacks worldwide and that each act of terrorism made by these people was carried out according to the task and under the rigid control of the KGB of the USSR.The originator of the acts of terrorism in London was standing near Tony Blair Retrieved on 3 April 2008 Litvinenko said that \\"the center of global terrorism is not in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan or the Chechen Republic. The terrorism infection creeps away worldwide from the cabinets of the Lubyanka Square and the Kremlin\\". When asked in an interview who he thought the originator of the 2005 bombings in London was, Litvinenko responded saying, \\"You know, I have spoken about it earlier and I shall say now, that I know only one organization, which has made terrorism the main tool of solving of political problems. It is the Russian special services.\\" Litvinenko also commented on a new law that \\"Russia has the right to carry out preemptive strikes on militant bases abroad\\" and explained that these \\"preemptive strikes may involve anything except nuclear weapons.\\" Litvinenko said, \\"You know who they mean when they say 'terrorist bases abroad'? They mean us, Zakayev and Boris and me.\\" He also said that \\"It was considered in our service that poison is an easier weapon than a pistol.\\" He referred to a secret laboratory in Moscow that still continues development of deadly poisons, according to him.Litvinenko's Poisoning: Detailed Unfolding of Events =Armenian parliament shooting= Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General-Staff of the Russian armed forces of having organised the 1999 Armenian parliament shooting that killed the Prime Minister of Armenia, Vazgen Sargsyan, and seven members of parliament, ostensibly to derail the peace process which would have resolved the Nagorno- Karabakh conflict, but he offered no evidence to support the accusation. ( at WebCite) ( at Freezepage.com) The Russian embassy in Armenia denied any such involvement, and described Litvinenko's accusation as an attempt to harm relations between Armenia and Russia by people against the democratic reforms in Russia. =Russian apartment bombings= Litvinenko wrote two books, Lubyanka Criminal Group and Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within (in co- authorship with historian Yuri Felshtinsky), where he accused the Russian secret services of staging the Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in an effort to bring Vladimir Putin to power. ( at WebCite) =Moscow theatre hostage crisis= In a 2003 interview with the Australian SBS TV network, and aired on Dateline, Litvinenko claimed that two of the Chechen terrorists involved in the 2002 Moscow theatre siege‚Äîwhom he named \\"Abdul the Bloody\\" and \\"Abu Bakar\\"‚Äîwere working for the FSB, and that the agency manipulated the rebels into staging the attack. Litvinenko said, \\"[W]hen they tried to find [Abdul the Bloody and Abu Bakar] among the dead terrorists, they weren't there. The FSB got its agents out. So the FSB agents among Chechens organized the whole thing on FSB orders, and those agents were released.\\" This echoed similar claims made by Mikhail Trepashkin. The leading role of an FSB agent, Khanpasha Terkibaev (\\"Abu Bakar\\"), was also described by Anna Politkovskaya, Ivan Rybkin and Alexander Khinshtein.Russian Authorities Hedge Over Special Services Involvement In Moscow Theater Siege , by Anna Politkovskaya, Novaya Gazeta, 5 May 2003 In the beginning of April 2003, Litvinenko gave \\"the Terkibaev file\\" to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London, who in turn passed it to Anna Politkovskaya. A few days later Yushenkov was assassinated. Terkibaev was later killed in Chechnya. According to Ivan Rybkin, a speaker of the Russian State Duma, \\"The authorities failed to keep [the FSB agent] Terkibaev out of public view, and that is why he was killed. I know how angry people were, because they knew Terkibaev had authorization from presidential administration.\\"Anna Politkovskaya A Russian Diary: A Journalist's Final Account of Life, Corruption, and Death in Putin's Russia, Random House, New York, 2007, , page 56. =Beslan school siege= In September 2004, Alexander Litvinenko suggested that the Russian secret services must have been aware of the plot beforehand and probably had organised the attack themselves in order to toughen laws on terrorism and expand the powers of law enforcement agencies. His conclusion was based on the fact that several Beslan hostage takers had been released from FSB custody just before the attack in Beslan. He said that they would have been freed only if they were of use to the FSB, and that even in the case that they were freed without being turned into FSB assets, they would be under strict surveillance that would not have allowed them to carry out the Beslan attack unnoticed.A. Litvinenko: \\"The identities of the terrorists prove 100% the participation of the FSB in the seizure of the school in Beslan\\", Chechenpress, 8 September 2004 Ella Kesayeva, co-chair of the group Voice of Beslan, supported Litvinenko's argument in a November 2008 article in Novaya Gazeta, noting the large number of hostage takers who were in government custody not long before attacking the school, and coming to the same conclusion. ( at WebCite) =Alleged Russia‚Äìal-Qaeda connection= In a July 2005 interview with the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, Litvinenko alleged that Ayman al-Zawahiri, a prominent leader of al-Qaeda, was trained for half a year by the FSB in Dagestan in 1997. Litvinenko said that after this training, al-Zawahiri \\"was transferred to Afghanistan, where he had never been before and where, following the recommendation of his Lubyanka chiefs, he at once ... penetrated the milieu of Osama bin Laden and soon became his assistant in Al Qaeda.\\" Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy, a former KGB officer and writer, supported this claim and said that Litvinenko \\"was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri's arrival in Russia; he was trained by FSB instructors in Dagestan, Northern Caucasus, in 1996‚Äì1997.\\"Russia and Islam are not Separate: Why Russia backs Al-Qaeda , by Konstantin Preobrazhensky. He said: \\"At that time, Litvinenko was the Head of the Subdivision for Internationally Wanted Terrorists of the First Department of the Operative-Inquiry Directorate of the FSB Anti-Terrorist Department. He was ordered to undertake the delicate mission of securing Al-Zawahiri from unintentional disclosure by the Russian police. Though Al-Zawahiri had been brought to Russia by the FSB using a false passport, it was still possible for the police to learn about his arrival and report to Moscow for verification. Such a process could disclose Al-Zawahiri as an FSB collaborator. In order to prevent this, Litvinenko visited a group of highly placed police officers to notify them in advance.\\" According to Sergei Ignatchenko, an FSB spokesman, al-Zawahiri was arrested by Russian authorities in Dagestan in December 1996 and released in May 1997. =Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya= Two weeks before his poisoning, Alexander Litvinenko accused Vladimir Putin of ordering the assassination of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya and stated that a former presidential candidate, Irina Hakamada, warned Politkovskaya about threats to her life coming from the Russian president. Litvinenko advised Politkovskaya to escape from Russia immediately. Hakamada denied her involvement in passing any specific threats, and said that she warned Politkovskaya only in general terms more than a year earlier. It remains unclear if Litvinenko referred to an earlier statement made by Boris Berezovsky, who claimed that Boris Nemtsov, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, received word from Hakamada that Putin threatened her and like-minded colleagues in person. According to Berezovsky, Putin stated that Hakamada and her colleagues \\"will take in the head immediately, literally, not figuratively\\" if they \\"open the mouth\\" about the Russian apartment bombings.Live interview with Berezovsky by Evgenia Albats, Radio Echo of Moscow, 11 June 2006. Transcript in Russian, computer translation. =Allegations concerning Romano Prodi= According to Litvinenko, the FSB deputy chief General Anatoly Trofimov said to him, \\"Don't go to Italy, there are many KGB agents among the politicians. Romano Prodi is our man there,\\" meaning Romano Prodi, the Italian centre-left leader, former Prime Minister of Italy and former President of the European Commission. The conversation with Trofimov took place in 2000, after the Prodi-KGB scandal broke out in October 1999 due to information about Prodi provided by Vasili Mitrokhin.Death of a Dissident, page 342 In April 2006, a British Member of the European Parliament for London, Gerard Batten of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), demanded an inquiry into the allegations. According to the Brussels-based newspaper The EU Reporter on 3 April 2006, \\"Another high-level source, a former KGB operative in London, has confirmed the story.\\" On 26 April 2006, Batten repeated his call for a parliamentary inquiry, revealing that \\"former senior members of the KGB are willing to testify in such an investigation, under the right conditions.\\" He added, \\"It is not acceptable that this situation is unresolved, given the importance of Russia's relations with the European Union.\\" On 22 January 2007, the BBC and ITV News released documents and video footage from February 2006, in which Litvinenko repeated his statements about Prodi. =Connections between FSB and mafia= In his book Gang from Lubyanka, Litvinenko alleged that Vladimir Putin during his time at the FSB was personally involved in protecting the drug trafficking from Afghanistan organised by Abdul Rashid Dostum. In December 2003, Russian authorities confiscated over 4,000 copies of the book. Shortly before his death, Alexander Litvinenko alleged that Vladimir Putin had cultivated a \\"good relationship\\" with Semion Mogilevich (head of the Russia mafia) since 1993 or 1994.Listen: Alexander Litvinenko's apparent warning before his death By Lyndsey Telford, Edward Malnick and Claire Newell, Telegraph, 23 January 2015 =Others= In an article written by Litvinenko in July 2006, and published online on Zakayev's Chechenpress website, he claimed that Vladimir Putin is a paedophile. Litvinenko also claimed that Anatoly Trofimov and Artyom Borovik knew of the alleged paedophilia. Litvinenko made the allegation after Putin kissed a boy on his stomach while stopping to chat with some tourists during a walk in the Kremlin grounds on 28 June 2006. The incident was recalled in a webcast organised by the BBC and Yandex, in which over 11,000 people asked Putin to explain the act, to which he responded, \\"He seemed very independent and serious... I wanted to cuddle him like a kitten and it came out in this gesture. He seemed so nice. ... There is nothing behind it.\\" According to Litvinenko, the 2005 controversy over the publication in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten of editorial cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad was orchestrated by the FSB to punish Denmark for its refusal to extradite Chechen separatists. ( at WebCite) Poisoning and death A bald Litvinenko at University College Hospital On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill. On 3 November, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital in London. He was then moved to University College Hospital for intensive care. His illness was later attributed to poisoning with radionuclide polonium-210 after the Health Protection Agency found significant amounts of the rare and highly toxic element in his body. Litvinenko met with two former agents early on the day he fell ill ‚Äì Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy. Though both denied any wrongdoing, a leaked US diplomatic cable revealed that Kovtun had left polonium traces in the house and car he had used in Hamburg. The men also introduced Litvinenko to a tall, thin man of central Asian appearance called 'Vladislav Sokolenko' who Lugovoy said was a business partner. Lugovoy is also a former bodyguard of Russian ex-Acting Prime minister Yegor Gaidar (who also suffered from a mysterious illness in November 2006). Later, Litvinenko had lunch at Itsu, a sushi restaurant in Piccadilly in London, with an Italian acquaintance and nuclear waste expert, Mario Scaramella, to whom he made the allegations regarding Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi. Scaramella, attached to the Mitrokhin Commission investigating KGB penetration of Italian politics, claimed to have information on the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya, 48, a journalist who was killed at her Moscow apartment building in October 2006. Marina Litvinenko, his widow, accused Moscow of orchestrating the murder. Though she believes the order did not come from Putin himself, she does believe it was done at the behest of the authorities, and announced that she will refuse to provide evidence to any Russian investigation out of fear that it would be misused or misrepresented. In a court hearing in London in 2015, a Scotland Yard lawyer concluded that \\"the evidence suggests that the only credible explanation is in one way or another the Russian state is involved in Litvinenko's murder\\". =Death and last statement= Before his death, Litvinenko said: \\"You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world, Mr. Putin, will reverberate in your ears for the rest of your life.\\" On 22 November 2006, Litvinenko's medical staff at University College Hospital reported Litvinenko had suffered a \\"major setback\\" due to either heart failure or an overnight heart attack. He died on 23 November. The following day, Putin publicly stated: ‚ÄúMr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus‚Äù. Scotland Yard stated that inquiries into the circumstances of how Litvinenko became ill would continue. On 24 November 2006, a posthumous statement was released, in which Litvinenko named Putin as the man behind his poisoning. Litvinenko's friend Alex Goldfarb, who was also the chairman of Boris Berezovsky's Civil Liberties Fund, claimed Litvinenko had dictated it to him three days earlier. Andrei Nekrasov said his friend Litvinenko and Litvinenko's lawyer had composed the statement in Russian on 21 November's and translated it to English. An interview with Andrei Nekrasov by Yury Veksler, Radio Liberty, 28 November 2006. Litvinenko's grave at Highgate Cemetery in 2007. Putin disputed the authenticity of this note while attending a Russia-EU summit in Helsinki and claimed it was being used for political purposes. ( at WebCite) Goldfarb later stated that Litvinenko, on his deathbed, had instructed him to write a note \\"in good English\\" in which Putin was to be accused of his poisoning. Goldfarb also stated that he read the note to Litvinenko in English and Russian and Litvinenko agreed \\"with every word of it\\" and signed it. ( at WebCite) Litvinenko's grave in 2017. His autopsy took place on 1 December at the Royal London Hospital's institute of pathology. It was attended by three physicians, including one chosen by the family and one from the Foreign Office. Litvinenko was buried at Highgate Cemetery (West side) in north London on 7 December. The police treated his death as a murder, although the London coroner's inquest was yet to be completed. ( at WebCite) In an interview with the BBC broadcast on 16 December 2006, Yuri Shvets said that Litvinenko had created a 'due diligence' report investigating the activities of an unnamed senior Kremlin official on behalf of a British company looking to invest \\"dozens of millions of dollars\\" in a project in Russia, and that the dossier contained damaging information about the senior Kremlin official. He said he was interviewed about his allegations by Scotland Yard detectives investigating Litvinenko's murder. British media reported that the poisoning and consequent death of Litvinenko was not widely covered in the Russian news media. ( at WebCite) =Funeral= On 7 December 2006, Litvinenko was buried at Highgate Cemetery with Muslim rites, including a Muslim prayer being said by an imam who was invited by one of Litvinenko's friends, Akhmed Zakayev, contrary to his wife's wishes of a non-denominational service at the grave. The funeral ceremony was followed by a private memorial at which the ensemble Tonus Peregrinus sang sacred music by Russian composers Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninov, Victor Kalinnikov, and three works by British composer Antony Pitts. =Investigations into death= UK criminal investigation On 20 January 2007, British police announced that they had \\"identified the man they believe poisoned Alexander Litvinenko. The suspected killer was captured on cameras at Heathrow as he flew into Britain to carry out the murder.\\" The man in question was introduced to Litvinenko as \\"Vladislav\\". As of 26 January 2007, British officials said police had solved the murder of Litvinenko. They discovered \\"a 'hot' teapot at London's Millennium Hotel with an off-the-charts reading for polonium-210, the radioactive material used in the killing.\\" In addition, a senior official said investigators had concluded the murder of Litvinenko was \\"a 'state-sponsored' assassination orchestrated by Russian security services.\\" The police want to charge former Russian spy Andrei Lugovoy, who met Litvinenko on 1 November 2006, the day officials believe the lethal dose of polonium-210 was administered. On the same day, The Guardian reported that the British government was preparing an extradition request asking that Andrei Lugovoy be returned to the UK to stand trial for Litvinenko's murder. On 22 May 2007, the Crown Prosecution Service called for the extradition of Russian citizen Andrei Lugovoy to the UK on charges of murder. Lugovoy dismissed the claims against him as \\"politically motivated\\" and said he did not kill Litvinenko. A British police investigation resulted in several suspects for the murder, but in May 2007, the British Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, announced that his government would seek to extradite Andrei Lugovoy, the chief suspect in the case, from Russia. On 28 May 2007, the British Foreign Office officially submitted a request to the Government of Russia for the extradition of Lugovoy to face criminal charges in the UK. On 2 October 2011, The Sunday Times published an article wherein the chief prosecutor who investigated the murder of Litvinenko, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, publicly spoke of his suspicion that the murder was a \\"state directed execution\\" carried out by Russia. Until that time, British public officials had stopped short of directly accusing Russia of involvement in the poisoning. \\"It had all the hallmarks of a state directed execution, committed on the streets of London by a foreign government,\\" Macdonald added. In January 2015, it was reported in the UK media that the National Security Agency had intercepted communications between Russian government agents in Moscow and those who carried out what was called a \\"state execution\\" in London: the recorded conversations allegedly proved that the Russian government was involved in Litvinenko's murder, and suggested that the motive was Litvinenko's revelations about Vladimir Putin's links with the criminal underworld. On 21 January 2016, the Home Office published The Litvinenko Inquiry: Report into Litvinenko's death. Russian criminal investigation Many publications in Russian media suggested that the death of Alexander Litvinenko was connected to Boris Berezovsky. Former FSB chief Nikolay Kovalyov, for whom Litvinenko worked, said that the incident \\"looks like the hand of Boris Berezovsky. I am sure that no kind of intelligence services participated.\\" This involvement of Berezovsky was alleged by numerous Russian television shows. Kremlin supporters saw it as a conspiracy to smear the Russian government's reputation by engineering a spectacular murder of a Russian dissident abroad.\\"Russian Billionaire's Bitter Feud With Putin A Plot Line in Poisoning\\", The Washington Post Retrieved on 6 April 2008 After Litvinenko's death, traces of polonium-210 were found in an office of Berezovsky. Litvinenko had visited Berezovsky's office as well as many other places in the hours after his poisoning. The British Health Protection Agency made extensive efforts to ensure that locations Litvinenko visited and anyone who had contact with Litvinenko after his poisoning, were not at risk. Russian prosecutors were not allowed to investigate the office.Lugovoy case unsubstantial: Russian prosecution Russian authorities have also been unable to question Berezovsky. The Foreign Ministry complained that Britain was obstructing its attempt to send prosecutors to London to interview more than 100 people, including Berezovsky.\\"Send Berezovsky back and we'll help with Litvinenko case, says Russia\\", Times Online. Retrieved on 6 April 2008 On 5 July 2007, Russia officially declined to extradite Lugovoy, citing Article 61 of the Constitution of Russia that prohibits extradition of citizens. Russia has said that they could take on the case themselves if Britain provided evidence against Lugovoy but Britain has not handed over any evidence. The head of the investigating committee at the General Prosecutor's Office said Russia has not yet received any evidence from Britain on Lugovoy. \\"We have not received any evidence from London of Lugovoy's guilt, and those documents we have are full of blank spaces and contradictions. ( at WebCite) However, the British ambassador to Russia, Anne Pringle, claimed that London has already submitted sufficient evidence to extradite him to Britain. ( at WebCite) Judicial inquiries =Inquest in London= On 13 October 2011, Dr. Andrew Reid, the Coroner of St. Pancras, announced that he would hold an inquest into Litvinenko's death, which would include the examination of all existing theories of the murder, including possible complicity of the Russian government.\\"Litvinenko coroner to examine if Russian state behind killing\\", The Daily Telegraph (London). 13 October 2011 The inquest, held by Sir Robert Owen, a High Court judge acting as the coroner, originally scheduled to start on 1 May 2013, was subject to a series of pre-hearings: firstly, the coroner agreed that a group representing Russian state prosecutors could be accepted as a party to the inquest process; secondly, the British Government submitted a Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificate. Under Public Interest Immunity (PII) claims, the information at the disposal of the UK government relating to Russian state involvement, as well as how much British intelligence services could have done to prevent the death, would be excluded from the inquest. On 12 July 2013, Sir Robert, who had previously agreed to exclude certain material from the inquest on the grounds its disclosure could be damaging to national security, announced that the British Government refused the request he had made earlier in June to replace the inquest with a public inquiry, which would have powers to consider secret evidence. After the hearing, Alex Goldfarb said: \\"There's some sort of collusion behind the scenes with Her Majesty's government and the Kremlin to obstruct justice\\"; Elena Tsirlina, Mrs Litvinenko's solicitor, concurred with him. On 22 July 2014, the UK Home Secretary Theresa May, who had previously ruled out an inquiry on the grounds it might damage the country's relations with Moscow, announced a public inquiry into Litvinenko's death. The inquiry was chaired by Sir Robert Owen who was the Coroner in the inquest into Litvinenko's death; its remit stipulated that \\"the inquiry will not address the question of whether the UK authorities could or should have taken steps which would have prevented the death\\". The inquiry started on 27 January 2015. New evidence emerged at first hearings held at the end of January 2015. The last day of hearings was on 31 July 2015. The inquiry report was released on 21 January 2016. The report found that Litvinenko was killed by two Russian agents, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun and that there was a \\"strong probability\\" they were acting on behalf of the Russian FSB secret service. Paragraph 10.6 of the report stated: \\"The FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin.\\" The Report outlined five possible motives for the murder: a belief Litvinenko had betrayed the FSB through public disclosures about its work; a belief that he was working for British intelligence; because he was a prominent associate of leading opponents of Mr Putin and his regime, including Mr Boris Berezovsky and Akhmed Zakayev; because his claims about the FSB were \\"areas of particular sensitivity to the Putin administration\\", including a plot to murder dissident Boris Berezovsky; and because there was ‚Äúundoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\\" between Litvinenko and Putin, culminating in his allegation that Putin was a paedophile. On the release of the report, British Prime Minister David Cameron condemned Putin for presiding over \\"state sponsored murder\\". British Labour MP Ian Austin said: \\"Putin is an unreconstructed KGB thug and gangster who murders his opponents in Russia and, as we know, on the streets of London‚Äîand nothing announced today is going to make the blindest bit of difference.\\" The Kremlin dismissed the Inquiry as \\"a joke\\" and \\"whitewash\\". The same day, British Home Secretary Theresa May announced that assets belonging to both Lugovoi and Kovtun would be immediately frozen and that the Metropolitan Police were seeking their extradition. The Russian Ambassador was also summoned by the British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and demands were made that Russia cooperate with the investigation into Mr Litvinenko's murder with Foreign Office minister David Liddington asserting that Russia had demonstrated \\"a flagrant disregard for UK law, international law and standards of conduct, and the safety of UK citizens\\" However, the government's response to the inquiry's results has been described by The Economist as consisting of \\"tough talk and little action\\". =Litvinenko vs. the Russian Federation in Strasbourg= In May 2007, Marina Litvinenko registered a complaint against the Russian Federation in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, accusing the Russian state of violating her husband's right to life, and failing to conduct a full investigation.Strasbourg court sets deadline for Russia on Litvinenko case RIA Novosti 15 December 2010 In popular culture * Rebellion: the Litvinenko Case is a documentary about Litvinenko's activities and death. * The Litvinenko Project is a live-performance devised by 2Magpies Theatre (Nottingham, UK) exploring the possibilities which lead to Litvinenko's poisoning * An episode of BuzzFeed Unsolved aired about his death in August 2018. * An opera The Life & Death of Alexander Litvinenko by Anthony Bolton, libretto Kit Hesketh-Harvey.

A copy of this film is held by the Library of Congress. Plot A gruff sea captain (Walter Long) enlists fish-shop employees Laurel and Hardy to help in shanghaiing men to be a crew for his next voyage. They succeed in doing so by a stunt that gets each man to chase after Laurel, whereupon Hardy frying-pans the pursuing sailor and knocks him out. But they accidentally clobber the captain as well, provoking him into shanghaiing them as well aboard what is rumored to be a \\"ghost ship\\" (which was why Captain Long was unable to get men to voluntarily enlist). He is so angry at this rumor that he makes a dire threat against the next man that so much as even utters the word \\"ghost\\" in his earshot --- \\"I'll take his head and I'll twist it around so that when he's walkin' north he'll be lookin' south!\\" When Captain Long gives his men shore leave, the boys opt to remain on board, fearing the men they shanghaied would seek revenge if they were not under the captain's jurisdiction. Preparing to head ashore himself, Captain Long asks The Boys to keep an eye on a drunken shipmate (Arthur Housman) and make sure he stays aboard ship. But he sneaks off anyway, and then while later staggering back to the ship in a state of liquor-hazed oblivion, falls into a tub of whitewash, then comes back onboard and crawls into his bunk to sleep it off. Sometime later the boys accidentally discharge a pistol, and mistakenly believing that they've shot the passed-out sailor, they toss his sleeping body --- still wrapped in his bedsheet, and thus they have not yet seen him in his whitened state --- overboard, but he promptly wakes up and climbs back on board. When the duo next see him, they're convinced he's the ghost of the \\"dead\\" sailor and run around the deck shrieking in terror. Meanwhile, the shanghaied sailors have been plotting revenge against the duo for shanghaiing them and decide to sneak back aboard the ship to clobber The Boys during the captain's absence. When they get to the ship and see Laurel and Hardy running, they begin to pursue them‚Äîonly to be stopped when they see what they're running from: the drunken sailor covered in whitewash, which they too mistake for a ghost and jump overboard shrieking in terror. Captain Long returns with a barfly (Mae Busch) whom he has talked into joining him, only for her to recognize the whitewashed sailor as the husband who'd deserted her years ago. She chases the drunken man off the ship with her furled umbrella. Irate and disappointed at this turn of events, Captain Long is further enraged by Laurel and Hardy when they both tell him that they saw a ghost. He thereupon carries out his threat: he twists their heads around so they will be facing backwards. Hardy wearily utters his \\"Another nice mess...\\" catchphrase; Stan performs his classic, \\"Oh, I couldn't help it\\" whimpers in reply.

It deals with the mysterious behaviour of a valuable scientist and his relationship with the private investigator tasked with investigating him. Plot summary Blaise Skiaki is a brilliant perfume developer, an industry which has become vitally important since water scarcity has made regular bathing impossible for most people. Skiaki's employers have become concerned about his erratic behaviour, in particular his habit of disappearing for several hours some nights, which they initially suspect to be evidence of corporate espionage of some kind. They hire Gretchen Nunn, a famed private investigator, who becomes Skiaki's lover and discovers that he vanishes for exactly four hours every time, that he appears to be in a fugue state during these periods, and that every state terminates with a murder. She is, however, unable to trail him in order to determine whether he is responsible for the murders himself. During this time, Skiaki gives Nunn a jewel, which she wears in her belly button. She encounters him during his fugue state and hears him refer to himself as Mr. Wish. She eventually discovers that his talent for perfumery has led to him being able to detect human pheromone trails, and that he is following the trails of individuals who have a death wish. Before Nunn is able to act on this information, Skiaki reveals to her that she is in fact blind, something she is unaware of due to a telepathic ability to view the world through the eyes of others. Horrified by this revelation, Nunn flees, only to be confronted by Skiaki in his murderous Mr. Wish persona. Several other men appear, and reveal in conversation with Mr. Wish that they are the ones responsible for the murders, having followed him each time he goes into a fugue state, though their motivation is not made clear. They strip Nunn of her clothes, and the sight of the gem in her belly button prompts Skiaki to escape from his fugue state and aid her in overcoming her attackers. Skiaki is able to return to work, apparently in control of his fugue states now. He and Nunn discuss their shared revelations regarding their own natures, as well as their future, eventually deciding to continue their romantic relationship.

Its parent company was 17th in the list of the largest candy companies in the world, with sales amounting to $1.196 billion. History \\"I eat cookies from the Red October factory, the former Einem\\". Advertisement from the early Soviet era. The company was founded by the German Theodor Ferdinand von Einem. Von Einem sold his stake in the enterprise to German Julius Heuss, who became its director in 1878, retaining the position until his death in 1907. In 1896, the Einem factory won a gold medal at the All-Russian Industrial and Artistic Exhibition, and it was allowed to supply confectionery to the court of the tsar. At the turn of the 20th century, the Einem factory won chocolatiers' competitions across Europe, and its advertising was displayed prominently in Moscow. After the October Revolution of 1917, the company was nationalised and given its current name. During World War II, the factory reoriented its production towards the manufacturing of military rations, including high- caffeine chocolate. After the fall of the Soviet regime, the company continued to use the Krasny Oktyabr name for its brand recognition, but it began to decorate the boxes and labels with Tsarist-era motifs. Krasny Oktyabr was privatised in 1993. In the 1990s, it became one of the few large business concerns in Moscow to be privatised successfully. At the same time, it had to compete with foreign companies such as Mars Inc.

The plant was relocated to the outskirts of Moscow in 2007, and the famous red brick factory was redeveloped into apartment complexes, cafes and restaurants. The development hosts art and photo galleries and designer studios, being described as Moscow‚Äôs answer to New York‚Äôs Tribeca.

Background When Roman Emperor Valerian rose to power in October 253, he had his son Gallienus elevated to the position of co-emperor. While Valerian was fighting against the Sassanid Empire and the Goths, who by that time had sacked Thrace and Asia Minor, Gallienus remained in Italia, in charge of defending the Roman Empire's borders there from Germanic tribes (\\"barbarians\\"). In the Western half of the Empire, the border situation was difficult. The Danubian frontier resisted continuous barbarian attacks. Gallienus marched with military reinforcements from Gaul towards Dacia and Moesia to confront the barbarian threat. The situation was so perilous that in 259, the legions of Pannonia and Moesia rebelled and declared Ingenuus as emperor. Gallienus eventually reunited the Rhine, left behind Legio II Parthica to defend it, and went off to subdue the barbarians. Preliminary moves Within the borders of the Rhine River and the Alps, a Germanic confederation, the Alamanni, who occupied a good part of the Agri Decumates (the territory located between the mouth of the Rhine and the Danube), crossed the Alpine steps and attacked the fertile plain of the Po River. The sacking of the area instilled fear in the city of Rome, the empire's capital, as it had yet to become a walled city. The Senate of Rome hastily organized a contingency of plebs for combat in an attempt to ensure that the shrinking army was capable of protecting the city. Gallienus had just defeated the pretender Ingenuus when news arrived of the invasion by the Alamanni. He marched off with the legions I Adiutrix, II Italica, and II Parthica to intercept the barbarians in Italy. By then, according to the Byzantine historian Joannes Zonaras, the Alamanni had retreated before the unexpected resistance of the citizens of Rome and its Senate. Battle When Gallienus arrived in the Po valley, he found the Alamanni in the vicinity of Mediolanum, present day Milan. According to Zonaras, 300,000 Alamanni fell in the ensuing battle and the emperor received the title Germanicus Maximus. Aftermath The Alamanni's success in attacking into the Roman Empire once more revealed the weakness of the centuries-old tradition of posting Rome's legions near the frontiers without providing adequate defense within the empire's borders. The battle of Mediolanum demonstrated to the Romans the vulnerability of Italy and the value of swift, flexible military units. Afterward, Gallienus enacted a major reform by introducing a highly mobile field army composed mainly of cavalry (vexillationes). The main units were under the control of his General, Aureolus, and headquartered in Mediolanum, with the mission to protect Italy. The barbarian attack led the Roman Senate to try and regain its authority by arming and commanding its own military forces to meet the Germanic threat. But, uncomfortable with this challenge to his power, Emperor Gallienus suppressed all of the senate's military prerogatives. The fear caused by the incursion later resulted in Emperor Aurelian having a wall constructed to defend the city of Rome itself. References Bibliography *Francesco Bertolini.

Biography Carvalho was raised in a middle-class family in Rio de Janeiro's South Zone. Her father, Jo√£o Francisco Leal de Carvalho, was a lawyer. She grew up influenced by different types of music. Her father used to take her to samba school rehearsals, and her mother was a lover of classical music who encouraged her to become a ballerina. She started playing the guitar as a teenager, and got involved with the emerging Bossa Nova movement, winning a nationwide song contest on TV at the age of 19. Following a 1967 album, \\"Muito Na Onda,\\" with the project 'Conjunto 3D,' Carvalho did her first solo record, 1968's \\"Andan√ßa\\", and carried the song of the same name to victory in a larger festival, which brought her to prominence. Although she started her career with Bossa Nova, that was an ephemeral phase which lasted less than one year. Beth started dedicating herself entirely to samba just as her fame began, working with legendary composers such as Nelson Sargento. Carvalho is a very important artist in the history of samba, as she celebrated and brought the spotlight to the work of legendary composers such as Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho & Guilherme de Brito when they weren't receiving the attention they deserved. Almost all of her records have songs by these composers, among other legendary sambistas such as Nelson Sargento and the Old Guard of Portela. Her samba school was Mangueira, but that didn't stop her from recording dozens of songs from composers of Portela, the other great traditional samba school in Rio. National Archives of Brazil. Later, in the late 1970s and early 80s, Beth helped bring to the public the work of other rising pagode artists from Cacique de Ramos, such as Almir Guineto, Jorge Arag√£o and the Fundo de Quintal group. Then, in 1983, she introduced Zeca Pagodinho who would become the major samba name of the 90s. Carvalho always tried to bring underrated composers the recognition they deserve, and she is regarded as madrinha do samba (the godmother of samba). She was a driving force in the modernization of samba in the 80s, and at the same time rejected commercial pop trends in samba arrangements, preserving tradition. In the 1990s, Beth's popularity wasn't the strongest, but she was always popular. She recorded an album dedicated to the samba from S√£o Paulo, rejecting the famous axiom that \\"S√£o Paulo is the grave of samba\\". In 1998 she recorded an album dedicated entirely to the pagode classics, P√©rolas do Pagode (Pagode Pearls). alt= In the new millennium, Beth worked more than ever, releasing CDs and DVDs. With a career that spanned 40 years, she was a historical figure in Brazilian culture, and recognized as the female sambista with the most substantial opus in Brazil, without diminishing other, younger stars such as Clara Nunes and Daniela Mercury. Trivia * Beth was a known supporter of both the Botafogo and Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro football teams * Beth was one of the main personalities of the samba school Mangueira * Beth had a variety of hits in the 1970s, with her 1979 song \\"Coisinha Do Pai\\" being one of her biggest hits.

It was established in April 1946 and was first called Mindoro Junior College until January 1981. The first year was in normal education, liberal arts, pre-law, including short term courses in typing and stenography (July 1, 1946). History The Divine World College of Calapan, as a Catholic institution of higher learning, goes back to the missionary work of Fr. Benito Rixner, SVD and other missionaries of the Society of the Divine Word in Mindoro. Mindoro Junior College, as the school was first called, was established in April 1946. The formal opening of classes in first year Normal Education, Liberal Arts, Pre-Law, and special short-term courses in Typing and Stenography was on July 1, 1946. There were thirty-seven students as first enrollees. The first floor of the old bishop's residence was used for classrooms by the students and ten (10) faculty members. The biggest room served as library with around a thousand volumes coming from other SVD schools and the rest from donations. The regular residence rooms were used as classrooms while the smallest room became the Registrar's Office. Athletic activities were held at the church plaza. In 1953, Fr. Albert Cook, SVD who was the Director then, constructed a two-storey building on a lot purchased adjacent to the two original structures. Construction was completed just in time for the school year 1953‚Äì1954. By that time, there were just three buildings being housing about a thousand students until around 1964. From 1954 through 1964, enrolment increased steadily and, through the efforts of Bishop William Duschak, SVD, DD, who went to Europe to ask for donations from friends and benefactors, the dream of a modern college in a spacious compound materialized. During the school year 1964‚Äì1965, all classes were moved to the new campus. About the same time, the Elementary Department was inaugurated by virtue of the Temporary Permit No. 96. In 1975, the President, Fr. Eleuterio S. Lacaron, SVD, also introduced the School Campaign Program. In 1976, permission was granted by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) for the revival of the Graduate School Program which was phased out in 1972. Meanwhile, the college curriculum was further diversified with the inclusion of the short- term courses and the offering of traditional fields of concentration in the degree programs. In 1980, the course in Master in Business Administration (MBA) was offered by virtue of Temporary Permit No.132, s. 1985 dated July 1980 with forty-seven (47) students and three (3) professors. Recognition was granted in June 1985, signed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Sports, Jaime C. Laya. In January 1981, the name of the college was changed from Mindoro Junior College to Divine Word College of Calapan - making it more identified with the educational apostolate of the Society of the Divine Word in the province of Oriental Mindoro. In 1987, the Divine Word College of Calapan was granted Level II accreditation for five (5) years by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). On April 2, 1993 another Level II accreditation was granted, and a re-accreditation in 1998. A non-degree program in Computer Science was opened during the administration of Fr. Joel L. Maribao, to give the youth of Mindoro and its neighboring provinces the opportunity to learn the new technology. The Associate in Computer Data Processing (ACDP) was recognized during the school year 1994‚Äì1995, while the two-year course in Computer System and Business Management (CSBM) was given Permit No. TV-P 059, s. 1994. In 1995, the Civil Engineering Department was acknowledged as Top 1 in Region IV and Top 10 at the National Level credited to the high percentage of its board passers. This was published in the Philippine Star on June 13, 1995. Another honor was received by DWCC as per CHED Memorandum No. 76, s. 1995, when DWCC was selected as Center for Excellence in Teacher Education for Region IV. It was also during the time of Fr. Eleuterio S. Lacaron, SVD (1994‚Äì1995), that DWCC was named Institute of Local Government Academy (ILGA) in Oriental Mindoro by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). During the administration of Fr. Romeo P. Bancale, SVD, the DWCC Graduate School was granted permit to offer two (2) new graduate programs, Master in Public Administration and Doctor of Philosophy in Management, by virtue of the Government Recognition Nos. 27 and 28, s. 1997, made effective in the school year 1997‚Äì1998. It was also in that same year that the High School Department moved out from the main campus to the Janssen campus located in Brgy. Pachoca, Calapan City. The campus has been renamed Freinademetz Campus. In 2000, during the term of Fr. Ernesto F. Vitor, SVD, government permits were granted to offer Bachelor of Science in Office Administration, Bachelor of Science in Tourism, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, including associate courses in Office Administration, Tourism, and HRM using the ladderized curriculum. In 2002, the Elementary Department building located adjacent to the High School Department building at the Freinademetz campus was completed. In the succeeding year, the Elementary Department transferred to its new site, thus housing together the Basic Education Department in that campus. Another milestone for the institution was again achieved when the DWCC-SIFE team of the Student In Free Enterprise (SIFE) was acclaimed the national champion in the SIFE National Exposition held at the Holiday Inn, Manila in February 2002. Later, the said team represented the country in the prestigious SIFE World Cup in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September of the same year. In 2005, Jose Lemuel Dimaunahan topped the November 2005 Electronics and Communications Engineering board examination while Heidi Libed topped the 2005 Licensure Examination for Teachers in Region IV.

Bayh‚ÄìCeller amendment The closest the United States has come to abolishing the Electoral College occurred during the 91st Congress (1969‚Äì1971).For a more detailed account of this proposal read The Politics of Electoral College Reform by Lawrence D. Longley and Alan G. Braun (1972) The presidential election of 1968 resulted in Richard Nixon receiving 301 electoral votes (56% of electors), Hubert Humphrey 191 (35.5%), and George Wallace 46 (8.5%) with 13.5% of the popular vote. However, Nixon had received only 511,944 more popular votes than Humphrey, 43.5% to 42.9%, less than 1% of the national total.1968 Electoral College Results, National Archives and Records Administration Representative Emanuel Celler (D‚ÄìNew York), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, responded to public concerns over the disparity between the popular vote and electoral vote by introducing House Joint Resolution 681, a proposed Constitutional amendment that would have replaced the Electoral College with a simpler two-round system based on the national popular vote, similar to that used in French presidential elections. With this system, the pair of candidates who had received the highest number of votes would win the presidency and vice presidency provided they won at least 40% of the national popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election. The word \\"pair\\" was defined as \\"two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President.\\" On April 29, 1969, the House Judiciary Committee voted 28 to 6 to approve the proposal. Debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives ended on September 11, 1969 and was eventually passed with bipartisan support on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339 to 70. On September 30, 1969, President Richard Nixon gave his endorsement for adoption of the proposal, encouraging the Senate to pass its version of the proposal, which had been sponsored as Senate Joint Resolution 1 by Senator Birch Bayh (D‚ÄìIndiana). On October 8, 1969, the New York Times reported that 30 state legislatures were \\"either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embodying the direct election plan if it passes its final Congressional test in the Senate.\\" Ratification of 38 state legislatures would have been needed for adoption. The paper also reported that six other states had yet to state a preference, six were leaning toward opposition and eight were solidly opposed. On August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report advocating passage of the proposal to the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee had approved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6. The six members who opposed the plan, Democratic Senators James Eastland of Mississippi, John Little McClellan of Arkansas, and Sam Ervin of North Carolina, along with Republican Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska, Hiram Fong of Hawaii, and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, all argued that although the present system had potential loopholes, it had worked well throughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the full Senate. He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided Republican senators to support the proposal. However, Nixon, while not reneging on his previous endorsement, chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the proposal. On September 8, 1970, the Senate commenced openly debating the proposal and the proposal was quickly filibustered. The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern senators and conservatives from small states, both Democrats and Republicans, who argued abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states' political influence. On September 17, 1970, a motion for cloture, which would have ended the filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for cloture, failing to receive the required two-thirds majority of senators voting.The Senate in 1975 reduced the required vote for cloture from two thirds of those voting (66 votes) to three fifths (60 votes). See United States Senate website. A second motion for cloture on September 29, 1970, also failed, by 53 to 34. Thereafter, the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, moved to lay the proposal aside so the Senate could attend to other business. However, the proposal was never considered again and died when the 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971. Every Vote Counts Amendment The Every Vote Counts Amendment was a joint resolution to amend the United States Constitution, providing for the popular election of the president and vice president under a new electoral system. This proposed constitutional amendment sought to abolish the Electoral College presidential elections and to have every presidential election determined by a plurality of the national vote. It was introduced by Representative Gene Green (D) Texas on January 4, 2005. Representative Green then again introduced the legislation on January 7, 2009 as . Later, two similar joint resolutions were introduced, a measure sponsored by Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. (D) Illinois, that would require a majority vote for president, and one sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson (D) Florida, that would leave the method of election to an Act of Congress. All three resolutions died in committee during the 111th Congress. =Text of proposed amendment= =Background= Section 1, 3, and 4 relate to the process of the election. Section 1 states that the President and Vice President will be elected by the residents of states. Section 3 states that the election is won by the candidate supported by a plurality of votes cast. There is no provision for a run-off in the event that no candidate wins by an overall majority. Section 4 pushes the joint candidacy requirement enacted by all states. To prevent misinterpretation for voters by having too many choices, candidates can not be joined by more than one other person on the ballot. Section 2 relates to the voter qualifications in three implementations. The first implementation is re-using requirements for qualification to vote that were established and used for the electoral system. The qualifications stated in Article 1 section 2, also the 17th Amendment pushed by the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th and 26th Amendments. The second implementation would affect the resident periods in states, allowing states to make little to no waiting periods to vote if one changed residence of state. The last implementation would allow Congress to input age requirements for elections and establish uniform residence. Pushing past the 26th Amendment and making the age requirement higher or lower. Section 5 would give power to Congress. If the Amendment was put into place, and a candidate died or there was a tie between two candidates it would allow Congress to make decisions depending on the event if it was to take place. Such as, postponing an election. Section 5 gives more power to Congress over the election process and system. Section 6 relates to if the Amendment was to be put into place. As long as the Amendment is put into place one year before the next election the Amendment would be used on the next Presidential election. Boxer and Cohen proposals On November 15, 2016, Senator Barbara Boxer of California introduced a proposal to abolish the electoral college and to provide for the direct popular election of the President and Vice President of the United States by the voters in the various states and the District of Columbia.114th Congress, Representative Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) introduced a companion resolution in the House of Representatives on January 5, 2017. Unlike the Bayh‚ÄìCeller amendment 40% threshold for election, Cohen's proposal only requires a candidate to have the \\"greatest number of votes\\" to be elected.H.J.

In his junior year, after running through cash reserves on his narrative student film, he took a job as assistant to the assistant of editor in chief Jim Shooter. This led to an editorial job at the Marvel Comics imprint Epic Comics following his graduation. Working as an assistant editor from 1985 to 1986, he was promoted to editor in 1987. Chichester worked in that capacity at Epic until 1989. He left Marvel's staff that year to pursue freelance writing and editing full-time. Beginning in 1987, Chichester added to his editorial role and began writing comics for Marvel ‚Äî and, after leaving staff, for other publishers. His credits include Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. in 1990‚Äì1992, and Nightstalkers in 1992-1993.

History  The Divine Word College of Urdaneta is one of the earlier university and college owned and managed by the Society of the Divine Word, popularly known as the Divine Word Missionaries. It has evolved from a small educational institution in Urdaneta City to a source of quality Catholic education in the region. Early in 1963, the Society of the Divine Word opened a seminary of its own in Urdaneta City, Pangasinan. Later, the idea of adding a high school and college was approved. Father Augustine Herbers, SVD was in charge of the project. A 6.5 hectare lot was bought from the Sison family in 1964. To find funds for the building, Fr. Herbers went to Germany and sought the help of his friends. On March 20, 1966 the Most Reverend Archbishop Mariano Madriaga, D.D, blessed the cornerstone of the building. By the school year 1967-1968, the three-story building was ready to open its doors to the first students. There were 165 high school and 72 college students and 8 seminarians enrolled. Fr. Herbers was the first seminary rector and Father George Harwardt, the first college director. At the end of that school year the first secretarial students graduated; the first high school graduation took place in 1970. From the first year the Divine Word College offered high school, secretarial, commerce, liberal arts and education degrees. Fr. Harwardt was transferred to Manila in 1970 and Fr. Herbers became director with Frs. Francis Cuylen and Cecil Floresca as his assistants. Due to the very urgent need for a new building to accommodate the growing student population, Fr. Herbers had to go to Germany again to seek funds for the construction at the beginning of the school year 1972-1973. In his absence, Fr. Panfilo Gianan, a Filipino, became director with Fr. Fabia, also a Filipino, as prefect of the seminarians and treasurer of the college. The Divine Word College of Urdaneta opened its pre-elementary department in 2003 and its elementary department in 2005.  Administration  The Divine Word College of Urdaneta is under the administration and spiritual direction of the Society of the Divine Word. The SVD (Latin: Societas Verbi Divini) is a Roman Catholic international organization of religious priests and brothers founded in 1875 by a German priest, Saint Arnold Janssen. Its members, over 6,000 strong, are working in 35 countries as missionaries and educators. In the Philippines, the Central House of the Divine Word Missionaries is the Divine Word Seminary in E. Rodriguez Boulevard, Quezon City. In Urdaneta, a minor seminary is attached to the Divine Word College where young aspirants study with the high school boys and girls. More than 60 institutions of learning in the Philippines are owned or directed by the Divine Word Missionaries.  School Presidents  The DWCU has been serving the thirteen SVD priests since the year when the school was built. On June 22, 2017 Fr. Roberto J. Ibay, SVD was installed as the 13th President of the Divine Word College of Urdaneta preceding Fr. Gil T. Manalo, SVD who is now in Divine Word College of Bangued in Abra, also serves today as president of that institution. *Fr. George Hardwart, SVD (1967 -1970) *Fr. Augustine Herbers, SVD and Fr.

According to history, Fray Andres Urdaneta, after whom the town is named, had a fortress in his coat-of-arms or seal. The orb surmounted by a cross represents the Society of the Divine Word, a missionary organization, whose members run the college. The cross is also used to symbolize the Divine Word College itself because, being a Catholic institution of learning, it contributes to the spiritual and moral upliftment of the community. What appears as rays emanating from the cross are the four letter Vs of the college motto: \\"Verbo Veritatis, Verbo Vitae\\" (To the Word of Truth, to the Word of Life). This is a dedication of the school to Christ who calls Himself the Truth and the Life. The motto is also an avowal of the aims of the school, namely, to bring the truth and the Christian way of life to its students. Saint Joseph Freinademetz, the first SVD missionary to China, is the patron saint and model of the school.

A committed Christian, he was a lifelong Anglican ‚Äì a member of the Church of Ireland. Throughout his life, he was a lay preacher. Bleakley joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) and contested the Northern Ireland Parliament seat of Belfast Victoria in 1949 and 1953 before finally winning it in 1958. At Stormont, he was made the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, but he lost his seat in 1965. Bleakley was head of the department of economics and political studies at Methodist College Belfast from 1969 to 1979. Bleakley ran for the Westminster seat of Belfast East in 1970 (gaining 41% of the vote), February 1974 and October 1974 for the Northern Ireland Labour Party each time, but never enough to win the Westminister seat from the UUP. In 1971, Brian Faulkner appointed him as his Minister for Community Relations at Stormont, but as Bleakley was not an MP, he could only hold this post for six months. He resigned five days before his term expired in order to highlight his disagreement with government policy, specifically the failure to widen the government to include non-Unionist parties, and the decision to introduce internment.Bleakley resigns calling for new approach in government, The Irish Times, 27 September 1971, p. 5 Bleakley wrote a respectful biography of Faulkner Bleakley, David.

He stood again for Belfast East in the February and October UK general elections, but won only 14% of the vote each time. By the late 1970s, the NILP was in disarray, and did not stand a candidate for the 1979 European Assembly election. Bleakley instead stood as an \\"Independent Community Candidate\\", but took only 1.6% of the votes cast. During the 1980s, Bleakley sat as a non- partisan member of various quangos. From 1980 to 1992 he was general secretary of the Irish Council of Churches. In 1992, he joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and was an advisor to the group during the all-party talks. For the 1996 Northern Ireland Forum election, he was a prominent member of the Democratic Partnership list and stood in Belfast East, but was not elected. In 1998, he joined the Labour Party of Northern Ireland and stood in Belfast East in the Assembly elections, receiving 369 first preference votes.

The film is about a hard-drinking, lonely veteran cop, Murphy (Paul Newman), and his young partner Corelli (Ken Wahl), who work in a crime-ridden precinct in The Bronx. Although Murphy's life takes a good turn when he falls in love with Isabella (Rachel Ticotin), a young nurse, the arrival of a new, law-and-order-minded police captain commanding the precinct, Connoly (Ed Asner) threatens to tip the neighborhood's delicate balance into anarchy. Danny Aiello, Kathleen Beller, and Pam Grier play supporting roles. It was written by Heywood Gould and produced by Martin Richards and Thomas Fiorello, with David Susskind as executive producer. It was filmed on location in the Bronx. Author Tom Walker sued Time-Life Television, alleging that the film infringed on his book Fort Apache, but lost after a lengthy court battle. At the time of its filming and release, the movie caused controversy, as Hispanic and African-Americans objected to their depiction as drug dealers and criminals. The film received mixed reviews; however, Newman's acting was noted as a strength of the film. In addition, the film was the main inspiration for the long running police drama series Hill Street Blues. Plot summary Police officers face many challenges in the decaying, impoverished, high-crime South Bronx region of New York City. Among these officers are NYPD officers Murphy (Paul Newman) and Corelli (Ken Wahl), who work out of the 41st Precinct, nicknamed \\"Fort Apache\\" because to those who work there, it feels like an army outpost in foreign territory. The streets are filled with dangerous gangs, criminals, and drug dealers. Unemployment is very high and the neighborhood is filled with garbage and wrecked buildings. While Murphy is a hard-drinking and lonely divorced father, he has a great camaraderie with Corelli. Murphy's life also improves when he meets a young nurse, Isabella (Rachel Ticotin), and they start a romantic relationship. The precinct is one of the worst and most dilapidated in the entire department, approaching demolition and staffed mostly by officers who are unwanted by, and have been transferred out of, other precincts. Additionally, the precinct's officers do not represent the large Puerto Rican community, as only 4% of the officers are Hispanic in the largest non-English speaking section of The Bronx. Corelli and Murphy attempt to maintain law and order by catching pimps and robbers, but they have conflicts with corrupt fellow officers, and a newly appointed police captain, Connolly (Ed Asner). There is rioting due to alleged police brutality, as well as issues related to the deaths of two rookie cops, who were shot by a drug addict at the film's beginning. During the riot, Murphy and Corelli witness an officer throwing an innocent teenager off an apartment roof to his death. As Murphy becomes more intimate with Isabella, they begin a sexual relationship. While she is sleeping, Murphy notices \\"track marks\\" on her skin. She later admits that she uses heroin as a way to relax from working in such a stressful environment. She tells him that other hospital employees also use heroin. Illustrating the futility of policing in the precinct, the killer of the two cops is never found, despite mass arrests and interrogations. The drug addict who killed them is later also killed and her body is shown as an anonymous bundle dumped in roadside trash. Murphy is broken when Isabella dies from a drug overdose and wrestles with the moral question of whether he should maintain the \\"blue code\\" and not inform authorities about the officer who threw the teen off the roof. Murphy decides to resign and report the killing, a decision that will make other officers hate him and view him as a \\"stool pigeon\\". Murphy seems to be on the verge of quitting the force, when he sees the purse snatcher fleeing from a house he burglarized. Murphy and Corelli chase the robber, and the image freezes as Murphy leaps to tackle him.

On Rotten Tomatoes, which collects both modern and contemporaneous review, the film has an 86% approval rating based on 14 reviews; the average rating is 6.6/10. Richard Schickel, in TIME, called it \\"more like a made-for-TV movie\\". He also added, \\"The film is not quite up to its star\\" and is \\"somewhere between Barney Miller and the works of Joseph Wambaugh\\".

Because of the dispute, the Post banned him from its pages, even removing his name from films in the TV listings. Legal issues Local community groups threatened to file suit against the producers because of the way it depicted their neighborhood in the Bronx and for the depiction of ethnic minorities (Blacks and Hispanics). Because of this pressure, some changes were made to the script and a note was added to the title card at the beginning of the film.Film: \\"Fort Apache, The Bronx\\". ‚Äì Variety. ‚Äì January 1, 1981. ‚Äì Retrieved: 2008-06-10Cultural Desk: \\"'Apache' Film's Debut Protested\\". ‚Äì The New York Times. ‚Äì February 7, 1981 In 1976, Tom Walker, a police officer who had been stationed at the 41st precinct, published Fort Apache (New York: Crowell, 1976. ), a non-fiction book about his experiences there. After the release of the film, Walker filed a lawsuit against its producers and writers alleging copyright infringement. Among other things, Walker argued that: \\"both the book and the film begin with the murder of a black and a white policeman with a handgun at close range; both depict cockfights, drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes and rats; both feature as central characters third- or fourth- generation Irish policemen who live in Queens and frequently drink; both show disgruntled, demoralized police officers and unsuccessful foot chases of fleeing criminals\\". Walker lost in federal district court, and again on appeal. The appeals court ruled that these are stereotypical ideas, so called \\"sc√®nes √† faire\\" (French for \\"scenes that must be done\\"), and that copyright law does not protect concepts or ideas. The court ruling stated: \\"the book Fort Apache and the film Fort Apache: The Bronx were not substantially similar beyond [the] level of generalized or otherwise nonprotectible ideas, and thus [the] latter did not infringe copyright of [the] former\\".Beeber, Jessie, and Maura Wogan. ‚Äì \\"Is Sc√®nes √† Faire Really 'Necessary'?\\". ‚Äì Entertainment, Arts and Sports Law Journal. ‚Äì Spring 2004. ‚Äì Vol. 15, No. 1 Newman also filed a claim against Time-Life claiming that they had undersold the TV rights (on which he was due 15%) by selling to HBO for $1.5 million and not offering it to others and also understated foreign distribution receipts by over $3.75 million on which he was due 12.5%.

Denis Buffet-Auger Denis Buffet-Auger, born Denis Buffet, was born 28 July 1783 in La Couture, near Dreux into a family of woodturners. He became known as Buffet-Auger after his marriage to Marie-Anne Auger. In 1825 he set up a workshop in Paris making instruments, a business that was to become the Buffet Crampon company, still in operation and one of the foremost manufacturers of woodwind instruments. Jean-Louis Buffet was his son. Denis Buffet-Auger died on 24 Sep 1841 in Paris. Auguste Buffet jeune Auguste Buffet jeune (full name Louis-Auguste Buffet) was born 6 August 1789 in La Couture, a younger brother of Denis Buffet-Auger. Auguste was making musical instruments in La Couture by 1813, but by 1830 had moved his workshop to Paris. In the 1830s he designed and built two new bass clarinets, developed an improved Boehm system flute (with flutist Victor Coche), and, with H.E. Klos√©, invented the so- called Boehm system clarinet, the system still most commonly in use for clarinets. In the early 1840s, with P.J.R. Soler, he developed a Boehm system oboe; this, however, was less successful. Louis-Auguste Buffet was his son. Auguste Buffet jeune died on 30 Sep 1864 in Anet. Jean-Louis Buffet Jean- Louis Buffet, also known as Jean-Louis Buffet-Crampon, was born 18 July 1813 in La Couture, son of Denis Buffet-Auger.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on October 12, 2000. Plot The episode begins with the gang celebrating Monica and Chandler's engagement, after Ross finally shows up after missing the proposal. Monica suggests that everyone dress up so that they can go to The Plaza for champagne. Joey announces that he cannot stay out too late as he has a commercial audition in the morning. He is auditioning for the role of a 19-year-old, which is 12 years younger than he is, and his efforts to \\"de-age\\" by dressing and acting like a teenager are met with ridicule. Phoebe, on the other hand, would love to sing at the wedding, and badgers Monica until she agrees just to get her to get dressed for the night. While everyone is getting ready, Monica and Chandler have an intimate moment, but are derailed when Chandler has an incident. Chandler leaves to confide in Joey, and later Rachel, for advice. Rachel herself meets up with Ross in the hallway and asks whether they will themselves marry other people in the future. The topic shifts to their relationship, and Rachel compliments Ross on how good he was in bed. She then says that they never had a \\"bonus night\\": two exes who have broken up get back together for one night of \\"no strings attached\\" sex. Suddenly, both are tempted by the idea, but Ross tries to tell Rachel that it is not a good idea for them to spend the night together. However, the next time Monica opens the door, she is shocked to see Ross and Rachel kissing at the threshold. When they try to apologize, Monica accuses Rachel of stealing her thunder, and preempting Monica's big night by getting back together with Ross. The two ex-lovers protest mightily, and Monica is almost convinced when Phoebe comes in, immediately misinterprets the situation and asks if she can sing at Ross and Rachel's wedding too. When Chandler and Joey return, Joey is also delighted at the \\"reunion\\", and Monica accuses Rachel of being unable to stand anyone else being in the spotlight. Rachel tries desperately to patch things up, but Monica is not in the mood to listen and cancels out on going to the Plaza. Chandler follows Monica into the bedroom to calm her down, and they begin to kiss, leading to a resurgence of Chandler's erection, but they are soon interrupted by Phoebe; Joey plants doubts in Phoebe's mind that Monica and Chandler will let them play at their wedding, so she begins demanding her down payment at this point. They refuse, culminating in her picketing their apartment, guitar in hand, over the rest of the episode. No sooner have Chandler and Monica reasserted their privacy, Rachel returns to make amends; unfortunately, this evolves into an even bigger fight, and Rachel storms out, telling Ross to come with her so they can have sex. Ross follows to Rachel's room where she tells him they are not really going to do it, she just wants Monica to think they are. She tries to maintain this illusion when Monica knocks on the door, but Ross refuses to play along. Rachel finally admits that seeing Monica and Chandler get engaged made her feel sad and lonely, and she turned to Ross for sex to feel better about herself; the thunder-stealing was unintentional. The girls make up, and Ross takes off. During the tag scene, Phoebe sings in the apartment when Chandler comes out of the bedroom having finally had sex with Monica. He gives Phoebe a down payment‚Äîone dollar‚Äîin exchange for Phoebe singing at their wedding. But when Phoebe starts asking who will perform the ceremony, he takes her guitar.

History  The Constitution Party of Oregon was first formed in August 1952 by Louise Gronnert, Gladys Whelen, and Virgil Holland. Its history since then has not been continuous, though its goals have remained fairly consistent. Headquartered in Portland, its stated purpose was to advance and promote interest in the U.S. constitution in schools and elsewhere. Its plans took shape in 1956, when it announced a nominating convention for president and vice president of the United States. The party opposed socialism, and did not field local candidates. It announced a convention date of August 4. The party's nominations were expected to depend on how many conservative southern Democrats walked out of the Democratic convention that year. The American Constitution Party of Oregon incorporated in 1974 in Hillsboro. It was affiliated with the National American Party, and it held a convention in Portland in 1976 to nominate Tom Anderson and Rufus Shackleford for the president and vice president, respectively, of the United STates. In 1996 Oregonian Herb Titus was the vice presidential nominee of the national Constitution Party, which was then known as the U.S. Taxpayers Party.History of the Constitution Party www.constitutionparty.com retrieved 2014/05/01 In 2000 the party was newly re-formed. Its nominee won 31% of the vote in a state legislative race where the Republican party did not nominate a candidate. By 2002, the party still had fewer than 1,000 registered voters. Also in 2002 party chairman Bob Eckstrom pledged support for Lon Mabon of the Oregon Citizens Alliance when the latter was jailed for contempt of court. In 2006 the Constitution nominee for Governor of Oregon was former TV anchor Mary Starrett, who ran on an anti-abortion platform.https://www.wweek.com/portland/article-5935-mary-starrett.html The state party also voted to disaffiliate with the national Constitution Party, due to differences over abortion policy.https://independentpoliticalreport.com/2013/09/constitution-party-of- oregon-officially-affiliates-with-independent-american-party/ It broke with the national party in May 2006. Similar measures were taken by other state parties after the national party partially abandoned their pro-life position on the issue of abortion, supporting it in the cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother. The amendment argued that \\"...until the national Constitution Party resumes a principled, pro-life position ‚Äì we, in Oregon, should separate ourselves and proceed as an independent state party.\\"Statement of Party Chair quoted on Third Party Watch As of July 31, 2016, the Oregon party has not re affiliated to the national Constitution Party. Starrett drew 3.6% of the vote; this was perceived to be primarily at the expense of Republican nominee Ron Saxton, though he lost by a margin greater than Starrett's share of the vote. http://www.katu.com/news/3636326.html There was an effort to draft Starrett to run for president of the United States in 2008. There was also speculation she might run for the U.S. Senate in 2008, but she did not ultimately seek either office. In 2008 the Constitution nominee for the U.S. Senate, Doug Brownlow, was expected to play a \\"spoiler\\" role in the contest between incumbent Gordon Smith and challenger Jeff Merkley. In that year, it also fielded candidates for the 4th Congressional District and the Oregon Attorney General, though the Oregon Republican Party sat those races out. Brownlow did ultimately draw more votes, 5.2%, than the margin between Smith and Merkley. Members of the Constitution Party protested funding of abortions by the Oregon Health Plan in 2009. In 2012 the Constitution Party of Oregon nominated Ron Paul for the U.S. presidency. Paul declined the nomination, because Oregon law would have prevented him from later being nominated by the Republican party had he accepted the nomination. In 2016, many members of minor political parties in the state re-registered for the Republican or Democratic parties in order to vote in the major parties' presidential primaries. The Constitution Party was the only party whose members went more strongly for the Republican party than the Democratic.

It was the best-selling Japanese PlayStation game of 1995 with over a million copies sold. The story begins as the young girl Kukuru goes to put out the Flame Cion. At the same time, the hero Arc begins his quest to search for his estranged father, who left him and his mother 10 years ago. The two meet after Kukuru has put out the flame and is attacked by monsters. Despite a heavy push for a North American release from RPG fans, the video game media, and third- party publishers, Arc the Lad was never formally released outside of Japan. However, years later it was included in the North American compilation Arc the Lad Collection. Gameplay Arc the Lad is a tactical RPG. In battle, the player has an area where each character may move, much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre. The areas the player can move are marked by blue tiles, and when using a melee attack on an enemy, the player can attack an enemy at any side the player can reach, and a cursor will be above the enemy to let the player know that he can attack the enemy. If the player uses magic or special abilities to attack the enemy, there will be a red set of tiles that show the player the range in which the spell or attack will reach. Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics, Arc the Lad is not isometric, therefore all tiles are the same size and shape. Outside of battle, the character must select given areas on a map to access them. For example, to reach a battlefield, dungeon, or castle, the player will be given a general world map, to which the player will select a continent, then a map of the continent will be displayed. The player then must select a highlighted area to enter it. The game will always prompt the player to save once the player has selected an area to go to. Virtually no towns can be selected in this game. Only dungeons, small areas, and fields may be selected. Once a player has selected an area, depending on the area chosen, the character may have the ability to explore the entire area. Many areas, however, do not allow for such freedom. Often the player will select an area and this may trigger an event, such as dialogue or battles. Because of this, most of the plot is given through dialogue during events as there are very few non-playable characters, or NPCs, to give information on where the player must go to. At the end of the game, the player can save after beating the final boss. This save data is actually cleared save game data that they can use to transport to a new game in Arc the Lad II. All their characters' stats and attributes and items will be transferred over to Arc the Lad II. Plot and setting =Story= The game begins with a girl named Kukuru who is a member of the Sacred Clan in Seirya („Çπ„É°„É™„Ç¢, Sumeria), a clan that protects the Flame Cion. She is sent by the mayor of her town to extinguish this flame, but once she does, a monster called an Ark Ghoul appears and Kukuru flees. Meanwhile, a boy named Arc prepares to look for his father Yoshua, who has been missing for ten years. He stumbles upon Kukuru and they both defeat the pursuing monsters. Arc makes a promise to Kukuru to re- ignite the flame for her, but he is quickly struck down by the powerful Ark Ghoul. As he lays defeated, Arc hears a voice call out to him. The voice is a Guardian, who revives Arc and tells him to re-ignite the flame. The Guardian also tells Arc that he will return here later to extinguish the flame so that he may retrieve the Ark, a mystical box that will aid him in protecting the world; the Guardian finally adds that Arc's father made an agreement with the Guardians of the planet to protect humanity by the fore-coming darkness. After hearing this, Arc re-ignites the fire and resealing the Ark Ghoul before it could kill Kukuru. Days later, after hearing of Arc's abilities, the king of Seirya summons him to Palencia Castle. As Arc heads to Palencia, Kukuru decides that it is her destiny to help him. Arc explains to the king that the guardian at the mountain had granted him power. In order to see if Arc truly is blessed by the guardians, the king's minister, Andel, insisted that they tests him. The two were sent to battle some monsters where the party meets Poco of the drum corps, who was the only survivor from their latest patrol. After Arc returns, the king tells him that he must seek out the Ark in order to save humankind. The king recounts how his own brother, the former king, believed this story and has disappeared to find the Ark. He then tells Arc to seek an audience with the Forest Spirit of Toyoke Forest in Millmana. Given a ride to Millmana on the king's airship, Arc meets with the current ruler, General Yagun. The arrogant general tells them the forest has become very dangerous and that he doesn't believe that \\"sniveling children\\" should be sent there. After passing Yagun's test (and trap) of strength, Arc and company seek out the Forest Spirit. The spirit tells them that Arc's father, the crown prince of Seirya, had seen her ten years ago and vowed to protect humankind, also that Arc will be the key to saving humankind and the world. The Forest Spirit gives Arc the hero's crest before departing, saying to Arc to return home to await word from his father. In Palencia, a warrior and former guard, Tosh, is being escorted to a prison for treason; Tosh tried to stop his fellow guards from slaughtering innocent people who were his clan. Arc prepares to report to the king regarding Millmana, but the king has grown ill. Tosh meanwhile breaks out of his cell and attacks some guards, who have transformed into monsters. Arc, Kukuru, and Poco help him, and after the battle, Tosh thanks them and leaves before more guards arrived. Arc returns to the king and with the hero's crest proves that the king's brother is Arc's father. Arc says that he must wait for correspondence from his father to seek out the rest of the Guardians, so the king tells him that he will help Arc in any way possible. They return to Arc's house in Touvil only to find that the town has been pillaged and ruined. A courier delivers a message from Arc's father, telling him to find the book in the Ancient Monolith, which will guide him to the Guardians and their Stones. At the Monolith, an old man named Gogen appears and reveals himself to be the \\"book\\" that Arc had been told to find. Gogen is an ancient wizard who had been imprisoned in the illusion world for over 3,000 years. He tells Arc that the first Guardian is in Alatos. The four go to the king for transportation to Alatos, and he gives them his airship, the Silver Noah. As the party heads to the Silver Noah, Tosh is mourning at his father's grave. Suddenly, Tosh's sword reveals its spirit and speaks to him. The spirit tells Tosh to accompany Arc on his quest. The Ark speaks to the party. In Alatos, the party meets a merchant named Chongara, who was instructed by Yoshua to guide them to the Guardian of Light. He wanted them to get him the Summon Pot in exchange for the information. After speaking with the Guardian of Light and getting the Light Stone, Gogen tells them the location of the next Guardian in Greyshinne. Before departing, Chongara boards the Silver Noah, telling Arc and company that he feels besieged to assist them in their quest. In Greyshinne, the party heads to Amaidar Temple („É©„Éû„Å†ÂØ∫, Ramada Temple). The Archmonk of the temple instructs the monk, Iga, to deal with Arc. The party pleads with Iga until Gogen suggests that he and Arc duel in order to gain permission to access the mountain. After Arc wins, Iga and the party speak with the Archmonk. Kukuru senses with her magic mirror that the Archmonk is a monster, which then causes the Archmonk to flee into the fighting grounds. Arc and team give chase and defeat the Archmonk. On Mt. Amaidar, the Earth Guardian gives them the Earth Stone. When they return to the temple, Iga asks them if he may help them in their quest. In Niedel, the party hears that a tournament is being held where the winner wins a Wind Orb. Believing this is related to the Wind Guardian, one member of the party enlists in the tournament. Once that person wins the tournament, the party discovers that the winners of each tournament are later killed by the organizers so that they can retain the Wind Orb. After defeating the crooked announcer, the party frees the Wind Guardian from the Wind Orb and received the Wind Stone. The Water Guardian lies in Zariban, a desert land once fertile but rendered arid by the over-processing of energy stones. The party meet a clansman of the Saryu Tribe who by Yoshua's request leads them to his village. The village was suddenly destroyed by an attack by Kasadoll, a general and ruler of Zariban. He is after the Water Guardian and destroyed the village as the Saryu Tribe are holding the key to entering the Water Shrine. They manage to defeat him and gain the Water Stone. From the stone, they've learned that the last guardian is in Seirya. When the group returns to Palencia, they find a police state run by Andel. Sneaking into the castle basement, they find the Fire Guardian held captive under Andel's command for energy experimentations. They free the Fire Guardian, who after much convincing, grants them the Fire Stone. However, a dying engineer set the basement and the castle above to self-destruct. They then find the king, who is dying as Andel flees. The king tells them that Andel was sent by Romalia to gain control of Seirya so he could retrieve the Ark for Romalia's plans of world conquest. After confessing his regrets to his nephew about having stolen the crown and throne from Yoshua, the king then dies, and the group escapes on the Silver Noah before the explosion brought out the whole castle. Andel branded Arc and friends as criminals for the king's death and the castle's destruction and puts a bounty on the party. They disguise themselves when returning to Seirya to extinguish the Flame Cion. Arc and Kukuru extinguish the flame. The Ark Ghoul reappears and flees to the Ark, and Arc and Kukuru chase after him. The other party members join them and head to Sabatico Falls. Inside Sabatico Falls, they find the Ark, which tests their power first by having them fight a doppelganger form of the party. After the Ark and the Guardians reveal that mankind's only saving grace will be their ability to love one another, Arc and Kukuru are given The Power of Bravery and Divine Power respectively. As the party leaves, Andel appears and seizes the Ark. Arc and his party were forced to be captured as Andel revealed that he's holding Arc's people captive, including his mother. The ground soon begins to split and the falls turns into the Sabatico Shrine as it emerges up high from the ground; the group use the quake to escape Andel's guards. Gogen tells them that the shrine has appeared as the seal against the Dark One, the world's entity of darkness, grows weaker. Arc tells Kukuru to go to the Sabatico Shrine, who now has the power to strengthen the seal as the last means of protection from the Dark One. The rest of the party return to the Silver Noah to set off and Kukuru watches them as they fly away to continue their mission of saving the world. =Setting= This game was intentionally designed to be short.This was mentioned in the Working Designs' \\"Making of Arc the Lad\\" CD that came with Arc the Lad Collection. Therefore, in the first game, only the continents of Seirya, Millmana, Alatos, Zariban, and Niedel are accessible. In Arc the Lad II, the towns of these areas, fields, dungeons, etc. are accessible. Also, new continents are accessible in Arc the Lad II. In terms of time, the game begins 10 years after Yoshua's departure, and some years after the opening sequence in Arc the Lad II, but before the actual storyline of Arc II. Music The orchestrated pieces were recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Most tracks in this game are sequenced as well, though the orchestrated pieces and the ending are streamed. Reception On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the PlayStation version of the game a 31 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: „Ç¢„Éº„ÇØ „Ç∂ „É©„ÉÉ„Éâ. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.342. Pg.32. 7 July 1995. A critic for Next Generation (a USA magazine reviewing the game as an import) gave it four out of five stars, applauding its \\"deeply-involved storyline\\", highly attractive graphics, attention to detail, \\"grand soundtrack which rivals any big-budget Hollywood production\\", and the overall sense of epic importance conveyed by the game's experience. Sales of Arc the Lad surpassed 400,000 units in Japan alone. Its budget re-release received a \\"Gold Prize\\" from Sony in May 1998, indicating sales above 500,000 units in Japan. North American release Despite the popularity of the game in Japan and considerable demand for a North American release, Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA) opted not to localize the game. Two different third-party publishers in the USA offered to translate and publish the game, but SCEA refused to license the game for a release in North America. This decision prompted a deluge of letters and emails calling for a North American release, and in early 1996 SCEA caved and announced that Arc the Lad would be released in North America in the fourth quarter of 1996. As the planned release date approached, insiders said the North American release would contain both Arc the Lad and Arc the Lad II, with an end-of-game save being used to unlock the second game. This release was later cancelled. However, a North American localization did eventually appear as part of Arc the Lad Collection in 2002. While the game remains mostly unchanged, the color during movie sequences was changed from 16-bit color to 24-bit color and DualShock vibration support was added. Other changes include Sumeria becoming Seirya, Ramada becoming Amaidar, and Alibarsha becoming Zariban.

Fr. Juan Carullo, a retired Army Chaplain and a native of Malinao, Albay. When he left the military service, his retirement pay and other personal wealth was invested in a school which he founded. At the beginning, the school was an exclusive high school for boys St. Agnes Academy (Legazpi City) was the exclusive high school for girls). In 1952, a strong typhoon hit Albay and badly damaged the Liceo de Albay. Around this time, the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) was looking for a place to put up a school in the province. Fr. Joseph Bates, SVD, negotiated with the Bishop of Albay for the SVD acquisition of the Liceo de Albay, amidst the school's financial difficulties. In 1959, the formal transfer of ownership and management was effected for around Php 30,000. Reconstruction of the school began with Fr. Bates' personal funds as well as money from his family and friends and from the United States of America. With the SVDs and Bates now in Legazpi City, many people from his old assignment in Bohol were brought to help him build and run the Liceo de Albay. When the Bicol Association of Catholic Schools (BACS) was formed, Bates was chosen as its chairman. Bates met Fr. Honesto Moraleda, who was then parish priest of St. Michael Parish in Oas, Albay through the activities of the BACS. He invited Moraleda become the first high school principal of the school with the permission of then Bishop Flaviano B. Ariola. Bates was the director. =1960s= Liceo de Albay became Divine Word High School in 1960. When the project of starting a school was decided by the SVDs, the pioneering spirit was its mission of spreading a Catholic Education and in so doing, provide opportunities to boys in this part of the region. The Liceo de Albay was facing financial difficulty due to dwindling enrolment. The physical state of the building which was purchased at a cost of Php 30,000.00 was not yet ready to admit an influx of new enrollees. In 1965, Divine Word High School became Divine Word College of Legazpi. Its formation was made possible with the combined efforts of Bishop Nestor C. Cari√±o, Msgr. Jose Molina, Msgr. Jose Diokno, Msgr. Ralph Salazar and Msgr. Honesto Moraleda. Its recognition as a high school was given by the Bureau of Private Schools. The school first director was Fr. Joseph L. Bates, SVD, while the first principal was Fr. Honesto A. Moraleda. The faculty members included Protacio Borlagdan, Ruperta Ungay (later Altabano), Lydia Platon and Jun Pe√±alosa, Antonio Laurora, Arnulfo Cabredo, Arles Navara, Miss Ongcoy, Trinidad Navea, Josaphat Clidoro. In 1965, the first college courses were opened with the following enrollment: *Commerce: 73 *BSE: 16 *BSEED: 92 *AB: 51 *Secretarial: 7 Total: 239 students In 1969, it produced its first batch of graduates in Commerce, Education, High School and Elementary. =1970s= In 1971, a tie-up with St. Gregory the Great Seminary was forged to enable the graduates from its Minor Seminary of Tabaco to pursue the college level. The AB Department, thus, offered A.B. Philosophy. In 1974, a two-year Accounting Aide and Salesmanship was offered followed by the Civil Engineering course in 1976. In 1978, the Graduate School opened with a Masters in Business Administration course. =1980s to 1990s= In 1981, the first batch of Civil Engineering graduates passed the Board Examination with a passing score of 91.6%. In 1983, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) Region V recognized the DWCL as the \\"Center for Commerce/Business Education.\\" By school year 1983-1984, computer subjects were integrated into the Commerce curriculum. By 1984, the DWCL produced its first topnotcher and 4th placers in the Junior Geodetic Engineering Board Exams. By SY 1984-1985, DWCL became the pilot center for \\"Associate in Commercial Science - Government Accounting and Auditing,\\" a three-year course. In 1985, it became a CPA Review Center. By 1987, the two Education courses, BEED and BSE, which were temporarily closed were re-opened. In 1988, the College again produced a first placer in Civil Engineering given by the PRC. In 1989, an award was bestowed by the DECS region V as \\"Center of Development of Commerce and Business Education.\\" By 1993, the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Computer Secretarial Courses were opened. In 1994, the Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA) was likewise opened. Due to the clamor for new offerings, in the second semester of school year 1995-1996, DWCL offered Masters in Public Management (MPM) and Master in Business Education (MBE). In 1997, the Commerce Department added Entrepreneurship as one of the majors for B.S. Commerce. In the same year, the Accountancy Department produced a 9th placer in the CPA Board Exam. By the end of 1999, DWCL had produced nine Board placers. Administration =Presidents= *Rev. Fr. Joseph L. Bates, SVD, 1916‚Äì1970 *Rev. Fr. Donald Malrenan, SVD, OIC, 1968‚Äì1969 *Rev. Fr.

Abbruzzi played collegiately for the University of Rhode Island (Class of 1955), and professionally for the Canadian Football League Montreal Alouettes for four years (1955‚Äì1959).  Early life and college career  Abbruzzi was born and raised in Warren, Rhode Island and is the younger brother of former NFL player, Lou \\"Duke\\" Abbruzzi. Abbruzzi attended Warren High School and went on to the University of Rhode Island following graduation. As a member of the University of Rhode Island Rams football team, from 1951 to 1954, he was an all star running back. He rushed 562 times for a school record 3389 yards (6 yard per carry average) and 25 touchdowns. His greatest and record setting day was October 4, 1952, versus New Hampshire (a 27-7 win). In this game, Abbruzzi rushed for 306 yards, including a 99-yard run from scrimmage, both school records. He also scored 3 TDs. He was named All-Yankee Conference each of these years and named a New England All-Star from 1952 to 1954.  Professional football career  Abbruzzi was drafted twice by the Baltimore Colts of the NFL in 1954 (30th round, 352 overall) and 1955 (13th round, 147 overall). Abbruzzi chose the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League for a pro career, mostly because they offered him a $500 bonus which he used for his honeymoon. In four years with the Alouettes, 1955 to 1958, he played 49 regular season games and 2 Grey Cup matches (against the Edmonton Eskimos.) He rushed 700 times for a total of 3749 yards (5.4 yard average) with 25 rushing TDs and eleven 100 yard rushing games. Abbruzzi's greatest year was his first in the CFL, 1955, when he was part of a dynamic Als team that contended for the 1955 Grey Cup. Abbruzzi rushed 182 times and led the CFL in rushing with 1,248 yards (6.9 yard average) and in touchdowns with 17 (his longest rush was 69 yards). Abbruzzi was named the second recipient of the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award, as well as a CFL All-Star, at the conclusion of the 1955 season. Abbruzzi continued as the Larks top rusher in 1956 with 1,062 yards and was named to a second consecutive CFL All-Star team in 1956. His 20 touchdowns that year stood alone as a CFL record until 1990 and was finally surpassed by Allen Pitts in 1994. In 1957, Abbruzzi had 809 yards, but an injury-plagued 1958 season would turn out to be his last, when Abbruzzi finished the year with 630 yards. In July 1959 he was traded to the Calgary Stampeders for Veryl Switzer during training camp but was released before the start of the 1959 regular season.  Teaching career and high school coaching career  After his professional career, Abbruzzi became a successful and much beloved Physical Education teacher and football coach at his alma mater, Warren High School in Warren, Rhode Island. He coached eight division champions over 26 years, and also coached baseball in his spare time. During the 1970s his football team set an interscholastic league record of 31 victories in a row. Known to all as \\"Doc\\", he was a legendary figure in Rhode Island high school football. Abbruzzi was named to the University of Rhode Island Athletic Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Rhode Island Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 1976. He was a charter member of the Warren Athletic Hall of Fame (1998) and in 2005 Pat was named to the Rhode Island Interscholastic League Hall of Fame. He was later elected to the Sons of Italy Athletic Hall of Fame.  Death  Pat Abbruzzi died on June 3, 1998.

KD Radio Incorporated (KD Radio) purchased KDSK-FM in January 2001. Having had much success with kdradio.com in California, it was decided to put the massive KD Radio oldies format of 7000 songs on the broadcast sister station, 50-year- old KMIN-AM (980 kHz). KDSK was a hot country station at this time. In April 2001 KMIN began streaming its Sound Souvenir's programming on the internet at kmin980.com. On June 14, 2004 KMIN's Sound Souvenir's format moved over to KDSK-FM. Due to the Sound Souvenir's strong showing in the ratings, number one in its market, management made the decision to move the format to the stronger KDSK-FM signal. This move was made after one week of simulcasting the Sound Souvenir's format on both KMIN-AM and KDSK-FM. KDSK-FM has had construction permits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 2005 to increase its Class from a C2 station to a C1 station by moving its broadcasting tower on the south side of Mt. Taylor 20 miles closer to Albuquerque, increasing the antenna height by 2,500 feet, and by increasing its effective radiated power from 26,000 watts to 45,000 watts. The station's usable signal previously has been limited in Albuquerque to neighborhoods of higher elevation. The upgrade would significantly increase KDSK's city grade signal level coverage in the Albuquerque radio market. However the station has moved to the site at 265 watts class C3 covering the local area. In Albuquerque KDSK has instead relied on its AM station for coverage including a feed to FM translator K229CL 93.7.

She was a National Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1983 to 1989, representing the electorate of Greenslopes. She served as Minister for Health in the government of Mike Ahern government from 1987 until her sacking in January 1989. She lost her seat at the election that December, and was not long out of parliament when she was charged with numerous counts of misappropriation of public funds concerning her usage of her official credit card. After a high-profile trial in 1990 and subsequent conviction, she spent five months in prison and a further seven months in home detention. Background Harvey was born in 1947 to displaced Polish parents in M√ºnsingen, West Germany. The family immigrated to Queensland when she was three, and she was raised in Brisbane thereafter, attending St Mary Immaculate Convent, Annerley, Buranda State School, St Ursula's College and Coorparoo State High School. She studied education at Griffith University and was a teacher in the special skills program at Springwood High School for most of her career. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Harvey eventually became a Pentecostal and joined Garden City Christian Church in Brisbane's southern suburbs. Harvey married in 1965 and had one son and one daughter, but divorced in 1975. She remarried in 1983.Waterson, D.B. (1993). Biographical register of the Queensland Parliament. Sydney: Casket. Harvey contested and won National preselection for the seat of Greenslopes at the 1983 election. On paper, it seemed unusual for the Nationals to contest a seat in the Brisbane suburbs, since they are traditionally an agrarian conservative party. However, the urban-rural divide is far less pronounced in Queensland than in other states. In a reverse of the situation both nationally and in most other states, the National Party had long been the senior party in the non-Labor Coalition, and had recently begun contesting seats in the Brisbane area. At the time, the seat was considered safe for the Liberal Party, the National Party's longtime junior coalition partner. However, the Liberals tore up the Coalition agreement in the summer of 1983. The Nationals poured resources into Liberal- held seats in an attempt to destroy their former partners. On election day, Harvey achieved a large swing, easily defeating incumbent Liberal and former minister Bill Hewitt and taking Greenslopes for the National Party for the first time in its history.\\"Queensland 2006: Greenslopes\\" . pollbludger.com. She actually pushed Hewitt into third place on the primary vote, and then defeated the Labor candidate on Liberal preferences. She was one of eight National MPs elected from greater Brisbane, enabling the Nationals to come within one seat of winning government in their own right. They picked up a majority when two Liberals crossed the floor. As a backbencher, Harvey's speeches reflected her strong support of small business (having spent a period in small business herself), the rights of the aged and the need for consumer protection. She was staunchly opposed to sex discrimination, but equally opposed to affirmative action. An ardent opponent of homosexuality, she often stated that homosexuality would \\"never be legalised in Queensland.\\"McCulloch, John. (1994). Women members of the Queensland Parliament 1929-1994. Brisbane: Qld Parliamentary Library. She faced a minor scandal before the 1986 election concerning use of her electorate printing allowances to aid her re-election, but was easily re-elected, and for a time was seen as something of a rising star in the party.Roberts, Greg. \\"Bold steps, but Premier avoids treading on too many toes\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 9 December 1987.McCulloch, John. (1994). Women members of the Qld Parliament 1929-1994. Brisbane: Qld Parliamentary Library. Health Minister In late 1987, amid mounting criticism from within the party, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Premier of Queensland for nearly twenty years, resigned, and was succeeded by the more moderate Mike Ahern. Ahern immediately instituted a ministerial reshuffle, removing the heavily criticized Yvonne Chapman, the state's first female Cabinet minister, but promoting Harvey to the high-profile position of Minister for Health. Harvey thus became the only woman in the Ahern Cabinet and the second woman in Queensland history to serve as a Cabinet minister.Roberts, Greg. \\"All change as Queensland government is reshaped\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 9 December 1987.McCulloch, John. (1994). Women members of the Queensland Parliament 1929-1994. Brisbane: Qld Parliamentary Library. Harvey's time as Health Minister, however, was plagued with difficulties from the beginning. She was forced to deal with a major health crisis which had sparked threats by hospital doctors to resign en masse, the Ward 10B scandal surrounding abuse of psychiatric patients at Townsville Hospital, and recurrent issues over the storage of toxic medical waste. She also came under attack for appointing her daughter and sister-in-law to her paid staff, as well as a woman previously convicted on fraud charges, and using government funds to pay her hairdressing bills, leading the opposition to dub her \\"Minister for Goldilocks\\".Roberts, Greg. \\"Harvey warns of poll after sacking\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 20 January 1989.McCulloch, John. (1994). Women members of the Queensland Parliament 1929-1994. Brisbane: Qld Parliamentary Library. She had a difficult relationship with many in the medical profession; David Lindsay, former head of medicine at the Gold Coast Hospital, recounted in 2005 that Harvey \\"treated us like schoolchildren\\" and \\"told us about how precious her time was and how we were wasting her time\\".Gleeson, Peter. \\"Physician: Crisis is chronic\\". The Gold Coast Bulletin, 4 August 2005. Harvey's caucus colleague Di McCauley, herself later a minister, remarked in her 2004 memoir Diving Off The Ironing Board that Harvey \\"seemed unable to cope from the beginning in what was the enormous and difficult portfolio of Health.\\"Koch, Tony. \\"Former minister irons out old colleagues in tell-all memoir\\". The Courier-Mail, 12 March 2004. One of Harvey's major tasks as Health Minister was to deal with the government's response to the growing AIDS crisis. The issue had been essentially ignored under Bjelke-Petersen, but under the more moderate Ahern, Harvey was tasked with taking steps to begin to address the disease. To this extent, she oversaw the legalisation of condom vending machines and needle exchanges, and instituted a program of AIDS education in schools.Roberts, Greg. \\"Queensland set to reform its AIDS strategy\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 2 January 1988. These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community.McCulloch, John. (1994). Women members of the Queensland Parliament 1929-1994. Brisbane: Qld Parliamentary Library. These issues came to a head in March 1988 when Harvey put out a departmental memo insisting that she be given unrestricted access to the medical records of AIDS patients, sparking a bitter battle over patient confidentiality, and repeated Opposition calls for her to be removed from the portfolio.Roberts, Greg. \\"AIDS experts to defy memo\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 26 March 1988.Roberts, Greg. \\"Calls for end to Queensland crackdown on gays\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 28 March 1988. Downfall Rumors had been mounting throughout late 1988 that Harvey was likely to be either demoted or fired, and in January 1989, Ahern announced that Harvey would be demoted to the position of Minister for Family Services, ostensibly on the basis of having failed to seek his approval for employing a woman who had previously been jailed for fraud. An angry Harvey responded by threatening to resign and force a by-election. The government's poll numbers were in free fall by this time; by all accounts the Nationals would have almost certainly lost Greenslopes had Harvey resigned. This was not taken well by many of her National Party colleagues, and after an internal outcry, Ahern retracted his prior decision and sacked her from Cabinet altogether before she could be sworn in.\\"Harvey departs Queensland Cabinet\\". Australian Financial Review, 20 January 1989. Though she did not resign from parliament as previously threatened, she became an ardent backbench opponent of Ahern, and strongly supported his more conservative rival, Russell Cooper, who toppled Ahern in a party-room coup later that year.\\"Premier's days look numbered\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 29 August 1989. In the 1989 state election, the Nationals were swept from power in a massive Labor landslide. Harvey herself was resoundingly defeated by Labor challenger Gary Fenlon, suffering a 30% swing and finishing third behind both the Labor and Liberal candidates with only 11% of the vote.Roberts, Greg. \\"Courthouse packed for former ministers\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 13 December 1989. Three days later, as part of an investigation resulting from the findings of the Fitzgerald Inquiry into public corruption, she was one of five former National Party ministers to receive criminal summons by special prosecutor Doug Drummond, QC, on charges of misappropriating public funds.Roberts, Greg. \\"Former ministers to face charges\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 6 December 1989. The charges concerned her use of her official credit card for A$42,364 in personal expenses, some of which it was alleged included taking her husband on a birthday trip to the Adelaide Grand Prix.Massey, Murray. \\"Yet another cause of embarrassment for Queensland Nationals\\". Australian Financial Review, 13 December 1989.Massey, Murray. \\"Four ex-ministers of the Crown come down to earth with a thud\\". Australian Financial Review, 13 December 1989. She was subsequently convicted of misappropriation on 13 of the original 124 charges, concerning a total of $7,900, and sentenced to twelve months in prison in November 1990. The Court of Criminal Appeal later reduced the convictions to nine counts but did not reduce the sentence. In April 1991, the judge struck down a further 20 charges and released Harvey to serve the last seven months of her sentence in home detention.\\"Key figures from the Fitzgerald Inquiry.\\" Australian Associated Press, 2 July 1999.

The unusually high concentration of a rare metal like iridium is often taken as evidence for an extraterrestrial impact event. Anomaly characteristics The type locality of this iridium anomaly is near Raton, New Mexico. Iridium is a very rare element in the Earth's crust, but is found in anomalously high concentrations (around 100 times greater than normal) in a thin worldwide layer of clay marking the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, 66 million years ago. This boundary is marked by a major extinction event, including that of the dinosaurs along with about 70% of all other species. The clay layer also contains small grains of shocked quartz and, in some places, small weathered glass beads thought to be tektites. Meteorite impact theory A team consisting of the physicist Luis Alvarez, his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Vaughn Michel were the first to link the extinction to an extraterrestrial impact event based on the observation that iridium is much more abundant in meteorites than it is on Earth. This theory was later substantiated by other evidence, including the eventual discovery of the impact crater, known as Chicxulub, on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.

Early life Whitfield was born in New York City and was the son of Emily Harrison (Thorp) Whitfield and Henry Davis Whitfield. His father was the brother of Louise Whitfield Carnegie, the wife of Andrew Carnegie. Whitfield was a graduate of Princeton University and worked as a business executive. An amateur pilot, Whitfield owned a small red and silver Taylor Cub airplane which he occasionally flew (mostly for recreation). At the time of his disappearance, he had accumulated 200 hours of flying experience. Disappearance Whitfield departed Roosevelt Field in Mineola in his small silver and red Taylor Cub monoplane, which he planned to land at an airfield in Brentwood, New York (approximately away). He was only supposed to be in the air for fifteen minutes, but he never arrived as scheduled. One source reported that Whitfield's plane had been flying steadily‚Äîbut then Whitfield \\"nosed his plane into a mild easterly wind, [and] disappeared from sight.\\" His plane had enough fuel for a 150-mile flight. Neither Whitfield nor his plane has ever been recovered. An investigation discovered that on the day he vanished he had checked into a hotel in Garden City on Long Island under an alias he occasionally employed: \\"Albert C. White.\\" Hotel records indicated that Whitfield/White had paid $4 in advance for the room and never checked out. When the hotel room was searched, it was discovered that his personal belongings (including his passport), clothing, cuff links engraved with his initials, two life insurance policies (in his name listing his wife, Elizabeth Halsey Whitfield, as the beneficiary), and several stock and bond certificates made out in Andrew's and Elizabeth's names, were all left behind in the hotel room. Phone records also indicated that he had called his home while his family was out looking for him, and a telephone operator reported that she heard him say over the phone, \\"Well, I am going to carry out my plan.\\" Police concluded that Whitfield had committed suicide by deliberately flying his plane into the Atlantic Ocean despite there being no evidence to substantiate this theory. Although a thorough search of the coastal areas surrounding Long Island was conducted, no plane wreckage was ever discovered. There was no evidence that at the time of Whitfield's disappearance he was having any personal or business problems. Whitfield had married the former Elizabeth Halsey earlier that year and had been planning to move to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (with his new wife) the same month that he disappeared.

His genre scenes were influenced by the work of the Flemish and Dutch genre artists referred to as the Bamboccianti active in Rome who created small cabinet paintings and prints of the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside. One of the leading battle painters active in Italy in the first half of the 17th century, Michelangelo Cerquozzi earned the nickname 'Michelangelo delle Battaglie' ('Michelangelo of the Battles').David A.

Web. 6 July 2016 Life Michelangelo Cerquozzi was born in Rome as the son of Marcello Cerquozzi and Lucia Vassalli, both Roman citizens. His father was a successful leather merchant and the family was well-off. Michelangelo Cerquozzi started his artistic training at the age of 12 in the studio of Giuseppe Cesari, a history painter in whose studio the young Caravaggio trained upon his arrival in Rome.Giuseppe Scavizzi, Michelangelo Cerquozzi, detto Michelangelo delle Battaglie at Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 23 (1979) Soldiers Playing Dice Various biographers and scholars describe Cerquozzi as an artist in close contact with the circle of Flemish and Dutch artists active in Rome. They place him in the period 1620-1621 as living or working in Rome alongside Jacob de Hase (also known as Giacomo Fiammingo), an Antwerp painter of battles who came to Rome in 1601.Laura Bartoni, Le vie degli artisti : residenze e botteghe nella Roma barocca dai registri di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, 1650-1699, Edizioni Nuova cultura, Rome, 2012, page 412-413 He may have studied with Jacob de Hase before this date. In 1624 he lived with the Dutch painters Paulus Bor originally from Amersfoort and Jan Harmansz originally from Reims, and during 1625-1630 with the Fleming Willem Michiels. By 1631, he had a studio with his pupil Matteo Bonicelli and Michiels. The work from his early period is not well-known. He painted some battle paintings and also produced still life paintings which imitated the work of Pietro Paolo Bonzi, a still life specialist. Cerquozzi joined the Accademia di San Luca in 1634 and attended their meetings until 1652. However, he never followed their strict decorum.Michelangelo Cerquozzi at Hadrianus Cerquozzi gradually gained recognition starting from 1630 and his works sold very well to all classes of patrons. The early sponsorship of purchasers such as the merchant Dominico Viola played an important role in launching his career. He was also able to secure commissions from prominent patrons including professionals such as the lawyer Raffaelo Marchesi and the doctor Vincenzo Neri and aristocratic clients from the circle of the Barberini family, the Colonna family, Cardinal Rapaccioli, Modenese Count Camillo Carandini, count Carpegna and Monsignor Raggi. Many of his patrons were from circles that supported the Spanish cause in Italy. Cerquozzi would also collaborate on designs of Famiano Strada's De Bello Belgico celebrating Alessandro Farnese's campaigns to recapture the Spanish Netherlands for the Spanish emperor. The trough His friends included Pietro da Cortona, Giacinto Brandi, and Cornelis Bloemaert. Among his pupils were Matteo Bonicelli and Giovanni Francesco Gerardi. Cerquozzi never married and remained childless. When he died on 29 March 1660 in Rome in his house located near the Spanish Steps he had become a very wealthy artist with important financial and property holdings.Loredana Lorizzo, Un nuovo inventario dei beni di Michelangelo Cerquozzi stimato da Mario de' fiori, in RIVISTA D'ARTE, Vol. I, serie quinta, 2011, pp. 283-311 Work =General= Michelangelo Cerquozzi is best known for painting small canvases depicting genre scenes and his lively Baroque battle scenes. Cerquozzi was recognised as a prominent still life painter, while his multi-faceted career also included religious and mythological compositions.Michelangelo Cerquozzi, called Michelangelo delle Battaglie (Rome 1602 - 1660), The Rehearsal, or A Scene from the Commedia dell'Arte at Galerie Canesso Cerquozzi executed only one public commission in Rome, a lunette depicting the Miracle of Saint Francis of Paolo in the cloister of the Church of Sant‚ÄôAndrea delle Fratte, which has been lost. He is said to have painted altarpieces for several unidentified Sardinian churches.Alessandro Zuccari, Michelangelo Cerquozzi, nicknamed Michelangelo delle battaglie at Banca d'Italia Cerquozzi‚Äôs religious works are generally cabinet-sized pictures and feature, like his genre paintings, small, unidealized figures in naturalistic landscape settings. His mythological canvases, for example Hercules and Herminia and the Shepherds are grounded in a peasant world. He also painted some allegorical paintings, including personifications of the seasons, such as Summer and Spring (both in the Ashmolean Museum). =Battle paintings= Battle scene Michelangelo Cerquozzi earned the nickname 'Michelangelo delle Battaglie' for his battle pieces. In his battle pieces, he adapted the Bamboccianti style to the genre. Cerquozzi utilised an immediate, almost brutal language and pushed battle painting toward a representation of the naked facts. Some of his battle pieces were influenced by scenes of Salvator Rosa, such as the \\"Battle\\" in the Galleria Nazionale of Rome. He made significant contributions to the genre in his small canvases. These feature a close-up viewpoint of a battle dominated by an intense cavalry conflict, complete with horses and men unbridled in whirling movement. These works influenced and anticipated Jacques Courtois' (Borgognone) achievements in the battle genre.Marco Chiarini, The Thirty Years' War and its Influence on Battle Painting in Italy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries at the Westf√§lisches Landesmuseum f√ºr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte =Genre scenes= In his genre scenes Cerquozzi shows his indebtedness to the Bamboccianti, the circle of Dutch and Flemish painters around Pieter van Laer and Jan Miel who had developed a new style in Rome rooted in Northern traditions of genre painting. A painting in this style was known as a Bambocciata (plural: Bambocciate). The important contribution of the Bamboccianti was the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \\"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\\"David A. Levine (December 1988). The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti. The Art Bulletin (College Art Association) 70 (4): 569‚Äì589 Party in a garden with Roman artists In his early genre works Cerquozzi showed his mastery of the style of Pieter van Laer and Jan Miel in their compact scale, anti-heroic subject-matter and dramatic chiaroscuro effects. In these works Cerquozzi explored the humble life of the Roman people, among its ruins, in its taverns and their quarrels. He often set the scenes in Rome and the surrounding Campagna. Cerquozzi was not a slavish follower of these Flemish and Dutch models and differed from them in his emphasis on contemporary narrative and anecdotal elements. He also introduced figures of higher social standing, a tendency also present in Jan Miel's work during the 1640s and 1650s.Ludovica Trezzani. \\"Miel, Jan.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 July 2016 Cerquozzi's Party in a garden with Roman artists (Kassel, Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister) displays typical bambocciata characteristics in its naturalism and small format. However, rather than the usual low-life figures it depicts groups of finely dressed men and women. These include the artist himself, his doctor Vincenzo Neri and other friends engaged in conversation and games. The traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by the Bamboccianti offered a realist \\"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists. An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. Still life with pumpkin, grapes and pears While his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, acceptance of the Bamboccianti in the Accademia di San Luca, the prestigious association of leading artists in Rome was not impossible. This is demonstrated by the fact that Cerquozzi and van Laer were associated with both. Cerquozzi was even admitted to the Accademia in 1634 when he was only 30 years old. The dislike of other artists for the Bamboccianti has been explained by the fact that they produced paintings which were often cheaper and thus constituted strong competition for 'serious' painters, particularly at the end of the 1640s and during the 1650s when the economy was depressed. Contrary to what these other artists believed, the most successful Bamboccianti such as Cerquozzi were in fact able to command high prices for their works. =Still life paintings= Cerquozzi painted still life paintings throughout his career. His early still life paintings imitated the work of Pietro Paolo Bonzi, a still life specialist. These painting were still lifes of fruits that strived for realism and showed the influence of Caravaggio. He started to compose large still life painting which included with life-size figures. Youths picking fruit Examples of his still life paintings are the Youths picking fruit (640-1645, Prado Museum) and the Harvest of pomegranates (after 1640, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), which both depict a young man and a young woman in an orchard with the man offering the sitting woman a piece of fruit. A still life of fruit is in front of the figures. The figures show clearly the influence of the Caravaggesque naturalism. The somewhat contorted expression of the young man, his naked torso and the open white shirt bring to mind the memory of certain early works of Caravaggio. The superb rendering of the vine leaves and grapes in the Prado piece evoke Caravaggio's Basket of fruit in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. However, the opulence of the pumpkins, the open pomegranate and the presence of a landscape barely visible in the background point to a more advanced phase in the evolution of the genre and show full Baroque influences.Michelangelo Cerquozzi, Ni√±os cogiendo fruta, at the Prado Museum The Baroque freedom of vision and \\"plein air\\" setting of these compositions show Cerquozzi to be a mediator from Caravaggio to the \\"Baroque\\". The theme of the plucking of fruit and offering it to a young woman was already common in the Low Countries in the 16th century. In the Harvest of pomegranates in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, the young man offers a pomegranate to the young women. The pomegranate was for centuries a symbol of fertility and abundance, undoubtedly because of the many seeds it contains. The erotic meaning of the composition is indicated by the fact that the fruit offered is about to burst and by the loving glance that the woman casts towards the man.Michelangelo Cerquozzi, Harvest of pomegranates at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen He achieved considerable success with his still lifes, which appear frequently in 17th and 18th century inventories. Revolt of Masaniello =Collaborations= He was a frequent collaborator with various landscape and architectural painters. These included collaborations with the architectural painters Viviano Codazzi (starting from the 1630s) and the landscape painter Angeluccio. Cerquozzi and Codazzi became frequent collaborators. As Codazzi's compositions typically depicted Antique ruins and monuments, the collaboration likely made Cerquozzi move away from the representation of anecdotes of rural life to more elevated and exotic subjects. In 1657 the two artists collaborated on various canvases for Cardinal Flavio Chigi, one of the most important art patrons of his time. Some of the canvases made for Cardinal Chigi treated original subject matter. For instance, a composition entitled Women's bath represents a fantastic Renaissance interior in which numerous naked women are shown in sunken pools, possibly a surprising subject for a commission by a Cardinal. Blind Man's Bluff, with Angeluccio Cerquozzi collaborated with Viviano Codazzi in 1648 on a canvas depicting the Revolt of Masaniello. The Revolt of Masaniello at the Borghese Gallery This work deals with the anti-Spanish rebellion that took place on 7 July 1647 in the Piazza del Mercato in Naples with the support of France. Cerquozzi framed and objectified his observations on the event in a wide scenic and challenging perspective. He brilliantly used the naturalistic bambocciata manner to produce a comic‚Äìheroic portrayal of the revolt. He depicted a lively historical fresco in miniature, in which the town square, angry populace, petty thieves and animals are all enclosed by the wide view of the city which opens onto the Vesuvius. The various events which happened during the rebellion are depicted in this single composition. The leader of the rebellion appears on a horse in the centre front of the painting.Wendy Wassyng Roworth, The Evolution of History Painting: Masaniello's Revolt and Other Disasters in Seventeenth-Century Naples, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 75, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), pp. 219-234 Unlike the contemporary treatment of the same subject by Domenico Gargiulo who treats Masaniello twice in a single canvas as a primitive saint, Cerquozzi treated the anti-Spanish revolt, which was a very important event in Europe's balance of power, in a rather even-handed and objective manner even though he was generally regarded as being pro-Spanish. The piece had in fact been commissioned by Bernardino Spada, a pro-French cardinal. Cerquozzi, a painter of genre and battle scenes, may have been a logical choice for the cardinal. The historic rebellion was still regarded as 'news' at the time he commissioned the painting. Masaniello is represented not so much as a hero, or even a comic anti-hero, whether pro- or anti-Spanish, but as a kind of prodigy who rose above the ordinary fate of his class to accomplish fabulous deeds. Cerquozzi's composition can thus be regarded as falling in the genre of painted marvels, which travellers brought back from the East or the New World to document rarities of nature or peculiarities of human behaviour for the interest of European collectors. Masaniello, the fisherman who had become king, was similarly an aberration in the normal course of human events, and thus deserved such a representation. Colosseum and Arch of Constantine, with Viviano Codazzi In 1647, Cerquozzi collaborated with Jan Miel, Giacomo Borgognone, and others on illustrations for he second volume of Famiano Strada's De Bello Belgico, which celebrated the campaigns waged by Alessandro Farnese in the Netherlands for the Spanish emperor.Famiano Strada, De Bello Belgico at Worldcat Notes External links * Category:1602 births Category:1660 deaths Category:Artists from Rome Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Italian Baroque painters ","title":"Michelangelo Cerquozzi"},{"id":"8010254","text":"Thom Racina is an American television writer and novelist.

Founding members included Isaac Bangani Tabata, Dora Taylor, Ralph Lee and Isaac Blank (later known as Ted Grant). Its first initiative was to intervene in the All African Convention, called to oppose the Hertzog Bills, which aimed to complete the implementation of apartheid in the nation. The group opposed both the system of apartheid and calls for black nationalism. The group founded the Non-European Unity Movement (NEUM), in which Tabata would play a central role for many years, while Goolam Gool represented the group on the similar but Communist Party of South Africa-led National Liberation League. In 1939, facing increasing repression, the group went underground and began working solely through the NEUM. As a result, when the government banned groups based on the teachings of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky in 1950, its activities were unaffected. Some sources claim that the WPSA ceased to exist in 1953, although due to its secretive nature, this is difficult to confirm.

It is located near the village of Mandakalli, south of the city, and is owned and operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). As of October 2019, the airport has regular daily flights to Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Goa. The airport's history dates to the 1940s, when it was constructed by the Kingdom of Mysore. Passenger service, training flights of the Indian Air Force, and other operations took place at Mysore Airport during its first several decades. Entrance to departures area Close view of the terminal History In 1940, the Princely State of Mysore established the airport on of land. Following Indian independence in 1947, the Government of Karnataka assumed control of the airfield. The Ministry of Civil Aviation took control in 1950. Passenger service to Bangalore using Dakota aircraft began, but it did not last long as people found travel by road to be faster. Thereafter, The Hindu started daily flights from Chennai via Bangalore to deliver its newspapers. However, these flights lasted only a few months. Afterward, the airfield was used by charter flights carrying foreign tourists and by flights transporting dignitaries to the city, such as Jawaharlal Nehru. The Indian Air Force operated training flights at the airport as well. In 1985, regional airline Vayudoot commenced thrice weekly flights from Bangalore using its Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The service was inaugurated by famous Indian writer R. K. Narayan. At the time, Mysore Airport consisted solely of a grass airstrip and a one-roomed terminal with one toilet. Because of low passenger loads, the flights ended in 1990. Infrastructure Mysore Airport has a single runway, 09/27, with dimensions and the ability to service ATR 72 turboprop and similar aircraft. The apron has three parking stands and is connected to the runway by a single perpendicular taxiway. Mysore Airport's passenger terminal occupies and can hold a maximum of 150 passengers. Airlines and destinations Future plans Under the second phase of expansion, the runway would be lengthened to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. The runway cannot be extended to the west because of the presence of a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to hold off on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the highway was justified. Proposal for second phase was submitted by the State government of Karnataka for extension of runway. It proposed tunneling NH 766 beneath the runway, which requires less land than deviating the highway; but the Central Government rejected this proposal, citing security concerns. In August 2016, however, the Deccan Chronicle reported that the Ministry of Civil Aviation had directed airport officials to have a study conducted regarding tunneling of the highway. On 17 May 2018, central government gave permission to the above proposal and as per the plan the existing runway would be expanded to 2750 metres.

Because of its location in the suburbs of Sambra, east of Belgaum, the airport is also known as the Sambra airport. The new terminal building was inaugurated by Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on 14 September 2017. Near the airport, there is an Indian Air Force station at which new recruits receive basic training. History Built in 1942 by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Belgaum Airport is the oldest airport in Karnataka. The RAF used the airport as a training site during World War II, providing support to the South East Asia Command. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) took control of the airport in 1956, followed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in 1962. During the 1990s, Belgaum Airport was served by East-West Airlines, Gujarat Airways, Indian Airlines, NEPC Airlines and Vayudoot. All airlines ended flights to the airport by the end of the decade. Belgaum Airport saw the return of commercial flights in 2003, with Air Deccan providing service from Bangalore. Air Deccan also flew to Kolhapur and Mumbai for some time. After Air Deccan completed its merger with Kingfisher Airlines in 2008, Kingfisher decided to end flights to Belgaum in June 2009. Nevertheless, expansion plans for Belgaum Airport were launched in 2010, when the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Government of Karnataka signed a memorandum of understanding. Kingfisher returned in January 2011 with daily flights from Mumbai, but it exited the market in November 2011 amid its own financial difficulties.

This was a thrice a week flight operated by ATR 72 type aircraft. Air India began service to Bangalore with its Airbus A319 aircraft from 10 August 2018 on remaining 4 days of the week thus connecting Belgaum with Bangalore all 7 days in the week. Also this was the first arrival of Airbus A319 in Belgaum. In 2013, the Central Government cleared the expansion project. Work began in February 2015 at a cost of Rs 1.20 billion and took over two and a half years. It involved extension of the runway, construction of a new isolation bay, taxiway, apron for three A-320 aircraft and a new 22.5-metre tall ATC tower. The expanded facilities were formally inaugurated on 14 September 2017 and AAI commissioned the new terminal and apron on 16 October 2017. In 2020, Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi requested that the airport be named after Kittur Rani Chennamma. Terminal and airfield A new terminal building was inaugurated on 14 September 2017 as part of the airport expansion project. The terminal building is spread over 3,600 square metres and has a capacity to accommodate over 300 passengers. It has two baggage conveyor belts and six check-in counters. It has an apron for parking of three Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft. The old apron has two parking stands designed for the ATR 72 and similar aircraft. There are also two additional aprons, one on the north side of the runway that serves as an isolation bay and one on the south side. These aprons are each connected by single taxiways to runway 08/26, which measures . A extension of the runway has been completed & presently runway size is 2300√ó45 metres.

Retrieved September 7, 2016. History =Early history= An earlier symphony orchestra, organized by music educator W. S. Mason and others, served Charleston as early as the 1920s and perhaps before. Under the direction of William R. Wiant, the Charleston Civic Orchestra gathered 55 musicians for their first rehearsal on September 19, 1939. The first concert was performed at the Charleston Municipal Auditorium on November 14, 1939. The orchestra was officially incorporated on May 29, 1940,\\"West Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Inc\\". West Virginia Secretary of State. Retrieved September 7, 2016. and an Executive Board and Women's Committee were formed to support its efforts. When conductor William R. Wiant left Charleston for military service in the fall of 1942, Antonio Modarelli, conductor of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, was called upon to become the new conductor. Prior to coming to Wheeling in 1937, Modarelli had led the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for seven years. Modarelli retained this dual conductorship for five years before moving to Charleston on a full-time basis. Then, in 1943, the orchestra's name was changed to Charleston Symphony Orchestra. To attract musicians during the war years the orchestra entered into an innovative alliance with the local chemical industry, which agreed to recruit and hire chemical engineers and chemists who were also symphonic musicians. This successful partnership garnered national attention. The orchestra‚Äôs first manager, Helen Thompson, a second violinist in the orchestra, was active in the founding of the American Symphony Orchestra League, the professional service organization for orchestras in the United States. Thompson, became its first full-time executive secretary in 1950, and maintained the league‚Äôs office in Charleston for 12 years. Composer George Crumb's parents, George(clarinet) and Vivian(cello), were members of the Charleston Symphony Orchestra. Crumb's composition \\"Poem\\" was performed by the CSO in 1947. Crumb was 18 years old. \\"Gethsemane\\" was performed in 1952. =1950s and 1960s= Following Modarelli's death, Geoffrey Hobday led the orchestra from 1954 to 1963. His conductorship was marked by an award from the Alice M. Ditson Fund of Columbia University that funded a guest appearance by composer Stanley Wolfe conducting his Third Symphony. Donald Voorhees, conductor of television's Bell Telephone Hour, also appeared as guest conductor. Hobday was succeeded by Charles Gabor, whose tenure lasted only one season (1964‚Äì65), but his Young People's Concerts would become a long-lasting tradition. In 1965, Charles Gabor was replaced by Charles Schiff. Under Schiff, the orchestra became more cosmopolitan in scope, booking nationally recognized guest artists on a regular basis and presenting more challenging orchestral works than in the past. An expansion of the children's concerts eventually led to the first set of quadruple Young People's Concerts being performed in 1968, a tradition first introduced by Charles Gabor, which continues to this day. =1970s and 1980s= Charles Schiff left in 1977, and Ron Dishinger was hired. Dishinger continued the development of the orchestra's education program through an expanded Student Enrichment Program in the elementary schools. Dishinger served as conductor until 1979. Sidney Rothstein became Music Director in 1980 and began a period of artistic growth that continued throughout the 1980s. In his first season, Rothstein greatly expanded the orchestra's schedule and performed the first Super Pops concert at the Charleston Civic Center. The following season he formed the orchestra's first resident string quartet and presented the first \\"Symphony Sunday,\\" an outdoor festival marking the end of the season. With the appointment of Thomas Conlin as Artistic Director & Conductor in 1984, a new era began for the Charleston Symphony Orchestra. The season expanded in size to 8, then 9, then eventually to 12 concerts including pops. Touring and run-out concerts around the state were also greatly increased, and a second home in Parkersburg was established, through a new organization, the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra - Parkersburg. In recognition of its new status as a true regional organization, in 1988, the name of the orchestra was changed to the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra. =1990s and 2000s= The newly named West Virginia Symphony Orchestra celebrated its 50th Anniversary during the 1989‚Äì1990 season. The highlight of the year-long observances was a five- concert tour culminating in a performance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. on October 29, 1989 . Included in the program was a new piano concerto by composer Tomas Svoboda commissioned by the orchestra in celebration of the occasion. In December 1999, Thomas Conlin announced his intention to step down from the WVSO podium in 2001, concluding an extraordinary 17-year tenure. After an extensive search process that attracted almost 200 applications from around the world, the WVSO named Grant Cooper, a New Zealand native, as Artistic Director & Conductor of the WVSO in March 2001. Upon the selection of Cooper, Thomas Conlin accepted the title of Conductor Laureate, in recognition of his extensive accomplishments with the WVSO. In September 2015, Grant Cooper announced that he will step down as Artistic Director & Conductor at the end of the 2016-17 season.

The airport will be built by the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (KSIIDC) at a cost of Rs 220 crore. The project site is located 15 km from the city on of land in Buranapura and Madhubavi villages. The airport is expected to be ready by early 2022. History In March 2007, the State government Cabinet approved construction of greenfield airports in Bijapur, Gulbarga and Shimoga to give a boost to the tourism industry. Nineteen companies had responded when the Government called for an Expression of Interest (EoI) in 2007 to develop the airports.Minor Airports Infrastructure Development Department, Government of Karnataka In January 2010, the Karnataka government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with infrastructure development company MARG Limited for developing a green field airport at Bijapur under a public-private partnership agreement to cater to ATR 72 aircraft. The airside development was to include a 2,500 square metre terminal building, a 1,700 m long runway, aprons, taxiways, hangars, isolated parking bay, a 15 m air traffic control tower, ground support equipment, fuel storage facilities and a fire station. The project came to a halt in 2012, when MARG demanded an additional 1,000 acres of land to build commercial complexes near the airport to make the project economically viable. According to the government, this amounted to a breach of contract signed through the MoU. In 2013, the Government decided to abandon the PPP model and instead sought to partner with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to complete the project. AAI agreed to build Bijapur airport but sought Rs. 50 crore from the State government to start site levelling work, but the State government failed to reply. In February 2019, the KSIIDC sought to develop a ‚Äòno-frills airport‚Äô at the site to boost tourism and business activities. On 9th July 2020, the state cabinet gave approval for the project to be completed by the State Public Works Department. The first Phase would cost Rs 95 crore and was given a deadline of 18 months. The first phase of development includes a 1900 metre runway, along with the associated taxiways and apron. A terminal building to handle 200 passengers during peak hours will also be built to handle ATR 72 type aircraft. The second phase, costing Rs 125 crore, will be implemented after operations commence. The airport would be expanded to handle larger aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 based on demand.

Sims and first published by Optimus Design Systems in 1996. History Optimus Design Systems (ODS) published the Blood Dawn RPG as a 240-page softcover book in 1996. Three years later, ODS sold the Blood Dawn license to SSDC, Inc.. Gameplay This cyberpunk roleplaying game is set in a post-apocalyptic alternate 21st century timeline on Earth. Characters can play \\"normal\\" humans or mutants. Character creation uses a \\"point buy\\" system: players must distribute 130 ability points between Strength, Manual Dexterity, IQ, Agility, Constitution, Guts, Intuition and Charisma. The player then spends 2000 skill points on skills such as animal husbandry or weather prediction. (If the character is a mage, the player must spend at least 750 of these skill points on spells.) Any leftover skill points can be spent on armor, weapons and equipment. Action resolution compares the difficulty rating of a task with the character's relevant ability. The player must roll a 20-sided dice below the difference between ability and difficulty. Magic uses a point-spend system: mages can cast spells by spending points from a renewable pool, with greater spells requiring more points. Once the mage is out of spell points, the mage must wait until spell points renew in order to cast more spells. Reception In the July 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue 237), Rick Swan thought that Blood Dawn was \\"ambitious but unfocused, lurching between cynicism and whimsy... But though Blood Dawn is kind of a mess, it‚Äôs a fascinating mess, rife with possibility for players willing to sift the gems from the junk.\\" Swan found the character creation system a snap; he was also intrigued by the available pregenerated characters. He found the action resolution system quite simple, and also liked the flexibility of the magic system. But he found the combat system \\"burdened with a host of variables and nitpicky calculations... All this clutter, I guess, is supposed to enhance realism. But it just made me reach for the aspirin.\\" Swan also criticized the game setting, calling it \\"your standard Kentucky Fried Earth.\\" Swan criticized the lack of background detail, which he felt would not get a campaign started. \\"There‚Äôs no suitable home base for the PCs. There aren‚Äôt any maps. There are a handful of adventure hooks, but no complete scenarios.\\" He concluded with an ambivalent recommendation: \\"The upside: solid characters, interesting magic system, good presentation. The downside: clunky combat mechanics, sketchy game world, no developed adventures. The verdict: a qualified thumbs up.\\" Reviews *Shadis #26 (April, 1996) *Arcane #12 (November 1996) References External links *Blood Dawn website Category:Science fiction role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1996 ","title":"Blood Dawn"},{"id":"8010455","text":"The Workers International Vanguard League (WIVL) is a Trotskyist organisation in South Africa.

Morris (born 26 February 1938) is an American equestrian. He won team silver in show jumping at the 1960 Rome Olympics and is considered a founding father of hunt seat equitation. He was chef d'equipe for the United States show jumping team, which won Olympic gold under his leadership, from 2005 until 2013. He also served as chef d'equipe for the Brazilian show jumping team at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Throughout his career, Morris has been a \\"proponent of the forward seat\\" and wrote several books on the subject, including Hunter Seat Equitation. Morris trained students at his Hunterdon Stables and traveling clinics, producing nationally and internationally successful riders, including Olympic champions. In 2019, after a SafeSport investigation, Morris was banned for life from the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) due to sexual misconduct with minors. Career = Early career: Rider = Morris began riding as a child in New Canaan, Connecticut. He and his siblings rode with the New Canaan Mounted Troop, and by 1947, Morris was riding at the Ox Ridge Hunt Club. In 1948, he competed and won for the first time. By 1949, he began competing in equitation, and in 1950 he first competed in the Maclay Horsemanship Finals. By 1952, Morris was training with coach Gordon Wright and riding his first great horse, Game Cock. At age fourteen, Morris won the 1952 ASPCA Maclay Horsemanship Finals and AHSA Hunt Seat Equitation Medal Finals, making him the youngest rider to do so. Morris tried out for the 1956 Olympic Games team, placing second in the trials. However he was not named to the United States team. Morris briefly attended the University of Virginia in 1956, but later said, \\"I got very poor marks because riding and partying was about all I studied.\\" In 1957, he joined the United States team on a national summer tour, and in 1958 competed in Europe for the first time. Morris represented the United States in international competition, winning team gold at the 1959 Pan American Games and team silver at the 1960 Rome Olympics. He also placed fourth individually at the Olympics. Morris rode on eight winning Nations Cup teams between 1958 and 1960.http://www.usefnetwork.com/GeorgeMorris2011/files/Meet_the_Clinicians.pdf Meet the Clinicians at the USEF Morris attempted an acting career in the early 1960s. With the help of agent Edith Van Cleve, he enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theater and performed in summer stock productions. After two years he returned to the horse world in 1962 or 1963 as a professional. = Later career: Coach, judge, chef d'equipe = Due to his status as a professional Morris could no longer compete for the United States team. He began a career teaching riding and training horses instead, producing many of the country's best riders in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He trained with Gunnar Andersen for a year, then started his own farm in 1964, leasing Dave Kelley's Armouk, New York facility. One of his early students, Jimmy Kohn, won the 1964 AHSA Medal Finals. Throughout the late 1960s, Morris split his time between Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, traveling to train at different facilities and competitions. In 1971 he bought property in Pittstown, New Jersey to establish Hunterdon Stables. For roughly the next thirty years he trained students at Hunterdon Stables in hunters, jumpers and equitation. His former students include Olympians: Conrad Homfeld, Leslie Burr-Howard and Melanie Smith Taylor won team gold in 1984; Lisa Jacquin, Anne Kursinski and Norman Dello Joio competed in 1992; Burr-Howard, Kursinski and Peter Leone won team silver in 1996; Chris Kappler won team gold and individual silver in 2004. In the 1980s, Morris began competing internationally again for a brief period. He broke his femur in a fall in 1986 and broke his neck a year later. In 1989, he retired his best horse, Rio, and by the early 1990s Morris decided to stop competing. In the late 1980s, Morris became president of the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame, and in 2000 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2005 Morris decided to sell Hunterdon Stables and became chef d'equipe of the United States show jumping team. During his term as chef d'equipe, the team won gold in the 2005 Samsung Super League, team silver at the 2006 World Equestrian Games, team gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and team gold and individual gold and silver at the 2011 Pan American Games. His last competition with the United States team was the 2012 London Olympics where the team finished sixth. His term as chef d'equipe ended in 2013, when he was replaced by Robert Ridland.https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/robert- ridland-approved-new-show-jumping-chef-d%E2%80%99equipe In 2016 Morris served as chef d'equipe for the Brazilian show jumping team at the Rio Olympics. George Morris was slated to be a clinician at the Hants County Exhibition in Nova Scotia in May/June 2016. Morris served on the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) National Jumper Committee and Planning Committee. He was president of the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame for over thirty years, before stepping down in January 2019. After turning over the presidency to Robert Ridland, Morris remained on the Hall of Fame's board of directors. For many years, Morris taught horsemanship clinics designed to develop young riders.http://www.nj.com/sports/njsports/index.ssf/2013/04/post_69.html = Lifetime ban for sexual misconduct = On 5 August 2019 Morris was provisionally banned by the US Center for SafeSport from USEF for sexual misconduct involving a minor. This ban was subject to appeal. In a statement issued that same day, Morris said, \\"I contest these findings wholeheartedly and am in the process of disputing them.\\" Some former students and professional riders, in interviews with the New York Times, said they were aware of Morris' relationships with minors throughout his career and particularly in the 1970s. Others, including Eric Lamaze, Robert Dover and former student Katie Prudent, have defended Morris through an \\"I Stand With George\\" Facebook page and hashtag. Independent arbitration regarding Morris' lifetime ban was held on 7 and 8 November 2019 in New York City. On 19 November 2019, after the appeal process ended, the lifetime ban was made permanent. Under the lifetime ban, which is reciprocated by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), Morris is not able to coach international teams for any country. He is also prohibited from coaching USEF members.  Legal issues  On 5 August 2020, two lawsuits were filed against Morris in New York's Manhattan Supreme Court; both suits allege the rape of minors and seek financial damages. The lawsuits also target USEF, which the plaintiffs claim turned a blind eye to sexual abuse, which was an \\"open secret\\" in the equestrian community.  Personal life  Morris was born in New York City, the son of Alice Van Arden Frank Morris and Harry H. Morris Junior. Morris has said he inherited a \\"nervous constitution,\\" and is \\"not crazy about people,\\" but is \\"passionate about riding and about training horses.\\" In his autobiography, Morris revealed that he partied at various clubs, including Studio 54, drank heavily, and has had several hundred sexual partners. He currently resides in Wellington, Florida where he keeps pet dogs, particularly beagles.  Legacy, awards and honors  Morris is honored with the George Morris Equitation Championship, a competition held at the Winter Equestrian Festival since 2007. The Hunterdon Cup, an equitation competition named after Morris' stables, was held from 2006 until 2019. On 26 November 2019, in the wake of Morris' lifetime ban, the USHJA announced that it had voted to eliminate two tributes to Morris: the Hunterdon Cup and the George H. Morris Trophy. The Hunterdon Cup will be renamed, while the George H. Morris Trophy will be removed. Publications Originally published in 1971, and now in its third edition, Morris' Hunter Seat Equitation often is recognized as the definitive work on the subject. Morris also has authored several other books and videos on riding and judging. Live broadcasts of training sessions led by Morris are featured on the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) network. http://www.usefnetwork.com/GeorgeMorris2011/ United States Equestrian Federation network, the national governing body for equestrian sport In 1989, Morris began contributing to the Chronicle of the Horse magazine's \\"Between Rounds\\" section. Morris also writes a column in the monthly equestrian magazine Practical Horseman, entitled Jumping Clinic, in which he critiques the jumping form of riders in reader-submitted photographs. He coined the term \\"drama riding\\" for the lack of classical position seen in riders in the show ring today. = Works = * Hunter Seat Equitation (1st ed. 1971, Rev ed. 1979, 3rd ed. 1990) * The American Jumping Style: Modern Techniques of Successful Horsemanship (1993) * George H.

Beginnings The original Seguida group was founded by a group of New York musicians whose ancestry was of Puerto Rican heritage. They were brought up in the urban South Bronx barrios where musical influences were a mixed bag. In these barrios, it wasn't unusual to hear the sounds of James Brown and Funkadelic coming from one apartment, while in another hear the sounds of Larry Harlow, Eddie Palmieri and Ray Barretto and still in another apartment you could hear the sounds of the Beatles, Cream, Motown, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Listening to all of these musical styles mixed together, became a way of life for Seguida. These diverse musical styles and rhythmic influences were embedded into their collective musical consciousness. It was only natural therefore, that when they decided to form a group, the results would be a mix of all the musical influences they had internalized in their formative years. Early Influence When Carlos Santana's smash hit interpretation of Tito Puente's ‚ÄúOye Como Va‚Äù, was released, it proved to be a driving force for these young New Yorican musicos. They formed two groups, one called \\"Latin Soul Inc.\\" with Angel Nater, Pete Nater and Eddie Montalvo, and the other called \\"Devoshun\\" with Steve Adorno, Lou Perez, Lori Rose and Carlos \\"Go-Go\\" Gomez. Both groups played at local high school dances, parties and street fairs. \\"Devoshun\\" and \\"Latin Soul Inc.‚Äôs\\" repertoire included the local AM radio station's hits of the era, with the added twist of integrating Latin Funk standards by Ray Barretto, Joe Bataan and Willie Colon. This was a very radical approach for the time, because local groups either specialized in playing Soul, Rock or Latin standards. Latin Soul Inc. broke this mold and became a local sensation. Their unique sound caught the ear of a young and upcoming Rock Bassist and arranger named Randy Ortiz, who was looking for a group that could realize his musical ideas of combining the electric power of a rock band with a fiery Latin rhythm section. The concept was taken a step further with the addition of a dual trumpet, dual brass sections that would be reminiscent of the conjunto sound...a style of orchestration which has deep roots in the New York Latin music scene. Under the musical direction of Randy Ortiz, the band leadership of percussionist Angel Nater Jr., and guitarist Louie Perez, Seguida began to refine its sound. The result was a style like no other. The sound grew to be the New York hybrid of Rock and Salsa! Fania Recording contract and Salsa TV show The group received much attention and soon became the opening act for Salsa luminaries such as Willie Colon, Larry Harlow, Ray Barretto and Eddie Palmieri. This exposure soon led to a recording contract with the reigning giant of the Salsa industry, Fania Records. Their debut album, \\"Love Is‚Ä¶Seguida\\" was released in 1974 and was well received by both the Salsa and Rock media in New York and Puerto Rico. The New York Newspaper \\"THE VILLAGE VOICE\\" Called SEGUIDA \\"THE SON'S OF SANTANA\\". The album scored a hit with ‚ÄúMambo Rock‚Äù, a scorching mambo that received a great deal of exposure on both Rock and Salsa radio stations. The song became the theme for The Izzy Sanabria \\"Salsa\\" TV Show that featured Seguida as its house band. They opened the now legendary \\"Fania All-Stars\\" concert at Yankee Stadium, which ended in crowd pandemonium during Ray Barretto's and Mongo Santamaria's infamous conga duel in August 1973. Tour and 2nd Album The group then went LIVE IN QUAD from Electric Lady Studios as part of New York radio station WXQR's live concert series. In September 1976, they were featured at the Village Gate's Salsa Meets Jazz series. From there, Seguida took off on a tour of Northeast and was the opening act for Sly and the Family Stone, James Taylor, Richie Havens, Ace, Crown Height Affair and Elephants Memory. In the summer of 1976, Seguida took to the studio again and delivered their second album, \\"On Our Way To Tomorrow\\"...Seguida. This album was composed during the height of the Disco era and is definitely heard on Side A of the album. Side B however, returned Seguida back to form with an outstanding collection of songs that took Latin Rock to a plateau never before reached. The song ‚ÄúYo Nunca Te Olvidare‚Äù is considered to be groundbreaking in its use of a totally Salsa format with English lyrics at its head, and Spanish vocal soneros during its montuno and solo sections. The song received much international airplay, and is considered by many to be the template for many of today's modern Salsa crossovers. Fania began to concentrate on their own in-house Latin crossover, The Fania All-Stars. Seguida's response was to create two spin-offs: \\"Somos‚Äù, which was a traditional Salsa group that included Ronnie Amorous along with Angel Nater Jr., Eddie Montalvo and, \\"The New York Big Apple All-Stars\\" which was a hot session group that specialized in recording tracks of popular Disco songs that were translated into Spanish for the Mexican and South American markets. Included here were Seguida's present bandleader Steve Adorno, Randy Ortiz, guitarist Lou Perez and SEGUIDA vocalist Lori Rose. Seguida went into the studio in 1978 and recorded material for their third album. That material was never released, but from all accounts, it was a treat that Seguida fans would have loved. The Future Seguida...To follow quickly without interruption..... SEGUIDA is a name that is very recognizable to the ardent Latin music aficionado. From their inception in 1972, Fania Record artists, Seguida had paved the way for the genre of Latin Rock to blossom. Their distinctive ‚ÄúEast Coast‚Äù Afro-Cuban-Salsa-Rock sound grew out of the barrios of the Bronx, NY and has continued to delight audiences all over the world in present times. Included as part of the ‚ÄúFania All Stars,‚Äù Seguida has toured extensively throughout the country spreading their infectious sounds of Latin- Rock-Jazz as they shared the stage with such great Latin music stars as Larry Harlow, Eddie Palmieri, Hector LaVoe, Willie Colon, and the list goes on...Their two albums on the Fania Music Label (Love is...Seguida, & On Our Way To Tomorrow...Seguida) still continue to enjoy record sales all over the world. Present-day bandleader/producer/composer/drummer, Steve Adorno has rekindled the band and brought a mixture of original and new members together to record a third & fourth CD. It's a journey into the future for this well established band of musicians. Produced by the team of Steve Adorno/Jay Henry, Seguida 3 brings tradition plus new innovations to the genre of Latin Alternative music. Continuing with their tradition of using English vocals (by Erix Alexander) and Spanish Soneros (by then studio band member - Joe Ortiz) to top off a hot salsa-soul-rock feel has proven to be a successful formula for Seguida, and it continues on with Seguida ELECTRIC SIESTA. SEGUIDA... brings professional experience with an exciting unique New York sound...a fusion of Latin passion, explosive Afro-Cuban rhythms, mixed with the influences of Rock, Soul, Jazz, Funk and Hip Hop.

Principal characters include Radboy's older friend Jonnyboy, methamphetamine addict boyfriends Finn and Critter, and a Swedish environmentalist, Ula, whose fianc√© has died, and who is seeking revenge for her sister's injury from a government-planted car bomb.

Hillsbery writes with a stream-of-consciousness narration style and frequently uses abbreviation and other teen slang. Reception War Boy had a mixed reception on publication. Advocate rates it a \\"tentative thumbs-up\\", describing it as disjointed and difficult to follow, but with a realism potentially appealing to young gay and lesbian teens. Jonathan Alexander of Lambda Book Report gives a more favorable review: \\"You don't always believe the characters, but you admire their punk bravado...War Boy is its own declaration of optimistic dissatisfaction, candid critique, and guerilla slapstick.\\" Peter Marcus of Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide writes, \\"Sometimes the ride is fun, sometimes not, and all too often the internal monologue detracts from plot.

Background The musicians included country rock and folk rock pioneers Gene Clark, Doug Dillard, Bernie Leadon, Chris Hillman, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Byron Berline, and Michael Clarke. However, the addition of Dillard's girlfriend Donna Washburn as a full-time harmony vocalist (and lead vocalist on \\"Rocky Top\\"), replacing Leadon, caused Leadon to leave the group and join Hillman, Clarke and Kleinow in the Flying Burrito Brothers, although he, Hillman and Kleinow appear as \\"special pickers\\" on the album. The core band on this album included Clark, Dillard, Washburn, David Jackson, fiddler Byron Berline, and drummer Jon Corneal, who had quit the Burritos, which made room for Clarke to join them. The large number of cover songs included on the album caused critical reaction to be decidedly less positive than on the prior album. As a result, Gene Clark also left the band after the album. Although Doug Dillard tried to continue the group as the Doug Dillard Expedition, the group soon came to an end. The tracks \\"Through the Morning, Through the Night\\" and \\"Polly\\" were covered by Alison Krauss and Robert Plant on their 2007 collaboration Raising Sand. Reception Music critic Richie Unterberger, writing for Allmusic, called the album \\"a disappointment in relation to their far more eclectic and original prior effort, The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark. The primary difference is that whereas the earlier record had leaned on Gene Clark's original compositions, and a reasonably adventurous attitude toward country-rock fusion in general, the follow-up saw them turning into a much more traditional folk/bluegrass act...

The station is currently owned by Dallas Broadcasting, LLC and is operated by [1160 Investments LLC]. The station operates on 1160 kHz with 35,000 watts during the day and 1,000 watts at night and is owned by Dallas Broadcasting LLC. KBDT broadcasts on the frequency of 1160 kHz, a United States clear-channel frequency. History KBDT's first license was granted 6-29-1960 according to the FCC. The station was formerly on 1150 kHz as KVIL and used the call letters KVIX from October 1985 to August 1986. The calls changed back to KVIL, which were in use until November 1994. The station was owned by Infinity Broadcasting until October 1996, when it was sold to Marcos A. Rodriguez, who was its owner until August 2003. Rodriguez programmed it with foreign language programs as KDMM. Due to the popular Pakistani and Indian music and talk programs, 1150 became all-South Asian formatted. Initially, the station was 1,000 watts daytime only with a 6 tower directional array north of Irving for a number of years. Either in the late 1980s or early 1990s, it was able to get a grant of 5 watts of power for night-time operation. With the directional signal looking right down I-635 on the north side of Dallas, it barely covered that area from the tower site to the I-635/US-75 interchange. In 2001, KDMM changed to KBIS, and ran an all-Motown format still on 1150 kHz. When the station moved to 1160 (now with 35,000 watts day and 1,000 watts at night from two different 6 tower sites), it was revamped as Magic 1160, adding other soul songs to the playlists, but the call sign didn't change to KMGS until June 2005. On August 23, 2006, the call sign changed to KVCE, to make way for a News‚ÄìTalk format, which began less than a month later. At that time Texas Senator Dan Patrick owned the station and had a talk show on the station. On September 25, 2015, the business talk format moved to KMKI, who changed the callsign to KEXB. KVCE previously ran a 30-second \\"barker\\" on a continuous loop announcing \\"KVCE Highland Park. Looking for business talk in North Texas? We moved to 620 AM.\\" The Business News/Talk format has been discontinued as of October 2019 with a flip to Spanish Christian as KTNO. In October 2015, KVCE was simulcasting KWRD-FM programming as a placeholder. KWRD-FM's programming was previously used as a placeholder on KMKI, after Radio Disney programming was discontinued and before Business Radio programming moved that frequency from KVCE. On September 29, 2017, the station changed its call sign to KBDT. On November 1, 2017 1160 Investments LLC entered into an agreement with Dallas Broadcasting LLC and created a conservative talk format which is the current format. 1160 Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company which also owns the USA Radio Network and some USA programming is produced from the studios in Dallas.

Olson was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She earned her B.A. in studio art from Macalester College in 1973,Inglot, Joanna (2006). WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pp. 117-20. . and her M.F.A. in Visual Studies from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1998. Olson's work has been on exhibition continuously throughout the United States since 1973, sometimes in group exhibitions, and sometimes in solo exhibitions. She has works that are part of permanent collections throughout the United States as well. Art and Feminism =Involvement with Feminist Art Movements= The intersection of art and feminism can be seen in Olson's works of art, and also throughout other aspects of her life. In an interview she gave in 1980, she reflected on her relationship to feminism: \\"Right when I graduated from college, I became very interested in the feminist movement and what it meant for me personally.\\" She is a founding member of the Women's Art Registry of Minnesota, also known as WARM: she joined the collective in 1975 as one of its youngest members, and served as chief designer form WARM journal. WARM began as a women's art collective in the 1970s. In 1976, they opened a gallery in Minneapolis, MN, and registered as a nonprofit organization. \\"The bylaws defined WARM as a feminist organization that aimed to foster communication among professional artists in Minnesota, to promote their development and careers, and to enhance their visibility.\\" The lasting legacy of WARM can still be found today, albeit in a different incarnation. Today's WARM is based in Eden Prairie, MN, and provides mentoring, networking opportunities, exhibition opportunities, and an online registry of works for women artists in the Midwest. Olson and her colleague Elizabeth Erickson have taught the Women's Art Institute, a summer intensive studio program, since 1999. The Women's Art Institute was housed at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design from its inception in 1999, until it moved to St. Catherine University in September 2012. When the Women's Art Institute made the move from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design to St. Catherine University, Olson took over as the new director of the program. For this work, \\"[t]hey were named 'Changemakers of 2009' by the Minnesota Women's Press for promoting greater self-determination, equality and justice for women and girls.\\" =The Mysteries= Between 1996 and 1999, Olson created an ambitious series of oil paintings inspired by the ancient frescoes in the Pompeiian Villa of the Mysteries. The backgrounds of these large-scale pictures are rendered in a deep red, like the Roman frescoes on which they're based, and feature the artist herself along with various props and symbols including skeletons, masks, a ladder, a mirror, and a painting easel. Using herself as a recurring model in the paintings, Olson aimed to \\"claim a bond with the old mysteries\\" and to \\"paint the possibility of the emergence of the midlife woman into history as active, powerful and self-determined.\\" She cites as inspiration for The Mysteries the book Those Women by Eleanor L. Hall. =The Catherine Portrait= In 2008, Olson was named the Sister Mona Riley Endowed Professor in the Humanities At St. Catherine University.http://patriciaolsonart.com/catherineportrait.html The title was held until 2011. This honor gave her the time and resources to embark on a project requiring a deep investment of both time and energy. During this time Olson dedicated herself to The Catherine Portrait, a series of 40 16\\" by 16\\" portrait paintings of members of the St. Catherine University community, including students, faculty, and staff. The paintings are generally from the tip of the shoulders to the top of the head, and this perspective paired with the bright, clean colors of the paint create a sense of intimate proximity with the subjects. Olson conceived of the project through the interest she has always had in portraiture coupled with an idea that people in a group have something in common that comes out visually. The sampling of the community is meant to represent the zeitgeist of the community. Olson acts to reclaim the idea of a portrait, and the responsibility she as a painter of portraits has to those she paints. = How to Be a Feminist Artist: Investigations from the Women‚Äôs Art Institute = After many years as instructors/directors of the Women's Art Institute, Olson and Erickson noted \\"emerging themes that concern contemporary women artists.\\" In 2014, they distilled these themes into seven \\"√ºber questions\\" and curated an exhibition (open Feb. 3‚ÄìMarch 23, 2014) of 11 artists who had previously participated in the Women‚Äôs Art Institute and \\"whose work examines and illuminates these questions: * How do I keep working in the studio, using my artistic skills and materials to express my intentions? * How can I unlock my toolbox and truly express my authentic creative voice? * Who is my audience and what do I want to show them? What does success look like for me? * Where can I find a supportive community? How can I support others? * What does it mean to have a woman‚Äôs body and make art?

The highway runs from a junction with M-15 west of the unincorporated community of Munger in Bay County to the intersection with M-24 east of Akron in Tuscola County. The trunkline runs through rural agricultural areas outside of the villages and communities it serves. It was designated in the 1930s and extended in the 1940s. M-138 was truncated in the 1990s as well. Route description M-138 begins at a junction with M-15 (Tuscola Road) just west of Munger in Merritt Township. Known as Munger Road, the highway then heads due east through agricultural fields. On the east side of Munger, the roadway crosses a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. M-138 continues east through farm fields and across the Bay‚ÄìTuscola county line at Reese Road. The road name changes in Tuscola County to Fairgrove Road, and the trunkline remains on an easterly track to the community of Fairgrove. In the village, M-138 follows Center Street over another crossing of the Huron and Eastern Railway to a junction with Main Street. The highway turns north on Main and crosses the rail line a second time as they both exit town. North of Fairgrove, Main Street becomes Thomas Road, and M-138 runs northward along it through farm fields. After a course, M-138 turns eastward again along Akron Road. The highway passes through the village of Akron on Beach Street, crossing the rail line a final time. West of town the Akron Road name resumes, and M-138 terminates at the intersection with M-24 (Unionville Road). M-138 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-138 were the 2,342 vehicles daily near Munger; the lowest count was 499 vehicles per day just west of Akron. No section of M-138 has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-138 became a part of the state highway system in 1931 between then M-24 (current M-15) in Bay County and then M-83 in Tuscola County. In early 1940, the highway was extended east and northeasterly through Akron to end at M-25 in Unionville; by the end of the year, all of M-138 was paved. When M-24 was extended northward from Caro in 1997, it supplanted the M-138 designation from the Akron area north to Unionville; the latter highway was truncated to its current form as a result.

Anne Frank described the tree from The Annexe, the building where she and her family were hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Over the years, the tree deteriorated significantly due to both a fungus and a moth infestation. The Borough Amsterdam Centrum declared that the tree had to be cut down on 20 November 2007 due to the risk that it could otherwise fall down. However, on 21 November 2007, a judge issued a temporary injunction stopping the removal. The Foundation and the neighbours developed an alternative plan to save the tree. The neighbours and supporters formed the Foundation Support Anne Frank Tree which carried out the suggested supporting construction and took over the maintenance of the tree. On 23 August 2010, the tree was blown down by high winds during a storm, breaking off approximately above ground.Anne Frank tree falls over in heavy wind Reuters. US Edition. Mon 23 August 2010 12:23 pm EDT'Anne Frankboom' omgewaaid NOS Nieuws, 23 August 2010http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE67M28P20100823 Reuters report, with images It fell across a garden wall and damaged garden sheds but did not damage anything else. The tree was estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old. Anne Frank The tree is mentioned three times in Anne Frank's diary The Diary of a Young Girl. On 23 February 1944, she writes about the tree: Otto Frank, Anne's father, described his thoughts upon reading the diary for the first time in a 1968 speech. He described his surprise at learning of the tree's importance to Anne as follows: Interactive project The Anne Frank Tree is also the name of an interactive project started by the Anne Frank House in 2006, when it was opened by Emma Thompson. Visitors to the museum are able to leave their name and location on a \\"leaf\\" of the tree, showing their affinity with Anne Frank. Part of the intended audience of the on-line project are students of the more than 200 schools in the world named after Anne Frank. Decline The tree in 2003 Concerns about the tree's health date back to at least 1993, when a soil analysis revealed that leakage from a nearby underground domestic fuel tank was endangering the tree's root system. The city of Amsterdam spent ‚Ç¨160,000 on a soil sanitation program to save the tree. For the last several years, the tree was attacked by a particularly aggressive fungus (Ganoderma applanatum, also called \\"Artist's Conk\\" or \\"Artist's Bracket\\") which rotted the wood and undermined the tree's stability. Additionally, horse-chestnut leaf miner moth caterpillars (Cameraria ohridella) ate the tree's leaves, causing them to turn brown prematurely and fall off. On 26 May 2005, the tree's crown was drastically trimmed after a six-month study by botanists concluded that this was the best way to ensure the tree's stability. However, the fungal disease continued to thrive, and a 2006 study estimated that 42% of the wood was rotten. Some botanists concluded that the tree's death was unavoidable and the owner of the property decided to ask for a permit to cut the tree down in order to eliminate the risk of the huge tree collapsing. In September 2007, an appeals panel made two decisions: one upholding the right of the tree's owner to have it cut down any time in the next two years, and one granting a request by the country's Trees Institute to investigate the possibility of saving it. Property owner Henric Pomes of Keizersgracht 188, adjacent to the building that is now the Anne Frank Museum, agreed to wait for the institute's proposal, due before 1 January 2008. On 2 October 2007, and later the Dutch Tree Foundation (), was involved in the discussions. On 15 November 2007, it claimed the tree was healthy enough to cause no danger, based upon second opinion analysis by Neville Fay (a famous English expert of ancient trees) and by Frits Gielissen (a Dutch expert from O.B.T.A. De Linde). On 13 November 2007, the Borough Amsterdam-Centrum declared that it would cut down the tree on 21 November 2007. The next day, a pulling test was banned, but four days after that, this assessment of the strength of the tree was conducted. Boom-KCB, an engineering firm specialized in trees,Boom-kcb.nl ‚Äì official website of Boom-KCB determined that the tree was \\"storm-proof\\", and able to sustain itself, eliminating the need for outside interference as it did not pose a danger for the public. A court hearing involving the Tree Foundation was held the day before the scheduled removal. On 21 November 2007, it was decided to stop the removal. On the same day, the Borough and the Anne Frank Foundation held a press conference during which they repeated their claim that there existed an \\"acute danger\\". They urged the Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, to proceed with emergency cutting. On 17 December 2007, the working committee Support Anne Frank Tree presented its alternative plan to preserve the tree (the report has English abstracts & conclusions) which included a construction to prevent the trunk from breaking down. Some weeks later, tree experts from both sides presented a joint evaluation of the tree. Their judgment was that the tree had a life expectancy of at least 5‚Äì15 years. To ensure safety, the supporting construction should be built. In May 2008 the supporting structure was finished: it was designed to help the tree to survive at least five more years.De Volkskrant, 8 April 2008, p. 3Support Anne Frank Tree.nl On 23 August 2010, the tree was blown over in a rain-and-gale storm, breaking off about a meter above the ground. It fell across a garden wall and damaged garden sheds but did not damage anything else. The next day, it was reported that a small side shoot was growing out of the stump below where it broke, and it is hoped that it will grow into a new tree. There are plans to keep large pieces of the fallen trunk and its large branches. The fallen tree is estimated to weigh about 27 metric tons.Small shoot to give Anne Frank tree new life Huffington Post, 24 August 2010 Some of the images in the Reuters report show, for most of the cross-section of the trunk, the characteristic fracture pattern of decayed wood across all the trunk cross-section except a thin rim of sapwood.

In the summer of 2010, a sapling was planted in Batsford Arboretum near Moreton- in-Marsh, Glos, UK, a poignant memorial to one of the victims of a regime that Diana and Unity Mitford regarded so highly. Diana and Unity were the daughters of 2nd Baron Redesdale a former owner of Batsford. On 25 February 2015, a sapling was planted in Lister Park, Bradford, UK.

It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 2008, the population was suspected to number less than 250 mature individuals. The Northwest African cheetah was described by German zoologist Max Hilzheimer in 1913 under the scientific name Acinonyx hecki. Taxonomy Felis jubata senegalensis was described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843 based on a cheetah from Senegal. As this name was preoccupied, it is considered synonymous with A. j. hecki. Acinonyx hecki was the scientific name proposed by Max Hilzheimer in 1913, based upon a captive cheetah in the Berlin Zoological Garden that also originated in Senegal. Characteristics A pale cheetah at Termit Massif, Niger The Northwest African cheetah is quite different in appearance from the other African cheetahs. Its coat is shorter and nearly white in color, with spots that fade from black over the spine to light brown on the legs. The face has few or even no spots, and the tear stripes (dark stripes running from the medial canthus of each eye down the side of the muzzle to the corner of the mouth) are often missing. The body shape is basically the same as that of the sub-Saharan cheetah, except that it is somewhat smaller. Distribution and habitat This cheetah ranges in the western and central Sahara and the Sahel in small, fragmented populations. Based on data from 2007 to 2012, the cheetah population in West, Central and North Africa has been estimated at 457 individuals in an area of , including 238 cheetahs in Central African Republic and Chad, 191 cheetahs in Algeria and Mali, and 25 cheetahs in the transboundary W, Arli, and Pendjari protected area complex in Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. In Niger, populations occur in the northern parts of the country in the T√©n√©r√© desert and in the southern savanna region of W National Park. Records in Togo date to the 1970s. The Saharan cheetah is thought to be regionally extinct in Morocco, Western Sahara, Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. In Mali, cheetahs were sighted in Adrar des Ifoghas and in the Kidal Region in the 1990s. In 2010, a cheetah was photographed in Niger's Termit Massif by a camera trap.Walker, M. (2010). 'Ghostly' Saharan cheetah filmed in Niger, Africa. BBC Earth News, 23 December 2010. No cheetah was recorded in the North Province, Cameroon during a survey carried out between January 2008 and May 2010. Between August 2008 and November 2010, four individuals were recorded by camera traps in Ahaggar National Park located in south central Algeria. A single cheetah was once again filmed and photographed by Algerian naturalists in 2020 in the same park in the Atakor volcanic field whose peaks approach a height of . Behavior and ecology In the Sahara desert, day-time temperature exceeds , water is scarce and rainfall irregular. Two camera trapping surveys in the Ahaggar massif revealed that cheetahs in this area exhibit several behavioral adaptations to this harsh climate: they are predominantly nocturnal and active between sunset and early mornings; they travel larger distances and occur at a lower density than cheetahs living in savannas. The main prey of the Northwest African cheetah are antelopes which have adapted to an arid environment, such as the addax, Dorcas gazelle, rhim gazelle, and dama gazelle. It also preys on smaller mammals such as hares. Cheetahs can subsist without direct access to water, obtaining water indirectly from the blood of their prey.

Originally from Edmonton, Alberta, The Kubasonics are honoured in the Ukrainian Canadian community for recreating traditional Ukrainian melodies, with a twist. Humorous or surprising alterations to time-honored songs create a sound that is often described as a \\"folk fusion.\\" To create their unique sound, the Kubasonics incorporate traditional Ukrainian instruments such as the tsymbaly, drymba and Hurdy-gurdy into the context of a western rock band.  History  = Formation and Alberta = The Kubasonics premi√®re performance was at Edmonton‚Äôs Hopak in the Park in June 1996. Leading member Brian Cherwick had met many of his soon-to-be bandmates as he studied at the University of Alberta earning a PhD (\\"Polkas on the Prairies: Ukrainian Music and the Construction of Identity\\") from the Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies. The founding members of the Kubasonics were Brian, Brian‚Äôs brother - Paul Cherwick (drums), Brian‚Äôs late wife - Beth Cherwick (violin), Jay Lind (guitar) and Bill Yacey (bass).Brian, Paul, Jay, and Bill all contributed to the band‚Äôs 2005 album titled \\"Big Beet Music.\\" Additionally, Thom Bennet (drums), Rod Olstad (vocals and violin), Taras Zakordonski (bass), and Maria Cherwick (violin) worked on \\"Big Beet Music.\\"Of the band members who contributed to \\"Big Beet Music\\", only Brian Cherwick, Paul Cherwick, Maria Cherwick, Bill Yacey, and Taras Zakordonski are of Ukrainian origin. Individually, the band members have had a wide range of musical influences. In particular, D-Drifters 5, known for playing traditional Ukrainian polka music, were an inspiration for Brian who started playing piano at a young age and percussion in university. The Kubasonics have played renditions of some songs by the D-Drifters 5. Over the years, they added more of Brian‚Äôs writing and contemporary pieces to the folk music of their performance repertoire. The track \\"Giants of the Prairies\\" from their album of the same title exemplifies one of their sillier songs. They sing about landmarks like Vegreville, Alberta‚Äôs enormous Easter egg, Glendon, Alberta's giant perogy, and Vilna, Alberta‚Äôs massive mushroom. This track was even played on a CBC program about gigantic landmarks.Judith Gennett, \\"The Kubasonics, Giants Of the Prairies (self-produced, 2002) The Black Cat Orchestra, Mysteries Explained (Irene, 2001),\\" 13 October 2008 \\"Giants of the Prairies\\" was not the only Kubasonics song to be played on national television. Another song off \\"Giants of the Prairies\\", \\"Billy Mosienko\\", was played on Hockey Night in Canada as a tribute for the 50th anniversary of Mosienko's 21-second hat-trick. Despite some silly songs, the Kubasonics retain a sense of traditionalism on their albums. Songs like \\"Early Bird Of Spring,\\" from their \\"Giants of the Prairies\\" album appeal to some of their more conservative listeners.Judith Gennett, \\"The Kubasonics, Giants Of the Prairies (self-produced, 2002) The Black Cat Orchestra, Mysteries Explained (Irene, 2001),\\" 13 October 2008 The popularity of the Kubasonics is not limited to the Canadian music community. In the summer of 2008, the band performed in major Ukrainian cities including L‚Äôviv and Kiev. The band also performed at the 2008 Canadian National Ukrainian Festival, which was held on August 1 through 3rd. For the CNUF, held in Dauphin, Manitoba, the Kubasonics are appropriate performers since one goal of the festival is to present the unique Ukrainian culture of Canada.\\"Canada‚Äôs National Ukrainian Festival,\\" 2008, 15 October 2008.

In contrast to performing in front of thousands of festival attendees at Toronto‚Äôs annual Ukrainian Festival, another one of the band‚Äôs memorable gigs was their smaller-scale 10th Anniversary Concert. In the summer of 2011 The Kubasonics hosted a 15th anniversary concert at Queen Alex Hall in Edmonton. It marked the 15th year of the band's history and the last official Kubasonics concert \\"for a while\\", before Brian Cherwick moved to St. John's Newfoundland. = Relocation to Newfoundland and \\"Kubfunland\\" = In 2011, bandleader Brian Cherwick relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland, where he became involved in the local music community. In September 2015, Brian formed a new iteration of The Kubasonics featuring past member, Maria Cherwick on violin, past guest musician, Jacob Cherwick on drums, Darren \\"Boobie\\" Browne on guitar, Matt Hender on bass and Paul Bendzsa on clarinet and saxophone. In March 2017, The Kubasonics were selected to travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, as part of the Club One New Releases television program presented by Bell Media and FLOW TV.

With a new location, direction and sensibility, D‚ÄôAri set out to create a record that truly reflected the time and space in his life. Calling upon some of his most respected friends and musicians to collaborate with, Country Porno Electric Fireplace is a courageously honest, layered mix of new and old influences that depicts the energy of every musician who helped fully realize each track. Thoroughly enjoying the process of collaborating with like-minded musicians on the new record, on any given night Nine Mile can now be experienced as a duo or as a seven-piece ensemble. Over the years, Nine Mile has toured internationally, sharing stages with The Black Keys, Joel Plaskett, G. Love and Special Sauce, Gomez, Xavier Rudd, Cowboy Junkies, Blackalicious, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Sarah Harmer, Donovan Frankenreiter and Pete Murray to name just a few. The band will soon be announcing tour dates that are set to take place throughout Fall 2009 in support of the new record which will be released on Dread Rock/Xiola distributed via Conveyor/Universal Music Canada. Recent touring partners include: Xavier Rudd, Donavon Frankenreiter, Blackalicious, Pete Murray, Ben Harper and more. Nine Mile is signed to Dreadrock Records, a self- owned indie label. Dreadrock has licensed Nine Mile's recordings to Liberation/Warner Australia, and Entak/Universal Japan.

Covering and holding , it supplied the city with drinking water during the 19th century. Its massive granite walls, which presented a vaguely Egyptian-style facade, were thick. Atop the walls was a public promenade offering panoramic views; Edgar Allan Poe enjoyed walking there. When established, the Croton Aqueduct was New York City's foremost water source. Filling began July 4, 1842 amidst great fanfare. Prior to construction of the aqueduct, water was obtained from cisterns, wells and barrels from rain. The aqueduct and reservoir obtained their names from the water's source, a series of mostly underground conduits that would bring water from the Croton River in northern Westchester County to New York City's spigots. Demolition A remnant of the reservoir can still be seen today at the foundation of the South Court of the New York Public Library Main Branch. Vestiges of Croton Distributing Reservoir embedded in the foundation of the New York Public Library Main Branch The Reservoir was torn down in the 1890s. Today, the Main Branch of the New York Public Library, located in the eastern portion of Bryant Park, stands at that location. Some of the reservoir's original foundation can still be found in the South Court at the Main Branch. Today water is primarily supplied to New York City via its three city water tunnels. The decommissioned Central Park Reservoir still remains, but has not operated as part of the Croton Aqueduct system since 1993. Subway commuters can see historical photographs showing the former reservoir. The display is located on the wall in the underground passageway that connects the Fifth Avenue station on the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line () and the 42nd Street‚ÄìBryant Park station on the IND Sixth Avenue Line (). A few years before the reservoir was torn down, there were two tablets affixed to the Reservoir. The inscription was: > HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE CROTON AQUEDUCT ‚Äì The Law > authorizing the construction of the work, passed May 2nd, 1834. Stephen > Allen, William W. Fox, Saul Alley, Charles Dusenberry and Benjamin M. Brown > were appointed Commissioners. During the year 1834, two surveys were > made‚Äîone by DAVID B. DOUGLASS and the other by JOHN MARTINEAU.

It has been often confused with the similar-looking Tricholoma scalpturatum. Taxonomy French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described this species as Agaricus argyraceus in 1779, before his countryman Claude Casimir Gillet gave it its current name in 1874. The generic name derives from the Greek trichos/œÑœÅŒπœáŒøœÇ 'hair' and loma/ŒªœâŒºŒ± 'hem', 'fringe' or 'border'. It lies within the section Terrea within the subgenus Tricholoma within the genus Tricholoma. Description The cap is conical initially and flattening to a convex shape, with a prominent boss. Measuring 1.5 to 6 cm (0.6‚Äì2.4 in) in diameter, it is covered with greyish scales, paler than other grey-capped tricholomas, and the crowded gills are white or pale grey and emarginate or adnate in cross section. They sometimes stain yellowish when bruised. The thin flesh is cream or white and has a farinaceous (floury) and somewhat rancid taste and smell. The whitish stipe is 2‚Äì5 cm (0.8‚Äì1 in) high and 0.3‚Äì0.8 cm (0.1‚Äì0.3 in) wide and has no ring and a tapering base. The poisonous T. pardinum is similar in appearance but with coarser scales on its cap. T.scalpturatum has a darker cap without a boss. Distribution and habitat Tricholoma argyraceum occurs across Europe but is uncommon overall. The fruit bodies appear from June to December (occasionally earlier in Spring). The species has an ectomycorrhizal association with a number of genera ‚Äì birch (Betula), Carpinus, oak (Quercus) and Tilia.  Synonyms  Obsolete synonyms for Tricholoma argyraceum include: *Agaricus argyraceus Bull. 1779 *Agaricus myomyces var. argyraceus (Bull.) Pers. 1801 *Tricholoma argyraceum f. inocybeoides (A.

Her most celebrated work is the picture book Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1972), which was a New York Times Notable Book and a Caldecott Honor Book (one runner-up for the Caldecott Medal).  Biography  Burkert was born in Sterling, Colorado, and moved with her family to Wisconsin in 1945. She received both her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Burkert's first illustration work was for James and the Giant Peach in 1961. In 1982, she was co-author of a museum catalog for the Milwaukee Art Museum, on the Wisconsin artist John Wilde. She won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Special Award for Valentine and Orson in 1990. In 2003, she was subject of an exhibition at the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst.  Work  Her early work demonstrated a command of shading and texture through pencil and charcoal, in addition to her usual media of pen and ink combined with colored pencil and watercolor. Beginning with The Nightingale and concluding with Snow White, her mastery of light, shadow and depth combined Renaissance chiaroscuro with an Oriental awareness of space in settings that were realistic in detail, yet also fanciful and timeless in content. Her later work continued this emphasis on intense, intimate detail, revealing a passion for the complexity and variety of life. Her illustration work on Valentine & Orson was considered to be a consistently whole work of art that was remarkable for its attention to detail and luminosity.

The line of confections included truffles of various sizes, slicks, and mosaics. Joseph Schmidt confections ceased operations in 2009. History =Early= Joseph Schmidt Confections was started in San Francisco during 1983. Joseph Schmidt, a European-trained baker, opened the store with his partner Audrey Ryan, a European-trained confectioner, and together, they sold baked goods and chocolates. Joseph Schmidt's signature egg-shaped truffle was the company's trademark. In 1985, Joseph and Audrey brought in two partners to grow the business: Jeff Smith, a successful restaurateur and veteran of Nestle, and Duane Papierniak, an engineer. They continued to run the company until 2005, growing the business both nationally and internationally. At different times, Joseph Schmidt products have been available in such department stores as Harrod's and Selfridges in the UK, David Jones Limited in Australia, Takashimaya in Tokyo, and a variety of locations in Canada. North America includes department stores such as Macy's, Bloomingdales, and Saks Fifth Avenue, and gourmet grocery stores such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and the Fresh Market, as well as other independent stores. The company had stores in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and in San Jose. =Current= In November 2005, Joseph Schmidt Confections was purchased by Artisan Confections Company, a Hershey subsidiary, which had previously purchased Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, an artisanal chocolate manufacturer in nearby Berkeley, California. In November 2006 Artisan Confections purchased Dagoba, an Ashland, Oregon-based manufacturer of organic chocolate. Hershey's later began to consolidate the production of Scharffen Berger products in an upgraded factory in Robinson, Illinois. In early 2009 Hershey's announced plans to eliminate the Joseph Schmidt brand. By July 2009 both the production facility and retail store on 16th Street in San Francisco closed, laying off approximately 150 local employees.

It has a distinctive bright yellow colour and an unusual smell likened to coal gas. It occurs in deciduous woodlands in Europe from spring to autumn. Taxonomy Tricholoma sulphureum was first described in 1784 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and given the name Agaricus sulphureus, before being placed in the genus Tricholoma by German mycologist Paul Kummer in 1871. The specific epithet sulf«îrƒõus derived from the Latin 'of or pertaining to sulfur'. It belongs to a complex of similar foul-smelling species such as Tricholoma inamoenum. Another related species, T. bufonium, may be an intraspecific variant. Description It has a convex cap with a vague umbo up to across, sulphur yellow in colour. The thick, sinuate gills, stipe and flesh are similarly bright yellow. The smell, caused by the chemical skatole, is enough to distinguish it from other yellow fungi. John Ramsbottom reports that it has a complex smell that has been likened variously to Jasmine, Narcissus, Hyacinth, Hemerocallis flava, Lilac, Tagetes, decayed hemp or coal gas, as well as described as nauseating or foetid.* The taste is bitter. It could be confused with the darker T. equestre, though the latter has a sticky cap, white flesh, thin crowded gills, and a mealy smell. However this latter species which was formerly considered a good edible mushroom, would have itself caused sporadic cases of poisoning. Distribution and habitat Tricholoma sulphureum is found in deciduous woods, particularly beech, and can occur anytime from spring until autumn. It is found across Europe and has been confirmed as far east as China. It is also distributed in North America, where it grows also with conifers. It is commonly known as the \\"Stinker\\" or \\"Sulfur Trich\\". In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered. Toxicity The fungus is usually classified as inedible in guidebooks, although there have been reports of poisoning. Symptoms are predominantly gastrointestinal with some neurological.

Great Gull Island is a island separating Long Island and Block Island sounds, located approximately southwest of Little Gull Island. Both islands are located in Suffolk County, New York, and lie roughly midway between Plum Island and Fishers Island. History A major stopover for birds following the Atlantic Flyway, Great Gull Island was the home of large colonies of nesting terns up until the end of the 19th century, when many birds were killed as a result of the millinery trade and the construction of military fortifications on the island. In 1897, Fort Michie was constructed on Great Gull Island as part of the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound. The military base was operational from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War through World War II. It included one of the largest gun installations in the United States, an emplacement for a 16-inch gun on a disappearing carriage.Fort Michie at FortWiki.com Great Gull Island was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History on March 31, 1949. It marked the beginning of the Great Gull Island Project, a long-term effort by staff from the museum and other volunteers to restore the island's ecosystem. Gradually, terns began returning to the island to nest, and the population grew into one of the largest colonies in the world for two species of terns. Terns The dominant faunal feature of the island during the summer months is the active Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) colony spread across the flatter areas of the island that are not taken over by bittersweet (Celastrus) or common reed (Phragmites australis). A tentative estimation of the S. hirundo mating pairs present on the island estimates their number at 9,500. The other major avian on Great Gull Island is the Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii), which mostly inhabit the ring of boulders that cover the edges of the island. Originally, these boulders were arranged to prevent erosion and were placed there by the US Army. However, the Roseates are well suited to the narrow crevices and hard-to-reach spaces created in this environment, with their young quite adept at vanishing in between the rocks, only becoming accessible when a parent calls to summon them. The population of S. dougallii populating the island is estimated be around 1,300 mating pairs, though no complete census is available. Personnel The founder and director of the Great Gull Island Project is Helen Hays, who has been managing the island since 1969. Joe DiCostanzo is responsible for running the database detailing the family history, hatching records, and nest location of many of the birds hatched on or visiting the island. The Great Gull Island Program has an ongoing partnership with several Argentine projects that monitor the terns during the winter and spring months. Occasionally, as a show of support, an Argentine delegation will arrive to assist in preparation work for \\"peak week\\", when hatchings-per-day can range into the thousands. In recognition of their contribution, the west end of the island is thus named \\"Little Argentina\\".

It is a sequel to The Web and the Rock, which, along with the collection The Hills Beyond, was extracted from the same manuscript. The novel tells the story of George Webber, a fledgling author, who writes a book that makes frequent references to his home town of Libya Hill which was actually Asheville, North Carolina. The book is a national success but the residents of the town had been unhappy with what they view as Webber's distorted depiction of them, send the author menacing letters and death threats. Wolfe, as in many of his other novels, explores the changing American society of the 1920s/30s, including the stock market crash, the illusion of prosperity, and the unfair passing of time which prevents Webber ever being able to return \\"home again.\\" In parallel to Wolfe's relationship with the United States, the novel details his disillusionment with Germany during the rise of Nazism. Wolfe scholar Jon Dawson argues that the two themes are connected most firmly by Wolfe's critique of capitalism and comparison between the rise of capitalist enterprise in the United States in the 1920s and the rise of fascism in Germany during the same period. The artist Alexander Calder appears, fictionalized as \\"Piggy Logan.\\" Plot summary George Webber has written a successful novel about his family and hometown. When he returns to that town, he is shaken by the force of outrage and hatred that greets him. Family and lifelong friends feel naked and exposed by what they have seen in his books, and their fury drives him from his home. Outcast, George Webber begins a search for his own identity. It takes him to New York and a hectic social whirl; to Paris with an uninhibited group of expatriates; to Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler's shadow. The journey comes full circle when Webber returns to America and rediscovers it with love, sorrow, and hope. Title Wolfe took the title from a conversation with the writer Ella Winter, who remarked to Wolfe: \\"Don't you know you can't go home again?\\" Wolfe then asked Winter for permission to use the phrase as the title of his book. The title is reinforced in the denouement of the novel in which Webber realises: \\"You can't go back home to your family, back home to your childhood ... back home to a young man's dreams of glory and of fame ... back home to places in the country, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time ‚Äì back home to the escapes of Time and Memory.\\" (Ellipses in original.) Nostalgia is a fond memory (\\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder\\") arising out of an absent person's inability to perceive changes that take place over time on things one remembers as static and permanent. Attempting to relive youthful memories is doomed to failure. This sentiment is closely mirrored in the final pages of Marcel Proust's novel Swann's Way, the first installment of his lengthy work In Search of Lost Time.

History The township was originally formed on April 10, 1797, from portions of Saddle River Township and Franklin Township in Bergen County, and incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of the state's initial group of 104 townships.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606‚Äì1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 211. Accessed December 11, 2012. On March 10, 1834, West Milford was created from portions of the township. When Passaic County, New Jersey was established on February 7, 1837, it included Pompton Township. The borough of Pompton Lakes, New Jersey was formed on February 26, 1895, during the peak of the \\"Boroughitis\\" phenomenon, as the second municipality to split from the township. The township was divided on February 23, 1918, into three boroughs: Bloomingdale, Ringwood and Wanaque, with the remaining portion passing to Pompton Lakes. This ended the existence of the township. According to news accounts at the time of the split, local leaders from the various communities felt that the population growth within the township was a hindrance to the ability of the Township Committee to govern. Citizens of Haskell (now part of Wanaque) had begun to discuss the formation of their own borough and this prompted citizens in the other sections to follow their lead. A significant portion of the land was sparsely populated and the split off of one community would leave a larger tax burden on those that remained. A meeting was called for January 12, 1918, to discuss the pros and cons of splitting the township. From that, a committee representing the various sections was formed and eventually three boroughs were agreed on, the boundaries established and finances settled (share of debt, distribution of assets). In addition, the township school district was similarly divided into the separate districts for each borough. The vote to split was approved in all three sections in February. The final Township Committee meeting took place on May 14, 1918, in Midvale to finalize the disbursement of cash in the township treasury to the three boroughs and pay off remaining debt owed to the county. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of the five municipalities that were formed from Pompton Township -- Bloomingdale (7,656), Pompton Lakes (11,097), Ringwood (12,228), Wanaque (11,116) and West Milford (25,850) -- was 67,947, which would have made Pompton the 16th largest municipality in the state (and fourth largest in Passaic County, not far behind Passaic) if it still existed today.

Generally, shakedown cruises are performed before a ship enters service or after major changes such as a crew change, repair or overhaul. The shakedown cruise simulates working conditions for the vessel, for various reasons. For most new ships, the major reasons are to familiarise a crew with a new vessel and to ensure all of the ship's systems are functional. If the ship is the first of its class, it will likely also be performing its sea trials, a test of its performance. In this context, 'shakedown cruise' and 'sea trials' may be used interchangeably, though each has a slightly different meaning. In such a case, it is likely that the ship's systems will be pushed to redline, or maximum capacity, to demonstrate the class's speed and other important traits. Until bested by another ship of the same class, this shakedown performance will be the standard of the class's capabilities, and its success may determine whether the class is to enter full production. In the travel industry a shakedown cruise is also undertaken to test the ship and service crew. These test cruises are sometimes made with passengers travelling at a discount. It has been suggested that the origin of ‚Äúshakedown cruise‚Äù comes from the need to settle (or literally shake down) the ballast in the hold of a ship to ensure it is level in the water. However, this would only apply to very granular ballast material such as sand. The term is more likely to have arisen due to the transition from sail to power. The advent of engines within the hull of a ship caused severe vibration. Such vibration would be aggravated by uneven running and different sea conditions. A new ship had many fixtures and fittings throughout its accommodation and work spaces. As the maiden voyage progressed, these would become loose, and in many cases fall to the deck (shaken down). For this reason, it was common for the shipyard to send a 'shake-down' team with the ship on her maiden voyage. These men would be specialists equipped with the proper tools and spares to relocate or replace any displaced fixtures or fittings. Availability A vessel is typically not committed to any timetables or tasks until it completes its shakedown cruise. As such, problems detected during the shakedown cruise can be fixed at minimal cost. While the ship is assigned to the industrial activity for this purpose, this period is known as an \\"availability\\". In the US Navy, the typical length of an availability is 45 to 120 days, and per regulation, must be completed no more than eleven months after the month the ship was first delivered. This is also known as a \\"post-shakedown availability\\". Famous examples The USS Triton, a nuclear-powered radar picket submarine, was the first vessel to execute a submerged circumnavigation of Earth while on its shakedown cruise in early 1960. Triton is the only U.S. Navy ship to receive a Presidential Unit Citation for its shakedown cruise.

The mine's case consisted of a short cylinder with the entire top surface being used as a pressure plate. The mine was normally painted olive drab and was broadly similar to the earlier, smaller, TM-41 mine. The earlier TM-41 was used widely between 1941 and 1942, but production was discontinued because of the lack of metal available to Soviet industry. By 1944 the situation had improved and production of metal mines resumed. The TM-44 is similar to the earlier mine, weighing more with a larger charge. 140 to 260 kilograms of pressure on the top pressure plate resulted in it bending downwards and pressing on the MV-5 fuze. One to three kilograms of pressure on the head of the fuze was sufficient to activate it. The fuze's lock balls are forced out of position by the pressure, releasing a striker, which triggers a detonator, then a booster and then the mine's main charge. The mine was used with anti-handling devices. Production of the mine ceased in 1946 with the adoption of the TM-46 mine, which was modelled on German Tellermine designs. The mine was prone to rusting, exposing the MV-5 fuze which could be triggered by as little as 1 to 3 kilograms of pressure. It is found in Yemen.

Kenilworth: First Fifty Years, https://archive.org/details/kenilworthfirstf00kenirich. Within the next decade, due to the opening of the fee-free Joseph Sears School, Cook moved his school to the present site today in Winnetka. Shortly after, the school reimagined itself as the Girton School For Girls.The Girton School for Girls yearbook, The Girtonian, 1907. https://archive.org/details/thegirtonian1907 The school built three more buildings on what was then known as the Garland Estate, but by 1918-19 the school began to encounter funding difficulties. A group of parents and alumni from the Girton School and local area came together in 1919 and chose Perry Dunlap Smith to found the North Shore Country Day School for girls and boys of all ages. With the popularity of the Country Day School movement, this was seen as the next logical step for the school. The school continues to have no class rankings and no academic awards. As it became clear the Country Day school would outlast its time as a traditional school, the founder and first headmaster Perry Dunlap Smith hired Chicago area architect Edwin H. Clark to redesign the school grounds.Edwin H. Clark designed many buildings in Chicago and its North Shore suburbs, including Winnetka Village Hall, Plaza del Lago in Wilmette, the Lincoln Park Zoo Reptile House, and the Chicago Zoological Park along with many private residences. http://digital- libraries.saic.edu/cdm/ref/collection/findingaids/id/14436 The school was one of 27 schools selected from a group of 250 candidate schools in the U.S. chosen in 1933 for the Eight-Year Study: alternative admission standards for admission to 200 selective colleges.

At Hornsby Shire Council he established and led the successful Bushland Management, Heritage, Drainage and Agenda 21 Committees. He also led the development of the Hornsby Shire Housing Strategy and chaired both the National Parks and Wildlife Service Northern Sydney Advisory Committee and Lane Cove State Recreation Area Trust.

Sydney Morning Herald, 29 July 1993. Pringle did not stand for re-election as mayor in 1993, and instead contested preselection for the safe electoral district of Northcott for the New South Wales State Election, 1995, losing to then State Director and subsequently Premier Barry O'Farrell.Brown, Elizabeth. \\"North's Mayors\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 23 September 1993.\\"Six line up for Northcott Lib preselection\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 26 January 1995.

The Sun-Herald, 15 March 2003. Parliament Pringle was elected Member for Hawkesbury at the general election held on 22 March 2003 and held the seat until the next general election held on 2 March 2007. Pringle showcased some of the products of his electorate through the Hawkesbury Harvest (local produce and products) which were displayed in the foyer of parliament during his inaugural speech. Pringle particularly focused on the issues of planning, transport education and the environment. He was the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Transport in 2006 and a member of the Statuary Public Works, Lane Cove Tunnel Inquiry and Valuer General's Committees. He actively supported local businesses and groups and was heavily involved in community activities, raising many local issues in Parliament. Though he held Christian beliefs, and attended the same parliamentary prayer group as hard-right factional power-broker David Clarke, he was always aligned with the party's moderate faction.Benson, Simon. \\"Pringle's pop at the party was just a parting shot\\". The Daily Telegraph, 18 October 2006. This allegiance began threatening his career as early as 2005, only two years into his term, when reports emerged that the hard-right was engaging in branch stacking in Hawkesbury as a prelude to a possible preselection challenge.Murphy, Damien and Noonan, Gerard. \\"Lib anger over guns flashed at meeting\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 18 April 2005. Several months later, in the wake of the resignation of moderate Opposition Leader John Brogden (politician), Pringle was one of a number of MPs who reportedly had their preselection threatened if they did not vote for the hard-right's preferred candidate, Peter Debnam, as Brogden's replacement, a campaign which ultimately sparked the withdrawal of Debnam's only opponent Barry O'Farrel from the race.Clennell, Andrew and Wainwright, Robert. \\"Poisoned chalice was easy to refuse\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 1 September 2005. A State Electorate boundary redistribution altered the balance between moderate and right branches. The tensions from the previous year were confirmed when, on 2 September 2006, Australian politician Ray Williams, a Baulkham Hills Shire Councillor backed by the hard-right faction, challenged Pringle.Clennell, Andrew. \\"MP facing axe may go it alone\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 5 September 2006. This came in the wake of reports that numbers in one branch in Pringle's electorate had swelled from 17 to 500 (with none actually living in the suburb) due to an influx of Lebanese Australian members, and public allegations by Howard Crawford, party president for the nearby electoral district of Londonderry that a campaign of \\"branch-stacking, malpractice and political promises\\" was being used to undermine Pringle.Clennell, Andrew. \\"Corruption focus switches to Libs\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 17 August 2006.Norington, Brad and Salusinzsky, Imre. \\"Land deals in Lib poll stack, Debnam told\\". The Australian, 16 August 2006. Reports also emerged during the campaign that Williams had claimed that he could secure a $100,000 donation to the party from a property development company if he were elected, which later sparked controversy and an enforced veto of the move from party leader Peter Debnam.Salusinzsky, Imre. \\"Quitting Lib blasts the party\\". The Australian, 18 October 2006. Pringle was endorsed by Debnam to remain as a member of parliament. Although Debnam's intervention had saved numerous sitting members under attack over the previous year, it was not enough to save Pringle, who was defeated by Williams on 15 October. It was subsequently reported that Pringle had obtained approximately 50% of the local branch vote in spite of the branch stacking, but had been soundly defeated by the votes of the hard right-dominated state council and state executive.Mitchell, Alex. \\"Sitting MP given boot by hard right\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 15 October 2006. Pringle responded to news of his preselection defeat by declaring \\"betrayal and disgust\\" at what had occurred, labeling Debnam either \\"lying or impotent\\".Moran, Susannah. \\"Shafted by the right, says ousted Liberal\\". Australian Financial Review, 16 October 2006.Clennell, Andrew. \\"Debnam lying or impotent - endorsed MP\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 16 October 2006. He resigned from the Liberal Party during Question Time in Parliament on 17 October, announcing his intention to serve out his term as an independent, and recontest his seat as an independent. The government used its numbers to suspend standing orders so Pringle could speak at a time of maximum coverage, and in an explosive attack Pringle criticized Clarke, Debnam and the Liberal Party, claiming that the party was being controlled by \\"an exclusive sect\\" - referring to Clarke's membership of Opus Dei - labelling Clarke \\"the Godfather\\", and calling the preselection \\"an absolute rort\\". He further accused the party of being preoccupied with issues such as homosexuality and drug injecting rooms, instead of the real issues of health, transport, education and the environment and claimed that it \\"does not deserve to govern\\".Benson, Simon. \\"Spitting chips, Pringle quits\\".

He batted and threw right-handed. Today Noles is a born-again Christian and works for the Philadelphia Phillies. Noles attended Harding University High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was selected in the 4th round (84th overall) in the 1975 June amateur baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. Noles was an effective relief pitcher for the Phillies' 1980 World Series championship team. In Game 4 of that series, Noles came on in relief of Larry Christenson in the first inning with only one out and the Phillies down 4‚Äì0 to the Kansas City Royals. Noles pitched the next 4 innings and gave up another run, but is most remembered for throwing a fastball under George Brett's chin in the fourth inning that prompted a warning by the umpires to both teams. Brett struck out in the at-bat and had only three singles and one RBI the remainder of the series. The brushback incident is looked upon as the turning point in that series for the Phillies. Before the 1982 season, Noles was traded along with Keith Moreland to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Krukow and cash. Noles had an effective season as a starter in 1982, going 10‚Äì13. In early 1983, however, Noles' alcohol problems began to surface. He and a Cubs teammate drunkenly assaulted a police officer after a game and Noles severely injured his left knee. Noles spent 16 days in jail, was forced to enter alcohol rehabilitation, and was forced to pay a substantial amount of his baseball earnings in an ensuing civil suit. Noles reports that he has been sober since April 9, 1983, the date of the incident. In 1987, Noles became one of only four players in history to be \\"traded for himself\\" (Harry Chiti, Brad Gulden, and John McDonald are the other three). Noles was traded from the Cubs to the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later. 33 days later, the teams were unable to agree on what player Chicago would receive, and so Noles was shipped back to the Cubs, completing a deal in which he was traded for himself.

Bus service began on November 3, 1993, with a network of four routes serving the two cities and no fares. The cities of Anacortes, La Conner, and Sedro-Wollley were annexed into the Skagit Transit service area in 1994, followed by Bayview and Concrete in 1995. Service was cut after the passage of Initiative 695 in 2000, and voters rejected a sales tax increase to support restored service. Skagit Transit began operating inter-county routes to Island and Whatcom counties in 2005, and expanded with a Mount Vernon‚ÄìEverett commuter route in 2006 part- funded by Island Transit and the state government. The agency also took ownership of Skagit Station in Mount Vernon, which is served by Amtrak Cascades and Island Transit. A 0.2 percent sales tax increase was approved by voters in the November 2008 election, allowing for expanded service. Facilities =Skagit Station= :Address: 105 E.

The Legislative Assembly of Tonga was due to adjourn for the year and despite promises of action, had done little to advance democracy in the government. A mixed crowd of democracy advocates took to the streets in protest. The riots saw a number of cases of robbery, looting, vehicle theft, arson and various property damage. Targets of riots Riots broke out around 3:30 pm TOT as rioters threw stones, broke windows, and looted. By about 6:00 pm, rioters started setting buildings on fire. The first targets of the rioters were government buildings. Then they attacked enterprises, including some that were leased to ANZ Bank and those owned by the Prime Minister Feleti Sevele. A private shop selling mobile telephones and advertising for Tonf√∂n (part of the Shoreline Group of Companies owned, at the time, by the royal family) was next. Rioters also attacked and burned the main office of the Shoreline Group of Companies, which was located one kilometer away from the small central business district. Several of the larger Chinese shops were targeted for looting and burning. Other shops, including one owned by ethnic Indians, were burned as well, but it is not clear if they were intentionally set on fire or caught fire from surrounding buildings. Looters walking At about 6:00 PM TOT rioters torched the Royal Pacific hotel (owned by the Shoreline Group of Companies). The hotel was located on one of the main roads into the city. There are many commercial buildings on the thoroughfare, and the fire spread to some of those buildings as well. According to an article in Tonga Now, normally law-abiding Tongans of both sexes and all ages were participating avidly in the looting. However, some photos would seem to indicate that the car-tipping and arson were the work of young men. This conception would be reinforced after a destroyed Chinese shop was vandalized with graffiti. At nightfall, the police and the Tonga Defence Services regained control of the central business district and were turning away anyone who tried to enter. Aftermath Estimates of the damage varied. Some estimates said that 60 to 80% of the central business district was destroyed. The day after, a journalist under the watchful eye of the army =17 November= It was announced that eight bodies had been found in charred ruins. Since most of the employees of the affected businesses managed to reach safety, news reports speculated that the dead were likely looters. It is not clear if the deceased have been identified or if identified, when their names will be released. The Tongan government declared a state of emergency. Only firefighters, police, utility workers, etc. were allowed inside a perimeter defined by Vuna road, Alipate road, Mateialona road, and Tupoulahi road. Residents of that area could enter only after being searched. For the next month, gatherings of more than five persons were illegal in that area. Emergency laws gave security forces the right to stop and search people without a warrant. The Tongan government promised reform. Popular elections were held in 2008, in which a majority of the Legislative Assembly were elected by popular vote. The Chinese embassy chartered an airplane to evacuate Chinese nationals. =18 November= 110 soldiers and 44 police officers from Australia and New Zealand arrived to help the local police to establish order. The New Zealand army was to be in charge of airport security and the police were to protect the High Commission. The Australian contingent from the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment were to assist and relieve exhausted Tongan police. =19 November= A leader of the Tongan pro-democracy movement, MP 'Akilisi Pohiva, has criticised the intervention of Australian and New Zealand peacekeepers following the riots. =20 November= Some businesses had temporarily relocated to the suburbs. Some looted items were returned. Police were guarding the telecommunications center and investigating mobile call logs. According to the Matangi Tonga newspaper, twenty-six arrests had been made and the number of deaths had been revised down to six. =22 November= Nuku ªalofa was by now largely peaceful. The town center was still cordoned off and heavily patrolled, but local shop owners and the like could easily get permission to enter the restricted area. Some Chinese shops which escaped damage were now open again. Major shops and banks, however, were still operating from temporary locations in the suburbs. =1 December= Peace was believed to be restored and foreign forces began leaving. The forbidden area in town was reduced. Police had made 571 arrests.Radio Tonga news and = 2007 = The first business to rebuild and reopen was the Fung Shin supermarket, which opened in new premises on 19 December 2007. = 2008 = In November 2008, rebuilding began with an anticipated three years of work for the infrastructure to be complete. Roads, footpaths, drainage and more were planned by Minister Paul Karalus. Funding was provided by low-interest Chinese government loans amounting to $US55 million. = 2018 = In July 2018, Tonga was expected to begin the repayments that ended up being US$100 million+ from the Chinese government. The commitment to begin this process was made by 'Akilisi Pohiva. = Maintaining the state of emergency = In late January 2008, the Tongan authorities renewed a Proclamation of Public Order for the sixteenth month running, a lingering aftermath of the riots. The statement reads: \\"It is hereby proclaimed that there continues to exist a state of danger\\" in central Nuku ªalofa. According to the Proclamation, the area will remain \\"controlled and maintained by the Tonga Police Force and Tonga Defence Services for the sole purpose of maintaining public order for all people of the country\\".\\"PM renews public order proclamation for 16th month\\" , Matangi Tonga, 30 January 2008 Tongan information minister Afualo Matoto announced that the state of emergency would probably be maintained for another three months (i.e., until the end of April). This was criticised by Tongan pro-democracy advocate Akilisi Pohiva: \\"I don‚Äôt see any reason for government to continue to hold on to the emergency power.\\" The state of emergency was lifted in August 2008. Member of Parliament 'Akilisi Pohiva noted that the government had probably chosen to wait until after the coronation of King George Tupou V to put an end to it. It was, however, re-imposed in September, despite the objections of pro-democracy members of Parliament.\\"Tongan PM re-imposes emergency regulations\\", ABC Radio Australia, 10 September 2008 Operation Kaliloa A joint investigation into the riots by the Tonga police, Australian Federal Police and New Zealand Police, codenamed Operation Kaliloa, began. Tongan MP and former Police Minister Clive Edwards claims that Tongan soldiers have beaten hundreds of people and then refused them treatment for their injuries. Edwards claims he was attacked by soldiers himself. An official of the Tongan Defence Force said there was no evidence to back up Edwards' claims. He would not give his name. On 2 February 2007, Edwards was arrested and charged with two counts of sedition arising from the riots. The state of emergency declared on 17 November 2006 was extended several times. It was finally ended in January 2011 once the new Prime Minister took office following the 2010 election.

Baalu. This event marked the first incident in the history of Independent India that a Central Cabinet Minister was arrested. The incident began when the seventy-eight-year-old former Chief Minister was taken from his residence. Within hours, images of the arrest were broadcast on Sun TV and other network stations. Footage shown on Jaya TV saw him continuously resist arrest.  Background  The First Information Report (FIR) was based on a complaint lodged by Chennai Corporation Commissioner J. C. T. Acharyalu on 29 June 2001. Mr. Acharyalu became Corporation Commissioner following the May 2001 assembly elections held by the Jayalalitha Government. He had been kept under suspension by the Karunanidhi Government. The complaint related to alleged losses of in the construction of the mini-flyovers in the city of Chennai. The police complaint was lodged on Friday, 29 June at 9:00 pm, and the arrest took place a few hours after midnight. Because there was, allegedly, little time to conduct an investigation, Arun Jaitley, Union Law Minister wrote that \\"the initial impression appears to be that personal agenda is being given preference over the rule of the law.\\"  Arrest  Reports indicate that at 1:30 am on 30 June, Karunanidhi was asleep in the upstairs bedroom of his home when the police broke open the door and asked Karunanidhi to get dressed. The police cut the telephone lines to the house. A television clip showed Karunanidhi falling down and being shoved, pushed, beaten and lifted by police officers in the house. Murasoli Maran, who went to rescue him, was also attacked and arrested when he resisted the arrest of the ex- chief minister. Maran, who was sick from his heart with a pacemaker, was admitted to Apollo Hospital after his arrest. T.R.Balu and thousands of DMK cadres were arrested. M.K.Stalin surrendered before a Magistrate. Prime Minister Vajpayee condemned the arrest and demanded a report from chief secretary and Governor. The arrest was condemned by many groups across the political spectrum including both human rights groups and the Indian National Congress, otherwise known as a political ally of the AIADMK.  Court finds fault with the arrest  The court found several faults with the police's handling of the situation: # A judge found fault with Chennai Corporation Commissioner Acharyalu for making a hasty complaint. They alleged that because Acharyalu had been appointed to his post only a week earlier, he could not have known what had happened between 1998 and 2000. At that time a traffic improvement committee and a high-level steering committee were set up to ease traffic and the construction of flyovers was given to contractors. He could not have known how the accused received financial benefits. # Acharyalu made the complaint directly to CB-CID and not through the chief secretary, as is the normal procedure. # Acharyalu had not consulted the engineers nor council members involved in the project before making a complaint. # The judge wanted the Special Public Prosecutor, Mr. A. Raghunathan, to pinpoint who was the main accused. To the surprise of the judge, Mr. A. Raghunathan could not pinpoint the main accused. # The judge criticized the fact that no investigation was done apart from Acharyalu's complaint and a few files with the corporation. # The Judge disapproved of the manner in which the complaint was made, the FIR registered and the arrests carried out. # Investigating officer, P. Padmanabhan, said that none of the accused (including Karunanidhi and the other 14), received any pecuniary benefits. This raised questions about the motive of the FIR. # The judge was surprised that the main accused could not be pinpointed; that the accused received no benefit; and that no investigation was done prior to the arrest, all leading to his questioning the motive of the arrest. # The judge further noted that the way the complaint was lodged and FIR registered without examining witnesses shows that the only motive was to arrest some people. The judge suggested that this was an abuse of power. # The court wondered why, in a normal corruption case, a First Information Report would be filed, the case investigated, a charge sheet would be made and a court would decide whether to give bail to the accused or not. In this case, the FIR was filed at night and arrests were made at midnight. The accused were those leaders who were not likely to abscond. The court asked why these procedures were not followed.  Charge sheet  The charge-sheet was filed only after 4 years, in 2005. This raised questions as to the conduct of the government.

The bridge is owned by Transport for NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge is also known as the Victoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000. Designed by Percy Allan and opened on 7 October 1897, Victoria Bridge employs Allan trusses and was built by C. J. Ford of Sydney. It features the tallest trestles in New South Wales, and is one of the oldest surviving bridges of its type. It is named after Queen Victoria, and is classified by the National Trust. Victoria Bridge is wide enough for a pedestrian walkway and one lane of traffic and is long. The bridge has a height limit of . The bridge is listed by the Engineers Institute as historically significant.  History  =Picton= The town of Picton was named by Major Antill after Sir Thomas Picton in 1841. The location was previously known as \\"Stonequarry\\". The Duke of Wellington described Picton as a \\"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\\" but very capable. He was \\"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the Battle of Waterloo and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, Hanover Square in London. In 1859 Picton was re- interred in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.Wheeldon, 2015, 3. =Victoria Bridge= Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the NSW Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Timber Allan trusses were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next thirty years. Percy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the NSW Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\".  Description  The Victoria Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss spans, each of . There are no approach spans. The overall length of the bridge is . The super structure is supported by timber trestles which carry a single-lane carriageway with a minimum width of and a footpath. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge and an Armco barrier protects pedestrians from vehicular traffic. = Condition = As at 15 June 2005, fair and intact.  Heritage listing  As at 15 June 2005, completed in 1897, the Victoria bridge is an early example of an Allan type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in fair condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were twenty per cent cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50 per cent more load, and were easier to maintain. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road. bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Victoria bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Victoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Victoria bridge is valued by the people of the Picton district. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare - In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Representative of Allan truss bridges.

Early life and career Frank Anderson grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana. While a student at Shortridge High School, he was a member of the wrestling team, and was inducted into the IHSWCA Hall of Fame in 1990. Following graduation from high school in 1956, he enlisted in the United States Navy Shore Patrol, serving until 1959. From 1961 to 1965, he served as a Patrol Deputy in the Marion County Sheriff's Office. From 1965 to 1977, he served in the United States Marshals Service, serving first as a Deputy Marshal, and later as an inspector and security specialist. During his tenure with the U.S. Marshals Service, he helped create and later directed the Federal Witness Protection Program. In 1977, he was appointed as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Indiana, becoming the top federal law enforcement official for over half the state, serving in that post until 1981. Following a brief stint in the private sector, he was appointed as a District Director for the Federal Protective Service, where he was in charge of providing security in federal facilities in Indiana, Minnesota, and parts of Illinois and Wisconsin from 1983 to 1994. He was reappointed as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Indiana, serving from 1994 to 2001. In that capacity, he oversaw the federal government seizure of the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, winning praise for his peaceful handling of the standoff.

Following his reelection as Sheriff, his duties were expanded to include oversight of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in accordance with legislation signed by Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson. Following Peterson's defeat for reelection in November, 2007, the new mayor, Greg Ballard announced that he would fulfill a campaign promise to remove the Sheriff as statutory head of the Police Department and put it under the Mayor's authority within the Department of Public Safety. Following implementation of Ballard's proposal in February, 2008, Anderson's role as Sheriff was reduced to administration of the county jail, overseeing security for City-County government buildings, and administrative duties including tax collection and serving legal papers, with general law enforcement services for the County remaining the under the jurisdiction of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department which resulted in Anderson becoming the only Sheriff in the state of Indiana without territory to protect. =Salary controversy= Sheriff Anderson's annual compensation was more than that of the Governor of Indiana or the Mayor of Indianapolis. Sheriff Anderson turned down a $50,000 per year raise when he came under public scrutiny after an Indianapolis Star article detailed his 2005 annual base pay as $102,000 in addition to $268,000 from a portion of fees collected from tax warrants, for total compensation of $370,000, nearly that of the President of the United States.

It is also a surface of finite topology, which means that it can be formed by puncturing a compact surface. Topologically, it is a thrice-punctured torus. Until its discovery, the plane, helicoid and the catenoid were believed to be the only embedded minimal surfaces that could be formed by puncturing a compact surface. The Costa surface evolves from a torus, which is deformed until the planar end becomes catenoidal. Defining these surfaces on rectangular tori of arbitrary dimensions yields the Costa surface. Its discovery triggered research and discovery into several new surfaces and open conjectures in topology. The Costa surface can be described using the Weierstrass zeta and the Weierstrass elliptic functions. References * Ph.D. Thesis, IMPA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. * Bol. Soc. Bras.

Early years Theodore was born in New York City on January 9, 1943, his father, John, was a sculptor and art professor at The Horace Mann School. His mother, Nenette Charisse was a renowned ballet instructor and member of a Vaudeville dancing company.Obituary: Nenette Charisse, 2001, Dance Magazine, Inc Charisse‚Äôs second husband was Robert Tucker, a Tony-nominated choreographer, and the couple raised Theodore from early childhood. As a child, Theodore appeared as ‚ÄúNibs‚Äù in NBC‚Äôs 1955 broadcast of Peter Pan starring Mary Martin. He graduated from The Browning School on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper East Side. In 1962, Theodore married Lee Becker, the Tony-nominated dancer and choreographer and founder of The American DanceMachine. According to his own accounts, Theodore supplemented his work as an abstract painter by serving as an independent contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency while still a teenager in the early 1960s. For several years, he supposedly performed a number of dangerous covert missions for the CIA, many of which, if true, required him to carry and use handguns. His supposed experience sparked an interest in creating special holsters for the concealment of weapons. ‚ÄúI was working for Uncle Sam as a freedom fighter until Communism imploded on itself,‚Äù Theodore said. In 1966, at the age of 23, Theodore founded Seventrees Ltd., a company that designed and produced gun holsters for professionals who had the need to conceal weapons yet access them quickly. Demand among undercover investigators and intelligence agents grew quickly for his innovative designs and Seventrees was soon awarded several contracts from a variety of U.S. agencies. The growing popularity of the holsters inspired many imitations by other manufacturers. Even the company‚Äôs slogan ‚ÄúUnseen in the Best Places‚Äù was copied by at least one competitor. By day, Theodore and his team were manufacturing customized gun holsters, while by night, Seventrees‚Äô West 39th Street offices were transformed into a clandestine weapons manufacturing operation, designing special classified concealment weapons for government agencies through a sister company, Armament Systems Procedures Corporation (ASP). Excerpt from Theodore's Seventrees holster catalogue 1969: the SCP holster  Invention of the ASP  One of ASP‚Äôs first products was a Theodore-designed handgun bearing the name of the company. The ASP, based on the Smith & Wesson Model 39 semi-automatic pistol, featured many innovations: ‚Äúclear grips‚Äù‚Äîwhich enabled the user to see the number of unfired rounds remaining; the ‚Äúguttersnipe‚Äù‚Äîa gun sight designed for close range combat; and a ‚Äúforefinger grip‚Äù‚Äîtoday a standard feature on the trigger guard of many modern handguns. Theodore‚Äôs ASP was the first successful service caliber handgun in pocket pistol size. Its arrival inspired a cottage industry of gunsmiths producing unauthorized versions of the weapon, in addition to the authorized factory version from Theodore's ASP Inc.\\"Reportedly, about 3,000 were made through the 1980s\\" , 2007, Jim Supica, Richard Nahas ,F+W Media, Inc, \\"Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson\\" In 1970, the ASP was featured in The Handgun, by Glaswegian gun expert Geoffrey Boothroyd. Boothroyd, the inspiration for ‚ÄúQ,‚Äù the technologically inventive character who outfitted James Bond with his lifesaving gadgets, would, in turn, later inspire Ian Fleming‚Äôs successor, John Gardner, to replace Bond‚Äôs renowned Walther PPK as 007‚Äôs weapon of choice. Beginning with 1984‚Äôs Role of Honor, the ASP would go on to be featured in 11 James Bond novels. James Bond expert James McMahon would later write: ‚ÄúIf Bond were a gun, he'd be the ASP. Dark, deadly, perfectly suited to his mission.‚Äù  The Quell system  In 1980, Theodore formed Techpak, a company created to market a combat handgun shooting technique he had developed called ‚ÄúQuell.‚Äù The Quell system included a realistic depiction of close quarter combat, a shooting stance, as well as a target designed to enhance the shooter‚Äôs understanding of the Quell Zone, the area, that when struck, caused the instant cessation of movement by a hostile opponent. Quell drew upon Theodore‚Äôs real-life experience in close quarter combat and the concept of a \\"Quell stop\\" became standard training for many police departments and special agencies throughout the world. Through Quell, he sought to educate weapons professionals about the stark reality of close combat with handguns. ‚ÄúFrom the movies we have learned to expect that when someone is shot in the arm, he reacts immediately by grabbing it with his free hand, wincing, and maybe uttering an ‚ÄòUnh!‚Äô When he is shot in the chest, a spot of blood appears and he is thrown backwards, usually with arms flailing, to land motionless and silent.‚Äù Theodore wrote in 1985, ‚ÄúThe truth is that no bullet from a sidearm, no matter what the caliber, will bowl a man over.‚Äù He described this ‚Äúknock-down power‚Äù as ‚Äúthe figment of the collective imagination of Hollywood screenwriters.‚Äù Personal life Theodore's wife Lee died in 1987. Theodore died November 16, 2006 at St. Luke‚Äôs hospital in Manhattan. The cause of death was complications resulting from a longstanding and debilitating bout with multiple sclerosis. He is survived by his sons, Ali and Said Theodore and Paris Kain. Kain, a filmmaker, is currently producing a documentary based on the life of his late father.

Maejima founded the Japanese postal service, and is known as , or \\"Father of the Postal System\\".  Early life  Maejima was born as Ueno Fusagor≈ç, in the village of Shimoikebe, Echigo Province (present-day the city of J≈çetsu, Niigata Prefecture). In 1866 he was adopted into the Maejima family. He was sent to Edo to study rangaku, medical science and English. In the Bakumatsu period he was considered a radical reformer and proponent of westernization. In 1866, he submitted an unsolicited proposal to sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu that Japan abolish the use of kanji (Chinese characters) in its writing system. In 1868, shortly after the Meiji Restoration, he also proposed to ≈åkubo Toshimichi that the capital of Japan be moved from Kyoto to Edo.  Meiji bureaucrat  ≈åkubo liked the gall of the upstart Maejima, and appointed him to the new Minbu-sh≈ç (Ministry for Popular Affairs) in the new Meiji government, where his outspoken attitude caught the attention of It≈ç Hirobumi and ≈åkuma Shigenobu. He was sent to Great Britain in 1870 to study the workings of the General Post Office, and upon his return to Japan in 1871, his proposals for the creation of a similar system in Japan were quickly approved. The Japanese post office began operation in April 1871 with a daily service linking Tokyo with Osaka, with 65 post offices in between. Maejima personally coined the Japanese word for postage stamp (kitte). To make the system self-supporting, and to extend the modern economic system into the Japanese countryside, Maejima also created a system of postal savings banks in 1874. This system expanded to include money orders in 1875. In 1874, Maejima hired a foreign advisor, Samuel M. Bryan, to negotiate a postal treaty with the United States, and to assist in the admission of Japan into the Universal Postal Union in 1877. In 1878, Maejima was appointed to the Genr≈çin, and in 1879, he was appointed Vice Minister for Home Affairs. By the time Maejima retired in 1881, the Japanese postal system had expanded to 5,099 post offices and was continuing to grow.  Occupations  While establishing the postal system, Maejima somehow also found time to start his own newspaper in 1872. The Yubin Hochi Shimbun was renamed the Hochi Shimbun in 1894, and was merged with the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1942. Not content with two careers, Maejima also found time to assist ≈åkuma Shigenobu in establishing the Tokyo Semmon Gakk≈ç in 1882, of which he served as principal from 1886 to 1890. The school was renamed Waseda University in 1902. Seeing the potential for profit in the rapidly expanding railroad network in Japan, in 1886 Maejima established the Kansai Railroad Company in Osaka. He followed in this career by establishing a second railroad company, the Hokuetsu Railway connecting Niigata with Naoetsu in 1894. Meanwhile. Maejima and Okuma helped establish the Rikken Kaishint≈ç political party. He was appointed as Vice Minister of Communications from 1888 to 1891, during which time he established Japan's state-owned telephone service. Ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system in 1902, he served as a member of the House of Peers from 1904 to 1910. He died in 1919 at his summer cottage in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. As one would expect, he has been honored on several Japanese postage stamps. Notes  References  * Cobbing, Andrew. (1989).

Writing became his voice and a means of protest. It provided an avenue to express himself and his beliefs. Many times, he has tried to step away from his usual fight against injustice and write about different unrelated topics. Nevertheless, he has been unable to and stick to writing to reject injustice, oppression, and exploitation.  Cordite publishing company  Cordite Books is a new publishing company jointly owned by Habila and Parr√©sia Publishers.\\"Helon Habila to Edit Cordite Books\\", Parr√©sia, 7 August 2013. Their first project was to make a call for submissions in 2013 for quality crime fiction manuscripts, the best to receive US$1,000 and a publishing deal with distribution across the continent.\\"Cordite Books: Call for Submissions\\", Parr√©sia, 10 August 2013. In his early days, Habila grew up reading Nigerian books in Hausa and then Macmillan's Pacesetters series, which was popular pan-African fiction mostly about crime in urban areas. This resonated with the actual happenings in cities where there is always a fight for power, a struggle to be important and issues of class. This setting has been a recurring scene in his life. With this interest in crime fiction, Helon noticed a gap in the market as a lot of books in Nigeria were by serious literary writers such as Chinua Achebe. After that you would only find non-fiction, religious or motivational books. There was hardly any middle ground for entertainment books and that is where Cordite Books fills the gap for crime fiction.

It implements a method inspired by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (protein NMR), termed satisfaction of spatial restraints, by which a set of geometrical criteria are used to create a probability density function for the location of each atom in the protein. The method relies on an input sequence alignment between the target amino acid sequence to be modeled and a template protein which structure has been solved. The program also incorporates limited functions for ab initio structure prediction of loop regions of proteins, which are often highly variable even among homologous proteins and thus difficult to predict by homology modeling. Modeller was originally written and is currently maintained by Andrej Sali at the University of California, San Francisco. It runs on the operating systems Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is freeware for academic use. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and commercial versions are distributed by Accelrys.

Archbishop of Quito, he was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII, the first Ecuadorian to be admitted to the College of Cardinals. After finishing his studies at the Conciliar Seminary in Quito, Carlos Mar√≠a moved to the prestigious Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned doctorates in theology and canon law. He was ordained a priest on 19 December 1896, served as Professor of dogmatic theology at the Seminary where he had been a student and was for a time pastor in Pelileo. Pope Pius X appointed him Bishop of Loja on 30 December 1911 and de la Torre worked as a parish priest throughout this period. Despite his unusually youthful appointment as a bishop, it took a long time for him to advance further: he was only transferred to the more important diocese of Guayaquil in 1926 and promoted to Archbishop of Quito at the age of fifty-eight in 1933. However, his ability was recognised eventually after World War II by Pope Pius XII in 1946 when he became Assistant at the Pontifical Throne, and gradually over the next decade his long period of service to the Church was recognised though his elevation to the cardinalate at the advanced age of seventy-eight in January 1953 (when he had already been a bishop for forty years). He was also decorated by the Spanish government with the Cruz of Alfonso X el Sabio at the same time and in the following years he began addressing the issue of extreme social inequality in Latin America and the problem of the evangelical inroads that were just beginning to emerge in Latin America. Cardinal de la Torre participated in the conclave of 1958 but his efforts to ameliorate social inequality in Latin America were rapidly defeated by his exceedingly advanced age. By 1962, his health was so poor that he could, at the age of eighty-nine, attend neither any of the sessions for Vatican II nor the 1963 conclave. He was the first cardinal not to attend a conclave for health reasons since Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠n de Herrera y de la Iglesia and Giuseppe Prisco in 1922. He also ordered the commencement of the cause of beatification and canonization of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, President of Ecuador during the nineteenth century. Cardinal de la Torre died in 1968 at the age of 94 and was buried in the metropolitan cathedral of Quito. One of his major contributions to Ecuadorian education was his founding of the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Ecuador.

In order to limit United States involvement in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, PDD-25 created a \\"vital national interests test\\" to evaluate cases: this test limited United States involvement to those operations that 1) had US military officers in control of US troops, 2) a mission that was in the best interests of the US government, and 3) had popular domestic support for the operation. Quynh-Nhu Vuong (2003), \\"U.S. Peacekeeping and Nation-Building: The Evolution of Self-Interested Multilateralism\\", Berkeley Journal of International Law, 21 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 804, pp. 812-14 The order set the goal of reducing US financial commitment to such operations from 31.7% in 1994 to around 25% in 1996. PDD-25 was drafted based on the premise that, in the post-Cold War era, new threats to the United States would eventually emerge. The directive suggested that the United States required a military that would be able to win wars unilaterally. The directive was opposed to a standing United Nations army and prevented the earmarking of a specific number of US troops to be available to the United Nations international community.  Criticism of the order  Commentators suggested the Clinton administration issued the order to counter the increasing political pressure and negative press related to the failure of the UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia. Eighteen American soldiers in the UN Operation were killed in 1993 in the Battle of Mogadishu during UNOSOM II.Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War (1999) PDD 25 was used by the government as the legal basis for deploying American soldiers into Macedonia in 1993-1999, Operation Able Sentry.Military Ops, Global Security Members of Congress were not allowed to see PDD 25. The State Department said that, as of 2009, the document was declassified. The Clinton Library is the repository of this document. The full text of PDD 25 can be found at on the Clinton Library website. The summary text is available at the website of the Federation of American Scientists. = Rwandan Genocide = The United States analysis of its vital interests test resulted in its deciding against participating in the UN peacekeeping operation proposed to end the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Richard A Clarke, chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group at the National Security Council, also recommended to Madeleine Albright, then US Ambassador to the United Nations, that the UN withdraw its peacekeeping forces from the country during that crisis.

P. Periyasaamy Thooran (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æö‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Æø ‡Æ§‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Æ©‡Øç) (26 September 1908 ‚Äì 20 January 1987) was a patriot, Tamil poet, teacher, and composer of Carnatic music. Early life Periyasamy was born to K.A. Palanivelappa Gounder and Paavaathal on 26 September 1908 at Manjakattuvalasu, near Modakurichi, in the Erode district of India. He was greatly influenced and inspired by the firebrand poet and revolutionary Subramania Bharathiyar, and Mahatma Gandhi. As a university student, he published an underground monthly magazine called Pithan containing incendiary articles that spoke out against the erstwhile British administration, in support of the Indian Independence Movement. This magazine was printed by K. M. Ramaswamy Gounder MLA in Gobichettipalayam initially. He also wrote poems and short stories during this period, adopting the pen name Thooran. He declined to sit for the final Bachelor of Arts examination, in protest of the execution of Bhagat Singh. Periyasamy gained his Bachelor of Arts degree (in Mathematics with a Minor in Astronomy) and a L.T. (Licentiate in Teaching) later. Periyasamy's background in Science would prove to be instrumental in helping him complete the Tamil Encyclopedia project, work on which began in 1947. He held that terms pertaining to science and technology were an integral part of the Tamil language. Literary career A prolific writer, he composed over six hundred songs on national, spiritual and moral issues. He wrote 'a poem a day' for several years after his daily poojas. He became popular and the melody queens N. C. Vasanthakokilam and D. K. Pattammal always included his works in their concerts. A man with noble ideals, Thooran is an acknowledged poet and composer. Analogous to Tyagaraja's 'Santhamulekha, Soukyamuledhu' (set to Sama rƒÅgam), Thooran's 'Santhamillamal sukham undo?' (Nattaikurinji) stresses that there is no joy without patience and no contentment amidst worries. Deep philosophical truths lay hidden in his simple devotional songs. Musical aesthetics and bhava find abundant evidence in his compositions. While he was not a musician, he had profound poetic talents. Like Arunachala Kavirayar, he had to seek outside help to set his lyrics to music. Sivaramakrishna Iyer (who was born in 1913 in Mavelikara, Kerala and had joined Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalaya as music teacher in 1937) was his guru and choreographer. Thooran also availed of the services of senior musicians like K. V. Narayanaswamy, T.K. Govinda Rao and T. V. Sankaranarayanan. Tiger Varadachariar, Musiri Subramania Iyer and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer are three of the eminent musicians who have spoken highly of his compositions. His popular compositions include Gananaathane (Saranga), Kaliyuga Varadhan (Brindavana Saranga), Muralidhara Gopala (Maand), Muruga Muruga (Saveri), Pazhani Nindra (Kapi), Punniyam Oru (Keeravani), Thottu Thottu (Padam in Bihag), and Thaye Thripurasundhari (Shuddha Saveri). Contributions to Tamil literature His songs were published in five volumes entitled 'Isai Mani Manjari'. Other publications include 'Thooran Stories' (1962), 'Nalla Nalla Paattu' (1965), 'Call of the Wild' and 'Bharati' for children, some of which were purchased by Tamil Isai Sangam. He was Chief Editor from 1948 to 1978 of the Tamil Encyclopedia which ran to ten volumes. The credit for bringing out the first- ever Children's Encyclopaedia in Tamil in ten volumes goes to him.

At the start of 2008 it changed its name from the George Parkyn Centre. The George Parkyn Centre was formed in 1995 to help gifted children. One Day School The One Day School was founded in 1996 by Rosemary Cathcart. The first branch that was created was in Central Auckland. There are branches countrywide including Nelson, Tauranga, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. One day each week students do not attend regular school but instead attend One Day School. To attend One Day School a cognitive abilities test needs to be taken and people are accepted if they are found to be in the top 5% relative to the participant's age. One Day School operates throughout New Zealand in school classrooms not being used for normal lessons. There is a cost, currently NZ$60 per week. The Gifted Education Centre can sometimes offer some fee subsidies and is currently trying to reduce the overall cost. The Gifted Education Centre also provides the on-line service GO!, aka Gifted Online, a programme for students wanting to attend One Day School, but do not reside within an area near a One Day School classroom. Several thousand gifted children have attended the One Day School since its inception. =Curriculum= At One Day School there is a set format to the day. There is generally a topic for the term. It is usually broad such as time, identity, strength, etc. Then each week a new subtopic is covered such as time travel, nations' identities, strength in relationships, etc. The day is divided into three parts-Think/Reason/Discuss, Read/Write/Research and Make/Do/Create. Think/Reason/Discuss is where the teacher introduces the topic and prompts discussion. Later in Read/Write/Research students do as the name suggests. It is also so for Make/Do/Create. In May 2014 the Gifted Education Centre and Gifted Kids merged to become the New Zealand Centre for Gifted Education.

He was officially \\"King of Uruk\\" in his inscriptions, and is therefore consider as the founder, and only member, of the \\"Fifth dynasty of Uruk\\" (Uruk V).\\"Utu- hengal, king of Uruk\\" in  Life and reign  There are several theories regarding his background. The most common is that he was a governor of Uruk who revolted against the Gutian kings in c. 2050 BC. He led the cities of Sumer against the last Gutian king Tirigan. After a battle at an unknown location, Utu-Hengal was victorious and forced Tirigan to flee back towards Gutium., p. 37 Tirigan fled to the city of Dubrum (location unknown) where the people treated him kindly. However, once the people of Dubrum heard that Utu- Hengal was marching towards the city they took Tirigan and his family prisoner. He was brought before Utu-Hengal, and agreed to leave Sumer and retreat back to Gutium.As described in the document translated by Kramer, The Summerians, pp. 325f Utu-hengal name and titles on his victory stele (photograph and transcription): \\"Utu-hengal, the great man, King of Uruk, King of the four quarters of the world\\". After defeating the Gutians, Utu-hengal established himself as the king of Sumer. In the seventh year of the kingship he tragically died in an accident when inspecting a dam (leading some to suspect foul play), and was succeeded by his son-in-law, the governor of Ur, Ur-Nammu, as the king of Sumer. He was thus the only king of the fifth dynasty of Uruk. In fact Sumerian people have always treated Utu-hengal's kingship and the Ur III dynasty together as a single continuous dynasty, with Utu-hengal as the founder. Utu-hengal has been praised as one of the greatest historical figures and heroes of Sumerian people. =Titulature= In his Victory Stele, Utu-hengal describes himself as:  Family  Utu-hengal had a daughter who married Ur-Nammu and gave birth to his successor, Shulgi, and was therefore related by marriage to the third dynasty of Ur.

Savagnin Rose is a member of the Traminer family of grapes, and as such is related to both Savagnin Blanc and Gew√ºrztraminer. It has a different skin colour than Savagnin Blanc, and does not have the aromatic properties of the much more common Gew√ºrztraminer, which is a musqu√© mutation of Savagnin Rose, or of a similar red-skinned Traminer variety. Savagnin Rose is now relatively rare in cultivation, and primarily found only in pure plantation and varietal wines in Alsace, where the designation Klevener de Heiligenstein denotes a wine produced from Savagnin Rose. It is also likely that a proportion of non-Musqu√© red Traminer exists side by side with Musque red Traminer/Gew√ºrztraminer in older vineyards of Germany and Austria. The vines of the Savagnin Rose variety planted in Alsace bear striking similarities, morphologically, to Gew√ºrztraminer vines and are almost indistinguishable on inspection. Outside of DNA testing and analysis of the wine that both grapes produce, the only noticeable difference is that just prior to veraison the grapes of Savagnin Rose turn almost translucent while the skins of Gew√ºrztraminer grapes are more opaque. The most obvious way to distinguish the two was to compare the type of wines that each produces with Gew√ºrztraminer wine being much more aromatic. Until the 1970s, winemakers would label wines of better quality \\"Gew√ºrztraminer\\" and wines of lesser quality \\"Traminer\\" or \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein\\", regardless of the final composition of Gew√ºrztraminer, Savagnin Rose and/or Traminer in the wine. In 1973, the names Traminer and Savagnin Rose was discontinued from use on Alsatian wine labels. Due to the significant plantings of Savagnin Rose in Heiligenstein and the villages around it, the wine style of \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein\\" was granted a grace period for use of that name.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 105 Harcourt Books 2001 Synonyms For the Traminer family in general, it is difficult to establish where the line goes between synonyms and different varieties.

He is the current manager of Portuguese club C.S. Mar√≠timo. He spent his entire playing career in Portugal, mainly with Belenenses in the Primeira Liga. An Angolan international for five years, he played at the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations. Vidigal managed seven clubs in Portugal's top flight, including Belenenses. He also led his nation at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Playing career Born in Luanda, Portuguese Angola, Vidigal spent his entire career in Portugal, representing at the professional level O Elvas CAD, S.C. Campomaiorense, C.F. Os Belenenses and C.D. Santa Clara and retiring in 2003 at the age of 34, playing 214 matches the Primeira Liga and the Segunda Liga combined. Internationally, Vidigal appeared for Angola at the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations, earning a total of 16 caps. Coaching career Immediately after retiring in 2004, Vidigal took up coaching, starting with lowly A.D. Pontassolense and G.D. Ribeir√£o. In 2008, he moved to C.F. Estrela da Amadora ‚Äì coaching his younger brother Lu√≠s after he returned from a lengthy spell in Italy ‚Äì and joined second level's Portimonense S.C. in February of the following year. In late October 2009, as Manuel Fernandes bought out his contract at U.D. Leiria to return to his favorite club Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, Vidigal was named his successor. On 8 January 2011, he was appointed coach of the Angolan national side. The Black Antelopes qualified for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations in October, and were eliminated at the group stage of the final tournament in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. With the stated aim of winning titles abroad rather than avoiding relegation in Portugal, Vidigal remained in Africa and signed with Libya's Al-Ittihad Club from December 2012. The following April, he left Tripoli due to political instability. Sacked by AEL Limassol of the Cypriot First Division at the start of the campaign, Vidigal returned to Belenenses late into 2013‚Äì14, replacing Marco Paulo at the helm of the bottom-placed team and becoming their third coach of the season. Even though he did not finish the following campaign, being replaced by Jorge Sim√£o with nine matches to go, the side eventually qualified to the UEFA Europa League after finishing sixth. Vidigal repeated the feat in 2015‚Äì16 after leading F.C. Arouca to a best-ever classification of fifth, in only the club's third year in the top flight. Previously, in March 2016, he renewed his contract for two years. In February 2017, Vidigal left Arouca for Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. on an 18-month contract with the option of a further year. Despite leading the team to the runners-up position behind Hapoel Be'er Sheva FC, he was sacked by director Jordi Cruyff at the end of the season. Vidigal returned to Portugal's top flight in October 2017 when he was hired by C.D. Aves, but after disputes with the board he left the following January. Ahead of the following campaign, he signed a two-year deal at Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, and again parted before its conclusion. Days later, he replaced the sacked Jorge Sim√£o at struggling Boavista FC. On 17 December 2019, having taken 18 points from 14 league fixtures, Vidigal was dismissed. He returned to Set√∫bal the following 6 July, three points above the drop zone with four games to play. Having succeeded in that task, he moved on to C.S. Mar√≠timo to replace Jos√© Manuel Gomes. Personal life Vidigal had 12 brothers and sisters, four of his male siblings being footballers: Beto, Lu√≠s (who played for Sporting CP and in the Serie A, represented Portugal and was coached in the 2008‚Äì09 campaign by Lito), Toni and Jorge. His nephew, Andr√©, was also involved in the sport professionally.

However, rather than become a theology professor he spent the following seventeen years in pastoral work before he was chosen as an Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba (in those days given to someone from Spain) at the relatively young age of forty (at the same time he was in the running to become Auditor of the Roman Rota). Although he was aided by several other prominent Spaniards in administering his Cuban diocese, Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠n was eventually returned to Spain in the more prestigious role of Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela in 1889. He was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in 1897 and participated in the 1903 and 1914 papal conclaves. However, by the time of the 1922 conclave Cardinal Mart√≠n was much too old to travel to Rome and thus he excused himself from participating. He died in December of that year.

When Nagy appeared at last at 9 p.m., he started his speech by calling the people \\"comrades\\" and the crowd started to whistle and boo at the much-awaited speaker in protest against the word introduced under the Communist regime. rev.hu Honv√©delem.hu Nagy promised reforms but called for the demonstrators to go home. Part of the crowd marched to the state radio instead, put it under siege and occupied it after heavy fighting. * On October 23, in the evening the 18 m high statue of Joseph Stalin in Budapest's City Park was toppled, dragged to the National Theatre and there broken to small pieces. Afterwards the place where the statue had been standing has been jokingly referred to as \\"Boots Square\\", since the only things that remained of Stalin's statue were his boots.√ºnnep.eu * On October 25 a crowd of thousands at the Budapest city centre's Astoria juncture made friends with the crew of a Russian tank row and pinned Hungarian flags on the tanks. When the people saw Russian tanks approaching from another direction with Hungarian flags on them, the word spread in the crowd: \\"The revolution has won!\\" es.hu * Hours later dozens of people died and hundreds were injured at the Parliament building when persons still not identified, and (in a subsequent onslaught) Soviet tanks opened fire on the people, part of whom had arrived from Astoria. At the nearby Communist Party national headquarters also wild shooting started among various Hungarian and Soviet units. Rounds by a Soviet tank hit the party meeting room where top party leaders were negotiating with Soviet comrades including Georgy Malenkov. The party officials fled into the cellar. jaky.hu (.doc file) * On October 26 freedom fighters at the Corvin k√∂z resistance centre forced Russian tanks to flee by laying porcelain plates borrowed from a nearby public kitchen on the street pavement. The Soviet tank units, which had suffered heavy losses at Corvin k√∂z in the previous days, did not dare to drive through the plates, believing them to be weapons. * On October 30 several tanks of the Hungarian army arrived to K√∂zt√°rsas√°g t√©r (Republic Square) (today: Pope John Paul II square) to relieve the Communist Party's Budapest headquarters which was under siege. The crew of the tanks did not know Budapest.

This intervention ended the siege quickly. beszelo.c3.hu * On October 30 the freedom fighters, after occupying the party headquarters on Republic Square, dug huge holes in the square, using heavy vehicles. They searched for secret underground rooms because previously rumours spread that the police of the regime kept and tortured political prisoners there. Some of the holes were as deep as 10 metres. Finally nothing was found. * On October 31 the state radio aired the famous sentence in which they admitted lying for years in favour of the dictatorship: \\"We lied at night, we lied at day, we lied in every wavelength\\" (a quotation from writer Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny) mbk.org. * On November 7 ‚Äì the anniversary of the Russian October Revolution ‚Äì the freedom fighters of the T≈±zolt√≥ Street resistance group placed Hungarian as well as red flags on all of the buildings under their control to send the message to the Soviet soldiers that the Soviets are fighting against a real workers' revolution and draw parallels of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution with the Russian Revolution of 1917. * On November 11: The fall of the Revolution in Csepel, the 21st district of Budapest. * On November 18 a seven meter long Hungarian flag rolled in the wind from the torch of the Statue of Liberty in New York City, pinned there by a group of Hungarian immigrants, who also spread out an even bigger banner saying: \\"SAVE HUNGARY, END GENOCIDE\\".

In 1779, it was renamed Spassk and made the seat of an uyezd by a decree of Catherine the Great. However, soon it became apparent that confusion would result since several other towns in Russia shared the name (notably Spassk-Ryazansky) and the town was officially renamed Spassk-na-Studentse (). In 1925, a communist party conference in the uyezd resolved that the town be renamed Bednodemyanovsk () in honor of the poet Demyan Bedny. Bedny himself never visited the town, but was said to maintain a lively correspondence with its inhabitants.

He is also a former general manager of the NHL's Dallas Stars. Front office career =Dallas Stars= Armstrong joined the Dallas Stars organization in 1991 and was appointed general manager on January 25, 2002. He won the Stanley Cup as an assistant general manager with the Stars in 1999. Armstrong replaced Bob Gainey as GM of the Stars with 32 games to go in the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season, and one of his first moves was hiring Dave Tippett as head coach. Armstrong is the son of NHL Hall of Fame linesman Neil Armstrong, inducted in 1991. On November 13, 2007, in the wake of a 7‚Äì7‚Äì3 start and a colossal meltdown by the team away against the Los Angeles Kings (losing 6‚Äì5 in overtime after leading 4‚Äì0 with seven minutes remaining in the game), Armstrong was fired as GM and replaced by former Stars player Brett Hull and assistant GM Les Jackson as interim co-general managers. During Armstrong's tenure, the Stars went 210‚Äì109‚Äì35‚Äì23 in the regular season, representing a .634 winning percentage, which is best in Stars history for a General Manager. Some important moves Armstrong made during his time as GM included the drafting of players like Trevor Daley, James Neal, Loui Eriksson and Jamie Benn. He also made a trade for Mike Ribeiro in exchange for defenceman Janne Niinimaa, which turned out to be beneficial for Dallas' offence. =St. Louis Blues= On May 29, 2008, the St. Louis Blues announced they had named Armstrong as the club‚Äôs director of player personnel after signing him to a two-year contract. When the two years were up, Armstrong became the club‚Äôs general manager after Larry Pleau‚Äôs retirement. On June 17, 2010, the Blues acquired goaltender Jaroslav Halak from the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for prospects Lars Eller and Ian Schultz. Although he had yet to officially take over duties as GM, this was considered to be Armstrong‚Äôs first big move as the GM of the Blues. In 2013, Armstrong was named the NHL General Manager of the Year and runner up again in 2019. In his ongoing tenure with the Blues, Armstrong has acquired many marquee players (whether by trade, free agency or the NHL Draft), including Martin Brodeur, Ryan O'Reilly, Vladimir Tarasenko, Jaden Schwartz, Alex Pietrangelo, Jay Bouwmeester, Paul Stastny and Ryan Miller. In 2018-19, Armstrong's Blues would surge up the standings for a third-place finish in the Central Division before eventually defeating the Boston Bruins in seven games to win their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. In Armstrong's ten seasons as General Manager with St. Louis, the Blues have won three Central Division Regular Season titles (2011-12, 2014-15, 2019-20) and reached the Stanley Cup Playoffs eight times, Divisional Finals four times, Conference Finals twice and won the Stanley Cup in 2019. =International= Armstrong has been part of Hockey Canada's management group for the gold medal-winning teams in the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics; 2007 and 2016 Gold Medal World Championship Teams, 2016 World Cup Championship Winning Team plus the Silver Medal Winning Teams in the 2008 and 2009 World Championship.

The latter will almost always be more difficult to achieve. Market share is closely monitored for signs of change in the competitive landscape, and it frequently drives strategic or tactical action.\\"Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project. Additionally, market share is a key metric in understanding performance relative to the growth of the market as measurement of internal sales growth (or decline) only may be a result of similar growth or declines in the industry being measured. Increasing market share is one of the most important objectives of business. The main advantage of using market share as a measure of business performance is that it is less dependent upon macro environmental variables such as the state of the economy or changes in tax policy. In the United States market, however, increasing market share may be dangerous for makers of fungible and potentially hazardous products such as medicine, due to a US-only legal doctrine called market share liability.  Purpose  Market share is said to be a key indicator of market competitiveness, i.e. how well a firm is doing against its competitors. \\"This metric, supplemented by changes in sales revenue, helps managers evaluate both primary and selective demand in their market. That is, it enables them to judge not only total market growth or decline but also trends in customers‚Äô selections among competitors. Generally, sales growth resulting from primary demand (total market growth) is less costly and more profitable than that achieved by capturing share from competitors. Conversely, losses in market share can signal serious long-term problems that require strategic adjustments. Firms with market shares below a certain level may not be viable. Similarly, within a firm‚Äôs product line, market share trends for individual products are considered early indicators of future opportunities or problems.\\" Research has also shown that market share is a desired asset among competing firms. Experts, however, discourage making market share an objective and criterion upon which to base economic policies. The aforementioned usage of market share as a basis for gauging the performance of competing firms has fostered a system in which firms make decisions with regard to their operation with careful consideration of the impact of each decision on the market share of their competitors. It is generally necessary to commission market research (generally desk/secondary research) to determine. Sometimes, though, one can use primary research to estimate the total market size and a company's market share.  Construction  \\"Market share: The percentage of a market accounted for by a specific entity.\\" \\"Unit market share: The units sold by a particular company as a percentage of total market sales, measured in the same units.\\" :Unit market share (%) = 100 * Unit sales (#) / Total Market Unit Sales (#) \\"This formula, of course, can be rearranged to derive either unit sales or total market unit sales from the other two variables, as illustrated in the following:\\" :Unit sales (#) = Unit market share (%) * Total Market Unit Sales (#) / 100 :Total Market Unit Sales (#) = 100 * Unit sales (#) / Unit market share (%) \\"Revenue market share: Revenue market share differs from unit market share in that it reflects the prices at which goods are sold. In fact, a relatively simple way to calculate relative price is to divide revenue market share by unit market share.\\" :Revenue market share (%) = 100 :Sales Revenue ($) / Total Market Sales Revenue($) \\"As with the unit market share, this equation for revenue market share can be rearranged to calculate either sales revenue or total market sales revenue from the other two variables.\\" Market share can be decomposed into three components, namely penetration share, share of customer, and usage index. These three underlying metrics can then be used to help the brand identify market share growth opportunities.Fripp, Geoff, ‚ÄúDecomposing Market Share‚Äù The Marketing Study Guide In a 2010 survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 67% responded that they found the revenue or \\"dollar market share\\" metric very useful, while 61% found \\"unit market share\\" very useful.  Methodologies  \\"Although market share is likely the single most important marketing metric, there is no generally acknowledged best method for calculating it. This is unfortunate, as different methods may yield not only different computations of market share at a given moment, but also widely divergent trends over time. The reasons for these disparities include variations in the lenses through which share is viewed (units versus dollars), where in the channel the measurements are taken (shipments from manufacturers versus consumer purchases), market definition (scope of the competitive universe), and measurement error.\\" It is generally accepted that no single source will provide a fully comprehensive market share, as most methods of calculation are incomplete. Methods such as POS aggregation may omit specific retailers or brands from the calculation, while methods such as collecting consumer data may rely on recall or collecting data from a representative sample. The best method of market share calculation depends on the industry and the methods available.

She has a three-octave vocal range. The San Diego Union-Tribune voted Del Rio one of the \\"Top 10 Singers in San Diego\\", after which she moved to Los Angeles in 1989 to further develop her career. After recording the song \\"Llorando\\", a Spanish-language version of Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\", she moved to Nashville in 1994. There, she was signed to Irving Azoff's label, Giant Records, and recorded her first album, Nobody's Angel. The title track was released on a compilation album and made it to No. 2 on the singles charts in the Netherlands. Her vocals can be heard on numerous soundtracks including Sin City, Streets of Legend, Man on Fire, and Mia Sarah. Del Rio made a cameo appearance in David Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, singing \\"Llorando\\" a cappella. She is also featured in Richard Kelly's film Southland Tales, providing solo vocals in a string arrangement of \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". She performed the song \\"No Stars\\", written in collaboration with David Lynch and John Neff, at the end of Part 10 of Twin Peaks: The Return. Joining Del Rio on stage was the musician Moby on guitar. Performance in Mulholland Drive film The filmmaker David Lynch created the scene in the neo-noir film Mulholland Drive in which Del Rio sings in the Club Silencio after hearing her sing \\"Llorando\\" at his home studio on the suggestion of the music agent Brian Loucks. Lynch then invited her to perform in the film. Lynch refers to this event as \\"a happy accident.\\" Del Rio's emotional rendition of the song inspired the creation and development of the scene itself. In his book, The Impossible David Lynch, writer Todd McGowan describes Del Rio's performance with the phrase \\"the voice as the impossible object.\\" In the nightclub scene, Del Rio is introduced as \\"La Llorona de Los √Ångeles\\" (Crying Woman from Los Angeles), who belts out the song in a depressive stupor, only to faint onstage while the song continues playing. Film critic Zina Giannopoulou likens the song's performance and (symbolic) death of the singer as a parallel to the relationship between the two female doppelg√§nger characters, Diane/Betty and Rita/Camilla.

The lyrics and music were written by Allin, while Antiseen serves as Allin's backup band. The album consists of spoken word by Allin, interspersed with musical tracks featuring Allin on vocals backed by Antiseen.  Background  The title of the album was appropriated from the name of an obscure Texas band (formed entirely independently of Allin) - which performed as his backing band for several live dates in the late 1980s, a name in turn appropriated by Allin for the name of the studio band (including Allin's friend Mark Sheehan on guitar) which recorded the GG Allin and the Murder Junkies Watch Me Kill 6-track EP, released on Fuckin' A/Stomach Ache Records in 1991. The third GG Allin-related band calling itself The Murder Junkies was formed in the same year, around the time that the Allin and ANTiSEEN Murder Junkies album was recorded. This final outfit calling itself The Murder Junkies became what would prove to be Allin's last backing band. Jeff Clayton, lead singer of ANTiSEEN, has described this album as a mixed blessing. Although he is very happy with the way it turned out, he thinks that a lot of people got the impression that they are nothing more than a backing band for Allin. Clayton has stated that Allin was very professional during the recording of the album, and he wonders how much of Allin's stage act was real and how much of it was \\"for the marks.\\" In 2003, a second CD version of the album was released by TKO Records. This version omitted Allin's spoken word material in favor of bonus material: the GG Allin and ANTiSEEN \\"Violence Now\\" 7\\", and the GG Allin and the Carolina Shitkickers \\"Layin' Up With Linda\\" 7\\" EP. The Carolina Shitkickers, contrary to popular hearsay, were not simply ANTiSEEN under another name. The band was composed of Jeff Clayton (ANTiSEEN), Jeff Young (aka BBQ Young and Brother of Joe Young, guitarist for ANTiSEEN), Greg Clayton (ANTiSEEN) and Robert Everett (a.k.a. Suave Robbe - pronounced Swa-vey Ra-bey). The Carolina Shitkickers e.p. is composed of acoustic country music ‚Äì as opposed to the punk rock that that ANTiSEEN played on the \\"Murder Junkies\\" album and \\"Violence Now\\" 7\\" ‚Äì and was recorded in Charlotte, NC, very shortly before Allin's passing. A version of the album (entitled Murder Junkies/Live) was also released during the 1990s by the label Baloney Shrapnel, minus the spoken word pieces and with added live tracks.

Panicker is an ethnic group belonging to the Hindu religion, who live in the South Malabar and central parts of the Indian state of Kerala. They were well known as the masters of Kalari tradition, having their Nalpatheeradi Kalari (name derived from its area of 42 x 21 feet). They are the people who propagated and practised Kalaripayattu, the martial art form of Kerala. Etymology The Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa said that \\"They are the skillful men who teach this art Kalarippayattu, and they are called the Panickers: these are the captains in war.\\". This title was most commonly used by the Nairs. The title was also used by Kaniyars,Ezhavas and Syrian Christians. The surname Panicker is used by many communities today. Kiriyathil and Illathu Nair- Panickers were the teachers of Kalarippayattu and suicide squads of Kings. In Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India it, is given that \\"The teachers of martial arts in order to distinguish themselves from other Panikkars, named themselves as Vanma, Varma Panikkars. = Meloot Panicker = \\"Meloot (descendant of Chera dynasty) is a prominent varma family in kerala kalari tradition.

Varmas received principal royalty status from The Kingdom of Travancore Since 1827 for their service . They are chiefly known as Meloot Varma Panickers or Meloot Panickers.\\" At present , Kalaripayattu is not practiced or followed in some of the Meloot families, yet they keep their tradition and heritage very close to them. \\"Although Panicker title are commonly used by other castes in Kerala they are different from Melootu Varma caste as \\" Panicker\\" is the title they got rewarded for their renowned military administration\\" Notable people * Achyuta Panikkar, astronomer of Kerala * Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, warrior of the 19th century * Ayyappa Paniker, poet * Cheerappanchira Panicker, kalari martial arts practitioner * G.N.Panicker, literary figure * K.

Paper is a TDMA-based MAC protocol which is integrated with clustering and a simple routing protocol in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The goal of LEACH is to lower the energy consumption required to create and maintain clusters in order to improve the life time of a wireless sensor network. Protocol  LEACH is a hierarchical protocol in which most nodes transmit to cluster heads, and the cluster heads aggregate and compress the data and forward it to the base station (sink). Each node uses a stochastic algorithm at each round to determine whether it will become a cluster head in this round. LEACH assumes that each node has a radio powerful enough to directly reach the base station or the nearest cluster head, but that using this radio at full power all the time would waste energy. Nodes that have been cluster heads cannot become cluster heads again for P rounds, where P is the desired percentage of cluster heads. Thereafter, each node has a 1/P probability of becoming a cluster head again. At the end of each round, each node that is not a cluster head selects the closest cluster head and joins that cluster. The cluster head then creates a schedule for each node in its cluster to transmit its data. All nodes that are not cluster heads only communicate with the cluster head in a TDMA fashion, according to the schedule created by the cluster head. They do so using the minimum energy needed to reach the cluster head, and only need to keep their radios on during their time slot. LEACH also uses CDMA so that each cluster uses a different set of CDMA codes, to minimize interference between clusters. Properties Properties of this algorithm include: *Cluster based *Random cluster head selection each round with rotation. Or cluster head selection based on sensor having highest energy *Cluster membership adaptive *Data aggregation at cluster head *Cluster head communicate directly with sink or user *Communication done with cluster head via TDMA *Threshold value Simulation There are many both open-source and commercial network simulators for LEACH such as # ns (open source) # OPNET (proprietary software) # NetSim (proprietary software) # OMNeT++ (IDE) # TinyOS (open source) # MATLAB # contiki (open source)  Shortcomings of LEACH  Shortcomings of LEACH include: * Remaining energy among the nodes isn't considered when selecting Cluster Heads * Random and variable size cluster formations * Random and uneven distribution of cluster heads * Single hop communication in situations where energy use is less efficient from cluster head to base station  References  Category:Wireless sensor network Category:Cluster analysis algorithms ","title":"Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy"},{"id":"8012622","text":"Nor√∞sk√°li () is a settlement in the Faroe Islands on the island of Eysturoy, a few kilometres north of Oyri.

M√∂re was divided into two hundreds: M√∂re Northern Hundred and M√∂re Southern Hundred. M√∂re is mentioned c. 900, by Wulfstan of Hedeby as Meore: The mention is viewed as evidence that M√∂re was a well-known region. Traditionally, it has also been interpreted as evidence of 9th-century rule from the M√§laren Valley, but some modern historians instead opine that Sweons was a general term for peoples north of Denmark and did not imply centralised Swedish rule. From the late 13th century and onwards, M√∂re was responsible for supporting Kalmar Castle. Legally, it was part of the jurisdiction of √ñsterg√∂tland, until 1559, when it was transferred to the newly formed jurisdiction of Sm√•land. Nils Dacke, main leader of the peasant side in the Dacke War against king Gustav Vasa, was born in Vissefj√§rda parish in M√∂re Southern Hundred around 1510.

He played his entire career for the Atlanta Braves from 1975 to 1984. Although his primary position was catcher, Pocoroba played at third base as well. Pocoroba was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1971 and played for four of their minor league affiliates until 1975, when the Braves promoted him to the major leagues. There, he served as the team's backup catcher and was selected as an All-Star in 1978. After shoulder injuries resulted in him losing playing time, he played his last game on April 20, 1984. He subsequently started a sausage business outside Atlanta. Early life Pocoroba was born in Burbank, California, on July 25, 1953. He was the second of Victor and Ida Pocoroba's seven children. He attended Canoga Park High School, where he displaced Bob Adams ‚Äì a fellow future major league player ‚Äì as the school team's starting catcher in 1969. He was also selected as an All-City player. Pocoroba graduated from Canoga Park High in 1971. He was subsequently drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 17th round of that year's MLB draft. Professional career =Minor leagues= Pocoroba began his professional baseball career with the Wytheville Braves, a minor league baseball team that were members of the Appalachian League. He had just one plate appearance with the Richmond Braves in 1972, before spending the rest of the year with the Greenwood Braves. There, he batted .259 with seven home runs and 29 runs batted in (RBIs) in 42 games played, enough to earn him a promotion to the Class-AA Savannah Braves of the Southern League in the following season. He played 193 games for that team from 1973 to 1974. Although he hit three fewer home runs and one fewer RBI in his second season, he managed to raise his batting average from .234 to .311. During his stint in the minor leagues, Pocoroba was noted for demonstrating good defense together with \\"strong on-base skills\\". As a rookie, Pocoroba attracted attention during spring training in 1975 by throwing out 11 straight would-be base stealers.Biff Pocoroba at Baseballlibrary.com =Atlanta Braves (1975‚Äì1984)= Pocoroba made his Major League Baseball debut on April 25, 1975, at the age of 21, entering as a defensive replacement in a 5‚Äì3 loss to the San Diego Padres at San Diego Stadium. He endeared himself with fans despite the Braves performing poorly during his tenure there. This was partly attributed to \\"the sound of his name\\". His best season was in 1977, when he achieved a career-best 113 games played, a .290 batting average, eight home runs, 24 doubles, and 44 RBIs. It was the only season in his career in which he played over 100 games. Defensively, he finished second in the National League (NL) in passed balls (15) and stolen bases allowed (103). However, he compensated for this by recording the third highest range factor per nine innings (6.99) as catcher, while finishing fifth in assists (78) and fielding percentage (.989) at his position and catching the fifth highest number of baserunners stealing (52). He also earned the NL Player of the Week Award for the week of May 16 to 22 that same year. During that period, he batted .555 with two home runs and seven RBIs, culminating with a pinch-hit, walk-off grand slam against the Montreal Expos on May 17. After the season concluded, he requested to be traded, but eventually signed a seven-year contract to remain with the Braves. Pocoroba was selected to the NL All-Star team as a reserve in 1978. He entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning of the game. After catching Bruce Sutter for the first two outs, he recorded the final out with his Braves teammate Phil Niekro. That year, Pocoroba finished with a .242 batting average, six home runs and 34 RBIs in 92 games. Defensively, he led NL catchers in range factor per game (6.29), but allowed the fourth-most stolen bases (82) and again finished second in passed balls (12). Injuries to his shoulder took its toll on Pocoroba, who played an average of 53 games from 1979 to 1983. Consequently, his lost out on playing time and was demoted to the role of a backup and pinch hitter. He played more games as a third baseman (21) than as a catcher (9) during the 1981 season, serving as a replacement for the injured Bob Horner. The Braves advanced to the postseason for the first time in Pocoroba's career in 1982 by winning the National League West division. However, they were swept in the NL Championship Series by the St. Louis Cardinals (the eventual World Series champions), with Pocoroba grounding out in his only plate appearance of the series. He played his final major league game on April 20, 1984, at the age of 30. He was subsequently released by the Braves, having played just four games that season. Noted as a fine contact hitter, Pocoroba finished his career with more walks (182) than strikeouts (109). He also achieved a caught stealing percentage of 34% in the 1976 and 1977 seasons. He is the last MLB player to be named \\"Biff\\". Post- playing career After retiring from baseball, Pocoroba operated a specialty meat business called Sausage World, together with his brothers, Joe and Steve. It was located in Lilburn, in the suburbs of Atlanta, and he worked there for almost three decades. He recalled how his grandfather made the family sausage when he was young, and some of the gourmet sausages made by the company came \\"from old family recipes\\". Personal life Pocoroba was married to Jody Karin Raymond for 37 years until his death. Together, they had four children: Jenna, Keisa, Victor, and Angela.

It is the city's second oldest Sephardic synagogue. It was established in 1884 by Jacob Elias Sassoon, son of Eliyahoo David Sassoon and grandson of David Sassoon; the latter had immigrated from Baghdad to India in 1832 due to persecution and had settled in Mumbai, then known as Bombay. It is maintained by the Jacob Sassoon Trust. The building's significance is attributed to its Jewish traditions as well as Indian and English colonial influences. It was designed by the British architectural firm Gostling & Morris of Bombay. The basement part of the edifice is built in stone masonry and the superstructure is built in brick masonry. The exterior facade of the synagogue is painted turquoise. The sanctuary within the interior of the building is in western direction, towards Jerusalem. Location Knesset Eliyahoo, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, the second oldest Sephardic, is located in Colaba at 55, Dr. V.B. Gandhi Marg, Fort, Mumbai. The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, and Oberoi Trident are nearby. Background Prior to the arrival of Baghdadi Jews in India, the Jews residing in Bombay ‚Äî the name then used for Mumbai ‚Äî had settled in the towns of India, living peacefully with other communities in India. Harry D. Wall, in an interview to the New York Times, has said that among the Jews who now remain in Mumbai are a group of Jews known as Bene Jews or Bene Israel who were reportedly descendants of seven tribes of Israel who, in the 2nd century BC, were shipwrecked on India's Konkan coast while escaping persecution in the Galilee. They found that living in India, amidst a cosmopolitan community consisting of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and, much later, Muslims, was a very cordial environment, totally free of anti-Semitic feelings. The Jewish merchant community, which played a significant role in the commercial development of then Bombay (now Mumbai), consisted of Jews from Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries who immigrated in the late 18th century under the threat of persecution. They found the environment conducive to continuing their trade and settled in the city, becoming prosperous in business ventures such as textile mills and international trading. In 1784, the British government took over the East India Company. With this change, many business opportunities emerged in India, and Bombay in particular, encouraging immigrants to set up businesses. In 1790, one such business magnate was Shalom ben Ovadiah HaCohen, a Baghdadi Jew who had migrated from Aleppo (Halab), in Syria to Bombay; other Jewish businessmen from Baghdad, Basra, and Yemen followed him. History Interior view In 1832, David Sassoon immigrated to Bombay and established himself as a magistrate of the cotton industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Byculla. Mumbai in 1864; this was in addition to the older Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Albert Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884. More Jews came from Bukhara, Persia, and, following the Farhud pogrom in Iraq in 1941, many more immigrants shifted to Bombay. They all used to assemble in the Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue in large numbers during festival days and on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. On many such occasions, in view of the large crowd of devotees, overflow prayer services were held in the neighbouring Cawasjee Jehangir Public Hall. In 1985, President Giani Zail Singh visited the site to honour the centennial of the synagogue's construction. India Post issued a commemorative stamp in honour of the centennial. The first-ever terrorist attack on Jews in Mumbai occurred on 26 November 2008. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who had conducted Sabbath services on the previous day and also held religious discourses at the Knesset Eliyahoo, was killed, along with his wife and a few other Jews at the Nariman House, a community center operated by Chabad. This sowed fear among the Jewish community members residing in Mumbai, and also forged a closer bond between the city's Baghdadi and Bene Israel Jews. Architecture and fittings Designed by the British architectural firm Gostling & Morris of Bombay, the building's base is of stone masonry while the superstructure is of brick masonry. The external frontage of the synagogue is painted turquoise. The inner space contains ornamented pillars, and the sanctuary faces west towards Jerusalem. The bimah (reader's platform) is bordered on both sides by ornately carved marble, over which is placed a tall, stained-glass arch that reaches the ceiling.

It is particularly useful in the study of marine paleoclimatology. The term was coined in 1974 Buddemeier, R. W., Maragos, J. E., and Knutson, D. W. 1974.

It is, therefore, a form of stratigraphy. Sclerochronology focuses primarily upon growth patterns reflecting annual, monthly, fortnightly, tidal, daily, and sub-daily (ultradian) increments of time. The regular time increments are controlled by biological clocks, which, in turn, are caused by environmental and astronomical pacemakers. Familiar examples include annual bandings in reef coral skeletons or annual, fortnightly, daily and ultradian growth increments in mollusk shells as well as annual bandings in the ear bones of fish, called otoliths. Sclerochronology is analogous to dendrochronology, the study of annual rings in trees, and equally seeks to deduce organismal life history traits as well as to reconstruct records of environmental and climatic change through space and time. The science of sclerochronology as applied to hard parts of various organism groups is now routinely used for paleoceanographic and paleoclimate reconstructions.Sch√∂ne, B.R., Oschmann, W., Kr√∂ncke, I., Dreyer, W., Janssen, R., Rumohr, H., Houk, S.D., Freyre Castro, A.D., Dunca, E. and R√∂ssler, J.

It was released on May 17, 2005 via Metal Blade Records. Concept The title of the album was originally derived from an in-joke and story between Guy Kozowyk's family and friends, referring to the mentally disabled students for whom a member of Kozowyk's family drove a bus. This term eventually spread out to mean anybody for whom one provided service. The title reflects the songs, as the songs are stories from and about \\"clients\\", or mentally disabled people, with whom Kozowyk has had experience working in a convenience store located next to a psychiatric rehabilitation/hospital. Each song is a different \\"client\\", or a different person with a mental ailment, ranging from schizophrenia, to multiple personality disorder, to extreme obsessive compulsive disorder. The song \\"Black Santa\\" would best describe the album and its meanings, as it actually depicts everything that is used as an inspiration in the album: Kozowyk's job, the people he encountered, the stories he heard, and the notion that everybody both has and is a \\"client\\", meaning everybody works for somebody, and that everybody is not entirely mentally stable. Music videos The Red Chord released four music videos and singles from Clients. \\"Antman\\", the first single, was directed by David Brodsky of My Good Eye and notably features live ants crawling on Greg Weeks, the band's bassist. It had the honor of being the most played video on MTV2's Headbangers Ball in 2005. \\"Blue Line Cretin\\" was directed by acclaimed artist Paul Romano (who designed the \\"Clients\\" CD graphics). \\"Black Santa\\", again directed by David Brodsky, was shot on location at the notorious Manhattan nightclub, Crobar.

It is named after, and partly set at, the Red Road Flats in Balornock, Glasgow, Scotland, which were the tallest residential buildings in Europe at the time they were built.Red Road Flats, Glasgow Digital Library It was shot largely in a Dogme 95 style, using handheld cameras and natural light. The Observer polled several filmmakers and film critics who voted it as one of the best British films in the last 25 years. Red Road is the first film in Advance Party, a projected trilogy following a set of rules dictating how the films will be written and directed. They will all be filmed and set in Scotland, using the same characters and cast. Each film will be made by a different first-time director.Vervepics.com Plot Jackie Morrison works in Glasgow as a CCTV operator, monitoring the Red Road Flats. She lives alone and engages in occasional sex with married man Avery. Jackie recognises a man she sees on the CCTV monitor and begins inquiring about him. It is revealed that he is Clyde Henderson, a prisoner who has been released early for good behaviour but will be back in prison immediately if he steps out of line. She begins stalking Clyde, tracking him on the CCTV monitors and gathering information about him. She follows Clyde to a cafe, and later learns he is throwing a party at the apartment he shares with fellow ex-con Stevie. She gains entry to the party and begins exchanging looks with a drunk Clyde. They dance, but she makes an excuse and runs out of the apartment. After spotting Clyde on CCTV heading to a local bar, she goes there and sees him break up a fight between Stevie and another man. Stevie and his girlfriend return to Clyde's apartment, while Clyde initiates a conversation with Jackie before inviting her back to the apartment too. Clyde reveals he has a daughter, with whom he regrets he has lost contact. Clyde and Jackie have sex, but she runs from the bedroom and stages rape, striking her face with a stone and fleeing from the apartment block in view of the CCTV cameras. The police identify Clyde as the rapist and Jackie watches the arrest on CCTV, and a few moments later sees Clyde's daughter approach the apartment block. Later, Stevie gains entry to Jackie's home and demands to know why she has falsely accused Clyde. Jackie reveals that Clyde killed her husband and daughter. Jackie relents and tells the police she wishes to withdraw the accusation of rape. After Clyde's release, Jackie confronts him and they argue: Clyde describes the road traffic accident that killed Jackie's husband and daughter, and she reveals that her last words to her daughter were harsh. She tells Clyde that his daughter tried to reach him on the day of his arrest, and they go their separate ways.

A Looney Tunes Christmas (also known as Looney Tunes: Bah Humduck) is a 2006 animated direct-to-DVD Christmas comedy-drama film starring the Looney Tunes characters, directed by Charles Visser, produced by Warner Bros. Animation and animated overseas by Toon City Animation. The film is based on the popular Charles Dickens 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. The special was released on DVD on November 14, 2006, and was then broadcast on Cartoon Network in December 2006. The special was rereleased on DVD as part of the Looney Tunes Holiday Triple Feature in September 2020. Plot As the film's title implies, Daffy Duck stars in an Ebenezer Scrooge-like role in the Looney Tunes retelling of this classic tale. In the beginning of the movie, Bugs Bunny (in a Fred-like role) pops up out of his hole to clear away the snow, and explains to the viewers he's all about winter holidays, despite the fact that rabbits are traditionally associated with Easter. He's then almost run over by Daffy Duck's gas-guzzling SUV. Daffy is the owner of the Lucky Duck Superstore (a Costco-esque megastore). True to his Scrooge-like role, he treats his employees (played by other Looney Tunes characters) like they're garbage. Despite Bugs scolding him for his treatment of Playboy Penguin, Daffy still acts in a snobbish manner and tries to abscond with the money Priscilla Pig, Egghead Jr., Henery Hawk and Barnyard Dawg Jr. are collecting for charity. Daffy especially has trouble with his hover scooter, and gets beat up by his own employees (through no fault of their own) and the customers (since he insulted them too). After Daffy states he hates the holidays, Bugs warns him about the Ghosts of Christmas, at which Daffy simply scoffs. After working his employees to the bone on Christmas Eve, Daffy expects them all back at 5:00 AM on Christmas Day, so he can make more money off of last minute shoppers. Assistant Manager Porky Pig (in a Bob Cratchit-like role) pleads with Daffy to let him go home for Christmas and spend time with his daughter, Priscilla (in a Tiny Tim-like role), but Daffy refuses. Bugs warns him that bad things would happen to people like him (referring to A Christmas Carol) and tells him \\"Bah, Humduck!\\" (an adaption of Scrooge's \\"Bah, Humbug!\\"), which Daffy then takes as his own. Later that day, the spirit of Daffy's deceased business idol, Sylvester the Investor (Sylvester the Cat in a Jacob Marley- like role), who's clad in chains as punishment for his greed after a disgruntled employee ran over him nine times in a forklift, appears before Daffy. Sylvester warns Daffy that if he doesn't change his ways, he will be doomed to the same fate. He also tells Daffy that he still has a chance of escaping his fate, and foretells that three ghosts will visit him. Daffy, thinking of this as a trick by Bugs, does not believe what Sylvester said to him. After the visit, Daffy turns down the requests of Elmer Fudd (who would like some vacation time), Marvin the Martian (who would like to go home to Mars), and Porky Pig (who wants to go home and spend time with his daughter, Priscilla). At the end of the day, everyone goes home for the night. Later that night, Daffy ends up trapped in the store by a snowdrift with Bugs. He locks himself in his vault to be safe. But the ghosts are not that easily stopped. The Ghost of Christmas Past (taking on the form of an old lady and a canary, Granny and Tweety) appears, then takes Daffy back to his childhood, where they see that Daffy lived at the Lucky Duck Orphanage (with his design from Baby Looney Tunes reused), and every Christmas, he was ignored by potential parents, which explains his unhappy demeanor in the Present Day (and how his store got its name). The Ghost of Christmas Present (Yosemite Sam) then appears, and berates Daffy for his treatment of his employees, telling him if he doesn't change his ways, his future is very bleak. He shows him what Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian, and Porky Pig are doing at the time. By this time, Daffy is starting to feel tender emotion (though he doesn't attribute it as guilt), which earns him another one of the Ghosts' numerous beatings. By this time, he actually dreads the visit of the last ghost and pleads with Bugs to hide him from it. After a reenactment of Bugs and Daffy's hiding routine, Daffy is left alone at the mercy of the ghost. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (the Tasmanian Devil) eventually appears, and takes Daffy to the future, showing that because of his greed and selfishness, he has died from an unknown cause. At Daffy's headstone, Porky Pig tells Priscilla about the loss of Daffy. He tells her that because Daffy tried to name himself as his own heir, which is illegal, the Lucky Duck Superstore closed down, leaving everyone out of a job, though it did allow them to spend Christmas with their families just like they wanted. After Porky leaves the grave, Priscilla stays longer and reveals that she never hated Daffy; like him, Priscilla can understand what it's like not having family around at the holidays, and feeling that no one should be alone at this time of year, she promises to come visit his grave every year on Christmas. Priscilla leaves a plate of Christmas cookies on Daffy's grave before following her dad out of the cemetery. Because of Priscilla's kindness, Daffy's cold demeanor melts and his heart breaks. Realizing his greed and selfish nature was to cover up his real wish to be part of a family, Daffy vows to be a kinder and more generous person as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come sends him on his way. Returning to the present, he starts to make reparations by waking up a nearby Elmer where he enlists his help in exchange for accepting his request of vacation time. He promotes Porky to the store manager, gives Marvin a rocket to go home to Mars, hires Playboy Penguin as his new employee, gives all of his employees the gifts they desired, along with a raise and a paid vacation. There's a brief moment when he slides back to his greedy self, contemplating just how he is going to recover all the costs. However, it immediately fades when Priscilla presents a plate of duck-shaped cookies and calls him \\"Uncle Daffy\\". Daffy thinks she's pushing it until she kisses him on the cheek and he lets her call him \\"Uncle Daffy\\" (implying that he finally got his wish to be part of a family). All of this is witnessed by the Ghosts of Christmas. As the film reaches its end, Bugs comments on how he loves the holidays (chomping on a candy cane afterwards), the camera pulls out of the mall to end the movie. Porky and Priscilla finish the movie by saying Porky's famous line: \\"T-T-T-That's all folks!\\" Characters * Bugs Bunny - Himself, Narrator, also a Lucky Duck customer; serves as a Fred-type foil to Daffy. * Daffy Duck - Owner of Lucky Duck Superstore, he despises families and Christmas because he was continuously rejected by potential adopters, which basically explains his greed and love for money. He would stop despising families when he finally gets his wish to be a part of a family by allowing Priscilla to call him uncle.

The scene also reveals that his death was caused by an accident, as opposed to the novel in which Marley died of more natural causes (such as old age). * Granny and Tweety - Ghosts of Christmas Past who takes Daffy to his past to reveal how his greed and love for money surfaced. * Yosemite Sam - Ghost of Christmas Present who beats up Daffy every time he gets insensitive for his employees' misery. * Tasmanian Devil - Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come who is the only one who actually got through to Daffy when he shows him the consequences of his greed: death. * Priscilla Pig - Kind and caring daughter of Porky; serves as a Tiny Tim-type foil to Daffy. * Playboy Penguin - Beggar who lives near Lucky Duck Superstore; towards the end, he becomes a Lucky Duck employee.

He also is known for creating a petition against the NRL during the 2017 Australian Same-Sex Marriage Plebiscite, due to the support of the NRL for the ‚ÄúYes‚Äù campaign. The petition was unsuccessful. Early life Smith was born in Quirindi, New South Wales, playing for his junior club, the Werris Creek Magpies. Rugby league career Smith made his first grade debut in round 20 of the 2004 NRL season for Parramatta against Melbourne Storm at Olympic Park in Melbourne. He established himself in the NRL in 2005, when he had a boom rookie season alongside club namesake, Tim Smith. The monster centre of 102 kg, easily big enough to play in the forwards, damaged opposition teams out wide with his size and strength, scoring 14 tries in an outstanding rookie year. Smith was a part of the 2005 Minor Premiership winning side which made it to the preliminary final before suffering a shock loss going down to North Queensland 29-0. The 2006 NRL season loomed as a learning curve season for Smith as after initially showing all the promise he had from the previous season, he sustained a serious leg injury against the North Queensland Cowboys in round 4, and was sidelined for half the NRL season. He only managed 14 games for three tries, however, it provided the platform for him to return to his best in 2007. Plagued by injuries, Smith's young career has been shortened by extended periods when he was not fit to play. Throughout the 2007 and 2008 seasons, he was in and out of the Parramatta backline. In the 2009 NRL season, Smith began playing in the forward pack. The decision by Eels coach Daniel Anderson was not surprising, given Smith's 16 stone physique. Smith played for Parramatta in the 2009 NRL Grand Final 23-16 defeat against Melbourne. Melbourne were later stripped of the premiership for major and deliberate breaches of the salary cap. In the 2010 NRL season, Smith played 19 games as Parramatta failed to build upon their grand final appearance in 2009, missing the finals series by finishing 12th. The following year in 2011, Smith played nearly every game for the club as they narrowly avoided the wooden spoon. Parramatta defeated the Gold Coast in the final game of the year to avoid finishing last. On 13 May 2012, Smith re-signed with the Eels until the end of the 2014 NRL season. Parramatta would finish last on the table in 2012 for the first time since 1972. In June 2013, Smith was one of 12 Parramatta players that were told that their futures at the club were uncertain by coach, Ricky Stuart. Parramatta would finish the 2013 NRL season with the Wooden Spoon for a second consecutive year. Smith retired at the end of the 2014 NRL season, finishing his career a one club player with 152 games for the Eels.

Tennessee In 1985, DeMoss was hired by Pat Summitt to be her top assistant at the University of Tennessee. During her 18 seasons in Knoxville, the Lady Vols went to 13 Final Fours and won six NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships. As at Auburn, she played a key role as a recruiter, this time as the official recruiting coordinator. Kentucky DeMoss returned to the head coaching ranks in 2003, taking on the job at the University of Kentucky. The Wildcats had fallen off considerably from their glory years of the early 1980s, when the then-LadyKats were regularly competing for Southeastern Conference (SEC) honors. In the two years before DeMoss came to Lexington, the Wildcats had won a total of 20 games. The Wildcats had averaged little over 1,000 in per-game attendance. DeMoss's first priority at Kentucky was recruiting; her first team was widely considered that year to be among the top 10 in the nation. Season ticket sales increased to over 3,000, and the Wildcats led the nation in increased attendance that season, averaging nearly 5,200. Despite an 11-16 record in 2003-04, the team showed marked improvement, reducing their average margin of defeat in SEC play by nearly 9 points. The following season the Wildcats went 18-16, achieving their first winning season since 1999‚Äì2000. They made a strong run in the 2005 Women's National Invitation Tournament, losing to West Virginia in the semifinals in double overtime. DeMoss's breakthrough season with Kentucky proved to be her third year in the 2005-06 season. She entered with one of the youngest team roster in women's college basketball: one senior supported by nine freshmen and sophomores. The team set a new program record of nine conference wins, including a landmark 66-63 win over then top-ranked Tennessee at Rupp Arena on January 26, 2006; the program placed its highest conference rank since the 1980s at fourth. This enabled the team to return to national ranking since their last time in 1993. The Wildcats returned to the NCAA Tournament having waited seven years; they won in the first round against Chattanooga before losing in the next round to Michigan State. After the season, DeMoss was named SEC Coach of the Year by both her fellow coaches and the Associated Press. Her record at Kentucky at the end of the season was 51-42. The Wildcats, returning all five starters, were ranked 15th in the 2006-07 AP preseason poll, the first preseason ranking for Kentucky in the history of the AP women's poll. On April 11, 2007, DeMoss held a press conference to announce her resignation, abruptly stating \\"After 30 years of coaching, I just want to step back and reassess what I want to do for the rest of my life.\\". Four months later, she returned to coaching by taking the assistant position at Texas. Later years After leaving her head coaching position at Kentucky, DeMoss spent 3 seasons (2007 through 2010) as a University of Texas assistant coach under head coach Gail Goestenkors. In May 2010, it was announced that DeMoss was returning to Tennessee as an assistant coach under Pat Summitt. On April 2, 2012, DeMoss announced she would leave the University of Tennessee and become an assistant coach for the WNBA's Indiana Fever. Two years to the day after returning to Knoxville, on April 2, 2014, DeMoss was named associate head coach to new head coach Tyler Summitt at her alma mater, Louisiana Tech.http://www.latechsports.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/040214aab.html In April 2016, Summitt resigned following his admission of an inappropriate relationship. DeMoss was named as interim head coach.

Specialising in nitrogen-based propellants and explosives and nitrocellulose-based products such as varnishes and inks. It was formerly ICI Nobel, a division of the chemicals group ICI, but was then sold to Inabata, a Japanese trading firm. The business was sold on to Chemring Group in 2005 and is now a Scottish Company (Chemring Energetics UK Ltd), part of Chemring Group. History Nobel Industries Limited was founded in 1870 by Swedish chemist and industrialist Alfred Nobel for the production of the new explosive dynamite in the United Kingdom. The factory was overseen and run by George McRoberts. McRoberts and John Downie raised the ¬£24,000 needed to found the company rather than Nobel himself. It was chaired by the Glasgow shipbuilder, Charles Randolph (1809-1878). Ardeer, on the coast at Ayrshire, was chosen for the company's first factory. The business later diversified into the production of blasting gelatine, gelignite, ballistite, guncotton, and cordite. At its peak, the factory employed nearly 13,000 men and women. In 1926, the firm merged with Brunner, Mond & Company, the United Alkali Company, and the British Dyestuffs Corporation, creating a new group, Imperial Chemical Industries, then one of Britain's largest firms. Nobel Industries continued as the ICI Nobel division of the company. ICI Ardeer was commonly known locally as the 'factory' or the 'Dinnamite'. At the time the company generally provided higher quality employment regarding terms and conditions and pension rights than other local firms. At its peak, the site employed almost 13,000 workers in a fairly remote location. The Ardeer site was its own community with enough employees on site that a bank, a travel agency, and a dentist were located on the site. The former Western Scottish Bus Company provided tens of buses per day to transport the workers to and from the site, and there were even two trains per day to transport workers to a station within the factory which was used solely for workers and any special visitors with business in the ICI plant, and was never a regular passenger stop. Until the mid-1960s, there were two trains per day to transport workers. Although the line no longer serves the plant, the abandoned platform remains, hidden beneath dense undergrowth. The factory had its own jetty on the River Garnock in Irvine Harbour serving ships that were delivering explosives that had reached their exploration date, or importing raw materials for the works. In the late 1960s construction began on a nylon and nitric acid plant, but this had a short life, closing down just 12 years later. In 2002 the division, now named Nobel Enterprises, was sold to Inabata. On 8 September 2007 a major fire was reported at the site when 1,500-1,700 tons of nitrocellulose, stored in an open area, caught fire. There was little property damage and no serious injuries. The site is now a flourishing energetics (explosives) business employing some 300 people as the Scottish division of Chemring Group, an LSE Public Company.

The 404 was manufactured from 1953 to 1958, and the 405 from 1955 to 1958. The models were successors to the Bristol 403. The 404 was a two-seat coup√© and the 405 was available as a four- seat, four-door saloon and as a four-seat, two-door drophead coup√©. Unlike previous or later Bristol models, there is considerable confusion in nomenclature when it comes to the Bristol 404 and 405. The 404 was a very short-wheelbase ( as against ) version of the 405, but was introduced in 1953, whereas the 405 was not introduced until 1955 and continued until 1958. The 405 itself was seen in two versions. The more common (265 of 308 built) is a four-door saloon built on the standard chassis of the previous Bristols, whilst the 405 drophead coup√© or 405D (43 built) had a convertible body by Abbotts of Farnham. The body used aluminium panels over a steel and ash frame, mounted on a substantial horse-shoe shaped chassis.Information sheet prepared by the exhibitor (and since January 2005 the owner) of the car with the license plate UHT 405 which, when new, was the company's press demonstrator. Most cars built had a highly tuned (through advanced valve timing) version of the 2 litre six-cylinder engine called the 100C which developed as against the of the standard 100B 405 engine. Even the 105 bhp engine was fitted with Solex triple downdraft carburettors. With UK fuel supplies no longer restricted to the low-octane wartime \\"pool petrol\\", all engines for the 404 and 405 came with higher compression ratios than predecessor Bristols -- 8.5:1 as against 7.5:1. Rack and pinion steering was fitted and the car's handling won accolades from press reports when the car was introduced (and subsequently). Compared to the 403, the 404 and 405 had an improved gearbox with much shorter gear lever which improved what was already by the standards of the day a very slick gearchange. The 405, though not the 404, had overdrive as standard apart from the earliest models, and front disc brakes became an option apart from the earliest models, and were fitted to almost all 405 drophead coup√©s. A few late 405s were fitted with the higher torque 2.2 litre engine introduced in the later 406. Externally, a notable feature of the 404 and 405 was the abandonment of the BMW-style radiator grille for one much more like an aero- engine. The 405, although the only four-door car ever built by Bristol, had styling that the company was later to refine for many years on their later Chrysler V8-engined cars during the 1960s. It was also the model that introduced the Bristol feature of sizable lockers in the front wings accessed externally by gullwing doors. The locker on the nearside held the spare wheel and jack, whilst that on the offside housed the battery and fuse panel.

Born in Lithgow, New South Wales, he studied at the Dattilo Rubbo Art School and the National Art School. Bass served in the Second Australian Imperial Force during the Second World War, rising to the rank of sergeant. He established the Tom Bass Sculpture School in Sydney in 1974. In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to sculpture. In 2009, he was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Visual Arts (honoris causa) at the University of Sydney. A retrospective of his work, spanning 60 years, was exhibited at the Sydney Opera House between 9 November and 17 December 2006.  Totem maker  After graduating from the National Art School, Bass developed his philosophy of working as a sculptor as being the maker of totemic forms and emblems, that is, work expressing ideas of particular significance to communities or to society at large. Examples of his work include The Trial of Socrates and The Idea of a University at Wilson Hall, Melbourne University; The Falconer on Main Building at University of New South Wales, representing the conflict between beauty and the intellect; the winged figure of Ethos in Civic Square, Canberra, representing the spirit of the community, and the Lintel sculpture at the National Library, Canberra, representing the idea of Library. Over a twenty-five-year period this remained virtually the single focus of his work as he became the most sought after public sculptor in Australia. He is represented all over Australia and also overseas.  Contribution to art in Australia  While engaged with his public sculptures, Bass remained largely on the periphery of the evolving art scene in post-Second World War Australia. His contribution to art often went unacknowledged as the focus for artists evolved around the ever growing gallery and art market scene. Art as commodity was never Bass's reason for making sculpture. During the 50s and 60s Bass \\"..was the only Australian sculptor who understood the importance of bringing art to the widest possible audience. ...With every major commission Bass aimed to push the boundaries of public taste, giving his audience a lesson in the visual language of modernism.\\" Sandy roadshow heads west.

Designed as a purely abstract wall fountain, this sculpture did not symbolize any particular aspect of the P&O; Company. Bass's sculpture caused considerable controversy when it was completed in 1963. When the work was unveiled, its indirect resemblance to a Parisian pissoir and its position opposite the French Airline office provoked a witty comment in the sixth edition of OZ magazine (1964) about the city's latest status symbol as a convenience for the people of Sydney and as a welcoming sign to French travellers: \\"there is a nominal charge, of course, but don't worry, there is no need to pay immediately. Just P. & O.\\" (pee and owe). With it they published a renowned satirical photograph which showed the fountain apparently being used as a urinal, with a caption which read \\"Pictured is a trio of Sydney natives P. & O.'ing in the Bass urinal\\".OZ, 1964, title pageStephen, A. (ed.). OZ No. 6, February 1963. Modern Times: The untold story of Modernism in Australia, 2008, The Miegunyah Press For this and other supposed offences the editors of the magazine, Richard Neville, Richard Walsh and Martin Sharp were charged, tried and sentenced to jail with hard labour for \\"obscenity and encouraging public urination\\", although the defendants subsequently appealed against the sentences, which were revoked. In the trial Tom Bass appeared in their defence. Although the building is no longer owned by P&O;, the work maintains an iconic presence in Sydney. The building was demolished in December 2017 for the construction of the Martin Place entrance to the Sydney Metro station 23 metres below street level, and the location of the wall fountain not known. AGC sculpture *1963, Copper 335.3√ó152.4√ó38 cm Commissioned by AGC (Australian Guarantee Corporation) Australia in 1962 for AGC House, 126 Phillip Street, Sydney When the original building was completely demolished in 2002, the work was salvaged, restored and reinstalled by Investa Property Group into the Foster and Partners designed building in late 2005. The AGC sculpture is an emblem inspired by the corporate and financial transactions in what was then known as the hire purchase system. It takes the form of a mechanical corporate tree in which the branches symbolize the various interests of AGC, as it existed in 1962. The two top branches represent the dominant lending arm and the supporting arm is insurance. These branches support a wheel that symbolizes the automobile which was the first reason for hire purchase. At the base, there are two protective arms, similar to tree roots that signify the importance of security and stability. Amicus certus ‚Äì AMP sculpture *1962, Copper 451√ó424√ó40 cm Commissioned by Australia Mutual Providence in 1960 for AMP Building (or House), 33 Alfred Street, Sydney. The AMP emblem (logo) signifies the value of insurance in our daily family life. Redesigned by Bass for the iconic Sydney Cove building, the central figure represents the Goddess of Plenty who watches over the family figures represented by a mother, father and child, reflecting AMP's motto: (a true friend in uncertain times). To this day, the Sydney Cove building remains the Australian headquarters of AMP. Research ‚Äì ICI sculpture *1959, Copper 686√ó206√ó35 cm Commissioned by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in 1956 for 61 Macquarie Street. In 1999, with the assistance of Mirvac, the sculpture was relocated to the north wall of Quay Grand Suites, adjacent to the Moore Steps, Sydney. It is a sculptural tribute to industry and scientific research. The crucible, held up by five figures, is the vessel in which the raw materials are synthesized. Each figure represent an agent of change to process those materials: electricity, radiation, chemical changes, heat and mechanical forces. The agents dip into the crucible to achieve change. The star represents the sun, a source of energy and transformation. The final product rises out of the crucible in the form of the ICI symbol. The Sisters (Variations I, II & III 1980) *Bronze, 80√ó250√ó240 cm Originally exhibited in Bass's first solo exhibition at the Sydney David Jones Gallery in 1980, the work reappeared in public at Martin Place for Sculpture in the City 2001 as part of Art About. Through their various poses, Bass plays with the illusion that all the entwining female figures are physically different. In fact, the two outward figures were cast as exact copies. The Sisters express sheer joy and exuberance equalled by Bass's admiration of the Sydney Opera House. Their deliberate placement by Bass on the path to the Opera House heralds this excitement for visitors on approaching this iconic architectural masterpiece. Tom Bass Sculpture Studio School After an intense career as a public sculptor, Bass felt that sculpture as a medium of social communication was losing its relevance. He went through a period of life review and went back to teach at the National Art School. He soon decided that it was not possible for him to teach in the way he wanted under that system. So he conceived the idea of setting up an independent school of sculpture. He began a long search to find an appropriate place for the school. This culminated in the warehouse above Broadway, a space which had been occupied by goldsmiths ever since its completion in 1911. He spent a year cleaning the space and preparing it for classes and in 1974 classes began in the studio. The school moved from Broadway to Erskineville in 1998, where it continues to run sculpture classes today.

He currently plays at fly half or inside centre for Newcastle Falcons having previously played for Toulouse and Leicester Tigers. He has also played 60 international matches for England. Early life Flood was born in Frimley, Surrey. Both of his grandfathers were actors. His paternal grandfather, Gerald Flood, voiced the robot companion Kamelion in Doctor Who. His maternal grandfather was German actor Albert Lieven, who appeared in The Guns of Navarone, and his maternal grandmother was English actress Susan Shaw. Flood's father, Tim, was (2013) the programme and marketing manager of the Customs House Theatre, South Shields. Flood was brought up in Morpeth, Northumberland where he attended Chantry School. He also went to the Kings School in Tynemouth. Flood graduated from Northumbria University in 2007 with a degree in business management, and has also undertaken a Graduate Diploma in Law, in preparation for his planned post- rugby career as a lawyer.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/16438199 Club career =Newcastle Falcons= A product of the Falcons academy, his third year at the university was completed on a part-time basis due to his rugby commitments. Jonny Wilkinson trained the Kings School first team while Flood was a student there. =Leicester Tigers= On 3 May 2008, it was announced that Flood was set to leave Newcastle Falcons for Leicester Tigers. He was officially confirmed as a Leicester player on 11 June 2008. As a Tigers player, he settled at fly-half, having been switched between centre and fly- half in his career up until then. He was the first to top their points scoring list in a debut season since Dusty Hare in 1976‚Äì77. His debut game was in the first game of the season, against Gloucester, in which he managed to score a try. The shine came off his season, however, when he injured his Achilles tendon in the 2008-09 Heineken Cup semi-final game against Cardiff Blues ‚Äì right before professional rugby's first ever sudden-death kicking competition. He was unable to take part in either of the Tigers' finals that year. The injury ruled Flood out of the first two months of the 2009‚Äì10 season as well, and he returned in November, in a 2009-10 LV= Cup win against Newport Gwent Dragons. He stayed relatively injury-free for the rest of the season, however, and his good form helped the Tigers to top the table. They went on to win the 2009-10 Guinness Premiership final 33‚Äì27 against Saracens. Flood captained the Tigers to victory over fierce rivals Northampton Saints in the 2013 Premiership Rugby final. On 21 December 2013, it was announced that Flood would leave the Tigers. =Toulouse= The Daily Telegraph reported that Toby has signed for Toulouse.The Daily Telegraph article =Return to Newcastle Falcons= On 9 May 2017, it was announced that Flood would return to Newcastle Falcons for the 2017-18 season,http://www.newcastlefalcons.co.uk/news/story/Toby-Flood-returns-to- Newcastle-Falcons signalling a return to his first top-flight club more than 9 years after he left them for Tigers. International career Flood warming up for England In the autumn of 2006, he came on twice as a fly-half replacement for England, his first cap coming in the defeat to Argentina. With Brian Ashton installed as the new England head coach, Flood was selected in the Elite squad for England's 2007 Six Nations campaign. Flood came on as a replacement in the game against to win his fourth England cap. He started his first game for England against at Twickenham and went on to score a try, helping England to a 26‚Äì18 victory. His personal points tally in the match was 16 points. Flood also started in the defeat to . Ashton included Flood in the Elite squad for 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign of France, as a replacement for then Newcastle teammate Jamie Noon. He came on as a substitute in the quarter final against Australia, which England won 12‚Äì10. Flood also came off the bench in the semi final win over France and in the loss in the World Cup final to South Africa. He scored England's opening try in the 2008 Six Nations game against Wales, and managed another the following game against . After acting as a substitute in the first two games of the 2009 Six Nations, Flood started the away game against , and held onto the fly-half jersey for the remaining two wins against France and Scotland. His achilles injury saw him lose it to former clubmate Jonny Wilkinson for the 2009 autumn internationals, but he started the first 2010 Six Nations game against Wales at inside centre, due to an injury to Riki Flutey. He finished the Six Nations once more in possession of the England 10 shirt during the game against France, and retained it for the summer tour. Although England lost the first game, Flood was able to link up with his club colleague Ben Youngs in a strong half-back pairing in the second. A much improved performance saw England beat Australia 20‚Äì21. Flood during 2011 RWC Flood's link with Youngs developed over the autumn internationals, starting with a good display in a loss to New Zealand. The team peaked in the Test against Australia, in which Flood had an immaculate game with the boot. He scored 25 points, which is the most points recorded by an Englishman against the Wallabies. He also helped England to a victory over Samoa, but was injured early into the last game with South Africa, and later revealed he couldn't remember anything after the incident. In the 2011 Six Nations, Flood and Youngs again combined to great success, Flood gaining man of the match for a strong display against Wales at the Millennium Stadium. He was also a key component in several of the tries scored against Italy, developing a key relationship with wing Chris Ashton. Despite Flood's good form for England during their championship winning 2011 six nations he had been dropped for Jonny Wilkinson by the start of the Rugby World Cup 2011. He did however start the Quarter Final defeat to France at no.12. Flood was a hot favourite for the England captaincy when Stuart Lancaster took over from Martin Johnson after the 2011 world cup. However he was not available for much of the 2012 six nations and Owen Farrell seized his chance at fly half. Although Flood did regain the number 10 shirt on the tour to South Africa and in the autumn internationals of that year. A combination of injuries and Lancaster's preference for Owen Farrell's pragmatic approach- as well as Farrell's key role in England's shock win over New Zealand- limited his game time after this. Flood's final start for England was against Italy in the 2013 Six Nations tournament. He effectively ended his England career by signing for Top 14 club Toulouse. In an interview with The Times on 21 August 2017, Flood revealed that he would consider resurrecting his Test career by playing rugby for Germany. Changes to the World Rugby eligibility regulations introduced in 2017 allow a player to make a one-time switch of nationality by playing in an Olympic event for the player's new country, provided that said player has not represented his or her first country for three years and holds nationality in the second country. Flood applied for a German passport following the 2016 Brexit vote, and has already satisfied the three-year stand-down period. Flood can qualify for Germany if he plays for the country in the 2020 Olympics sevens qualifiers, to be held in 2019.

It is the 117th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot Shemp: \\"Boy, if I hadn't ducked, we'd have collided sure. What a narrow escape!\\" The Stooges are running the Cafe Casbah Bah (a Middle Eastern restaurant) and attempting to prepare a meal for customers Hassan Ben Sober (Vernon Dent) and Ginna Rumma (George J. Lewis). The meal turns out disastrous: their spaghetti dinner is spilled all over the customers' faces, so the stooges offer them a replacement meal: rabbit and hot dogs. Because a stray cat and dog make noises at inopportune times while Larry prepares the meal, Larry's meal appears to be actual dog and cat meat, which brings Moe and Shemp great grief when ordered to eat it by their customers. These two customers are thieves intent on robbing the tomb of King Rootintootin, which contains a priceless diamond. Because of their fear of a curse on the diamond, they decide they need three stooges to carry out the deed; the bumbling Moe, Larry and Shemp prove to be perfect for the job. Before ben Sober and Rumma can reveal their scheme, they discover that the Emir of Shmow (Johnny Kascier) has already gotten his hands on the diamond. The two plotters start wailing and, when ben Sober reveals his actual career as a doorman (and not the royalty Moe thinks he is), he and his accomplice are thrown out of the restaurant. The Stooges then attempt to steal the diamond back from the Emir, since it is government property and would likely fetch a large reward. The Stooges arrive at the Emir's palace dressed as Santa Claus. They then manage to acquire the diamond and make a quick exit, but not before dealing with a burly guard (Everett Brown). Cast =Credited= Production notes Malice in the Palace was filmed on June 8‚Äì11, 1948. It was remade in 1956 as Rumpus in the Harem, using ample stock footage from the original. Footage was reused from Wee Wee Monsieur when the Stooges arrive at a palace disguised as Santa Clauses in a sleigh being pulled by a horse wearing reindeer antlers. =Curly Howard's cameo= A thinner Curly (with a full head of hair and false handlebar mustache) as the Chef in Malice in the Palace. His scene was deleted from the final release. According to The Three Stooges Journal, a part was written for Curly Howard after his brief cameo in 1947's Hold That Lion!. The lobby card photo noticeably features a slim, mustachioed Curly as an angry chef. However, his illness caused his scenes to be cut (another story is that Moe Howard decided that \\"The Four Stooges\\" could not be sustained). A scene closely resembling the lobby card is in the finished film (with Hassan ben Sober in Curly's stead); ultimately Larry assumed the role as the chef.Solomon, Jon.

Unlike many more famous ukiyo-e artists, who worked primarily on individual woodblock prints and paintings, Hanbei worked primarily, if not exclusively, in illustrations for woodblock printed books. Alternatively known as Yoshida Sadakichi, his name is also sometimes romanized as Hambei. Hanbei was the first ukiyo-e book illustrator of Kamigata to sign his works. One of the most prolific artists in early ukiyo-e, he produced work for at least ninety different books, amounting to over one thousand individual illustrations. His work appeared in a myriad of texts, including books of j≈çruri puppet plays, Kabuki, novels, travel books, Buddhist subjects, musical texts, and courtesan critiques, among others. He is particularly famous for his illustrations of novels by Saikaku, and for his Joy≈ç Kimm≈ç-zui (Â•≥Áî®Ë®ìËíôÂõ≥ÂΩô, \\"Ladies' Pictorial Encyclopedia\\"), which shows off kimono fashions. Deriving his style from those of the anonymous Kyoto-area illustrators who preceded him, Hanbei's only teacher to be known by name is Sh≈çgor≈ç; however, nothing signed by the teacher remains extant today. As larger-size art books and albums were yet to become common, Hanbei's monochrome works in the restricted medium of book illustrations did not allow him to show great individuality or creativity, outside of a few works of shunga (erotic images) he produced.

The most important was that the six-cylinder engine itself was enlarged slightly in both bore and stroke to dimensions of 69 mm by 100 mm (2.71 inches by 3.94 inches). This gave an engine displacement of 2,216 cc (135 cubic inches) but the actual power of the engine was no greater than that of the 405.

It is held in a private collection in Japan. La Mari√©e was prominently featured in the 1999 film Notting Hill. The painting Chagall paintings often feature young women or couples, but in La Mari√©e the focus is on a singular young woman in quasi-wedding attire with a bouquet of flowers. Described by a Chagall fan as \\"an ode to young love\\", the woman is presented to the viewer in a bold and conspicuous fashion, as if the viewer is the one marrying her. =Colours= The second peculiarity of La Mari√©e compared to the majority of other Chagall paintings is the choice of colors. The young woman is dressed in a red dress lively, with a virginal white veil draped over her head, while the background is mostly a mix of fresh and soft blue and gray. This effect allows the image of the woman to jump off the canvas and attract the viewer's attention. It is evident that Chagall has attempted to highlight the woman, as is tradition in every marriage. =Images in La Mari√©e= The wedding is the major theme of the painting, and includes a feature found in other Chagall paintings and in many other European artworks of the twentieth century, animals playing musical instruments. In this case it's a goat playing a cello. The painting also shows a man hanging over the head of the bride with his hands on her veil, a church which stands in the background almost as an afterthought, a man playing a flute, a girl with pigtails, a fish with arms holding a candle and a chair, several more buildings, and a rooster. Notting Hill In the 1999 film Notting Hill, Julia Roberts' character Anna Scott sees a poster of La Mari√©e in the home of Hugh Grant's character, William Thacker. Later in the film Anna, in proclaiming her love for William, gives him what is presumably the original. According to director Roger Michell in an article in Entertainment Weekly, the painting was chosen because screenwriter Richard Curtis was a fan of Chagall's work, and because La Mari√©e \\"depicts a yearning for something that's lost.\\" Producers had a reproduction made for use in the film, but had to first get permission from the painting's owners and obtain clearance from the British Design and Artists Copyright Society. Finally, according to producer Duncan Kenworthy, \\"... we had to agree to destroy it. They were concerned that if our fake was too good, it might float around the market and create problems.\\" The article notes that the real painting could have been \\"worth between $500,000 and $1 million.\\" Flashes ~ Entertainment Weekly, issue #489 June 11, 1999 A closely related work by Chagall, also called La Mari√©e, was sold in 2003 by Christies for just above $1 million (US).https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/marc-chagall-1887-1985-la- mariee-5493077-details.aspx References Category:1950 paintings Category:Paintings by Marc Chagall Category:Goats in art Category:Musical instruments in art Category:Churches in art Category:Fish in art Category:Squirrels in art Category:Works about wedding ","title":"La Mari√©e"},{"id":"8013734","title":"E.

Horizontal and vertical tutoring The traditional way of organising a secondary school in the UK relies on same-age grouping usually referred to as a year-system. In the USA this is called a grade system. Tutor group sizes may vary but are typicially between 25-30 students all from the same Year or grade. A form tutor, (usually a teacher) is assigned to the tutor group, and has general oversight of their tutees' pastoral and academic needs and usually stays with their form or tutor group throughout the students' time at the school. Tutor time, a short session that tutors and tutees spend together, is usually at the start of the day and lasts about 20 minutes. Schools see this as a settling in time and an opportunity to get basic school administration done. The tutor task is be a mentor to each tutee and act as a guide through the complexities of school life. An alternative tutorial arrangement is vertical tutoring (VT) adopted by many schools in the UK and internationally since 2000. VT schools have chosen to carefully populate tutor groups with students from all age groups changing the way the school organises communications, assessments, and networks of learning. Research by Peter A. Barnard tracks the development of a number of principles and practices emanating from this tranche of schools. These include * Using all available classrooms to reduce group sizes to an optimal number of 18 students * Ensuring that groups are as balanced as possible by gender, ability, behaviour (not friendship) * Ensuring that all staff including support, admin, and leadership team are tutors, i.e. there are two tutors per group * Moving tutor time to the 20 minutes before morning break * Ensuring that all communications are re-routed through tutors who act as information hubs between the school, students, and parents * Revamping the assessment and reporting system to support deep learning conversations between the school, the student, and home * Moving the school from year-based organisation to a house system (a nested or ecological system), restructuring the management system.

Its focus is Ry≈´ Sasakura, a genius bartender who uses his talents to ease the worries and soothe the souls of troubled customers. The manga was first serialized in Shueisha's Japanese seinen magazine Super Jump from 2004 to 2011. The individual chapters were collected by Shueisha and released in twenty-one tank≈çbon volumes. Bartender was later adapted into an anime television series, broadcast in 2006 on Fuji Television. The manga was also adapted into a Japanese television drama in 2011 that aired on TV Asahi. Three spin-off manga have been serialized in Grand Jump and Grand Jump Premium starting from 2012. In Japan, Bartender has sold over 2.8 million copies, while it received a mixed reception from English-language manga and anime publications. Plot Bartender follows the nightlife of (voiced by Takahiro Mizushima in the anime), a bartending prodigy who is said to mix the best cocktails anyone has ever tasted. Upon returning from his studies in France, Ry≈´ works as an assistant for a senior bartender at the bar Lapin. He later opened his own bar, the , which is hidden in a nook of the Ginza district in downtown Tokyo. Rumor holds that potential patrons cannot simply find and enter Eden Hall; rather they must be invited in by the host. Sasakura is known to serve the , a way of saying that he knows just the right drink to serve in a particular situation. The only other regular character is (voiced by Ayumi Fujimura in the anime), the granddaughter of the owner of the Hotel Cardinal, . She is the office lady of the company and requires him to compete for the job of bartender in the hotel. Ry≈´ is initially rejected by , the manager of the hotel beverage department. However, upon Miwa insistence, Taizo meets Ry≈´ and becomes fascinated by his abilities, requesting her to insist on Ry≈´ to bring him to work in the hotel. Over the course of the manga, various other figures, all of whom share unusual troubles and heavy burdens, are invited into Eden Hall and are treated to Sasakura's fine drinks, which, with guidance from the young bartender, lead the customers to reflect upon their lives and decide on a course of action to tackle their problems. Themes Bartender is predominantly an episodic series, and although the clients and problems vary, each story revolves around problems being resolved through the right drink. Alcohol is not depicted as a potential problem that might have negative effects such as drunkenness in the series; instead, \\"Bartender insists the right drink at the right time ... is about starting an earnest conversation with oneself.\\" To know which beverage is the most appropriate, according to the series, a bartender must be more than a liquor connoisseur; he or she must be a good observer. For example, Ry≈´ can deduce one's feelings by looking at one's hands and can know if someone is telling the truth or not. As such, it is not just about drinking; \\"the stories of the customers are sometimes, if not almost always, as important as and at times even parallel to the history of the liquors imbibed.\\" Publication The Bartender manga was written by Araki Joh, illustrated by Kenji Nagatomo, and serialized in Shueisha's biweekly seinen magazine Super Jump between May 2004 and September 2011. With Super Jumps cancellation, the series moved to the then‚Äìnew Grand Jump, in which Bartender was serialized during November and December 2011. Its chapters were eventually collected into twenty-one volumes, with the first volume released on December 3, 2004, and the final volume on February 17, 2012. The series is licensed by Haksan Publishing in South Korea, and by Sharp Point Press in Taiwan. An , which follows Ry≈´'s return from Paris, was released into four parts, with the first two volumes released on September 18, 2014 and the last two volumes on October 17, 2014. A spin-off series titled Bartender √† Paris, with a new protagonist, , began in Grand Jump on January 4, 2012; Nagatomo was replaced by Osamu Kajisa for the series. It was collected into six volumes; the first was published on June 19, 2012, and the last on December 19, 2013. A follow-up, Bartender √† Tokyo, began in the same magazine on November 6, 2013, and was later moved to Grand Jump Premium on December 24, 2015. It was collected into eight volumes; the first was released on April 18, 2014, and the last on October 19, 2016. Both Bartender √† Paris and Bartender √† Tokyo were licensed in Taiwan by Sharp Point Press. A fourth series, Bartender 6stp, was serialized on Grand Jump Premium and Grand Jump Mucha from August 24, 2016 to December 25, 2019. The 6stp first volume was published on March 17, 2017, and the latest‚Äîthe fourth volume‚Äîwas released on February 19, 2020. Anime adaptation Bartender was adapted into an eleven episode anime series directed by Masaki Watanabe, written by Yasuhiro Imagawa, and produced by Palm Studio. The anime uses New Wave film methods, including breaking the fourth wall, \\"stagy narration, [and] odd transitions\\". It also explores staging techniques, such as monologues, spotlights, and half-screens showing storyteller and narrated story at the same time. It was broadcast on Fuji TV with the first episode airing on October 15, 2006, and the last episode airing on December 31, 2006. Pony Canyon compiled the series and released it on five separate DVDs between December 20, 2006 and April 18, 2007. Anime Limited announced at MCM London Comic Con 2018 that they had acquired the series for release in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Anime Limited also holds the license in North America, and will distribute the series in partnership with Shout! Factory within the region. It will be released on January 19, 2021.https://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/shout-anime-ltd- serve-up-cult-fave-bartender-in-15th-anniversary-collectors-edition/ The music for Bartender was composed by Kaoruko ≈åtake, and subsequently released on an official soundtrack album on November 29, 2006 produced by Sony Music Japan under the DefStar Records label. Both the opening theme, \\"Bartender\\", and the ending theme, , were performed by Natural High. The opening theme, however, featured Junpei Shiina. Both themes were released by Sony as the single \\"Hajimari no Hito/Bartender\\" on December 13, 2006. Television drama In November 2010, through the 24th issue of Super Jump, it was announced that a live-action Japanese television drama of Bartender would be produced, starring Masaki Aiba, who had been training with a professional bartender since September of that year, and Shihori Kanjiya. Directed by Osamu Katayama and written by Natsuko Takahashi, the new series aired on TV Asahi's \\"Friday Night Drama\\" time slot from February 4, 2011 to April 1, 2011. The series theme song, \\"Lotus\\", was performed by Arashi, a boy band of which Aiba is a member. On August 5, 2011, during an event at the Tokyo Tower, TC Entertainment released all episodes of the Bartender drama in DVD and Blu-ray box sets. Several tie-in products were also released, including straps, cups, pens, and candles. Reception Bartender had sold more than 2.8 million copies in Japan as of January 2011; individual volumes frequently appeared on lists of best-selling manga in that country. The anime television series finale obtained a 3.4 percent television viewership rating, making it the fourth most‚Äìwatched anime‚Äìrelated program that week. The television drama debut had an 11 percent television viewership rating, while its finale earned an 11.7 rating. Its DVD box set sold 7,978 copies, considered a \\"successful\\" number by TV Asahi, and its related merchandise also \\"sold well.\\" At Nikkan Sports Drama Grand Prix, Bartender was voted the fourth‚Äìbest drama, and Masaki the third‚Äìbest actor in a drama. The television series also received coverage from the Nippon Bartenders Association. David Welsh, in The Manga Curmudgeon, declared the way Ryu used liquor to help other people \\"a beautiful, uplifting message for a comic. Okay, maybe not, but it sounds like a lot of fun.\\" At Ani-Gamers, a reviewer known as \\"Ink\\" wrote that the series unduly \\"romanticizes\\" a bar, but praised its storytelling and staging techniques, the narration, its \\"casual dialog and effective visuals\\", and its balance. He described it as \\"a love letter to liquor as opposed to the consumption thereof,\\" while Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network (ANN) called it \\"a delicious ode to mixology\\". Michael Toole, also for ANN, wrote that although it is \\"pretty cheesy...there is something deeply, compulsively watchable about Bartender in spite of its plainness. It's gentle and sentimental, with powerful and surprising transitions.\\" Writing for THEM Anime Reviews, Tim Jones called it \\"an interesting concept for an anime.\\" Jones asserted that the animation was not \\"all that stellar\\", but commented that the drinks in CG \\"look quite good.\\" He found the character designs \\"fairly generic\\" except for Ry≈´, and the music \\"a little repetitive\\" over the 11 episodes, although he stressed that it \\"fits the atmosphere of the show.\\" On the other hand, ANN's Carl Kimlinger criticized Bartender's concept \\"as insipid, silly, and downright awful\\" and \\"monumentally uninspired\\". He praised its animation but said \\"no stylistic elaboration on earth can save it from boring its audience to tears\\". Erin Finnegan from the same site dubbed its graphics \\"craptastic\\" and called the idea of solving individuals' problems through drinks \\"cheesy.\\" References External links *Official TV Asahi live action adaptation webpage *Official Shueisha webpage *Official Fuji TV anime adaptation webpage * Category:2004 manga Category:2011 Japanese television series debuts Category:2011 Japanese television series endings Category:Bartending Category:Comics set in Tokyo Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Seinen manga Category:Sharp Point Press titles Category:Shueisha franchises Category:Shueisha manga Category:TV Asahi television dramas Category:Works about alcohol ","title":"Bartender (manga)"},{"id":"8013864","text":"is a Japanese writer. Background and education Ogawa was born in Okayama, Okayama Prefecture, graduated from Waseda University, and lives in Ashiya, Hy≈çgo, with her husband and son. Career Since 1988, Ogawa has published more than fifty works of fiction and nonfiction. In 2006 she co-authored \\"An Introduction to the World's Most Elegant Mathematics\\" with Masahiko Fujiwara, a mathematician, as a dialogue on the extraordinary beauty of numbers. Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe has said, \\"Yoko Ogawa is able to give expression to the most subtle workings of human psychology in prose that is gentle yet penetrating.\\" The subtlety in part lies in the fact that Ogawa's characters often seem not to know why they are doing what they are doing. She works by accumulation of detail, a technique that is perhaps more successful in her shorter works; the slow pace of development in the longer works requires something of a deus ex machina to end them. The reader is presented with an acute description of what the protagonists, usually female, observe and feel and their somewhat alienated self-observations, some of which reflect Japanese society and especially women's roles within it. The tone of her works varies, across the works and sometimes within the longer works, from the surreal, through the grotesque and the ‚Äîsometimes grotesquely‚Äî humorous, to the psychologically ambiguous and even disturbing. (Hotel Iris, one of her longer works, is more explicit sexually than her other works and is also her most widely translated.) A film in French, L'Annulaire (The Ringfinger), based in part on Ogawa's Kusuriyubi no hy≈çhon (Ëñ¨Êåá„ÅÆÊ®ôÊú¨), was released in France in June 2005. Her novel The Housekeeper and the Professor was made into the movie The Professor's Beloved Equation.

His epitaph in the church of that place described him as \\"in years a youth, mature in wisdom and in virtue venerable\\". Despite his short life, he gave proof in his writings of considerable learning and won remarkable popularity by his pulpit utterances. He was seventeen years old when he entered the Order of Preachers. After teaching philosophy for a time at Albi, and theology at Toulouse, he began a career of preaching as brilliant as it was brief.

Time and place As with most Sanskrit poets, very few concrete details are available about Bharavi's life, and inferences must be made from references to him. His name, along with great poet and dramatist in the Sanskrit language KƒÅlidƒÅsa's name, is mentioned in a Chalukya stone inscription dated 634 C.E. found at Aihole, located in present day Karnataka. In another inscription, the king Durvinita of the Western Ganga Dynasty mentions having written a commentary on the fifteenth canto of Bharavi's KirƒÅtƒÅrjunƒ´ya. The Western Ganga Dynasty ruled from about the middle of the fourth century, and Durvinita is usually believed to have lived in the later half of the sixth century. The poet Da·πá·∏çin, who was born during the seventh century, reports that his great- grandfather was a friend of Bharavi and was introduced by him to a king Vi·π£·πáuvardhana, before receiving patronage from Durvinita and King Simhavishnu of the Pallava dynasty. This is unlikely to be Vishnuvardhana II (673‚Äì682 CE) and is more likely to be Yasodharman Vishnuvardhana, placing Bharavi's floruit in . Bharavi probably belonged to Southern India.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Bharavi\\" means \\"lustre of the sun\\". It is reported that his original name was DƒÅmodara, although this may have been an error. Work The KirƒÅtƒÅrjunƒ´ya, an epic poem in eighteen cantos, is his only known work. It \\"is regarded to be the most powerful poem in the Sanskrit language\\". A. K. Warder considers it the \\"most perfect epic available to us\\", over A≈õvagho·π£a's Buddhacarita, noting his greater force of expression, with more concentration and polish in every detail. Despite using extremely difficult language and rejoicing in the finer points of Sanskrit grammar, he achieves conciseness and directness. His alliteration, \\"crisp texture of sound\\", and choice of metre closely correspond to the narrative. His poetry is characterised by its intricate styles and ethereal expressions. Like Kalidasa for his similes (upamƒÅ) and Da·πá·∏çin for his wordplay (padalƒÅlityam), Bharavi is known for his \\"weight of meaning\\" (arthagauravam). He influenced the 8th century CE poet Magha.

The bill returned a number of offences from the Zina Ordinance to the Pakistan Penal Code, where they had been before 1979, and created an entirely new set of procedures governing the prosecution of the offences of adultery and fornication, whipping and amputation were removed as punishments. The law meant women would not be jailed if they were unable to prove rape, and allows rape to be proved on grounds other than witnesses, such as forensics and DNA evidence. The Bill remains controversial amongst many people in Pakistan who argue it does not go far enough as stoning to death is still theoretically on a punishment, though not implemented by the courts, some argue it should be removed entirely. However, some religious parties have called the bill Un-Islamic and by extension unconstitutional, however the Supreme Court of Pakistan has not overturned the Bill on the grounds that it violates the Islamic provisions in Pakistan's constitution, hence stands to the present day. Pakistan's province, Punjab passed another women's bill which instituted further reforms this is pending before the courts on grounds of unconstitutionality. In 2010 the Federal Shariat Court declared that several clauses in this Bill were repugnant to Shariat and overturned them. Those clauses were thereby rendered void.https://tribune.com.pk/story/93167/shariat-court-terms-women-protection- act-clauses-repugnant/https://www.dawn.com/news/592999/shariat-court-knocks- out-3-sections-of-women-s-protection-act Impact The Hudood Ordinances, enacted by military ruler Zia ul-Haq in 1979, criminalise adultery and non- marital consensual sex. They also made a rape victim liable to prosecution for adultery if she cannot produce male witnesses to the assault. However, According to Mufti Taqi Usmani, who was instrumental in the creation of the ordinances: > If anyone says that she was punished because of Qazaf (false accusation of > rape) then Qazaf Ordinance, Clause no. 3, Exemption no. 2 clearly states > that if someone approaches the legal authorities with a rape complaint, she > cannot be punished in case she is unable to present four witnesses. No court > of law can be in its right mind to award such a punishment. A 2003 report by the National Commission on Status of Women (NCSW) estimated \\"80% of women\\" were incarcerated because \\"they had failed to prove rape charges and were consequently convicted of adultery.\\"Jails and prisoners, State of Human Rights 2004, HRCP 1500 women are \\"believed to be in jail in March\\" in 2003 according to the HRCP report.Hudood Ordinance ‚Äì The Crime And Punishment For Zina amnesty.orgIn 2003 the National Commission on Status of Women estimated 1500 women were in prison, but according to another report (statistics compiled by the Society for Advancement of Community Health Education and Training (SACHET) and Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) Team for Karachi Women Prison) 7000 women and children were kept in extremely poor conditions in 75 jails in 2003‚Äì2004 (sources: Violence against Women and Impediments in Access to JusticePakistan: Pakistani religious law challenged) According to legal scholar Martin Lau > While it was easy to file a case against a woman accusing her of adultery, > the Zina Ordinance made it very difficult for a woman to obtain bail pending > trial. Worse, in actual practice, the vast majority of accused women were > found guilty by the trial court only to be acquitted on appeal to the > Federal Shariat Court. By then they had spent many years in jail, were > ostracized by their families, and had become social outcasts.Lau, \\"Twenty- > Five Years of Hudood Ordinances\\", 2007: p.1296 Attention to the Ordinance and suggestions for revising it were given by a number of government appointed commissions, a televised several weeks-long- televised debate on the subject of \\"No debate on Hudood Allah (Allah's laws as prescribed in Quran and Sunnah)-is the Hudood Ordinance (Man's interpretation of Allah's law) Islamic?\\" on Geo television channel, and a 2005 University of Karachi Dept of Public Administration workshop. The new Women's Protection Bill brings rape under the Pakistan Penal Code, which is based on civil law, not Sharia (Islamic law). The Bill removes the right of police to detain people suspected of having sex outside of marriage, instead requiring a formal accusation in court. Under the changes, adultery and non-marital consensual sex is still an offence but now judges would be allowed to try rape cases in criminal rather than Islamic courts. That does away with the need for witnesses (Hadd punishment) and allows convictions to be made on the basis of forensic and circumstantial evidence (Tazir punishment). The amendments change the punishment for someone convicted of having consensual sex outside marriage to imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of Rs 10,000.Lau, \\"Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances\\", 2007: p.1308 Rape would be punishable with 10 to 25 years of imprisonment but with death or life imprisonment if committed by two or more persons together, while adultery would remain under the Hudood ordinance and is punishable with stoning to death. A complaint of adultery must be made to a judge with at least four witnesses testifying under oath that they witnessed the act of penetration.Lau, \\"Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances\\", 2007: p.1308-12 It is the change in the punishment for fornication and rape which is the major source of controversy. The Bill also outlaws statutory rape i.e. sex with girls under the age of 16. Controversy Under the Hudood Ordinance, women were routinely jailed for adultery on flimsy evidence, often when a former husband refused to recognise a divorce. It is alleged that the legislation led to thousands of women being imprisoned without being proved whether they were actually guilty. This risk of imprisonment, it is contended, has kept many women from trying to bring their attackers to justice. The Commission of Inquiry on Women, headed by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, had recommended the repeal of the Hudood Ordinances in 1997, as did the National Commission on the Status of Women in 2002. The Women's Protection Bill is intended to amend Hudood Ordinance to address these issues. On the other hand, the bill has been fiercely criticised by Islamist groups in Pakistan, and religious parties boycotted the parliamentary vote on the bill on the basis that it was inaugurating an era of \\"free sex.\\" The Religious political parties argue that the bill goes against articles 2a and 227 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which state respectively that \\"Islam will be the state religion\\" and \\"No laws will be passed which are repugnant to the Quran and sunnah.\\" Ayman al-Zawahiri of al-Qaeda warned Pakistanis in a video released in April 2006 that the bill was an attempts to erode Pakistan's adultery law and part of a \\"Crusader\\" plot to portray Islam as a religion of \\"enlightened moderation\\".

Plot introduction The book begins with Gaius Julius Caesar's Egyptian campaign in Alexandria, his final battles with the Republicans led by Metellus Scipio, Cato the Younger, Titus Labienus and the brothers Pompeius in Africa and Spain, and ultimately Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March by Marcus Brutus, Gaius Cassius and the Liberators. The latter stages of The October Horse chronicle the death of Cicero, the emergence of Octavian and his battles with Mark Antony, and conclude with the Battle of Philippi. =Explanation of the novel's title= The title of the book comes from a peculiar chariot race in Rome on the Ides of October, after which the right- hand horse of the winning team was sacrificed to the Roman gods. Then two teams, one from the Subura and the other from the Via Sacra, competed for the Horse's head.

Established in 1993 as an alternative to the Der Spiegel weekly news magazine, since 2015 the editorial staff has been headquartered in Germany's capital of Berlin. Alongside Spiegel and Stern, Focus is one of the three most widely circulated German weeklies. The concept originated from Hubert Burda and Helmut Markwort, who went from being Editor-in-chief to become publisher in 2009 and since 2017 has been listed in the publication's masthead as Founding Editor-in-chief. The current Editor-in-chief of Focus as of March 2016 is Robert Schneider.  History  Under the code name \\"Zugmieze\\", work commenced on Focus in the summer of 1991. In October 1992, Hubert Burda Media announced plans for a new weekly news magazine. Observers initially gave the project only little chance for success. Several attempts of other publishers to establish a competitor to Spiegel and Stern magazines had previously failed. The first edition arrived on the newsstands on January 18, 1993 and was already sold out on the next day. The subline of the Focus was \\"the modern news magazine\\", and Helmut Markwort became the magazine's first Editor-in- chief. The lead story on the alleged comeback of Hans-Dietrich Genscher as the successor of Richard von Weizs√§cker in the office of the Federal President was later proven to be a canard. There was an equal mix of positive and negative reviews: Whereas journalists tended to take a critical view towards Focus, advertisers had consistently favorable responses. Observers saw in Focus above all a challenger of Spiegel, whereas the publisher viewed US magazines such as Newsweek and Time as its role model. After five issues, Focus had some 15,000 subscribers, and with circulation of over 300,000 copies sold, it was a commercial success from the beginning. The magazine played a decisive role in the expansion of Hubert Burda Media's market position. In mid-1994, a Dutch court ruled that due to brand disputes, Focus was no longer allowed to be sold in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Unfazed by this, Focus continued its growth strategy, later even occasionally eclipsing Spiegel in advertising sales. Burda further enhanced its international profile, for example, through a cooperation agreement with the US media group, Ziff Davis. The year 1996 saw the launch of the Internet portal, Focus Online, and under the name of Focus TV, the group entered into production of TV content. Focus developed into one of the leading German news magazines. In 1997, its publisher, Hubert Burda, was lauded for the magazine's \\"creative and groundbreaking innovations\\", among other accolades. Over the first five years of its existence, Focus repeatedly created a sensation with its interviews of key celebrities, e.g. in 1996 with real estate mogul J√ºrgen Schneider after his arrest, or in 1997 with Leo Kirch in the aftermath of his media group's collapse. The Focus concept was also successfully adapted outside of Europe, e.g. in the form of √âpoca magazine by the Brazilian media house Grupo Globo. At the beginning of 1999, Focus for the first time achieved higher readership than Spiegel, and in the years to follow, managed to further expand its lead position. The year 2000 saw the launch of Focus Money, an off-shoot of the news magazine, dedicated to business and financial topics. In 2001, a division for Internet topics was created at Focus, in addition to pooling Internet activities of Focus Digital in the joint venture, Tomorrow Focus. Thus, the Focus magazine publishing company was once again primarily responsible for printed publications, yet participated in Tomorrow Focus. In 2004 the first personnel changes occurred at Focus: In addition to his duties as Editor-in-chief, Helmut Markwort also assumed the position of publisher, and Uli Baur was promoted from Deputy Editor-in-chief to Editor-in-chief. Under the new leadership, in 2005 Focus teamed up with H√∂rverlag, an audio publisher, to create the download portal Claudio for audio books. In 2006, Focus became embroiled in the journalist scandal of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the German Intelligence Services. In exchange for money and benefits in kind, several journalists had offered the intelligence agency to collect and disclose information on investigative journalists and their sources. The German Intelligence Services in turn put Focus journalists under observation as informants. Irrespective of the public debate surrounding the affair, Focus continued its development, yet like all news magazines, was grappling with declining circulation. At the end of 2009, it was announced that Helmut Markwort was stepping down as Editor-in-chief. Wolfram Weimer, founder of the political magazine Cicero, was appointed as his successor. Observers saw in Markwort's departure a fundamental \\"change in direction\\". Even prior to Weimer's taking up his duties, the publisher staged a relaunch of Focus. After only one year, Weimer left Focus and his position was left unfilled, which lead to Baur becoming the sole Editor-in-chief. According to media reports, publisher Markwort and Baur had \\"rejected\\" the new direction of the Focus and \\"ultimately obstructed it more and more heavily\\". Weimer was said to have wanted to position the magazine as \\"more up-market and more political\\". The paid circulation of single copies \\"more and more heavily\\" declined under Weimer's and Baur's leadership, dropping below the 100,000 mark. In 2013, J√∂rg Quoos took over as Editor-in-chief of the magazine, and Baur became publisher. Quoos gave Focus a more political orientation and, in particular, reduced the share of practical tips. For example, the magazine ran an expos√© on soccer manager Uli Hoeness's voluntary disclosure of his tax evasion and landed the scoop on the so-called \\"Nazi-era treasure trove\\" of art collector Cornelius Gurlitt. In 2014, Ulrich Reitz followed as new Editor-in- chief, as the publisher and Quoos had a difference in opinion on the future direction of the magazine. Among other steps, Reitz completed the process initiated under Quoos, relocating Focus from Munich to Berlin in the year 2015. Only a small editorial staff remained in the Bavarian state capital. In 2016, there was again a change at the head of the editorial staff: Robert Schneider, formerly Editor-in-chief of Superillu, replaced Reitz, who remained until the end of the year, responsible for the topics of politics and debate. In 2017, Focus announced the closure of its offices in Munich and D√ºsseldorf, along with reorganizations in the editorial staff. Since then, the magazine is now created completely in Berlin. Later in the year, Hubert Burda Media launched a broad-based reader campaign entitled \\"Menschen im Focus\\" (people in focus).  Circulation  Focus is one of the most widely circulated news magazines and has a proportionally large share in the advertising market. Like Spiegel and Stern, Focus has sustained significant declines over the past years, however, dropping from 782,685 to 438,055 sold copies from the 4th quarter of 1998 to the 2nd quarter of 2017. Individual sales experience relatively wide fluctuation, depending upon the cover story. The share of subscriptions in the paid circulation is currently roughly 37%, recently increasing slightly.  Profile  While Focus positioned itself as a news magazine alongside Spiegel, the latter in turn decidedly distanced itself from Focus, dismissively referring to it as the \\"Munich Illustrated\\", among other things. Both publications differ in their editorial approaches: Spiegel puts an emphasis on complex political, economic and social analysis, whereas Focus, in addition to political reporting, also caters to topics of everyday relevance from the realms of family, health, finances and career. However, Spiegel has recently published more articles featuring practical tips, modeled after Focus. With comparatively shorter texts, more graphics, more impactful visuals and ranking lists, readers are offered information that is easier to absorb. From the beginning, journalism offering practical tips has been an essential element of Focus. According to the news magazine's own statements, its target group includes people who \\"are involved in society, in politics and in their professions, thanks to their active processing of information and especially due to their strong appetite for information\\". When the magazine launched, observers referred to this group as \\"info elites\\". Focus is generally considered to be in the mainstream civil political spectrum.  Criticism  Major controversy erupted over a Focus story on a mission involving Germany's elite counter-terror unit, GSG 9, in the village of Bad Kleinen, leading to staff offices being searched in January 1994. Law enforcement authorities investigated the magazine because confidential sources had been quoted, e.g. an assessment report from the Federal Criminal Police Office, the Bundeskriminalamt, and the pocket agenda of the killed RAF terrorist, Wolfgang Grams. According to information by Stern, documents found in Focus offices provided the decisive clue to identifying the informant. In 1995, Focus reported on business difficulties involving the Hamburg private bank, Mody. As a result, it experienced a bank run by many depositors, and one day after the magazine article appeared, the bank had to close its doors until further notice. The shareholders subsequently held Focus directly responsible for the illiquidity. The Press Tribunal of the Hamburg District Court concurred, ordering Focus to pay restitution for damages. In appeal proceedings, this decision was reversed by Hamburg's Higher Regional Court, and Germany's Federal Court of Justice denied the plaintiff's appeal on points of law. Focus welcomed the end of the legal disputes as a \\"victory for freedom of the press\\". A study at the TU Dresden university from the year 2014 involved research on the synchronization of news and advertising. Researchers found that, both in Spiegel and Focus, reporting on companies was more frequent, friendlier and more frequently mentioned products, the more the companies purchased advertising. Focus reporting on the 2015‚Äì16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany created controversy. The cover page showed hand prints in black paint on a white, naked woman; it was criticized as a \\"naked insult\\" and considered \\"racist\\". Unlike the German daily newspaper, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, which had also caused an uproar with a polarizing depiction, Focus refused to apologize and justified the cover as a symbolic depiction of \\"what happened in Cologne\\". The German Press Council received several complaints about Focus, but rejected all of them.

Wall's diplomatic career lasted more than thirty years, but his writing career as Sarban was brief and not prolific, ending during the early 1950s. Sarban is described in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy as \\"a subtle, literate teller of tales, conscious of the darker and less acceptable implications that underlie much popular literature\\". Wall cited the supernatural fiction of Arthur Machen and Walter de la Mare as influences on his work.\\"Sarban\\" by Peter Nicholls, in Supernatural Fiction Writers edited by E. F. Bleiler. Scribner's,New York, 1985. (pp.667-674), . Early life Wall was born in Mexborough in Yorkshire, the son of George William Wall, a passenger guard on the Great Central Railway, and Maria Ellen (n√©e Moffatt) Wall. After Mexborough School, he studied English at Jesus College, Cambridge and received first-class honors. He also studied Arabic and took the Consular Service Examination. Wall married Eleanor Alexander Riesle on 20 January 1950 and they had one daughter. Wall and his wife were separated legally during 1971. Diplomatic service He chose a diplomatic career in the Near East because \\"[James Elroy] Flecker, whose poetry I had loved in my school days, had been in the Levant Consular Service\\", and owing to \\"a liking for travel and oriental philology\\".\\"Time, A Falconer\\" by Mark Valentine, Tartarus Press, 2010. During 1933, Wall was posted initially as Probationer Vice-Consul at Beirut, Lebanon. Subsequently, he was stationed at Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, Tabriz and Esfahan in Iran, and Casablanca in Morocco. After WWII, he was Counsellor at the British Middle East Office in Cairo until 1952. He was British Ambassador to Paraguay 1957-8 and Consul-General at Alexandria 1963-5. He was honoured in 1953 as a Companion of the Order of St Michael & St George for his diplomatic work. Wall continued to work for the Foreign Office, at first in a teaching position in London, 1966‚Äì1970, and then at the Government Communications Headquarters, a secret surveillance centre, in Cheltenham. Wall retired from the Foreign Office during 1977, and retired to Monmouthshire. Literary works Sarban's most famous literary work is the alternative- history novel The Sound of His Horn (1952), which presupposes that the Nazis have won the Second World War and built parks where they hunt genetically altered humans for sport. Sarban also published two collections of fantasy stories: Ringstones and Other Curious Tales (1951) and The Doll Maker and Other Tales of the Uncanny (1953). The Sacrifice and Other Stories (2002) collects four novellas, two of which, the title story and \\"The Sea-Things\\", appeared in print for the first time, while \\"Number Fourteen\\" had been published in a later edition of Ringstones, and \\"The King of the Lake\\" had been added to a later edition of The Sound of His Horn. Further previously unpublished work, including poems, a one-act play, extracts from two novels and unpublished stories, has been collected in Discovery of Heretics (2010).

In 1749, the Tavern was owned by William Curnock and shortly afterwards by Robert Bartholomew (died 1766), the Surrey cricketer.F S Ashley-Cooper, At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751, Cricket Magazine, 1900 In 1750, the same Robert Bartholomew played for Surrey versus Kent at Dartford Brent, Kent winning by 3 wickets. At the time of his death in 1766, Robert Bartholomew was the master of the Angel Inn at Islington and also of White Conduit House.G B Buckley, Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket, Cotterell, 1937 The Chertsey Bartholomews Two more Bartholomews played for Chertsey Cricket Club and appeared on scorecards in the 1770s. It is not known if they were related to Robert or to each other, though it is highly likely. On the cards of three Chertsey matches in the 1775 English cricket season, they are recorded as \\"Rev Bartholomew senior\\" and \\"Mr Bartholomew junior\\". It is believed that the junior was William Bartholomew, who also played for Surrey teams at the time, including matches in 1773 for which scorecards have survived. The senior is believed to be the Reverend Charles Bartholomew, a Chertsey Club stalwart who played occasionally in the 1770s but may have been a regular in times past..

Coat of arms of the General Santander National Police Academy. General Santander National Police Academy (or Escuela General Santander de la Policia Nacional in Spanish) is the main educational center for the Colombian National Police. The academy functions as a university for the formation of its force. History The institution was created by the Colombian National Police with the main function of instructing recruits to become officers, enlisted, agents, detectives and other technical and administrative services. It was formally restructured by the presidential Decree 343 of 21 February 1940 during the mandate of president Eduardo Santos in an effort to shape the institution into a more efficient entity with the support of Decree 776 of 14 April which set the dotation needed per personnel, unified and assigned more objective functions to the police force. Decree 343 also set Luis Andr√©s G√≥mez as the first director of the institution, who assigned the staff personnel for it, as also established in the Decree 77610. One of his main purposes was to achieve a status of university for the Colombian policemen. The institution initially offered four courses with the requirement of having a previous intellectual preparation, professional attitude, moral attitude and the vocation to become a policeman. G√≥mez also initiates a selection process to hire highly prepared Professors from the Law Faculty of the National University of Colombia, selecting Copete Lizarralde, Arturo Valencia Zea, Adolfo V√©lez Echeverri, Augusto Sastre, Alfonso Ruiz Ojeda, Mois√©s Spath Nerel, Guillermo Mel√©ndez Ram√≠rez, Jos√© Alejandro Mantilla and Guillermo Fern√°ndez. Luis Alberto Pinz√≥n directed the Studies Prefecture along with Ricardo Rodr√≠guez Aranza, Francisco Bruno, Miguel Lleras Pizarro, Roberto Pineda Castillo, Ernesto Antol√≠nez, Jos√© Manuel Mosquera, Enrique Vargas and Jorge Valencia. The first class was named Simon Bolivar in honor of El Libertador. Emiliano Camargo Rodr√≠guez was assigned as the class commander and Luis A. C√°rdenas and Rey Prato as section commanders. The courses focused on instruction on civility, Colombian geography, Colombian constitution, Police code, Penal code and proceedings, typing, topography, Forensics, organisation and documentation, leadership school, military doctrine, Equestrianism and Hippology. With the Decree 421 of 28 February, the Alumni Department is organized and assigned to the General Santander National Police Academy with the mission of forming professional National Police functionaries in its different areas, everything ruled by the Alumni Council. Decree 1187 of 15 May established National Police ranks for detectives, in an ascendant order and depending on time in rank. Fourth Class detectives, 2 years in rank; Third Class detectives, 3 years in rank; Second Class detectives, 4 years in rank; First Class Detectives and Detective in Chief with an additional requirement of a major in law or previously been an Instructional Judge. Non-commissioned officers and sub-lieutenants were allowed as Fourth Class detectives if they reached the condition needed of being younger than 35 years old. By this same time a Detective Promotions board was established and conformed by the Director of the National Police, the Secretary of the National Police, the Director of the National Department of Security, the Director of the General Santander Academy and the Personnel Department Chief. These detectives were sorted internally into different promotional categories taking in consideration the time in grade, professional aptitudes, instruction and conduct observed in the institution. On 5 August 1938, President Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo officially inaugurates the General Santander National Police Academy Buildings. In 1939 the Alumni Department is created to lead the preparation, formation and education of the National Police regular personnel and improve administrative and technical services. By Decree 343 of 21 February 1940 the Academy is finally organized. Since the Colombian National Ministry of Education approved the academic programs of \\"Police Studies\\" and \\"Police Administration\\" by resolution Number 9354 of 25 October 1976 the Academy is authorized to operate as a Higher Education Institution. Initially the Police Administrator formation was designed to go through a system of cycles lasting 20 weeks each. By the end of the fourth cycle the recruit changed of status, from cadet to sub-lieutenant (aka alf√©rez) rank that would be held for 40 weeks more in order to receive the grade of \\"Police Administrator technician\\", then return to classes and go through the last three cycles in order to receive the title of \\"Professional Police Administrator\\" and receive further promotion to advanced rank grades; captain, major, etc. The Academy always considers three fields for formation in its plan of study; professional, scientific/investigative and humane/social. Each field divided into subfields and subjects in order to achieve a speciality knowledge. by mandate of the Colombian Institute for the Promotion of Higher Education (ICFES) in resolution 1721 of 1982 the academy's license remains effective until 1987. By resolution 0161 of January 26 the National Police Directorate approves a new \\"Study Plan\\" which includes a renovated University formation program featuring an extension to the length of formation time to total an entire year. By 1991 the Academy begins and develops the Police \\"professionalization\\". By resolution 02891 of October 2, 1991, The ICFES approves a reform to the \\"Study Plan\\" to change the name of \\"Police Studies Technology\\" into \\"Criminalistics and Police Technology\\", plan that would last until 11 September 1997 when by resolution 02668, the Colombian Ministry of Defense and the National Police Directorate approve a new \\"Study Plan\\" that remains in effect. The new \\"Study Plan\\" program lasts for three years and it is distributed into six academic semesters. It contains two indoctrine fields: Police fundamentals and the complementary, this last one subdivided into legal, administrative and investigative areas. The current curriculum is focused on improving essentially the professional police indoctrination on human rights, ethical and legal principles focused on civil liberties and warranties for Colombian citizens. By resolution 2252 of 17 August 2000 the Academy was authorized to credit the Criminalistic (Forensic Sciences) Program.

It can be found in the Amazon basin of Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, and can also be found in the Guianan Region of Venezuela and the Guianas, and in Cerrado of the state of Maranh√£o in Brazil.  Description  Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The dorsum is lime green whereas the belly is white to yellow-white or cream. Lower lips, chest and front legs bear sparse white spots with dark frames; these are more dense on the flanks and hind legs. Fingers are transparent brown and have large, green adhesive discs. There is a prominent gland extending from behind each eye over the tympanum. The iris is dark gray.  Distribution  It is found throughout the Amazon Rain forest of northern Bolivia, western and northern Brazil, south-eastern Colombia, eastern Peru, southern and eastern Venezuela, and the Guianas. Occasionally, it is also found in the riparian forest area of the Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna ecoregion of Brazil. Habitat and behaviour P. bicolor seated. Phyllomedusa bicolor is a nocturnal, arboreal frog. Males call from trees in tropical humid forests. Males fight each other for mating rights by using their heads to attempt to separate another male who is attached to a female. Males fend off rivals using a series of aggressive calls and use their hind legs to push away the rival. During mating season, males may be targeted more by predators as the fights between males very vocal and can be easily heard by predators. However, to combat this, Phyllomedusa bicolor produce peptides in their skin that serves as a chemical defense. Phyllomedusa bicolor reproduce like most frog species through amplexus, where the male climbs onto the females back to fertilize the eggs. Female and male construct a leaf-nest above forest pools, where the eggs are laid in a gelatinous mass of about 70 cm above the water. The eggs hatch from these nests approximately 14 days and the tadpoles fall into the water, where they continue the development into adult frogs. Peak reproduction occurs during the rainy season. Eggs of Phyllomedusa bicolor are heavily predated and have a predation rate of up to 61%. Species that prey on the eggs include Staphilynid beetles, phorid flies, mammals, specifically Cebus apella, and other predators such as snakes. The eggs are predated because they are source of protein for predators. Conservation The IUCN endangered species database lists them in the \\"Least Concern\\" category, in view of their current wide distribution and large population. Medicinal use The skin secretion of the frog is known as Vacina do sapo (frog vaccine) and contains the opioid peptides deltorphin, deltorphin I, deltorphin II and dermorphin. The secretion, known as Kambo or Sapo, has seen increasing popularity in cleansing rituals, where it induces intense vomiting. Claims of medicinal effects have not been supported by medical evidence.

The following March he gave his first recital at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.Lionel Daunais at The Canadian Encyclopedia Daunais was also awarded the Prix d'Europe in 1926 which provided him with the opportunity to pursue studies in Paris with √âmile Marcellin at the Op√©ra-Comique. In 1929 he joined the roster of principal artists at the Opera of Algiers. With that company he sang several leading roles, including Escamillo in Carmen, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Giorgio Germont in La traviata, Lescaut in Manon, and Valentin in Faust. Upon his return to Canada in 1930, Daunais performed with the Bytown Troubadours at the third annual CPR Festivals in Quebec City. At the festival he also portrayed Samuel de Champlain in Healey Willan's The Order of Good Cheer. Later that year he made his debut with the Soci√©t√© canadienne d'op√©rette in Montreal as Cl√©ment Marot in Andr√© Messager's La Basoche. He performed frequently with that company through 1935. In 1932 Daunais founded the Trio lyrique (TL) whose original members also included contralto Anna Malenfant and tenor Ludovic Huot. Jules Jacob replaced Huot in the early 1940s. Daunais recruited pianist and composer Allan McIver to serve as the group's accompanist and arranger. All of the arrangements performed during the TL's performance history were by McIver, including arrangements of many of Daunais's compositions. In 1933 the TL was engaged by CRBC for its network series One Hour with You, on which the group performed for 87 weeks. In the 1934 the TL released the LP album Chansons de Lionel Daunais for Radio Canada International. In 1936 the group performed for the CBS radio network in New York where McIver was also engaged as a staff arranger. The TL continued to perform actively in public concerts and on CBC Radio programs like The Play of the Week, Light Up and Listen. and Serenade for Strings up until the mid-1960s when it disbanded. The group re-united briefly in the autumn of 1971 for CBC broadcasts honoring Daunais and his work. In 1984 the album Le Trio lyrique chante Lionel Daunais was released; containing music from the ensemble's many radio broadcasts.

The Old Foresters Football Club is probably one of the half dozen or so oldest football clubs in the world. It has a continuous and proud history going back before its own formal constitution in 1876 and the founding of The Football Association in 1863. Forest played a considerable part in the development of Association Football and Rugby Football, and \\"The Common\\" in front of the school may well be regarded as a cradle of the game. Forest School is the second oldest continuous member of the F.A. (since December 1863), behind only the Civil Service, and it is the only school to have played in the FA Cup (Donington School entered the first F.A. Cup but never actually played a game).P.C.Adams: \\"From Little Acorns\\", 1976 The club's main on-field achievements are reaching the quarter final of the F.A. Cup in 1882, and the last sixteen a further three times. The Old Foresters have won the prestigious \\"old boys cup\\", The Arthur Dunn Cup three times, the Essex Cup three times and the London Senior Cup twice. Two Old Foresters F.C. players have played for England while at the club: Percy Fairclough and Fred Pelly The club currently fields two regular Saturday sides in the Arthurian League. Home matches are played at Fairlop Oak Playing Fields, Fairlop. Club history =Early football at Forest School= The Common at the front of the school where all early Forest Football was played. Forest School was founded in 1834 and for the first decade or so there was no organised sport, football was only played in informal kick-abouts organised by the pupils. In John Gildersleeve's reign as headmaster (1848-1857) the school participated in cricket and hockey but there was no football at this time. It was on the appointment of Frederick Barlow Guy as headmaster in 1857, that football became quickly established and joined cricket as the dominant sport at the school.Guy Deaton: \\"Schola Sylvestris\\", 1993 Football was played on The Common, at the front of the school. It was a rather uneven playing surface, with the great chestnut trees at the side of the pitch \\"in play\\" and some famous iron railings marking the north end of the pitch. Tradition records some great battles between Charles W. Alcock and F.J. Poole, in which the object was to barge the other player over the iron railings! The earliest reported match against another school was in Forest's first season on 24th February 1858, when Forest beat Chigwell School 5-4 on The Common.Bell's Life In London, 7 March 1858 Another early game was on Saturday 16 November 1861, when Forest School, (playing as \\"Walthamstow\\"), lost to a Westminster School side (playing as \\"Bounding Bricks\\") by three goals to nil.The Sporting Life, 20 November 1861 A return match was played four weeks later, and in 1862 the school played against Old Westminsters (playing as Elizabethan Club).The Sporting Life, 7 December 1862 By 1863, Forest football had a major influence on the development of the game, and it was involved in the formation of the Football Association and also the leading club at the time, The Forest Club. Forest School joined the F.A. for its fifth meeting, on 1 December 1863, when John Bouch and David John Morgan represented the school on a 15-man committee.Adrian Harvey: Football: The First Hundred Years, 2005 It was at this fifth F.A. meeting that the important amendment was made to the rules that running with the ball and hacking would be removed, and Forest, an opponent of such \\"Rugby rules\\", would have been influential in voting for this change.Adrian Harvey: Football: The First Hundred Years, 2005 W.J. Cutbill, a member of the 1863 school team, also served as an early member of the F.A. Committee. H. Tubb, captain of Forest in 1868, has been said to have been an F.A. Committee member, but this is not backed up by F.A. records and is probably a mistaken reading of a reference from the 1888 Forest School Magazine of him being part of the school committee. =The Forest Rules= Although a member of the F.A. from almost the very beginning, the school's own rules, \\"The Forest Rules\\", were still played up until 1867, with 15 players a side. The Wanderers described the Forest Rules as \\"a happy mixture of Rugby, Harrow and Charterhouse rules\\". It was essentially a dribbling game, and \\"shinning, hacking and tripping\\" was not allowed. The Forest Rules, as played in 1866, were as follows: #That the goal posts be six yards apart. #That a base extend for thirty yards in front of goal, and that no person or player may enter this base except while following the ball, and when the ball is kicked out again, all players of the opposite side must go out of the base before again touching the ball. #There shall be no shinning, hacking or tripping. #That on catching the ball from a kick by one of the opposition side, before touching the ground, the person who has caught it may run with it. #If it goes beyond the boundary, it must be thrown in again by the person who touches it first. #If the ball is kicked behind the goal without going through the posts or over, it can be kicked off by the side to whom the goal belongs. #That there be no free kicks allowed. #That the ball when started must be kicked off the ground 30 yds. from the goal. From the 1867-68 season Forest decided to play all its home matches under the rules of the Football Association, although away games could still be played under the local rules of the host club.Forest School Magazine archive, 1867 15 players per side could still be played up until 1869. The first recorded annual fixture between the Old Foresters and the school was in the 1864-65 season,Forest School Magazine archive, 1865 although it is likely to have been played for several years before. Forest School entered the F.A. Cup of 1875‚Äì76, and lost 6‚Äì0 to Oxford University in the first round. This was the only defeat for the school all season however, conceding only two goals in the other fourteen games. The school continued to enter the F.A. Cup until the 1878‚Äì79 season, and thus became the only school ever to compete in the famous competition. =Links with The Forest Club= The Forest Club was founded by Old Harrovian Charles W. Alcock in 1859, primarily for Old Harrovians to continue to play football, but also for other local members.Rob Cavallini: \\"The Wanderers F.C.\\", 2005 The club played on Epping Forest, probably between the Infant Orphan Asylum (now Snaresbrook Crown Court) and Forest Place (now Whipps Cross Road), less than a mile south of Forest School,The Sportsman, 29 October 1868 and several Old Foresters are known to have played for the Forest Club, including five Cutbill brothers, G. H. Edmunds, D.J. Morgan and J. Robertson. The Forest Club became The Wanderers Club in 1864, and went on to win the F.A. Cup five times. =1876 - 1894: The golden era= Old Foresters F.C. team 1885 The Old Foresters Football Club was officially founded in 1876, although as has been mentioned, played regularly against the school and possibly other clubs for many years before. Eleven games were played that first year, with seven being won. From 1877 a second eleven was fielded. Early Old Forester sides were very strong, and the club entered the F.A. Cup for twelve consecutive seasons from 1877-78 until 1888-89. In 1882 the Old Foresters reached the quarter final of the F.A. Cup, losing 0-1 to Great Marlow at Slough in a replay after a 0-0 draw in the first meeting at The Oval. The last sixteen of the F.A. Cup was reached in 1884, 1887 and 1888. The 1887 campaign ended after a 0-3 defeat to Preston North End at Leyton, in front of 5,000 spectators.The Preston Herald, 2 February 1887 Preston North End won the first ever Football League championship two years later. The 1888 campaign included a 4-2 victory over Grimsby Town. The next round was against Middlesbrough. The Old Foresters lost 0-4 at Middlesbrough, but complained that the pitch was unfit for play. A rematch was ordered, but the Foresters refused to travel to Middlesbrough to play on the same pitch, so Middlesbrough were awarded a walkover victory. The last F.A. Cup match for the Old Foresters was a 0-6 defeat to Watford Rovers (later to become Watford F.C.) in the 1888-89 season. The Essex Senior Cup was won in 1885, 1886 and 1887, after which the Old Foresters withdrew from the competition \\"to give somebody else a chance\\". The London Senior Cup was won in 1885 so the Old Foresters withdrew the following season. The next time they entered the competition, in 1894, the cup was won again. During this era, two Old Foresters players were selected to represent England ‚Äî Percy Fairclough in 1878 and Fred Pelly, three times in 1893 and 1894. =The Arthur Dunn Cup= The Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup was founded in 1902 and is the premier \\"old boys\\" cup competition. The Old Foresters were one of the fourteen inaugural clubs to enter, and have competed ever since. The first half of the twentieth century was barren for Old Foresters football, and they reached the semi final of the cup only once in 1908. After the Second World War, the school grew in numbers, and this meant there was a greater pool of talent for the Old Foresters to choose from. The semi final was reached again in 1958 and 1963 and in 1970 the final, only to lose 2-1 to Old Reptonians. In 1974 the Old Foresters won the Arthur Dunn Cup for the first time, beating Old Brentwoods 2-1 after extra time at the Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The league and cup double was achieved that year. Since 1970 the Foresters have consistently been one of the stronger Old Boys sides. The Arthur Dunn Cup was won again in 1997 and 1998 and the Arthurian Premier League was won in 1973, 1974, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2018. =Home Grounds= The Old Foresters played for many years at their home ground at The Park (Shrubbage), within Epping Forest just east of the school. The Park was acquired by Old Foresters in 1914 and given to the school in 1919, and both school and Old Boys shared its use. However, with the school's expansion there was no longer the capacity for the Old Foresters to continue playing at The Park and the first alternative ground was found at Edmonton in 1930. A variety of other grounds were used, until in 1971 the Old Foresters purchased a new ground for their exclusive use at Station Hill, Abridge Road, Theydon Bois. By the 1970s the club ran six weekly sides and a Vets team. The Theydon ground proved too expensive to run, and was sold off in 1988, the club since using the school pitches and Fairlop Oak Playing Fields, Fairlop. The full list of previous home grounds is as follows: *1876 - 1930 The Park, Snaresbrook. *1930 - 1939 Henry Barrass Ground, Lower Edmonton. *1946 - 1947 The Park, Snaresbrook. *1947 - 1971 The Railway Arms, Theydon Bois. *1953 - 1957 Upper Clapton Rugby Club, Thornwood Common (1st team ground). *1957 - 1971 Loughton Cricket Club (1st team ground). *1971 - 1988 Station Hill, Abridge Road, Theydon Bois. *1988 - 2000 Fairlop Oak Playing Fields, Fairlop. *2000 - 2014 The Park, Snaresbrook. *2014 - 2020 Fairlop Oak Playing Fields, Fairlop.

G. De B. Griffith, 'Holroyd, Sir Edward Dundas (1828 - 1916)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 4, MUP, 1972, pp 412-413. Retrieved 1 August 2009 was a judge, active in Australia. Early life Holroyd was born in Surrey, England, the second son of Edward Holroyd, senior commissioner of the London bankruptcy court, and his wife Caroline, n√©e Pugsley. E. D. Holroyd was also grandson of Sir George Sowley Holroyd, an English judge. Holroyd was educated at Winchester College, where he twice won the Queen's medal for Latin and English essays. In 1846 went to Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated B.A. in 1851, M.A. in 1854, and was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in June 1855. Holroyd practised in London and was also a free-lance journalist. Australia Holroyd decided to migrate to Australia, and arrived in Melbourne in 1859. Holroyd made a great reputation as a barrister in equity and mining suits, and in 1872 was offered a seat on the bench of the supreme court. He refused this, became a Queen's Counsel in 1879, and on 19 August 1881 became a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, a position he held until 9 May 1906. Holroyd at first took only equity cases, but later proved to be also an excellent judge in the criminal court. He would not allow himself to be ruffled, and it is related that once when he had sentenced a prisoner named Butler for highway robbery, the man, almost foaming at the mouth, heaped curses on the judge. Holroyd calmly said, \\"Nothing that you can say prisoner can induce me to add one day more to your sentence. I cannot tell you how I despise you.\\" He became the senior judge, and in the absence of Sir John Madden sometimes acted as chief justice. Late life and Legacy Holroyd retired in 1906 and died at his home, Fernacres, in Alma Road, St Kilda, Melbourne, on 5 January 1916. He married in 1862 Anna Maria Hoyles, daughter of Henry Compton, and was survived by two sons and three daughters. He took little part in public discussions, except on the question of federation. He was for some time president of the Imperial Federation League of Victoria, and also of the Athenaeum and Savage Clubs. Holroyd was knighted in 1903. Holroyd was below average height and athletic for much of his life. He was a good boxer in his youth, a good tennis player, and even when over 60 thought little of a 20-mile (32 km) walk. Holroyd had a great sense of humour, was a good after-dinner speaker. He was an eminently fair judge, particularly patient with men conducting their own defence, or a barrister struggling with a poor case. His patient noting of witnesses' answers rather cramped the style of barristers who would have preferred to deliver volleys of questions at the witness. His judgments, in clear English and were seldom appealed against.

The MBROLA software is not a complete speech synthesis system for all those languages; the text must first be transformed into phoneme and prosodic information in MBROLA's format, and separate software (e.g. eSpeakNG) is necessary.  History  MBROLA project started in 1995 at TCTS Lab of the Facult√© polytechnique de Mons (Belgium) as a scientific project to obtain a set of speech synthesizers for as many languages as possible. First release of MBROLA software was in 1996 and was provided as freeware for non-commercial, non-military application. Licenses for created voice databases differ, but are also mostly for non-commercial and non-military use. Due to its free usage only for non-commercial applications, MBROLA was as alternative choice for private/home users for de facto speech synthesis engine eSpeakNG in Linux workstations, but mostly was not used for commercial solutions (e.g. for speaking time clocks, boarding notifications for ports and terminals etc.) After initial development of voice databases updates and support of MBROLA software ceased and gradually closed-source binaries fell behind development of recent hardware and operating systems.Mbrola-64 crashes immediately with a SEGFAULT To deal with this MBROLA development team decided to release MBROLA as open source software, and on October 24, 2018 source code was released on GitHub with GNU Affero General Public License.

Used technology  MBROLA software uses MBROLA (Multi-Band Resynthesis OverLap Add) algorithm for speech generation. Although it is diphone-based, the quality of MBROLA's synthesis is considered to be higher than that of most diphone synthesisers as it preprocesses the diphones imposing constant pitch and harmonic phases that enhances their concatenation while only slightly degrading their segmental quality. MBROLA voice sample of Leonhard Euler quote MBROLA is a time-domain algorithm similar to PSOLA, which implies very low computational load at synthesis time. Unlike PSOLA, however, MBROLA does not require a preliminary marking of pitch periods. This feature has made it possible to develop the MBROLA project around the MBROLA algorithm, through which many speech research labs, companies, or individuals around the world have provided diphone databases for many languages and voices, but there are some notable omissions such as Chinese.

He hoped to solve the horizon problem in a natural way by showing that the early universe underwent an oscillatory, chaotic epoch. Discussion The model is similar to the closed Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker universe, in that spatial slices are positively curved and are topologically three-spheres S^3. However, in the FRW universe, the S^3 can only expand or contract: the only dynamical parameter is overall size of the S^3, parameterized by the scale factor a(t). In the Mixmaster universe, the S^3 can expand or contract, but also distort anisotropically. Its evolution is described by a scale factor a(t) as well as by two shape parameters \\\\beta_\\\\pm(t). Values of the shape parameters describe distortions of the S^3 that preserve its volume and also maintain a constant Ricci curvature scalar. Therefore, as the three parameters a,\\\\beta_\\\\pm assume different values, homogeneity but not isotropy is preserved. The model has a rich dynamical structure. Misner showed that the shape parameters \\\\beta_\\\\pm(t) act like the coordinates of a point mass moving in a triangular potential with steeply rising walls with friction. By studying the motion of this point, Misner showed that the physical universe would expand in some directions and contract in others, with the directions of expansion and contraction changing repeatedly. Because the potential is roughly triangular, Misner suggested that the evolution is chaotic. Metric The metric studied by Misner (very slightly modified from his notation) is given by, :\\\\text{d}s^2 = -\\\\text{d}t^2 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^3 {L_k^2(t)} \\\\sigma_k \\\\otimes \\\\sigma_k where : L_k = R(t)e^{\\\\beta_k} and the \\\\sigma_k, considered as differential forms, are defined by :\\\\sigma_1 = \\\\sin \\\\psi \\\\text{d}\\\\theta - \\\\cos\\\\psi \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\text{d}\\\\phi :\\\\sigma_2 = \\\\cos \\\\psi \\\\text{d}\\\\theta + \\\\sin\\\\psi \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\text{d}\\\\phi :\\\\sigma_3 = -\\\\text{d}\\\\psi - \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\text{d}\\\\phi In terms of the coordinates (\\\\theta,\\\\psi,\\\\phi). These satisfy : \\\\text{d}\\\\sigma_i = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\epsilon_{ijk} \\\\sigma_j \\\\wedge \\\\sigma_k where \\\\text{d} is the exterior derivative and \\\\wedge the wedge product of differential forms. The 1-forms \\\\sigma_i form a left-invariant co-frame on the Lie group SU(2), which is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere S^3, so the spatial metric in Misner's model can concisely be described as just a left-invariant metric on the 3-sphere; indeed, up to the adjoint action of SU(2), this is actually the _general_ left-invariant metric. As the metric evolves via Einstein's equation, the geometry of this S^3 typically distorts anisotropically. Misner defines parameters \\\\Omega(t) and R(t) which measure the volume of spatial slices, as well as \\"shape parameters\\" \\\\beta_k, by :R(t) = e^{-\\\\Omega(t)} = (L_1(t) L_2(t) L_3(t))^{1/3}, \\\\quad \\\\sum_{k=1}^3 \\\\beta_k(t) = 0. Since there is one condition on the three \\\\beta_k, there should only be two free functions, which Misner chooses to be \\\\beta_\\\\pm, defined as :\\\\beta_+ = \\\\beta_1 + \\\\beta_2 = -\\\\beta_3, \\\\quad \\\\beta_- = \\\\frac{\\\\beta_1 - \\\\beta_2}{\\\\sqrt{3}} The evolution of the universe is then described by finding \\\\beta_\\\\pm as functions of \\\\Omega. Applications to cosmology Misner hoped that the chaos would churn up and smooth out the early universe. Also, during periods in which one direction was static (e.g., going from expansion to contraction) formally the Hubble horizon H^{-1} in that direction is infinite, which he suggested meant that the horizon problem could be solved. Since the directions of expansion and contraction varied, presumably given enough time the horizon problem would get solved in every direction. While an interesting example of gravitational chaos, it is widely recognized that the cosmological problems the Mixmaster universe attempts to solve are more elegantly tackled by cosmic inflation. The metric Misner studied is also known as the Bianchi type IX metric.

Like the rack rate at a hotel, this is generally the maximum price that one may pay. Most advertising buyers will pay significantly less than this,Marketing Terms: Rate card receiving discounts due to volume, a desire to sell unused space, or other factors. See also * Advertising management * Yield management * Price discrimination There are many websites and companies which sell rate cards or advertise them. This is because they have already done the research to see which rate works the best in the media and on television. Advertisers and companies looking to make a profit turn to the rate card to see how much they will need to be spending to get their message across to consumers. A rate card is a document provided by a newspaper or other print publication featuring the organization's rate for advertising. It may also detail any deadlines, demographics, policies, additional fees and artwork requirements. The smaller the publication, the less information that may be available in the rate card. Some larger newspapers may have a rate card for a particular kind of advertisement. They may have their rates broken down by classified ads, retail advertising and even national ad rates. Rate cards help the retailer understand what types of ad sizes, discounts and other advertising the publication has to offer. When choosing a newspaper or print media, you can use rate cards to compare ad rates based on circulation before you buy advertising space. Before placing an ad, be sure you understand the terms and conditions of advertising with the publication. In many cases where there may be a conflict between the insertion order and the rate card, the rate card will be the deciding factor. This does not mean the prices on the rate card are fixed. Most retailers will find the paper's sales rep will offer special rates for first time advertisers or other discounts. If you're interested in advertising within a particular publication, check their website or call the office and ask for a copy of their current rate card. Many newspapers and magazines have their rate cards available online in a PDF format.
