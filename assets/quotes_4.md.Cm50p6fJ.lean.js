In the case of a diatomic molecule (with one parameter, namely the bond length), this means that the eigenvalues cannot cross at all. In the case of a triatomic molecule, this means that the eigenvalues can coincide only at a single point (see conical intersection). This is particularly important in quantum chemistry. In the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation, the electronic molecular Hamiltonian is diagonalized on a set of distinct molecular geometries (the obtained eigenvalues are the values of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces). The geometries for which the potential energy surfaces are avoiding to cross are the locus where the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation fails. In two-state systems = Emergence = Study of a two-level system is of vital importance in quantum mechanics because it embodies simplification of many of physically realizable systems. The effect of perturbation on a two-state system Hamiltonian is manifested through avoided crossings in the plot of individual energy vs energy difference curve of the eigenstates.Cohen-Tannaoudji,Claude et al.(1992),Quantum Mechanics( Vol. 1), p.409 The two-state Hamiltonian can be written as :H= \\\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&E;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! The eigenvalues of which are \\\\textstyle E_{1} and \\\\textstyle E_{2} and the eigenvectors, \\\\textstyle \\\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\textstyle \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix} . These two eigenvectors designate the two states of the system. If the system is prepared in either of the states it would remain in that state. If \\\\textstyle E_{1} happens to be equal to E_{2} there will be a twofold degeneracy in the Hamiltonian. In that case any superposition of the degenerate eigenstates is evidently another eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Hence the system prepared in any state will remain in that forever. ). In the absence of external perturbation the levels would have crossed if the original energy states were degenerate, i.e. \\\\textstyle \\\\Delta E = 0 However, when subjected to an external perturbation, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian change. For the sake of simplicity we consider a perturbation with only off diagonal elements. Since the overall Hamiltonian must be Hermitian we may simply write the new Hamiltonian : H^{'} = H + P= \\\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&E;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} + \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&W;\\\\\\\\\\\\W^{*}&0\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}&W;\\\\\\\\\\\\W^{*}&E;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Where P is the perturbation with zero diagonal terms. The fact that P is Hermitian fixes its off-diagonal components. The modified eigenstates can be found by diagonalising the modified Hamiltonian. It turns out that the new eigenvalues are, : E_{+}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}+E_{2})+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{(E_{1}-E_{2})^{2}+4W^{2}} : E_{-}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}+E_{2})-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{(E_{1}-E_{2})^{2}+4W^{2}} If a graph is plotted varying \\\\textstyle (E_{1}-E_{2}) along the horizontal axis and \\\\textstyle E_{+} or \\\\textstyle E_{-} along the vertical, we find two branches of a hyperbola (as shown in the figure). The curve asymptotically approaches the original unperturbed energy levels. Analyzing the curves it becomes evident that even if the original states were degenerate (i.e. \\\\textstyle E_{1}=E_{2} ) the new energy states are no longer equal. However, if \\\\textstyle W is set to zero we may find at \\\\textstyle (E_{1}-E_{2})=0 , \\\\textstyle E_{+}=E_{-} and the levels cross. Thus with the effect of the perturbation these level crossings are avoided. = Quantum resonance = The immediate impact of avoided level crossing in a degenerate two state system is the emergence of a lowered energy eigenstate. The effective lowering of energy always correspond to increasing stability.(see: Energy minimization) Bond resonance in organic molecules exemplifies the occurrence of such avoided crossings. To describe these cases we may note that the non-diagonal elements in an erstwhile diagonalised Hamiltonian not only modify the energy eigenvalues but also superpose the old eigenstates into the new ones.Cohen- Tannaoudji,Claude et al.(1992),Quantum Mechanics( Vol. 1), p.410 These effects are more prominent if the original Hamiltonian had degeneracy. This superposition of eigenstates to attain more stability is precisely the phenomena of chemical bond resonance. Our earlier treatment started by denoting the eigenvectors \\\\textstyle \\\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\textstyle \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix} as the matrix representation of eigenstates \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{1} \\\\rangle and \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{2} \\\\rangle of a two-state system. Using bra‚Äìket notation the matrix elements of H^{'} are actually the terms : H^{'}_{ij}=\\\\langle \\\\psi_{i}H^{'}\\\\psi_{j} \\\\rangle with i,j \\\\in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {1,2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where H^{'}_{11}=H^{'}_{22}=E due to the degeneracy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the off-diagonal perturbations are H^{'}_{12}=W and H^{'}_{21}=W^{*}. The new eigenstates \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{+} \\\\rangle and \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{-} \\\\rangle can be found by solving the eigenvalue equations H^{'}\\\\psi_{+}\\\\rangle=E_{+}\\\\psi_{+}\\\\rangle and H^{'}\\\\psi_{-}\\\\rangle=E_{-}\\\\psi_{-}\\\\rangle . From simple calculations it can be shown that : \\\\psi_{+}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\begin{pmatrix}e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} (e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\psi_{1}\\\\rangle +\\\\psi_{2}\\\\rangle) and : \\\\psi_{-}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\begin{pmatrix}-e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} (-e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\psi_{1}\\\\rangle +\\\\psi_{2}\\\\rangle) where e^{i\\\\phi}=W/W It is evident that both of the new eigenstates are superposition of the original degenerate eigenstates and one of the eigenvalues (here E_{-} ) is less than the original unperturbed eigenenergy. So the corresponding stable system will naturally mix up the former unperturbed eigenstates to minimize its energy. In the example of Benzene the experimental evidences of probable bond structures give rise to two different eigenstates, \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{1} \\\\rangle and \\\\textstyle \\\\psi_{2} \\\\rangle . The symmetry of these two structures mandates that \\\\langle \\\\psi_{1}H\\\\psi_{1}\\\\rangle=\\\\langle \\\\psi_{2}H\\\\psi_{2}\\\\rangle=E . 500px However it turns out that the two-state Hamiltonian H of Benzene is not diagonal. The off-diagonal elements result into lowering of energy and the Benzene molecule stabilizes in a structure which is a superposition of these symmetric ones with energy E_{-}.Cohen-Tannaoudji,Claude et al.(1992),Quantum Mechanics( Vol. 1), p.411 For any general two-state system avoided level crossing repels the eigenstates \\\\psi_{+}\\\\rangle and \\\\psi_{-}\\\\rangle such that it requires more energy for the system to achieve the higher energy configuration. General avoided crossing theorem The above illustration of avoided crossing however is a very specific case. From a generalised view point the phenomenon of avoided crossing is actually controlled by the parameters behind the perturbation. For the most general perturbation \\\\textstyle P=\\\\begin{pmatrix}W_{1}&W;\\\\\\\\\\\\W&W;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} affecting a two- dimensional subspace of the Hamiltonian H , we may write the effective Hamiltonian matrix in that subspace as : \\\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&E;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} + \\\\begin{pmatrix}W_{1}&W;\\\\\\\\\\\\W&W;_{2}\\\\end{pmatrix} =\\\\begin{pmatrix}E_{1}+W_{1}&W;\\\\\\\\\\\\W&E;_{2}+W_{2}.\\\\end{pmatrix}. Here the elements of the state vectors were chosen to be real so that all the matrix elements become real.Landau,Lifshitz(1981),Quantum Mechanics, p.304 Now the eigenvalues of the system for this subspace are given by : E_{\\\\pm}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}+E_{2}+W_{1}+W_{2}) \\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{(E_{1}-E_{2}+W_{1}-W_{2})^{2}+4W^{2}} The terms under the square root are squared real numbers. So for these two levels to cross we simultaneously require : (E_{1}-E_{2}+W_{1}-W_{2})=0 : W=0. Now if the perturbation P has k parameters { \\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},\\\\alpha_{3}.....\\\\alpha_{k} } we may in general vary these numbers to satisfy these two equations. : (E_{1}-E_{2}+W_{1}-W_{2})=F_{1}(\\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},\\\\alpha_{3}.....\\\\alpha_{k})=0 : W=F_{2}(\\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},\\\\alpha_{3}.....\\\\alpha_{k})=0. If we choose the values of \\\\alpha_{1} to \\\\alpha_{k-1} then both of the equations above have one single free parameter. In general it is not possible to find one \\\\alpha_{k} such that both of the equations are satisfied. However, if we allow another parameter to be free, both of these two equations will now be controlled by the same two parameters : F_{1}(\\\\alpha_{k-1},\\\\alpha_{k})_{\\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},...,\\\\alpha_{k-2} \\\\, fixed}=0 : F_{2}(\\\\alpha_{k-1},\\\\alpha_{k})_{\\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},...,\\\\alpha_{k-2} \\\\, fixed}=0. And generally there will be two such values of them for which the equations will be simultaneously satisfied. So with k distinct parameters k-2 parameters can always be chosen arbitrarily and still we can find two such \\\\alpha_{k} s such that there would be crossing of energy eigenvalues. In other words, the values of E_{+} and E_{-} would be the same for k-2 freely varying co-ordinates (while the rest of the two co-ordinates are fixed from the condition equations). Geometrically the eigenvalue equations describe a surface in k dimensional space. : E_{\\\\pm}=E_{\\\\pm}(\\\\alpha_{1},\\\\alpha_{2},\\\\alpha_{3}.....\\\\alpha_{k}). Since their intersection is parametrized by k-2 coordinates, we may formally state that for k continuous real parameters controlling the perturbed Hamiltonian, the levels (or surfaces) can only cross at a manifold of dimension k-2 .Landau,Lifshitz (1981), Quantum Mechanics, p.305 However the symmetry of the Hamiltonian has a role to play in the dimensionality. If the original Hamiltonian has asymmetric states, \\\\langle \\\\psi_{1}P\\\\psi_{2}\\\\rangle eq \\\\langle \\\\psi_{2}P\\\\psi_{1}\\\\rangle , the off-diagonal terms vanish automatically to ensure hermiticity. This allows us to get rid of the equation W=0 . Now from similar arguments as posed above, it is straightforward that for an asymmetrical Hamiltonian, the intersection of energy surfaces takes place in a manifold of dimension k-1 .Landau,Lifshitz(1981),Quantum Mechanics, p.305 In polyatomic molecules In an N-atomic polyatomic molecule there are 3N-6 vibrational coordinates (3N-5 for a linear molecule) that enter into the electronic Hamiltonian as parameters. For a diatomic molecule there is only one such coordinate, the bond length r. Thus, due to the avoided crossing theorem, in a diatomic molecule we cannot have level crossings between electronic states of the same symmetry. However, for a polyatomic molecule there is more than one geometry parameter in the electronic Hamiltonian and level crossings between electronic states of the same symmetry are not avoided See also * Geometric phase * Christopher Longuet-Higgins * Conical intersection * Vibronic coupling * Adiabatic theorem * Bond hardening * Bond softening * Landau‚ÄìZener formula * Level repulsion References Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Quantum chemistry ","title":"Avoided crossing"},{"id":"2174015","text":"Puerto Escondido International Airport () is an airport located at Puerto Escondido in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.

Bouvier was a professor at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Biography Following graduation at the normal school in Lons-le- Saunier, he taught classes in Clairvaux, Versailles, Saint-Cloud and Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne. From 1882 to 1887, he served as a \\"boursier\\" at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, where he studied with Alphonse Milne- Edwards (1835‚Äì1900) and Edmond Perrier (1844‚Äì1921). Together with Milne- Edwards, he worked on some of the crustaceans from the Travailleur and Talisman expeditions (1880‚Äì1883). In 1887, he earned his doctorate in natural sciences with a dissertation involving prosobranch gastropods, Syst√®me nerveux, morphologie g√©n√©rale et classification des Gast√©ropodes prosobranches. In 1889 he became an associate professor at the Ecole sup√©rieure de pharmacie de Paris, and in 1895, he attained a professorship of natural history (chair of \\"articulated animals\\"; starting in 1917 it was referred to as the chair of entomology) at the Mus√©um. Bouvier maintained the chair of entomology until 1931, when he was succeeded by Ren√© Jeannel (1879‚Äì1965). His earlier studies dealt with evolution of various species, in particular crustaceans and mollusks. Later, he specialized in behavioral research of social insects, conducting extensive studies on the sense of smell in ants. In 1894 he was elected president of the Soci√©t√© zoologique de France, and in 1897, is chosen president of the Soci√©t√© entomologique de France. In 1905 he participated in a scientific survey of deep-sea fauna in the Sargasso Sea. For a period time (1906‚Äì1910), he taught classes in entomology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. His famous work The Psychic Life of Insects (1918) was well received.

It is also the last game released under the WWF name as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May of that year. A sequel was released in 2003. During development, the game was originally called WWF Raw is War, but the title was changed after the WWF shortened the TV show's title in October 2001 due to September 11 attacks and end of Monday Night Wars. In Japan, a limited edition was released with a shirt and a figure of the Undertaker or Hollywood Hulk Hogan (who does not appear in the game).  Game play  The game offers the players a wrestling experience with various matches like singles match, tag team match, triple threat, fatal four-way, battle royal and handicap matches. The players can also play various tournaments such as King of the Ring and several title tournaments. They can create their own character as well as their attire, move set and entrance. The game has a weak/strong grapple system and there are two types of grapples: one which is done with normal opponents and other with groggy opponents. The normal grapples do little harm when compared to grapples done when the opponent is stunned. There is a voltage meter which shows the momentum of the wrestlers. Special move, high flying attacks and taunting boost the momentum while repeated attacks cost loss in momentum. Finishers can only be applied when the opponent is stunned and the voltage meter is flashing. Excessive use of finisher also cause loss in momentum.

Mounting a cryptographic brute force attack requires a large number of similar computations: typically trying one key, checking if the resulting decryption gives a meaningful answer, and then trying the next key if it does not. Computers can perform these calculations at a rate of millions per second, and thousands of computers can be harnessed together in a distributed computing network. But the number of computations required on average grows exponentially with the size of the key, and for many problems standard computers are not fast enough. On the other hand, many cryptographic algorithms lend themselves to fast implementation in hardware, i.e. networks of logic circuits, also known as gates. Integrated circuits (ICs) are constructed of these gates and often can execute cryptographic algorithms hundreds of times faster than a general purpose computer. Each IC can contain large numbers of gates (hundreds of millions in 2005). Thus the same decryption circuit, or cell, can be replicated thousands of times on one IC. The communications requirements for these ICs are very simple. Each must be initially loaded with a starting point in the key space and, in some situations, with a comparison test value (see known plaintext attack). Output consists of a signal that the IC has found an answer and the successful key. Since ICs lend themselves to mass production, thousands or even millions of ICs can be applied to a single problem. The ICs themselves can be mounted in printed circuit boards. A standard board design can be used for different problems since the communication requirements for the chips are the same. Wafer-scale integration is another possibility. The primary limitations on this method are the cost of chip design, IC fabrication, floor space, electric power and thermal dissipation. An alternative approach is to use FPGAs (field- programmable gate arrays); these are slower and more expensive per gate, but can be reprogrammed for different problems. COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel COde Breaker) is one such machine, consisting of 120 FPGAs of type Xilinx Spartan3-1000 which run in parallel.  History  The earliest custom hardware attack may have been the Bombe used to recover Enigma machine keys in World War II. In 1998, a custom hardware attack was mounted against the Data Encryption Standard cipher by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Their \\"Deep Crack\\" machine cost U.S. $250,000 to build and decrypted the DES Challenge II-2 test message after 56 hours of work. The only other confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine (Cost-Optimized PArallel COde Breaker) built in 2006. Unlike Deep Crack, COPACOBANA consist of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. COPACOBANA costs about $10,000 to build and will recover a DES key in under 6.4 days on average. The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an impressive example for the continuous improvement of digital hardware. Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH, a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to the current record of less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's.Break DES in less than a single day [Press release of firm, demonstrated at a 2009 workshop] It is generally believed that large government code breaking organizations, such as the U.S. National Security Agency, make extensive use of custom hardware attacks, but no examples have been declassified .

Career Recorded originally as a \\"low budget\\" project at Bob Blank's Blank Tape StudiosDiscogs ‚Äì Blank Tape Studios profile and discography in New York City (the tracking session was completed in four hours), the album Keep on Jumpin contained only four cuts: \\"Keep on Jumpin',\\" \\"Summer Love,\\" \\"In the Bush\\" and \\"Summer Love Theme.\\" Adams, known for his arranging, wrote the horn section parts as the studio musicians sat waiting. Those musicians included Skip McDonald and Doug Wimbish who were among the musicians later responsible for much of the backing work at Sugar Hill Records before teaming up to become known as Tackhead in the 1980s, collaborating with Adrian Sherwood on numerous works on his label ON-U Sound in England. Due to the overtly sexual lyrics of \\"In the Bush\\" many radio stations banned it when it was released during 1978. Because of limited airplay it only scored No. 58 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 21 on the Black Singles Chart, although it did top the Hot Dance Club Play chart along with the second single \\"Keep on Jumpin'\\". It also reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1978.Their second big hit, \\"Keep on Jumpin'\\" was another club success peaking at No. 1 on the Disco and Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song crossed over to the urban market and peaked at No. 81 on the Black Singles chart. Musique's debut album peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard 200 chart. The vocalists on the first LP Keep on Jumpin' were a pre-solo career Jocelyn Brown, Angela Howell, Gina Tharps and Christine Wiltshire. On the second LP Musique II, released in 1979, Mary Seymour, Denise Edwards and Gina Taylor took the lead vocals. Both albums were released on the Prelude Records label. \\"Love Massage\\" became another successful club hit, but failed to crossover to either the R&B; or pop markets.

Substation automation refers to using data from Intelligent electronic devices (IED), control and automation capabilities within the substation, and control commands from remote users to control power-system devices. Since full substation automation relies on substation integration, the terms are often used interchangeably. Power-system automation includes processes associated with generation and delivery of power. Monitoring and control of power delivery systems in the substation and on the pole reduce the occurrence of outages and shorten the duration of outages that do occur. The IEDs, communications protocols, and communications methods, work together as a system to perform power-system automation. The term ‚Äúpower system‚Äù describes the collection of devices that make up the physical systems that generate, transmit, and distribute power. The term ‚Äúinstrumentation and control (I&C;) system‚Äù refers to the collection of devices that monitor, control, and protect the power system. Many power- system automation are monitored by SCADA. Automation tasks Power-system automation is composed of several tasks. ;Data acquisition: Data acquisition refers to acquiring, or collecting, data. This data is collected in the form of measured analog current or voltage values or the open or closed status of contact points. Acquired data can be used locally within the device collecting it, sent to another device in a substation, or sent from the substation to one or several databases for use by operators, engineers, planners, and administration. ;Supervision: Computer processes and personnel supervise, or monitor, the conditions and status of the power system using this acquired data. Operators and engineers monitor the information remotely on computer displays and graphical wall displays or locally, at the device, on front-panel displays and laptop computers. ;Control: Control refers to sending command messages to a device to operate the I&C; and power-system devices. Traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems rely on operators to supervise the system and initiate commands from an operator console on the master computer. Field personnel can also control devices using front-panel push buttons or a laptop computer. In addition, another task is power-system integration, which is the act of communicating data to, from, or among IEDs in the I&C; system and remote users. Substation integration refers to combining data from the IED's local to a substation so that there is a single point of contact in the substation for all of the I&C; data. Power-system automation processes rely on data acquisition; power-system supervision and power-system control all working together in a coordinated automatic fashion. The commands are generated automatically and then transmitted in the same fashion as operator initiated commands. Hardware structure of the power-system automation =Data acquisition system= The instrument transformers with protective relays are used to sense the power-system voltage and current. They are physically connected to power-system apparatus and convert the actual power-system signals. The transducers convert the analog output of an instrument transformer from one magnitude to another or from one value type to another, such as from an ac current to dc voltage. Also the input data is taken from the auxiliary contacts of switch gears and power-system control equipment. =Main processing instrumentation and control (I&C;) device= The I&C; devices built using microprocessors are commonly referred to as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Microprocessors are single chip computers that allow the devices into which they are built to process data, accept commands, and communicate information like a computer. Automatic processes can be run in the IEDs. Some IEDs used in power-system automation are: ;Remote Terminal Unit (RTU): A remote terminal unit is an IED that can be installed in a remote location, and acts as a termination point for field contacts. A dedicated pair of copper conductors is used to sense every contact and transducer value. These conductors originate at the power-system device, are installed in trenches or overhead cable trays, and are then terminated on panels within the RTU. The RTU can transfer collected data to other devices and receive data and control commands from other devices. User programmable RTUs are referred to as ‚Äúsmart RTUs.‚Äù ;Meter: A meter is an IED that is used to create accurate measurements of power-system current, voltage, and power values. Metering values such as demand and peak are saved within the meter to create historical information about the activity of the power system. ;Digital fault recorder: A digital fault recorder (DFR) is an IED that records information about power-system disturbances. It is capable of storing data in a digital format when triggered by conditions detected on the power system. Harmonics, frequency, and voltage are examples of data captured by DFRs. ;Programmable logic controller (PLC): A Programmable Logic Controller can be programmed to perform logical control. As with the RTU, a dedicated pair of copper conductors for each contact and transducer value is terminated on panels within the PLC.It is like a work-horse which work upon the command given by their master. ;Protective relay: A protective relay is an IED designed to sense power-system disturbances and automatically perform control actions on the I&C; system and the power system to protect personnel and equipment. The relay has local termination so that the copper conductors for each contact do not have to be routed to a central termination panel associated with RTU. = Controlling (output) devices= ;Load tap changer (LTC): Load tap changers are devices used to change the tap position on transformers. These devices work automatically or can be controlled via another local IED or from a remote operator or process. ;Recloser controller: Recloser controllers remotely control the operation of automated reclosers and switches. These devices monitor and store power-system conditions and determine when to perform control actions. They also accept commands from a remote operator or process. = Communications devices = ;Communications processor: A communications processor is a substation controller that incorporates the functions of many other I&C; devices into one IED. It has many communications ports to support multiple simultaneous communications links. The communications processor performs data acquisition and control of the other substation IEDs and also concentrates the data it acquires for transmission to one or many masters inside and outside the substation. Applications =Overcurrent protection= All lines and all electrical equipment must be protected against prolonged overcurrent. If the cause of the overcurrent is nearby then automatically that current is interrupted immediately. But if the cause of the overcurrent is outside the local area then a backup provision automatically disconnects all affected circuits after a suitable time delay. Note that disconnection can, unfortunately, have a cascade effect, leading to overcurrent in other circuits that then also must therefore disconnect automatically. Also note that generators that suddenly have lost their load because of such a protection operation will have to shut down automatically immediately, and it may take many hours to restore a proper balance between demand and supply in the system, partly because there must be proper synchronization before any two parts of the system can be reconnected. Reclosing operations of circuit breakers usually are attempted automatically, and often are successful during thunderstorms, for example. =Supervisory control and data acquisition= A supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) transmits and receives logic or data from events of controls, metering, measuring, safety and monitoring of process devices such as Electrical equipment, Instrumentation devices, telecommunication on industrial applications. Power system elements ranging from pole-mounted switches to entire power plants can be controlled remotely over long distance communication links. Remote switching, telemetering of grids (showing voltage, current, power, direction, consumption in kWh, etc.), even automatic synchronization is used in some power systems. Optical fibers Power utility companies protect high voltage lines by monitoring them constantly. This supervision requires the transmission of information between the power substations in order to ensure correct operation while controlling every alarm and failure. Legacy telecom networks were interconnected with metallic wires, but the substation environment is characterized by a high level of electromagnetic fields that may disturb copper wires. Authorities use a tele- protection scheme to enable substations to communicate with one another to selectively isolate faults on high voltage lines, transformers, reactors and other important elements of the electrical plants. This functionality requires the continuous exchange of critical data in order to assure correct operation. In order to warranty the operation the telecom network should always be in perfect conditions in terms of availability, performance, quality and delays. Initially these networks were made of metallic conductive media, however the vulnerability of the 56‚Äì64 kbit/s channels to electromagnetic interference, signal ground loops, and ground potential rise made them too unreliable for the power industry. Strong electromagnetic fields caused by the high voltages and currents in power lines occur regularly in electric substations. Moreover, during fault conditions electromagnetic perturbations may rise significantly and disturb those communications channels based on copper wires. The reliability of the communications link interconnecting the protection relays is critical and therefore must be resistant to effects encountered in high voltage areas, such as high frequency induction and ground potential rise. Consequently, the power industry moved to optical fibers to interconnect the different items installed in substations. Fiber optics need not be grounded and are immune to the interferences caused by electrical noise, eliminating many of the errors commonly seen with electrical connections. The use of fully optical links from power relays to multiplexers as described by IEEE C37.94 became standard. A more sophisticated architecture for the protection scheme emphasizes the notion of fault tolerant networks. Instead of using a direct relay connection and dedicated fibers, redundant connections make the protection process more reliable by increasing the availability of critical data interchanges. C37.94 C37.94 protection architecture IEEE C37.94 , full title IEEE Standard for N Times 64 Kilobit Per Second Optical Fiber Interfaces Between Teleprotection and Multiplexer Equipment, is an IEEE standard, published in 2002, that defines the rules to interconnect tele- protection and multiplexer devices of power utility companies. The standard defines a data frame format for optical interconnection, and references standards for the physical connector for multi-mode optical fiber. Furthermore, it defines behavior of connected equipment on failure of the link, and the timing and optical signal characteristics. Teleprotection systems must isolate faults very quickly to prevent damage to the network and power outages. The IEEE committee defined C37.94 as a programmable n x 64 kbit/s (n=1...12) multimode optical fiber interface to provide transparent communications between teleprotection relays and multiplexers for distances of up to 2 km. To reach longer distances, the power industry later adopted a single mode optical fiber interface as well. The standard defines the protection and communications equipment inside a substation using optical fibers, the method for clock recovery, the jitter tolerances allowed in the signals, the physical connection method, and the actions the protection equipment must follow when any kind of network anomalies and faults occur. C37.94 was already implemented by many protection relay manufacturers such as ABB, SEL, RFL, and RAD; and tester manufacturers such as ALBEDO and VEEX. Teleprotection equipment once offered a choice of transmission interfaces, such as the IEEE C37.94 compliant optical fiber interface for transmission over fiber pairs, and G.703, 64kbit/s co-directional and E1 interfaces.

She is best known for her Obie Award-winning play, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf. She also penned novels including Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo (1982), Liliane (1994), and Betsey Brown (1985), about an African-American girl runaway from home. Among Shange's honors and awards were fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund, and a Pushcart Prize. In April 2016, Barnard College announced it had acquired Shange's archive. Shange lived in Brooklyn, New York.Lee, Felicia R.

Early life Shange was born Paulette Linda Williams in Trenton, New Jersey, to an upper-middle-class family. Her father, Paul T. Williams, was a surgeon, and her mother, Eloise Williams, was an educator and a psychiatric social worker. When she was aged eight, Shange's family moved to the racially segregated city of St. Louis. As a result of the Brown v. Board of Education court decision, Shange was bused to a white school where she endured racism and racist attacks. Shange's family had a strong interest in the arts and encouraged her artistic education. Among the guests at their home were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Chuck Berry, and W. E. B. Du Bois. From an early age, Shange took an interest in poetry. While growing up with her family in Trenton, Shange attended poetry readings with her younger sister Wanda (now known as the playwright Ifa Bayeza).\\"Author Ifa Bayeza Comes 'Home' at Library Reading and Book Signing\\", Town Topics, March 27, 2013. These poetry readings fostered an early interest for Shange in the South in particular, and the loss it represented to young Black children who migrated to the North with their parents. In 1956, Shange's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where Shange was sent several miles away from home to a non-segregated school that allowed her to receive \\"gifted\\" education. While attending this non-segregated school, Shange faced overt racism and harassment. These experiences would later go on to heavily influence her work.

During her time at Barnard, Shange met fellow Barnard student and would- be poet Thulani Davis. The two poets would later go on to collaborate on various works. Shange graduated cum laude in American Studies, then earned a master's degree in the same field from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. However, her college years were not all pleasant. She married during her first year in college, but the marriage did not last long. Depressed over her separation and with a strong sense of bitterness and alienation, she attempted suicide.Holloway, Lynette, \\"Interview With An Author: Ntozake Shange Returns to the Spotlight With Epic Novel and Film Adaptation of Groundbreaking 'For Colored Girls'\\", BV on Books, October 15, 2010. In 1971, having come to terms with her depression and alienation, Shange changed her name. In Zulu, Ntozake means \\"she who comes with her own things\\" and Shange means \\"who walks like a lion\\".McLarin, Kimberly J. (November 24, 1994), \\"At Home with Ntozake Shange\\", The New York Times. Career In 1975, Shange moved back to New York City, after earning her master's degree in American Studies in 1973 from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. She is acknowledged as having been a founding poet of the Nuyorican Poets Caf√©. In that year her first and most well-known play was produced ‚Äî for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf. First produced Off-Broadway, the play soon moved on to Broadway at the Booth Theater and won several awards, including the Obie Award, Outer Critics Circle Award, and the AUDELCO Award. This play, her most famous work, was a 20-part choreopoem ‚Äî a term Shange coined to describe her groundbreaking dramatic form, combining of poetry, dance, music, and songCarr, Jane (October 28, 2018), \\"What 'For Colored Girls' meant to us\\", CNN. ‚Äî that chronicled the lives of women of color in the United States. The poem was eventually made into the stage play, was then published in book form in 1977. In 2010, the choreopoem was adapted into a film (For Colored Girls, directed by Tyler Perry). Shange subsequently wrote other successful plays, including Spell No. 7, a 1979 choreopoem that explores the Black experience, and an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children (1980), which won an Obie Award. In 1978, Shange became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Shange taught in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston from 1984 to 1986. While there she wrote the ekphrastic poetry collection Ridin the Moon in Texas: Word Paintings and served as thesis advisor for poet and playwright Annie Finch. In 2003, Shange wrote and oversaw the production of Lavender Lizards and Lilac Landmines: Layla's Dream while serving as a visiting artist at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Shange's individual poems, essays, and short stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, including The Black Scholar, Yardbird, Ms., Essence Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, VIBE, Daughters of Africa, and Third-World Women. Relationship to the Black Arts Movement The Black Arts Movement‚Äîalso known as BAM‚Äîhas been described as the \\"aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept.\\"Ya Salaam, Kaluma [sic], \\"Historical Overviews of the Black Arts Movement\\". Modern American Poetry. The University of Illinois, 1995. The Black Arts Movement is a subset of the Black Power Movement. Larry Neal described the Black Arts Movement as a \\"radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic.\\" Key concepts of BAM were focused on a \\"separate symbolism, mythology, critique, and iconology\\" as well as the African American's desire for \\"self-determination and nationhood.\\" BAM consisted of actors, actresses, choreographers, musicians, novelists, poets, photographers, and artists. Though male artists such as Amiri Baraka heavily dominated the Black Arts Movement, some notable women writers of the movement were Gwendolyn Brooks, Nikki Giovanni, Rosa Guy, Lorraine Hansberry, Lucille Clifton, and Sonia Sanchez, among others. Although Shange is described as a \\"post-Black artist,\\" her work was decidedly feminist whereas BAM has been criticized as misogynistic and \\"sexism had been widely and hotly debated within movement publications and organizations.\\" Corresponding with the idea that art from BAM was a \\"radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic,\\" Shange herself described her atypical writing style. In regards to her plays, she stated: \\"A play has a form that has to be finished. A performance piece has an organic form, but it can even flow. And there doesn't have to be some ultimate climax in it. And there does not have to be a denouement.\\"Anderlini, Serena. \\"Drama or Performance Art? An Interview with Ntozake Shange\\", Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism (1991): 85‚Äì98. University of Kansas. Though Shange's work did have a \\"radical reordering of western cultural aesthetics\\" with its spelling, structure, and style, Baraka‚Äîone of the leading male figures of the movement denied her as a post- Black artist. In regards to Shange as a part of the black aesthetic and as a post-Black artist, he claimed \\"that several women writers, among them Michelle Wallace [sic] and Ntozake Shange, like [Ishmael] Reed, had their own 'Hollywood' aesthetic, one of 'capitulation' and 'garbage.'\\" In regards to a black aesthetic, Shange described different styles of writing for different parts of the country. She stated: \\"There's not a California style, but there are certain feelings and a certain freeness that set those writers off from those in the Chicago-St. Louis-Detroit tripod group...so that the chauvinism that you might find that's exclusionary, in that triangle, you don't find too much in California.\\" Shange set her writing apart from the Black aesthetic of the Black arts movement by creating a \\"special aesthetic\\" for black women \\"to an extent.\\" She claimed, \\"the same rhetoric that is used to establish the Black Aesthetic, we must use to establish a women's aesthetic, which is to say that those parts of reality that are ours, those things about our bodies, the cycles of our lives that have been ignored for centuries in all castes and classes of our people, are to be dealt with now.\\"  Death  Shange died in her sleep on October 27, 2018, aged 70, in an assisted-living facility in Bowie, Maryland.Collins-Hughes, Laura (October 28, 2018), \\"Ntozake Shange, Who Wrote ‚ÄòFor Colored Girls,‚Äô Is Dead at 70\\", The New York Times.

He was born in Clermont-Ferrand, France. √âdouard and his elder brother Andr√© served as co-directors of the Michelin company. Edouard seemed destined for a career as an artist, but around 1888 he and his brother Andre returned to Clermont-Ferrand in order to try to save the failing family business, then a manufacturer of agricultural tools, drive belts and hoses. In 1889, he improved greatly on the design of the pneumatic tyre for bicycles, making tyres easier to change and repair. The invention proved its worth in the Paris‚ÄìBrest cycle event organized by the newspaper Le Petit Journal in September 1891, and Michelin quickly adapted his inflatable tyres for use on motor vehicles, of which France was becoming the world's leading producer. Success came rapidly, and already in 1896 approximately 300 Paris taxis were running on Michelin pneumatic tyres. His company went on to experience tremendous growth serving the fledgling industry around the turn of the century and beyond. In the traumatic weeks that followed the German invasion of May/June 1940, world events overshadowed Michelin's death. Nevertheless, by the time he died he had built Michelin into a major industrial force, with many \\"firsts\\" in wheel and tyre technology to its credit. He had overseen the acquisition of the (then bankrupt) Citro√´n business in 1934: with his son Pierre and their friend Pierre-Jules Boulanger he secured its position as one of Europe's most innovative auto-makers in the 1940s and 1950s, producing models such as the Citro√´n Traction, the revolutionary Citro√´n TUB/TUC light van and the 2CV prepared for introduction at the 1939 Paris Motor Show (which was cancelled at short notice, the war causing the launch of the little car to be deferred). √âdouard Michelin also lived a long life and suffered the personal tragedies of being predeceased by two of his sons, √âtienne Michelin having been killed in a flying accident in 1932 and Pierre Michelin having been killed in a road accident near Montargis in 1937. Like many industrialists, Michelin was a member of the anti-Semitic anti-Dreyfusard camp during the political turmoil over the Dreyfus affair in turn of the century France. His great-grandson, a former CEO and managing partner of the Michelin Group who died on 26 May 2006 in a boating accident, was also named √âdouard. √âdouard and his brother Andr√© were inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2002.Ward's Auto World.

Features =3D= Some Cyber-shot models can take 3D stills by shooting two images using two different focus settings. The technology uses one lens only for the process, and users can later see the images on a 3D TV or on a regular 2D screen. The cameras have been available since 2010. =Geotagging= Some Cyber-Shot models such as the DSC-HX20V, DSC-HX90V, DSC-HX200V and the DSC- HX400V have a built-in GPS so the user can have their photos automatically geotagged as they are being taken. The feature can also serve as a compass as it shows the user's position on the camera screen. =Tru Black= Tru Black is a technology developed by Sony which allows a better visualization of the screen, even when there is too much light. It enables LCD screens to automatically change the display contrast in order to enhance the controlling reflectance. In other words, when light hits a display with Tru Black technology, the screen turns opaque as a means to improve the visualization of the content. =Panorama= All current Cyber-shot cameras are equipped with a panoramic technology branded as Sweep Panorama, which enables the user to capture wide format photographs using only one lens.

Kakamega Forest is a tropical rainforest situated in the Kakamega and Nandi County of Kenya, northwest of the capital Nairobi, and near to the border with Uganda. It is Kenya's only tropical rainforest and is said to be Kenya's last remnant of the ancient Guineo-Congolian rainforest that once spanned the continent.  Geography  The forest lies on undulating terrain, mostly between 1500 and 1600 meters elevation. It is in the watershed of the Isiukhu and Yala rivers, which flow through the forest before emptying into Lake Victoria.\\"The Kakamega Forest\\". Unesco World Heritage Centre. Accessed 15 March 2020. https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5508/ The forest including reserves encloses about 238 square kilometers, a little less than half of which currently remains as indigenous forest. In the north of the forest is the Kakamega National Reserve, given national forest reserve status in 1985. Just to the north is the Kisere Forest Reserve. Throughout the forest are a series of grassy glades, ranging in size from about 1 to 50, with a few larger clearings. The origins of the glades are uncertain. Some are certainly recent clearings, but others predate recent records. These may have originated from past human activity such as cattle grazing or may be the result of herbivory and movements by large mammals such as buffalo and elephants (both now extirpated from the region). The glades vary a great deal in structure, some being open grass and others having a considerable number of trees or shrubs. A number of streams and small creeks run through the reserve. The larger creeks are usually bordered by a few to tens of meters of forest on either side which divide the glades, while the smallest creeks flow through open grasslands, often forming small marshy patches.  Climate  The Kakamega Forest is very wet, with an average of 1200 mm ‚Äì 1700 mm of rain per year. Rainfall is heaviest in April and May (\\"long rains\\"), with a slightly drier June and a second peak roughly in August to September (\\"short rains\\"). January and February are the driest months. Temperature is fairly constant throughout the year, ranging between 20c - 30c.KWS \\"Kakamega National Reserve\\" KWS Website  Biodiversity  right The forest lies in the Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion. The forest's flora and fauna include many species associated with the moist forests of the Guineo-Congolian region, which lie further west in the basin of the Congo River.Burgess, Neil et al. (2004). Terrestrial Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar. Island Press, 2004. pp. 291-292 Flora found in the park include some of Africa's greatest hard and soft woods: Elgon teak (Olea welwitschii), red stinkwood (Prunus africana), white stinkwood, several varieties of croton, and Pouteria altissima. There are 380 recorded species of plants. This includes 60 species of ferns, 150 species of trees and shrubs, and 170 species of flowering plants including 60 species of orchids with 9 species found only in this forest. The forest is famous for its birds, 367Udo M. Savalli, \\"Flora and fauna in Kakamega Forest\\", University of KentuckyUdo M. Savalli, \\"List of birds in Kakamega Forest\\", University of Kentucky bird species have been recorded in the forest such as the west African Great blue turaco and black-and-white-casqued hornbill. At least 9 birds are not found anywhere else.Wildize.org \\"Treasures of the Forest\\" Powerpoint Slide Mammals that occur in the park include bush pig, duikers, bushbuck, African clawless otter, mongoose, giant African water shrew, squirrels, tree pangolin, porcupine, bats and a variety of primates including the blue monkey, redtail monkey, De Brazza's monkey, baboon, potto and the occasional vervet monkey. Leopards have been occasionally reported, but the last official sighting was in 1991 .Harold Ayodo, \\"Kakamega forest may be wiped out in 20 years\\" The Standard newspaper, April 8th 2010 Insects are abundant and some are quite spectacular, such as Goliath beetles, pink and green flower mantis, and numerous colorful butterflies (489 species). Particularly well represented groups are ants (Formicidae), Lepidopterans, Orthopterans, and beetles. Gastropods, millipedes and spiders are also common. The flora and fauna of Kakamega Forest has not been extensively studied.  Environmental issues  Many local inhabitants rely on the forest to supply important resources, such as firewood, building poles and traditional medicines. Cattle grazing occurs in some of the glades. The region is said to be one of the most densely populated rural areas in the world, and pressure on the forest resources is considerable. The German funded project BIOTA East worked in the forest from 2001 until 2010, creating forest inventories for many life forms and aiming to find strategies for a sustainable use of the forest.  Tourism  The Southern part of Kakamega forest, Isecheno Forest station run by the Kenya Forest Service is the most accessible in Tourism. There is the well known Mama Mtere tree, a historic tree and the most photographed tree in Kakamega forest, there are also strangler fig trees.https://www.worldpulse.com/en/community/users/mukoche- khatondi/posts/65309https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/magazines/Kakamega- forest-that-is-home-to-variety-of-species/1248928-1854524-xaavi/index.html There are hiking trails in the forest that allow for forest walking, camping, hiking, primate watching, bird and butterfly watching, game watching and village walks. The Kakamega Rainforest Tour Guides (KRFTG) can arrange tours to visit the weeping stone (Crying stone) at Ilesi, located along the Kakamega-Kisumu road, or Kisere Forest to see the De-brazes monkey in the north of Kakamega.

NƒÅmar≈´pa is a dvandva compound in Sanskrit and Pali meaning \\"name (nƒÅma) and form (r≈´pa)\\". Nama (name) and Rupa (form) is the simple worldly identity of any form by a name both of which are considered temporal and not true identity with the nameless and formless ‚Äòreality‚Äô or ‚ÄòAbsolute‚Äô in Hinduism that has manifested as maya. In Buddhism the loss of all names and forms leads to the realization of the Ultimate reality of ‚ÄòShunyatha‚Äô or ‚ÄòEmptiness‚Äô or Nirvana ‚ÄúNaked Truth‚Äù removed of Maya. In Buddhism This term is used in Buddhism to refer to the constituents of a living being: nƒÅma refers to the mental, while r≈´pa refers to the physical. The Buddhist nƒÅma and r≈´pa are mutually dependent, and not separable; as nƒÅmar≈´pa, they designate an individual being.For example, Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 350, entry for \\"NƒÅma\\" (retrieved 2007-06-20), states: :\\"nƒÅma as metaphysical term is opposed to r≈´pa, & comprises the 4 immaterial factors of an individual (...). These as the no√´tic principle comb[ine]d with the material principle make up the individual as it is distinguished by 'name & body' from other individuals. Thus nƒÅmar≈´pa= individuality, individual being. These two are inseparable....\\" Namarupa are also referred to as the five skandhas, \\"the psycho-physical organism\\", ‚Äúmind- and-matter,‚Äù and ‚Äúmentality-and-materiality‚Äù. =Psycho-physical constituents= In the Pali Canon, the Buddha describes nƒÅmar≈´pa in this manner (English on left, Pali on right): { cellpadding=10 \\"And what [monks] is name-&-form? Feeling, perception, intention, contact, & attention: This is called name. The four great elements, and the form dependent on the four great elements: This is called form. This name & this form are, [monks], called name-&-form.\\"From SN 12.2 (Thanissaro, 1997).  'SLTP (n.d.), 1.1.2, '. } Elsewhere in the Pali Canon, nƒÅmar≈´pa is used synonymously with the five aggregates.Rhys Davids & Stede, op cit. =Empty of self= In keeping with the doctrine of anƒÅtman/anatta, \\"the absence of an (enduring, essential) self\\", nƒÅma and r≈´pa are held to be constantly in a state of flux, with only the continuity of experience (itself a product of dependent origination) providing an experience of any sort of conventional 'self'. =Part of the cycle of suffering= NƒÅmar≈´pa is the fourth of the Twelve NidƒÅnas, preceded by consciousness (Pali: vi√±√±ƒÅna; Skt.: vij√±ana) and followed by the six sense bases (Pali: '; Skt: '). Thus, in the Sutta Nipata, the Buddha explains to the Ven. Ajita how samsaric rebirth ceases: :[Ven. Ajita:] ::...name & form, dear sir: ::Tell me, when asked this, :::where are they brought to a halt? : :[The Buddha:] ::This question you've asked, Ajita, ::I'll answer it for you ‚Äî ::where name & form :::are brought to a halt :::without trace: ::With the cessation of consciousness :::they're brought :::to a halt.Thanissaro (1994). In explaining this specific exchange between Ven. Ajita and the Buddha, Ireland (1983, 1994), n. 2 states: :This question and answer refers to the doctrine of dependent-arising (paticca-samuppada). Where rebirth-consciousness (pati-sandhi-vinnana) does not arise there is no establishment of an individual (mind-and-body, namarupa) in a realm of existence, nor the consequent appearance of old age and death and the other sufferings inherent in life.Specific location of these verses: Sn V.1, Parayanavagga, \\"The Questions of Ajita,\\" verses 1036-1037  In Hinduism The term nƒÅmar≈´pa is used in Hindu thought, nƒÅma describing the spiritual or essential properties of an object or being, and r≈´pa the physical presence that it manifests. These terms are used similarly to the way that 'essence' and 'accident' are used in Catholic theology to describe transubstantiation. The distinction between nƒÅma and r≈´pa in Hindu thought explains the ability of spiritual powers to manifest through inadequate or inanimate vessels - as observed in possession and oracular phenomena, as well as in the presence of the divine in images that are worshiped through p≈´ja. NƒÅma Rupatmak Vishva is the Vedanta (a school of Sanatana Dharma/Hinduism) term for the manifest Universe, viz. The World as we know it. Since every object in this World has a NƒÅma and Rupa, the World is called NƒÅma Rupatmak Vishva. The ParamƒÅtma (or Creator) is not manifest in this NƒÅma Rupatmak Vishva but is realized by a SƒÅdhaka(student) by means of Bhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Jnana (knowledge), Yoga (Union, a Hindu school), or a combination of all of these methodologies.

A light fixture using a ball chain. An electric pull switch is attached to a toggle type switch: one pull to switch on and next pull to switch off. The most common use of a pull switch is to operate a ceiling electric light. The ceiling fan and mechanical wall fans are also appliances often operated by pull switches. Pull switches may be either two-position (open or closed) or multi-position (allowing for different fan speeds or levels of illumination). Mounted inside a pull switch, there could be two types of two-position toggle switches. (In both cases the stable physical open- or closed -situation would be switch in outer and string in upper position.) One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string. The other type would switch to closed (or open) only when releasing after a full pull. With the first type, the weight of the string and handle could accidentally switch the load intermittently on and off, when still around the initial position (depending on the internal spring). This could potentially increase the danger of overheating in the switch. In a damp environment, electrical pull switches have a safety advantage because the user is separated from the electricity by a significant distance if the lead is made of an electrically insulating material, such as cotton string. Most commercially available pull switches use a short length of ball chain, which may then be connected to any number of optional leads for added length or decoration. Leads for decoration or utility are usually made of metal or plastic. They can come in many different shapes ranging from animals, geometric shapes, or look just like a weight.

It is a large and poorly understood '\\"micromoth\\" superfamily, constituting one of the basal lineages of the Ditrysia.Robinson et al. (1994), Hodges (1999), O'Toole (2002) As of the 1990s, this superfamily was composed of about 1,425 genera and 16,250 species. It was estimated that only 25% of the species diversity of Gelechioidea had been described.Hodges (1999) If this estimate is accurate, Gelechioidea will be one of the largest superfamilies of Lepidoptera. The name \\"curved-horn moths\\" refers to one of the few conspicuous features found in (almost) all Gelechioidea, and, at least in the more extreme developments, unique to them: the labial palps are well-developed (though not thickened), and form more or less gently curved protrusions whose end has a drawn-out, pointed tip. Their proboscis is generally well-developed, allowing for long- lived imagines (adults); the proximal part of the proboscis is scaly. Otherwise, the Gelechioidea vary extensively in habitus; most have small hind- wings with long, hairy fringes, though these are not easily seen in the living animal as they are tucked under the fore-wings at rest. The body is usually quite compressed, either dorsoventrally or laterally.Robinson et al. (1994) Families The phylogeny and classification of the Gelechioidea remains a subject of considerable dispute. For example, the Elachistidae were at one time used as a sort of \\"wastebin taxon\\" to unite as subfamilies a variety of plesiomorphic members of this superfamily, which do not actually seem to form a monophyletic group. Many of these have now been moved to the Oecophoridae, but others are almost certainly likely families in their own right, while additional ones may well be so.Hodges (1999), O'Toole (2002), ToL (2009), Wikispecies (2009-OCT-12) In 2011 the superfamily was divided into 21 families, based mainly on morphological studies, with adjustments made for some molecular studies.

Such a structure can be defined by means of an atlas, such that one can pass from chart to chart in it by piecewise linear functions. This is slightly stronger than the topological notion of a triangulation. An isomorphism of PL manifolds is called a PL homeomorphism.  Relation to other categories of manifolds  PDIFF serves to relate DIFF and PL, and it is equivalent to PL. PL, or more precisely PDIFF, sits between DIFF (the category of smooth manifolds) and TOP (the category of topological manifolds): it is categorically \\"better behaved\\" than DIFF ‚Äî for example, the Generalized Poincar√© conjecture is true in PL (with the possible exception of dimension 4, where it is equivalent to DIFF), but is false generally in DIFF ‚Äî but is \\"worse behaved\\" than TOP, as elaborated in surgery theory. = Smooth manifolds = Smooth manifolds have canonical PL structures ‚Äî they are uniquely triangulizable, by Whitehead's theorem on triangulation ‚Äî but PL manifolds do not always have smooth structures ‚Äî they are not always smoothable. This relation can be elaborated by introducing the category PDIFF, which contains both DIFF and PL, and is equivalent to PL. One way in which PL is better behaved than DIFF is that one can take cones in PL, but not in DIFF ‚Äî the cone point is acceptable in PL. A consequence is that the Generalized Poincar√© conjecture is true in PL for dimensions greater than four ‚Äî the proof is to take a homotopy sphere, remove two balls, apply the h-cobordism theorem to conclude that this is a cylinder, and then attach cones to recover a sphere. This last step works in PL but not in DIFF, giving rise to exotic spheres. = Topological manifolds = Not every topological manifold admits a PL structure, and of those that do, the PL structure need not be unique ‚Äî it can have infinitely many. This is elaborated at Hauptvermutung. The Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann class is an obstruction for giving a topological manifold a PL-structure. The obstruction to placing a PL structure on a topological manifold is the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann class. To be precise, the Kirby-Siebenmann class is the obstruction to placing a PL-structure on M x R and in dimensions n > 4 this ensures that M has a PL-structure. = Real algebraic sets = An A-structure on a PL manifold is a structure which gives an inductive way of resolving the PL manifold to a smooth manifold. Compact PL manifolds admit A-structures. Compact PL manifolds are homeomorphic to real-algebraic sets. Put another way, A-category sits over the PL-category as a richer category with no obstruction to lifting, that is BA ‚Üí BPL is a product fibration with BA = BPL √ó PL/A, and PL manifolds are real algebraic sets because A-manifolds are real algebraic sets. = Combinatorial manifolds and digital manifolds = * A combinatorial manifold is a kind of manifold which is discretization of a manifold.

As a scholar, he is credited along with Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat, with being instrumental in turning East Asian Studies into scientific disciplines with critical methods.Walravens, Hartmut. \\"Julius Klaproth. His Life and Works with Special Emphasis on Japan,\\" Japonica Humboldtiana 10 (2006), p. 177. Name H.J. Klaproth was usually known as Julius or Julius von Klaproth. His name also erroneously appears as \\"Julius Heinrich Klaproth\\". Life Klaproth was born in Berlin on 11 October 1783, the son of the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who is credited with the discovery of four elements including uranium.Walravens, p. 178. Young Klaproth devoted his energies in quite early life to the study of Asiatic languages, and published in 1802 his Asiatisches Magazin (Weimar 1802‚Äì1803). He was in consequence called to St. Petersburg and given an appointment in the academy there. In 1805 he was a member of Count Golovkin's embassy to China. On his return he was despatched by the academy to the Caucasus on an ethnographical and linguistic exploration (1807‚Äì1808), and was afterwards employed for several years in connection with the academy's Oriental publications. In 1812 he moved to Berlin.Screech, p. 70. In 1815 he settled in Paris, and in 1816 Humboldt procured him from the king of Prussia the title and salary of professor of Asiatic languages and literature, with permission to remain in Paris as long as was requisite for the publication of his works. He died in Paris on 28 August 1835. Klaproth was an orientalist or an \\"Asiatologist,\\" in that he had a good command not only of Chinese, but also Manchu, Mongolian, Sanskrit, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, and even Caucasian languages. His wide range of interests encompassed the study of the development of individual countries in their Asian context, which contrast with the 21st century focus on specialization. Klaproth's 1812 Dissertation on language and script of the Uighurs (Abhandlung √ºber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren) was disputed by Isaak Jakob Schmidt, who is considered the founder of Mongolian Studies. Klaproth asserted that the Uighur language was a Turkic language, while Schmidt was persuaded that Uighur should be classified as a \\"Tangut\\" language.Walravens, p. 181 n14. Works Klaproth's bibliography extends to more than 300 published items. His great work Asia Polyglotta (Paris, 1823 and 1831, with Sprachatlas) not only served as a r√©sum√© of all that was known on the subject, but formed a new departure for the classification of the Eastern languages, more especially those of the Russian Empire. To a great extent, however, his work is now superseded. The Itinerary of a Chinese Traveller (1821), a series of documents in the military archives of St. Petersburg purporting to be the travels of George Ludwig von , and a similar series obtained from him in the London foreign office, are all regarded as spurious. Klaproth's other works include: * Reise in den Kaukasus und Georgien in den Jahren 1807 und 1808 (Halle, 1812‚Äì1814; French translation, Paris, 1823) * Geographisch-historische Beschreibung des ostlichen Kaukasus (Weimar 1814) * Tableaux historiques de l'Asie (Paris, 1826) * Memoires relatifs a l'Asie (Paris, 1824‚Äì1828) * Tableau historique, geographique, ethnographique et politique de Caucase (Paris, 1827) * Vocabulaire et grammaire de la langue georgienne (Paris, 1827) Klaproth was also the first to publish a translation of Taika era Japanese poetry in the West. Donald Keene explained in a preface to the Nippon Gakujutsu Shink≈çkai edition of the Man'y≈çsh≈´: : \\"One 'envoy' (hanka) to a long poem was translated as early as 1834 by the celebrated German orientalist Heinrich Julius Klaproth (1783‚Äì1835). Klaproth, having journeyed to Siberia in pursuit of strange languages, encountered some Japanese castaways, fisherman, hardly ideal mentors for the study of 8th century poetry.

The purpose of Œ£ŒôŒ° is to promote and reward scholarship and service among students and faculty in higher education so as to foster creative performance and integrity in the conduct of world affairs. Its members are predominantly advanced undergraduates (juniors and seniors) who have demonstrated exceptional academic performance and engagement in international affairs. These individuals are guided by faculty advisors from over 140 colleges and universities with established chapters. Founding Sigma Iota Rho was founded on May 9, 1984, on the initiative of scholars and practitioners who sought a national platform to recognize excellence in international affairs and foster values in the field. Aptly, the Greek letters representative of the society is: sigma (Œ£) denotes synesis, meaning \\"prudence\\"; iota (I) for ideodoi, \\"ideals\\"; and rho (P) for rhomi, \\"power.\\" Its vision statement is: > To promote and reward scholarship and service among students and > practitioners of international affairs and global studies so as to foster > integrity and creative performance in the conduct of international > relations.From the template constitution of the fraternity, accessed 2 Oct > 2020. Among the founders of Œ£ŒôŒ° was the late-Dr. William C. Olson, Ph.D., then-dean of the School of International Service at American University, who served as its first president. Also among the group was Theodore Couloumbis, Ph.D., who determined the society's Greek letters and identity. Currently, the president and national director of SIR are Dr Frank Plantan, Ph.D., co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's International Relations Program. While not a member of the ACHS, Sigma Iota Rho is an honor society. Members Members of Sigma Iota Rho take part in advancing the honor society's cause for furthering study and awareness of international affairs. To this end, they collaborate yearly to produce the Journal of International Relations, the leading undergraduate periodical in its field. Additionally, the national office of the honor society administers an award scheme that funds worthy research projects by fellow members. At the local level, Œ£ŒôŒ°'s chapters routinely host extracurricular events in enriching local campus and communities. Typically these include hosting speaker events, networking events, and fundraising drives for a particular global issue or cause. Induction is based on standards similar to those of Phi Beta Kappa. Students with outstanding academic credentials in international relations, global affairs, and other majors in the domain of international studies are nominated by their local chapters for induction into Sigma Iota Rho. Generally, they undergraduates who are in the top percentiles of their classes and areas of study. Nominees are submitted to the national office of the honor society for verification and approval. Upon induction, students have issued a certificate confirming membership, regalia for graduation ceremonies, and invited to participate in the organization's national networking group on LinkedIn. In effort to distinguish the efforts of those whom serve as models of the honor society, the national office announced in summer 2012 national commendations, the \\"Faculty Advisor\\" and \\"Featured Chapter\\" Awards. The first recipient of the faculty distinction was Francine D'Amico, Ph.D., advisor of Syracuse University's chapter, Alpha Chi‚Äîhoused in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs‚Äîwhich won the Featured Chapter Award. Journal of International Relations The premier undergraduate peer-reviewed periodical for international affairs, the Journal of International Relations () has a physical circulation of over 3,000 copies to over 150 institutions affiliated with Sigma Iota Rho and the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs. Each edition features a special article by a leading voice in international relations. This year‚Äôs edition is marked by Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organization. Past contributors include Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank. Born in 1998 as an in-house journal for the University of Pennsylvania's International Relations Program‚Äîunder the direction of Frank Plantan, Ph.D. and Bruce Newsome, Ph.D. -- it became a national publication in 2004.

They both determine the accounting period in which revenues and expenses are recognized. According to the principle, revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and are earned (usually when goods are transferred or services rendered), no matter when cash is received. In cash accounting ‚Äì in contrast ‚Äì revenues are recognized when cash is received no matter when goods or services are sold. Cash can be received in an earlier or later period than obligations are met (when goods or services are delivered) and related revenues are recognized that results in the following two types of accounts: * Accrued revenue: Revenue is recognized before cash is received. * Deferred revenue: Revenue is recognized when cash is received. Revenue realized during an accounting period is included in the income.  International Financial Reporting Standards criteria  The IFRS provides five criteria for identifying the critical event for recognizing revenue on the sale of goods:http://www.focusifrs.com/content/download/1440/7279/version/1/file/Revenue+Recognition.pdf # Risks and rewards have been transferred from the seller to the buyer. # The seller has no control over the goods sold. # Collection of payment is reasonably assured. # The amount of revenue can be reasonably measured. # Costs of earning the revenue can be reasonably measured. The first two criteria mentioned above are referred to as Performance. Performance occurs when the seller has done most or all of what it is supposed to do to be entitled for the payment. E.g.: A company has sold the good and the customer walks out of the store with no warranty on the product. The seller has completed its performance since the buyer now owns good and also all the risks and rewards associated with it. The third criterion is referred to as Collectability. The seller must have a reasonable expectation of being paid. An allowance account must be created if the seller is not fully assured to receive the payment. The fourth and fifth criteria are referred to as Measurability. Due to Matching Principle, the seller must be able to match expenses to the revenues they helped in earning. Therefore, the amount of Revenues and Expenses should both be reasonably measurable  General rule  Received advances are not recognized as revenues, but as liabilities (deferred income), until the conditions (1.) and (2.) are met. # Revenues are realized when cash or claims to cash (receivable) are received. Revenues are realizable when they are readily convertible to cash or claim to cash. # Revenues are earned when such goods/services are transferred/rendered. Recognition of revenue from four types of transactions: # Revenues from selling inventory are recognized at the date of sale often interpreted as the date of delivery. # Revenues from rendering services are recognized when services are completed and billed. # Revenue from permission to use company's assets (e.g. interest for using money, rent for using fixed assets, and royalties for using intangible assets) is recognized as time passes or as assets are used. # Revenue from selling an asset other than inventory is recognized at the point of sale, when it takes place. = Revenue versus cash timing = Accrued revenue (or accrued assets) is an asset such as proceeds from delivery of goods or services. Income is earned at time of delivery, with the related revenue item recognized as accrued revenue. Cash for them is to be received in a later accounting period, when the amount is deducted from accrued revenues. Deferred revenue (or deferred income) is a liability, such as cash received from a counterpart for goods or services which are to be delivered in a later accounting period. When the delivery takes place, income is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the deferred revenue is reduced. For example, a company receives an annual software license fee paid out by a customer upfront on January 1. However the company's fiscal year ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months worth (5/12) of the fee to its revenues in profit and loss for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to deferred income (liability) on the balance sheet for that year. = Advances = Advances are not considered to be a sufficient evidence of sale; thus, no revenue is recorded until the sale is completed. Advances are considered a deferred income and are recorded as liabilities until the whole price is paid and the delivery made (i.e. matching obligations are incurred).  Exceptions  = Revenues not recognized at sale = The rule says that revenue from selling inventory is recognized at the point of sale, but there are several exceptions. * Buyback agreements: buyback agreement means that a company sells a product and agrees to buy it back after some time. If buyback price covers all costs of the inventory plus related holding costs, the inventory remains on the seller's books. In plain: there was no sale. * Returns: companies which cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future returns and/or have extremely high rates of returns should recognize revenues only when the right to return expires. Those companies that can estimate the number of future returns and have a relatively small return rate can recognize revenues at the point of sale, but must deduct estimated future returns. = Revenues recognized before sale =  Long-term contracts  This exception primarily deals with long-term contracts such as constructions (buildings, stadiums, bridges, highways, etc.), development of aircraft, weapons, and space exploration hardware. Such contracts must allow the builder (seller) to bill the purchaser at various parts of the project (e.g. every 10 miles of road built). *The percentage-of-completion method says that if the contract clearly specifies the price and payment options with transfer of ownership, the buyer is expected to pay the whole amount and the seller is expected to complete the project, then revenues, costs, and gross profit can be recognized each period based upon the progress of construction (that is, percentage of completion). For example, if during the year, 25% of the building was completed, the builder can recognize 25% of the expected total profit on the contract. This method is preferred. However, expected loss should be recognized fully and immediately due to conservatism constraint. Apart from accounting requirement, there is a need for calculating the percentage of completion for comparing budgets and actuals to control the cost of long-term projects and optimize Material, Man, Machine, Money and time (OPTM4) . The method used for determining revenue of a long-term contract can be complex. Usually two methods are employed to calculate the percentage of completion: (i) by calculating the percentage of accumulated cost incurred to the total budgeted cost. (ii) by determining the percentage of deliverable completed as a percentage of total deliverable. The second method is accurate but cumbersome. To achieve this, one needs the help of a software ERP package which integrates Financial, inventory, Human resources and WBS (Work breakdown structure) based planning and scheduling while booking of all cost components should be done with reference to one of the WBS elements. There are very few contracting ERP software packages which have the complete integrated module to do this. *The completed-contract method should be used only if percentage-of- completion is not applicable or the contract involves extremely high risks. Under this method, revenues, costs, and gross profit are recognized only after the project is fully completed. Thus, if a company is working only on one project, its income statement will show $0 revenues and $0 construction- related costs until the final year. However, expected loss should be recognized fully and immediately due to conservatism constraint.  Completion of production basis  This method allows recognizing revenues even if no sale was made. This applies to agricultural products and minerals. There is a ready market for these products with reasonably assured prices, the units are interchangeable, and selling and distributing does not involve significant costs. = Revenues recognized after Sale = Sometimes, the collection of receivables involves a high level of risk. If there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding collectibility then a company must defer the recognition of revenue. There are three methods which deal with this situation: * Installment sales method allows recognizing income after the sale is made, and proportionately to the product of gross profit percentage and cash collected calculated. The unearned income is deferred and then recognized to income when cash is collected. For example, if a company collected 45% of total product price, it can recognize 45% of total profit on that product. * Cost recovery method is used when there is an extremely high probability of uncollectable payments. Under this method no profit is recognized until cash collections exceed the seller's cost of the merchandise sold. For example, if a company sold a machine worth $10,000 for $15,000, it can start recording profit only when the buyer pays more than $10,000. In other words, for each dollar collected greater than $10,000 goes towards your anticipated gross profit of $5,000. * Deposit method is used when the company receives cash before sufficient transfer of ownership occurs. Revenue is not recognized because the risks and rewards of ownership have not transferred to the buyer. * Generally accepted accounting principles * Comparison of cash and accrual methods of accounting * Vendor-specific objective evidence  New Revenue Recognition Standard  On May 28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers. The new guidance is heralded by the Boards as a major achievement in efforts to improve financial reporting. The update was issued as Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09. It will be part of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), and supersedes the existing revenue recognition literature in Topic 605 issued by FASB. ASC 606 is effective for public entities for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017; non-public companies were allowed an additional year. The new standard aims to: * Remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements * Provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues * Improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets * Provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements * Simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer The new revenue guidance was issued by the IASB as IFRS 15. The IASB‚Äôs standard, as amended, is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

These small moths are most easily recognized by their wings. These each consist of many (typically more than 3) narrow strips of membrane around the major veins, instead of a continuous sheet of membrane between the veins. In living moths in the wild, this is often hard to see however. When they are at rest, the \\"plumes\\" partly overlap, appearing as solid wings. But even then, they can be recognized by the wings having a marked lengthwise pattern and uneven edge.O'Toole (2002) They contain two families at most:ToL (2003) * Alucitidae - many-plumed moths * Tineodidae - false plume moths Sometimes, only one family is accepted, Tineodidae being merged into Alucitidae with the Alucitoidea thus becoming monotypic. Most of the roughly 160 described species in the superfamily belong to the many-plumed moths; these include a few rather widespread genera. The false plume moths consist of numerous small and well- distinct lineages; none of their genera have managed to become as successful as the Alucitidae.Minet (1991) Systematics and taxonomy Even though they are \\"micromoths\\", the Aluctoidea are not especially primitive Lepidoptera; the sizable carpenter moths (Cossidae) as well as the butterflies are not particularly distant relatives. The closest living relatives of the Aluctoidea, however, seem to be the plume moths (Pterophoroidea), which like the many-plumed moths have wings consisting each of several narrow straps (though less strikingly so than in the Aluctoidea). However, the taxonomic treatment of the many-plumed moths among the Ditrysia is disputed, mostly because of their unclear relationship to the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea).Minet (1991), O'Toole (2002) In the arrangement used here, the Copromorphoidea are considered obtectomeran Ditrysia, significantly more advanced than the Aluctoidea (which certainly belong to the basal lineages of Apoditrysia). Some authors disagree and instead assume the Copromorphoidea to be closer relatives of the Alucitidae than even the Tineodidae and Pterophoroidea. This splits the many-plumed moths into two lineages, the Alucitidae (as well as the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) being included in an expanded Copromorphoidea, and the Tineodidae affiliated with the plume moth instead. The subfamily Alucitoidea is thus abandoned in this approach. The rationale for doing so is the marked similarity of Alucitidae caterpillars and chrysalises to those of Copromorphoidea. But this may simply be convergent evolution or symplesiomorphies, considering that the Copromorphoidea otherwise appear to possess the characteristic synapomorphies of the Obtectomera, which are absent in Aluctoidea.

Located at the top of the Royal Mile, it is a prominent landmark as its tall gothic spire is the highest point in central Edinburgh, and towers over the surrounding buildings below Edinburgh Castle. The building is a notable example of Gothic Revival architecture and was designed by architects J Gillespie Graham and Augustus Pugin. Constructed between 1842 and 1845, it was originally designed as a meeting hall for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. From 1929 the building was used as a church until the mid-1980s. Today it is the home of the Edinburgh International Festival and is used as a ticket office, information centre and performance venue. History Highland Tolbooth Edinburgh seen from Greyfriars The Hub, seen from Edinburgh Castle In the mid-19th century, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had been meeting in St Giles' Cathedral. At the time, St Giles was divided into four separate churches, each with its own congregation. From 1829-31, St Giles underwent restoration works led by architect William Burn, and the General Assembly had to relocate. Initially, there were plans to restore the remains of Holyrood Abbey to designs by architects J Gillespie Graham and the renowned gothic revivalist Augustus Pugin to provide a new Assembly Hall, but this did not come to fruition. A new church called Knox Memorial church was being planned at the foot of Castlehill, and foundations had already been laid by Thomas Hamilton in 1829. The General Assembly decided instead to use this site and commissioned Graham to design a new building, known as the Victoria Hall. It was built between 1839 and 1844, and a foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria in 1843. One of the church congregations from St Giles, the worshippers of the Tollbooth Kirk, also relocated to the new building in 1843. The General Assembly met here until 1929, when the Church of Scotland reunited with the United Free Church of Scotland, and the amalgamated church decided to use the former United Free Church's General Assembly Hall on The Mound for future assemblies. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland continues to meet on this site to this day. After 1929 the building was used by various congregations as a place of worship, although it was never actually consecrated as a Church. In 1956 it was named the Highland Tolbooth St John's Church. The congregation had been notable for holding services in Gaelic as well as English. In 1979 the Tolbooth congregation united with the nearby Greyfriars Kirk and the Tolbooth Kirk building was closed. The building was then virtually unused until 1999 when it was redeveloped to create offices and a performance space for the Edinburgh International Festival and renamed \\"The Hub\\". The converted building was ceremonially opened by Queen Elizabeth in 1999. =Modern use= Today it is the home of the Edinburgh International Festival and is the central ticketing office, information centre and a performance venue for the International Festival. It is a multi-functional building comprising a performance space and venues for functions, conferences and weddings. The inside houses the Hub Cafe; the central box office for the International Festival; a performance space with a capacity of 420; and two smaller venues, the Glass Room and the Dunard Library, suitable for smaller events. Prior to the completion of the new Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood in 2004, the Hub was occasionally used for meetings of the Scottish Parliament when the Church of Scotland's General Assembly Hall was unavailable. The Parliament returned to the Hub for two weeks following the collapse of a beam in its debating chamber on 2 March 2006. Architecture Pugin's interior has been retained, with contemporary artworks lining the Victorian stair The building is situated on a corner site, at the junction of Castlehill, Johnstone Terrace and the Lawnmarket, at the top of the Royal Mile. Its most prominent feature is the belfry/clock tower and tall pinnacled octagonal spire at its east end, overlooking the Lawnmarket. The old Tolbooth Kirk is considered to be a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture and it is noted for its ornately decorated stonework, carved in the Decorated Gothic style with features such as crockets, pinnacles, gablets and lancet windows. Unusually for a church building, the Victoria Hall was constructed with two floors to accommodate its dual purpose; the ground floor was divided into committee rooms for the General Assembly, and the upper floor was given over to a large chamber which could be used for Christian worship or for the meetings of the General Assembly. Pugin, who had recently designed the Palace of Westminster in London, was experienced in designing buildings that recalled the glories of Medieval Europe, resolved to create a grand, impressive edifice to house the national church of Scotland. The interior of the main hall is decked with an ornate, rib-vaulted ceiling and is lined with carved wood panelling, including a decorated wooden screen, by Pugin and Gillespie Graham. At the east end is an ornate pulpit, topped with a wooden pinnacle, which incorporates elements of the chair of the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, designed by Pugin.

The main character Jet Jungle was created and voiced by Brian O'Shaughnessy. Synopsis Jet Jungle appeared with his black panther Jupiter, red-headed girlfriend Samantha Muller (Diane Appleby) and scientist and faithful friend Prof. Giuseppe \\"Spaghetti\\" Valetti (Victor Melleney). The team would routinely fly off from their island headquarters, Orion's Peak, in a Vertijet at the behest of their government liaison \\"the Minister\\", to battle criminal masterminds and the occasional extraterrestrial menace. Presentation The show was broadcast every weekday at 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon on South Africa's English radio service, Springbok Radio from 1965 with re-runs continuing until the station's close in 1985. It was also broadcast on Radio Rhodesia in Rhodesia (the present day Zimbabwe). It is not known how many of the episodes were actually recorded, or how many of them were rebroadcast, since so little of the Springbok Radio archive exists. There appear to be screenplays and sound bytes available, and a number of archivists have attempted to preserve the work. Sponsorship The enormously successful show, sponsored by Black Cat Peanut Butter and Jungle Oats was used to promote these South African products. Jet Jungle attributed his enormous powers of persuasion to the use of special ingredients, and his mastery of time, caused as a result of exposure to the Star Master, a mysterious entity. They appeared in several episodes similar in vein to the Project Farstar episodes. Sample of the weekly magazine b&w; comic Tie-ins The long-running show had a children's fan club with regular newsletters featuring a one-page black-and-white comic strip serial, which was syndicated in various publications such as Personality. A short-lived full colour Sunday newspaper comic strip followed. A Jet Jungle action figure was produced by Mego Corporation in the 1970s and \\"rediscovered\\" by the Mego Museum in 2005.http://museummego.blogspot.com/2007/02/mego-museum-spotlight- on-jet-jungle_06.html For the Silver Jubilee in 1975, Springbok Radio produced a once-off one-hour comedy show titled 'The Great Gong Robbery' which featured (inter alia) a parody of Jet Jungle, who ultimately solves the mystery and exposes Jupiter as the thief. Characters * Jet Jungle In advertising images, Jet Jungle was portrayed as a muscular man in his prime with a full head of neatly cropped white hair wearing a jet-black superhero body suit with boots leaving only his hands and face exposed. * Jupiter, Jet's black panther, who fearlessly fights evil. Jupiter was referred to as a 'black leopard' by the show's characters, rather than a panther. * Samantha Muller Red haired always wore a green one-piece short sleeved legless jumpsuit and green boots. * Prof. Giuseppe \\"Spaghetti\\" Valetti, the slim bespectacled middle-aged Professor had wavy black greying hair and mustache was always smartly attired in a white Italian suit and bow tie. * Dr Kit, American space expert. * The Star Master a time-lord of the fourth dimension * Minister variously, a good guy and bad guy. Jet's contact in a cloak and dagger government department with links to international intelligence agencies. * Zack, an 8-year-old boy Audio history In 2009, Radio Researchers uncovered several episodes of this program. These are twenty episodes of a storyline entitled 'Project Farstar'. The Jet Jungle theme tune is probably the most striking and distinguishing feature of the series, aside from the all-in-one black suit, vertijet and panther. Words to the Theme tune are: When your world is in trouble / and you need a fighting friend / who will come on the double and keep fighting to the end /Get Jet! Get Jet! / Jet Jungle is the man to get! Jet Jungle. Jet Jungle Jet Jungle is the man to get! / Get Jet! Since television broadcasts only came to South Africa in 1976, the country had followed the Apollo moon missions on radio. The series thus fed the popular imagination about outer-space and children's delight in hearing what would become a virtual retelling of the saga in the form of a fairy-tale. Africa's participation in the event, which sent Jet Jungle and Jupiter as far out as Andromeda, told of things to come. In Project Far Star, Prof Spaghetti voices his concern about defeating the forces of Einsteinian space-time, \\"going out young and coming back old\\". Voices heard on the radio programme include Hal Orlandini, Brian O'Shaughnessy, Diane Appleby =Radio Episodes= * Project Farstar Comic history There is only one digital image of the weekly b&w; comic available online.

Since its discovery in 2005, this sole example was reputed to have exchanged hands privately at the staggering price of $20,000 us. A price record for a single Mego figure. The Jet Jungle Mego figure, a complete boxed edition still with its original packaging, sold for $5,713.98 after 11 bids, on eBay in 2009. A $15 \\"Limited-Edition 8-inch figure of only 500 produced\\" was released by TJ Toys sometime after the winning bid. The figure was bagged not boxed. In 1971, Martin Abrams began purchasing the license rights to popular movies, comic books and television shows for Mego Corp., a toy manufacturing company. Mego produced a variety of dolls in the 1970s and 1980s until the company went bankrupt in 1983, whereupon the rights to produce the Jet Jungle figurine would ostensibly have reverted to its creator. The first Jet Jungle Mego figure to appear on the internet was in 2003 on Megocentral.com. Laurie Halbritter, the then owner of Megocentral.com, purchased one on an auction from Italy. Photos were sent to various collectors but the identity of the figure was not confirmed until the boxed one surfaced in 2005.https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024820/http://www.megocentral.com/vault3.html References External links * Jet Jungle action figure at the Mego Museum * Diane Appleby Link to the voice of Sam * Springbok Radio Sound files including the Jet Jungle Theme! * Project Farstar 20 Episodes * Old Time Radio Researchers Website * Jet Jungle Myspace Page, appears to be run by the Mego Museum * Jet Jungle Facebook Page, a fan site. * A fan remembers Jet Jungle Category:South African radio programs Category:Superheroes Category:Action figures Category:Radio superheroes Category:South African comic strips Category:Radio characters introduced in 1965 Category:1965 radio programme debuts Category:Radio programs adapted into comics ","title":"Jet Jungle"},{"id":"2174235","text":"Shakuntala Looking Back to Glimpse Dushyanta, scene from Shakuntala painted by Raja Ravi Varma Shakuntala, also known as The Recognition of Shakuntala, The Sign of Shakuntala, and many other variants (Devanagari: ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§≤‡§Æ‡•ç, IAST: Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam), is a Sanskrit play by the ancient Indian poet KƒÅlidƒÅsa, dramatizing the story of Shakuntala told in the epic Mahabharata. best of KƒÅlidƒÅsa's works. Its exact date is uncertain, but KƒÅlidƒÅsa is often placed in the 4th century AD.Sheldon Pollock (ed., 2003) Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia, p.79 Origin of KƒÅlidƒÅsa's play Plots similar to the play appear in earlier texts. There is a story mentioned in the Mahabharata. A story of similar plot appear in the buddhist Jataka tales as well. In the Mahabharata the story appears as a precursor to the Pandava and Kaurava's lineages. In the story King Dushyanta and Shakuntala meet in the forest and get estranged and ultimately reunited. Their son Bharata laid the foundation of the dynasty that ultimately led to Kauravas and Pandavas. =Title= Manuscripts differ on what its exact title is. Usual variants are Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õakuntalƒÅ, Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntala, Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õakuntalam and the \\"grammatically indefensible\\" Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam. The Sanskrit title means pertaining to the recognition of Shakuntala, so a literal translation could be Of Shakuntala who is recognized. The title is sometimes translated as The token-for-recognition of Shakuntala or The Sign of Shakuntala. Titles of the play in published translations include Sacontal√° or The Fatal Ring and ≈öakoontal√° or The Lost Ring. A more recent translation by Barbara Stoler Miller (1984) was entitled Sakuntala and the Ring of Recollection. Synopsis Crying of Shakuntala The protagonist is Shakuntala, daughter of the sage Vishwamitra and the apsara Menaka. Abandoned at birth by her parents, Shakuntala is reared in the secluded hermitage of the sage Kanva, and grows up a comely but innocent maiden. While Kanva and the other elders of the hermitage are away on a pilgrimage, Dushyanta, king of Hastinapura, comes hunting in the forest. Just as he was about to slay a deer, VaikhƒÅnas, a sage obstructs him saying that the deer was from the hermitage and must not be slayed. He politely requests the king to take his arrow back. The king follows what the sage said. The sage then informs that they are going to collect firewood for the sacrificial fire and asks him to join them. They then spot the hermitage of Sage Kanva and decide to pay the hermits a visit. However the king decides to go to this penance grove dressed up as a commoner. He also stops the chariot farther away to not disturb the hermits.The moment he enters the hermitage and spots Shakuntala, he is captivated by her, courts her in royal style, and marries her. Soon, he has to leave to take care of affairs in the capital. She is given a ring by the king, which will eventually have to be presented to him when she appears in his court to claim her place as queen. One day, the anger-prone sage Durvasa arrives when Shakuntala is lost in her thoughts, and when she fails to attend to him, he curses her by bewitching Dushyanta into forgetting her existence. The only cure is for Shakuntala to show the king the signet ring that he gave her. She later travels to meet him, and has to cross a river. The ring is lost when it slips off her hand as she dips it in the water playfully. On arrival the king is unable to recognize the person he married and therefore refuses to acknowledge her. Shakuntala is abandoned by her companions who declare that she should remain with her husband. They then return to the hermitage. Fortunately, the ring is discovered by a fisherman in the belly of a fish, and presents it in the king's court. Dushyanta realizes his mistake - too late. The newly wise Dushyanta is asked to defeat an army of Asuras, and is rewarded by Indra with a journey through heaven. After returning to Earth years later, Dushyanta finds Shakuntala and their son by chance, and recognizes them. In other versions, especially the one found in the 'Mahabharata', Shakuntala is not reunited until her son Bharata is born, and found by the king playing with lion cubs. Dushyanta meets young Bharata and enquires about his parents, and finds out that Bharata is indeed his son. Bharata is an ancestor of the lineages of the Kauravas and Pandavas, who fought the epic war of the Mahabharata. It is after this Bharata that India was given the name \\"Bharatavarsha\\", the 'Land of Bharat'. Reception By the 18th century, Western poets were beginning to get acquainted with works of Indian literature and philosophy. Shakuntala was the first Indian drama to be translated into a Western language, by Sir William Jones in 1789. In the next 100 years, there were at least 46 translations in twelve European languages.Review of Figueira's Translating the Orient: The Reception of Sakuntala in Nineteenth- Century Europe at the complete review website. =Sanskrit literature= =Introduction in the West= Sacontal√° or The Fatal Ring, Sir William Jones' translation of KƒÅlidƒÅsa's play, was first published in Calcutta, followed by European republications in 1790, 1792 and 1796. A German and a French version of Jones' translation were published in 1791 and 1803 respectively. Goethe published an epigram about Shakuntala in 1791, and in his Faust he adopted a theatrical convention from the prologue of KƒÅlidƒÅsa's play. Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel's plan to translate Shakuntala in German never materialised, but he did however publish a translation of the Mahabharata version of Shakuntala's story in 1808. Goethe's epigram goes like this: Mueller, Max A History Of Ancient Sanskrit Literature =Education in British India= Shakuntala was disapproved of as a text for school and college students in the British Raj in the 19th century, as popular Indian literature was deemed, in the words of Charles Trevelyan, to be \\"marked with the greatest immorality and impurity\\", and Indian students were thought by colonial administrators to be insufficiently morally and intellectually advanced to read the Indian texts that were taught and praised in England. =Unfinished opera projects= When Leopold Schefer became a student of Antonio Salieri in September 1816, he had been working on an opera about Shakuntala for at least a decade, a project which he did however never complete.Manuela Jahrm√§rker and Thomas Aigner (editors), Franz Schubert (composer) and Johann Philipp Neumann (librettist).

It is commonly prescribed for balance disorders or to alleviate vertigo symptoms, e.g. those associated with M√©ni√®re's disease. It was first registered in Europe in 1970 for the treatment of M√©ni√®re's disease. Medical uses Betahistine is used in the treatment of M√©ni√®re's disease and vertigo. The supporting evidence for the efficacy of betahistine for M√©ni√®re's disease is of poor quality. A 2011 Cochrane review of seven trials consisting of 243 patients with M√©ni√®re's disease concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any beneficial effect of betahistine on symptoms. Most of the trials found a reduction in symptoms of vertigo and to a lesser extent tinnitus, but these effects may have been due to bias in study methodology. Betahistine is also under clinical trials for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Contraindications Betahistine is contraindicated for patients with pheochromocytoma. Patients with bronchial asthma or a history of peptic ulcer need to be closely monitored. Side effects Patients taking betahistine may experience following side effects: * Headache * Low level of gastric side effects * Nausea can be a side effect, but the patient is generally already experiencing nausea due to the vertigo so it goes largely unnoticed. * Patients taking betahistine may experience several hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. In the November 2006 issue of \\"Drug Safety,\\" Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that betahistine may cause several allergic and skin-related side effects. These include rash in several areas of the body; itching and hives; and swelling of the face, tongue and mouth. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. The study authors suggest that hypersensitivity reactions may be a direct result of betahistine's role in increasing histamine levels throughout the body. Hypersensitivity reactions quickly subside after betahistine has been discontinued. =Digestive= Betahistine may also cause several digestive- related side effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for betahistine, states that patients may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth and stomach cramping. These symptoms are usually not serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective range and by taking betahistine with meals. Additional digestive problems may require that patients consult their physician in order to find a possible suitable alternative. =Others= People taking betahistine may experience several other side effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients may experience nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly be attributable to the underlying condition rather than the medication used to treat it. The study by Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reports that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any side effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Betahistine is a strong antagonist of the histamine H3 receptor and a weak agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. Betahistine has two mechanisms of action. Primarily, it is a weak agonist on the H1 receptors located on blood vessels in the inner ear. This gives rise to local vasodilation and increased permeability, which helps to reverse the underlying problem of endolymphatic hydrops. More importantly, betahistine has a powerful antagonistic effects at H3 receptors, thereby increasing the levels of neurotransmitters histamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA released from the nerve endings. The increased amounts of histamine released from histaminergic nerve endings can stimulate receptors. This stimulation explains the potent vasodilatory effects of betahistine in the inner ear, that are well documented. Betahistine seems to dilate the blood vessels within the inner ear which can relieve pressure from excess fluid and act on the smooth muscle. It is postulated that betahistine's increase in the level of serotonin in the brainstem inhibits the activity of vestibular nuclei. =Pharmacokinetics= Betahistine comes in both a tablet form as well as an oral solution, and is taken orally. It is rapidly and completely absorbed. The mean plasma elimination half-life is 3 to 4 hours, and excretion is virtually complete in the urine within 24 hours. Plasma protein binding is very low. Betahistine is transformed into aminoethylpyridine and hydroxyethylpyridine and excreted with the urine as pyridylacetic acid. There is some evidence that one of these metabolites, aminoethylpyridine, may be active and exert effects similar to those of betahistine on ampullar receptors. Chemistry Betahistine chemically is 2-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]pyridine, and is formulated as the dihydrochloride salt. Its chemical structure closely resembles those of phenethylamine and histamine. Society and culture =Brand names= Betahistine is marketed under a number of brand names, including Veserc, Serc, Hiserk, Betaserc, and Vergo. =Availability= Betahistine is widely used and available in Europe, including in the United Kingdom. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the early 1970s for M√©ni√®re's disease, but approval was later withdrawn for lack of evidence of efficacy. The withdrawal was upheld by a US court of appeals in 1968 References Category:Amines Category:H3 receptor antagonists Category:Histamine agonists Category:Pyridines Category:Vasodilators ","title":"Betahistine"},{"id":"2174241","text":"Reinhold Klotz (13 March 1807 ‚Äì 10 August 1870) was a German classical scholar.

Many of Douglas' poems have been compiled in his books, which are self- distributed. He began writing \\"confessional poetry\\" in Chicago in the 1980s before he settled on his present style of \\"poetry-portraits\\". In addition to his poetry he was known for his physical appearance: a tall, heavyset man with long white beard in battered overcoat. In 2006, after 20 years as a Chicago art and music scene performer, Douglas briefly moved to New York City, but soon returned to Chicago. He resumed his pre-music performances in Chicago until he moved to Austin, Texas in 2009. In 2010, Douglas left Austin and moved in with his father in Brodhead, Wisconsin, but did not resume performing until 2014. After moving to Wisconsin, Douglas was diagnosed as autistic. In 2007, a documentary about Douglas entitled THAX was released and presented at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. The Posies 2010 album Blood/Candy takes its title from Douglas' poem written for their 2000 show at Schuba's in Chicago.

Some of the Stone Age rock paintings found among the Bhimbetka rock shelters are approximately 10,000 years old. India's ancient Hindu and Buddhist literature has many mentions of palaces and other buildings decorated with paintings,Wall painting but the paintings of the Ajanta Caves are the most significant of the few ones which survive. Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period. A new style was introduced with Mughal painting, representing a fusion of the Persian miniature with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. Company paintings were made for British clients under the British raj, which from the 19th century also introduced art schools along Western lines. This led to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian roots. Performance of Patua Sangeet by a Patua, with a pattachitra scroll to illustrate, Kolkata Indian paintings can be broadly classified as murals, miniatures and paintings on cloth. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the Kailashnath temple. Miniature paintings are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth. Traces of murals, in fresco-like techniques, survive in a number of sites with Indian rock-cut architecture, going back at least 2,000 years, but the 1st and 5th-century remains at the Ajanta Caves are much the most significant.Harle, 355-361; Wall painting Paintings on cloth were often produced in a more popular context, often as folk art, used for example by travelling reciters of epic poetry, such as the Bhopas of Rajasthan and Chitrakathi elsewhere, and bought as souvenirs of pilgrimages. Very few survivals are older than about 200 years, but it is clear the traditions are much older. Some regional traditions are still producing works.Blurton, 201-203, 209-210, 221-222 Overview of the main genres It seems clear that miniature painting, often illustrating manuscripts, has a very long history,Craven, 219; Harle, 361 but Jain miniatures from about the 12th century, mostly from West India, and slightly earlier Buddhist ones from the Pala Empire in the east are the oldest to survive.Miniature painting; Harle, 361-364 Similar Hindu illustrations survive from about the 15th century in the west, and 16th century in East India,Blurton, 200-201, 209-210 by which time the Mughal miniature under Akbar was also sometimes illustrating translations into Persian of the Hindu epics and other subjects.Blurton, 193; Harle, 373 The great period of Mughal court painting begins with the return of Humayun from exile in Persia 1555, bringing Persian artists with him. It ends during the reign of Aurangzeb who rather disapproved of painting for religious reasons, and disbanded the large imperial workshop, by perhaps 1670. The artists dispersed to smaller princely courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and the \\"post-Mughal\\" style developed in many local variants.Harle, 372-382 These included different Rajasthani schools of painting like the Bundi, Kishangarh, Jaipur, Marwar and Mewar. The Ragamala paintings also belong to this school, as does the later Company painting produced for British clients from the mid-18th century. Modern Indian art has seen the rise of the Bengal School of art in 1930s followed by many forms of experimentations in European and Indian styles. In the aftermath of India's independence, many new genres of art developed by important artists like Jamini Roy, M. F. Husain, Francis Newton Souza, and Vasudeo S. Gaitonde. With the progress of the economy the forms and styles of art also underwent many changes. In the 1990s, Indian economy was liberalised and integrated to the world economy leading to the free flow of cultural information within and without. Artists include Subodh Gupta, Atul Dodiya, Devajyoti Ray, Bose Krishnamachari and Jitish Kallat whose works went for auction in international markets. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.  History of Indian painting  = Prehistoric rock art = The pre-historic paintings were generally executed on rocks and these rock engravings were called Petroglyphs. These paintings generally depict animal like bison, beer and tigers etc. The oldest Indian paintings are rock art in caves which are around 30,000 years old, such as the Bhimbetka cave paintings. = Murals = Mahajanaka Jataka, Cave 1, Ajanta The history of Indian murals starts in ancient and early medieval times, from the 2nd century BC to 8th ‚Äì 10th century AD. There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of Ajanta, Bagh, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave (Tamil Nadu), Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Kailasanatha temple in Ellora Caves. Murals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th-century AD ‚Äì Ravan Chhaya rock shelter. An Ajanta mural of a royal court The pattern of large scale wall painting which had dominated the scene, witnessed the advent of miniature paintings during the 11th and 12th centuries. This new style figured first in the form of illustrations etched on palm-leaf manuscripts. The contents of these manuscripts included literature on Buddhism and Jainism. In eastern India, the principal centres of artistic and intellectual activities of the Buddhist religion were Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramshila and Somarpura situated in the Pala kingdom (Bengal and Bihar). = Miniatures before the Mughals = Early survivals of portable Indian paintings are all miniatures from texts (the great majority) or painted objects such as boxes. Despite considerable evidence that larger paintings on cloth (known as pata) existed, and indeed surviving texts discussing how to make them, not a single medieval Indian painting on cloth is known to survive, unless some Buddhist ones have been taken as Tibetan,Steven Kossak, Jane Casey Singer, Robert Bruce-Gardner, Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet, p. 12, 1998, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Museum Rietberg, , 9780870998621, google books (full view) or from Central Asia. Some of the images recovered by Sir Aurel Stein show Hindu deities (most are Buddhist). Eastern India In eastern India miniature painting survives from the 10th century. These miniatures, depicting Buddhist divinities and scenes from the life of Buddha were painted on the leaves (about 2.25 by 3 inches) of the palm-leaf manuscripts as well as their wooden covers. Most common Buddhist illustrated manuscripts include the texts Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita,Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1999). Introduction to Indian Art,: Munshiram Manoharlal, p.68-70 Pancharaksa, Karandavyuha and Kalachakra Tantra. The earliest extant miniatures are found in a manuscript of the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita dated in the sixth regnal year of Mahipala (c. 993), presently the possession of The Asiatic Society, Kolkata. This style disappeared from India in the late 12th century. The influence of eastern Indian paintings can be seen in various Buddhist temples in Bagan, Myanmar particularly Abeyadana temple which was named after Queen consort of Myanmar, Abeyadana who herself had Indian roots and Gubyaukgyi Temple. The influences of eastern Indian paintings can also be clearly observed in Tibetan Thangka paintings.  Western India  Surviving illustrated manuscripts from Western India, mainly Gujarat, begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards. Initially surviving examples are all Jain. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.Rowland, 341-343}} The manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the Kalpa S≈´tra, containing the biographies of the Tirthankaras, notably Parshvanatha and Mahavira. The illustrations are square- ish panels set in the text, with \\"wiry drawing\\" and \\"brilliant, even jewel- like colour\\". The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive \\"long pointed noses and protruding eyes\\". There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen.Rowland, 343}} =Shadanga of Indian painting= Ancient texts defined six important aspects of painting. These 'Six Limbs' have been translated as follows: # Rupabheda The knowledge of appearances. # Pramanam Correct perception, measure and structure. # Bhava Action of feelings on forms. # Lavanya Yojanam Infusion of grace, artistic representation. # Sadrisyam Similitude. # Varnikabhanga Artistic manner of using the brush and colours. (Tagore.) The subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded. = Early Modern period (1526‚Äï1857 CE) = Mughal painting Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c. 1635 Mughal painting is a style of Indian painting, generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the Mughal Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Mughal style was heavily influenced by Persian miniatures, and in turn influenced several Indian styles, including the Rajput, Pahari and Deccan styles of painting. Mughal paintings were a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. Because the Mughal kings wanted visual records of their deeds as hunters and conquerors, their artists accompanied them on military expeditions or missions of state, or recorded their prowess as animal slayers, or depicted them in the great dynastic ceremonies of marriages. A folio from the HamzanamaAkbar's reign (1556‚Äì1605) ushered a new era in Indian miniature painting. After he had consolidated his political power, he built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri where he collected artists from India and Persia. He was the first monarch who established in India an atelier under the supervision of two Persian master artists, Mir Sayyed Ali and Abdus Samad. Earlier, both of them had served under the patronage of Humayun in Kabul and accompanied him to India when he regained his throne in 1555. More than a hundred painters were employed, most of whom were from Gujarat, Gwalior and Kashmir, who gave a birth to a new school of painting, popularly known as the Mughal School of miniature Paintings. One of the first productions of that school of miniature painting was the Hamzanama series, which according to the court historian, Badayuni, was started in 1567 and completed in 1582. The Hamzanama, stories of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet, were illustrated by Mir Sayyid Ali. The paintings of the Hamzanama are of large size, 20 x 27\\" and were painted on cloth. They are in the Persian safavi style. Brilliant red, blue and green colours predominate; the pink, eroded rocks and the vegetation, planes and blossoming plum and peach trees are reminiscent of Persia. However, Indian tones appear in later work, when Indian artists were employed. After him, Jahangir encouraged artists to paint portraits and durbar scenes. His most talented portrait painters were Ustad Mansur, Abul Hasan and Bishandas. Shah Jahan (1627‚Äì1658) continued the patronage of painting. Some of the famous artists of the period were Mohammad Faqirullah Khan, Mir Hashim, Muhammad Nadir, Bichitr, Chitarman, Anupchhatar, Manohar and Honhar. Aurangzeb had no taste for fine arts, probably due to his Islamic conservatism. Due to lack of patronage artists migrated to the Deccan and the Hindu courts of Rajputana, greatly influencing the styles in these centres. Deccan painting Composite alt= Deccan painting was produced in the Deccan region of Central India, in the various Muslim capitals of the Deccan sultanates that emerged from the break-up of the Bahmani Sultanate by 1520. These were Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. The main period was between the late 16th century and the mid-17th,Harle, 400; Craven, 216-217; Sardar with something of a revival in the mid-18th century, by then centred on Hyderabad. Compared to the early Mughal painting evolving at the same time to the north,Craven, 216 Deccan painting exceeds in \\"the brilliance of their colour, the sophistication and artistry of their composition, and a general air of decadent luxury\\".Harle, 400 Other differences include painting faces, not very expertly modelled, in three-quarter view, rather than mostly in profile in the Mughal style, and \\"tall women with small heads\\" wearing saris. There are many royal portraits, although they lack the precise likenesses of their Mughal equivalents. Buildings are depicted as \\"totally flat screen-like panels\\".Harle, 400-403 (quoted); Craven 216-217 Ragamala paintings, sets illustrating (by evoking their moods) the various raga musical forms, appear to have been an innovation of the Deccan. Beside the usual portraits and illustrations to literary works, there are sometimes illustrated chronicles, such as the Tuzuk-i-Asafiya. A Deccan speciality (also sometimes found in other media, such as ivory)Born, Wolfgang, \\"Ivory Powder Flasks from the Mughal Period\\", Ars Islamica, Vol. 9, (1942), pp. 93-111, Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan, JSTOR is the \\"composite animal\\" a large animal made up of many smaller images of other animals. Rajput painting An 18th- century left Several different styles of Rajput painting developed from the late 16th century onwards in the Hindu royal courts of Rajputana. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Many miniatures were individual album pieces, but there are also illustrated books, and there was at the same time some mural painting on the walls of palaces, forts, and havelis. This especially so in the Shekhawati region, where Marwari businessmen, mainly active in the large cities, competed to have brightly painted exteriors of the houses they maintained in their home region. Rajput painting consists of four principal groupings: # The Mewar school that contains the Chavand, Nathdwara, Devgarh, Udaipur and Sawar styles of painting # The Marwar school comprising the Kishangarh, Bikaner style of painting from Bikaner, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali and Ghanerao styles # The Hadoti school with the Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar styles and # The Dhundar school of Amber, Jaipur, Shekhawati painting and Uniara styles of painting. Pahari painting is the northernmost extension of the Rajput style, but usually treated separately. Pahari painting Krishna and Radha in a Pavilion, 18th century, Pahari style. The Pahari style developed and flourished during 17th to 19th centuries stretching from Jammu to Almora and Garhwal, in the sub-Himalayan India, through Himachal Pradesh. The Pahari paintings can be grouped into two groups- Jammu or Dogra school; and Basholi and Kangra school. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense Basohli Painting, originating from Basohli in Jammu and Kashmir, to the delicate and lyrical Kangra paintings, which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed. Malwa and Jaunpur A new trend in manuscript illustration was set by a manuscript of the Nimatnama painted at Mandu, during the reign of Nasir Shah (1500‚Äì1510). This represent a synthesis of the indigenous and the patronized Persian style, though it was the latter which dominated the Mandu manuscripts. There was another style of painting known as Lodi Khuladar that flourished in the Sultanate's dominion of North India extending from Delhi to Jaunpur. Mysore painting Mysore painting is an important form of classical South Indian painting that originated in the town of Mysore in Karnataka. These paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu Gods and Goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India. The process of making a Mysore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of cartridge paper pasted on a wooden base. A paste made of zinc oxide and arabic gum is made called \\"gesso paste\\". With the help of a thin brush all the jewellery and parts of throne or the arch which have some relief are painted over to give a slightly raised effect of carving. This is allowed to dry. On this thin gold foil is pasted. The rest of the drawing is then painted using watercolours. Only muted colours are used. Tanjore painting Tanjore style painting depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana. Tanjore painting is an important form of classical South Indian painting native to the town of Tanjore in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the Chola rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu Gods and Goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India. The process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or zinc oxide is mixed with water-soluble adhesive and apply it on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild abrasive is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewelry and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewelry. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, dyes are used to add colours to the figures in the paintings. Pattachitra Pattachitra refers to the Classical painting of Odisha and West Bengal, in the eastern region of India.'Patta' in Sanskrit means 'Vastra' or 'clothings' and 'chitra' means paintings. The Bengal Patachitra refers to the painting of West Bengal. It is a traditional and mythological heritage of West Bengal. The Bengal Patachitra is divided into some different aspects like Durga Pat, Chalchitra, Tribal Patachitra, Medinipur Patachitra, Kalighat Patachitra etc. The subject matter of Bengal Patachitra is mostly mythological, religious stories, folk lore and social. The Kalighat Patachitra, the last tradition of Bengal Patachitra is developed by Jamini Roy. The artist of the Bengal Patachitra is called Patua.Giusti, M. and Chakraborty, U. (ed.). Immagini Storie Parole. Dialoghi di formazione coi dipinti cantati delle donne Chitrakar del West Bengal. Mantova: Universitas Studiorum, 2014, Gita Govinda depicted in Pattachitra The tradition of Orisha Pattachitra is closely linked with the worship of Lord Jagannath. Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of Khandagiri and Udayagiri and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars). The theme of Oriya painting centres round the Vaishnava sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and Radha-Krishna, different \\"Vesas\\" of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra, temple activities, the ten incarnations of Vishnu basing on the 'Gita Govinda' of Jayadev, Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, Ramayana, Mahabharata. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the conch-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the hue. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure lamp-black or black prepared from the burning of cocoanut shells are used.The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in Puri, Raghurajpur, Paralakhemundi, Chikiti and Sonepur.  Other regional styles  Madhubani painting is a style of painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state. Themes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs.In this paintings, artists use leaves, herbs, and flowers to make the colour which is used to draw the paintings. = British Colonial period (1757‚Äï1947 CE) = Company painting by Dip Chand depicting an official of the East India Company.  Company style  As Company rule in India began in the 18th century, a great number of Europeans migrated to India. The Company style is a term for a hybrid Indo-European style of paintings made in India by Indian and European artists, many of whom worked for European patrons in the British East India Company or other foreign Companies in the 18th and 19th centuries. The style blended traditional elements from Rajput and Mughal painting with a more Western treatment of perspective, volume and recession.  Early Modern Indian painting  Galaxy of Musicians by Raja Ravi Varma, oil on canvas. Radha and Krishna by M. V. Dhurandhar, oil on canvas. At the start of the 18th century, oil and easel painting began in India, which saw many European artists, such as Zoffany, Kettle, Hodges, Thomas and William Daniell, Joshua Reynolds, Emily Eden and George Chinnery coming out to India in search of fame and fortune. The courts of the princely states of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts. For Indian artists, this Western influence, largely a result of colonialism, was viewed as ‚Äúa means for self-improvement,‚Äù and these Western academic artists who visited India provided the model.R. Siva Kumar (1999) Modern Indian Art: A Brief Overview, Art Journal, 58:3, 14 They did not, however, provide the training. According to R. Siva Kumar, ‚ÄúThis task, which fell on the various art schools established in the 1850s, gave an institutional framework to the Westernization of Indian art.‚Äù The earliest formal art schools in India, namely the Government College of Fine Arts in Madras (1850), Government College of Art & Craft in Calcutta (1854) and Sir J. J. School of Art in Bombay (1857), were established. Raja Ravi Varma was a pioneer of modern Indian painting. He drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting, with his subjects being purely Indian, such as Hindu deities and episodes from the epics and Puranas. Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar (1867‚Äì1944), A X Trindade (1870‚Äì1935), M F Pithawalla (1872‚Äì1937), Sawlaram Lakshman Haldankar (1882‚Äì1968) and Hemen Majumdar (1894‚Äì1948). In the 19th century, according to R. Siva Kumar, ‚Äúselective Westernization for self-improvement gave way to a nationalist cultural counter-stance around the turn of the century -- universally, the first step toward a political resistance toward colonial rule.‚ÄùR. Siva Kumar (1999) Modern Indian Art: A Brief Overview, Art Journal, 58:3, 15 In practice, this materialized as an assimilation of ‚Äúdiverse Asian elements,‚Äù expanding tradition more than reviving it. Leading artist of the time, Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), utilized both the Western-influenced realism and Asian elements which brought him ‚Äúclose to early modernism.‚Äù A reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in historic and more nationalistic Indian art, called as the Bengal school of art, which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India. Bengal school Bharat Mata by Abanindranath Tagore (1871‚Äì1951), a personification of India. The Passing of Shah Jahan by Abanindranath Tagore. The Bengal School of Art was an influential style of art that flourished in India during the British Raj in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators. The Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Ravi Varma and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havel attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore. Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \\"materialism\\" of the West. His best-known painting, Bharat Mata (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Far-Eastern artists as part of an aspiration to construct a pan- Asianist model of art. Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included Nandalal Bose, Mukul Dey, Kalipada Ghoshal, Benode Behari Mukherjee, Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, B.C. Sanyal, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, and subsequently their students A. Ramachandran, Tan Yuan Chameli, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and a few others. The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of modernist ideas post- independence.K. G. Subramanyan's role in this movement is significant. Contextual Modernism The term Contextual Modernism that Siva Kumar used in the catalogue of the exhibition has emerged as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of the art the Santiniketan artists had practised. Several terms including Paul Gilroy's counter culture of modernity and Tani Barlow's Colonial modernity have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‚ÄòContextual Modernism‚Äô is a more suited term because ‚Äúthe colonial in colonial modernity does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonised situations to internalise inferiority. Santiniketan‚Äôs artist teachers‚Äô refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterised imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.‚Äùhttp://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming- polarized-modernities.pdf According to R. Siva Kumar \\"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\\" He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice. The literary critic Ranjit Hoskote while reviewing the works of contemporary artist Atul Dodiya writes, \\"The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya‚Äôs eyes to the historical circumstances of what the art historian R Siva Kumar has called a ‚Äúcontextual modernism‚Äù developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ‚Äô40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II.\\" Contextual Modernism in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture. = Post Independence (1947‚Äï present) = Bengal Women by Manishi Dey During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like Jamini Roy, consciously drew inspiration from folk art. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila Painting in most contemporary way and uses both realism as well abstractionism in her work with a lot of fantasy mixed in to both .Her work has an impeccable sense of balance, harmony and grace. By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences. The Progressive Artists' Group, established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists ‚Äì K. H. Ara, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and F. N. Souza, though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, Manishi Dey, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha and Akbar Padamsee. Other famous painters like Jahar Dasgupta, Prokash Karmakar, John Wilkins, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icon of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai Anand Krishna have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Also, the increase in the discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, appropriated the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous, critics like Geeta Kapur, R . Siva Kumar,http://ngmaindia.gov.in/pdf/The-Last-Harvest-e-INVITE.pdf contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.Their voices represented Indian art not only in India but across the world. The critics also had an important role as curators of important exhibitions, re-defining modernism and Indian- art. Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post-liberalization Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. In this phase, artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. Devajyoti Ray has introduced a new genre of art called Pseudorealism. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images. Vernacular Indian Painting thumb Vernacular art is an art alive (contemporary art), based on the past (the myths, the traditions and the religion) and made by defined groups. Vernacular art is based on the collective memory of this group.

Mechanically powered flashlights were distributed by aid organizations to survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake since electric power was lost for a long period. A mechanically powered flashlight is a flashlight that is powered by electricity generated by the muscle power of the user, so it does not need replacement of batteries, or recharging from an electrical source. There are several types which use different operating mechanisms. They use different motions to generate the required power; such as squeezing a handle, winding a crank, or shaking the flashlight itself. These flashlights can also be distinguished by the technique used to store the energy: a spring, a flywheel, a battery or a capacitor. Since they are always ready for use, mechanically powered flashlights are often kept as emergency lights in case of power outages or other emergencies. They are also kept at vacation homes, cabins, and other remote locations because they are not limited by battery shelf life like ordinary flashlights. They are considered a green technology, because the disposable batteries used by ordinary flashlights are wasteful in terms of resources used for the amount of energy produced, and also contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals which end up in the environment. Dyno torch A dyno torch, dynamo torch, or squeeze flashlight is a flashlight or pocket torch which generates energy via a flywheel. The user repeatedly squeezes a handle to spin a flywheel inside the flashlight, attached to a small generator/dynamo, supplying electric current to an incandescent bulb or light- emitting diode. The flashlight must be pumped continuously during use, with the flywheel turning the generator between squeezes to keep the light going continuously. Because electrical power is produced only when the handle is squeezed, a switch is not needed. Dyno lights were issued to German Wehrmacht soldiers during World War II, and were popular in Europe during the war because the electrical power supply to homes was not very reliable. In addition to \\"squeeze flashlight\\", American soldiers often referred to such lights as \\"squeezy flashlight\\" or even \\"squeegee flashlight\\". A version using a pull-cord was used in World War I. The photo shows the internal mechanism: the L-shaped handle has a gear rack, which spins the white step-up gear, which in turn spins the flywheel on which is mounted both a centrifugal clutch (to allow freewheeling after the lever stops its travel and then returns) and a dark grey magnet, seen on the lower left. The magnet induces an electric current as it spins around the red copper winding, seen on the lower right. The current from the copper winding flows through the filament of an incandescent light bulb (not shown), giving off light. An L-shaped spring returns the handle to its original position after each engagement.  Shake type design  A linear induction flashlight is charged by shaking it along its long axis, causing a magnet (visible at right) to slide through a coil of wire (center) to generate electricity. The linear induction, Faraday flashlight, or \\"shake flashlight\\" is another type of mechanically powered flashlight. It has been sold in the US beginning with direct marketing campaigns in 2002. This design contains a linear electrical generator which charges a supercapacitor which functions similarly to a rechargeable battery when the flashlight is shaken lengthwise. The battery or capacitor powers a white LED lamp. The linear generator consists of a sliding rare earth magnet which moves back and forth through the center of a solenoid (a coil of copper wire) when it is shaken. A current is induced in the loops of wire by Faraday's law of induction each time the magnet slides through, which charges the capacitor through a rectifier and other circuitry. The best designs use a supercapacitor instead of a rechargeable battery, since these have a longer working life than a battery. This, along with the long-life light emitting diode which does not burn out like an incandescent bulb, give the flashlight a long lifetime, making it a useful emergency light. A disadvantage of many current models is that the supercapacitor cannot store much energy in comparison to a lithium-ion cell, limiting the operating time per charge. In most designs, vigorously shaking the light for about 30 seconds may provide up to 5 minutes of light, though the advertised time omits the reduced output of the LED after 2 or 3 minutes. Shaking the unit for 10 to 15 seconds every 2 or 3 minutes as necessary permits the device to be used continuously. It is often viewed as a toy, or an emergency backup for other flashlights. Fraudulent counterfeit versions of these flashlights have been sold, most of which incorporate coin-sized non-rechargeable lithium cells \\"hidden in plain sight\\". The expensive supercapacitor is omitted from the internal components. In some of these fake designs, the \\"magnet\\" is not a magnet or the coil is not connected, and no electricity is generated when the device is shaken. These fraudulent flashlights eventually become useless, since their internal batteries cannot be recharged or replaced, and the case is often permanently glued shut. Crank-powered design Another common type is the windup or crank-powered flashlight, with the light powered by a battery which is recharged by a generator turned by a hand crank on the flashlight. One minute of cranking typically provides about 30 to 60 minutes of light. It has the advantage that it doesn't have to be pumped continually during use like the dyno torch or some shake flashlights. However it may be less reliable as an emergency light, because the rechargeable battery it contains eventually wears out. The lithium-ion cells used are typically rated for around 500 charges. In an alternative \\"Clockwork Torch\\" design, produced by Freeplay Energy, the energy is mechanically stored in a flat spiral wound mainspring, rather than a battery. The owner winds the spring up by turning the crank. Then when the light is turned on, the spring unwinds, turning a generator to provide power to run the light. The purpose of this design, originally invented for use in the developing world, was to improve its reliability and useful lifetime, by avoiding or reducing reliance on a battery. , the original design is no longer made, but updated smaller hand-cranked models using LEDs are available. Other functions German dynamo flashlight from World War I. Pulling the pull-chain spun a flywheel, generating electricity to light the bulb on the front for about 5 seconds. Some mechanically powered flashlights include additional functions and features beyond just a source of light. Models sold as emergency lights have additional functions useful in emergencies, such as flashing red or yellow lights for roadside emergencies, sirens, and AM/FM, weather or shortwave radios. They may also include alternative means of charging the battery, such as an AC adaptor, solar cells, or cords that plug into a car cigarette lighter socket. Crank powered flashlights often have radios and other features. One popular feature is a 5-volt USB charging port for recharging cell phones when an outlet is not available. The quality and long-term reliability of these devices vary over a wide range, from high- reliability mil-spec emergency equipment down to one-time-use non-repairable disposables  \\"Steel mills\\"  The first mechanically powered portable illumination was the \\"steel mill\\", used in coal mining during the 1800s. These lamps consisted of a steel disk, rotated at high speed by a crank mechanism. Pressing a flint against the disk produced a shower of sparks and dim illumination. These mills were only used in coal mines, where a risk of explosive firedamp gas made candle lighting unsafe. Caution was required to observe the sparks, so as not to generate very hot sparks that could ignite firedamp. N. Wood, Newcastle Colliery Working, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers: 1858, page 209 These mills were troublesome to use and were often worked by a boy, whose only task was to provide light for a group of miners. One of the first of these mills was the 18th century Spedding mill,An example of a Spedding steel mill may be seen in Whitehaven museum. the Spedding family having a long association as the agents for the Lowther family of Westmorland and the Whitehaven collieries. Steel mills went out of favor after the introduction of the much brighter and simpler Davy and Geordie lamps from 1815. The mill idea was revived in 1946, based on the developed technology of cigarette lighters and ferrocerium flints. A spring-wound lamp with eight flints was suggested for emergency signalling at sea.

Approximately 30,000 students in 324 schools were affected, including the dissolution of German nursery schools and all higher German language based educational institutions. School teachers in the province were replaced by Italian-speaking subjects. German language based education went underground when private lessons were banned in November 1925. The main organizers were, among many others, priest Michael Gamper and lawyer Dr. Josef Noldin. School books were smuggled from farm to farm and lessons taught by the dismissed German teachers; they were augmented by approximately 500 young female volunteers. The Katakombenschulen focused on the teaching of writing and reading in German. The penalty for being found out was prison and repeatedly caught teachers were deported to South Italy. The 25-year-old teacher Angela Nikoletti died from tuberculosis during a prison term. Josef Noldin was deported to Lipari in 1927.

There are also standards regulating the use of certain types of packaging and closures. To receive the VQA designation, wine must undergo testing by the regulating bodies. The VQA logo does not have a standard location on the bottle, and for some VQA wines the producer has chosen not to display the logo at all.

Maharashtri Prakrit was commonly spoken until 875 CEV.Rajwade, Maharashtrache prachin rajyakarteThe Linguist List Dr.Kolarkar, Marathyancha Itihaas and was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty. Works like Karpurmanjari and Gaha Sattasai (150 BCE) were written in it. Maharashtri Prakrit was the most widely used Prakrit language in western and southern India. History The rise of the Prakrits is dated to the middle of the second millennium BCE when they existed alongside Vedic Sanskrit and later evolved into highly developed literary languages. It is a subject of scholarly debate as to whether Sanskrit or the Prakrits are older with some scholars contending that Sanskrit was born out of the Prakrits. According to the Sanskrit scholar, Rajaramshastri Bhagawat, Maharashtri is older and more vivacious than Sanskrit. Vararuchi, the oldest known grammarian of Prakrit, devotes four chapters of his Prakrita-Prakasha () to the grammar of Maharashtri Prakrit. The other popular Prakrits‚ÄîShauraseni, Ardhamagadhi, and Paishachi‚Äîmerit only one each. This preeminence of Maharashtri is confirmed by Dandin () who, in his Kavyadarsha, grants it the highest status among all Prakrits. Demographics Maharashtri is the most attested amongst all Prakrit languages. It was spoken from Malwa and Rajputana (north) to the Krishna River and Tungabhadra River region (south). Historians agree that Maharashtri and other Prakrit languages prevailed in what is now modern Maharashtra.V.Rajwade, Maharashtrache prachin rajyakarte Maharashtri was widely spoken in Western India and even as far south as Kannada-speaking region.C. V. Vaidya, History of Medieval Hindu India, Being a History of India from 600 to 1200 AD, in 3 vols.: Vol. I, p. 317. Early literature The Gaha Sattasai is attributed to King HƒÅla (r. 20-24 CE). Other Maharashtri Prakrit works include the Setubandha of Pravarasena II, Karpurama√±jarƒ´ and SriHarivijay. The language was used by Vakpati to write the poem Ga√ºdavaho.The Linguist List Dr.Kolarkar, Marathyancha Itihaas It is also used in the dialogue and songs of low-class characters in Sanskrit plays, especially the famous dramatist KƒÅlidƒÅsa. Royal patronage Maharashtri was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty in the early centuries of the Common Era. Under the patronage of the Satavahana Empire, Maharashtri became the most widespread Prakrit of its time, and also dominated the literary culture amongst the three \\"Dramatic\\" Prakrits of the time, Maharashtri, Shauraseni and Magadhi.

A diversity scheme is typically required when using frequencies in the Ka, V, or W-band. The downlink transmissions of satellites cover very large areas, that will have different weather. The site diversity technique consists of linking two or more ground stations receiving the same signal: this way, if the signal is heavily attenuated in one area, another ground stations can compensate it. These intense rain areas, for example, supercells, often have a horizontal length of no more than a few kilometers: putting the ground stations at a sufficient distance the possibility of rain fade in the downlink signal will be reduced. The configuration works when the attenuation is not great at the two stations simultaneously. This is usually a valid assumption. Site diversity systems have been known to minimize disruption of service by major satellite carriers.

They may have once been spoken languages or were based on spoken languages, but continued to be used as literary languages long after they ceased to be spoken. Dramatic Prakrits are important for the study of the development of Indo-Aryan languages, because their usage in plays and literature is always accompanied by a translation in Sanskrit.Woolner, pg. v. Dialects The phrase \\"Dramatic Prakrits\\" often refers to the three most prominent of them, Shauraseni, Magadhi and Maharashtri Prakrits. However, there were a slew of other less commonly used Prakrits that also fall into this category. These include PrƒÅcya, Bahliki, Dakshinatya, Sakari, Candali, Sabari, Abhiri, Dramili, and Odri. There was an astoundingly strict structure to the use of these different Prakrits in dramas. Characters each spoke a different Prakrit based on their role and background; for example, Dramili was the language of \\"forest- dwellers\\", Shauraseni was spoken by \\"the heroine and her female friends\\", and Avanti was spoken by \\"cheats and rogues\\".Banerjee, pg. 19-21 The prakrits varied in intelligibility with Shauraseni being most similar to classical Sanskrit https://archive.org/details/introductiontopr00woolrich while Magadhi Prakrit being most similar to classical Pali. Maharashtri, the root of modern Marathi, is a particularly interesting case. Maharashtri was often used for poetry and as such, diverged from proper Sanskrit grammar mainly to fit the language to the meter of different styles of poetry. The new grammar stuck, which leads to the unique flexibility of vowels lengths, amongst other anomalies, in Marathi.Deshpande, pg. 36-37 The three principal Dramatic Prakrits and some of their descendant languages: ; Maharashtri : Maharashtri was used in the southwestern regions of ancient India, later evolving into the Southern Indo-Aryan languages, including Marathi and Konkani. ; Shauraseni : Shauraseni was used in north-central India, later evolving into the Hindi languages, viz. the varieties of Hindi, the Central Zone of modern Indic, including Hindustani and Punjabi. ; Magadhi : Magadhi was used in eastern India, later evolving into the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, including Bengali, Assamese, Odia, and the Bihari languages (Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili), among others.

His travel chronicle describes the pilgrimage he made to Mecca from 1183 to 1185, in the years preceding the Third Crusade. His chronicle describes Saladin's domains in Egypt and the Levant which he passed through on his way to Mecca. Further, on his return journey, he passed through Christian Sicily, which had been recaptured from the Muslims only a century before, and he made several observations on the hybrid polyglot culture that flourished there. A 13th-century painting showing a Christian and a Muslim playing chess Early life Ibn Jubayr was born in 1145 AD in Valencia, Spain, to an Arab family of the Kinanah tribe. He was a descendant of 'Abdal-Salam ibn Jabayr, who, in 740 AD, had accompanied an army sent by the Caliph of Damascus to put down a Berber uprising in his Spanish provinces. Ibn Jubayr studied in the town of X√†tiva, where his father worked as a civil servant. He later became secretary to the Almohad governor of Granada. In the introduction to his Rihla, Ibn Jubayr explains the reason for his travels. As secretary for the ruler of Granada in 1182, he was threatened into drinking seven cups of wine. Seized by remorse, the ruler then filled seven cups of gold dinara, which he gave him. To expiate his godless act, although it had been forced upon him, Ibn Jubayr decided to perform the duty of Hajj to Mecca. He left Granada on 3 February 1183 accompanied by a physician from the city. Travels Map of the first journey by Ibn Jubair from Ceuta to Makkah =Sea journey from Ceuta to Alexandria= Ibn Jubayr left Granada and crossed over the Strait of Gibraltar to Ceuta, then under Muslim rule. He boarded a Genoese ship on February 24, 1183 and set sail for Alexandria. His sea journey took him past the Balearic Islands and then across to the west coast of Sardinia. Offshore, he heard of the fate of 80 Muslim men, women and children who had been abducted from North Africa and were being sold into slavery. Between Sardinia and Sicily, the ship ran into a severe storm. He said of the Italians and Muslims on board who had experience of the sea that \\"all agreed that they had never in their lives seen such a tempest\\". After the storm, the ship went on past Sicily and Crete and turned south and crossed over to the North African coast. He arrived in Alexandria on March 26. =In Egypt= Saladin and the mamluks assured the protection of xaravan routes that allowed travel to distant lands. Everywhere that Ibn Jubayr travelled in Egypt, he was full of praise for the new Sunni ruler, Saladin. For example, he said, \\"There is no congregational or ordinary mosque, no mausoleum built over a grave, nor hospital, nor theological college, where the bounty of the Sultan does not extend to all who seek shelter or live in them\\". He pointed out that when the Nile did not flood enough, Saladin remitted the land tax from the farmers. He also said that \\"such is his (Salahuddin's) justice, and the safety he has brought to his high-roads that men in his lands can go about their affairs by night and from its darkness apprehend no awe that should deter them\\". Ibn Jubayr, on the other hand, was very disparaging of the previous Shi'a dynasty of the Fatimids. Of Cairo, Ibn Jubayr noted, the colleges and hostels that were erected for students and pious men of other lands by the Saladin. In those colleges, students found lodging and tutors to teach them the sciences that they desired as well as also allowances to cover their needs. The care of the sultan also granted them baths, hospitals, and the appointment of doctors, who could even come to visit them at their place of stay who would be answerable for their cure. One of Saladin's other generous acts was that every day, 2000 loaves of bread were distributed to the poor. Also impressing Ibn Jubayr in the city was the number of mosques, estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000, with four or five of them often in the same street. =In Alexandria= Upon arrival at Alexandria Ibn Jubayr was angered by the customs officials who insisted on taking zakat from the pilgrims, regardless of whether or not they were obliged to pay. In the city, he visited the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was then still standing, and he was amazed by its size and splendour. > One of the greatest wonders that we saw in this city was the lighthouse > which Great and Glorious God had erected by the hands of those who were > forced to such labor as 'Indeed in that are signs for those who discern'. > Quran 15:75 and as a guide to voyagers, for without it they could not find > the true course to Alexandria. It can be seen for more than seventy miles, > and is of great antiquity. It is most strongly built in all directions and > competes with the skies in height. Description of it falls short, the eyes > fail to comprehend it, and words are inadequate, so vast is the spectacle. He was also impressed by the free colleges, hostels for foreign students, baths and hospitals in the city. They were paid for by awqaf and taxes on the city's Jews and Christians. He noted that there were between 8,000 and 12,000 mosques in Alexandria. After a stay of eight days, he set off to Cairo. =In Cairo= Egyptian mamluk in full armour, with lance, shield and sabre He reached Cairo three days later. In the city, he visited the cemetery at al- Qarafah, which contained the graves of many important figures in the history of Islam. He noted thag under Saladin, the walls of the citadel were being extended by the Mamluks with the object of reinforcing the entire city from any future Siege by Crusaders. Another work that he saw being built was a bridge over the Nile, which would be high enough not to be submerged in the annual flooding of the river. He saw a spacious free hospital, which was divided into three sections: for men, women and the insane. He saw the pyramids, but he was unaware for whom they had been built, and the Sphinx. He also saw a device that was used to measure the height of the Nile flood. =In Sicily= In Sicily, at the very late stages of his travels (December 1184 to January 1185), Ibn Jubayr recounted other experiences. He commented on the activity of the volcanoes: > At the close of night a red flame appeared, throwing up tongues into the > air. It was the celebrated volcano (Stromboli). We were told that a fiery > blast of great violence bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and > makes the fire. Often a great stone is cast up and thrown into the air by > the force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and settling at > the bottom. This is one of the most remarkable of stories, and it is true. > As for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal al-Nar [Mountain > of Fire], it also presents a singular feature in that some years a fire > pours from it in the manner of the \`bursting of the dam'. It passes nothing > it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its surface and > then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of all things for His > marvelous creations. There is no God but He. Also striking Ibn Jubayr was the city of Palermo, which he described as follows: > It is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits of wealth and > splendour, and having all that you could wish of beauty, real or apparent, > and all the needs of subsistence, mature and fresh. It is an ancient and > elegant city, magnificent and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly > set between its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads > and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful > place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone known as kadhan > [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town, and four springs gush in its > suburbs.... The King roams through the gardens and courts for amusement and > pleasure.... The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of Muslim > women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about them, and are veiled. Further journeys San Giovanni degli Eremiti, an example of Arab-Norman architecture, combining Gothic walls with Islamic domes, built in Palermo, Sicily, by the Normans.Les Normands en Sicile, p. 54. Ibn Jubayr also travelled to Medina, Mecca, Damascus, Mosul, Acre and Baghdad. At Basra, he saw how Indian timber was carefully used to make Lateen sail ships. He returned in 1185 by way of Sicily. His path was not without troubles, including a shipwreck. On both occasions, he travelled on Genoese ships. Frequently quoted is Ibn Jubayr's famous description of Muslims prospering under the Christian Crusaders' Kingdom of Jerusalem: > We moved from Tibnin - may God destroy it - at daybreak on Monday. Our way > lay through continuous farms and ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were > all Muslims, living comfortably within the Franks.... They surrender half > their crops to the Franks at harvest time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one > dinar and five qirat for each person. Other than that they are not > interfered with, save for a light tax on the fruit of their trees. The > houses and all their effects are left to their full possession. All the > coastal cities occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their > rural districts, the villages and farms, belong to the Muslims. But their > hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike them in ease and > comfort are their brethren in the Muslim regions under their (Muslim) > governors. This is one of the misfortunes afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim > community bewails the injustice of the landlord of its own faith, and > applauds the conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and > is accustomed to justice from him. Later life Jubayr travelled to the East on two further occasions (1189‚Äì1191 and 1217) without leaving any account. He died on the 29 November 1217 in Alexandria, during the second trip. Overview and publication Ibn Jubayr provides a highly-detailed and graphic description of the places he visited during his travels. The book differs from other contemporary accounts in not being a mere collection of toponyms and descriptions of monuments but containing observation of geographical details as well as cultural, religious and political matters. Particularly interesting are his notes about the declining faith of his fellow Muslims in Palermo after the recent Norman conquest and about what he perceived as the Muslim-influenced customs of King William II of Sicily under the Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture. His writing is a foundation of the genre of work called Rihla, or the creative travelogue. It is a mix of personal narrative, description of the areas traveled and personal anecdotes. Ibn Jubayr's travel chronicle served as a model for later authors, some of whom copied from it without attribution. Ibn Juzayy, who wrote the account of Ibn Battuta's travels in around 1355 AD, copied passages that had been written 170 years earlier by Ibn Jubayr that described Damascus, Mecca, Medina and other places in the Middle East. Passages copied from Ibn Jubayr are also found in the writings of al-Sharishi, al-Abdari and Al-Maqrizi. A surviving copy of Ibn Jubayr's manuscript is preserved in the collection of the Leiden University Library. The 210-page manuscript was produced in Mecca in 875 AH (1470 AD) and appears to have been written at high speed: diacritic marks are often missing, words are omitted and there is confusion between certain pairs of letters. The complete Arabic text was first published in 1852 by the orientalist William Wright. An updated edition was published in 1907 by Michael Jan de Goeje. A translation into Italian by Celestino Schiaparelli was published in 1906, a translation into English by Ronald Broadhurst was published in 1952, and a translation into French by Maurice Gaudefroy- Demombynes appeared in three volumes between 1949 and 1956. In popular culture Jubair is widely identified as Jubair Al-Hakim from the video game series Assassin's Creed, where he preaches in Damascus before being killed by the protagonist, Alta√Ør Ibn-La'Ahad.

This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in stable homotopy theory. (A related phenomenon in computer science is currying, where the cartesian product is adjoint to the hom functor.) Informally this is referred to as Eckmann‚ÄìHilton duality.  Eckmann‚ÄìHilton duality  The loop space is dual to the suspension of the same space; this duality is sometimes called Eckmann‚ÄìHilton duality. The basic observation is that :[\\\\Sigma Z,X] \\\\approxeq [Z, \\\\Omega X] where [A,B] is the set of homotopy classes of maps A \\\\rightarrow B, and \\\\Sigma A is the suspension of A, and \\\\approxeq denotes the natural homeomorphism. This homeomorphism is essentially that of currying, modulo the quotients needed to convert the products to reduced products. In general, [A, B] does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces A and B. However, it can be shown that [\\\\Sigma Z,X] and [Z, \\\\Omega X] do have natural group structures when Z and X are pointed, and the aforementioned isomorphism is of those groups. (See chapter 8, section 2) Thus, setting Z = S^{k-1} (the k-1 sphere) gives the relationship :\\\\pi_k(X) \\\\approxeq \\\\pi_{k-1}(\\\\Omega X). This follows since the homotopy group is defined as \\\\pi_k(X)=[S^k,X] and the spheres can be obtained via suspensions of each-other, i.e. S^k=\\\\Sigma S^{k-1}.Topospaces wiki - Loop space of a based topological space  See also  * Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space * Free loop * Fundamental group * List of topologies * Loop group * Path (topology) * Quasigroup * Spectrum (topology) References * * Category:Topology Category:Homotopy theory Category:Topological spaces ","title":"Loop space"},{"id":"2174333","text":"Dantidurga (reigned 735‚Äì756 CE), also known as Dantivarman or Dantidurga II was the founder of the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta.Reu (1933), p54 His capital was based in Gulbarga region of Karnataka. His successor was his uncle Krishna I who extended his kingdom to all of Karnataka. The Ellora record of Dantidurga narrates that he defeated the Chalukyas in 753 and took the titles Rajadhiraja and Parameshvara. The inscription calls him son of Indra II.

Originally released in March 2006 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox it was later released for the PlayStation Portable as The Godfather: Mob Wars, Xbox 360 as The Godfather, Wii as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, and PlayStation 3 as The Godfather: The Don's Edition. The game is based upon the 1972 film The Godfather and tells the story of a non-canon character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, and places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable. The Godfather received generally positive reviews across most systems, although the PlayStation Portable version was commonly seen as inferior to the others. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million units. In 2009, a sequel was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. Based on the 1974 film, The Godfather Part II, the sequel did not sell as well nor do as well with critics as had the original, and EA scrapped plans for an adaptation of the third film. Gameplay The Godfather is an open world action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the player controls Aldo Trapani as he ascends through the ranks of the Corleone family, with his rise intersecting with the narrative of the film on numerous occasions. The basic gameplay and game mechanics are similar to most open world titles as the player can travel across the city freely, commandeer vehicles, do whatever they want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish. =Combat= HUD shows the mini-map on the bottom right, Aldo's currently selected weapon and ammo on the bottom left, his health, experience bar and funds on the top left, and his currently targeted opponent's health and family affiliation on the top right. Much of the game is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a .38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as projectiles such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting reticule appears on-screen. The longer the player is locked on, the smaller the reticule gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will no longer be able to run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a knee shot, also stunning the target. The other mode of combat in the game is melee combat, for which the game uses a system dubbed \\"BlackHand\\", after the Black Hand extortion method. Once the player has locked onto an NPC, either hostile or non-hostile, they use the right analog stick to engage in melee combat. The system allows for light attacks, heavy attacks and directional attacks. It also allows the player to swing the opponent around, drag them, strangle them, lift them to their feet if they fall to their knees, slam them against walls, smash their head against counters, throw them over ledges and out windows, and perform execution maneuvers when the opponent is suitably weakened. Players can also wield numerous melee weapons, such as baseball bats, tire irons, police batons, and wrenches. For the PlayStation 3 Don's Edition and the Wii Blackhand Edition, the BlackHand system has been enhanced, utilizing the motion sensor capabilities of the SIXAXIS and the Wii Remote. =Extortion and rival families= The intimidation mechanic in The Godfather. Note the multicolored bar on the top right. The blue meter represents the current level of intimidation. The green line represents the point at which the shopkeeper will agree to pay protection money. The red area indicates the level of intimidation at which the shopkeeper will fight back. A major part of The Godfathers gameplay is extorting businesses. The player must extort business to earn enough respect to level up, to complete certain missions, and to earn money. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with a green bar and a red bar. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter fills up to the green bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, the more money the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, the amount of money paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the red zone. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player will occasionally have the option of carrying out a favor for a business owner rather than intimidating them. This can involve carrying out a hit on someone, scaring someone, or going to a particular location at a particular time. If the player chooses to perform the favor, the amount of protection money paid by the owner will be maximized. There are five main geographical regions in the game; Little Italy (controlled by the Corleone family), Brooklyn (controlled by the Tattaglia family), New Jersey (controlled by the Stracci family), Hell's Kitchen (controlled by the Cuneo family) and Midtown (controlled by the Barzini family). At the start of the game, the entire map is available for the player to explore, but the game encourages the player to remain in Little Italy, as it is the easiest area of which to gain control. To completely control an area, the player must extort all business and rackets owned by the other families, and take over their warehouses and hubs. Many businesses serve as fronts to rackets, which can be taken over in a similar manner to the front, although in the case of a racket, the player has the option of simply buying the racket boss out. Controlling rackets yield the player more money than extorting businesses. The player can also gain control of warehouses and hubs. Warehouses supply rackets, and hubs supply warehouses. Both warehouses and hubs are heavily guarded, and the player must fight their way inside, and find the boss, who they can then intimidate as with business owners and racket bosses. Warehouses pay out more than rackets and hubs pay out more than warehouses. Ultimately, the player must tackle the enemies' strongest holdout - their compound. Once the compound is destroyed, that family has been defeated. To destroy a compound, the player must fight their way inside and then plant a bomb. All compounds have two buildings, both of which must be bombed, and are heavily guarded by soldiers and enforcers aligned with the controlling family. =Vendetta and heat= As the player takes over rival families' businesses and kills their men, their vendetta level will rise. If it gets too high, a mob war will break out. This results in members of the opposing family attacking the player on sight, and going after Corleone-owned businesses, rackets, warehouses and hubs. The only way to win a mob war is to either bomb a rival family business in retaliation or bribe an FBI agent to distract the opposing family until the vendetta level has lowered. As well as vendetta levels, the player must also be aware of \\"heat\\" during the game. Shooting rival family members in public, killing innocent people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore them for a while. Alternatively, bribing a police captain will earn the player a specific among of time during which the police will turn a blind eye to illegal actions. In the Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 3 versions, bribed police will fight on the player's side in shootouts with rival families. Also in the Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 3 versions, the player can blackmail rather than bribe the captain, but only if certain information has been learned from an NPC about the captain's activities. =Rank= In addition to extorting businesses and attempting to destroy rival families, the player must also engage in story missions. Completing story missions is the only way for the player to advance in rank in the Corleone family, moving from Outsider through the ranks of Enforcer, Associate, Soldier, Capo, Underboss, Don and, finally, Don of NYC. However, completing all of the storyline missions will only take the player to the level of Underboss. To achieve the Don of NYC level, the player must take over all rival businesses, rackets, warehouses, and hubs, destroy all compounds, and own every safehouse. Apart from progressing in rank in the Corleone family, the other method of progression in the game involves \\"Respect.\\" Earning respect allows the player to level up, which awards skill points to spend on various attributes. Respect can be earned by numerous means, such as completing missions, extorting businesses, taking over rackets, blowing up safes, bribing police officers, robbing banks, successfully flirting with women, entering new areas, carrying out execution maneuvers, or performing hits and favors. Plot The game begins in Little Italy in 1936. Johnny Trapani (voiced by Adam Harrington), an intermediate ranking member of the Corleone family, is meeting his wife Sarafina (Sirenetta Leoni) when their bakery explodes. Trapani is ambushed and gunned down by soldiers from the Barzini family, with Emilio Barzini (Michael Kopsa) telling him \\"sorry Johnny, it's just business.\\" Moments later, Trapani's son Aldo (Andrew Pifko) arrives, and is comforted by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando/Doug Abrahams), who tells him that when he is old enough and the time is right, he will have his revenge. The game then jumps to 1945, with Aldo returning from World War II after serving in the U.S. Army. Sarafina comes to see Vito at his daughter's wedding, telling him that Aldo has fallen in with a disreputable group of young thieves. Vito sends Luca Brasi (Garry Chalk) to find Aldo and recruit him into the family. After teaching Aldo how to fight and earn protection money, Brasi sends him to meet Paulie Gatto (Tony Alcantar), who introduces him to Corleone associate Marty \\"Monk\\" Malone (Jason Schombing). Gatto has been assigned to take revenge on two men who attacked the daughter of the local undertaker Bonasera, a friend of Vito's. Gatto, Monk, and Aldo beat up the men, and Aldo then joins Brasi on a mission to meet with Bruno Tattaglia (Joe Paulino) and Virgil Sollozzo (Richard Newman). Several days previously, Vito refused to enter the cocaine trade with Sollozzo. Knowing that Sollozzo feels angered by this refusal, Vito is worried about revenge, and has sent Brasi to pretend he is unhappy working for the Corleones and wishes to join the Tattaglia family, who are supporting Sollozzo. However, Bruno and Sollozzo kill Brasi, witnessed by Aldo through a window. He flees, meeting Monk and his sister Frankie (Jennifer Copping). As Aldo explains what happened, there is an attempted hit on Vito nearby. Aldo ensures Frankie is safe before helping Fredo Corleone (Andrew Moxham) transport Vito to the hospital. Aldo then heads to the Corleone compound, where he meets caporegimes Peter Clemenza (Doug Abrahams) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda), acting Don Sonny Corleone (James Caan), and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). Impressed with Aldo's bravery, Tom gives him the rank of Enforcer, and Clemenza sends him to guard Vito in the hospital. Whilst there, Aldo meets Frankie, and the two make plans to go on a date. Meanwhile, Michael Corleone (Joseph May) arrives, and finds all the Corleone guards gone, except Aldo. As a Tattaglia hit squad arrives, Aldo gets Frankie out of the building while Michael has a nurse move Vito's bed. Aldo guns down the assassins before corrupt police led by Captain Marc McCluskey (Doug Abrahams), who is on Sollozzo's payroll, arrive and threaten Aldo and Michael. However, Tom arrives and claims that they are private detectives legally employed to guard Vito, and the police reluctantly leave. At the compound, Tom promotes Aldo to Associate. Realizing it was Paulie who sold Vito out to Sollozzo, Sonny orders Clemenza to have him killed; in turn, Clemenza assigns the hit to Aldo. After Gatto is dead, Tom sends Aldo to accompany family soldier Rocco Lampone (Michael Dobson) to Hollywood to persuade ill-tempered studio executive Jack Woltz (Doug Abrahams) to give Vito's godson Johnny Fontane the starring role in a new film. Rocco and Aldo decapitate Woltz' prized stallion, and place the head in his bed as he sleeps, terrifying him into casting Fontane. Back in New York, the Corleones purchase an apartment in Midtown for Aldo and Frankie. Sollozzo and McClusky arrange a meeting with Michael to try to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. However, Michael wants to assassinate them, and Clemenza has Aldo hide a gun in the toilet of the restaurant where the meeting is taking place. Aldo then drives Michael to the docks, where he leaves for Sicily. Meanwhile, Vito is released from the hospital and has Aldo promoted to Soldier, officially making him a made man of the Corleone family. Shortly thereafter, a group of Tattaglia soldiers kill Frankie. Sonny tells Aldo that Bruno Tattaglia ordered the hit, and is hiding at his funeral home. A furious Aldo heads there and kills Bruno. As Aldo returns to the compound, Sonny speeds off in a car. Carlo Rizzi has attacked Sonny's sister, and Sonny is heading to their house to kill him. On his way, he is killed by a Tattaglia hit squad. Aldo arrives moments later, interrogating the leader, who tells him the hit was not ordered by Philip Tattaglia (Bill Meilen), but by Emilio Barzini, who is secretly pulling Tattaglia strings. Upon hearing of Sonny's death, Vito calls an end to the war and arranges to meet the heads of the families. At the meeting, he assures Tattaglia there will be no retribution for the death of Sonny, on the condition that Michael be allowed to safely return to America. The families agree to this, and Vito makes peace with Tattaglia. After Michael returns, he becomes the new Don, with Vito retiring, and shortly thereafter, dying. Michael promotes Aldo to Caporegime. Learning the FBI are conducting an investigation into the Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk to find out what they know. When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before escaping. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo he knew there was an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to smoke out the culprit. Aldo follows Monk, who admits he blamed the Corleone family for Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Incredulous with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him. Aldo returns to the compound to see Tessio held at gun point. Tom explains Tessio had set Michael up to be murdered - he had arranged a meeting between Michael and the Barzini family at which Michael would be killed. Aldo heads to the meeting with Tessio, killing the Barzini assassins and then killing Tessio. Michael then summons Aldo to a church in Little Italy where he is acting as godfather for his sister's son. During the ceremony, Michael has Aldo assassinate the heads of the four families‚ÄîVictor Stracci, Carmine Cuneo, Philip Tattaglia, and Emilio Barzini. With the aid of Clemenza, Willi Cicci (Gavin Hammon), Rocco Lampone and Al Neri (Terence McGovern), Aldo carries out each hit, finally avenging the death of his father at the hands of Barzini. Michael then promotes Aldo to Underboss. If the player keeps playing at this point, and Aldo bombs all four rival family compounds, he is promoted to Don of New York. Development =Early news= The Godfather was first announced by Electronic Arts on March 10, 2004. Speaking at the Bear Stearns Media, Entertainment & Information Conference in Palm Beach, Florida, EA's CFO Warren Jensen confirmed rumors that EA were working on a Godfather game. No other details were revealed except for the fact that it would \\"likely be an M-rated game,\\" making it EA's first ever M-rated title. The game was first shown at the 2004 Spike Video Game Awards on December 14. Slated for a third quarter release in 2005 on as yet unspecified current generation systems, EA showed a pre-rendered cutscene depicting Vito Corleone drinking wine, scratching his cheek, and then looking into the camera and saying \\"Some day, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this, as a gift.\\" Gameplay details remained unknown until January 2005, when Famitsu published an interview with producer Hunter Smith. He revealed the game would be an open world title in the vein of the Grand Theft Auto games, and that, at present, developers EA Redwood Shores had one-hundred-and-twenty staff working full-time on the game, with that number expected to increase to two-hundred in the coming months. He stated that although the game itself was only 15% complete, the narrative was finalized; players would control an original character who begins as a small-time member of the Corleone family, and must work his way up through the ranks. He stated that EA had wanted to make an open-world game for some time; \\"We wanted to make a title with the same style of open world, but with a strong background, one where you build human relationships while creating your own story.\\" He also explained that the player's progression path through the game could be determined by the player, but would intersect with the plot of the film at certain points, and the player would get to participate in famous scenes from the movie; \\"It's constructed so that players will appear in the scene and will feel as if they are alive within it.\\" On February 1, The Hollywood Reporter revealed Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall had been hired to reprise their roles as Vito Corleone, Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen, respectively. All three had also allowed EA to use their likenesses in the game, with both Caan and Duvall doing facial motion capture work. Although Brando had died in July of the previous year, he had recorded dialogue for the game prior to his death, in what was his last acting job. It was also revealed that EA had acquired the rights to Nino Rota's score for the film. Later that same day, EA released its first official statement regarding the game, announcing it was being released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Portable. Executive producer David De Martini stated \\"We are incredibly excited and honored to have the opportunity to bring the fiction of The Godfather to life in a video game. The Godfather movies raised the standard for cinematic achievement with their high level of drama and intense storytelling, and in fall 2005 gamers will be able to experience that dangerous and living world of The Godfather for themselves.\\" The game officially premiered on February 10, in a red carpet event held in Little Italy, with James Caan, Robert Duvall and Johnny Martino (who played Paulie Gatto in the film) in attendance. At the event, it was announced that a playable demo would not be available until the E3 event in May. David De Martini explained the game had already been in development for two years, including a full year of preproduction and research. He revealed the developers had worked closely with Mark Winegardner, author of The Godfather Returns, to ensure the storyline stayed within the canon of the narrative, and maintained the correct tone. De Martini also stated that as well as Rota's score, Bill Conti and Ashley Irwin had composed one-hundred minutes of new music for the game. =Open world= In the build-up to E3 in May, EA announced the game would also be released for a next-generation platform; the Xbox 360. At the event itself, a playable demo was made available to journalists, but not to the public. The demo debuted the \\"BlackHand\\" control system, which had been developed by the inventor of the swing mechanism in the Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise. Speaking to GameSpot in June, David De Martini stated the original idea for the project was Paramount's, who first approached EA about a game adaptation of the film in early 2003. After numerous meetings, the concept was decided upon; a \\"dual-story\\" game that would feature a character moving through an open world and rising through the ranks of the Corleone family, whilst at the same time, following the plot of the film. De Martini explained He stated \\"We wanted the game to heavily focus on what went on behind the scenes and in the living world. Not the ordering around but rather the actual activities that the order takers had to do on a daily basis to move the family interests forward.\\" He also promised the game would be unlike any other open world game; =Delay and release= Al Pacino turned down the offer to voice Michael Corleone, and also declined to lend his likeness to the game, instead deciding to lend it to Scarface: The World Is Yours. In July, The New York Times reported that Marlon Brando would not be voicing all of Vito Corleone's dialogue. Although Brando did record dialogue prior to his death, \\"his actual voice will not appear in the game [...] rather, his recordings are guiding a professional voice mimic.\\" The article claimed that Brando's ailing health meant he could only breathe with the aid of an oxygen tank, the noise of which was picked up on the audio recordings, making them unusable in the game. After publication of the article, EA confirmed \\"we recorded multiple sessions with a sound-alike to capture the entire performance of the Don Vito character, something we were not able to do with Mr. Brando.\\" However, they hoped that some of his audio may still make it into the game. Although it was already known that Al Pacino had turned down the opportunity to voice Michael Corleone, the article also revealed he had refused to lend his likeness to the game. Instead, Pacino had allowed Radical Entertainment to use his likeness for their upcoming game for Sierra Entertainment, Scarface: The World Is Yours. On July 13, EA announced the game would also be ported to the Wii. Although they revealed no further information, they did state the port would be custom built to take advantage of the Wii Remote. The following day, they announced the initial release of the game had been pushed to March 2006 so as to \\"ensure quality.\\" De Martini explained \\"The Godfather is one of the most cherished franchises in entertainment. Releasing the game in early 2006 allows us more time to perfect the open-world experience of being a member of the Corleone family.\\" In January 2006, speaking to GameSpot, De Martini said of the delay, \\"When you are dealing with a property like The Godfather, you have to take special care in making sure your work meets the level fans have come to expect from the franchise. With this fiction in our game, we had to hit a home run. I am tremendously thankful that EA gave our team the time we needed to get it right. I think it turned a good game into a great one.\\" In an interview with IGN, he further explained, On January 18, EA confirmed the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions would be released in March, with the PSP and Xbox 360 versions scheduled for later in the year. On January 26, it was announced the game would be released in North America on March 21. The game went gold on March 14. =Francis Ford Coppola reaction= Francis Ford Coppola was unimpressed with the game, and claimed Paramount did not consult him about its development. In April 2005, Francis Ford Coppola, director of the three Godfather films, was asked about the game on AMC's Sunday Morning Shootout. He responded, However, the game's executive producer, David De Martini, implied Coppola did know about the game well in advance of its development, stating, =Puzo lawsuit= In June 2008, Anthony Puzo, son of author Mario Puzo, sued Paramount Pictures, claiming that a 1992 agreement between his father and Paramount entitled the author (or, as Mario had died in 1999, his estate) to a share of the profits generated from any audio-visual products based on or using elements of the films or novels. The court filing stated, \\"In material breach of the audio-visual products agreement, Paramount has failed and refused to pay the Puzo Estate the sums due it in respect of the Godfather game.\\" In February 2009, Puzo won the suit, with Paramount paying out an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the region of several million dollars. =Ports and adaptations= PlayStation Portable The PlayStation Portable version of the game was announced on February 1, 2005, alongside the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions. Originally scheduled for release with the other versions in Fall 2005, and then rescheduled for March 2006, the game was ultimately released in September 2006. There was no indication the PSP version would be a different game until July 11, 2006, when Electronics Boutique and GameStop changed their listing from simply The Godfather to The Godfather: Mob Wars, although there was no change in the game's content description on either website. The following day, EA confirmed the PSP version would indeed be called Mob Wars and would not be the same game as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions. At a press event on July 13, 2006, EA debuted Mob Wars. The main difference between this version and the others is that Mob Wars does not feature an open-world environment in which the player is free to move around and extort whatever businesses they wish. Instead, the game features two distinct game modes; \\"Story Mode\\" and \\"Mob Wars.\\" The \\"Mob Wars\\" mode replaces the open world element from the other versions of the game and is played from a top down view in which the player moves units in a turn-based strategy fashion, attempting to capture space owned by the rival families. An important element in this is a card battling mini-game which features a pool of over two-hundred cards with effects such as lowering vendetta levels, strengthening defenses, and allowing extra moves in a given turn. For \\"Story Mode,\\" the game switches to a 3D third-person perspective similar to that of the other versions, with the same lock-on system, and shooting and grappling mechanics. In \\"Mob Wars\\" mode, each turn has three phases; \\"Recruiting\\", \\"Negotiation\\", and \\"Intimidation\\". \\"Recruiting\\" allows the player to hire guards to protect already owned territory. \\"Negotiation\\" allows the player to select which cards they wish to use. \\"Intimidation\\" sees the player moving their units around the map, attempting to extort rival businesses. The player is free to play through \\"Story Mode\\" without playing \\"Mob Wars,\\" or to play \\"Mob Wars\\" as much as they wish between missions in \\"Story Mode.\\" Like in the other versions of the game, businesses taken over in \\"Mob Wars\\" yield money, which can be used to purchase better weaponry for use in \\"Story Mode\\". Like in the open world environment of the other versions of the game, to completely defeat a rival family, the player must destroy their compound. Also as in the other versions of the game, to finish the game to 100%, the player must complete all story missions in \\"Story Mode\\", and successfully extort all businesses, rackets, warehouses and hubs, and destroy all compounds in \\"Mob Wars\\" mode. Xbox 360 Originally announced on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360 version was named The Godfather. Initially scheduled for a March 2006 release, when the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC versions were pushed back from Fall 2005 to March 2006, the Xbox 360 and PSP versions were pushed back to September. Regarding the delay, executive producer David De Martini explained \\"The 360 version of the game will be released later this year, and we will be using the time between our March ship and the 360 version ship to take full advantage of the hardware with some key design modifications that will make the game rock on that platform.\\" The game was first shown at an EA press event on July 13, 2006. Designer Mike Olsen explained the 360 version \\"is 100% of the game on the Xbox, plus some.\\" Graphically, the game features dynamic weather and diurnal cycles, and an enhanced particle system. All of the rackets feature new textures and geographical layouts, so they no longer all look the same, and each of the rival family compounds is completely different, with bomb locations different from compound to compound. The game also features new lighting and particle effects. In terms of gameplay, the game adds a favor system whereby rather than intimidating shop owners, the player can carry out favors for them. The player can also carry out favors for family members, in much the same way as they can carry out hits. A major addition to the game is the ability for the player to hire Corleone soldiers to join Aldo in combat. This can involve individually hiring a single family member, or hiring a crew of four men who accompany the player everywhere until they are dismissed or killed. Individual crew members cost different amounts, but the more expensive they are, the better they fight. A full crew can only be hired periodically; when a meter on the HUD is full. The game also features new story missions, such as rescuing Tom Hagen from Sollozzo, bombing Sollozzo's drug factories, and assassinating Moe Greene. The aiming system has also been tweaked, and the melee combat system has had additional combat moves added. Twenty-six new execution styles have also been added to the twenty-two existing ones. In an interview with IGN, art manager Mark Lohff stated Creative director Michael Perry stated Wii Released in March 2007, the Wii version was originally announced on July 13, 2005. Nothing further was heard until January 10, 2006, when GameFly listed the game under the title The Godfather: Blackhand Edition. The following day, EA confirmed this title. They also announced the Wii version would feature all of the graphical and gameplay enhancements of the Xbox 360 version. New to the Wii edition would be an enhanced upgrade system which allowed the player to spend their upgrade points on more specific attributes. The game would allow for two upgrade paths - \\"Enforcer\\" and \\"Operator\\". Enforcer would concentrate on fighting and shooting skills, whilst Operator would feature monetary enhancements, intimidation aids and health upgrades. The Wii version would also feature an enhanced \\"BlackHand\\" control system making use of the Wii Remote's unique capabilities. In an interview with IGN, Joel Wade, producer of the Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, stated The Blackhand Edition uses both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy is on their knees, the player can pull the controllers upwards to lift them off the ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers from side to side swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to Wii Sports Boxing - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to throw in the game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder. PlayStation 3 Released on the same day in March 2007 as the Wii version, and developed alongside it, the PlayStation 3 version was the last version of the game announced, and was not revealed until January 10, 2007, when GameFly listed it under the title The Godfather: The Don's Edition. The following day, EA confirmed the game would be coming to PlayStation 3 under this title, with all the graphical and gameplay enhancements of both the Xbox 360 version and the Wii version (including the deeper upgrade system). In a statement, EA said the Don's Edition would \\"take full advantage\\" of the SIXAXIS controller's motion sensor, and would also feature added gameplay in the form of \\"The Corleone Expansion Pack.\\" The Don's Edition features a more basic form of the gesture- based BlackHand control scheme seen in the Wii version. The game uses the SIXAXIS' motion sensor functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller from side to side swings the enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in The Don's Edition, shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks. Unique to The Don's Edition are the \\"Corleone challenges\\". These are time based minigames that have no effect on the story. The player must see how much of a certain action they can accomplish in a given time - such as how many different execution styles they can perform, how many banks they can rob, or many businesses they can extort etc. When the game first came out, the player's scores were uploaded to an online leaderboard. EA shut down their servers for the game on April 13, 2012, meaning players can no longer upload their scores. However, the mini-games are still playable. Reception The Godfather received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all systems except the PlayStation Portable, which received \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" The Xbox version holds an aggregate scores of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on fifty-eight reviews; the Wii version 77 out of 100, based on thirty-eight reviews; the PlayStation 2 version 75 out of 100, based on fifty-six reviews; the Xbox 360 version 77 out of 100, based on fifty-one reviews; the PC version 72 out of 100, based on thirty-two reviews; the PlayStation 3 version 70 out of 100, based on thirty-one reviews; and the PlayStation Portable version 59 out of 100, based on thirty-four reviews. =PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox= GameSpot's Greg Mueller scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.1 out of 10, calling the game \\"a satisfying, lengthy adventure,\\" and arguing \\"it remains faithful to the classic film while managing to create a compelling story of its own [...] it handles the source material respectfully and manages to offer enough new content to feel like more than just a by-the-numbers adaptation of the movie.\\" IGN's Douglass C. Perry scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 7.9 out of 10, with the Xbox version finishing as runner-up in the March 2006 \\"Xbox Game of the Month\\" award, losing to Far Cry Instincts: Evolution. Perry praised the concept of placing a new character in the existing narrative; \\"Much of the story is carefully untarnished, so when you see pivotal scenes, they will be left relatively untouched. You'll hear and see these key scenes unfolding in front of you, but you'll be in the house, the car, the church, or the hospital as a close associate, rather than a bystander. You'll feel like an insider who's part of a great powerful narrative, and the feeling is eerily remarkable.\\" Although he was critical of the melee combat and the driving portions of the game, he called the extortion system \\"awesome fun.\\" He concluded, \\"people looking for a perfect game will be disappointed [but] there are elements that totally stand out from any similar games in this genre, from the extortion system to the business take-over model. Despite obvious areas in need of improvement, I had a blast playing The Godfather.\\" GameSpy's Will Tuttle scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3.5 out of 5. Praising the use of the license, he wrote \\"the game is best viewed as a complementary addition to the Godfather universe,\\" calling it \\"an ultimately entertaining sandbox game that doesn't really do much to help or hurt the license.\\" Game Informers Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing \\"while failing to transform the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't have to rely on the film license to pull it along.\\" GameSpy's William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; \\"where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is all about the violence.\\" He wrote \\"Being a Godfather game, you'd expect things to be a bit less \\"insane\\" than your run-of-the-mill Grand Theft Auto clone. But there's more gunplay, more Blues Brothers-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy.\\" He concluded \\"if you can think of it as a generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, you can certainly have a good time. That said, it's hard to play The Godfather without thinking that this was a missed opportunity.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it \\"way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of Grand Theft Auto to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering.\\" Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; \\"the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition.\\" He argued the game \\"offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening.\\" =PlayStation Portable= IGN's Chris Roper scored Mob Wars 6.2 out of 10, writing \\"there are a number of areas where the ball was dropped.\\" He was mildly impressed with the card gameplay, but felt it wasn't enough to \\"help the game rise above mediocrity.\\" He called the game \\"an interesting idea, but it doesn't feel cohesive enough or like either part was pushed as far as it could go.\\" GameSpot's Greg Mueller scored it 6 out of 10. He too was more impressed with Mob Wars mode than Story Mode, writing \\"it sounds like the makings of an experiment gone awry, like some sort of Frankenstein's monster of game design, but it's actually playable--and even fun.\\" However, he called the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars \\"tenuous and disjointed.\\" He concluded \\"Mob Wars doesn't live up to its potential. There are some flashes of a good game in there, and you might have fun for the first couple of hours, but unfortunately that enjoyment is fleeting, and you'll be left feeling aggravated and disappointed.\\" GameSpy's Justin Speer scored it 3 out of 5. He too was critical of the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars, and concluded \\"it can't hold itself together well enough to deliver a really satisfying game experience.\\" Game Informers Andrew Reiner scored it 4.5 out of 10, stating \\"Electronic Arts couldn't quite get The Godfather to run correctly on the PSP, but that didn't stop them from releasing it. Applying cement shoes to the experience, [EA have] stripped all of the open world gameplay from this version, leaving nothing but the lame missions and a putrid Risk-like minigame.\\" =Xbox 360= GameSpy's David Chapman scored the Xbox 360 version 4 out of 5, calling it \\"definitely the version to pick up.\\" GameSpot's Greg Mueller scored it 7.9 out of 10, writing \\"for the most part, this is the same game that was released six months earlier.\\" IGN's Douglass C. Perry also scored it 7.9 out of 10, calling it \\"essentially the same game with minor visual and gameplay upgrades. If you played the current-gen version, this plays exactly the same, but every so often you'll see or experience a surprising little tweak.\\" He concluded \\"EA upgraded a bunch of little things and improved the overall experience. But gamers have higher expectations for next-generation titles, and The Godfather looks and plays exactly like what it is: a good upgraded current-gen game.\\" Game Informers Matt Helgeson scored it 7.75 out of 10, calling it \\"still the same flawed game that was released for the current-gen systems.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 6 out of 10, writing \\"the changes and improvements are so minor that you might not have noticed them were they not written down for you. Tellingly, none of them really address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place.\\" He was critical of the graphics, arguing \\"the game looks like a port from the word go. The low-poly character models, stilted animation and bland texture detail of the original is exposed even more once you see it running in high def.\\" He concluded \\"the core of The Godfather can be quite harmlessly entertaining. Like so many openworld games, there's a moreishness to it that keeps you going even when so many alarm bells are ringing about where EA went wrong. But let's face it, The Godfather should have been far better than it is.\\" =Wii and PlayStation 3= IGN's Mark Bozon scored the Wii version 8 out of 10. It would go on to win the March 2007 \\"Wii Game of the Month\\" award. Bozon wrote \\"it incorporates a ton of great actions with the Wii controller, is one of the better looking games on the system, and actually banks on the system's strong points.\\" Of the controls, he wrote \\"after playing it on Wii I really can't see people wanting to go back to the traditional controls.\\" Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter scored it 7 out of 10, writing \\"While most of the gameplay flaws inherent in the previous versions are still there in this new version, there are a number of factors that may make this far more appealing to the average Wii owner [...] this is generally a decent, well-thought out and enjoyable conversion.\\" Game Informers Andrew Reiner scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing \\"the redeveloped skill tree is a step in the right direction, but the sloppy motion-based combat and IR targeting make the game even more painful than it was on the other machines.\\" IGN's Chris Roper scored the PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it \\"certainly the best version of the bunch.\\" Of the controls, he wrote \\"it doesn't feel as rewarding or \\"realistic\\" as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does.\\" He was also critical of the graphics; \\"its visuals are simply poor for a next- generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen and it really does look like you're playing a PS2 game in HD.\\" He concluded \\"the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA has done a great job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [but] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect.\\" Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing \\"it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same.\\" He concluded \\"The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience.\\" Greg Mueller from GameSpot scored both versions 7.6 out of 10. Of the controls, he wrote \\"at times the movements don't seem to register properly unless you use exaggerated gestures.\\" GameSpy's Patrick Joynt scored the PlayStation 3 version 3 out of 5 and the Wii version 3.5 out of 5, and was critical of the game's use of its license; \\"Sickening bloodlust and a fondness for repetition are essential skills for enjoying The Godfather, placing an otherwise decent open-world game at direct odds with its own license and identity.\\" However, he also felt that \\"once you get over the disconnect of the license and the gameplay, the missions are plentiful and entertaining.\\" He concluded \\"a licensed game doesn't need to be slavishly adhered to the property it's coming from. And the actual gameplay here isn't half-bad. But like slapping the word \\"art\\" on a toilet, there's a constant dissonance between the license and the gameplay.\\" =Sales and awards= The Godfather sold well across all platforms. In the first week of the game's North American release, the PlayStation 2 version was Blockbuster's top rental title, with the Xbox version coming in second. Together, the two titles rented more copies than the rest of the top ten combined. During its first three months on release, the game sold over one million units across PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC. In the game's first week on release in the UK, it entered the charts at #1, knocking The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion from the top spot. It remained in the top ten chart for eight weeks. At the 2006 Spike Video Game Awards, the game received three nominations; \\"Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show\\", \\"Best Supporting Male Performance\\" (James Caan as Sonny Corleone) and \\"Best Cast\\". It lost in the first category to Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, Caan lost to James Gandolfini for The Sopranos: Road to Respect, and \\"Best Cast\\" went to Family Guy Video Game! At the 2007 Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) Awards, composers Ashley Irwin and Bill Conti won the award for \\"Best Arrangement of a Non-Original Score.\\" Notes References Category:2006 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Open world video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games about revenge Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games based on adaptations Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Video games set in the 1930s Category:Video games set in the 1940s Category:Video games set in the 1950s Category:Visceral Games Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Works based on The Godfather Category:Video games set in 1936 Category:Video games set in 1945 Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"The Godfather (2006 video game)"},{"id":"2174349","text":"Shauraseni Prakrit (, ) was a Middle Indo-Aryan language and a Dramatic Prakrit.

The town had 60,091 inhabitants in 2012. It is the capital of the Nyong-et-So'o Department. It is located at the banks of the Nyong river between Ebolowa and Yaound√©. It is an agricultural centre and has an important function as a centre of education. Site of the Mbalmayo National Forestry School.Lukong Pius Nyuylime, \\"Cameroon: New Training Programme for Mbalmayo Forestry School,\\" allAfrica.com, November 7, 2006. Accessed: January 16, 2013.  History Mbalmayo had existed since 1910 during the German rule of the then Kamerun. Mbalmayo was founded by Mbala Meyo, one of the first ruler of the town. As was the custom of chiefs who rule large communities prior to colonialism, villages and town were named after the chief. This trend of events could be seen in the other neighboring town and villages such as Akonolinga, Nanga Ebogo and Abong Bang, just to name a few. The Germans had administrative control over the town and made use of the Nyong river for transportation of timber which was a major source of income. Due to its economic potentials, the Germans before the First World War had intended to establish an administrative headquarters in Mbalmayo. Also partly because they found a rock in the Nyong river with a protruded rounded wait which was attractive especially for touristic activities. However, immediately after the first world war in 1919, when Germany had to cede power to the Allied Forces, the project was never realized. The Town was handed to the French as French protectorate by the United Nations.  Economy Mbalmayo forestry school Mbalmayo is an industrial town that is about 41 km from Yaound√© the Capital of Cameroon. Mbalmayo is located in the Central Province of Cameroon. It is situated along the Nyong River, south of Yaound√©. Since it is deeply entrenched in the dense equatorial forest zone that stretched to the South, its natural physical environmental features makes it strategically economical located. The main economic activities are forestry and agriculture. There is a plywood factory powered by electricity from the Edea Hydroelectric Power Station. It is also a commercial centre due to its position at the junction of three transportation routes: it lies on the main road south from Yaound√©; it is the terminus of the Camrail railway from Douala; and serves as a river port on the Nyong River, which is seasonally navigable for from Mbalmayo east to Abong Mbang. In order to improve and to increase its economic activities, the Government of Cameroon in 1989, through partnership with the African Development Bank was able to construct a 101 km road that links Mbalmayo with Ebolowa, the capital of the South Province.Mapping Mbalmayo Forest Amongst its economic activities, Timber exploration is a major source of revenue for Mbalmayo and Cameroon in general. There is the Mbalmayo's forest reserve which is one of Cameroon's oldest forest reserve. Other cash crops include palm oil, palm kernel oil, coffee and cocoa.  Politics Cameroon is divided administratively into ten provinces now referred to as regions. Administration of these provinces are based on the political party in power. Mbalmayo is politically and administratively managed under the Central province/region. It is a sub-division of the Nyong-et-So'o Division of the Central Province.People Managing Forests: The Links Between Human Well-Being and Sustainability The administration of the division and the subdivisions is directly under the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization. Mbalmayo is the administrative headquarters of the Nyong et So'o division. Since independence, this division has been headed by two political parties- The CNU and the CPDM. However, ironically, these two parties were just the same party that underwent a name change. In 1985, CNU was changed to CPDM-Cameroon People Democratic Movement under the leadership of Paul Biya. Since 1968, there have been 6 Mayors elected in Mbalmayo. The longest-serving mayor was AMOUGOU MBIDA Samuel, who served as Mayor of the city Council for 17 years. He was also the Mayor in place during the political transition from Amadou Ahidjo to Paul Biya, and from the CNU to the CPDM.

Generally, most towns and villages in Cameroon are not easily accessible due to the poor road and transport network. Mbalmayo is, however, accessible by asphalt roads from Yaounde. By train it is the southern terminus of the railroad from Douala. The river Nyong is also commonly used as a mean of transport by locals and fishermen. The river runs for 250 km from Mbalmayo to the east of Abong-Mbang. Understanding the role of transport in economic development, the Government of Cameroon in 1987, secured a loan worth UA 47.15 million from the African Development Bank to finance the construction of a dual carriage way between Mbalmayo and Ebolowa in the south. The project was completed in 1991 by the firms COGEFAR Cameroon and Razel-Bec and works were supervised by BCEOM Cameroon and LABOGENIE. The project covered over 100 km of paved road.CAMEROON MBALMAYO-EBOLOWA ROAD PROJECT Project Performance Evaluation Report (PPER) The project has contributed significantly to opening up of the southern province and made possible the development of agriculture and forest production in the project area. Since timber harvesting is the biggest contributor to the economy of the southern province, transportation of both humans and goods have been made easy. \\"Thanks to the improvement of travelling conditions and the lowering of transport costs, women play a more important role in production and in the associative life of the region. Trade, particularly in food commodities between Cameroon and her neighbours has intensified since the commissioning of the road. Nevertheless, the road‚Äôs contribution to increased regional integration will be significant only when the entire Yaound√©- Libreville route, which has several sections in poor condition, has been developed.\\"African Development Bank Group 1997 Notable people *J√©r√¥me Ongu√©n√© (born 1997), association football player  Maps  * Map  Statistics  * Elevation = 335m * Population = 292,000  References  * Catholic-hierarchy.org *Owana Ndongo Pierre et al., (2008).Mapping Mbalmayo Forest. *Robert John Raison, Alan Gordon Brown, David W.

Curtis Mayfield served as the composer and producer of Sparkles songs and score. The film received generally negative reviews at the time of release and was a box office disappointment, making only $4 million against a $1 million budget. It has since developed a cult following. The film was remade in 2012 starring Jordin Sparks, Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, and Whitney Houston in her final film role. Plot synopsis The movie is a rags to riches story. It begins in Harlem, New York, in 1958, and follows the girl group, Sister and the Sisters, which is made up of three sisters: Sister, Sparkle, and Delores. Stix, Sparkle's love interest and the group's manager, is able to help bring the group from \\"amateur nights to brief stardom before tragedy (dope, melancholia, the wrong man)\\" ensues and the group splits. Stix gives up on his music career and leaves the city and thus breaking Sparkle's heart. Sister is in an abusive relationship and is hung up on drugs while Delores leaves the city in pursuit of racial equality. In the end, after reconnecting after Sister's funeral, it is only Sparkle and Stix who climb the ladder to success. Cast Production =Development= Lonne Elder, writer of the Academy Award nominated screenplay for Sounder drafted Sparkle, which Joel Schumacher edited to make a 200-page basis for the film that became his screenwriting debut. John Calley was running Warner Bros. at the time and said Sam O'Steen had to direct the film. He was the famous editor of Carnal Knowledge, Rosemary's Baby, and Chinatown. This film was Sam O'Steen's debut film as a film director and given the limited budget, he did his best to use what was available to him. The film's story and plot were heavily inspired by the real-life singing group Diana Ross and the Supremes. =Casting= The film mainly introduced newer faces, which kept the budget low. Over 2,000 women auditioned for the role of Sparkle; in the end Irene Cara was cast, at age 17. She became the film's breakout star and went on to act in films such as Fame. With her other cast mates, the trio \\"combine their extraordinary freshness and talent to sing to the music of Curtis Mayfield, who composed the music for the film produced by Howard Rosenman.\\" None of the actors cast were well known at the time and many were newcomers. Lonette McKee actually made her feature film debut in this film. =Filming= Bruce Surtees was the cinematographer. Lester Wilson choreographed the movie, and his assistant was Michael Peters, who went on to choreograph ‚ÄúBeat It‚Äù and ‚ÄúThriller‚Äù for Michael Jackson. Themes =Music= During the 1960s and 1970s, music paralleled black identity and culture. The early 1960s consisted of freedom music, a direct descendant of gospel music. This genre was aimed at building strong relationships during difficult times by connecting people. Sam Cooke and Freedom Singers are an example of these artists. The late 1960s to early 1970s consisted of soul music which tied in with historical macro events such as: Middle Civil Rights Movement, Great Society, Vietnam War, and Black Power. Soul music encourages everyone to be happy. Some influential artists during this time were James Brown, The Supremes, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. Next, the mid 1970s consisted of funk music. These songs were political and group focused. Some of these artists include Earth Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone, Parliament Funkadelic, Kool & The Gang, Labelle, and Chaka Khan. Finally, the middle to late 1970s consisted of disco which was essentially peppy dance music. Stand out artists include Gloria Gaynor, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, and Donna Summer. Within these genres, there are themes of self-determination, racial pride, and having fun. Sparkle captured all these themes as it spans musical genres. All the songs were adapted to the sound of the times, making the film relevant and powerful. Aretha Franklin had a large role with the music that was featured in the film. She even has an entire album called \\"Sparkle.\\" The other songs in the film were written by Curtis Mayfield. The songs were a huge hit. =Gender and sexuality= While analyzing gender and sexuality, the Black female protagonists in this film can easily be compared to the women in Cleopatra Jones and Coffy. Unlike these films, Sparkle‚Äôs protagonists do not come out on top in the same way as Cleo and Coffy do. Compared to Coffy and Cleo, these women are much more conservative in their looks and the way they convey themselves. Regarding female empowerment, their physical appearance is the only attribute they have and they use it as a tool. In other words, it is their only weapon. Coffy and Cleo both had actual guys and weapons at their disposal to use along with their physical appearance. Going off of this, the sisters are much weaker when looking at female empowerment, especially when there is Coffy and Cleo in the picture. It is interesting how in Jacquie Jones' essay, Construction of Black Sexuality, ‚Äúthe Black male character, as defined through his sexual behavior, is not able to overcome the problematic of domination which begins with a denial of dependency. Instead, the Black male character can only define himself through violent separateness‚Äù (250). One very disturbing scene in the film was when Sister and her boyfriend Satin are lying together on a bed. To get a coat, Satin tells sister she has to crawl. Sister does not think he is serious, so he angrily says it again. Satin then begins to brutally punch Sister. When Sister goes to her next performance, her other sisters realize that she has been beaten by Satin. They encourage her to leave him but she just brushes off the violence as it is no big deal; she believes she can just cover up the bruises with makeup and it will be better. Darlene Clark Hine's A Shining Thread of Hope brought up the fact that after women joined the Black Power movements, men felt lesser of themselves as they could not protect and support their families. Hine states that ‚ÄúThe Black Power movement reacted to this reality with an extreme emphasis on masculinity and an expectation that women would assume traditional female roles as a way of supporting black manhood. And yet, women in these organizations actually managed to make greater progress in some ways than they had in more traditional civil rights groups‚Äù (298). The reading also addresses 1976 as a time when things started to change in regards to sexual harassment being a crime. This all relates to black women and their position of power. ‚ÄúThe terrible reality of their oppression by men of their own color [‚Ä¶] was personal and political dynamite‚Äù (302). Bringing this all together, Satin might have felt dominated by Sister and her success/potential success. It is unfortunate that Sister decides to brush it off but this goes with how she did not want to ‚Äúlight the fuse‚Äù of oppression by black men on black women. \\"Blaxploitation films are notable for the ways they frequently situate \\"normative\\" black male identity amongst a variety of ideological \\"others\\" (women, homosexuals, other ethnicities) whose presence cannot simply be seen to solidify black manhood.\\" =Black Power / blaxploitation= The 1970s and the Women's Movement provide context for Black films like Sparkle. During this time, Title IX was instated and provided scholarships for female college athletes. In addition, the Equal Rights Amendment of 1972 was a victory for women's suffrage that helped build a dialogue for black women and black women in films. Drugs, the Mafia, self-determination, and the ghetto are all apparent themes in Sparkle. Black Power in Sparkle is interesting in that there are no positive black male figures in the film. Every man is using women for things like sex, success, and their own selfish reasons. At one point, Jones even addresses black male sexuality and how they assume the role of a white man to achieve power over women. Going off of this, whites in this film are on the periphery and the focus is on the inner struggle between blacks. An example of this is the relationship between Sister and her boyfriend. Satin is an abusive man towards Sister who is involved with drugs and the Mafia. He is the source for all of Sisters' struggles as he pushes her into doing drugs and making her feel helpless as he beats her time and time again. Delores is an example of self-determination as she sees her sister Sister struggling, which makes her realize that she needs to leave town and do things for herself. She is strong and independent enough to pick everything up and leave town, striving for a decent future. According to the Senior Vice President of Programming for IFC and Bravo, Frances Berwick, \\"Blaxploitation films were some of the most experimental and daring films to come out of both the independent film scene and the studio system, [and] is one of the most ignored and under-appreciated.\\" Blaxploitation includes several sub-types, musical being one of them, and where Sparkle fits in. Reception =Box office= Sparkle was domestically released on April 7, 1976 with a running time of 98 minutes. The film was unsuccessful at the box office grossing merely $4 million against a $1 million production budget. =Critical reception= The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, currently holding a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019541_sparkle? Variety stated that \\"somewhere along the line, there was made a decision to cheat‚Äîto attempt an honest ghetto drama, but not enough to really go all the way into the characters; to keep the exploitative elements of casual dope and sex, but jump ahead to the convenient tragic results which can be seen on any TV feature; to explore the seedier side of the music business, but not enough to ever get beyond the titillations of pulp storytelling.\\" Richard Eder said the film was a predictable sob story but that the main themes of the story are serious enough and credible. Dave Kehr stated that the film was \\"[a] hackneyed, ho-hum 1976 feature about a black girl group, clearly modeled on the Supremes.\\" FilmFour stated that \\"[as] drab as it is, Sparkles worth renting for Lonette McKee's performance and the cast renditions of Mayfield's songs. But if you're going to buy anything it should be the soundtrack album.\\" However, The Onion's AV Club gave it a B- grade, calling it \\"a rags-to-riches story that doesn't miss a stop along the well-trod ghetto-to-musical-charts path, but makes its journey with tuneful conviction.\\" Legacy Of the people who appeared in the movie, Irene Cara became the film's breakout star: she went on to record many chart-topping singles. Lonette McKee went on to other TV and film appearances with Richard Pryor, including playing Denzel Washington's on-screen mother in Malcolm X, and Dorian Harewood and Philip Michael Thomas did more TV and film appearances. Thomas would be famous as Ricardo Tubbs on the TV show Miami Vice. Sparkle was previewed by an appreciative audience in Baltimore in March. The crowd of 1300 is said to have applauded, screamed and displayed loud attestation to their feelings that it was a good movie. It was viewed as a rather atypical Blaxploitation film for the day, illustrating \\"that based on the nature, dignity, interests and ideals of man even blacks from the ghetto are capable of self-fulfillment and ehtical conduct without recourse to supernaturalism; in this case the super-stud, super-chick theory that is so common in the movies made primarily for the black movie goers today.\\" Sparkle went on to become a cult classic among African-American audiences, and was remade in 2012 as a TriStar Pictures release starring Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston. Directed by Salim and Mara Brock Akil and produced by Stage 6 Films, the film, despite once again receiving mixed to negative reviews, was considered by some to be an improvement over the original. Sparks, Houston, and Mike Epps were all praised individually for their performances. The remake also brought new different aspects to the story which were said to have enhanced the drama of the film. For example, the evil Satin, played by Epps, was turned into a comedian instead of a gangster. Ultimately, the writing and performances were considered captivating and multidimensional. In regards to the music, R. Kelly wrote several new songs which were used alongside the songs composed in the original film by Curtis Mayfield. This film was released later than anticipated, due to the sudden death of Houston. Some have considered the film to have been a huge comeback for Houston in the industry, albeit one achieved posthumously. Irene Cara had met Houston a couple of times. She said, \\"I remember seeing her mother, Cissy, when I was little, [...] I remember seeing her sing in New York. They were doing a tribute to Burt Bacharach. When Whitney came on to the scene, every time I saw her I saw a little bit of her mother in her.\\" Cara expressed a desire to attend the premiere of the film, but was not able due to a recent foot surgery.

The company was founded as Parallax Software in June 1993 by Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, and developed Descent and Descent II. The company split in two, wherein Toschlog founded Outrage Entertainment, while Kulas stayed with Parallax, which was renamed Volition in November 1996. Volition was acquired by THQ in August 2000, and when THQ filed for bankruptcy and had its assets sold off, Volition changed hands to Deep Silver in January 2013. Volition is best known for its Red Faction and Saints Row series of games.  History  = Parallax Software and Descent (1993‚Äì1996) = Parallax Software logo (1993‚Äì1996) Parallax Software was founded on June 14, 1993, by Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog. The company was incorporated under the name Parallax Software Corporation. Both founders were programmers who had previously worked together on Car and Driver. This led them to consider launching their own game development company, knowing that, should they fail, they would have to return to working for other's companies. To reach a lower cost-of-living, Toschlog moved from Boston to Champaign, Illinois, where Kulas resided, and the two launched Parallax Software. Early on, they hired programmers John Slagel and Che-Yuan Wang, of which Wang also worked on level design. The team developed a rough concept for a game called Inferno, which they pitched to Apogee Software, the primary publisher of id Software. Apogee began funding the game's development, though the funds did not suffice for the company over time. Because the team lacked an artist, Adam Pletcher was hired in January 1994. Shortly thereafter, Apogee dropped the project after it had been in development for seven months, though leaving Parallax with an already funded, functional prototype. Subsequently, while the studio was slowly running out of money, they produced a demo reel of the game and set it as a VHS tape to various publishers. Three companies‚ÄîAccolade, Trimark Interactive and Interplay Productions (where it was championed by Rusty Buchert)‚Äîoffered to publish the game, of which Parallax chose Interplay. Jasen Whiteside then became Parallax eighth employee, working on level design while studying industrial design at school. With the studio lacking a quality assurance department, the game was tested by the entire team. As Interplay's funds had also dried up, Parallax refused to ask them for more, not wanting to show signs of weakness. Instead, Kulas and Toschlog invested their own money into the continued development. Funds provided by Apogee, Interplay and the two founders totaled to about . Inferno, now titled Descent, was released in March 1995 to widespread attention. By the time Parallax began development on another Descent game, the team had grown to about 14 people. Interplay wished for the studio to develop a \\"CD-enhanced\\" version of the game, which would include high-resolution textures, cutscenes and Red Book-quality audio, as well as several new levels. Interplay marketed the game as a new game, Descent II, so they could make more profit than they would have from a simple derivate version of the same game, and could publish a new game under the same contract they had with Parallax. As a result, Parallax profited heavily from Descent II success. = Creation of Volition (1996‚Äì1997) = Jasen Whiteside's original Volition logo, using the font created by Adam Pletcher Although Toschlog had moved to Champaign from Boston, he did not want to stay in Champaign long- term. During the development of Descent II, he and three designers moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to open a second office for Parallax. At the new office, Toschlog also hired two further programmers. After Descent II had shipped, the team came to the conclusion that working on the same game out of two distant offices had adverse effects on the team, where Toschlog and Kulas agreed to move the company to one office. However, they could not decide on where they should move the company, so they instead opted to split the company in half, a move they were able to pursue due to Descent success. Thus, half of Parallax' employees followed Toschlog to Michigan, where Toschlog formed Outrage Entertainment, while Kulas stayed with the main Parallax office in Champaign. As Kulas' company was to receive a new name, he asked the remaining team for ideas. When he found that he liked none of the proposals, he sat down in his living room, pulling books from a shelf and looking through dictionaries and reference books' glossaries for a possible name. In one such glossary, he found the word \\"\\", described as \\"an intense active will to accomplish something\\". As he drew a connection between this definition and the act of software development, he chose \\"Volition\\" to be the new company name. He pitched the name and its definition to the company's employees, asking them to create a suitable logo. Of the many entries submitted, the one that was chosen was designed by Whiteside and inspired by the logo of Wax Trax! Records, while Pletcher created a font to display the company name with. The logo has been in use since. Formally, Volition was founded in October 1996 with twelve members, and the split was announced on December 1, 1997, with both companies having been organized into new corporate entities (wherein Volition was Volition, Inc.) and wholly owned by their respective leads. = FreeSpace and Summoner, THQ acquisition (1997‚Äì2000) = Following the split, Volition and Outrage signed with Interplay for two further projects each. Their first project under the new name was Descent: FreeSpace ‚Äì The Great War (or simply FreeSpace), a game that was set to improve on the concepts of games like Star Wars: X-Wing and Star Wars: TIE Fighter. During the development of FreeSpace, the Volition team doubled in size, adding about five or six people to the studio. During this time many team members were allocated to training the new employees. Meanwhile, Kulas, as the sole manager of the company, had to divide his time between programming and managing the business; consequently, should any business matter come up, his portion of the programming work stood still. FreeSpace was the last Volition game Kulas would significantly do programming work on. Following the release of FreeSpace, Volition began work on four projects‚ÄîFreeSpace 2, Descent 4, Tube Racer and Summoner. The first, FreeSpace 2, was developed within a year. When the game's development had about three months to go, Interplay, who had recently become a public company, urged Volition to complete the game within a month. While the game was completed within the month, Interplay did not adjust their advertisement strategy. As a result, the game sold poorly and was only marginally profitable. Tube Racers was canceled about six to nine months in development. Descent 4 was to be the fourth main entry in the Descent series (the third game, Descent 3, was in development simultaneously at Outrage). As the Descent 3 release date came closer, Interplay began having financial difficulties. When the game launched in June 1999, it also did not sell well. The two companies separated on Volition's suggestion. Interplay owned the publishing rights to the Descent franchise, and as a result Volition could not publish Descent 4 with a different publisher. Instead, they reused much of the code and tools they had created for the game and used it to create Red Faction. Summoner, unlike other games by Parallax and Volition, was developed as a role-playing video game, a genre the development team had no experience with. The team were later provided with a development kit for the PlayStation 2, and were tasked with making Summoner a launch title for the console. Meanwhile, the four-game deal with Interplay was winding down, and Volition required a new publisher for Summoner. On August 31, 2000, they were acquired by THQ, who also overtook the game's publishing duties. In exchange for the ownership of Volition, Volition received one million shares of THQ's common stock and THQ assumed about in net liabilities for Volition's operations. THQ also acquired Outrage in April 2002, though closed that studio by 2004. Following a troubled development cycle, Summoner eventually hit the intended release date in October 2000, but shipped in a flawed state that resulted from the technical discrepancies between personal computers and PlayStation 2, between which the studio had to port the game. = Red Faction, Summoner II and The Punisher (2000‚Äì2005) = After Volition had started to develop Red Faction out of what had been Descent 4, many people on the team felt like the game was a \\"ground-pounder\\", a game they would work hard on just to get an unpleasant result. The game shifted from a space combat game to a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on environmental destruction. Much like Summoner, Red Faction was first developed for personal computers before moving to consoles. When Kulas attempted to write a part of the game's code, he found himself writing code for personal computers, having to rewrite everything should it work on consoles. The game was delayed for two months shortly before release to allow the team to polish the game before it shipped. The game went gold shortly thereafter, and received positive reviews, much to the surprise of the development team. Following Red Faction, Volition developed Summoner II, aiming at fixing all flaws made in the first game. While it was received better than the first game, it also sold fewer copies. After that came Red Faction II, which was ultimately not reviewed as good as the first game, again to the team's surprise. Internally, Red Faction II was considered a failure, and the series was halted. Ports of the game, released in 2003, were developed by fellow THQ studios Outrage (Microsoft Windows, Xbox) and Cranky Pants Games (GameCube). A third Red Faction game was already in development, but was consequently canceled. A third Summoner game was also canceled. Following these cancellations, their teams started development on a heist-style game called Underground. The team worked on the game for about twelve months, but when Grand Theft Auto III was released, the marketing department at THQ pushed the expectations for the game so high that they could not be met, wherefore Underground, too, was canceled. Following Underground cancellation, THQ approached Volition and asked them whether they were willing to create a licensed game. The publisher suggested that they would create a game around Marvel Comics character Punisher, who had a movie coming up, which the studio agreed to. The development team had excursed to Marvel's film studios and were on set, talking to stage designers and witnessing some of the scenes being shot. Meanwhile, in 2003, as the studio grew to 30‚Äì40 employees, Kulas hired Dan Cermak as vice-president for the company, who then implemented a new company structure to replace its previous flat hierarchy. As the game neared completion, it was submitted to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), which, as the game re-enacted the Punisher's violent interrogation methods, deemed the game to be more of a torture simulator than a game. Some elements were adjusted so that the game could pass the ESRB with a \\"Mature\\" rating. = Saints Row (2006‚Äì2008) = At one point, Volition held a design exercise, inviting staff members to submit ideas for a new game. One such idea was a hybrid between a first-person shooter and a \\"gang simulator\\", a genre unexplored by most games at the time. A trailer was put together by taking snippets from various movies and games, underlaid with the song \\"Fuck tha Police\\", and after it was showcased in their board room, THQ's chief financial officer stepped forward, stating that this would be a game they were willing to develop. Volition imposed several rules on the game, such as the exclusion of children and the inability to kill the police, so to not generate too much controversy. The team shifted away from developing in wide arrays of genres, instead focusing the entire studio's talent on one design principle: open world. The game, initially known as Bling Bling, was disliked by many of Volition's employees who either did not want to be associated with gang simulator or thought that their work on the game was not worthwhile. The studio faced further trouble as they switched from the PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360, because the documentation provided with the Xbox 360 was incomplete, and the final hardware specifications for it unknown. During the game's development, the studio overspent its budget of and brought up its headcount to over 100. After the game, now titled Saints Row, was finished, the team was asked to write postmortem documentations, which presented a lot of negative views on the game, as well as criticism with the management. When the game was released and sold well, it was decided that Volition would develop another such game, which would become Saints Row 2. Saints Row 2 differed from its predecessor in that it was more sandbox-oriented and more infused with humor, which the first game almost completely lacked. = Return to Red Faction, Saints Row: The Third and Insane (2009‚Äì2012) = Kulas had wished to return to developing a game centered around destruction, either through Red Faction or through a new intellectual property, now that console hardware had been advanced enough to handle such gameplay. Thus, the studio decided to develop a new Red Faction game, Red Faction: Guerrilla. From the poor reception of Red Faction II, the team had learned that destruction-based gameplay was not a good fit for a shooter set in narrow, enclosed corridors, wherefore the team opted for an open world instead. The game's development cycle lasted roughly five years. While Guerrilla was set on Mars, the next installment in the franchise, Red Faction: Armageddon, went in the other direction by being set inside a cave. A third game in the Saints Row franchise, Saints Row 3, was announced in February 2009. The game stripped away many features included in its predecessor to make for a more focused but overall still \\"over-the-top\\" experience. Under the name Saints Row: The Third, the game was released in November 2011. In December 2010, at that year's Spike Video Game Awards, film director Guillermo del Toro took the stage to announce Insane, a horror game developed in partnership with Volition, projecting a 2013 release date. del Toro later revealed that Insane would become a trilogy, with total development time spanning one decade. However, in August 2012, THQ announced that Insane had been canceled. In April 2011, it was announced that Kulas was retiring from the company, effective on May 2, with Cermak taking over his position as general manager. Following his retirement, he \\"goofed off\\" for about four years before he got back together with Toschlog, founding a new studio, Revival Productions, in 2014. The new company went to develop a spiritual successor to Descent named Overload, which was funded through a crowdfunding campaign held on Kickstarter and released in May 2018. = Acquisition by Deep Silver (2013) = In December 2012, THQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As the publisher's assets were to be sold off, Koch Media offered a bid for Volition. While a total of six groups‚ÄîWarner Bros., Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft, Koch Media, and an unnamed group from Chicago‚Äîwere interested in purchasing the studio, the only other bid submitted was Ubisoft's for . As the sale closed, Volition and the Saints Row IP were sold to Koch Media for a total of , and became part of its Deep Silver division. As a result, Volition's operations were transitioned into a new legal entity, named Deep Silver Volition, LLC. Several IPs owned by THQ, including Volition's Summoner and Red Faction, were acquired by Nordic Games (later known as THQ Nordic) for in a second auction held in April. With the purchase of Koch Media by the parent company of Nordic Games (then renamed THQ Nordic) in February 2018, Volition and their IPs were reunited under one company. = Saints Row IV and Agents of Mayhem, layoffs (2013‚Äìpresent) = A fourth Saints Row game, Saints Row IV, was released in August 2013. In September 2014, creative director Steve Jaros left Volition to join Valve. An expansion to Saints Row IV, titled Saints Row: Gat out of Hell and developed in partnership with High Voltage Software, was released in January 2015. Following Saints Row IV, Volition developed Agents of Mayhem, a game set in the Saints Row universe, featuring similar gameplay mechanics while being unconnected to the main series. The game released in August 2017 to mixed reviews and poor sales. As a result, about 30 positions, including Cermak, were cut from the studio's previously 200-people-strong workforce. Jim Boone, who had been part of Parallax in 1994, succeeded Cermak as studio development director in October. On December 31, Volition's staff count was 148. In January 2019, Kulas announced his return to Volition as general manager. At the time, Revival Productions was winding down, and when Kulas wondered what to do next, fearing he would end up not doing anything for four years, he decided to re-join the studio after eight years. According to Kulas, his time as an indie developer at Revival helped him \\"come up to speed on all kinds of stuff\\". By August 2019, Volition is \\"deep in development\\" on a new installment in the Saints Row franchise. At this time, it had 174 employees, and has close to 200 as of February 2020. In May 2020, Koch Media and THQ Nordic, by this time both part of Embracer Group, exchanged some intellectual property rights, including Red Faction, which was handed to Deep Silver.

Morus papyrifera L.) is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Asia,Broussonetia papyrifera. Flora of North America. where its range includes Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, Indochina, Burma, and India. It is widely cultivated elsewhere and it grows as an introduced species in parts of Europe, the United States, and Africa. Other common names include tapa cloth tree. Origin Paper mulberry was used among ancient Austronesians in making barkcloth. It originates from subtropical regions in mainland Asia and is one of the best examples for the mainstream \\"Out of Taiwan\\" hypothesis of the Austronesian expansion. Various genetic studies have traced the origins of paper mulberry populations in the Remote Pacific all the way to Taiwan via New Guinea and Sulawesi. In the Philippines, which was along the expansion path, paper mulberries are mostly descendants of modern introductions in 1935. Ancient introductions of paper mulberry presumably went extinct in prehistory due to their replacement with hand-woven fabrics, given that paper mulberry generally only survives under human cultivation. However, its absence in the Philippines further underlines its origins in Taiwan, and not within island Southeast Asia. Additionally, paper mulberry populations in New Guinea also show genetic inflow from another expansion out of Indochina and South China. It is believed to be the most widely transported fiber crop in prehistory, having been transported along with the full range of the Austronesian expansion, as opposed to most of the other commensal crops in Oceania. Paper mulberry is present in almost every island or island group in Polynesia, including Rapa Nui and Aotearoa. Some populations have gone recently extinct after they stopped being cultivated, such as in the Cook Islands and Mangareva, although accounts and prepared barkcloth and herbarium specimens of them exist in museum collections gathered by Europeans during the colonial era. They were spread by Polynesians primarily through vegetative propagation with cuttings and root shoots. They were rarely cultivated from seeds, as most plants were harvested prior to flowering, when the stems reach around in diameter, as described by 18th-century European accounts. If the feral plants reproduced sexually is unknown, as the plants are dioecious and require both male and female specimens to be present in one island. Description This species is a deciduous shrub or tree usually growing tall, but known to reach at times. The leaves are variable in shape, even on one individual. The blades may be lobed or unlobed, but they usually have toothed edges, lightly hairy, pale undersides, and a rough texture. They are up to about long. The species has male and female flowers on separate plants. The staminate inflorescence is a catkin up to long with fuzzy male flowers. The pistillate inflorescence is a spherical head up to about wide with greenish female flowers trailing long styles. The infructescence is a spherical cluster wide containing many red or orange fruits. Each individual protruding fruit in the cluster is a drupe. Uses This plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine. =Barkcloth= Paper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (tapa in most Polynesian languages). Barkcloth can also be made from other members of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including Ficus (figs) and Artocarpus. Barkcloth was also occasionally made from Pipturus nettles, especially in Hawaii. However, the highest quality of barkcloth was from paper mulberry. Barkcloth was mainly used for clothing among ancient Austronesians and is traditionally made using characteristic stone or wooden beaters, which are among the most common artifacts found in Austronesian archaeological sites. Numerous archaeological remains of barkcloth beaters in southern China have been regarded as evidence that the pre-Taiwan Austronesian homelands were located in the region prior to the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty, particularly around the Pearl River Delta. The oldest such remains are from the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, dated to around 7,900 BP. Barkcloth remained an important source of clothing fabrics in pre-colonial Melanesia, Polynesia, and parts of Indonesia. However, it has been mostly replaced by woven fiber clothing in most of Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia. It is still worn ceremonially in parts of Polynesia and Melanesia. It is also used to make bags and bedding. Although numerous names are used for paper mulberry throughout Austronesia, none are cognates, thus a Proto-Oceanic term cannot be reconstructed. In most of Polynesia, the term for barkcloth can be reconstructed from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *taba, meaning \\"bark\\", with cognates including Wayan taba; Tongan, Samoan, Mangareva, and Rarotongan tapa; and Hawaiian kapa. Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word *siapo, with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan hiapo; and Samoan and East Futunan siapo. The term for barkcloth beater, however, can be reconstructed more extensively back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ikay, with cognates including Uma ike; Sa'a iki; Bauan, Tongan, and East Futunan ike; and Samoan and Hawaiian i ªe.Blust, Robert & Trussel, Steve (work-in-progress). *ikay, Austronesian Comparative Dictionary, web edition. =Paper= It is a significant fiber crop in the history of paper. It was used for papermaking in China by around 100 AD. It was used to make washi in Japan by 600 AD. Washi, a Japanese handcrafted paper, is made with the inner bark, which is pounded and mixed with water to produce a paste, which is dried into sheets. It is also used to make hanji, a Korean paper. =Other uses= The wood of the plant is useful for making furniture and utensils, and the roots can be used as rope. The fruit and cooked leaves are edible. The fruit, leaves, and bark have been used in systems of traditional medicine. For example, the bark and fruit of the species, known locally as jangli toot, are used as a laxative and antipyretic in rural Pakistan.Hussain, K., et al. (2008). An ethnobotanical survey of important wild medicinal plants of Hattar district Haripur, Pakistan. Ethnobotanical Leaflets 12, 29-35. The species is used as an ornamental plant. It tolerates disturbance and air pollution, so it has been useful as a landscaping plant on roadsides. It is a pioneer species that easily fills forest clearings, and it has been considered for reforestation efforts. It grows well in many climate types.Morgan, E. C. and W. A. Overholt. Wildland Weeds: Paper Mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera. ENY-702. Entomology and Nematology. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. Published 2004, revised 2013. Invasive weed The ability of the plant to readily colonize available habitat, particularly disturbed areas, has helped it become an invasive species in some regions. It spreads rapidly when male and female individuals grow together and seeds are produced. Seed dispersal is accomplished by animals that eat the fruits, and the plants can form wide, dense stands via their spreading root systems. This is considered to be one of the worst weeds in Pakistan, one of the most significant invasive plants on the Pampas in Argentina, and a dominant invasive in the forests of Uganda. The pollen is allergenic. It is reportedly a main culprit of inhalant allergy in Islamabad, where the species is a very common urban weed.Malik, R. N. and S. Z. Husain. (2007). Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) L'h√©r. Ex Vent.: an environmental constraint on the Himalayan foothills vegetation. Pakistan Journal of Botany 39(4), 1045-53. The pollen allergy and asthma caused by this plant sends thousands of patients to hospitals in Islamabad during March. The species should not be taken to other areas without due consideration of the potential of male plants to shed their injurious pollen.

Noirmoutier (also in French: √éle de Noirmoutier) is a tidal island off the Atlantic coast of France in the Vend√©e department. History Noirmoutier was the location of an early Viking raid in 799, when raiders attacked the monastery of Saint Philibert of Jumi√®ges in 799.Sawyer, Peter. \\"The Viking Expansion.\\" The Cambridge History of Scandinavia, Volume 1: Prehistory to 1520. 105. The Vikings established a permanent base on the island around 824, from which they could control southeast Brittany by the 840s. In 848, they sacked Bordeaux. From 862 until 882, Hastein used it as a base from which he raided Francia and Brittany. St. Mary Euphrasia Pelletier was born on this island on July 31, 1796. Geography The island comprises ten localities and four distinct Communes of France. Its length is approximately , and its width varies from to . Its area of . Noirmoutier is referred to as the Island of Mimosas, due to the temperateness of its climate, which allows for the flowering of Acacia dealbata (mimosa) year-round. The island is predominantly salt marsh and salt banks, sand dunes and evergreen oak forests. The communes of the island are grouped into a communaut√© de communes. The communes are: * Barb√¢tre * L'√âpine * La Gu√©rini√®re * Noirmoutier-en-l'√éle The island has been a site of uninterrupted human inhabitation since prehistoric times, and is a popular tourist destination. Parts of the island have been reclaimed from the sea. In 2005 it served as the finish of the Tour de France prologue. Transport Noirmoutier has been connected to mainland France by bridge since 1971. The island is most notable for the Passage du Gois, a paved-over sandbank with a length of , one of the routes that connect the island to the mainland. It is flooded twice a day by the high tide. Events Every year, a foot race; the Foul√©es du Gois, is held across it, starting at the onset of the high tide. Infrastructure In response to an effort by the French government to add offshore wind projects to the national grid, a 496 MW wind farm is being developed near the island, with a planned commissioning date of 2021. Climate Noirmoutier experiences an oceanic climate typical of the west coast of France. Both the winters and summers are heavily moderated by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean. There is a low degree of diurnal temperature variation throughout the year, especially in the winter. There is considerably more precipitation in winter compared to summer.

Education Gibson studied at Sacramento State University and with Henry Onderdonk and Wayne Peterson at San Francisco State University, where he earned a BA in 1964. His earliest work as an improviser and composer also dates from around this time, when he performed in the New Music Ensemble with composers Larry Austin, Richard Swift, and Stanley Lunetta.  Career  Gibson used various instruments from around the world in his performances of jazz and classical music. He was a founding member of the Philip Glass Ensemble. Gibson performed in the premieres of In C by Terry Riley and Drumming by Steve Reich, as well as Reich's 1967 composition Reed Phase, which Reich wrote especially for him. For a time in the 1960s, alongside Philip Glass & Steve Reich, Gibson performed the music of Moondog during weekly sessions with the composer, recordings of which were made by Reich. He was briefly a member of the Theatre of Eternal Music with La Monte Young, and in the 1970s Gibson studied with Pandit Pran Nath. He also performed and recorded with other composers, some of them minimalists, including Christian Wolff, David Behrman, Harold Budd, Alvin Curran, Arthur Russell, Annea Lockwood and Frederic Rzewski. In 1973, Gibson's debut solo recording Visitations was released on the Chatham Square label, run by Philip Glass. Visitations is a departure from the structured repetitions of his minimalist contemporaries, instead using field recordings, ambient flutes, synthesizers and free-flowing percussive textures. In 1977 Two Solo Pieces was released, also on the Chatham Square imprint, consisting of the droning organ composition Cycles and Untitled, a piece for solo alto flute. Gibson was also an accomplished visual artist. Throughout his career, he created numerous graphic text based works laden with musical information. He also created the cover artwork for albums such as Two Solo Pieces and Criss X Cross. Gibson died on October 11, 2020.

He was largely self-taught as a composer, and belongs to the figures of the English Musical Renaissance. A successful composer of light music and theatre scores, his principal creative energies went into more ambitious and exploratory works that were particularly influenced by Indian music. Suffering a setback after the decline in popularity of his World Requiem (1919‚Äì1921), he left London for Paris in 1927, and eventually travelled to India in 1935 where, among other things, he collected folk music, composed pieces for traditional Indian instrument ensembles, and worked for a radio station. Foulds was an adventurous figure of great innate musicality and superb technical skill. Among his best works are Three Mantras for orchestra and wordless chorus (1919‚Äì1930), Essays in the Modes for piano (1920‚Äì1927), the piano concerto Dynamic Triptych (1927‚Äì1929), and his ninth string quartet Quartetto Intimo (1931‚Äì1932). Biography John Foulds was born in Hulme, Manchester, England, on 2 November 1880, the son of a bassoonist in the Hall√© Orchestra. Prolific from childhood, Foulds himself joined the Hall√© as a cellist in 1900, having already served an apprenticeship in theatre and promenade orchestras in England and abroad. Hans Richter gave him conducting experience; Henry Wood took up some of his works, starting with Epithalamium at the 1906 Queen's Hall Proms. Foulds was Jewish.Foulds, John  Indian Suite (1932-35) - Repertoire Explorer https://repertoire- explorer.musikmph.de ‚Ä∫ Home ‚Ä∫ Works for orchestra ‚Ä∫ Orchestra John Foulds is, to my mind, perhaps the greatest twentieth-century composer ... His ancestors were French-based Jewish bankers, one of whom, Achille Fould, ... In some respects ahead of his time (he started using quarter-tones as early as the 1890s, while some of his later works anticipate Messiaen and Minimalism), Foulds was in others an intensely practical musician. He became a successful composer of light music ‚Äì his Keltic Lament was once a popular favourite and in the 1920s the BBC scheduled his music on a daily basis. This was a source of irritation to Foulds; in 1933 he complained to Adrian Boult at the BBC that his serious music was not being performed: \\"[My light works] number a dozen or so, as compared with the total of 50 of my serious works. This state of affairs is rather a galling one for a serious artist.\\" Foulds also wrote many effective theatre scores, notably for his friends Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndike. Perhaps the best known was the music for the first production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan (Foulds conducted a Suite from it at the Queen's Hall Proms in 1925). He also wrote the score for Casson's highly successful West End production of Shakespeare's Henry VIII, which ran from December 1925 to March 1926. However, his principal creative energies went into more ambitious and exploratory works, often coloured by his interest in the music of the East, especially India. A postcard of the Royal Albert Hall (c.1903) (with an inset of the Albert Memorial), where Foulds' World Requiem (1919‚Äì1921) was performed in 1923 and 1926; in 1924 and 1925 it was performed at the Queen's Hall. Foulds moved to London before World War I, and in 1915 during the war he met the violinist Maud MacCarthy, one of the leading Western authorities on Indian music. His gigantic World Requiem (1919‚Äì1921), in memory of the dead of all nations, was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Foulds, under the auspices of The Royal British Legion on Armistice Night, 11 November, in 1923 by up to 1,250 instrumentalists and singers; the latter were called the Cenotaph choir. Performances in 1924 and 1925 took place at the Queen's Hall. In 1926 it returned to the Albert Hall, but this was to be the last performance until 2007, again at the Albert Hall. The performances in 1923‚Äì26 constituted the first Festivals of Remembrance. While some critics were not impressed by the work, it was nonetheless popular. One newspaper wrote: \\"The scope of the work is beyond what anyone has dared to attempt hitherto. It is no less than to find expression for the deepest and most widespread unhappiness this generation has ever known. As such it was received by a very large number of listeners, who evidently felt that music alone could do this for them.\\" However, the work ceased to be performed after 1926. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy against Foulds ‚Äì his biographer Malcolm MacDonald has, for instance, implied some sort of \\"intrigue\\". It appears Foulds was regarded as an inappropriate composer for the occasion because he had not fought in the war, or because of his suspected Left-wing views. When interest in the World Requiem lapsed, Foulds suffered a grave setback and in 1927 left for Paris, working there as an accompanist for silent films. Here, he was acquainted with the Irish-American composer Swan Hennessy with whom he shared an interest in musical Celticism.Letter from Hennessy to the music critic Irving Schwerke, 22 May 1929; Library of Congress, Irving Schwerke Collection. In 1934 he published a book on contemporary musical developments, Music To-day. In 1935 he travelled to India, where he collected folk music, became Director of European Music for All-India Radio in Delhi, created an orchestra from scratch, and began to work towards his dream of a musical synthesis of East and West, actually composing pieces for ensembles of traditional Indian instruments. He was so successful that he was asked to open a branch of the station in Calcutta. Tragically, within a week of arriving there, he died suddenly of cholera on 25 April 1939. Foulds was responsible for banning the use of the harmonium on Indian music broadcast on radio. Foulds' most substantial compositions include string quartets, symphonic poems, concertos, piano pieces and a huge \\"concert opera\\" on Dante's The Divine Comedy (1905‚Äì1908), as well as a series of \\"Music-Pictures\\" exploring the affinities between music and styles of painting.See (Henry Wood introduced one of them at the 1913 Proms.) Few of these works were performed and fewer published in his lifetime, and several, especially from his last period in India, are lost. (The missing scores included a Symphony of East and West for Oriental instruments and Western symphony orchestra.) Foulds' daughter deposited some of the surviving manuscripts by her father in the British Library. Revival Foulds became a footnote to English music after his death, but from 1974 Malcolm MacDonald, editor of the music journal Tempo under the alias Calum MacDonald, conducted an often lonely campaign for Foulds after he came across the Foulds scores deposited in the British Library. MacDonald tracked down Foulds' daughter, who took him to a garage and showed him two coffin-sized boxes full of sketches and manuscripts she had been left by her mother. Unfortunately, many of the manuscripts were damaged: apparently, rats and ants had got at them while they were in India, where Foulds' wife stayed after his death. An acclaimed recording of Foulds' string quartet music, including the previously unperformed Quartetto Intimo, by the Endellion Quartet in the early 1980s, began to reawaken interest in him, and this was sustained in the early 1990s by Lyrita Recorded Edition's decision to issue some of Foulds' works including Three Mantras and Dynamic Triptych on CD. A Proms performance of Three Mantras in 1998 was well received, and soon after the Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo began to champion Foulds' work in concerts with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), to huge critical acclaim. In November 2005, the CBSO, with Peter Donohoe, gave the first live performance for more than 70 years of Foulds' piano concerto, the Dynamic Triptych (1927‚Äì1929). The orchestra has issued two well-received CDs of Foulds' music. On Armistice Night, 11 November 2007, the Royal Albert Hall staged the first performance for 81 years of the World Requiem under the auspices of the BBC, with the Trinity Boys Choir and Leon Botstein as conductor.BBC Symphony Orchestra press release dated 25 July 2007; see also The performance was recorded live and released in Super Audio CD format by Chandos Records in January 2008. Foulds' Keltic Lament has once again become popular due to its regular playing on Classic FM, and BBC Radio 3 plans to revive a tradition of performing A World Requiem on Armistice Day. Personal life John Foulds was only 21 when he married librarian Dora Woodcock in 1902. She was seven years his senior and the daughter of a Yorkshire-born bookseller who had settled in Llandudno. Their son Michael Raymond was born in Manchester in 1911. Foulds met his musical soul mate Maud MacCarthy in 1915 after moving to London. She was married to William Mann with whom she had a daughter Joan, born in 1913. According to Malcolm MacDonald's account, both were in unhappy marriages and it was love at first sight. Rather than enter into a clandestine affair, they laid the matter before their respective spouses. The two couples met together and agreed amicably on the divorces which would allow John and Maud to marry, though they did not in fact do so until 1932. They were to have two children: John Patrick born in 1916 and a daughter Marybride in 1922.

She has been a member of That Dog, Tito & Tarantula, and The Decemberists; has contributed to recordings by Bill Frisell, The Twilight Singers, Beck, Mike Watt, Luscious Jackson, Sun Kil Moon, Foo Fighters, Green Day, Weezer, The Rentals, Victoria Williams, Yuka Honda, The Gutter Twins, Sunn O))), and Cornelius. She is the daughter of the jazz bassist Charlie Haden; the triplet sister of bassist Rachel Haden (her bandmate in That Dog) and cellist Tanya Haden (married to singer and actor Jack Black) with whom she has performed as The Haden Triplets; and the sister of bassist-singer Josh Haden, leader of the group Spain. Biography In New York City, in 1996 she released her first album, Imaginaryland, consisting mostly of original a cappella music. In 2000, Petra was struck by a car while crossing a street in Los Angeles; the resulting injuries forced her out of performance for several months. In 2005 she released the home-recorded album Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out (Bar/None), a complete a cappella rendition of The Who Sell Out. The project was suggested to Haden by longtime friend Mike Watt, who also gave her the eight-channel multi-track cassette recorder she used to make it. Funded in part by a Durfee grant and wanting to perform the work live, Haden created a new arrangement of The Who Sell Out for a ten-woman a cappella choir called Petra Haden & The Sellouts. The premiere live performance of the full work occurred in July 2005 at the Ford Amphitheatre as a part of the \\"sound.\\" concert series. She has also released a self-titled collaboration with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. She contributed to the recording of √ò√ò Void by drone metal band Sunn O))) and played on the debut and follow up album of Sunn O))) guitarist Greg Anderson's other doom metal band Goatsnake. The Haden Triplets sang the part of the Fates in Ana√Øs Mitchell's 2010 release Hadestown on Righteous Babe Records. She is also at work on a collection of songs with Yuka Honda, apparently with contributing performances by Sean Lennon. In 2007, Haden recorded an a cappella cover of Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" for the compilation album Guilt by Association Vol. 1. This arrangement of the song is very similar to that used in the Glee version of the song in 2009. She performed on the soundtrack to the film An American Crime, starring Catherine Keener and Ellen Page, which premiered on Showtime in May 2008. In 2009, Toyota commissioned Haden to perform three songs for television commercials for the third-generation Toyota Prius, including an a cappella version of the Bellamy Brothers 1970s song \\"Let Your Love Flow\\" and worked as an arranger and vocal coach on The Sing Off on NBC, alongside Deke Sharon. Haden played violin on \\"Sentimental Tune\\" by Tegan and Sara, off of their album Sainthood (released October 27, 2009). In 2011, Haden formed the group If By Yes with Yuka Honda, the culmination of an eight-year songwriting collaboration. The band released one album, \\"Salt on Sea Glass\\" Other band members included Yuko Araki on drums and Hirotaka ‚ÄúShimmy‚Äù Shimizu on guitar, with contributions from David Byrne and Nels Cline. In 2014 she worked on a collaboration with Jim Bianco in Hooray Matinee. The resulting tracks were released on a number of digital outlets. In 2015, she provided vocals for the rock mockumentary \\"Gentle & Soft: The Blue Jean Committee Story\\", the 1st season finale of the IFC series Documentary Now! (starring Fred Armisen & Bill Hader). Haden's voice was used as the falsetto of Blue Jean Committee bassist Clark Honus (played by Hader). Haden even appeared live with Armisen & Hader as \\"The Blue Jean Committee\\" on Late Night With Seth Meyers, with Hader lip-synching to Haden's vocals. Also in 2015, Haden again collaborated with Bill Frisell, providing vocals on his 2016 album When You Wish Upon A Star. In 2016, the song \\"Easy Street\\" by The Collapsable Hearts Club, which featured Haden and Jim Bianco, played throughout The Walking Dead episode \\"The Cell\\". A few hours after the episode's broadcast, the song rose to number 92 in the UK Singles Chart.

It focused on artists that are generally outside the metal mainstream, and occasionally covers other forms of extreme music as well.Leininger, Merrie (May 19, 2006). \\"In Flames plays unpretentious metal\\", Reno Gazette-Journal, p. H16. Online since August 1995, Chronicles of Chaos was one of the first webzines in the world for that genre of music.(December 9, 2008). \\"Adrian Bromley RIP\\", Antimusic News. Retrieved January 21, 2013. It was a nonprofit publication since its inception. Chronicles of Chaos stopped publishing new articles in August 2015. History Chronicles of Chaos was founded by Canadians Gino Filicetti and Adrian Bromley in 1995,Albert, Jaclyn; O'Connor, Laura (January 31, 2009). \\"Adrian Bromley\\", Billboard 121 (4): 18. and started out in the shape of a monthly e-mail digest. In its early years, CoC was one of the few to publish reviews and interviews on the Internet featuring bands such as Eyehategod, Nevermore, Strapping Young Lad and Dimmu Borgir before they were well known, as well as numerous other bands that were popular in the mid-1990s metal underground, including At the Gates, Fear Factory, Dismember, Dissection, Brutal Truth, Napalm Death, Sepultura, Hypocrisy, My Dying Bride, Type O Negative, Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Paradise Lost, Amorphis, Morbid Angel, In Flames, Sentenced, Therion, Emperor, Vader, Grimlord, Bolt Thrower, Opeth and Slayer, among others. CoC also interviewed the leaders of labels such as Earache Records, Peaceville and The End Records. =1995‚Äì2002= Initially composed of four contributors from Canada and the USA in 1995, the staff eventually reached a stable set of nine writers in 1997, including the first European contributor. Near the year 2000, the European contingent was expanded by three new writers, with representatives from the Asian and African continents joining shortly after. This led to a core staff of twelve writers in 2002. In this period, founder Filicetti retired from his role as contributor, while co-founder Bromley moved on to form his own print publication, Unrestrained!, with fellow CoC contributor Adam Wasylyk. Meanwhile, various other writers departed or became part-time contributors due to other engagements. Some of Chronicles of Chaos' writing staff became contributors to magazines like Metal Hammer, Terrorizer, Unrestrained! and more. As a result, the e-mail issues became less regular, with as much as three month gaps. Between October 2002 and March 2003 the publication went on an unofficial hiatus for the only time in its history. Until 2003, the Chronicles of Chaos website served only as a static repository of plain text back issues, with the latest digest available for hypertext navigation. =2003‚Äì2015= From 2003 onwards, the publication adopted a database-driven website. Older articles previously found only inside plain text files became immediately accessible, and the new system also allowed articles to be published more frequently and directly to the website. The e-mail digest returned to its original monthly schedule, gathering up the articles published on the website during that month. More than 100 issues of the e-mail digest were published until 2011, containing over 20 megabytes of text. The staff was gradually augmented between 2003 and 2008 with the addition of new European, American and Australian writers. This led to a total of around twenty writers, although several of those were only sporadic part- time contributors who were previously an integral part of the publication pre-2003. In keeping with its international tradition, over a dozen different nationalities were represented in the staff. In 2007, Chronicles of Chaos was mentioned by sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris in his book on extreme metal. On December 7, 2008, Chronicles of Chaos co-founder Adrian Bromley died due to pneumonia, in his sleep, aged 37. His passing prompted numerous tributes within the music industry. =2015‚Äìpresent= On August 12, 2015, marking the twentieth anniversary of the magazine, founder Gino Filicetti and co-editor Pedro Azevedo announced that Chronicles of Chaos had ceased publication of new articles. The reasons for this decision included much increased public access to streaming and downloading albums, as well as a dearth of new writers. The announcement was coupled with opinion articles from several of CoC's current and former writers. Chronicles of Chaos remains online as an archive, containing over 7,500 reviews, interviews and opinion articles that were published during a span of twenty years.

The cave is inside the Hochkogel mountain in the Tennengebirge section of the Alps. It is the largest ice cave in the world, extending more than 42 km and visited by about 200,000 tourists every year.  Geology  Layers of zebra limestone under the cave The Tennengebirge mountains were formed during the late Tertiary period, during the W√ºrm glaciation period of the Pleistocene. The mountain range, one of the massifs in the Austrian Alps, is the largest karst plateau in the Salzburger Alps, and the Eisriesenwelt is located at the rim of this plateau. Although the cave has a length of 42 km, only the first kilometer, the area that tourists are allowed to visit, is covered in ice. The rest of the cave is formed of limestone. Eisriesenwelt was formed by the Salzach river, which eroded passageways into the mountain. The ice formations in the cave were formed by thawing snow which drained into the cave and froze during winter. Since the entrance to the caves is open year- round, chilly winter winds blow into the cave and freeze the snow inside. In summer, a cold wind from inside the cave blows toward the entrance and prevents the formations from melting.  History  The first official discovery of Eisriesenwelt was by Anton Posselt, a natural scientist from Salzburg, in 1879, though he only explored the first two hundred meters of the cave. Before his discovery, the cave was known only to locals, who, believing that it was an entrance to Hell, refused to explore it. In 1880, Posselt published his findings in a mountaineering magazine, but the report was quickly forgotten. , a speleologist from Salzburg, was one of the few people who remembered Posselt's discovery. He led several expeditions into the caves beginning in 1912, which were soon followed by other explorers. Von M√∂rk was killed in World War I in 1914, and an urn containing his ashes is inside a niche in the cave. In 1920, a cabin for the explorers, Forscherh√ºtte, was built and the first routes up the mountain were established. Tourists began to arrive soon after, attracted by the cave's sudden popularity. Later another cabin, the Dr. Oedl House, and paths from Werfen and Tenneck were constructed. In 1955 a cable car was built, shortening the 90-minute climb to 3 minutes. Today the Eisriesenwelt cave is owned by the , which has leased it to the Salzburg Association of Cave Exploration since 1928. The Forest Commission still receives a percentage of the entrance fees.  Visiting  Entrance of the cave The cave is open from May 1 to October 26 every year. Its operating hours are 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in July and August and 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in May/June and September/October. Temperatures inside the cave are usually below freezing, and warm clothing is recommended. Photography is not permitted once visitors are inside the cave. The tour begins at the entrance to the cave, and continues inwards to Posselt Hall, a large room with a stalagmite called Posselt Tower in the centre. Past the Posselt Tower, one encounters an ashen cross on the wall of the cave, marking the farthest point of exploration of Anton Posselt. From there one can see the Great Ice Embankment, a massive formation that rises to a height of 25 metres and represents the area of greatest ice growth. Next is Hymir's Castle, named after a giant in Norse mythology. Here stalactites create a formation called Frigga's Veil, or the Ice Organ. Next on the tour is the Alexander von M√∂rk Cathedral, one of the largest rooms in the cave and the final resting place of von M√∂rk's ashes. The final stop on the tour is the Ice Palace, a kilometre into the cave and 400 metres underground. From here, visitors must turn around and walk back through the caves to reach the entrance. The round-trip tour through the cave takes around one hour and 15 minutes.  Gallery  File:Eisriesenwelt Werfen Austria 01.jpgA closeup of one of the ice formations.

While not officially considered a World's Fair by the Bureau of International Expositions, it is often informally described as such; the exposition attracted both exhibits and visitors from around the world. During the exposition's four-month run, it attracted over 1.6 million visitors, and featured exhibits from 21 countries. Portland grew from 161,000 to 270,000 residents between 1905 and 1910, a spurt that has been attributed to the exposition. Preparations =Early Oregon= Since its founding in 1845, Portland had evolved into a major economic center, largely fueled by the arrival of the railroads. Three transcontinental railroads used Portland as their Pacific coast terminus ‚Äì the Northern, Southern, and Union Pacific Railroads.Piper, Edgar B, \\"Portland and the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition,\\" The American Monthly Review of Reviews 31 (Apr 1905): 420-427; p. 421.Zwick, Jim ed., World's Fairs and Expositions: Defining America and the World, 1876-1916 Meanwhile, Portland's wheat and flour industries were growing at an amazing rate, and Portland held \\"the largest flour mill on the Pacific coast.\\" The unparalleled timber industry continued to grow, as \\"Oregon is second [in wooded area], with 54,300 square miles\\" and \\"in quantity of standing lumber, Oregon leads the Union, with 300 billion feet ...\\", also available at Zwick, World's Fairs and Expositions: Defining America and the World, 1876-1916 Oregon's shipping was growing, too, fueled by a $1.5 million project to dike and dredge the Columbia River. During this time, Oregon's population grew from 13,294 in 1850 to 413,536 in 1900, a 3,000-percent growth, compared to the 1000-percent growth of the nation as a whole. Despite all these positive factors, though, Oregon was not unaffected by the nationwide Long Depression, which had particular effect in 1893. Jobs were lost across the country as railroads grew too fast on a weak banking system and agricultural values fell. The state's elite business leaders all attempted to devise plans to boost the economy. Dan McAllen, a dry goods merchant, suggested in 1895 \\"that Portland mark the new century and pull itself out of its economic slump by holding some sort of international fair.\\"Abbott, Carl, The Great Extravaganza: Portland and the Lewis and Clark Exposition (Portland: Oregon Historical Society, 1981); p. 13. Since the area's focus was on other issues, his proposal went unnoticed for a few years. The idea of a fair came up again occasionally, but no concentrated effort was made for various reasons. It was not until mid-1900 that this sort of action began, when \\"J.M. Long of the Portland Board of Trade put together a provisional committee\\" to begin planning some sort of fair. Soon, a permanent board was conceived, and the head of the Portland General Electric Company, Henry W. Goode, became the president of the Board of Directors.Rydell, Robert, \\"Visions of Empire: International Expositions in Portland and Seattle, 1905-1909\\" Pacific Historical Review 52(1):37-65; p. 42. Others included I. N. Fleischner, First Vice-President; Oskar Huber, Director of Works; Colonel Henry E. Dosch, Director of Exhibits; Henry E. Reed, Secretary; and J. A. Wakefield, Director of Concessions and Admissions. These were some of Portland's most wealthy and powerful men, working together to create an event of unmatched grandeur and power. =Finding a theme= Lewis and Clark on the Lower Columbia Although the true motivation for the fair came from an economic and business standpoint, it was still crucial to have a theme for publicity and d√©cor. The theme for the Portland fair came from the advice of the Oregon Historical Society. They suggested that the centennial anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition's stay in Oregon would be a perfect event to commemorate. As the directors wanted to include their dreams of economic growth as well, they combined the two ideas into a title that \\"summed up the dual goals of historic commemoration and regional boosterism: 'The Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair.'\\" In addition, a motto was decided on, to focus the festivities and bolster publicity: \\"Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way.\\" =Funding= Once a theme was set, the men began securing exhibits and getting support for their investments. Getting government backing was crucial due to the personal investments already made: \\"The Ladd and Tilton Bank [invested] $20,000, the Northern Pacific Railroad another $20,000, and brewer Henry Weinhard $10,000.\\" Many of the substantial investments were from hotels (the Imperial Hotel Company purchased 50 shares worth $5,000), restaurants, streetcar companies, and retailers ‚Äì all groups with much to gain from the success of the fair and the economic prosperity it could provide. In addition, approximately 3,000 average citizens purchased stock certificates both as investment opportunities and to support what they viewed as a worthwhile venture. These individual investments eventually paid off greatly. =Political action= Seeing the potential benefits of the fair's success, the state legislature began planning appropriations for the fair. Although they \\"had [little] interest in the historical heroes and their trek ... they [shared] the vision of Pacific trade that had motivated the exploration and settlement of the Oregon Country.\\" Thus, the Legislature passed \\"An Act Celebrating the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Exploration of the Oregon Country,\\" which appropriated a sum of approximately $500,000 for the fair.\\"Report of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission,\\" Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition collection, Box 27, Folder 6, p. 5. After the Fair's completion, it was reported that > The money expended by the two departments amounted to about four hundred > thousand dollars each, the State appropriating that expended by the > Commission, while the stockholders of the Corporation subscribed about an > equal amount. The proceeds from the Exposition were expended entirely under > the direction of the Corporation. The government of the United States > appropriated $475,000 and about an equal value in exhibits, the exact > amounts of which I am unable to give. Thus the fair received funding to hold the exposition. The bill that appropriated the funds also created a special commission to oversee the organization of the fair. As this Commission reported: \\"The Lewis and Clark Exposition was held jointly, under the authorization of the act creating this Commission, by the Commission and the Lewis and Clark Exposition Corporation.\\"\\"Report of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission,\\" Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition collection, Box 27, Folder 6, p.13. First assembling on May 30, 1903, they were a committee appointed by the government with the intent of sharing the burdens of planning. On this date, they chose a president, Jefferson Myers, who \\"made a speech ... urging hearty co-operation with the Lewis and Clark directors to bring about the best results. He later repeated these assurances of help to the directors.\\"\\"To Work Again\\". The Oregonian, Vol. 42, No. 13, 250 (May 30, 1903), p. 1. This seemed to go well, and their assistance helped guide the fair through the governmental hurdles inherent with the planning of such a venture. After the closing of the fair, Henry Reed, Secretary for the Exposition Corporation, created a hefty volume documenting the whole process of planning and running the event.Reed, Henry, History of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition (Unpublished). He, too, spoke highly of the government's involvement, and wrote that \\"The State of Oregon gave more solid help ... to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, than any other state of the Union has ever given to an exposition held within its borders.\\"Reed, History of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, p. 97. He was also specifically grateful for the City of Portland's assistance, and noted that their \\"cordial and enthusiastic backing\\" was invaluable to the success of the Fair.Reed, History of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, p. 350. These praises of Portland were repeated by the State Commission, further supporting the city's great assistance.\\"Report of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission,\\" Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition collection, Box 27, Folder 6, p. 6. Exposition grounds Overview of the grounds =Finding a site= The four people most responsible for the exposition, per Joseph Gaston: 1. Henry W. Corbett 2. Lewis B. Cox 3. Henry E. Dosch 4. Henry L. Pittock After gaining the necessary financial backing (and the Commission that came with it), the Board of Directors then began the process of choosing a site on which to hold this fair. There were a number of locations considered, on both the east and west sides of the Willamette River. The three main sites on the eastern side were University Park, now the site of the University of Portland; City View Park, now Sellwood Park and Oaks Park; and Hawthorne Park, now an industrial area. The western sites considered were City Park, now Washington Park; and Guild's Lake in the Balch Creek watershed. Guild's Lake was a site \\"everyone in Portland was vaguely aware of ... [though] no one on the site selection subcommittee could remember whether it evaporated during the dry season.\\" Inspections showed it remained at a depth of through the summer, and therefore would be an appropriate site. By September 4, 1902, the Oregon Journal reported \\"the fair officials are hot on the trail of a site and it is confidently predicted that 'something will be doing' shortly.\\"Oregon Journal, Vol. 1, No. 153 (September 4, 1902), p. 2. The next day, they reported the committee narrowed its choices to \\"two tracts ... Willamette heights on the west side and Hawthorne Park, with a portion of the Ladd tract, on the east side,\\" and that Willamette Heights was to be chosen, as \\"It is claimed that the natural advantages offered by the Willamette Heights outweigh all other considerations and that ... Guild's Lake, it is said, can be utilized to great advantage and made a scene of beauty.\\"\\"Site of the Fair\\" Oregon Journal, Vol. 1, No. 154 (September 5, 1902), p. 1. With this voting, \\"the Lewis and Clark Exposition had its site ‚Äì a grove of trees, of pasture, and of waist-high stagnant water at the site's center.\\" Guild's Lake had numerous other advantages. As the site was located on the edge of settlement in Portland, it was easily accessed by the populace. Two local trolley lines (the Portland Railway and City Suburban Railway) ran to within one block of the proposed entrance. Guild's Lake also had the advantage of being located adjacent to the recently constructed Vaughn Street Park, a baseball stadium which would prove rather useful during the operation of the fair. The site was also accessible from the river, and steamers provided visitors a ride to the site for 10 cents. The site was sold for private development prior to the fair, and was leased back to the city for the event. =Design and construction= Groundbreaking ceremony of the Expo. Numerous individuals were involved in the design and construction of the fairgrounds and buildings. The Olmsted Brothers design firm was hired to develop a plan for the grounds, for $5,000. The plan designed by John Charles Olmsted took advantage of the scenic views available from the site, including Mount St. Helens and the river. (Olmsted also developed a plan for Portland's park system during the same visit.) Ion Lewis, of the firm Whidden & Lewis, supervised a board of seven architects responsible for designing the fair's buildings. The six other architects were Edgar M. Lazarus, Emil Schacht, Justus F. Krumbein, David C. Lewis, Richard Martin, Jr., and Henry J. Hefty. The majority of the buildings were in the style of the Spanish Renaissance and decorated with architectural flourishes such as domes, cupolas, arched doorways and red-colored roofs. The buildings, not intended to be permanent, were largely constructed of plaster over wooden frames, which resulted in rather low construction costs (79 cents per foot). The major exception to this was the Forestry Building, a log cabin which was said to be the world's largest. It was constructed of 54 long unhewn logs, and contained exhibits of local forestry products, wildlife, and Native American photographs. The building was long, wide, and high (63 m x 31m x 22m), and cost nearly $30,000 Portland State University Department of History: 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition: The World's Largest Log Cabin The building stood until destroyed by fire in 1964 and inspired the Western Forestry Center as a replacement. It also inspired the lobby of the Glacier Park Lodge in Montana. The fair was lit up by night with incandescent lights, as well as large searchlights on the Government Building. These were designed by Thomas H. Wright, working for Portland General Electric. In addition, numerous statues adorned the grounds. Several of the statues remain today, including Alice Cooper's Sacajawea and Jean-Baptiste which now stands in Washington Park. Over 100 thousand light bulbs were used to outline the buildings, bridges, and statues; the result was a spectacular nighttime view. Some exhibits took up to three years to assemble. Exposition The exposition opened on June 1, 1905, and ran until October 15, 1905, a four and a half month span. It included exhibitions from 21 nations and 16 U.S. states, as well as numerous branches of the federal government, and private organizations. The Multnomah Athletic Club an amateur club from Portland, Oregon assisted in organizing the Lewis and Clark Athletic Games and Championship Contests. =Exhibits= The Prune Bear from the Sacramento Valley Inside of the Forestry Building The largest exhibit by a foreign nation was Italy's, whose pavilion contained a large collection of marble statues. Germany and France also spent enormous sums on their exhibits, the latter providing a replica of the drawing room of King Louis XIV. Japan spent $1 million (a significant sum in 1905) on its exhibit, including numerous cultural artifacts such as porcelains, silks, and lanterns. States with exhibits at the exposition were: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Oklahoma, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Each attending state was granted a day to publicize its exhibit, often attended by visiting dignitaries.Portland State University Department of History: 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition There were extensive exhibits on topics such as agriculture, technology, and music. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sent an exhibit, as did the Smithsonian Institution; numerous famous artists such as Claude Monet were featured. Some of the exhibits were controversial (and by modern standards, offensive), such as an exhibit of Philippines Igorot tribespeople; displayed in order to convince the American populace of the legitimacy of the recent U.S. conquest of the Philippines, taken from Spain in the recently concluded Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The exhibit included Irogots living in a simulated village, engaging in traditional activities. Some of these activities, such as preparation and consumption of dog meat, would be viewed as primitive to most visitors.Portland State University Department of History: 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition: Filipinos at the Fair Many exhibitors had to be turned away due to lack of space. =Other attractions= In addition to the major exhibits and pavilions, the site also featured an amusement park, various sideshows, concerts, free motion pictures (a novelty in those days), blimp excursions, and numerous vendors selling food and other items. The site was the finish line for a transcontinental automobile race (\\"Hell Gate to Portland\\") by two drivers sponsored by Olds Motor Works. The Amateur Athletic Union's National Track and Field Championships were held in PortlandUSA Outdoor Track & Field Championships from USA Track & Field at Vaughn Street Park. Portland's Pacific Coast League baseball team, known then as the \\"Giants\\", played the 1905 season at a different venue in Portland. =Economic effect= The fair, by all economic measures, was a major success. Over the entire run of the fair, the box office recorded almost 1.6 million paid admissions, an average of 11,600 visitors per day. Tickets to the fair cost 50 cents for adults, a quarter for children. Forty-thousand visitors attended on the opening day; 50,000 attended on the Fourth of July, and on the anniversary of Portland's incorporation, the daily attendance record of over 85,000 visitors was set. The vast majority (nearly 75%) of visitors were from the Pacific Northwest, with almost half being local residents.Abbott. (34% from Portland, 40% from other parts of Oregon and Washington; 16% from elsewhere in the western U.S., and 10% from east of the Rockies or from abroad. In all 2,554,000 people visited the exposition, with 966,000 getting in for free and 1,588,000 paying visitors. 135,000 visitors were from east of the Mississippi River. Unusual for such expositions, the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition was profitable, turning a gross profit of nearly $85,000. Capital investors received a 21% return on their investments. In addition, the impact on the local economy was significant. It is estimated a million out-of-town guests came to Portland, resulting in millions of dollars (in 1905 figures) added to the economy. In addition, construction of the fairgrounds provided 1,000 construction jobs. Legacy Forestry Building exterior Very little of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition remains today. The vast majority of the structures were designed to be temporary, and were torn down the following year, in 1906. A few structures were moved elsewhere and remained in use for a long time, most famously the Forestry Building, which was reinforced with a concrete foundation and converted into a forestry museum. It burned to the ground in August 1964. A replacement museum was built in Portland's Washington Park and is today known as the World Forestry Center.http://www.history.pdx.edu/guildslake/thefair/forestry2.htm PSU History Department: 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition: The World's Largest Log Cabin A few buildings from the fair remain standing today, including the Fairmount Hotel, the American Inn, and the National Cash Register Building (now the McMenamins St. Johns Theater and Pub).

Many people moved to Portland following the fair, which is why many houses around Portland were built in the years that followed. There were also many street paving and sidewalk projects in the years that followed the fair, and many of the sidewalks in Portland (East Portland especially) are dated from 1910 to 1920. Guild's Lake, a cutoff meander of the Willamette River around which the fairgrounds were built, was slowly filled in by industrial developers (and the Port of Portland) in the years after the fair; by the 1920s the lake had vanished entirely. The Columbia River: A Photographic Journey. Lewis and Clark 1905 Exposition, Portland OR Over the years, the grounds have been used for a garbage incinerator, a landfill, a rail switching yard, wartime housing, and warehouses. Today the ground formerly occupied by the lake (and the fairgrounds itself) is still used for primarily industrial purposes, and has been designated an Industrial Sanctuary by the City of Portland.

Water droplets on taro leaf with lotus effect (upper), and taro leaf surface magnified (0‚Äì1 is one millimetre span) showing a number of small protrusions (lower). Computer graphic of a lotus leaf surface. A water drop on a lotus surface showing contact angles of approximately 147¬∞. The lotus effect refers to self-cleaning properties that are a result of ultrahydrophobicity as exhibited by the leaves of Nelumbo or \\"lotus flower\\". Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to the micro- and nanoscopic architecture on the surface, which minimizes the droplet's adhesion to that surface. Ultrahydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties are also found in other plants, such as Tropaeolum (nasturtium), Opuntia (prickly pear), Alchemilla, cane, and also on the wings of certain insects. The phenomenon of ultrahydrophobicity was first studied by Dettre and Johnson in 1964 using rough hydrophobic surfaces. Their work developed a theoretical model based on experiments with glass beads coated with paraffin or PTFE telomer. The self-cleaning property of ultrahydrophobic micro- nanostructured surfaces was studied by Wilhelm Barthlott and Ehler in 1977, who described such self-cleaning and ultrahydrophobic properties for the first time as the \\"lotus effect\\"; perfluoroalkyl and perfluoropolyether ultrahydrophobic materials were developed by Brown in 1986 for handling chemical and biological fluids.Brown Laboratory vessel having hydrophobic coating and process for manufacturing same , Issued December 29, 1998 Other biotechnical applications have emerged since the 1990s.Barthlott, W., Mail, M., Bhushan, B., & K. Koch. (2017). Plant Surfaces: Structures and Functions for Biomimetic Innovations. Nano-Micro Letters, 9(23), doi:10.1007/s40820-016-0125-1. Functional principle The high surface tension of water causes droplets to assume a nearly spherical shape, since a sphere has minimal surface area, and this shape therefore minimizes the solid- liquid surface energy. On contact of liquid with a surface, adhesion forces result in wetting of the surface. Either complete or incomplete wetting may occur depending on the structure of the surface and the fluid tension of the droplet. The cause of self-cleaning properties is the hydrophobic water- repellent double structure of the surface. This enables the contact area and the adhesion force between surface and droplet to be significantly reduced, resulting in a self-cleaning process. This hierarchical double structure is formed out of a characteristic epidermis (its outermost layer called the cuticle) and the covering waxes. The epidermis of the lotus plant possesses papillae 10 Œºm to 20 Œºm in height and 10 Œºm to 15 Œºm in width on which the so- called epicuticular waxes are imposed. These superimposed waxes are hydrophobic and form the second layer of the double structure. This system regenerates. This biochemical property is responsible for the functioning of the water repellency of the surface. The hydrophobicity of a surface can be measured by its contact angle. The higher the contact angle the higher the hydrophobicity of a surface. Surfaces with a contact angle < 90¬∞ are referred to as hydrophilic and those with an angle >90¬∞ as hydrophobic. Some plants show contact angles up to 160¬∞ and are called ultrahydrophobic, meaning that only 2‚Äì3% of the surface of a droplet (of typical size) is in contact. Plants with a double structured surface like the lotus can reach a contact angle of 170¬∞, whereby the droplet's contact area is only 0.6%. All this leads to a self-cleaning effect. Dirt particles with an extremely reduced contact area are picked up by water droplets and are thus easily cleaned off the surface. If a water droplet rolls across such a contaminated surface the adhesion between the dirt particle, irrespective of its chemistry, and the droplet is higher than between the particle and the surface. This cleaning effect has been demonstrated on common materials such as stainless steel when a superhydrophobic surface is produced. As this self-cleaning effect is based on the high surface tension of water it does not work with organic solvents. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of a surface is no protection against graffiti. This effect is of a great importance for plants as a protection against pathogens like fungi or algae growth, and also for animals like butterflies, dragonflies and other insects not able to cleanse all their body parts. Another positive effect of self-cleaning is the prevention of contamination of the area of a plant surface exposed to light resulting in reduced photosynthesis. Technical application When it was discovered that the self-cleaning qualities of ultrahydrophobic surfaces come from physical- chemical properties at the microscopic to nanoscopic scale rather than from the specific chemical properties of the leaf surface, the possibility arose of using this effect in manmade surfaces, by mimicking nature in a general way rather than a specific one. Some nanotechnologists have developed treatments, coatings, paints, roof tiles, fabrics and other surfaces that can stay dry and clean themselves by replicating in a technical manner the self-cleaning properties of plants, such as the lotus plant. This can usually be achieved using special fluorochemical or silicone treatments on structured surfaces or with compositions containing micro-scale particulates. In addition to chemical surface treatments, which can be removed over time, metals have been sculpted with femtosecond pulse lasers to produce the lotus effect. The materials are uniformly black at any angle, which combined with the self-cleaning properties might produce very low maintenance solar thermal energy collectors, while the high durability of the metals could be used for self-cleaning latrines to reduce disease transmission. Further applications have been marketed, such as self-cleaning glasses installed in the sensors of traffic control units on German autobahns developed by a cooperation partner (Ferro GmbH). The Swiss companies HeiQ and Schoeller Textil have developed stain-resistant textiles under the brand names \\"HeiQ Eco Dry\\" and \\"nanosphere\\" respectively. In October 2005, tests of the Hohenstein Research Institute showed that clothes treated with NanoSphere technology allowed tomato sauce, coffee and red wine to be easily washed away even after a few washes. Another possible application is thus with self-cleaning awnings, tarpaulins and sails, which otherwise quickly become dirty and difficult to clean. Superhydrophobic coatings applied to microwave antennas can significantly reduce rain fade and the buildup of ice and snow. \\"Easy to clean\\" products in ads are often mistaken in the name of the self-cleaning properties of hydrophobic or ultrahydrophobic surfaces. Patterned ultrahydrophobic surfaces also show promise for \\"lab-on-a-chip\\" microfluidic devices and can greatly improve surface-based bioanalysis. Superhydrophobic or hydrophobic properties have been used in dew harvesting, or the funneling of water to a basin for use in irrigation. The Groasis Waterboxx has a lid with a microscopic pyramidal structure based on the ultrahydrophobic properties that funnel condensation and rainwater into a basin for release to a growing plant's roots. Research history Although the self-cleaning phenomenon of the lotus was possibly known in Asia long before (reference to the lotus effect is found in the Bhagavad Gita,Bhagavad Gita 5.10 ) its mechanism was explained only in the early 1970s after the introduction of the scanning electron microscope. Studies were performed with leaves of Tropaeolum and lotus (Nelumbo). \\"The Lotus Effect\\" is a registered trademark of STO SE & CO. KGAA (US Registration No. 2613850). Similar to lotus effect, a recent study has revealed a honeycomb like micro-structures on the taro leaf, which makes the leaf superhydrophobic. The measured contact angle on this leaf in this study is around 148 degrees.

Biography The son of a banker in √ñrebro, Bergman briefly studied philosophy at Uppsala University but soon broke off his studies and took up the life of a free writer. He married Stina Lindberg, the daughter of actor and stage producer August Lindberg and Augusta Lindberg, and sister of Per Lindberg. Up to his father's death in 1915 Bergman was heavily sponsored by the family patriarch; after the old man died from a stroke it turned out that the family business had become highly indebted and Bergman was forced to start making money out of his writing and court readers in a more outgoing and more entertaining manner. He rose to the challenge and in the following ten years reached the peak of his work. Much of his output takes place in a small town in mid-Sweden, which is growing into a parallel universe in a Balzacian manner. The shameful secrets of a dozen of interwoven families gradually come out of the closet as the stories grow increasingly symbolic. A pessimistic outlook is always counterbalanced by a grotesque humour - indeed in a book like Markurells i Wadk√∂ping the latter almost succeeds in completely shading the former. The fictional town Wadk√∂ping is modelled on the author's hometown √ñrebro. When √ñrebro in 1965 opened its open-air museum featuring 19th century city life, it was named Wadk√∂ping.

She was outfitted as a gunboat with powerful 20-pounder rifled guns and 32-pounder cannon and was assigned to the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America.  Commissioned in New York City in 1861  USS Santiago de Cuba was a wooden, brigantine-rigged, side-wheel steamship built in 1861 at Brooklyn, New York. She was purchased by the Navy on 6 September 1861 at New York City; and was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 5 November 1861, Commander Daniel B. Ridgely in command.  Civil War service  = Gulf of Mexico operations = The new steamer was ordered to Havana, Cuba, > ... to protect legitimate commerce and to suppress communications and > traffic with or by the insurgents ... She reached Havana on 17 November. On 3 December, she captured British blockade runner schooner, Victoria, at sea some 90 miles west of Point Isabel, Texas, and sent the prize to Galveston, Texas. Four days later, she chased and overtook British schooner, Eugenia Smith, but released her for want of evidence justifying a seizure. Thus, she began a career which kept her at sea during much of the Civil War. Santiago de Cuba scored next on 26 April 1862 when she took schooner, Mersey, of Charleston, South Carolina; and she captured schooner, Maria, on the 30th off Port Royal, South Carolina. Schooner, Lucy C. Holmes, laden with cotton, fell into her clutches on 27 May, and the Union side wheeler seized blockade runners, Columbia on 3 August and Lavinia on the 27th‚Äîboth off Abaco in the Bahamas. = Searching for commerce raiders and blockade runners = In September, Santiago de Cuba was assigned to a newly organized \\"Flying Squadron,\\" created to seek out and capture Confederate commerce raiders Alabama and Florida. The squadron caught several prizes but never found the elusive Southern warships. On 21 June 1863, Santiago de Cuba overtook Victory off Palmetto Point, Eleuthera Island, ending a long chase after the British steamer had slipped through the blockade off Charleston with a cargo of cotton, tobacco, and turpentine. On the 25th, she took steamer, Britannia, in the same area. On 15 July, she boarded steamer, Lizzie, east of the Florida coast and sent the prize to Key West, Florida for trial. Late in the year, Santiago de Cuba sailed north for repairs and decommissioned on 30 December 1863. = North Atlantic blockade operations = Overhaul completed, the side wheeler recommissioned on 6 June 1864 and resumed her chase. Some three months later, Santiago de Cuba took A. D. Vance at sea northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina attempting to carry a cargo of cotton to Europe. On 2 November 1864, blockade runner steamer, Lucy, struck her colors in compliance with a demand from Santiago de Cuba. Soon thereafter, the steamer began preparation for a new experience. She was assigned to the task force in which Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter attacked Fort Fisher on Christmas Eve, 1864. During the operation, she protected the landing troops as they went ashore, supported them during the fighting, and covered them as they reluctantly reembarked the next day, under orders of General Benjamin F. Butler, the army commander. Porter immediately began work organizing a new invasion force. The union warships and Army transports returned to the vicinity of Wilmington in mid-January 1865. After a bloody three-day fight, Fort Fisher fell on the 15th. The next day, Santiago de Cuba embarked men wounded in the battle and sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. Medals of Honor During the Civil War, the following crewmen of the USS Santiago de Cuba were awarded the Medal of Honor: * Philip Bazaar, Ordinary Seaman, U.S. Navy * John Griffiths, Captain of the Forecastle, U.S. Navy * George Province, Ordinary Seaman, U.S. Navy * Auzella Savage, Ordinary Seaman, U.S. Navy * John Swanson, Seaman, U.S. Navy * Edward Swatton, Seaman, U.S. Navy * Augustus Williams, Seaman, U.S. Navy  Decommissioning and subsequent career  Before the war ended, Santiago de Cuba was the steamship that took Captain Robert Anderson (Civil War) and John George Nicolay, Private Secretary to President Lincoln, down to Cuba and then to Charleston, SC for the ceremonial re-raising of the flag at Ft Sumter on Friday, April 14, 1865. This ceremony was intended to celebrate the ending of the civil war and be the event that would be remembered at the conclusion of the American Civil War. It is Lincoln's assassination on that date that history remembers. Since the war had ended, Santiago de Cuba was decommissioned on 17 June 1865 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was sold at public auction in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 21 September 1865. She was redocumented on 16 November 1865. For more than two decades, she operated in mercantile service. On 7 December 1886, her engines were removed, and she was rigged as a schooner. Records of her subsequent career have disappeared.

Originally a blue-eyed soul singer, he switched to contemporary Christian music in the late-1980s. Gibson scored a number of hit singles, including \\"Jesus Loves Ya\\" (which spent a then-record 11 weeks at No. 1 on the CCM charts in 1991), \\"Love Come Down\\" (1990) and \\"Friend in You\\" (1988). Gibson's Jesus Loves Ya was ranked No. 90 on CCM Magazines The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music, while the title track charted at No. 52 on the Top 100 Christian AC in 1991. According to Frontline Records and Gibson's websites, he has at least 22 CCM hit songs and 9 No. 1 songs.  Early life  Born in San Francisco, Gibson grew up in San Jose, California, returning to San Francisco as a teenager. He joined the United States Army at age 18 (serving in Germany in the 3rd Infantry Division) and discovered a knack for songwriting. Upon returning home to pursue a music career with his local band in the early 1980s, Gibson found his father had become a Christian. Gibson accepted Christ and, after attending church as a result of his dad's pestering, was baptized by his father in the bathtub.  Music career  After Gibson got out of the army at age 20, he signed with Dick Griffey's Constellation Records (SOLAR) as a rhythm and blues artist. His debut as a singer and songwriter came as a guest vocalist and songwriter on several songs for The Jacksons' keyboardist, Bill Wolfer's project entitled Wolf (on the Constellation label). The album included Michael Jackson singing background vocals on the Gibson/Wolfer collaboration \\"So Shy\\". Griffey circulated Gibson's demo tape, with people believing they were listening to Stevie Wonder (who Gibson sang \\"Ebony and Ivory\\" with while on tour in 1983). Gibson released his debut album Standing on the One (1983) with Constellation and produced the 1983 single \\"She Told Me So\\" via Elektra Records (including a music video that premiered on MTV). Gibson, however, being torn between his desire for pop stardom and his need to give testimony to his faith, entered the Christian music industry when he signed with Frontline Records in 1986. Gibson's second album On the Run (1986) was well received, rendering his first No. 1 single in Contemporary Christian music on Christian radio, entitled \\"God Loves a Broken Heart\\". It became the first of a string of over 20 Top Ten CCM Hits. Gibson also experienced success with the No. 1 single \\"Friend in You\\", a ballad which is one of CCM's classic hit songs, from Change of Heart. On this album, he did a cover of \\"Yah Mo B There\\", a song originally performed by James Ingram and Michael McDonald, and co-written by Rod Temperton and Quincy Jones. Although his first rap solo was 1986's \\"Ain't It Pretty\\" from the album On the Run, Gibson wrote and produced the first rap hit in CCM history (by anyone) called \\"The Wall\\" featuring M.C. Hammer (it was originally within the lyrics of this song that Stanley Kirk Burrell - or \\"K.B.\\" - first identified himself as M.C. Hammer and Gibson as \\"J.G.\\"). Prior to this time, he was a part of Hammer's gospel rap group Holy Ghost Boys, with songs having been produced before being released on their respective albums. For instance, Hammer would later release a song called \\"Son of the King\\" on his debut album Feel My Power (1986) and Gibson released \\"The Wall\\" on his Change of Heart album (1988). Burrell, along with Tramaine Hawkins, previously performed with Gibson's band doing several concerts in various halls such as the Beverly Theatre in Beverly Hills. Gibson was reunited with Stevie Wonder on the 1989 album Body & Soul, with Wonder playing harmonica on a remake of his own song called \\"Have a Talk with God\\" (from 1976's Songs in the Key of Life). Wonder's 1991 soundtrack album Jungle Fever would go on to have Gibson singing backup in return (such as on the track \\"I Go Sailing\\"), even touring together. Gene Andrusco, Rick Zunigar and Rob Watson assisted on the album Jesus Loves Ya (1990), which had two hit singles‚Äîthe title track and the song \\"Love Come Down\\". But there were several elements that frustrated the relationship between Gibson and Frontline Records. The main issue was the fact that through the years Gibson was receiving little if no payment for his recordings. \\"My contract was over when I completed the album Forever Friends\\", Gibson says. In the end, Frontline Records ran into serious financial trouble and Gibson decided to create his own record label, resulting in a nearly three-year hiatus before his next disc, Love Education (peaking at No. 19). Afterward he signed with Ojo Taylor and Gene Eugene of Brainstorm Artists International. Gibson then got married, had children, and took time off from his music again. Upon returning, he searched for a record contract for two years, finally landing with gospel record label B-Rite Music in 1999 for his The Man Inside record, a consciously urban-sounding album made with producer Tommy Sims. It didn't fare as well as previous records, and Gibson again decided to take his career into his own hands, creating his own Imagery Records and releasing his first praise album, Soulful Hymns, in 2002. In 2009, Gibson recorded his 10th solo album, The Horizons of Knowing, with plans for release in late November or early December 2010. However, the album was never released. On June 7, 2010, Gibson released the single \\"On a Mission\\" which was available as a download. Eventually, the song \\"I'm on a Mission\\" was included on his 2012 album The Storyteller (a tribute album to his father Stan Gibson who led Jon to the Christian faith in 1981). A portion of the funding for the album was raised via Kickstarter. It was released on an independent record label by Soul Scan Music and mixed by engineer Dennis Moody.  Musical style and training  Gibson writes, arranges, and produces most of his albums, and plays most of the instruments. Comments Gibson, \\"I'm not a trained musician. I never took music in school. I dropped out of school in 9th grade. I don't know how to read and write notes. I don't play with any proper technique; I just grab instruments and play them. Everything I learned to play, I figured out myself. So I'm not the best musician, but if you give me time, without people coming around, pressuring me ('We have to finish this record by the GMA') when I don't have these pressures on me, I can do tracks closer to the feeling I really want if I play it myself. It takes me longer, but I get more of the feeling I really want if I play it myself.\\" Gibson employs an eclectic soul band called The Groove Masters. In 2005, Prince hired Gibson's band for his Golden Globe Award house party, collaborating with Justin Timberlake, Herbie Hancock, Maroon 5 and Matthew McConaughey. His voice has been compared to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Donny Hathaway.  Personal life  Gibson married Lisa Rea in 1995. They have three children together: Jonathon Thomas Gibson, James Robert Gibson and Jesse Earl Gibson. Gibson became a licensed minister after his youngest son was born on Christmas day in 2004. Gibson leads worship services across the nation and performs for multi-genre, mainstream audiences/celebrities worldwide. He's also a music minister at a California church and a former music director of CSN Radio (KAWZ). Additionally, Gibson is the former Program Director and Network Manager of Effect Radio, a network of sixty-three Christian music radio stations across the U.S. He is working on his 11th solo album to be released in 2020.

Reichenau, early 9th century (ca.820‚Äì830). Ms. 1092. Parchment, 1 folio, ca. 112cm x 77.5 cm. Latin. The Plan of Saint Gall is a medieval architectural drawing of a monastic compound dating from 820‚Äì830 AD. It depicts an entire Benedictine monastic compound, including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and a special house for bloodletting. According to calculations based on the manuscript's tituli the complex was meant to house about 110 monks, 115 lay visitors, and 150 craftmen and agricultural workers. The Plan was never actually built,The abbey church of the medieval period has been excavated in 1964‚Äì66, but its form does not reflect that on the plan. Excavations were reported in Horn, The Plan of St. Gall, vol. 2, pp. 256‚Äì359. and was so named because it is dedicated to Gozbert abbot of Saint Gall. The planned church was intended to keep the relics of Saint Gall. The plan was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the Abbey of St. Gall ‚Äì Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen ‚Äì where it remains to this day (Ms 1092). It is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the 13th century. It is considered a national treasure of Switzerland and remains a significant object of interest among modern scholars, architects, artists and draftspeople for its uniqueness, its beauty, and the insights it provides into medieval culture.  Motivations behind the Plan  There are two main theories concerning the motivations behind the drawing of the Plan. The dispute between scholars centres around the assertion put forward by Horn and Born in their 1979 work The Plan of Saint Gall, that the Plan in the Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen was a copy of an original drawing issued by the court of Louis the Pious after the synods held at Aachen in 816 and 817. The purpose of the synods was to establish Benedictine monasteries throughout the Carolingian Empire as a bulwark against encroaching Christian monastic missionaries from Britain and Ireland who were bringing Celtic lifestyle influences to the Continent (see Celtic art). Horn and Born argued that the Plan was a \\"paradigmatic\\" drawing of how a Benedictine monastery should look if the Benedictine Rule was to be strictly followed; a guide for the construction of future monastic ensembles. Other scholars, particularly Werner Jacobsen, Norbert Stachura and Lawrence Nees have, on the contrary, argued that the Plan is an original drawing made at the Monastery of Reichenau for the abbot of Saint Gall, Gozbert, who decided to build a new abbey church in the 820s. This argument is based on Jacobsen's observations of marks left by pairs of compasses in the parchment, as well as alterations and changes undertaken during its drawing. Lawrence Nees has also argued that the fact that the manuscript was drawn and written by two scribes, a younger one and an elder who acted as a supervisor \\"filling in and completing where the knowledge of the main scribe ended\\", Citing W. Horn. can only be explained if the drawing is an original. Plan of Saint Gall. Verso. Life of Saint Martin. 12th Century. St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. Sang. 1092, f. verso ‚Äì Plan of Saint Gall (https://www.e-codices.ch/en/list/one/csg/1092)  The manuscript  The Plan was created from five parchments sewn together, and measures 45 inches by 31 inches (113 cm by 78 cm). It is drawn with red ink lines for the buildings, and brown ink for lettered inscriptions. The sequence in which the parchment was joined is the following: the first parchment consisted of the drawing of the abbey church and cloister; the second and third parchments were added to the bottom and right side of the original vellum, and here the abbey church was enlarged; buildings were added around the cloister; and the abbot's house, outer school, guest house and pilgrim's house were drawn. A fourth parchment was then added to the top where the infirmary, novitiate, cemetery, orchard, garden were drawn; and finally a fifth parchment was added to the bottom to accommodate the designs for the livestock quarters. About 333 inscriptions, forty of them in meter, in the handwritings of two different scribes, describe the functions of the buildings. It has been possible to attribute the handwriting of these scribes to the monastery of Reichenau and one of them has been identified as monk Reginbert. The scale to which the Plan was drawn has also been a subject of dispute. Horn and Born, for example, argue that a single scale was used while others, such as Reinle and Jacobsen, argue that multiple scales were applied for different elements. The reverse of the Plan was inscribed in the 12th century, after it had been folded into book form, with the Life of Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus. = The Dedication = It is widely held that the Plan was dedicated to Gozbertus, the Abbot of St Gall from 816‚Äì36. However, recently Alfons Zettler has put forward the possibility of it being dedicated to another monk, Gozbert ‚Äì known as young Gozbert ‚Äì also an inhabitant of the monastery of Saint Gall during the same period. The text reads [as translated by Horn into English]: The Latin reads:  Architectural design and structures  Plan of Saint Gall. Simplified view showing different structures. As mentioned above the Plan represents a Benedictine monastery and it is possible to see the Benedictine Rule being applied in the architectural design. One of the main aspects of the Rule was the ascetic life of the monks who had to dedicate themselves to prayer, meditation and study, and not worry about worldly matters. For this purpose, the Benedictine Rule required a monastery which was self-sufficient, and which provided for the monks all the necessary facilities, food, and water. The Plan thus depicts 40 ground plans which include not only the properly monastic buildings (basilica, cloister, abbot's house and cemetery) but also secular buildings for the use of lay workers and visitors. Lynda Coon has identified five distinct \\"spatial-units\\": * Sacred: basilica, round towers, hostel for visiting monks, abbot's house, cemetery and cloister complex. * Lay: elite guest houses, servant quarters, hospice for pilgrims and the poor. * Educational: novitiate and outer school for the elite. * Medicinal: infirmary, physician's house, bloodletting house, herb garden. * Agricultural and artisanal: workshops, animal pens, houses for agrarian workers and gardens. She has also identified a status differentiation in the structures which follow the cardinal points. Accordingly, she argues that the northwest is reserved for the secular elite while the southwest is for the secular lower classes. Regarding the sacred spaces, the northeast and southeast is reserved for the monastic elite, and the far east and far south for what she calls \\"the liminal\\", that is to say in between lay and monastic. Alfons Zettler has recently identified another criterion that the authors of the Plan may have followed for the layout of the structures, which does not follow the cardinal points but is determined by a clockwise direction starting and ending at the abbot's house. He argues that the basis of the organisation would have been a division of public/private and lay/monastic which is represented in the Plan by an increasing lay presence in each sector of the monastery when moving around the cloister clockwise from the infirmary. = The monk's cloister = Monk's cloister. Plan of Saint Gall. Buildings surrounding the cloister clockwise from the top: warming room and dormitory, refectory, vestiary and kitchen, cellar and larder (bottom of the picture). The basilica can be seen to the left of the picture. The monastic cloister occupies the centre of the Plan. It is placed in the southeast aligning itself both with the sacred east and with the poor ‚Äì the accommodation for pilgrims and the poor is placed in the east just beneath the cloister ‚Äì far from the worldly commodities and pleasures of the secular elite. The structure of the cloister is highly symbolic. Firstly, it is a closed space looking inwards to its own centre where a savin tree is placed ‚Äì ‚Äì illustrating the ideal of a monk's experience removed from the world. Secondly, it is foursquare and four paths lead from its covered galleries to the centre ‚Äì ‚Äì symbolising Jerusalem and its four rivers. The cloister is surrounded by two-storied buildings consisting of the warming room and dormitory to the east ‚Äì and ‚Äì the refectory, vestiary and kitchen to the south ‚Äì , and ‚Äì and the cellar and larder to the west ‚Äì and . The monks, as well as the abbot, had a private entrance to the basilica either through their dormitory or through the portico of the cloister. = The abbot's house = Abbot's House. Plan of Sain Gall. See private passageway to Basilica (right of image). The abbot's intermediary position between the clerical and lay worlds is seen in the position of his accommodation on the Plan. The abbot's quarters are located at the other side of the abbey church from the monk's cloister, to the north-east, aligning itself with the secular elite guest houses where the royalty, the emperor and the emperor's court would lodge. The abbot's house also looks over the infirmary and novitiate to the east, the outer school and the house for elite guests to the west. The abbot's house faces outwards, its porticoes opening to the outside world, in opposition with the monk's cloister porticoes which open to an enclosed green space. However, in order to comply with an ascetic way of life and to the Benedictine Rule, the abbot shares his bedroom and privy with seven other monks, and his servant quarters are set apart. Finally, the abbot's residence has a privileged entry to the east-end of the basilica through a private passageway ‚Äì ‚Äì signalling his spiritual status as head of the monastery. Basilica. Plan of Saint Gall. = The basilica = The monastery church or basilica is cruciform in shape and doubled-apsed to the east and to the west. It measures c.91.44 meters from apse to apse, the nave is c.12 meters in width and each aisle is c.6 meters in width. In the west entrance there are two towers dedicated to St. Michael (northern tower) and St. Gabriel (southern tower). The inscriptions on the towers ‚Äì ad universa super inspicienda ‚Äì give them a surveillance function while no indication of bells is given. The entrance to the church is also the only entrance to the whole monastic complex and it is marked by a square porch inscribed: (Here all the arriving crowd will find their entry). From here the visitors are directed to a semi-circular atrium where they are separated to different parts of the monastery depending on their status ‚Äì the elite is directed to the north gate and the pilgrims and lower-classes to the south gate ‚Äì or to the church. The interior of the church is divided by columns and railings which not only direct the lay visitors to their authorised spaces but also block their view of the sacred east where the altar of Saint Mary and Saint Gall is placed. According to Horn and Born only one-sixth of the church is accessible to seculars while five-sixths of it is reserved for the sole use of the monks. Lay guests are only admitted in the side aisles of the church, the area around the baptismal font ‚Äì ‚Äì and the crypt ‚Äì ; the only place in the church where monks and seculars mix to worship at the tomb of Saint Gall. The transept, the presbytery, the nave and the two apses (dedicated to Saint Peter to the west and Saint Paul to the east) being solely for the ascetics' use. The northern and southern aisles of the basilica are furnished with four altars each. The northern aisle houses the altars (from west to east) of Saints Lucia and Cecilia, of the Holy Innocents, of Saint Martin, and of Saint Stephen. The altars on the southern aisle are dedicated (from west to east) to Saints Agatha and Agnes, to Saint Sebastian, to Saint Mauritius, and to Saint Lawrence. The nave opens to the aisles through nine arcades in each side, three of them \\"railed off\\" to prevent the entry of laymen. The main surface of the nave houses the baptismal font, the altar of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, the altar of the Holy Saviour at the Cross and the ambo. The transept is separated from the nave by further screens and railings, in its southern arm is the altar of Saint Andrew and in its northern arm the altar of Saints Philipp and James. From the transcript the monks and lay brothers access the crypt. Finally, at the easternmost of the church is the presbytery with the high altar dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Gall. Derivative works Artist's reconstruction of the buildings in the plan by J. Rudolf Rahn, 1876. =Umberto Eco= According to Earl Anderson (Cleveland State University), it is likely that Umberto Eco references the plan in his novel The Name of the Rose: =Models= The Plan has inspired a tradition of model making. In 1965 Ernest Born and others created a scale model of the plan for the Age of Charlemagne exhibition in Aachen, Germany. This became the inspiration for the book he co-authored in 1979 with Walter Horn, but was also the first in a tradition of modeling the plan. More recently the plan has been modeled on computers using CAD software. It is possible to see the different models in the Saint Gall Project website. = Campus Galli = Campus Galli is a Carolingian monastic community under construction in Me√ükirch, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early 9th-century Plan of Saint Gall using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013. =St. Gall Project= The St. Gall Project was founded to produce a digital online presence for the plan including models and an extensive online database on early medieval monastic culture. The project is directed by Patrick Geary (UCLA) and Bernard Frischer (University of Virginia)\\"Bernard Frischer,\\" official website. with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The website was released to the public in December 2007. Future resources will include intellectual and textual aspects of the plan and monasticism; space for publication of new papers and research, lesson plans and teaching aides, blogs and chat rooms.

The determinant of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials is their resultant, which is zero when the two polynomials have a common root (in case of coefficients in a field) or a non-constant common divisor (in case of coefficients in an integral domain). Sylvester matrices are named after James Joseph Sylvester. Definition Formally, let p and q be two nonzero polynomials, respectively of degree m and n. Thus: :p(z)=p_0+p_1 z+p_2 z^2+\\\\cdots+p_m z^m,\\\\;q(z)=q_0+q_1 z+q_2 z^2+\\\\cdots+q_n z^n. The Sylvester matrix associated to p and q is then the (n+m)\\\\times(n+m) matrix constructed as follows: * if n > 0, the first row is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} p_m & p_{m-1} & \\\\cdots & p_1 & p_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. * the second row is the first row, shifted one column to the right; the first element of the row is zero. * the following n ‚àí 2 rows are obtained the same way, shifting the coefficients one column to the right each time and setting the other entries in the row to be 0. * if m > 0 the (n + 1)th row is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} q_n & q_{n-1} & \\\\cdots & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. * the following rows are obtained the same way as before. Thus, if m = 4 and n = 3, the matrix is: :S_{p,q}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. If one of the degrees is zero (that is the corresponding polynomial is a nonzero constant), then there are zero rows consisting of coefficients of the other polynomial, and the Sylvester matrix is a diagonal matrix of dimension the degree of the non-constant polynomial, with the all diagonal coefficients equal to the constant polynomial. If m = n = 0, then the Sylvester matrix is the empty matrix with zero rows and zero columns. A variant The above defined Sylvester matrix appears in a Sylvester paper of 1840. In a paper of 1853, Sylvester introduced the following matrix, which is, up to a permutation of the rows, the Sylvester matrix of p and q, which are both considered as having degree max(m, n).Akritas, A.G., Malaschonok, G.I., Vigklas, P.S.:Sturm Sequences and Modified Subresultant Polynomial Remainder Sequences. Serdica Journal of Computing, Vol. 8, No 1, 29--46, 2014 This is thus a 2\\\\,\\\\max(n, m)\\\\times 2\\\\,\\\\max(n, m)-matrix containing \\\\max(n, m) pairs of rows. Assuming m > n, it is obtained as follows: * the first pair is: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} p_m & p_{m-1} &\\\\cdots & p_n & \\\\cdots & p_1 & p_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & q_n & \\\\cdots & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. * the second pair is the first pair, shifted one column to the right; the first elements in the two rows are zero. * the remaining max(n, m)-2 pairs of rows are obtained the same way as above. Thus, if m = 4 and n = 3, the matrix is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & p_4 & p_3 & p_2 & p_1 & p_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & q_3 & q_2 & q_1 & q_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. The determinant of the 1853 matrix is, up to sign, the product of the determinant of the Sylvester matrix (which is called the resultant of p and q) by p_m^{m-n} (still supposing m\\\\ge n). Applications These matrices are used in commutative algebra, e.g. to test if two polynomials have a (non constant) common factor. In such a case, the determinant of the associated Sylvester matrix (which is named the resultant of the two polynomials) equals zero. The converse is also true. The solutions of the simultaneous linear equations :{S_{p,q}}^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\\\\\\\\\y\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} where x is a vector of size n and y has size m, comprise the coefficient vectors of those and only those pairs x, y of polynomials (of degrees n-1 and m-1, respectively) which fulfill :x(z) \\\\cdot p(z) + y(z) \\\\cdot q(z) = 0, where polynomial multiplication and addition is used. This means the kernel of the transposed Sylvester matrix gives all solutions of the B√©zout equation where \\\\deg x < \\\\deg q and \\\\deg y < \\\\deg p. Consequently the rank of the Sylvester matrix determines the degree of the greatest common divisor of p and q: :\\\\deg(\\\\gcd(p,q)) = m+n-\\\\operatorname{rank} S_{p,q} Moreover, the coefficients of this greatest common divisor may be expressed as determinants of submatrices of the Sylvester matrix (see Subresultant).

It can be crewed by one or two children or an adult. Current models come equipped with both a mainsail and a jib, the jib however mainly functions as a training tool and provides little to no contribution to speed. The Pico functions mainly as a training boat for younger children because of its very durable nature and has little to no racing events dedicated to it. A sport version is also available on this boat which includes a larger Mylar sail and upgraded control lines. This improvement changed the Portsmouth Yardstick from 1338 to 1269 (for the double handed setup). This version is used extensively in the one- design race series. The hull is of thermoplastic sandwich construction, providing strength, stiffness, and built-in buoyancy. The cockpit is self- draining. The boat comes equipped with an aluminum two-piece mast, an aluminum boom, and a lifting rudder. For the more racy type, the pico can have a battened race sail attached instead of the cruising main. This sail is made of mylar and is much tougher and more powerful than its cruising counterpart. Laser Performance, the manufacturer of the Pico, has sold over 15,000 of these boats.

Design and development In 1938, George A. Page, head of the Saint Louis Airplane Division of Curtiss-Wright, decided to develop a fighter aircraft based on Carl W. Scott's two seater Model 19. Page's concept was a lightweight fighter interceptor with as high a rate of climb as possible in order to allow bomber formations to be attacked with minimal warning. If faced with fighter opposition, it was intended not to dogfight, but to use its superior climb rate to escape.Casius 1981, pp. 33‚Äì34. While this was a direct contradiction to the United States Army Air Corps‚Ä≤ requirements for fighters (which stressed low-level performance), this did not concern Page, since the new fighter was intended for export.Casius 1981, p. 34.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 153‚Äì154. Detailed design of the new fighter, the Model 21, or CW-21, was carried out by a team led by chief engineer Willis Wells. It was a single-seat, all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with retractable tailwheel landing gear, where the mainwheels retracted rearwards into fairings under the wing. The fuselage was a semi-monocoque structure that tapered sharply behind the pilot's cockpit. It was powered by a Wright R-1820-G5 nine-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. It was designed to carry various combinations of two or machine guns, mounted in the nose and synchronized to fire through the propeller, while no armor or fuel tank protection was fitted in order to save weight and hence improve performance. The prototype first flew on 22 September 1938, carrying the civil experimental registration NX19431. Although the CW-21 was not commissioned by the U.S. military, it was test flown at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. The Army Air Corps immediately rejected the aircraft, with one officer commenting that it took a genius to land it.Edwards 1992 Operational history ML-KNIL Curtiss CW-21B lineup in 1941 The prototype CW-21 was delivered to China for evaluation by the Chinese Air Force. The Chinese were impressed by the CW-21's performance, and negotiation started on a Chinese purchase. While these negotiations were ongoing, the CW-21 prototype was flown in combat against Japanese bombers attacking Chungking, with Curtiss test pilot Bob Fausel claiming a Fiat BR.20 bomber shot down on 4 April 1939. In May 1939, a contract was signed, with China receiving the prototype and three complete examples built by Curtiss, as well as kits for 27 more aircraft. Assembly would be undertaken by the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) at Loiwing, near the China-Burma border. These were to be armed with two and two machine guns.Casius 1981, pp. 34‚Äì35. The three Curtiss-built aircraft were shipped to China in May 1940 and were eventually handed over to the 1st American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers), who intended to use them to tackle high-flying Japanese reconnaissance aircraft.Casius 1981, p. 36. These crashed and were destroyed, due to poor visibility, on a flight from Rangoon to Kunming on 23 December 1941.Ford 2007, pp. 124‚Äì125. Of the 27 to be assembled by CAMCO, none were completed before CAMCO was forced by advancing Japanese forces to evacuate its Loiwing factory to India in 1942.Andersson 2008, p. 260. Curtiss had meanwhile developed an improved version of the CW-21, the CW-21B. The main difference was a new undercarriage with inward- retracting mainwheels and a semi-retractable tail wheel which had been developed for the Curtiss-Wright CW-23 armed trainer, with other changes including hydraulically operated flaps. Although heavier, the CW-21B was faster than the original CW-21, albeit with a reduced rate of climb.Casius 1981, pp. 36‚Äì37. In April 1940, the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade Luchtvaartbrigade, desperate for modern combat aircraft, placed an order for 24 CW-21Bs from Curtiss-Wright. After the Battle of the Netherlands, which resulted in the Dutch Army surrendering to the invading Germans on 15 May 1940, the order for the CW-21Bs (together with a number of Curtiss Model 75 fighters and Curtiss-Wright CW-22 trainers), was transferred to the government of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), for the Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger (\\"Military Aviation of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army\\"; ML-KNIL).Casius 1981, p. 37. The 24 CW-21Bs were assembled at Andir airfield, Bandung, Java, in February 1941, equipping Vliegtuiggroep IV, Afdeling 2 (\\"Air Group IV, No. 2 Squadron\\"; 2-VLG IV). The lightweight construction of the Curtiss-Wrights gave rise to structural problems, and several aircraft were grounded by cracks in the undercarriage, and were still awaiting repair when war with Japan began on 8 December 1941.Casius 1981, pp. 38‚Äì39. With its light construction, radial engine, low wing loading, limited pilot protection and lack of self-sealing fuel tanks, the CW-21B was the Allied fighter most similar to the opposing Japanese fighters. It had a rate of climb superior to the Nakajima Ki-43-I (\\"Oscar\\") and Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero. The CW-21B had similar firepower to the \\"Oscar\\", but worse than the cannon-armed Zero. 2-VLG IV claimed four aerial victories during the Netherlands East Indies campaign, but the ML-KNIL was overwhelmed by the sheer number of Japanese aircraft; almost all of its fighters were soon lost in combat or destroyed on the ground.

It was developed in the early 1930s by Emil Bergmann (son of Theodor Bergmann) and manufactured at the Bergmann company in Suhl (that also built one of the first submachine guns, the MP 18). History The forerunner of the MP35 was the MP32 that Danish company Schultz & Larsen produced (under licence from the Bergmann company) and which was chambered for 9√ó23mm Bergmann ammunition. The BMP32 design was later updated by the Bergmann factory and in 1934, the Bergmann MP34 submachine gun appeared (not to be confused with different Steyr MP34). The limited manufacturing capabilities at the Bergmann plant required production to be shifted to Carl Walther's Zella-Mehlis plant. This German company produced some 2,000 BMP34s for export and domestic sales. Several variants of the BMP34 were manufactured with a 200mm standard or 320mm barrel. During 1935, a simplified version of the BMP34 designated as Bergmann MP35/I appeared. Initial production orders for MP35 were also placed at Walther, which made about 5,000 SMGs between 1936 and 1940. With the outbreak of World War II, production once again shifted from Walter to Junker & Ruh (manufacture code 'ajf') to manufacture the MP35 weapon (which it did through to 1944). During the war, about 40,000 Bergmann submachine guns were produced by Junker, and almost all were supplied to the Waffen-SS. Operation The MP35 was a blowback operated, selective fire SMG which fired from an open bolt. The weapon featured a non-reciprocating cocking handle placed at the rear of the receiver, which was operated in a similar fashion to bolt-action on a Mauser rifle. This involved the weapon carrier to manually pull the handle up, pull backwards, push forwards and lock back down. When the gun was then fired the cocking handle remained stationary. On the BMP32 the weapon featured a safety at the rear of the bolt (again in a similar location to the Mauser rifle). On both BMP34 and MP35 the safety was relocated to the left side of the receiver. The shooter could select the mode of firing by applying different pressure to the trigger ‚Äì a short pull fired single shots; a long pull resulted in full automatic fire. Feed was from the right side of the gun, for some mysterious reason, with ejection to the left. In contrast to many other SMGs of the time the MP35's magazine was inserted from the right-hand side of the weapon. Early versions used proprietary magazines, the BMP35 used Schmeisser MP28-compatible magazines. The barrel was enclosed into tubular jacket with cooling slots and muzzle brake/compensator at the front. Service It was first known as the MP32 when adopted as such by the Danish Army in caliber 9√ó23mm Bergmann then as the MP34 (this not the same as the MP34 made by Steyr) when it was adopted by the Belgian Army as the Mitraillette 34. It was adopted officially as MP35 by the Wehrmacht. It saw action predominantly with SS troops. In Yugoslavia, both the Partisans and the Chetniks used captured ex-German MP35s. The MP35 was exported to Bolivia, Ethiopia, Spain and Sweden (where it was designated the number M39).

It has also been published in English under the name Bridges or Chopsticks (based on a mistranslation: the hashi of the title, Ê©ã, means bridge; hashi written with another character, ÁÆ∏, means chopsticks). It has also appeared in The Times under the name Hashi. In France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium it is published under the name Ai-Ki-Ai.  Rules  Hashiwokakero is played on a rectangular grid with no standard size, although the grid itself is not usually drawn. Some cells start out with (usually encircled) numbers from 1 to 8 inclusive; these are the \\"islands\\". The rest of the cells are empty. The goal is to connect all of the islands by drawing a series of bridges between the islands. The bridges must follow certain criteria:. * They must begin and end at distinct islands, travelling a straight line in between. * They must not cross any other bridges or islands. * They may only run orthogonally (i.e. they may not run diagonally). * At most two bridges connect a pair of islands. * The number of bridges connected to each island must match the number on that island. * The bridges must connect the islands into a single connected group. Solution methods solution) Solving a Hashiwokakero puzzle is a matter of procedural force: having determined where a bridge must be placed, placing it there can eliminate other possible places for bridges, forcing the placement of another bridge, and so on. An island showing '3' in a corner, '5' along the outside edge, or '7' anywhere must have at least one bridge radiating from it in each valid direction, for if one direction did not have a bridge, even if all other directions sported two bridges, not enough will have been placed. Obviously, a '4' in a corner, '6' along the border, or '8' anywhere must have two bridges in each direction. This can be generalized as added bridges obstruct routes: a '3' that can only be travelled from vertically must have at least one bridge each for up and down, for example. It is common practice to cross off or fill in islands whose bridge quota has been reached. In addition to reducing mistakes, this can also help locate potential \\"short circuits\\": keeping in mind that all islands must be connected by one network of bridges, a bridge that would create a closed network that no further bridges could be added to can only be permitted if it immediately yields the solution to the complete puzzle. The simplest example of this is two islands showing '1' aligned with each other; unless they are the only two islands in the puzzle, they cannot be connected by a bridge, as that would complete a network that cannot be added to, and would therefore force those two islands to be unreachable by any others. Any bridge that would completely isolate a group of islands from another group would not be permitted, as one would then have two groups of islands that could not connect. This deduction, however, is not very commonly seen in Hashiwokakero puzzles. Determining whether a Hashiwokakero puzzle has a solution is NP-complete, by a reduction from finding Hamiltonian cycles in integer-coordinate unit distance graphs.. There is a solution using integer linear programming in the MathProg examples included in GLPK.. A library of puzzles counting up to 400 islands as well as integer linear programming results are also reported..

Tim Hitchner July 2006 Brocket 99 was a comedy audio tape that parodied aboriginal people in Canada. It has been described as a \\"phenomenon\\" by some, and racist by others. 1986 tape The premise of the Brocket 99 tape was that of a fictitious radio station broadcasting from Brocket, Alberta, on the Northern Peigan reserve (a real First Nations reservation 70 km west of Lethbridge, Alberta), hosted by a character named \\"Ernie Scar\\" and featuring other participants. The tape falsely stereotypes Canadian First Nations peoples through the use of pejorative, bigoted and racist terms as habitual users of alcohol, drugs and welfare, engaging in anti-social behavior and low in intelligence. The content of the tape is a mixture of music, advertisements, news, sports, interviews and local announcements divided into two parts corresponding to the two sides of a cassette tape in common use at the time. Music played on the tape included complete versions from AC/DC, Hank Williams Jr., The Romantics, Paul Revere & the Raiders, John Anderson, Doctor and the Medics and Dwight Yoakam, although AC/DC is the most used artist throughout the tape. Advertisements on the tape were either original creations interspersed with vulgarity, racism and stereotypical language for real products such as for Lysol, or taken from legitimately produced radio commercials for companies such as Safeway, Penner's Men's and Women's Wear in Taber, Alberta and Beaver Lumber. News, sports, interviews and local announcements on the tape are largely original creations interspersed with factual entities such as the Seattle Seahawks and Toronto Blue Jays as well as non-existent entities such as \\"Brocket Used Motors\\" and \\"Brocket Alcohol & Drug Abuse Hotline\\" created specifically for the tape. It is unconfirmed though realistically impossible that any of the music or produced or original advertising content for any of the businesses referred to in the tape would have authorized their use during the production of the tape, owing to the stereotypical and racist content used by the tape's creators. The tape was created in 1986 by Tim Hitchner, a radio DJ in Lethbridge, Alberta as a parody and not intended to be marketed. . Hitchner worked as a radio DJ at CHEC, CKTA, and CKIZ-FM from 1985 to 1992. It is claimed that Hitchner was inspired to create Brocket 99 based on another underground tape circulating in 1986 called \\"AIDS Radio\\" that was a spoof of a homosexual radio station using stereotypical and bigoted references. The initial method of distribution from Tim Hitchner has not been documented, although its wider distribution has been described as viral. The tape has been described as an \\"international underground phenomenon\\". Hitchner died February 12, 2011. On February 12, 2011, a fan site reported the then anonymous actor who played Ernie Scar had died at age 49, of myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease. CKIZ's list of past employees on its website currently identifies Hitchner as the voice of Ernie Scar.  Documentary film  In 2005, filmmaker Nilesh Patel produced and directed a documentary called Brocket 99 ‚Äî Rockin' the Country, which examined the ongoing popularity of the tape and the relationship between aboriginal people and others in Canada. The film won the S√©quences Magazine Prize for best documentary film at the 2006 Montreal First Peoples Festival. In 2004, prior to the release of the documentary, Mark Campbell of Global News interviewed Nilesh Patel to discuss the creation and subject matter of the documentary. In addition to discussing prevailing Canadian attitudes on race and culture in the context of the documentary, Nilesh Patel also made an unsubstantiated claim during the interview that Mark Campbell was in denial of being the creator of Brocket 99. Contrary to this claim, no evidence has ever been presented implicating any individual other than Tim Hitchner in the creation of or participation in Brocket 99. On February 15, 2015, Mark Campbell wrote a blog post confirming again that he was neither the creator of nor a participant in Brocket 99.

Stevie Moore or RSM, is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter who pioneered lo-fi/DIY music. Often called the \\"godfather of home recording\\", he is one of the most recognized artists of the cassette underground, and his influence is particularly felt in the bedroom and hypnagogic pop artists of the post-millennium. Since 1968, he has self-released approximately 400 albums, while about three dozen \\"official\\" albums (largely compilations) have been issued on various labels. Born the son of Nashville A-Team bassist Bob Moore, Steven grew up in the 1960s listening to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Mothers of Invention, and Jimi Hendrix. On his 16th birthday, he received a four-track reel-to-reel tape deck and began recording as a one-man band in his parents' basement in suburban Madison, Tennessee. The innovative manipulation of low fidelity recording processes in his early albums defined his general aesthetic. With help from his uncle, he made his official label debut with 1976's Phonography, which was well-received in New York's punk and new wave circles. Although he is best known for \\"'60s-inspired power pop in the XTC vein,\\" his body of work incorporates a variety of music genres, both popular and experimental, and his records are typically styled after freeform radio. He describes his prolific output as \\"a diary of sound\\". From 1978 until 2010, Moore lived and recorded in his apartment studios in northern New Jersey. He was also a WFMU staff member for a number of years. In 1982, he launched the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, his home-based mailing service. Throughout the 1980s, the French label New Rose released a series of Moore albums: Everything (1984), Glad Music (1986), Teenage Spectacular (1987), and Warning (1988). After the 2000s, he became better known for his associations with Ariel Pink, who frequently praised Moore as his \\"mentor\\". 1952‚Äì1978: Madison period =Early life and influences= Robert Steven Moore was born in Nashville, Tennessee on January 18, 1952. His father, Bob Moore (born 1932), was a session musician associated with the Nashville A-Team conglomerate who worked as a bassist for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan. Steven characterized his father as a \\"terrible\\" parent and said that \\"It was a very intense, dramatic, abusive childhood, with all this money coming in, because he‚Äôs doing these amazing historical sessions. It‚Äôs very, very sad. He was very disappointed in me because I was not a get-up-and-go type.\\" At the age of seven, Steven made his commercial recording debut singing a duet with country recording artist Jim Reeves, \\"But You Love Me, Daddy\\". The novelty song was withheld from commercial release until 1969, when it became a hit single in the UK on the RCA Victor label. Moore's mother Betty was from Paterson, New Jersey. As a teenager, Moore became proficient on guitar, bass, piano, and drums. He was self-taught. In 1966, he and a few high-school friends formed a short-lived rock combo called the Marlborough. His recordings in this period were heavily influenced by the Mothers of Invention's albums Freak Out! (1966) and We're Only in It for the Money (1967). He found particular inspiration from albums that are \\"just all over the map ‚Ä¶ Zappa leaned into parody, and I‚Äôm all about that. I love humor.\\" On his 16th birthday, he received a four-track reel-to-reel tape deck and began recording as a one-man band set up in his parents' basement in suburban Madison. The first album he completed and self-released was a mixture of Beatles-inspired songs and sound collages titled On Graycroft (1968). Much of his output, he later said, was \\"uncontrollable‚Äîcompelled without compulsion. I didn't seek out to do this. It just came out of me. I had this music inside of me and I wanted to be a pop star. It was like a disease that I had to record and write.\\" Over the years he would describe himself as \\"a huge record collector and music historian\\" with interests ranging from beatnik and avant-garde to noise and jazz: \\"I love attempts at all genres and styles ‚Äì even if I fail. It doesn‚Äôt matter.\\" Moore began working as a studio musician and assistant at his father's music publishing company, Mimosa Music. His father expected him to \\"follow in his footsteps, to become a wealthy country session picker. My personal interests couldn't have been more opposite than that.\\" He briefly attended Vanderbilt University, but dropped out in 1971 to pursue his passions for writing, recording and performing music. That same year, he moved out of his parent's house and rented an apartment at the Music Row area in Nashville. He formed a close friendship with next-door neighbor Victor Lovera, who he called \\"one of my best friends and ... very influential for my songwriting.\\" Throughout the early 1970s, Moore continued to play local shows with a group of high-school friends whose band name changed frequently. His music tastes‚Äîwhich mainly encompassed artists like the Beach Boys, the Move, Frank Zappa, and Todd Rundgren‚Äîwere mostly out of step with the prevailing music culture in Nashville. In 1973, Moore, Lovera, and friends Roger Ferguson and Billy Anderson recorded original material at the local Audio Media recording studio under the band name \\"Ethos\\", which was left unreleased at the time. Engineer Paul Whitehead remembered of those sessions: \\"Moore [would] perform on ANY instrument with total control and an energy that I have never witnessed in a studio. I thought the world of Victor's unique vocal sound and thought the two of them would be wildly successful, but as I told them they would have to move to New York to even get noticed.\\" =Phonography= In 1975, Moore was commissioned by his uncle Harry \\"H.P.\\" Palmer (an executive of Atco Records) to record an album of Beatles instrumentals, Stevie Does the Beatles, but plans for an official release fell through. Palmer continued to encourage Moore to put his music out, and in 1976, Phonography was Moore's first album to be released on an outside label (Palmer's HP Music). Technically a compilation, the LP was assembled by Palmer using material from Moore's previous two years of home recording, with its contents split between pop songs and spoken-word interludes. Its initial run was limited to 100 pressings. Phonography was reviewed in New York's Trouser Press as \\"an outrageous collection of musical brain spewage\\" and \\"a true slash of genius\\". Moore credits the review's author, Ira Robbins, as \\"the one who helped turn people on to Phonography and those early independent records.\\" The album soon attracted praise from within New York's punk and new wave circles. HP Music followed up with the EP Stance (recorded 1976‚Äì77) and the LP Delicate Tension (recorded 1976‚Äì78), both released 1978. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork wrote that Phonography and other albums from this time ultimately \\"defined his aesthetic: a mixture of Anglo-powered pop, Zappa-esque instrumentals, lo-fi experimental sound design, and other music that defies categorization.\\" Phonography later became the best-known album of his career and was listed among \\"the fifty most significant indie records\\" in Rolling Stones Alt-Rock-A- Rama (1996). 1978‚Äì2010: New Jersey period In February 1978, Moore relocated to Montclair, New Jersey and got a job working at a Sam Goody record store in Livingston, where he remained for many years. According to him, although he lived 13 miles away from the Lincoln Tunnel in the proceeding decades, he rarely ever traveled into New York City. He said he arrived in New Jersey \\"right when punk was hitting, and I was an instant celebrity. I bleached my hair and I spiked it out, and I was Johnny Rotten from hillbilly land. It was so innocent then, total lo-fi.\\" Over the decade, he made sporadic appearances on the public access television variety show The Uncle Floyd Show. He was also a staff member on the New Jersey-based independent radio station WFMU, where he hosted a weekly \\"Bedroom Radio\\" show for about \\"four or five years\\" and claimed to be \\"one of the first that did radio shows that would play Wagner, then The Sex Pistols, then hillbilly, then great funk.\\" Moore later reflected on this period: \\"I'm not a nightlife person. I should have really planted myself on the streets and plugged away, but I'm not a very good salesman so I never thought of going down and trying to convince people to sign me. It was a struggle. ... Through the 80s, my uncle was hoping I‚Äôd get a band together, but I had no idea how to do it.\\" In late 1979, he used an eight-track Manhattan studio to record Clack! (1980), named for the studio's owner Tom Clack. It was Moore's first album recorded in a professional studio. At this point, he was heavily influenced by Public Image Ltd: \\"[they] changed my life! That whole postpunk thing, minimalist dub, drums and bass. It almost sounds like fragments, not finished songs. I loved that music.\\" The album also marked the beginning of Moore's \\"post-punk era\\", which lasted until 1983's Crises. In the early 1980s, the tracks \\"Bloody Knuckles\\" and \\"Chantilly Lace\\" from Clack! saw some college radio airplay. WFMU's Irwin Chusid also performed with Moore as a drummer and compiled the What's The Point?!! (1984), the first record issued on the label Cuneiform. In 1982, he launched the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, a mail-order service that issued his recordings on cassette. He acknowledged the number of albums he made available: \\"People tell me I'm shooting myself in the foot, releasing so much ‚Äî I've heard that for years. But I can't help it. It's who I am.\\" Music critic Richie Unterberger, in an essay about the developing cassette culture, wrote that he subsequently became \\"one of the most famous\\" artists associated with the movement. Between 1984 and 1988, the French label New Rose issued four of his albums on vinyl, starting with Everything You Always Wanted to Know About R. Stevie Moore (But Were Afraid to Ask). The album, a double-disc retrospective, proved briefly popular in France, with a single \\"Chantilly Lace\\" from the album becoming a minor sleeper hit there, and prompting Moore to undertake a promotional visit to the country. The remaining albums‚ÄîGlad Music (1986), Teenage Spectacular (1987), and Warning: R. Stevie Moore (1988)‚Äîwere mostly recorded using professional studios. Moore continued to produce music and play gigs throughout the 1990s and 2000s. By 1999, the cassette club had become the R. Stevie Moore CD-R Club (CDRSMCLUB), and in 2005, he reported that there was about 100 dedicated fans who bought his music on a monthly basis; \\"They love getting product directly from the artist. Around 70 percent are in the States and about 30 percent in [Europe] ... Sometimes they'll disappear, and then come back five years later.\\" In 2002, he recorded an album with Half Japanese frontman Jad Fair, titled FairMoore, described as \\"a lovely, heartfelt effort that shows both in top form\\" by critic Dave Mandl, who wrote that it \\"brings together two fiercely original figures in the American music underground\\", the album consisting of Fair reciting his poetry over Moore's instrumental backing. The 2009 compilation Me Too, issued on Cherry Red Records, was annotated by Dave Gregory of XTC. 2010s: Touring, Make It Be, and retirement Moore performing in London, 2011 Moore relocated back to his native Nashville in December 2010. In 2011, he established a new band with guitarist J.R. Thomason and embarked on his first ever tours, including Europe. He said: \\"Things are just exploding left and right and I can‚Äôt keep up with it all. I need management. It‚Äôs a great problem to have, but I can‚Äôt take advantage of it. I‚Äôm just one person. It‚Äôs crazy.\\" The world tour was made possible by a crowd-funded Kickstarter campaign and lasted for the next two years. In November 2012, Moore traveled to Los Angeles and recorded material with Jason Falkner, formerly of Jellyfish. Their collaboration produced the 2015 album Make It Be. In 2017, the album was given an official release through Bar/None Records and was met with generally favorable reviews. That April, Moore and Falker appeared together for a one-off performance at the South by Southwest music festival. Moore reflected that he had to stop his worldwide touring due to \\"health issues that are worsening,\\" adding that his career \\"started takin' off ... way too late in life\\" and that he had recently \\"given up making proper rock and pop, rock and roll music. I just kinda maintain my back catalog, I don‚Äôt record much anymore.\\" In 2019, Bar/None released Afterlife, a compilation of Moore tracks that were recorded at professional studios between 2006 and 2013. The album also features contributions from Ariel Pink, Jason Falkner, and Lane Steinberg. Most of the selections are remakes of decades-plus old songs. Moore said that the \\"final album playlist was purposefully kept safe, clean and more hi-fi mainstreamy, without my usual quirky left turns and lo-fi inserts.\\" On December 31, he issued a statement on his website purporting that he would offer \\"absolutely no further song writing, recording, performing, travelling, [or] interviews.\\" Impact and recognition AllMusic's Stewart Mason summarized Moore's body of work as a \\"one of a kind\\" mixture of \\"classic pop influences, arty experimentalism, idiosyncratic lyrics, wild stylistic left turns, and homemade rough edges.\\" However, \\"entire generations of lo-fi enthusiasts and indie trailblazers, from Guided by Voices to the Apples in Stereo, owe much to [his] pioneering in the field.\\" In the liner notes of Me Too, XTC member Dave Gregory stated that Moore was \\"a seriously underrated maverick talent, the Neil Young of the real underground ... his lyrics are intelligent and/or downright funny, he knows how to string a sequence of chords together and he has a gift for melody that many a more 'successful' songwriter would envy.\\" He worked with Moore on a remake of Moore's \\"Dates\\" in 1999. XTC founder Andy Partridge echoed of Moore's work: \\"What beauty, what invention.\\" Ariel Pink performing in 2009 A wider recognition of Moore's music came in the late 2000s as a result of newer acts who cited him as an influence. In particular, there was Ariel Pink, who initiated a correspondence with Moore earlier in the decade and recorded some collaborations. Pink's own work shared much of the same musical approaches, although Moore denies that they sound similar. Moore's exposure grew alongside Pink's solo success as he was repeatedly championed by Pink in various press interviews. In 2005, Pink contributed a song to Moore's Conscientious Objector compilation. He told a journalist around this era that he was \\"trying to like, reverse time. I'm trying to get Todd Hyman to reissue him on Acute. Then it can get like, the David-Fricke- fuckin'-Rolling Stone treatment. It's about time. It's criminal that he's not well known. Especially in light of the fact that I'm getting attention. ... Mojo has never even printed a word about him. Uncut, never a word.\\" In 2006, Pink curated the Moore retrospective Ariel Pink's Picks Vol. 1, and in 2012, the duo released the collaborative album Ku Klux Glam. When a 2006 New York Times article referenced Moore as the progenitor of \\"bedroom pop\\", he responded that the notion was \\"hilarious to me. I guess because of my age, because of my bitter struggle to make a living and get some notoriety, I scoff at it. ... A lot of the music coming out of these bedrooms is not even interesting, not worthy of being heard. But some of it will be.\\" Moore also hesitated to be associated with the \\"outsider music\\" tag, explaining that while he \\"loves\\" artists like Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston, \\"they have no concept as to how to write or arrange a Brian Wilson song.\\" In 2012, The Wires Matthew Ingram argued that \\"[h]is echoes can be heard in the music of artists like Pavement, Smog, Guided By Voices and Beck, and through his disciple Ariel Pink, he has unwittingly provided the template for the entire movement currently known as Hypnagogic Pop.\\" Tim Burrows of Dazed Digital similarly noted that \\"with a little help from James Ferraro and a few others, Moore and Pink can be credited with influencing [the] whole [genre of] hypnagogic pop.\\"  Discography  Due to his prolific output, the majority of Moore's CD and vinyl releases have been career-spanning compilations. He noted having \\"sort of ... two discographies: my own that contains all of my self-released material and the official releases, which are what record labels decided to put out over the years.\\" During a 1984 appearance on The Scott and Gary Show, he stated that he had 109 releases in total. In 2012, his Bandcamp page listed over 200 releases. Although it is often reported that his complete discography exceeds 400 albums, Moore said that the estimate was not an \\"actual proven number\\" and that \\"400 might seem stretching it a bit, [but] when it comes down to every bit of home taping I‚Äôve ever done, including producing friends, alternate dub versions, session discs, audio verite ephemera, etcetera, it suddenly becomes an unlimited guess.\\" In response to this Wikipedia article, which formerly stated that the count was \\"at least 200\\", Moore requested fans on his website to tally a more accurate estimate. In February 2018, he received a count of 354 releases listed on his \\"tapelist\\" page (including video and live recordings), 391 on his \\"albums list\\" page, and 344 on Bandcamp.

Ontario Hydro's Plan to Serve Customers' Electricity Needs\\" was a four-volume 1989 study to the year 2014 by Ontario Hydro, the then supplier of electric power for the province of Ontario, Canada. The general public of Ontario was provided with copies of this report free of charge, and ask for feedback. Overview The report explained why Ontario needed an electricity plan. It analyzed the people using electricity, a flexible system for serving customers, priority resources to meet needs, choosing the best major supply options, finding a balanced solution, and it added a glossary about electricity. The report was part of what was known as the \\"25-year plan\\". The report was intended to stimulate discussion of the various goals and methods to meet the objectives of Ontario Hydro. One purpose of the overall 25-year plan was to ensure there would be enough electricity to meet the growing demand at a price which would maintain various industries within their operating territory. Many opponents did not have sufficient resources to present their opposition in a business fashion and Ontario Hydro was mandated to provide financial resources to some opposing groups. One significant finding by an opposition group was that the report omitted defining the overall health effects of the presented options. Demand/Supply Plan Report This report, in colour, with tables and graphs, went into details on the amount of electricity that was expected to be demanded from the electricity supply system every year until 2014, and showed how much additional generating capacity would have to be provided to meet that demand. For example, on page 3-15 is a table showing that, as an estimate, there is only a 10% probability that less than 28.6 gigawatts (GW) will be needed as peak in 2005, 29.0 GW in 2006, 29.6 GW in 2007, and 33.5 GW in 2014. The report went into great detail about what the needs were anticipated to be, defined resources, and examined various alternative plans (How much nuclear? Fossil fuel? Minimum pollution? Least expensive? Matters of politics? etc.) to ensure sufficient electricity would be available when it was needed in Ontario, considering not only the additional demand, but also the expected retirements before 2015 of older generating facilities. Appendix A was about strategy (March 1989), Appendix B provides a list of references, and Appendix C is a glossary, including commonly used acronyms. Outcome As a result of the recession of the early 1990s, power demand stopped rising at the historical rate for several years. As a result, the plan was perceived to be overly ambitious and the environmental assessment required to review it was eventually abandoned. Ontario Hydro essentially stopped any further future planning and concentrated on running its existing assets. As a result, in the early years of the 21st century, Ontario was suffering from inadequate domestic power supplies and had to import power from other utilities. =Actual peak demand and pricing = The record, so up to July 15, 2005, was 26,170 megawatts (MW) . Ontario had to purchase 3400 megawatts at up to seven times the normal rate, according to Metro of July 19 quoting the Torstar News Service, to meet the peak demand. Unfunded electricity debt so far is $20.6 billion, with Ontario's household consumers being charged only 5 cents per kilowatt hour for the first 750 kilowatt hours, and only 5.8 cents for the remainder. The price of imported power had sometimes risen to nearly 39 cents a kilowatt hour, while it normally is in the 5 to 10 cent range. Peak demand for 2006 was 27,005 megawatts. This is the peak demand as of December 2009. Peak demand for 2007 was 25,737 megawatts. Peak demand for 2008 was 24,195 megawatts.

Rashida Tlaib criticized Tapper for \\"comparing Palestinian human rights advocates to terrorist white nationalists,\\" calling it \\"fundamentally a lie.\\" In response, Tapper said that \\"those who believe Palestinian leaders bear responsibility for the incitement of terrorism cannot then let US leaders off the hook and act as if words don't matter\\". =Other programs and media= Tapper has contributed to GQ, The Weekly Standard, NPR's All Things Considered, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. In 2001, he hosted the program Take Five on CNN, in which young journalists and commentators discussed politics and pop culture.

A sad, real tale about this war, America and the brave warriors who live‚Äîand die‚Äîat the point of the spear\\" and Jon Krakauer called it \\"a mind-boggling, all-too-true story of heroism, hubris, failed strategy, and heartbreaking sacrifice. If you want to understand how the war in Afghanistan went off the rails, you need to read this book.\\" In 2014, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society recognized Tapper for the book and his reporting on military topics in general with the Tex McCrary Award for Excellence in Journalism.

He was an opponent of the Muslims led by Muhammad and is best known as the master of Bilal ibn Rabah, a slave he tortured for converting to Islam. Other transliterations of his name include Umayya, Umaya, Umaiiya and Umaiya. Biography =Family= He was the son of Khalaf ibn Safwan ibn Habib ibn Wahb ibn Hudhafah ibn Jumah and brother of Ubaydullah ibn Khalaf. He married three times. By his wife, Safiya bint Ma'mar ibn Habib, he had some sons; Safwan, Ahyah, and Salamah. By his wife, Karima bint Ma'mar ibn Habib, he had some sons; Walid and Ali (who were both slain at Badr), Rabi'ah, Muslim, Ma'bad and Mas'ud. By his wife Layla bint Habib al-Tamimiyya from B.Tamim, he had a daughter, named al-Taw'ama bint Umayya. =Opposition to Islam= Umayyah was involved in the pagan religious ceremonies of Mecca, where he distributed perfume in the square of the Kaaba. After Muhammad began to preach against idolatry, Umayyah became a staunch opponent of the new teaching. He used to slander Muhammad, and it is about him that Allah revealed Surah Humaza: \\"Woe to the slanderer and backbiter\\". He subjected his slave Bilal ibn Ribah to torture for having adopted Islam. He forced Bilal to lie on hot desert sand and pinned him down with a heavy stone on his chest. When Bilal still refused to denounce Islam, a heavy person was to jump on the stone. Bilal kept repeating, \\"Ahad! Ahad!\\" (One God! One God!)Slavery From Islamic and Christian Perspectives by Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi on Al-islam.org , referencing Ibn Sa'd, op. cit., vol. III:1, p. 166; Abu Na'im, op. cit., vol. 1, p. 148; Ibn Hajar, op. cit., vol. 1, p. 336. =Friendship with Abd al-Rahman= Ummayah had a close friend named Abdul Rahman ibn Awf, but their friendship was strained when Abdu Amr converted to Islam.John Glubb, The Life and times Muhammad, Lanham 1998, p. 186f. Abdu Amr changed his name to Abd al-Rahman and later emigrated to Medina. Because of their friendship, the two formed a written agreement, according to which Abdul Rahman was to protect Umayah's property and/or family in Medina, while Umayyah would protect Abd-al-Rahman's in Mecca. When Abd al-Rahman's name was mentioned in the document, Umayyah protested, saying \\"I do not know Ar-Rahman\\" and requested that the pre-Islamic name \\"Abdu Amr\\" should be used, to which Abd al-Rahman yielded. =Pilgrimage of Sa'd= Umayyah was also an good friend of Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, the leader of the Banu Aus . When Umayyah was in Medina on his way to Syria, he used to stay with Sa'd and when Sa'd was in Mecca, he used to stay with Umayah. Prior to the Battle of Badr, Sa'd visited Mecca once to perform his Umrah with Umayyah, when they came across Abu Jahl. They had an argument, and as it became heated, Sa'd threatened Abu Jahl with stopping the Meccan trade route to Syria and informed Umayyah that his life was threatened by Muhammad. =Battle of Badr= In March 624 the Meccans decided to confront the Muslim forces that threatened a caravan from Syria led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. Abu Jahl rallied the people for war, saying, \\"Go and protect your caravan.\\" Umayyah, who was anxious about Sa'd's warning, did not want to leave Mecca; but Abu Jahl said to him: \\"O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind, though you are the chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.\\" Abu Jahl urged until Umayyah said, \\"As you have forced me to change my mind, I will buy the best camel in Mecca.\\" Umayyah told his wife: \\"O Umm Safwan, prepare what I need [for the journey].\\" She said to him, \\"O Abu Safwan! Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?\\" He said, \\"No, but I do not want to go with them but for a short distance.\\" When Umayyah went out, he tied his camel wherever he camped. =Death= Battle was joined on 13 March 624. During the battle, Umayyah was captured by his old friend Abdul Rahman ibn Awf. He was killed by a group of Muslims led by his former slave Bilal (who was a victim of his earlier torture), in spite of Abdul Rahman's protests and his attempt to shield Umayyah with his own body. His son Ali was also killed at Badr while defending his father.

It is on the southern edge of Lisburn; about one mile from Lisburn city centre, and ten miles (16 km) from central Belfast. Sprucefield is located beside the M1 motorway and the A1 road. It is split in two parts: the Sprucefield Centre and Sprucefield Park. Sprucefield is also the site of the Lisnagarvey transmitting station. Sprucefield Centre Sprucefield Centre was developed by Marks and Spencer on the site of Lisnagarvey Hockey Club and opened in March 1989. The proximity to the radio transmitter required the centre to be built as a Faraday cage to protect electronic equipment from the mast's electromagnetic field. Sprucefield Centre includes shops such as Marks and Spencer, Next, Pets At Home and Boots. The centre was virtually destroyed in January 1991 in an IRA incendiary attack. Three of four stores were destroyed, (MFI, Allied Maples and Texas), while the Marks and Spencer wing suffered only water damage. An expansion of Marks and Spencer has been reported for many years. An outline planning application was submitted in 1995, followed by a public inquiry in 1999. The Planning Service recommended the proposal be accepted. If built the extension calls for the demolition and resiting of the transmitter station, although these plans never went ahead. In August 2007, Marks and Spencer opened a large homeware section (second largest in the UK after Manchester) on the Sprucefield site in what had been the adjoining Homebase shop. Homebase's lease on the building was not renewed by M&S; who own the entire complex. M&S; also upgraded its anchor store with a new caf√©, better lighting and customer friendly walkways. The expansion of their Sprucefield store makes it the largest store in Ireland and the third largest in the United Kingdom. In April 2016 Marks and Spencer reported that their Lisburn Sprucefield store recorded the highest food sales of any of their UK stores making it the most profitable store in the M&S; network. Sprucefield Park Sprucefield Park was opened in 2003, with Sainsbury's and B&Q; as anchor tenants. There are four smaller units, occupied by Currys, Argos, and Next Home. The 21,500m2 (231,426 ft2) project was managed by a Stannifer/Snoddons Construction joint venture. Stannifer is a British property development company, while the latter is a construction company based in Hillsborough, County Down. Construction was carried out by McLaughlin & Harvey.Retail ‚Äì Sprucefield Park. Accessed on 28 June 2007. Stannifer took ownership of the site, while it retained a 50% share of the proposed second phase. In 2004 The Westfield Group acquired Stannifer's parent (Chelsfield) and took control of the company's shares in Sprucefield Park. Sprucefield Park (like the Sprucefield Centre) has faced major objections at almost every stage. Sainsbury's announced its move into Northern Ireland on 20 June 1995O'Kane, Paul, Sainsbury's to invest ¬£100m in 7 new outlets in North. Irish Times 21 June 1995 and opened its first stores in 1997, however it would be eight years before its Sprucefield store was opened. An application for outline planning permission was submitted in July 1998 and final permission was granted in February 2001. The planning permission for the centre also included a multiplex cinema and a 150-bed hotel, however these have yet to be built. Lisnagarvey Hockey Club, which sold its pitches to Marks and Spencer for its development in 1989, had again to relocate when it sold its pitches to the developers of Sprucefield Park. In December 2004 the B&Q; store was extensively damaged by an incendiary device. The store was closed for approximately six months. In January 2005 another firebomb was discovered in the centre's Sainsbury's store, however this was successfully defused. Both incidents, and others such as the destruction of a Next store at Forestside Shopping Centre in Belfast, were blamed on dissident republicans. In September 2015 B&Q; announced that its Sprucefield branch was one of five Northern Ireland stores that it will close. =Second phase= In June 2004 the developers announced plans for a John Lewis department store and 29 additional units on the site. Despite objections from Lisburn retailers and the Belfast Chamber of Commerce the development was given approval in June 2005 by then Northern Ireland Environment Minister Jeff Rooker. However, in October 2005 six parties opposed to the development won the right to seek a judicial review of the planning permission. These parties were Belfast City Council, Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, Lisburn Chamber of Commerce, the owners of Lisburn's Bow Street Mall, Central Craigavon Limited and AM Developments Limited (AM Developments is building the Victoria Square centre in Belfast city centre). On 10 May 2006 the appeal was upheld, effectively removing planning permission. However the judge, Mr Justice Girvan, said he was not ruling on the merits of the store itself, rather on the way the decision to grant permission was taken. This allowed a new planning application to be submitted. Westfield and Snoddens' reaffirmed their commitment to pursuing planning permission in November 2006 after a new legal challenge by Central Craigavon Ltd., owners of the Rushmere Shopping Centre. Westfield detailed its new planning application on 26 August 2008. The number of additional retail units planned was reduced from 29 to 19, however the developers conceded that the proposal is \\"ostensibly the same\\" at a total floor space of approximately 50,000 square metres (540,000 sq ft).Manley, John. \\"Sprucefield plans 'little changed'\\" Irish News. p.54. 29 August 2008 In March 2014 Westfield agreed to sell Sprucefield Park to Intu Properties plc for ¬£70 million.

(GQT Movies, formerly GQTI) is a chain of 22 movie theaters, headquartered in Grand Rapids, MI, representing a total of 174 screens in the United States. The majority of GQT Movies' locations are in Michigan, but other locations could be found in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. The company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2020. All employees were terminated March 19, 2020 without notice largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as many movie theaters were closed by government order in many states. In last July 2020, the company began reopening some of their locations. By the end of the year it had reopened its 22 locations. The first IMAX screens operated by Goodrich Quality Theaters were unveiled in early 2007. After undergoing renovations, Randall 15 IMAX in Batavia, Illinois featured an IMAX screen, as does Portage 16 IMAX in Portage, Indiana. Opening in March 2008, Hamilton 16 IMAX + GDX in Noblesville, Indiana was the third GQT location with an IMAX while adding two Giant Digital Experience (GDX) auditoriums in 2016 featuring Dolby Atmos sound. Savoy 16 near Champaign, Illinois underwent renovations and opened an IMAX auditorium on May 3, 2013, to make the fourth IMAX location for Goodrich Quality Theaters. All of GQT's screens were converted to digital in the Fall of 2011. Every GQT location featured one or more screens equipped with 3D technology, either in RealD 3D or MasterImage 3D. At the same time, GQT had stepped into the restaurant industry with Features Gastropub in Gibsonton, Florida, a suburb of Tampa. Bob Goodrich, was the owner and president of Goodrich Quality Theaters, also owns and operates WPRR AM and FM in Grand Rapids. On February 28, 2020, Goodrich Quality Theaters filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July 2020, Mason Asset Management, Namdar Realty, and VIP Cinemas purchased Goodrich Quality Theaters under the name Goodrich Theater Newco. It was formed in Delaware on July 1, 2020. On July 7, 2020, documents were filed with the Missouri Secretary of State to operate the two Missouri Goodrich theaters as Goodrich Theater Propco LLC - Forum 8 and Goodrich Theater Propco LLC - Capital 8, creating an LLC for each theater location. Creating a LLC for each location is becoming a common scenario to prevent loss in that if one theater location goes bankrupt then it will not cause the entire chain to go bankrupt. The purpose of creating the LLCs were to Operate a movie theater and the Secretary of State documents were electronically signed by Igal Namdar.  History  The origins of Goodrich Quality Theaters can be traced back to 1930, when William Goodrich left his family's rubber manufacturing business in order to purchase the Savoy Theatre in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan. Previously, the Savoy Theatre had been a vaudeville theater; Goodrich renovated it as a single-screen movie theater and opened it in 1931 with \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\". Business at the theater prospered, largely due to Goodrich's cheap double features. For just 15 cents, patrons could watch the main feature, followed by a B-Movie. By comparison, the average price for a movie ticket nationwide hovered between 23 and 25 cents during the 1930s. The Savoy was later converted into a two-screen theater and finally shut down in 1979. William Goodrich also operated the Majestic Theatre in Grand Rapids, which was later sold and currently exists as the Meijer Majestic Theatre, owned by the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre. Control of the company was handed down to William's son, Bob Goodrich, who still heads Goodrich Quality Theaters. Bob Goodrich extensively expanded the company, founding new multiplexes and drive-ins around Michigan. Some of the \\"original\\" multiplex theaters are still in operation today. Many have since been expanded, and all have undergone technological renovations (such as the addition of digital sound, digital projection, and recliner seating). Bob Goodrich eventually began building his business outside Michigan, establishing theaters in nearby states. Over the last decade, the chain has focused on renovating older theaters with modern amenities, as well as continuing to build and plan brand new multiplexes beyond the Midwest. In February 2020, Goodrich Quality Theaters declared bankruptcy and in July 2020 it was sold off to a few different companies with Mason Asset Management and Mark McSparin getting the bulk number of theaters (22).  Theaters  GQT theaters are primarily located in small towns and mid-sized cities. All locations are multiplex theaters, ranging from 4-to-16 screens and offer multiple formats and experiences across the board. The standard GQT location featured classic designs of the late 1990s, largely due to acquiring locally owned theaters from private exhibitors. Newer theaters or remodeled theaters break with this tradition by incorporating vibrant colors with a modern design. An increasing variety of food options were being sold at GQT concession stands, offering more concessions over traditional movie theater snacks. Typical concession items included popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, pretzels, hot dogs, and slushies. Some larger multiplexes began offering personal pan pizzas, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks. Screen taps is a belly-up bar or bar behind a concession stand giving adult moviegoers aged 21 or over an alternative to the traditional beverages offered at the theater concession stand. Offering select local and regional craft beers on draft, plus a variety of domestic bottle choices. In addition, Screen Taps have a house red or white wine. Select locations also serve margaritas and daiquiris. Screen Taps is available at Bay City 10 GDX (Bay City), Brownsburg 8 GDX (Brownsburg), Eastside 10 IMAX (Lafayette), Jackson 10 (Jackson), Kalamazoo 10 (Kalamazoo), Krafft 8 (Port Huron), and West Columbia 7 (Battle Creek). Patrons are required to present their ticket stub, show a valid I.D., and drink responsibly. No alcoholic beverages are served during G or PG features before 8:00 P.M. at all Screen Taps locations. GQT offers incentives for repeat visits, such as GQT Rewards that allows a customer to redeem free concession items after earning a certain number of points from ticket and concession purchases. This program also offers free birthday and anniversary popcorns.  Premium formats  GQT offers a few premium formats at their locations, while all locations are equipped to show 3D films in RealD 3D in select auditoriums. =IMAX= IMAX screens and projectors are being installed at larger theatre complexes. The only GQT IMAX theaters is located Eastside 10 IMAX. =Giant Digital Experience (GDX)= GDX is Goodrich Quality Theaters‚Äô premium large format theater experience with crystal clear imaging and an amazing bright picture, delivering movies on a massive scale with massive sound.

Two theaters feature GDX auditoriums, Brownsburg 8 GDX and the Bay City 10 GDX.  Employees  Goodrich cast members are all part-time and primarily consist of high school and college students. Cast members perform duties such as operating cash registers and cleaning theaters between shows. Theater managers typically start out as staffers rather than directly hired in as managers. Regional Managers are responsible for all theaters in their designated area. GQT Movies has two regional offices. Regional Managers report to the GQT headquarters in Grand Rapids. =Dismissal of underaged employees= As of 2019 there haven been reports that the theater chain is laying off all employees under the age of 18. According to staff members, the main reason behind the layoffs is because there is a negative connotation linked to teenagers and not solely due to their performance. As of January 1, 2020, all 16 year olds employed by the company were let go, and there were still plans to lay off all 17 year olds effective July 2020; these plans were announced before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States. Since the new ownership took over in July 2020, they have rehired 16 and 17 year olds and no longer have this policy.  Noovie  A pre-show plays on all screens before performances, dubbed the Noovie, is produced by National CineMedia (NCM). The Noovie features advertisements for local establishments, nationwide ad campaigns (including movie trailers), and content created for or by GQT. The show generally runs between 15 and 25 minutes and is timed to end exactly when the movie is scheduled to begin. NCM also handles the advertising content played on flat-screen TVs located in the lobbies of GQT locations.  R-Rated Film Policy  GQT adheres to national and local laws, following the guidelines of the MPAA's film ratings system. Slight differences exist per market, but nationwide, no person under age 16 is admitted into an R-rated film without a parent or guardian aged 21 or older purchasing their ticket. Those who do meet or exceed the age of 16 and look under the age of 25 must present a photo ID with name and date of birth to be admitted to such movies.

Ramchand was part of the Bombay team in five more Ranji wins, scoring a hundred in all five finals. He scored 149 in the 1951‚Äì52 final against Holkar, 106 in the 1959‚Äì60 final against Mysore, 118 in the 1960‚Äì61 final against Rajasthan, 100 in the 1961‚Äì62 final against Rajasthan, and 102 not out in the 1962‚Äì63 final against Rajasthan. =International= Ramchand was picked in the Indian squad for the England tour in 1952 with his selection being called a \\"surprise\\". He was dismissed for a pair of ducks in his debut Test at Headingley. He played all four Tests on the tour, and managed only 68 runs and 4 wickets in the series. His performance improved on the West Indies tour in 1952‚Äì53, when he was not only promoted up the order but also given the new ball. He made 249 runs at an average of 24.90 in the five-match series and took 8 wickets. When India toured Pakistan for five Tests in early 1955, Ramchand averaged 24.90 with the bat and took 10 wickets. His notable performances in the series included a knock of 53 in the second Test after India were reduced to 103 for 7, and career-best bowling figures of 6 for 49 in the fifth Test match at Karachi. Ramchand scored his maiden Test hundred (unbeaten 106) against New Zealand at Calcutta in December 1955. His second Test hundred came at his home ground Brabourne Stadium against Australia in October 1956, when he made 109 against a bowling attack consisting of Ray Lindwall, Pat Crawford, Alan Davidson and Richie Benaud. His knock which included 19 fours was described as \\"an innings of guts and gumption, studded with rasping square-cuts and full-blooded hooks.\\" Ramchand's next series came two years later when the West Indies toured India for three Tests. In an otherwise unsuccessful series, his unbeaten 67 in the first match ensured India held on for a draw. In December 1959, Ramchand was named captain for the five-match series against Australia. Although his individual performance in the series was unimpressive with averages of 12.33 with the bat and 200 with the ball, Ramchand's captaincy was praised in the media as he led India to its first Test win against Australia, in the second match at Kanpur. India lost the series 1‚Äì2 amid expectations of a whitewash victory for the strong Australian team. Chandu Borde recollected that Ramchand captained the team \\"brilliantly to victory\\" and that he was \\"always giving us the self-belief that we could beat them.\\" This was also his last series for India. Playing style Ramchand was an aggressive middle-order batsman who also often opened the bowling. Wisden Asia, in its obituary, described him as \\"a brilliant all- rounder: an explosive batsman, a very good opening bowler and a superb close catcher.\\" Although strongly built, Ramchand was a medium-pace swing bowler and mainly relied on the inswinger. Cricket writer Sujit Mukherjee once said that Ramchand \\"looked every inch a fast bowler until he actually bowled.\\" As a captain, Ramchand was remembered by his teammates as a leader who instilled self-belief in them and motivated them. Later life and death Ramchand worked as the manager of the Indian team at the 1975 Cricket World Cup. He worked 26 years for Air India, having served as station manager in Bangkok and Hong Kong. In 1995, he recovered after suffering a cardiac arrest. Ramchand suffered three heart attacks in the two months preceding his death. He was admitted to the Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai on 1 September 2003, and, days before his death, asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for financial help for his treatment. The BCCI granted 2 lakh for the treatment, saying further financial assistance would be provided if required. On 5 September, it was reported that he had been discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). His wife Leela Ramchand stated that \\"he had to be shifted out of the ICU as we cannot afford it.\\" He died on 8 September in the hospital due to \\"heart complications\\".

His autobiographical 1979 memoir, Pubertet (Puberty), won the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1979. Biography Harry Martinson and Ivar Lo-Johansson (right) Ivar Lo-Johansson on a farm. Born Ivar Johansson in √ñsmo in a family of bound (unfree) agricultural labourers. He began using the name Ivar Lo-Johansson in his twenties, claiming \\"Lo\\" was a family name. Unsuccessfully trying to register the name, he was eventually registered by Swedish authorities as Karl Ivar Loe.Hans O Alfredsson Ivar Lo- Johansson hette egentligen Loe Svenska Dagbladet 23 February 2010 (in Swedish) In the 1920s Ivar Lo-Johansson travelled in Europe. His early books were travel books depicting the working-class in France and England. Ivar Lo- Johansson wrote over 50 proletarian novels and short-stories, all of which carried vivid portrayals of working-class people. He described the situation of the Swedish land-workers, statare, in his novels, short stories and journalism, which encouraged the adoption of certain land reforms in Sweden. He also caused much controversy with his features on old-age pensioners, gypsies and other non-privileged people. He died, aged 89, in Stockholm. Lo- Johansson first came to the literary fore in the mid-1930s with the publication of his novel Godnatt, jord (Good night, earth, 1933) and two short story collections. His stories were infused with realistic and detailed depictions of the plight of landless Swedish peasants, known as statare. The first of his collection of short stories to be published was Statarna I‚ÄìII (1936‚Äì37; The Sharecroppers), followed by his Jordprolet√§rerna (1941; Proletarians of the Earth, a novel. Autobiographical to a large extent, these works were nevertheless more than one man's story. They were a potent attack on the prevalent social conditions, especially the inequality in Swedish society. Lo-Johansson's books combined political astuteness and literary craftsmanship to such a competent degree that they are regarded as the stimulant behind the labor movement that ultimately led to the abolition of indentured farm labor in 1945. Lo-Johansson is best known for his vivid recollections of the life in Swedish trade-unionist and literary circles of the twenties, thirties and forties. He also continued throughout his long life to insist that literature should face the world from the under-dog's perspective. Lo-Johansson's works are characterized by a vivid expression of individual human suffering. A great example of this motif is character of the farm servant's wife in Only A Mother (1939). He also explored the conflict between individualism and collectivism extensively in his autobiographical series of eight novels. He published the series in the 1950s with The Illiterate (1951). He published the last book in the series, The Proletarian Writer in 1960. In the 1970s he wrote numerous short stories dealing with the seven deadly sins. In the 1980s he wrote several memoirs. Legacy Ivar Los park on Mariaberget, Stockholm is named after him. There is a 1991 bronze bust of Lo-Johansson by Nils M√∂llerberg in the park on Bastugatan. The Ivar Lo Society preserves his apartment in Stockholm as a museum. The Stockholm city library describes Lo-Johansson as \\"one of our greatest proletarian writers\\" and an \\"innovator of Swedish realistic prose, engaged with social issues like care of the elderly and the question of tied labour.\\" Bibliography *Vagabondliv i Frankrike (1927) *Kolet i v√•ld.

Burauen is politically subdivided into 77 barangays. Climate History The legend The name ‚ÄúBurauen‚Äù evolved from the word ‚Äúharu‚Äù which means ‚Äúspring‚Äù. This is because Burauen is the fountainhead of several rivers: the big Daguitan and Marabong rivers, the Guinarona and Hibuga rivers that pass through several neighboring towns, as well as several smaller ones. The legend behind the name speaks of a drought when several tributaries of these rivers dried up, forcing people to flock to a cluster of large springs in the town. The place was duly called ‚ÄúBuraburon‚Äù which according to Justice Norberto Lopez Romualdez Sr., is the ‚Äúmultiplicative construction of the word ‚Äúharu‚Äù (spring), which indicates ‚Äúabundance‚Äù. Over the years, the name ‚ÄúBuraburon‚Äù (‚Äúhaving many springs‚Äù) evolved into ‚ÄúBurawon‚Äù and finally into ‚ÄúBurawen‚Äù. The Early Settlers Clandestine diggings conducted by antique hunters and verified by the National Museum archaeologists yield valuable artifacts consisting of chinaware and jars. Some of the discoveries were Stone Age artifacts and implements. These antiques and artifacts were found on the plateaus of both sides of the Kag- oloolo Brook of Barangay Patag and Villa Aurora, which were about 16 kilometers southwest of the poblacion of Burauen. Similar artifacts were found in Barangay Paghudlan which is 12 kilometers from the Kag-oloolo. The earlier diggings on the south western portion of the poblacion, and those in Barangay Tambuco and Armasen unearth several precious antiques. With the extensive presence of these artifacts over the said areas, the past locations of the early settlements in Burauen during the prehistoric epoch are indicated. The Spanish Time The Jesuit Friars discovered Burauen as settlement in the later part of 1595 when they used the community as a base in the Christianization of the central part of Leyte. Between years 1609 to 1616 Burauen was the most populous town of Leyte and Samar and it consistently registered the highest tax collection during the same period in the region. From Buraburon, the settlers were told by the Jesuit Missionaries to transfer to ‚ÄúArmasen‚Äù (meaning a trading place that is at the same time a granary), presently a sitio of Barangay Libas, which was similarly named today. Due to frequent flooding of the area by the Guinarona River, and to facilitate their ‚Äúreduction de visitas‚Äù, they transferred to the site of the present Barangay Malabca and led by Tamdon and his brother Hangdon who were the children of the last Rajah. The Filipino - American War A captured photo of the Pulahan movement Leader, Faustino Ablen (Center) sitting between a standing member of Philippine Constabulary and an African-American soldier The short-lived Philippine Republic proclaimed on June 12, 1898 face a new enemy, the American who were pursuing their so-called ‚ÄúManifest Destiny‚Äù The troops of the Revolutionary Army under General Ambrosio Mojica, realizing that their fortification of ‚Äúestacas‚Äù (bamboo palisades) around the poblacion of Burauen were weak, they force to withdraw to the mountains. Several encounters occur during the Filipino-American War, the American burned the poblacion on July 4, 1900, sparing only the Catholic Church, its convent, the warehouses and the building of the Smith Bell and Co. and Chinese merchandizing. This incident made Burauen one of the strongholds of the ‚ÄúPulahan‚Äù dissidents. With the cessation of hostilities, the people devoted their efforts to the reconstruction of their homes and expansion of their farms to usher progress of the municipality. The productive endeavors of the people lured many enterprises to the town. The first Electric System and cinematographic house in Leyte and Samar were established in Burauen in 1916. In 1928 Burauen Academy, the first secondary school in the municipality was founded. The different municipal administrations of the time were able to put up irrigation system in 1912. Constructed a big public market in 1918, erect a concrete municipal building in 1925 and build concrete school building in 1928. the income of the municipality in 1918 to 1928 was bigger than the income of the whole province of Surigao, this due to the wide area of abaca plantation of that time. This boomtown prosperity of Burauen lasted until 1929 when the great depression took place. World War II Period A Japanese Canon left in the town after World War 2 The outbreak of World War II stunted the economic growth of Burauen. The Japanese Military encamped the eastern part of the poblacion there were many encounters between the Japanese forces and the guerillas who were firmly establish in their mountain strongholds. During the Allied Forces liberation of Leyte on October 20, 1944, Burauen was among the most heavily devastated towns in Leyte, thousands of civilians were killed and a number of properties were destroyed. Post War Period to Present Rising from the ruins of war, the municipality rehabilitated its homes and agriculture, hand in hand with the improvement of its institution and facilities. In 1946, the Burauen High School was founded, followed by the rehabilitation of the Gabaldon School Building, and the construction and operation of the water system in 1948. The private sector contributed in the field of education in 1950 the Burauen Institute and the Rizal Colleges were founded. The progress of the town suffered a setback in the middle part of 1951 when a very strong typhoon hit Burauen, which was followed by four others that were equally ravaging. In 1952, despite financial hardships, the municipal government was able to repair the municipal building from its own funds but generally, the recovery of the municipality was very slow. On March 2, 1962 the Rural Bank of Burauen was established, the first rural bank in Leyte and Samar. A decade after, on April 1, 1972 the Burauen District Hospital was opened to accept its first patient. During the intervening years and onward, road and bridges construction and street concreting in the poblacion and the Barangays alike were pursued, together with the construction of school building and health centers. The public market area as well as the irrigation system was expanded. Prior to incorporation as a separate town, Burauen was part of Dagami. The town was a mission church established by the Jesuits, along with Pastrana which was also part of Dagami. Meanwhile, the municipalities of La Paz and Julita was once part of Burauen. Lapaz has been separated in 1918. While in 1949, through an executive order from Malaca√±ang, Julita become a separate town three decades after Lapaz become independent.

With extensive promotion and backing of experts, Burauen is off to a good start in its goal to market and cement the town's status as the spring capital of Leyte. Other identified eco-tourism sites are in the villages of Matin-ao, Tambis, Villa Rosas, Abuyogon, Cansiboy, and Kagbana. These areas are seen as an addition to Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park, a site proclaimed as a national park in 1937. Notable persons supporting the initiative are former actress and UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocate Antoinette Taus, former Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, and Asean Center for Biodiversity Director Mundita Lim. =Attractions= Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park Burauen's upland territories are composed of wetland forests that contain thousands of century old trees, unique species of birds and mammals, plants and marine species mostly scattered inside Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park. It is also has with many natural sites such as lakes, mountain ranges, rivers, waterfalls, hot springs and a volcano. MVNP has an elevation of 1,200 meters above sea level and an area of 635 hectares, within the boundaries of Burauen, La Paz and McArthur towns. Mahagnao Volcano Mahagnao Volcano Crater Mahagnao Volcano is a dormant volcano located in Barangay Mahagnao, more than 30 km away from the town proper. Although the volcano has been inactive, it is still classified as potentially active due to the active thermal features of the mountain. Tourist are allowed to hike on its peak. Malagsum Lake This lake is smaller compared to the other one. It is a highly acidic lake which contains high level of sulfuric acid making it impossible for marine lives or some organisms to thrive. Except for the hundreds to thousands of wild docks making it as breeding ground or a home for migratory birds during migrating season. Mahagnao Lake This lake serves as the main source of marine products for the locals and also the center of its tourism activities. Several resorts owned privately or by community associations are on the lakeshore. Matigbao Lake It is the smallest of the three lakes inside the park. But it is also the farthest and the most challenging to have a trek. Due to being isolated, the environment is quite different from what commonly seen in the rest of the park. There are numerous species of plants and insects thriving within the vicinity (such as dragonflies). Calor Hot spring The spring is just located at the southern foot of the volcano. It was a system of springs heated by an active thermal feature. Thus, creating a hot spring that merges to another system of spring creating a river of hot spring. Guin-aniban Water Fall The waterfall is located few kilometers on the southeast. It is the water from the Mahagnao lake which is passing to systems of rivers then merge before approaching on the mouth of the cliff creating a water fall that directly flow on the larger river called Marabong. Religion Artist Perspective of the underconstruction Immaculate Conception Parish Like the Philippines as a whole, Burauen is also a predominantly Catholic town that traces its origin way back during the early period of Spanish Colonialism. It all started when the Jesuits arrived in the Philippines in 1590, they came to Leyte and established a temporary residence in Dulag in 1595, and another residencia in Dagami in 1613 which became one of the two Jesuit residences in Leyte, the other being Carigara. The Dulag rector Fr. Pascual de Acu√±a started apostolic work in Burauen in 1622 (Redondo, 1886). It seemed to have been an embryonic missionary outpost for so many years because Fr. Francisco Colins wrote in 1663 that Dagami had only ten villages with their own churches. Burauen was not one of them. A 1767 Royal Decree ceded Burauen from the Jesuits to the Augustinian Recollects when the former was expelled in the Philippines in 1768. The Jesuits‚Äô possessions were forfeited except for the obras pias. ‚ÄúThe Diocese of Cebu (which had jurisdiction over Leyte-Samar) refused to recognize the Jesuits' mission-pueblos as parishes even if the pueblos had functioned as parishes, some for at least a century,‚Äù says Leyte-Samar historian Rolando Borrinaga. \\"I assume this would have been the time that Burauen‚Äôs pueblo- mission status was demoted to a visita of Dulag, because at that time, Burauen was already a pueblo with its own parish priest\\" (Borrinaga, 2020). The oldest entries in Burauen's records date back to June 3, 1804, during the time of Augustinian Fr. Pedro Gomez as parish priest (Redondo, 1886). In his Estado Geografico published in 1865, the Franciscan friar Fr. Felix Huerta wrote that Burauen formally separated from its mother parish in Dulag in 1844 with Fr. Francisco Lopez as its parish priest. Given the rivalry between the Jesuits and the Franciscans (and the alliance of Augustinians and Franciscans), Fr. Huerta, like the Diocese of Cebu, did not seem to acknowledge Burauen as a Jesuits‚Äô pueblo-mission. From the river, Fr. Lopez oversaw the transfer and construction of a new Augustinian-led church to a new site (presumably at the present-day location) made of hardwood posts with double paneling of planks and nipa roofing 186 ft. long and 48 ft. wide. With Burauen right smack on a typhoon path, the structure would not survive long. Construction Progress as of May 2020 Currently, the under construction new Burauen, Leyte Immaculate Conception Catholic church is slowly taking shape. Once finished, the church would be of a neo-gothic design, which features geometric decorative designs and decorative blocks.

Yeater issued Executive Order No. 4, creating the town of Calubian which is formerly a barrio of the Municipality of Leyte, Leyte. Originally, its name was Eulalia in honor of a prominent lady resident. Later it was changed to Calubian due to the vast coconut plantation of the place (Photo shown is the Eulalia Monument located at the foot of the Veloso hill on the way to the Municipal Hall). The Local Government of Calubian was formerly organized on January 22, 1919 with Felix Garganera as its first town executive. In 1922, he was succeeded by Nepumoceno Torlao, a generous resident of the locality. Then Alejandro Baronda took the reign as Local Chief Executive from 1931 to 1934. From 1934 to 1937, Felix Lafuente became the Town Chief followed by Francisco Enage in 1938 to 1940 and later on Enrique Q. Enage led the town from 1941 to 1942. They were followed by Lorenzo Mendoza from 1942 to 1944. Honorato Agas Sr led his people from 1945 to April 15, 1986 except for one term 1952-1953 when he was defeated by Rosendo Eamiguel, a popular landlord of Barangay Villalon. The popular EDSA Revolution on February 25, 1986 brought an end to Agas‚Äô term and Victorio Loygos Sr was eventually appointed as the OIC Mayor from April 16, 1986 to May 1987. Engr. Rolando R. Amparado succeeded him by appointment from June 24, 1987 to November 30, 1987 followed by Marciano Batiancela Jr from December 1, 1987 until the newly elected Local Chief Executive in the person of Dr. Carlos C. Cotiangco Jr. assumed office on February 8, 1988. He has done tremendous accomplishment in the Metro-Calubian by accomplishing several infrastructure projects such as concreting of municipal and barangay roads, public markets, waiting sheds, completion of municipal hall, improvement of the drainage system , multi- purpose pavements and water works projects.

Climate History The name Capoocan comes from the dialect term \\"mapu-uk\\" which means obstructed or \\"obstaculizado\\" in Spanish. It lies along the shores of Carigara Bay - its people drawing sustenance both from the waters which give an abundant harvest of fish that find their way in the markets of Tacloban and Carigara, as well as in the fertile lands that end at the foot of Mount Minoro. Expansion efforts have been limited by the presence of Mount Minoro. The mountain obstructs and contains the town in its present site - forbidding further growth but protecting the town from the strong typhoons that have battered neighboring towns. In 1904, the town earned its independence from its mother municipality, Carigara. Apparently too young for such a difficult undertaking, Capoocan willingly returned to barrio status after a few years of determined but unsuccessful attempts at independence. On January 1, 1928, when it finally gathered strength and gained experience, Capoocan was granted municipal status again. It was ranked as a fifth class municipality at first but later on ascended to fourth class category. Its first town executive was Brigido Merelos. In 1931, Jose Pagar was elected President but his term was short since he was appointed municipal judge of Pastrana. It was Perfecto Pilapil who succeeded him to serve the un-expired term. In 1935, Solos M. Hernandez was elected Mayor. He was re-elected in 1939 but he died at the outbreak of World War II. From 1867 when Capoocan was a \\"visita\\" of Carigara, the town has shown remarkable increase in population. After 38 years on its own as a town, Capoocan has grown into its present site - 17 barrios stretching to as far as 30 kilometers from the town proper and a \\"poblacion\\" that shows promise.

Gara was said to have come from Borneo, one of the unnamed companions of the ten datus who landed in Panay and purchased that island from the Ati (or Aeta) chief Marikudo. Later, for phonetic convenience, Kangara became Kalgara and when the Spaniards came, they called the place Carigara; hence its present name. Carigara is the first town established in Eastern Visayas. Its town fiesta which is celebrated every 16 July, commemorates the day of the first coming of the Spaniards dated July 16, 1569. The fiesta that is celebrated almost the entire month of July was dubbed as the Fiesta of the Holy Cross.

Climate History In the early time of the Spanish regime, the section where the Jaro is situated today was a lush forest enjoying its primitive freedom undisturbed by human beings. In those days, struggles between Christianity and Mohammedanism took place. Datu Buisan and Sirungan led one of the Moro expeditions. They came to the Visayas leading a fleet of colorful moro vintas razing Christian towns to the ground, killing the inhabitants and taking some as slaves. Christians had to unite against the invaders and this was how Jaro came into being. There were two Leytenos known far and wide for their skill with the native arms and bravery in wars. These two men were Bonsilao of Ormoc and Sinirungan of Dagami. These two men were so strong that the people concluded that they possessed supernatural powers. This belief was strengthened by the fact that they managed to drive the Moros away. Later, the two men decided to settle in a centrally located place where they could easily give aid to the beleaguered Christians especially the inhabitants of Balugu, Kalgara and the neighboring towns. An ideal place was finally found. This was atop a hill and this same hill is where the parochial church of Jaro is situated. As time went by, the place was consequently cleared and homes were built. Small crooked paths were widened and thus a town was born. The legendary background of this municipality has been for the most part connected with the surging Cabayongan River, which crisscrosses the town. This river had served the inhabitants in many ways, becoming as it were the flesh and blood of the community. As historical data points out, the municipality of Jaro was once called ‚ÄúSalug,‚Äù a proximate location to the Cabayongan River. Its fertile soil and abundant fruit-bearing trees contributed immensely to its early growth and expansion. It became a ‚Äúvisita‚Äù because of the periodic baptismal visit regularly made by the priest coming from the town of Barugo. This ‚ÄúVisita‚Äù became the second name of the municipality of Jaro. In later years, the village became the centrifuge of people coming from the outlying districts and regions due to a running well found at the foot of the hill where the present church now stands, the water of which was believed to be medicinal because of herbs whose roots were leading to the well. The old folks termed the mixture of the herbs from the hill as ‚ÄúHaro,‚Äù a medicinal potent drug supposed to cure all kinds of afflictions and diseases. People from near and far municipalities flocked to this place to be treated. Thus, ultimately, the word ‚ÄúHaro‚Äù became a by-word among the people and later on used to denote the name of the place when it became a municipality in 1810. When the Spaniards came, ‚ÄúHaro‚Äù was transcribed as ‚ÄúJaro‚Äù. Notre Dame of Jaro, a Catholic school run by the sisters of the Oblates of Notre Dame, is located in Jaro.

Geography A rural town approximately south of Tacloban City, Javiert is located between the boundaries of Baybay on the west side and MacArthur and Abuyog towns, along the Leyte Gulf. It has a very narrow coastlines and coastal plains facing the Pacific. =Barangays= Javier is subdivided politically into 28 barangays as per RA 3422 - An Act Creating the Municipality of Bugho as an independent municipality in the Province of Leyte, enacted on June 18, 1961. =Climate= History The municipality of Javier, Leyte was formerly barrio Bugho of the municipality of Abuyog, Leyte. Bugho is a contraction of the dialect term \\"Binogho\\" (from local dialect root word \\"buho\\"), meaning a small clearing within a forest area. Settlers at about the turn of the century cultivated this small patch of land. Among the earliest known settlers was Macario Cultura, a native of Burauen, Leyte who is believed to have led his friends and relatives to farm the fertile soil of the area, then a virgin forest. Later, as the settlement grew, it became a sitio of barrio Pinocawan, and established barrio since the Spanish occupation. Sometime in 1914, Daniel Falcon Javier of Consolacion, Sogod, Southern Leyte and a former teacher and principal of Cebu Normal School of Cebu City in the early 1900s came to explore the surrounding area of the new settlement. At that time he just came from Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte where he started extensive farming activities since 1908 after his resignation as principal at the Cebu Normal School. A malaria plague in Cabadbaran, however, inflicted a heavy death toll among his people so that he had to explore other suitable areas until he came upon Bugho. Impressed by the fertility of the soil, he started staking out his claims in Bugho and moved out from Cabadbaran completely. Subsequently, Daniel married Dolores Mercado Veloso, also of Consolacion, Sogod, Southern Leyte, and settled in Bugho naming his settlement as Camalig. He initiated projects in the community where he was readily accepted as the teacher, Daniel Javier's concern was to educate the people. He opened a school in 1918 on land donated by Pedro Abordo with Leona Valles as the first teacher. Daniel Javier was a dedicated man without vices and he led the people in community activities to improve their working habits, eradicate superstition that hampered progress and introduced the use of vaccines and medicines. He also prevailed upon the people to accept the modern and progressive ways of agriculture. The community rapidly progressed as people from Cebu particularly from Argao and Bohol came in droves at the invitation and assistance of Mr. D.F. Javier who helped them legally acquire land-holdings. The people from Argao led by Pedro Gacera of Barrio Talaytay of that town settled at the west side of what is now Barrio Binulho. A bigger school had to be built because of the size of the community and so Mano Daniel (as the people fondly called Daniel F. Javier) invited Mr. Waters, an American Superintendent to help them build one. Mr. Waters readily agreed and together with Evaresto Retucsan donated a new site for the school with the people contributing a counterpart of 1,000.00 Pesos with the release of 7,000.00 pesos from the government. The people through the \\"Bayanihan\\" system furnished most lumber requirements. Corn, abaca & coconut were the main products of the community. Mano Daniel introduced irrigation utilizing the abundant water resources. It became a progressive community and was the center of trade among the neighboring barrios. In the 1939's it was among the contenders for township with barrios Palale and MacArthur. Since Mano Daniel's leadership was recognized by the provincial and district politicians, he used this influence to bring community improvements. Bugho was not only among the centers of resistance activities but also as evacuation centers during the Second World War. Food and other resources continued to be readily available and the local people supported the guerrilla movement. After the war, guerrilla remnants turned into organized banditry as Bugho still the center of these activities. However, the people continued to work in their farms and production was boosted with the evacuees helping them. One of the rice grainery of Poblacion Coconut, rice, abaca and ginger became the main products. Although organized banditry still existed and peace and order was not fully restored yet, the people were not deterred in their desire to become an independent municipality. During the mid-1950s, with the help of Attorney Higino A. Acala, Sr the \\"Bugho for Municipal Movement\\" was organized with Felomino Mercado, Pedro Gecera, Angel Caminong, Ambrocio Novio, Bernardino Tisado and Julia Brosas among its leaders. On December 18, 1959 at the initiative of Mayor Catalino Landia, the municipal council of Abuyog was convened to a session at Bugho endorsing by way of Resolution No. 7 to convert Bugho into an independent municipality of Abuyog to include the barrios of Caraya (Caraye), Ulhay, Tambis, Comatin, Caranhug, Talisayan and Manarug among many others. House Bill No. 2895 sponsored by Congressman Veloso of the 3rd District of Leyte and co-sponsored by Speaker Daniel Z. Romualdez of the 1st district passed through the Senate and became Republic Act 3422 creating the municipality of Bugho in June 1961. The first Municipal election was on November 12, 1963 and on January 3, 1964, the following officials were elected: Ambrocio Novio - Mayor, Felimon Tano - Vice Mayor, Vicente Rellin, Ruperto de Luna, Ruperto Villamor, Hidulfo Malasaga, Pastor Dingal, Eutiquiano Badique as councilors. It began its operations as a 7th class municipality. Local high value commercial crops In December 1965, the municipal Council unanimously approved a resolution to change the name of the municipality of Bugho to Javier, in honor of the late Daniel Falcon Javier, who died in Consolacion, Sogod in 1957. In 1970, the seat of government was finally transferred to the present site on a building constructed through the efforts of Congressman Artemio Mate. In 1972, the son of the late Daniel F. Javier, Domingo V. Javier, was elected Mayor. Within a few months after his assumption of office and before Martial Law, road networks were vastly improved. Thirty eight years later, the decades-old political leadership of the Cua's was challenged when businessman Leonardo \\"Sandy\\" Javier, Jr. ran as Mayor in 2010. His desire to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù blessings has pushed him to serve his hometown, concentrating his efforts on converting the poor municipality into a model town that would be emulated not only in the region but in the whole country. However, he was overwhelmingly victorious against his rival during the local election held that same year.

The film is about a fictional situation in which terrorist cells have made several attacks in New York City. The film stars Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, and Bruce Willis. Plot FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and his Lebanese American partner, Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub), intervene at the hijacking of a bus fully loaded with passengers, which contains an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists escape. The FBI receives demands to release Sheikh Ahmed (Ahmed Ben Larby) bin Talal, a radical Iraqi cleric who was suspected to have ordered the earlier bombing at the American embassy in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia who was captured and extracted while going to Lebanon by a group of American clandestine operators of Lebanese-American ancestry in the introductory scene of the film, who was then imprisoned in an undisclosed location after being extracted while the U.S. Government prepared to prosecute him for his role in the barracks bombing. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with Central Intelligence Agency agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), as he takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Later, another terrorist threat is made and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus is bombed. The feds captures a man named Samir Nazhde (Sami Bouajila), who admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The terrorist incidents escalate, including the bombing of a bus and a crowded theater, a hostage-taking at an elementary school, and the destruction of One Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, with over 600 casualties. In spite of objections, the President of the United States declares martial law and the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division, under the command of Major General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis), occupies and seals off Brooklyn in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently, all young men of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr., are rounded up and detained in Downing Stadium. Haddad resigns in outrage. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the Army and the profiling of the Arabs; the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings. Hubbard and Kraft, now revealed to be an agent named Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini (Amro Salama). Devereaux's men torture and kill Husseini in the course of the interrogation. Afterward, Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini revealed nothing of value because of the principle of compartmentalized information. Sickened, Bridger finally admits that she provided training and support to militants opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime, working with Samir to recruit and train the followers of the Sheikh. After the U.S. cut their funding and left them exposed, she took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by Hussein's forces, and arranged for them to escape to the United States, ultimately leading to the present situation as they turn their bomb making and covert skills on the country that now holds their leader. Sharon and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with the final terrorist cell. Hubbard also convinces Haddad to return to the FBI. A multi-ethnic peace march demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, \\"there will never be a last cell.\\" He straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate among the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to prevent him leaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the abdomen as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard and Haddad kill Samir but despite their best efforts the pair can only watch as Bridger succumbs to her wound after managing to recite certain lines of the second half of the Lord's Prayer and concluding with \\"Inshallah\\" - the Arabic phrase \\"God Willing\\". Hubbard, Haddad, and their team raid Devereaux's headquarters to make an arrest for the torture and murder of Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the War Powers Resolution the authority vested in himself by the President supersedes that of the court which issued the arrest warrant. Deveraux then commands his soldiers to aim their assault rifles at the agents, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all of his predecessors have fought and perished for. Devereaux finally submits and then gets arrested. Martial law ends and the detainees, including Haddad's son, are given their freedom.

Rotten Tomatoes awards the film a score of 44% based on 62 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of four, writing that director Edward Zwick does a good job with crowd scenes, but criticizing it as clumsy. Bruce Willis won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performances in this film, Armageddon, and Mercury Rising. =Box office = The film grossed $40,981,289 in North America and $75,691,623 in other territories on a budget of $70 million. = Controversy = When the film opened, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee came out against the film. Its spokesman Hussein Ibish said \\"The Siege is extremely offensive. It's beyond offensive. We're used to offensive, that's become a daily thing. This is actually dangerous.\\" He thought it was \\"Insidious and incendiary\\" because it \\"reinforces stereotypes that lead to hate crimes.\\" Ibish acknowledged that Arab terrorists did, in fact, bomb the World Trade Center in 1993, but said that Arab and Islamic groups are upset by \\"the very strong equation between Muslim religious practices and terrorism. ...[Thanks to this film] Every time someone goes through the Muslim ablution, the ritual washing of hands everybody does before they pray five times a day, that image is the announcement to the viewer of the presence of violence.\\" Echoing such criticism, the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations protested the insinuation that \\"Muslims have total disregard for human life.\\" The groups were \\"faxing and calling news organizations on a regular basis\\" to voice their concerns. Director Edward Zwick had met with Arab Americans, who suggested that the story be changed to mirror the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, when Arabs were immediately assumed responsible. This idea was rejected. Zwick noted that The Sieges villains also include members of the U.S. government, and dismissed the criticism, saying: In a September 2007 interview, screenwriter Lawrence Wright attributed the film's failure at the box office to Muslim and Arab protests at theaters playing the film, but also claimed that it was the most rented movie in America after the September 11 attacks. Scholar Alexandra Campbell quoted from former Guantanamo Bay detention camp captive Tarek Dergoul when she compared the fictional demonization and extrajudicial abuse of Muslims in the film and the abuse that Dergoul described in his first post-repatriation interview. On July 12, 2006 the magazine Mother Jones provided excerpts from the transcripts of a selection of the Guantanamo detainees. Yunis Abdurrahman Shokuri was one of the detainees profiled.

Carl Lindhagen holding his May Day sign saying: Alla folks frihet ‚Äì Hela v√§rldens fred ‚Äì avrustning √∂verallt. (All people's freedom ‚Äì World peace ‚Äì Disarmament everywhere.) Carl Albert Lindhagen (17 December 1860 ‚Äì 11 March 1946) was a Swedish lawyer, socialist politician, and pacifist. Carl Lindhagen was the Chief Magistrate (borgm√§stare) of Stockholm 1903‚Äì1930 (i.e. a legal position, not mayor). Life Carl Lindhagen was born in Stockholm. He was the son of Albert Lindhagen and the brother of Anna Lindhagen and Arthur Lindhagen. He studied law in Uppsala. As a lawyer, Lindhagen participated as adviser for the executives of the testament of Alfred Nobel. He was the secretary of the Nobel Committee in 1899. And at times he was suggested as a nominee to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, for his anti-militarism commitments. He started his political career in the Liberal party, which in the time before democracy was considered a radical movement. He joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1909, when he was already almost 50 years old. He soon joined the leftist opposition against the party leader Hjalmar Branting. The left-wing was headed by the young Communist Zeth H√∂glund, and in 1917 the group broke away from the mother party and formed the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden (SSV). Lindhagen fought for democracy, women's rights and better conditions for the working class and working farmers. He was also an advocate for better conditions for the indigenous Sami people in northern Scandinavia. Carl Lindhagen is known for his work for women's rights, and put forward a number of suggestions for the improvement of women's rights in the Swedish parliament, the most noted being that of women suffrage. In 1902, two motions regarding women suffrage reform were presented to the Swedish Parliament. One was from the Minister of Justice Hjalmar Hammarskj√∂ld, who suggested that married men be given two votes, as they could be regarded to vote in place of their wives as well. The other motion was presented by Carl Lindhagen, who suggested women suffrage. The Hammarskj√∂ld suggestion aroused anger among women's rights activists, who formed a support group for the Lindhagen motion. On 4 June 1902, National Association for Women's Suffrage (FKPR) was founded, which became the start point of the organized women suffrage movement in Sweden.Barbro Hedwall (2011).

(Swedish) As the chief magistrate of Stockholm, Carl Lindhagen, together with Ture Nerman and Fredrik Str√∂m, was part of a small delegation that greeted Lenin during his short visit in Stockholm in April 1917. The Swedish Communists took Lenin to the PUB department store where they bought him a brand new suit so he would look good and clean coming back home to revolutionary Petrograd. Carl Lindhagen originally supported Lenin and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, but he was also a pacifist and disagreed with some aspects of Communism. In 1921, he opposed the adoption of the Twenty-one Conditions of the ComIntern, and was thus expelled from SSV. He and fellow expellees formed a rump SSV. In 1923 he, along with the rest of his party, rejoined the Social Democratic Party.  Lindhagen and Esperanto  Lindhagen was a longtime supporter of the international language Esperanto. From 1911, he addressed the Swedish parliament almost every year about the idea of an international language. In 1928 he clearly proposed Esperanto. As a result, in 1929, 1930 and 1931 the Swedish parliament voted a sum of 2900 kronas for instructional Esperanto courses. He also participated in presenting the Esperanto course of Andreo Cseh for Swedish parliamentarians. He gave the opening speech during the 1927 World Congress of Esperanto in Danzig, and also spoke during an instructional session during the 1934 Congress. Personal life He married the first time in 1883 and his wife died after long sickness in 1902. He remarried in 1904 and had two children with his new wife, Jenny Lindhagen.

La Paz is politically subdivided into 35 barangays. Climate History In the 1870s, a sitio was formed, and a chapel was built there before 1886. The chapel was called \\"rosaryohan.\\" Spanish missionaries visited this place to teach the natives the doctrine. However, the people had to go to Dulag for the Holy Week and days of obligation in order to attend mass. Until then, the sitio was named Cabadyangan. When the question of official name came up, the people unanimously selected the name \\"La Paz\\", in honor of their patroness. The first hermana mayor was Victoriano Relano in 1908 when the first celebration of the fiesta in honor of the \\"Nuestra Senora de la Paz y Buen Viaje\\" was held. In 1903, La Paz was made a barrio of Burauen. Capitan Estefanio de Paz was the first teniente del barrio. Three leaders went to Manila to petition to the central government to raise La Paz to the status of a municipality. With the help of provincial leaders, La Paz was declared a fourth class town in 1918. On July 14, 1942, the Japanese forces invaded La Paz. A company of soldiers occupied the town with their garrison at the central school building. Because guerrillas constantly harassed them, the troops stayed in La Paz for only three weeks. However, one month later, more troops came. They constructed strong trenches around the school site. The Japanese abolished existing political parties and formed the \\"Kalibapi.\\" They organized the local government and appointed a puppet mayor. The Japanese tried to control the whole population of La Paz and organized the neighborhood associations in the poblacion as well as in the barrios. Schools were opened with emphasis on Nippongo, the Japanese language and the Asiatic ideologies. Guerrillas infiltrated the town to learn about the enemy strength that was considered important information for the coming liberation. Many La Paznons risked their lives on these dangerous missions.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology It was said that the Spaniards once saw the flaming red of the flame trees that dotted the shores of Matalom Beach and the scenic Canigao Island and asked the natives the local dialect for \\"hermosa\\" or beautiful. The natives answered \\"Matahum\\" or \\"Matalom.\\" This was the origin of the town's name. Barangays Matalom is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. Climate History Before Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines, a sea-faring people lived along the banks of the Matalom River and also on the islet of Canigao (formerly Comigao). In the middle of the 19th century, the townspeople of Matalom constructed their own parish church, convent, school, and public buildings through their own efforts. These were all accomplished with the leadership of Spanish Friar Leonardo Celes Diaz and Capitan Calixto Pil believed to be the founder and first president of the town. Leadership in the town's administration may be divided into three regimes: Spanish, American and Postwar (Philippine Independence). The first president of Matalom during the Spanish regime was Capitan Calixto Pil. Succession to the chair of president was patterned after the original dynasty set up by the natives, by Pal and Pil families. Thus, after Kapitan \\"Itong\\" (Cpt. Calixto Pil) his son followed. Next in line was Kapitan \\"Osting\\" (Cpt. Agustin Pil) then Kapitan \\"Kulas\\" (Cpt. Nicolas Pal), then Kapitan \\"Bentoy\\" (Cpt. Ruberto Pal), the last president before the transition period from Spanish to American regimes. The council members were then called, \\"Guinhaupan,\\" acknowledged leader in settlements, now barrios or sitios. The transition from the American regime to the time the Philippines obtained its independence saw Jeremias Pal re-elected alcalde in 1937 until the outbreak of World War II. The dark days of the Japanese occupation had Antonio Olo as the \\"puppet mayor\\". The restoration of the civil government after the war saw the appointment of Primitivo Gopo as the municipal mayor of Matalom.

The town was created in 1954 from the barrios of Mayorga, Andres Bonifacio, Talisay, San Roque, Burgos, Liberty, Union, Ormocay, Wilson, and the southern portion of barrio of Cogon Bingcay which were then a part of Dulag. History Mayorga at first was a barrio under the municipality of Dulag. The name first appeared in the record of localities in 1865 when Capitan Lorenzo de Paz, gobernadorcillo of Dulag, created the barrio. The name was suggested by Fr. Victoriano Sela, a Franciscan Friar and the parish priest of Dulag at the time. Originally the name was Mallorca, the name of the native town of Fr. Sela. The name presumably suggests the presence of palm trees in the locality, as the town of Mallorca in Spain was famous for its luxurious growth of palms. However, the natives found some difficulty in pronouncing the name. Whether the natural evolution and popular usage corrupted the name \\"Mallorca\\" into the present \\"Mayorga,\\" or whether the transformation was sanctioned by official decree motivated by phonetic convenience is not known. Nevertheless, the original \\"Mallorca\\" has evolved into its present name. Barangays Mayorga is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.

History Located south of Ormoc City, facing the Camotes Islands and Camotes Sea, Merida is nestled at the Westside of Ormoc City where agriculture, to include fishing is the major livelihood among the populace. A tradition and a rich heritage since the Spanish regime is a strong and lasting heritage to San Isidro Labrador sustained by the inhabitants tracing back from the original settlers up to the present. Since the Spanish conquest, the Meridanhons faithfully adopted the humble farmer, San Isidro Labrador, especially that agriculture is the dominant economy of the locality. The town was formerly situated in a place now known as Betaug. It was then called ‚ÄòSiapun after a river near the settlement. The town used to be a barrio of Ormoc. In 1860, however, the barrio was organized as a town and was promulgated in 1867 by Domingo Fernandez, the District Governor of the Province of Leyte. The first Spanish overseer nostalgically named it Merida after his native city in Spain which, like their own, lies along the bank of a river in the river Guardiana The first leader of the town government was German Justo, succeeded by Blas Bohol, and then Leonardo Macion and Teodoro Cabiling commonly called Captain Doro. Other town notables were Rufino Santiago, Alejo Ugsad, Nicolas Gumba, Ramon Lamoste Inong, Teodoro Laurel, Cipriano Macion, Antonio Francisco, Semon Sangan and Romualdo Boholst, all who served as Governadorcillo during the Spanish time. Merida was formally included in the parish of Ormoc, and only became independent parish in 1918. The following were the Parish Priests of Merida during the Spanish time: Fr. Ramon Abarca, Fr. Eduardo Alarcon, Fr. Lino Codilla and Fr. Diego Paras. Along the coast, Merida lies between the City of Ormoc and the progressive town of Isabel, 17 kilometers to the south. Concrete roads and bridges link Merida with adjacent towns and city direct to the capital city of Tacloban. It may be noted that Isabel, formerly named ‚ÄúQuiot‚Äù was made municipality by the Spaniards in 1850 which lasted 52 years and was merged into the town of Merida by virtue of Act No. 954 of the Philippine Commission. However, through the help of Ex-Senator Carlos S. Tan and Pres. Manuel A. Roxas, it was restored as a municipality by virtue of Rep. Act No. 191 of 1947, of the congress of the Philippines and Proc. No. 49, and named ‚ÄúIsabel‚Äù after the wife of the Senator. The newly appointed officials headed by Galicano Ruiz were inducted to office by the late Deputy Gov. Cipriano Macion of Merida.

According to the , it has a population of people.  Geography  The terrain of Palompon, which is generally sloping, limits the agricultural potential of the municipality. The dominant soil type (Faraon clay) is suited mainly for marginal upland crops, such as bananas, coconuts, and sweet potatoes. The destruction of the forest and critical watershed an area contribute to ongoing soil erosion and poses a major threat to the water supply of the town and its barangays. =Barangays= Palompon is politically subdivided into 50 barangays, 10 of which are poblacion barangays with an area of approximately 1 square kilometer; the other forty 40 barangays are distributed along the coastline and in the interior rural and mountainous areas. =Climate=  History  Along the strip of fertile coast, the community was founded circa 1620 and originally named Hinablayan. Fish, sea shells and other marine products abounded. People fished along the shore with arrows tied to vines. Its abundance attracted not only migrants but also Moro raiders from the south. Legend tells that local defenders used to hang the dead bodies of Moros on tree branches, so that the place come to be known as Hinablayan (from the word sablay which means \\"to hang\\"). The legend continues that when the Spaniards came they saw floating at the bay a cluster (pong pong) of mangrove propagules locally known as \\"Tungki\\", they decided to change the name of Hinablayan to Paungpung, after the cluster of mangrove propagules to erase the bloody memory of the Moro raiders. Gradually the name evolved to Palompong, then to Palumpun, and its current spelling of Palompon sometime in 1700 or 1800. It is said that cluster later got stuck to the shoal until they grew up as trees, forming an islet which is Tabuk Island today. In 1737, Jesuit missionaries arrived and built the first chapel which was later burned during a Moro raid. It was rebuilt and, as a refuge from attack, the chapel was enclosed with piled stones, with a \\"cota\\" along the frontage. When the people saw Moro vintas coming, the big church bell would ring the alarm and people rushed inside the church, fighting back with bows and arrows and spears. The place assumed the role of cabeceria of all the municipalities in the north-western side of Leyte during the Spanish regime. At that time Palompon was under the parish of Hilongos. The parish priest visited the place occasionally for marriage, baptism and masses. Old cannon of Palompon The Jesuits, later succeeded by the Augustinians, built the present church with 300 natives, who were forced labor without pay. If one or some of the laborers were unable to work, they were substituted by others just to maintain the quota every day for the next thirty years. The structure soon became a landmark of Palompon, reputed to be the oldest church in Leyte. On November 12, 1784, Palompon obtained its parochial independence from Hilongos. Sometime in late 17th century, there was a nine-day battle between the Palomponganons and Moro raiders during which the residents rushed to the stone church (newly completed at that time) and took refuge for more than a week. The Moros suffered losses in that encounter and were defeated. A cannon in the town's plaza is a relic of that battle.Manuel Artigas de Cuerva ‚ÄúResena de la Historia de la Provincia de Leyte‚Äù Ormoc remained part of Palompon parish from 1784 until 1851, when finally it was declared as an independent parish. Villaba and Matag-ob were both part of the territorial jurisdiction of this town as well before they obtained their municipio (pueblo) status. In 1957 the barrios of Santo Rosario, Santa Rosa, Balagtas, San Vicente and Mabini were separated from the municipality of Palompon and constituted into Matag-ob. Demographics Municipal Hall In the , the population of Palompon, Leyte, was people, with a density of . Palompon has a very young population with 43.5% total population are less than 20 years old. The population is equally balanced between females (50.3%) and males (49.7%). Palompon is composed of 50 barangays, 10 of which is located in the poblacion while the remaining 40 are located along the coastal and interior parts of the municipality. Some 26% of the population resides in the poblacion barangays while the remaining 74% are found in rural areas. Palompon is densely populated, with 3.92 persons per hectare. This is much higher than the population density of Region VIII, which is 1.56 persons per hectare. However, population density is not evenly distributed among the barangays. The poblacion barangays are the most densely populated (Central ‚Äì II is ranked first at 682 persons per hectare) while the hinterland barangays are the most sparsely-populated (Hinagbuan ranked last with 1.22 persons per hectare). Palompon had a literacy rate of 91.30% as per 1990 census. The municipality has as extensive educational system consisting of 45 elementary schools, 7 high schools and one state college (Palompon Institute of Technology), which is a well-known and respected institution in the province. The population growth rate has been relatively slow, averaging less than 1.4% annually during the period 1980-91, although this increased to 2.12% from 1991-95. The average percentage of deaths over births is 26.15 per 1,000, which is approximately one death rate and relatively slow increase in population, there appears to be a net out-migration of residents from Palompon. This is consistent with the overall trend of out-migration in Region VIII. One form of out-migration occurs when Palomponganons leave their hometown for Cebu, Manila or abroad where they can find well-paying jobs. The lack of well-paying job opportunities in Palompon encourage many skilled people (e.g. seamen, carpenters, contractors, etc.) to leave the town. The education programs offered by the PIT, which focus on marine transportation and engineering, are also in favor of this trend. A second (and more serious) form of out-migration occurs within Palompon itself where residents from the hinterland barangays migrate to the poblacion barangays. Many of these migrants join the rank of subsistence fisher folk while others become tricycle (or ‚Äútrisikad‚Äù) drivers. The in-migration of these upland dwellers has given rise to slum communities, particularly in the poblacion barangays of Ipil‚ÄîI, Ipil-II and Lili-on. The crime rate in Palompon is very low compared to other towns in the Province and, so far, most are not considered serious. However, police officials expressed concerns that criminality may be on the rise because of the progress being experienced by the town, which is attracting an increasing number of in-migrants to Palompon. About 54% of the total population of Palompon belongs to the labor force, totaling 27,376 individuals. Of these, 13,963 are males (51%) while 13,413 are females (49%). Only about 1,390 workers (5% of total labor force) are employed in the so- called formal sector, which includes the schools, local government unit, national government agencies, the Pheschem Industrials Corporation (150 direct and 250 contractual) and the market vendors (120 with stalls). The remaining 95% of the labor force are employed in agriculture, fishing and the growing service sector within the poblacion of the town. Some 15,096 residents of Palompon (about 30% of total population) have been identified as living below the poverty line. The poverty line in Palompon has been set at a monthly income of ‚Ç± 2,699.00 for a family with six members. = Language = Cebuano (Kana dialect) is widely spoken in Palompon but you may hear a few who speak Waray-waray as there are students coming from different towns/cities from the eastern part of the region that are native Waray-waray speakers.  Economy  Rizal Street, 2016 In general, the growth and development of agriculture and the rural sector in the province of Leyte and including Palompon, has been hampered by the following problems: 1) poor and inadequate infrastructure; 2) limited access to land, production inputs, credits and other resources among small agricultural producers; 3) inadequate post-harvest facilities; 4) inadequate government support; and 5) lack of irrigation facilities. Palompon has substantial food consumption requirements in cereals (rice and corn), meat, eggs, milk and products, fish, sugar, vegetables, root crops and others. Despite the LGU's plans to stimulate agricultural production to meet the above demand, Palompon must import many of the above commodities (mainly from Cebu) in near future. Palompon is mainly a coconut-producing area with 1,640 hectares devoted to coconut cultivation (30% of agricultural area). In contrast, rice is grown on only 794 hectares (394 Irrigated, 250 Rained and 150 Upland). The irrigated farms average about 3.5 metric tons (70 canvas) per hectare per crop while the rained lowland and upland areas produce 2.5 metric tons (50 canvas) and 1.25 metric tons 25 canvas), respectively per hectare per crop. Corn production (500 hectares) is low because farmers prefer to plant the traditional varieties that taste although these have lower yields. Farm sizes in the upland barangays tend to be small, ranging from one-fourth to two hectares. Farmers tilling these lands are considered as the poorest farmers who migrate to the poblacion barangays during the ‚Äúslack period‚Äù from planting to harvesting in order to drive trisikads, hire themselves out as construction workers or go fishing. There is one potential for shifting agricultural production from the low to higher-value crops such as fruit trees and vegetables. To do this successfully, however, farm-to-market roads, irrigation and other physical infrastructure will be required. At present, only a few barangays have water from spring sources and communal irrigation systems; the rest rely only on the rain for water for their crops. The total area covered for distribution under the agrarian reform program is 2,784 hectares or about 50% of total agricultural lands. This covers 79% public land and 11% private land. Farm lot range from 0.2051 to 2.27 hectares. The major portion of Palompon farmlands are owned by small landowners 920 hectares or less) who reside in the Palompon farmlands are owned by small landowners are reportedly teachers who have invested their life savings are considered last priority for re-distribution under CARL and it is likely that many of these may eventually be exempted because of the current retention limits. = Fishing industry = The fish sanctuary project of the LGU has contributed greatly to maintaining the level of fish supply in the area. Fisher-folk constitute a major segment of the population in the 18 barangays of Palompon that have access to the sea. According to DA data, some 26% of the population (1,230 out of 4,683 households) in these 18 barangays are fisher-folk. However, this estimate of fisher-folk population includes only those with bancas and do not include fisher-folk who rent boats or hire themselves out as laborers to fisher-folk- boat owners. Of these fisher-folk who own boats, 25% have motorized bancas while 75% rely on manual paddling. Because of their ability to venture out into the sea, fisher-folk with motorized bancas earn ten times as much as their colleagues with non-motorized bancas. Marketing of fish in Palompon is organized around middlemen (local name: ‚Äúalpor‚Äô) who provide the fisher-folk with basic commodities and fishing supplies in exchange for the preferential right to buy their catch. The middlemen earns in two ways: 1) the basic commodities are priced at 10% higher than acquisition costs; and 2) the fish catch is priced lower by about 10‚Äì15% of the prevailing market price. = Commerce and trade = With the completion of ongoing port improvement and road construction efforts, Palompon will be in a strong position to enhance its role as the center of commerce and trade for the north-western towns of Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Villaba, Tabango and San Isidro. Despite the absence of these improvements, the cargo handled at the Palompon port has already posted a significant rise from 27,891.043 metric tons in 1993 to 47,474.724 metric tons in 1995. At the same time, Palompon, already ranked second in 1991 passenger traffic among four ports which include Maasin, Ormoc and San Jose, Samar. The existing market in the center of the poblacion, which is considered large for a town with the size of palompon, is testimony to the role of the municipality as a trading center for the north-western municipality of Leyte. A new and better planned public market may be required, however, once the port become fully operational. The existence of a large number of commercial establishments in Palompon including sari-sari stores, shipping companies, special services is further testimony to the role of the municipality as a center of commerce and trade. There are a number of flourishing labor-intensive industries within Palompon with the potential for expansion. Two of the more promising industries are 1) preparation of ‚Äúboneless dried danggit‚Äù in the barangays Buenavista, Plaridel and Cantuhaon, 2) mat-weaving in barangays Plaridel, Cruz, Duljugan, Cantuhaon, Tinabilan, Himarco, Sabang and Lomonon Attractions Kalanggaman Island *Kalanggaman Island ::A quiet and remote location ideal for the cruise ship passengers looking for a place to relax and unwind. It is for its magnificent sandbars, both stretching at the end of the island. Unlike other beach resorts, this island is not always crowded.

The bravery and undaunted valiant stanch against all odds of our forefathers to vanquish foreign invaders way back the \\"Moro Marauders\\" in the ancient times down to their collective participation to repeal the controversial atrocities of Spaniards, Americans, Japanese in the land had echoed to other municipalities in the Leyte Island. The historic places and sites of the ancient Palompon are still there for everyone to give a nostalgic focus. But due to the ramification of its former barangays to town-hood and even city-hood where geographical subdivisions followed and were made appurtenant, the present Palompon map has been trimmed down of some of its interesting locations that bespeak the rich and formidable historical accounts of the Palomponganons through the years. But in spite of the development process, still, Palompon is replete with historical sites and heritage that herald and relate to the present genre the town's glorious past. One of them is the Palompon Liberty Park (PLP). A full account on how this historical icon and location came to follow in the succeeding pages of this article. It was authored by a centenarian, Salud Esmero Reposar at 103 years old, who left the PLP legacy to us before she went home back to the Lord. Palomponganons are incontrovertibly religious people. This inheritance and burning passion for the religious life can be traced back in the olden times. The fact, that Palompon is one of the early few towns of ancient Leyte where the first mass of Christendom in the Philippines was held. The townspeople are predominantly Roman Catholics. There are at present 14 religious sects shepherding their respective pious faithful in town. Thus, with the given number multifarious religious sites and various displays are expected and worth for everyone's valued time. The Roman Catholic Church of Palompon which was built for 44 years and thereafter was formally founded on November 12, 1784, is considered the oldest church in Leyte. Hence, a blown up feature on it is highlighted on the succeeding pages for everyone's information, guidance, and a boon to religious fervor.

Geographically, it is in the southwestern part of Leyte, and about from Tacloban City. Its rice fields and coconut plantations are the main assets of the place. The climate is cool and the soil fertile. The water system at Tingib is designed to supply Tacloban and neighboring municipalities. =Barangays= Pastrana is politically subdivided into 29 barangays. =Climate=  History  Prior to incorporation as a separate municipality, Pastrana was part of the municipality of Dagami. Before the coming of the Spaniards, the settlement was called \\"Pamagpagan\\" because of the way the native inhabitants left their hair in disarray. In 1891, Captain Wenceslao Nielo, with the aid of a Spanish Franciscan friar by the name of Fr. Eusebio Ibanez, organized the settlement into a town and was transferred from Guinbaya-an to its present site. Father Ibanez blessed it with a holy mass. As a token of gratitude, the inhabitants called the town \\"Pastrana\\" in honor of Fr. Ibanez who was a native of Pastrana, Spain. Shortly afterwards, parochial schools were established. At this time, the unit of local administration was the pueblo which embraced a number of barrios. The first gobernadorcillo was Captain Wenceslao Nielo. He was assisted in the administration of the pueblo by the \\"Guinhaupan,\\" a group of men equivalent to the present councilors, by the \\"tenientes\\" and by the \\"Cabezas de barangay.\\" When the Philippine revolution broke out in 1898, the people fled to the mountains and for a time, the local government then headed by Andres Villablanca, was temporarily suspended. It was at this moment in the history of the town that Jorge Capili, a guerrilla leader, burned the whole town. By the year 1901, Gregorio Marquez was appointed municipal president. The Americans who occupied the whole country, stationed a detachment at Dagami. They came once in a while to Pastrana to look after the affairs of the little town. In 1903, the town was reverted into a barrio of Dagami due to inadequate finances. Pastrana for a time remained a barrio of Dagami. In 1912, Agaton Villablanca worked for the establishment of the barrio to a municipality so that its former status was finally regained. In gratitude, the people appointed Agaton Villablanca president. After five years when the first municipal election was held, Agaton Villablanca retained his leadership of the municipal government. When the Japanese occupied Pastrana in 1942, the people secretly fled to the mountains. The incumbent mayor also evacuated and his elder brother took his place. The Japanese did not stay long. The guerillas burned down the buildings and for some time there were no Japanese in the town. But in 1943, the Japanese returned, this time for long, for the soldiers constructed a garrison. The Japanese invaders ordered the civilians to live in the town proper. For two long years, the town residents suffered severely under the Japanese oppression. In 1944 when the American liberation forces drove out the Japanese, Francisco Villablanca, who was the pre-war mayor, automatically resumed his position and under him, the town was restored to its former status as a peaceful community. At present, Pastrana is fast progressing in the agricultural field because of the biggest gravity irrigation system in eastern Visayas, located at Barrio Tingib, lacing the whole municipality with irrigation canals. A direct road to Palo as well as feeder roads have been constructed. The Binaha-an Dam provides an ideal picnic site with the stately Amandawing mountain in the background.

The scope of the encounter in terms of warships, warplanes, and manpower involved is nothing short of astounding. The casualties borne by both warring parties are incomparable to other similar engagements, to say the least. It was, by all standards, a decisive victory for the American naval forces and could easily have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese Imperial Navy had the result been otherwise. The battle was waged in an attempt by the Japanese to thwart General Douglas MacArthur's bold return via the Leyte Landings on October 20, 1944, the second biggest amphibious invasion in modern history after the Normandy Invasion less than five months earlier. The Japanese naval forces organized three attack forces with the American landing armada in the Leyte Gulf as target. The largest attack group, organized hastily by the Japanese, was the Central Force headed by Admiral Kurita. This powerful force encountered a token fleet of American escort ships in the Philippine Sea off the island of Samar. Despite overwhelming superiority, the Japanese Central Force surprisingly retreated through the San Bernardino Strait. Part of the remnants of the Central Force was pursued and destroyed by American warplanes. There are six sunken Japanese warships in San Isidro Bay, northwest of Leyte Island. The warships were destroyed on or about the same period when the Battle for Leyte Gulf was waged. This paper will attempt to establish the circumstances that led to the sinking and destruction of these ships. It will try to find out if the ill-fated vessels were among the remnants of the Japanese Central Force which retreated after almost bringing the Leyte Landings of the Allied Forces to their doom. The Battle for Leyte Gulf was the most savage naval engagement of World War II. Barangays San Isidro is politically subdivided into 19 barangays.

Significance The word, pantheon derives from Greek œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒøŒΩ pantheon, literally \\"(a temple) of all gods\\", \\"of or common to all gods\\" from œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ pan- \\"all\\" and Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ theos \\"god\\". A pantheon of gods is a common element of polytheistic societies, and the nature of a society's pantheon can be considered a reflection of that society: Some well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the Sumerian gods and the Egyptian gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the ancient Greek religion and Roman religion. Post-classical polytheistic religions include Norse √Üsir and Vanir, the Yoruba Orisha, the Aztec gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as \\"mythology\\".Eugenie C. Scott, Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction (2009), p. 58. Evolution of pantheons Scholars such as Jaan Puhvel, J. P. Mallory, and Douglas Q. Adams have reconstructed aspects of the ancient Proto-Indo-European religion, from which the religions of the various Indo-European peoples derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion. An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of *dyƒìus, which is attested in several distinct religious systems. In many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time. Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek Titanomachia, and possibly also the case of the √Üsir and Vanir in the Norse mythos. Cultural exchange could lead to \\"the same\\" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the ancient Egyptian deity Osiris, which was later followed in ancient Greece. Max Weber's 1922 opus Economy and Society discusses tendency in the ancient Greek philosophers to interpret gods worshiped in the pantheons of other cultures as \\"equivalent to and so identical with the deities of the moderately organized Greek pantheon\\".Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (1922), p. 23. In other instances, however, national pantheons were consolidated or simplified into fewer gods, or into a single god with power over all of the areas originally assigned to a pantheon. For example, in the ancient Near East during the first millennium BCE, Syrian and Palestinian tribes worshiped much smaller pantheons than had been developed in Egypt and Mesopotamia.Robert Karl Gnuse, No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel (1997), p. 200. Weber also identified the link between a pantheon of gods and the development of monotheism, proposing that the domination of a pantheon by a particular god within that pantheon was a step towards followers of the pantheon seeing that god as \\"an international or universal deity, a transnational god of the entire world\\". The first known instance of a pantheon being consolidated into a single god, or discarded in favor of a single god, was with the development of the short-lived practice of Atenism in ancient Egypt, with that role being accorded to the sun god.Robert Karl Gnuse, No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel (1997), p. 167. A similar process is thought to have taken place with respect to the Israelite deity Yahweh, who, \\"as a typical West Semitic deity... would have four or five compatriot gods in attendance as he became the national high god\\". The concept of a pantheon of gods has been widely imitated in Twentieth-century fantasy literature and role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. These uses tend to borrow heavily from historical patterns. In these contexts, it is considered important for the writer to construct pantheon of gods that fits the genre, where the characteristics of the gods are in balance so that none of them is able to overwhelm the story, and so that the actions of the characters are not overwhelmed by the machinations of the gods.William Sims Bainbridge, eGods: Faith versus Fantasy in Computer Gaming (2013), p. 57. Extension of the concept into structures and celebrities alt=ancient temple fronted by eight huge pillars In order to avoid the difficulty of giving an exhaustive list of deities when devoting a temple or sacred building, a structure explicitly dedicated to \\"all deities\\" also came to be referred to as a \\"Pantheon\\".Edmund Thomas, \\"From the pantheon of the gods to the Pantheon of Rome\\", in Matthew Craske, ed., Pantheons: Transformations of a Monumental Idea (2004), p. 11. The best known of such structures is the Pantheon of Rome, first built by Marcus Agrippa as part of a complex created by him on his own property in the Campus Martius in 29‚Äì19 BC. The building standing today was constructed on the same site around 126 CE. It was dedicated to \\"all gods\\" as a gesture embracing the religious syncretism in the increasingly multicultural Roman Empire, with subjects worshipping gods from many cultures and traditions. The building was later renovated for use as a Christian church in 609 under Pope Boniface IV.John the Deacon, Monumenta Germaniae Historia (1848) 7.8.20, quoted in Since the 16th century, \\"pantheon\\" has also been used in a secular sense to refer to the set of a society's exalted persons‚Äîinitially including heroic figures, and later extending to celebrities, generally.Matthew Craske and Richard Wrigley, \\"Introduction\\", in Matthew Craske, ed., Pantheons: Transformations of a Monumental Idea (2004), pp. 1‚Äì2. Lord Byron drew this connection after viewing the busts of famous historical figures in the Roman Pantheon, writing in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage of how he wished to be at the center of an English Pantheon, and thereby associated with divinity.Clara Tuite, Lord Byron and Scandalous Celebrity (2015), pp. 140‚Äì141. The Pantheon \\"thus imbues the modern with the aura of the divine\\", and \\"models the interplay of ancient and modern forms of fame\\". This trend continued into modern times, with the word \\"pantheon\\" 'of or for the gods' being reflected in the journalistic meme that refers to financial titans as \\"Masters of the Universe\\". For example: Francis Ford Coppola has been described as a member of \\"that revered pantheon of independent movie directors, which broke the standard Hollywood studio mould as the 1960s expired\\".Simon Warner, Text and Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: The Beats and Rock Culture (2013), p. 452.

Geography =Barangays= Santa Fe is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. =Climate= History About thirty years ago, Santa Fe was just one of the biggest barrios of Palo, Leyte. In 1948, Juan R. Perez, a native of this barrio, was a private secretary. Inspired and prompted by Melquiades Almen, Julian Dagami, Jose Catada, Antonio Evalo, Eulogio Navarra and Maximo Postreto, all civic leaders and with the consent of Mayor Generoso Alvarado of Palo, House Bill No. 1918 was drafted and sponsored on May 6, 1948 on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Perez, creating Santa Fe a town. At first there was strong opposition from the residents of Palo as Santa Fe and other affected barrios were the main source of income for the town but the oppositionist were silenced by the budding leaders of Santa Fe. The bill was finally approved by the lower house and the Senate under the leadership of Senator Jose Avelino. However, politics intervened. While the bill was waiting for the signature of President Elpidio Quirino, there was a split of the party in power. Although President Quirino was the logical candidate for election, many leaders believed that Senate President Jose Avelino was the apparent successor to the presidency. Don Pio Pedrosa, then Secretary of Finance in the Cabinet of President Quirino was commissioned to sound out the political sentiments of the people of Santa Fe in that presidential election. His objective in visiting Santa Fe was to unite the leaders there so that it would be easy for him to secure approval of the bill pending the signature of President Quirino converting Santa Fe into a town. Those supporting the administration met Sec. Pedrosa in the old Martinez residence. Atty. Carlos Martinez was the leader of this group. Those supporting Senate President Jose Avelino, under the leadership of the private secretary of Congressman Juan Perez met Sec. Pedrosa in the public victory in the entire country. The bill creating Santa Fe into a town was vetoed. However, the yearnings, dreams and aspirations of this ambitious barrio was not to be denied for long. Smarting from the bitter lesson of disunity, fresh efforts were exerted to renew the campaign with more enthusiasm to convince the powers that Santa Fe should be made a free and independent town from Palo, in the name of progress. At this point, the warring political factions of the town were strongly united and determined to overcome all obstacles along the way. Under the guidance of Santa Ana, the patroness of this barrio, Don Pio Pedrosa forgave those who did not follow him in that presidential election. Upon his strong recommendation, President Quirino, by Executive Order No. 277 dated October 10, 1949, created Santa Fe, together with Tunga and Julita as new towns of Leyte. Santa Fe was then born as a free and independent town by presidential fiat and notably legislative action. On the eve of its traditional town fiesta, the residents under the leadership of Mayor Iluminado Martinez, one of the first councilors of Santa Fe in 1949 and dynamic parish priest Rev. Father Antonio Adre, in grateful remembrance and recognition, saluted the efforts of those who led in making Santa Fe a town out of several barrios of Palo. Its fertile fields and valleys abound with corn, camote and other root crops, while its rivers Kasili-on and Maslog are rich with fish, adequate in quantity to give food and sustenance to its ever-increasing population. The BANCOM projects in its northern periphery promises to be the rice granary of the town. Today there are 15 barangays in Santa Fe with an area of 5,567 hectares irrigated and planted with rice.

Students can use the computers for 10 hours monthly, free of charge. Inquirer.net, Poor town has modern library Tabango was a barrio of San Isidro, Leyte. Its early settlers came from the islands of Cebu and Bohol and from the towns of Villaba and Palompon. Later as the transportation improved same personage from the eastern side of Leyte Province found fortune in the place. These people were responsible in molding its culture. During the Second World War, the Barrio of Tabango was made as the seat of the Civil Government of the Municipality of San Isidro, Leyte, the civil authorities returned the seat of the Local Government to the Poblacion of San Isidro, Leyte In 1948, prominent residents of Tabango, took the opportunity offered by the late Jose L. Alvarez to work out in Manila thru Senate President Mariano Jesus Cuenco, the establishment of a new political unit. Documentation were initiated with the assistance of the Late Rosendo Homerez of Tacloban City, whose wife was native of Tugas, now a barangay of Tabango. Eventually, Executive Order No. 284 was signed by His Excellency President Elpidio Quirino on October 15, 1949 creating the Municipality of Tabango, Leyte. The first set of officials were appointed and sworn to office on January 16, 1950, to wit: Francisco Pastor (Municipal Mayor); Felomino Ocubillo (Municipal Vice Mayor); Adolfo Alvarez, Honofre Damayo, Potenciano Pijo, Mauricio Sevilles, Mateo Pastor (Councilmen). The doctrine in the case of Pelaez vs. the Auditor General, G.R. No. L-23825 promulgated on December 24, 1965, placed the Municipality of Tabango in a great dilemma. It was in this case that the Supreme Court ruled and declared certain orders creating municipalities unconstitutional on the ground that the creation of municipalities is an exercise of the legislative power. On this premise, creation and exercise of the Municipality of Tabango, Leyte was illegal. However, the cloud that darkened the juridical personality of Tabango as a municipal corporation disappeared with the introduction of House Bill No. 2042 during the seventh congress by the Congressman Marcelino R. Veloso, Representative of the 3rd District of Leyte. The bill proposed to create the municipalities of Almeria, Cabucgayan, Tabango and Culaba, with retroactive effect in order to validate the existence of the aforementioned municipal corporations. The bill was finally approved into law on June 17, 1972 as Republic Act 6488 retroactive on October 15, 1949. Origin of Tabango Tabango was originally a barrio named Tandaya. Most of its inhabitants lived near the seashore. One day, a man living in the barrio went to catch some crabs as swamps surrounded the place and crabs were abundant. Although he was an expert in catching crabs, he was accidentally bitten by a big one. A Spanish soldier happened to be near the place where the man was, so he came near and asked for the name of the place. The man bitten by the crab looked up and saw the soldier. Feeling the pain caused by the biting of the crab, he cried, ‚Äú Tabang mo,‚Äù which means help me. The soldier, thinking it was the name of then place, said, ‚Äú Ah, Tabango. ‚Äú The soldier repeated the word Tabango to his superiors and from that time on, the settlement was called Tabango. When the barrio was created a municipality, it retained its name. Demographics In the , the population of Tabango was people, with a density of .

According to the , it has a population of people. Tanauan is one of the oldest towns in Leyte dating back to the year 1710. It comprises 54 barangays. The town has been baptized the title of ‚ÄúCradle of the Intellectuals‚Äù or \\"Bungto Han Kamag-araman\\" since the Spanish colonial period. Tanauan is approximately 18 kilometers south of Tacloban City which is the Capital of the Eastern Visayas Region. It is bounded on the north by the Municipality of Palo, on the south by the Municipality of Tolosa, on the west by the Municipalities of Dagami and Tabon- Tabon, and on the east by San Pedro Bay. The town was heavily damaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in November 2013. Barangays Tanauan is politically subdivided into 54 barangays. Climate History =Pre- Spanish to Spanish Colonial Period= The town got its name from a towering Molave tree which served as a look-out tower. ‚ÄúTan-awan‚Äù or \\"Taran-awan\\" means to look-out in the Waray-Waray language. A person who serves as a look-out would watch for the feared Moro Pirates who would every now and then plunder and loot the settlements along the coast. The first known settlers of Tanauan were the family of Calanao with his wife and daughter. In 1661, Juanillo Siengco's family joined the Calanao family in the settlement along the bank of Bukid River at the foot of Adil Hill. By the time their settlements were more developed, the plundering of the Moros along the coast became intensified, and for their refuge, they built a stone-walled enclosure called \\"cuta‚Äù in the area of Buaya. In the course of time, Juanillo's son Josef, married Calanao's daughter, Sangod, and from the families of Juanillo Siengco and Calanao a tribe was formed which gave Tanauan its first tribal leaders. In 1710, the first town officials were appointed by the Spanish authorities during the Spanish reign in the Philippines. From 1710 up to the end of the Spanish Colonial period in 1900 and the start of American occupation, 47 persons became chief executives of the municipality. Tolosa, an adjacent town to the south of Tanauan, was once part of the municipality. Through the efforts of certain Magdalino Vivero and Domingo Camacho, they petitioned the Spanish government to grant Tolosa autonomy from the municipality. The petition was granted in 1852. =American Colonial Period to Japanese Occupation/ World War II= During the American Regime from 1901 to 1943, another set of municipal executives followed. When World War II broke out, Pedro A. Villegas was the incumbent Mayor. When the Japanese occupied the town, the incumbent Mayor Pedro Villegas and his secretary Janario Perez refused to serve the Japanese authorities. Thus, Rufo Cobacha was appointed Mayor by the Japanese and followed by Pedro Bulik who was eventually killed by the local guerillas. During the Japanese occupation, the town was burned by the guerillas in 1943. This unfortunate event destroyed the Municipal Building, including its records, and a lot of the big ancestral houses of Spanish Architecture along Calle Real. When the US Allied Forces stormed the town during the liberation of Leyte, it resulted in further destruction of the Municipal Hall ( Lian Chong Building) and the few remaining houses along Calle Real. However, few lives were lost during the assault as the town's people were warned beforehand and took refuge at the fortified Parish Church. Eugenio Avila, Sr. was the incumbent mayor when the Filipino and American Liberation Forces occupied the town. The US Sixth Army initially established its headquarters in Tanauan before the construction of the Airfield began in November 1944. Tanauan Airfield and its logistical importance during the liberation of the Philippines The X and XXIV Corps from the United States Sixth Army took part in the liberation of Tanauan from the Japanese Occupation Forces immediately after the US and Allied Forces landed at Leyte Beach in October 1944. Shortly thereafter, the United States Sixth Army, under the command of Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, established its headquarters in Tanauan. On November 15, 1944, a meeting was held at the site of the Sixth Army headquarters by the commanders and staff members of the major units who participated in the Luzon Campaign. While the US and Allied Forces were able to capture the Tacloban airstrip, the work to further develop it for US warplanes had been handicapped due to the heavy concentration of troops, supplies, and equipment in the area during the early stages of the operation. It was further hampered by insufficient supply of corals for surfacing the runway. Works were also simultaneously being done on the other two airstrips of Buri and San Pablo in the vicinity of Burauen, but it was halted in the latter part of November 1944. A considerable amount of time and effort have been expended in futile attempts to make these airfields usable. The inability of the Sixth Army to meet its construction dates on the airstrips prevented the US forces from stopping the flow of Japanese reinforcements and made it impossible for the Allied Forces to give sufficient land-based air support to the ground troops. In a desperate move to have an operational airfield, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger received permission from General Douglas MacArthur to construct an airfield in Tanauan. On November 28, 1944 the headquarters of the US Sixth Army was moved to Tolosa to start the construction of the airfield. The airfield site covers an area bounded on the north, south and west by Embarcadero River, and on the east by San Pedro Bay. The site was favorably chosen due to its generally flat terrain, good sandy surface, and satisfactory drainage - which proved to be an excellent location for an airfield. In December 1944, the field became operational. By December 25, 1944 there have been completed one runway with mat surfacing, one overrun, 90,000 square feet of warm-up area, 120,000 square feet of alert apron, one parallel taxiway, and 26 large dispersal areas. The control tower was code named ‚ÄúVelvet Tower.‚Äù All Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12) planes in Leyte, which played an important air support role for the Sixth Army, moved from Tacloban Airfield to Tanauan Airfield in December 1944. The airfield was used by the following units: Tanauan Airfield in July 1945 overlooking what is now known as Barangay San Roque (foreground) and Barangay Sto Nino (halfway to the south of the airfield). Ambao Hill is seen in the background. * 312th Bombardment Group (November 19, 1944 to February 10, 1945) * 340th Fighter Squadron (December 15, 1944) * 341st Fighter Squadron (December 14, 1944) * 460th Fighter-Interceptor Training Squadron (December 12, 1944) * 433rd Troop Carrier Group (January 19, 1945 to May 31, 1945) * 348th FG 460th Fighter Squadron (P-47) * 348th FG 340th Fighter Squadron (P-47) * 348th FG 341st Fighter Squadron (P-47) * 348th FG 342nd Fighter Squadron (P-47) * 25th Liaison Squadron (UC-78 and L-5). The airfield was abandoned following the withdrawal of the Allied Forces after the war and was later on referred to as \\"landing\\" by the locals. Today, a small remnant of this airfield can still be found in the area called \\"Pawa\\" located in Barangay Santo Ni√±o. Most of the remaining areas are now occupied by large business establishments such as the Pepsi Cola Tanauan Plant and New Leyte Edible Oil Manufacturing Corporation. The Tanauan Public Market, various commercial buildings and residential neighborhoods can also be found in the area. The airfield covers the area of what is now known as Barangay San Roque and Barangay Santo Ni√±o. Maharlika Highway (formerly known as Highway 1), which connects Eastern Visayas Region with Luzon to the north and Mindanao to the south, traverses through the former airfield site. =Post World War II to the present day= During the Liberation, Benito Saavedra was appointed Mayor by the newly restored Philippine government, then succeeded by the following in the order of incumbencies: * Rufo Cumpio -1945 * Dioniso Boco - 1946 * Pelagio O. Tecson ‚Äì 1946-1947 After the Liberation period, Dionisio Boco became the first Mayor, then succeeded again by Pelagio O. Tecson, Sr. In 1950, Barrio Haclagan, the site of the former US Airfield site, was renamed Santo Ni√±o. Pelagio Tecson, Sr. was the Mayor during the Martial Law Period (Martial Law in the Philippines and the so called ‚ÄúNew Society‚Äù) up to February 25, 1986 EDSA Revolution when Felix Cortez was appointed OIC Mayor by the new government. The local elections held on February 1, 1988 resulted in the election of Charles R. Avila. It was during his tenure that he was appointed as Administrator of the Philippine Coconut Authority in January 1991, and Vice Mayor Rodolfo Cinco succeeded him as Mayor. In the May 1992 synchronized elections for national and local officials, Atty. Roque Tiu won over five candidates for the mayoralty position. Tiu was the Chief Executive of the town until his second term ended in 1998. Mark Gimenez was elected Mayor from 1998 to 2001. During the 2001 elections, Atty. Roque Tiu ran again and won over Mark Gimenez. Roque Tiu became the mayor for three consecutive terms from 2001 to 2010. After Tiu completed his term, his vice mayor Agapito Pagayanan Jr. run for the mayoralty position during the 2010 national elections and got elected. He served from 2010 to 2013. During the 2013 mid-term elections, Pelagio Tecson, Jr. won over the incumbent mayor with just a small margin of votes.

It is one of the oldest Philippine traditional dances and originated in Leyte Province. The people of Leyte describe the tikling bird as one of the most unique in its movements - walking around and between the tree branches and some grass stems. This bird was named \\"tikling\\" from which the Tinikling dance got its name. Because of the creativeness of the Leytenos, they imitate this bird by using bamboo poles. In 2006, the attention of the then Mayor Roque Tiu was called regarding the 2005 Calendar of the Philippine National Oil Corporation entitled Sulyap (Glimpse) which highlighted the looking back into the home of Filipino culture and taking a glimpse into one‚Äôs roots in relation to moving forward in life. In the second page (March‚ÄìApril page), it featured the Tinikling with a brief description in Filipino: ‚Ä¶‚Äùang Tinikling ay nagmula sa Tanauan, Leyte. Isa ito sa mga pinaka-kilalang Pilipinong sayaw sa buong mundo. Ang pagkamalikhain ng mga taga Leyte ay nagbigay buhay sa simpleng galaw ng ibong tikling, kung saan nakuhaang pangalan ng sayaw. Sa Tinikling naipamalas ang likas na halina at pagiging masayahin na nabubukod-tangi sa mga Pilipino.‚Äù (Tinikling originated in Tanauan, Leyte. It is one of the best known Philippine dance. The creativity of the people of Leyte gave life to the simple movement of the tikling, birds from which the dance got its name, Tinikling. The dance mirrors the innate grace and joy of Filipinos). Since then, the municipal government of Tanauan requested historians and enthusiasts of culture and the arts to shed light on the issue so that the local government can initiate moves towards preserving the culture of the municipality, which has been baptized the title of ‚ÄúCradle of Intellectuals‚Äù (\\"Bungto Han Kamag-araman\\" in Waray-Waray) ever since the Spanish Regime. Another version of the story has it that the Tinikling really originated in Tanauan, Leyte, particularly in Barangay Kiling. The name ‚ÄúKiling‚Äù is also derived from the tikling bird. This version of the story has yet to be authenticated. Today, pinpointing the exact origin of this dance still remains a mystery. Vicente I. De Veyra, a native of Leyte, collected folk songs such as \\"Tinikling\\" in his book Mga Ambahan. =Skimboarding= Tanauan is recognized as the ‚ÄúSkimboarding Capital of the Philippines\\". It is told by tradition that skimboarding was first introduced in Tanauan in 2000, when an American national came to Tanauan to win the heart of a local lass. Since Tanauan is situated along the coast facing San Pedro Bay, the American national started making a skimboard which he eventually finished. However, he was not able to teach the local youths on how to use it since he already had to leave back to the States. He left the skimboard, and the local youths started to train themselves on how to use it. Thereafter, young people from Barangay San Roque and Barangay Santo Ni√±o started making prototypes of the skimboard which were then sold to enthusiasts. It has also been told, however, that the first skimboarder in the Philippines, Michael Miranda, together with his friend Kim Ian \\"Dodot\\" Monta√±o made the first locally-made skimboard, and with their enthusiasm for the sports introduced the skimboard and taught Tanauan locals how to ride it. The first skimboarding competition was organized by Darwin Maceda together with his friends Alexander Cumpio and Nerizza Reynera at Tanauan, Leyte's Bantay Dagat area on March 31, 2002. Since then, skimboarding started to spread to the nearby towns and later on throughout the country. Currently, national and international skimboarding competitions are held annually at the Bantay Dagat area in Tanauan.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is located south of Tacloban City. The cities closest to Tolosa are Tacloban, Ormoc, Baybay, Borongan, Catbalogan, and Maasin. The nearest municipalities are Tanauan, Tabontabon, Dulag, Palo, Julita, and Dagami. Its distance from the national capital is 588.52 kilometers (365.69 miles). Barangays Tolosa is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Climate History According to popular beliefs, Tolosa derived its name from a legend about three chieftains (datus) who united their chiefdoms. According to the legend, the area that is now Tolosa was ruled by three great datus: the datu of fishing, the datu of harvest and the datu of hunting. Typical of chiefdoms in those times, the three datus regard each other with hostility. One time a great battle broke out among the three of them. Their people fought valiantly in defense of each datu. But the three datus were strong they could not defeat each other. Accidentally they were hit by their own swords and they died. Their blood spilt everywhere. Then came a great earthquake followed by a tsunami. When the floodwaters subsided, three promontories rose on three sides of the three datus' lands, as if acting as defensive walls of the contiguous land. Survivors of the great battle realized that the three hills were their great datus who were now united in protecting them from outside dangers. From three (tolo) they became one (usa). Tolosa was once part of the nearby municipality of Tanauan. Magdaleno Vivero and Domingo Camacho petitioned the Spanish Government to grant Tolosa autonomy from Tanauan. The petition was approved in 1852, resulting in great jubilation among the new town's inhabitants. The town's residents, however, continued to call a nearby promontory Inapusong after the town's old name. Spanish officials named the town in honor of Tolosa, a town in the Basque Country, Spain. The town was formally founded in 1861 and became a parish on February 12, 1863. Its first parish priest was Padre Geronimo Asenjo, a Spaniard. The first Filipino priest of the parish was Father Quintin Bautista. In 1910, a plan to abolish the municipality worried its inhabitants. Owing to the efforts of Captain Daniel Romualdez, grandfather of the late Speaker Daniel Z. Romualdez, the plan to return Tolosa to the care of Tanauan was averted. During the liberation of the Philippines in 1944, Tolosa and its north eastern neighboring towns were spared from bombardment by the United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces when Eagle Scout Valeriano Abello of barangay San Roque, including two other identified scouts braved Japanese sniper fire and directed US and Filipino fire to the exact location of Japanese batteries along Leyte's north-eastern coast. Abello's act saved the lives of thousands of Leytenos and allowed the Filipino Soldiers and Allied Forces unhampered landing on the coast. This unhampered attack dealt the blow that broke the back of the Japanese resistance in Leyte, and ultimately The Philippines. A few days after the return of General Douglas MacArthur and the forces of liberation in Leyte, Tolosa became the base of the U.S Navy, as well as the 6th and 13th Air Force. It was in Tanghas, a barangay in Tolosa, where the famous American composer Irving Berlin first presented his renowned composition \\"Heaven Watch The Philippines\\" together with his Filipino audience including then President Sergio Osme√±a and Carlos P. Romulo. About 4 decades ago, Tolosa suffered its worst environmental disaster. The sand in the beaches of Tolosa were black until the 1970s because of the abundance of the mineral called magnetite, a naturally magnetized iron, which was a prime raw material for high quality steel. INCO (Iron, Nickel & Copper Ore), a mining company based in nearby barangay Opong, stripped the town's beaches of vegetation to get the mineral, destroying much of the wide beaches and rendering the town's coastal defenses bare against the onslaught of tidal erosion. Then First Lady Imelda Marcos developed the area between the sea and Mt. Inapusong and built a large compound where she entertained Miss Universe candidates during the pageant held in Manila.

History The municipality of Tunga existed as early as 1860 as a barrio of Barugo. At that time only about fifty families were residing there, most of them coming from the different towns of Barugo, Carigara and Jaro. There are different versions that have been told as to why the place was called Tunga. Due to their stronger credibility, only two of these legends have been selected as the possible ones. One states that according to our forefathers, before Tunga became a barrio, people from Ormoc, Carigara, Barugo, Jaro and Tacloban engaged in trade with each other and they had to stop by or pass this place. Some of them even made it their contact point for conducting their business. Through their exchange of ideas and conversations, they concluded that this place was halfway between Ormoc and Tacloban or Carigara and Jaro. Since it had no name at the time, people started calling it Tunga, the dialect for half. When it became a barrio, the residents, due to their familiarity with the name christened the place Tunga. On March 4, 1948, \\"Pag-urosa han mga Tunga-on\\", the association that led the campaign to make Tunga a municipality, was organized and it elected Domingo A. Ponferrada, President; Martino Ariza, 1st Vice President; Blas Uribe, 2nd Vice President; Vicente Catenza, 3rd Vice President; Primitivo Geraldo, Secretary; Norberto Quintana, treasurer; Ram√≥n Santillan Sr (died on October 13, 2005, at age 101) and Juan Avila, auditors; Paulo Cotoner, Magno Bu√±ales and Arsenio Carit, Sergeants-at-Arms. These officers invited and apprised Atilano R. Cinco, Congressman for the 5th District of Leyte, of the desire of Tunga to become an independent municipality. Cinco promised to file a bill in congress when all supporting papers that he had suggested were ready. Thus, a committee on consensus was created. Martino Ariza was elected as chairman; the members being some of the students of Tunga Institute. Subsequently, Philippine President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 266, dated September 24, 1949, creating the independent municipality of Tunga, however the appointed local officials had to assume their posts a few days after the elections. On November 15, 1949, Provincial Board Secretary Ricardo Collantes, representing Leyte Governor Catalino Landia, proclaimed the Municipality of Tunga before a huge crowd of joyous Tunga-on and distinguished visitors. The patron saint of Tunga is Saint Anthony of Padua. The Tunga-on celebrate their town's fiesta on August 13 every year. Geography = Barangays = Tunga is politically subdivided into 8 barangays: * Astorga (Barrio Upat) * Balire * Banawang * San Antonio (Poblacion) * San Pedro (Poblacion) * San Roque (Poblacion) * San Vicente (Poblacion) * Santo Ni√±o (Poblacion) =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Tunga, Leyte, was people, with a density of .  Economy  The socio-economic situation in Tunga can be described as poor with little outside investment and few opportunities for most of the municipality's citizens to improve their economic status. Income per capita is very low and the poverty incidence is alarming. The magnitude of families living below the poverty threshold is much too high. The under-employment rate is high and most people hold informal jobs and carry out various activities daily to earn barely a subsistence income for their families. The percent of households without their own dwellings is high. Elementary education participation is low, reflecting low incomes because families cannot afford to put their children through school and/or children are taken out of school to assist families with income-earning activities. As a result, the simple literacy rate is low. Crop production indicates very low land productivity with the majority of farmers involved in coconut tree cultivation for copra as their main economic mainstay. Rice cultivation is the second main agricultural activity. Some farmers also raise pigs and chickens to sell to the local meat shop in the local market. The fish catch, which is mainly Tilapia, in the Tunga River, which flows through the municipality, has decreased since 2005.

Biography  McWillie, born in Camden, South Carolina, was the son of the twenty-second Governor of Mississippi, William McWillie. He was educated at South Carolina College. Along with his father and his family, he moved to Madison County, Mississippi, in September 1845 and built \\"Kirkwood,\\" the family's home. In June 1846, McWillie raised a company from Madison County to volunteer for service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. More than 17,000 Mississippians volunteered, but only 1,000 were called to serve in the First Mississippi Regiment under Colonel Jefferson Davis. In order to serve, Captain McWillie enlisted in the Mississippi Rifles as a private and fought as part of force that took Monterey in September 1846. When the Second Mississippi Regiment was formed under Reuben Davis, McWillie took command of the Camden Rifles and served out remainder of war, fighting at the Battle of Buena Vista. Following the Mexican-American War, McWillie returned to Kirkwood, where he was a planter. In 1861 with the outbreak of the Civil War, he again raised the Camden Rifles, which became part of the 18th Mississippi Regiment under Col. E. R. Burt. The regiment arrived at Camp Walker, near Manassas, Virginia, on June 18, 1861, and, along with the 17th Mississippi and 5th South Carolina, was brigaded under Gen. David R. Jones. The brigade was on the extreme right of the Confederate army at Bull Run on July 21. Captain McWillie was killed by an enemy canister shot while rallying his command during an attack on the Union lines up Rocky Run. He was buried on the field alongside his nephew, Pvt. E.H. Anderson, who also was mortally wounded during the battle.

His professional career finished after a serious injury. Cricket career Contractor began his first-class career, playing for the Gujarat. The captain of Gujarat Phiroz Khambata saw how Nari played in the selection trial matches for MCA's Silver Jubilee matches in 1955. He did well in the trials and expected to be selected for the matches against Pakistan Services & Bhawalpur Cricket Association. He got to the team because Captain Kambatha had dropped out. Contractor scored hundreds in both innings of his debut, becoming the second man after Arthur Morris to do so. Later he was chosen to play for India. Nari became an opener after one of the players Vinoo Mankad couldn't take part in a Test match against New Zealand at Delhi in 1955. Later he became an Indian captain. At Lord's in 1959, he broke two ribs in the first innings by Brian Statham, despite which he scored 81. Later in the year, his 74 in the second innings at Kanpur was crucial in India winning its first Test against Australia. This innings ended when he pulled Alan Davidson, who was bowling left-arm spin at the time. Neil Harvey at short leg ducked and turned, but the ball got stuck between his legs. Injury and consequences Contractor led India to a series win against England in 1961‚Äì62 and captained the side to Caribbean the same season. After two Tests, Indian team traveled to Barbados. There, in a tour match against Barbados at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, in March 1962, he was on 2 not out while opening the batting with Dilip Sardesai during his side's first innings, when his attention was for a moment distracted as he faced Charlie Griffith in the fourth ball of the second over. He saw somebody open a window in the pavilion, and consequently was unable to concentrate on the ball following its delivery by Griffith, seeing the ball \\"just inches away before it hit\\" him. Contractor took a blow at the back of his skull fracturing it. A blood clot had developed inside his skull and pressing against the brain paralyzing him from the waist down. Two surgeries were performed to remove the clot. Requiring blood transfusion for the purpose, the West Indies captain Frank Worrell donated blood, alongside Contractor's teammates Chandu Borde, Bapu Nadkarni and Polly Umrigar. Contractor's life was saved but his international career was abruptly ended as a result. Mansoor Ali Khan of Pataudi took over the captaincy from the third test. In a recent interview, Contractor mentioned as his only regret that he wanted play just one Test after the injury, but people did not want him to. At the time Contractor was seriously injured, cricket batsmen did not wear helmets. They do now. During his playing days, Contractor was considered a glamour boy of Indian cricket. In an interview with Simi Garewal in 1999, former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa stated that as a schoolgirl she had a crush on Contractor. Present time Contractor now lives in Mumbai where he coaches at the Cricket Club of India Academy. He received the C.K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.C.K.

Aquinas, who had been canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, was proclaimed fifth Latin Doctor of the Church by Pius V in 1567. To honor this great doctor, in 1577 Juan Solano, former bishop of Cusco, Peru, generously funded the reorganization of the studium at the convent of the Minerva on the model of the College of St. Gregory at Valladolid in his native Spain.Carlo Longo, La formazione integrale domenicana al servizio della Chiesa e della societ√†, Edizioni Studio Domenicano, 1996, \\"J.

At the Minerva the College occupied several existing convent structures as well as new constructions. A detail from the Nolli Map of 1748 gives some idea of the disposition of buildings when the Minerva convent housed the College. The College cultivated the doctrines of St. Thomas Aquinas as a means of carrying out the Church's mission in the New World, where Solano had shown \\"much zeal in defending the rights of the Indians\\", and where Dominicans like Bartolom√© de las Casas, \\"Protector of the Indians\\", Pedro de Cordova, critic of the Encomienda system, and Francisco de Vitoria, theorist of international law, were already engaged.Cf.

The Angelicum Campus Trajan's Forum and Market with the Angelicum campus in distance at center including the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus. The Torre delle Milizie can be seen to the left of campus. The Angelicum campus is located in the historic center of Rome, Italy on the Quirinal hill in the section or rione of the eternal city known as Monti. It is situated near the beginning of via Nazionale just above the ruins of Trajan's Market, the via dei Fori Imperiali, and Piazza Venezia. =The site= The site of the Angelicum is recorded in history sometime before the year 1000 bearing the name Magnanapoli with a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nature of the site before the 9th century is uncertain. One theory holds that its name Magnanapoli derives from the expression Bannum Nea Polis or \\"fort of the new city\\" from the adjacent Byzantine military citadel which included the Torre delle Milizie Rome's oldest extant tower. =Architectonic features= In 1569 Dominican Pope Pius V ordered the construction of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus. This was followed in 1575 by a convent for Dominican nuns. Among the architects who worked on the complex are Vignola; Giacomo della Porta; Nicola and Orazio Torriani; and Vincenzo della Greca. The church's double staircase was added in 1654 by sculptor architect Orazio Torriani. In 1870 the religious community was expropriated by the Italian government. The Order was able to reacquire the complex in 1927 from the Italian government. After extensive renovation and additions the Angelicum and a convent of Dominican Friars was installed there. Today the University occupies approximately the entire ground level of the complex. The remaining portion, approximately the second and third levels around the cloister together with subterranean spaces, constitutes a convent for the community of Dominican Friars that serves the University. escutcheons of Pope Pius XI Accessed 8 September 2012 on the left and a Dominican shield bearing one of the Dominican mottos, \\"laudare, benedicere, praedicare\\" (to praise, to bless, to preach) on the right The main entrance of the Angelicum immediately to the right of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus was built into the existing structure in the early 1930s as part of the renovations undertaken to accommodate the Angelicum at its new site.

The two basins of the ancient fountain are fed by the Acqua Felice aqueduct, one of the aqueducts of Rome, and the first new aqueduct of early modern Rome, completed in 1585 by Pope Sixtus V whose birth name was Felice Peretti. It also feeds the fountain by Giovanni Battista Soria (c. 1630) at the entrance to the Angelicum's walled garden, and the fountain under the stair below the University's portineria or porter's lodge before coursing across the Quirinal hill to its terminus at the Moses fountain or Fontana dell'Acqua Felice on the Via del Quirinale.N. Cardano, \\"La mostra dell'Acqua Felice\\", in Il Trionfo dell'acqua (Rome, 1986:250-54) Arched porticos designed by Vignola but completed after his death flank the cloister. Ten arches on the long sides and seven on the short are sustained by pilasters in the Tuscan style rising from high plinths. A simple frieze with smooth triglyphs and metopes separates lower from upper levels. Cloister of the Angelicum Eleven classrooms encircle the cloister, the last of which, the Aula della Sapienza (Hall of Wisdom) is the site of the University's doctoral defenses. Also located off the cloister are the administration offices and the Sala delle Colonne, a reception room with antique marble columns and arched ceilings bearing traces of late Renaissance style frescos, which initially housed a library. On the second level encircling the cloister are the living quarters of Dominican professors and the Sala del Senato (Academic Senate Room). The latter was the Chapter room of the convent and is appointed with a 14th-century triptych of Saint Andrew by Lippo Vanni, a 13th-century crucifix, and a full-body relic of an unidentified saint encased in Imperial Roman armor.Pro Unione, 16 October 2010: \\"In what had been the chapter room, and serves now as the Sala de Senato, the full-body relic of an unnamed saint rests in the armor of an imperial roman soldier under the altar, unbeknownst to even some of the faculty\\" http://prounione.wordpress.com/tag/angelicum/page/2/ Accessed 20 August 2012 =The Angelicum auditoria= To the east of the Sala delle Colonne is the Aula Magna Giovanni Paolo II, a raked semicircular auditorium with seating for 1100 people that was constructed during 1930s renovations by Roman engineer Vincenzo Passarelli (1904‚Äì1985).Enciclopedia Treccani http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-passarelli The Aula Magna was recently renamed after one of the Angelicum's most illustrious alumni, Pope John Paul II. The adjacent Aula Minor San Raimondo seats 350 people. Beyond these auditoria are the university's cafe, the Angelicum Bookshop, and the university's library. =The Angelicum administration building= The Palazzo dei Decanati (Deans' Building) is located at the West edge of campus just inside the main gates. The West boundary of the Angelicum is formed by the Salita del Grillo. =The Angelicum library= The main part of the Angelicum library consists of that part of the textual patrimony of the Angelicum not expropriated by the Italian government with the Biblioteca Casanatense in 1870. At the convent of Saints Sixtus and Dominic the library originally housed 40,000 volumes in the Sala delle Colonne. As the library grew space was found under the Aula Magna for a library whose large windows face out to the palm trees of the Angelicum walled garden. The collection that remains at the college today consists of approximately 400 000 volumes, about 6 000 manuscripts, 2 200 incunabula including 64 Greek codices, and 230 Hebrew texts including 5 Samaritan codices is open to the scholarly community. Among the library's treasures is included the original copy of the doctoral thesis Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross) written by the future Pope John Paul II, Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça, under the direction of Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange and defended on 19 June 1948Accessed 6 October 2012. =The Angelicum garden= On the south side of campus the walled garden is bordered by private properties. At the garden entrance stands a fountain by Giovanni Battista Soria built circa 1630. The garden is planted with trees of many kinds: orange, lemon, pistachio, olive, fig, palm and laurel, as well as with grape vines, and is an oasis of calm and silence, a figure of paradise in the midst of the bustling eternal city. In 1946 in this garden the young student Karol Wojtyla, future Pope John Paul II, would stroll and visit daily what he called the \\"miraculous tree\\", an ancient olive from which springs incredibly the branches of a palm, a fig, and a laurel. =The University Church, Chapel, and Choir= Along the north side of campus are found the University's Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, and the Choir. The church has been the subject of numerous works of art. In the 18th century Antonio Canaletto made a pen and ink study with grey wash and black chalk, today in the collection of the British Museum, described as depicting \\"the Church of SS Domenico e Sisto, Rome; with a sweeping double staircase to the entrance, in the foreground a man bowing to two approaching ladies\\".

In addition, for the Doctorate degree a four corned biretta is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned biretta is to be worn. Traditionally the ceremony at which the biretum is imposed is called the \\"birretatio\\". For those holding doctoral degrees from a pontifical university or faculty \\"the principal mark of a Doctor's dignity is the four horned biretta.\\"John Abel Nainfa, Costume of Prelates of The Catholic Church: According To Roman Etiquette, 164. The 1917 Code of Canon Law canon 1378 and 1922 commentary prescribe the four corned biretum doctorale and doctoral ring or annulum doctorale for doctorates in philosophy, theology, canon law, specifying that the biretum should decorated according to the color of the faculty (\\"diverso colore ornatum pro Facultate\\").See Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici, 1922, Liber III, Pars IV, Tit. XXII, which clarifies that the biretum should be decorated according to the color of the faculty: Comment 262. Doctoratus ac Scentiae effectus canonici sic recensentur can. 1378: \\"doctoribus seu gradum academicum in una ex quatuor supradictis facultatibus supremum obtinentibus, rite creatis, seu promotis regulariter post examen, iuxta ¬´ statuta a Sede Apostolica probata ¬ª (can. 1376, ¬ß 2) saltem quoad usum validum ¬´ facultatis ab eadem Aplca.

The 'traditional' Angelicum biretta is white to correspond to the white Dominican habit. However, the Academic Senate of the Angelicum in its May 2011 meeting indicated that for the Licentiate and Doctorate a black biretta may be used with colored piping and pom to follow the color of the faculty. The biretta is lay in origin and was adopted by the Church in the 14th century: \\"Many synods ordered the use of this cap [the pileus or skull cap] as a substitute for the hood, and in one instance the synod of Bergamo, 1311, ordered the clergy to wear the bireta on their heads after the manner of laymen'.\\" Herbert Norris, Church Vestments: Their Origin and Development, 1950, 161). =Angelicum athletics= The Olympic motto Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was coined by Henri Didon for a Paris youth gathering in 1891, and later proposed as the official Olympic motto by his friend Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and made official in 1924. Didon completed his theological studies at the College of Saint Thomas in 1862.; \\"Sport athl√©tique\\", 14 mars 1891: \\"[...] dans une √©loquente allocution il a souhait√© que ce drapeau les conduise 'souvent √† la victoire, √† la lutte toujours'. Il a dit qu'il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d'√™tre des sports athl√©tiques: citius, altius, fortius, 'plus vite, plus haut, plus fort'.\\", cited in Hoffmane, Simone La carri√®re du p√®re Didon, Dominicain. 1840 - 1900, Doctoral thesis, Universit√© de Paris IV - Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, Les fondements p√©dagogiques de la devise olympique ‚Äûcitius, altius, fortius‚Äú The Clericus Cup is a soccer tournament that takes place annually between the various pontifical universities of Rome. The teams are composed of seminarians, priests, and lay students studying in each of the pontifical universities. The league was started by Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone who is an unapologetic football fan. The Angelicum first participated in 2011, and came in 2nd place in 2012. During the history of the Clericus Cup, players have come from 65 countries, with the majority coming from Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and the United States. The annual tournament is organized by the Centro Sportivo Italiano. Officially, the goal of the league is to \\"reinvigorate the tradition of sport in the Christian community.\\" In other words, to provide a venue for friendly athletic competition among the thousands of seminarians and lay students, representing nearly a hundred countries, who study in Rome. In November 2011 Minerva the Owl was voted in as the Angelicum mascot. =Student housing= The Angelicum does not provide housing primarily intended for lay students. However, assistance finding local student housing is offered by the Angelicum Office of Student Affairs (ASPUST).Angelicum Office of Student Affairs The office is located in the Palazzo dei Decanati or Deans' Building at the West end of campus, just inside the gates to the right. The Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas is an international college for lay students within walking distance of the Angelicum. The Convitto San Tommaso was established by the Dominican Order in 1963 as a place of residence in Rome for secular priests who come to the Rome in order to pursue higher studies at one or other of the Roman Universities. There are approximately 55 student priests. They come from five continents of the world. Three Dominicans live in the house to serve the practical and spiritual needs of the house: the Rector, the Spiritual Director, and the Bursar. The life of the house focuses on daily celebration of the Eucharist. =Student activities= The following is a sample of student activities: *The Associazione Studentesca Pontificia Universit√† San Tommaso (ASPUST), or Student Association of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas, is housed in the Angelicum Office of Student Affairs.Accessed 14 April 2013 ASPUST holds elections for its offers in mid November each year. ASPUST offers services to students and prospective students of the Angelicum such as information about health services and insurance, information about apartment hunting, other services relating to public transportation, computers, cafeterias, and a blog that reports on student activities. *At various times during the academic year one of the Faculties or the Student Association sponsors a day-long pilgrimage for students and faculty to locales such as Assisi, Norcia, Cascia, Subiaco, Orvieto, Siena, or Roccasecca, birthplace of St. Thomas Aquinas. *Chaplaincy of the Angelicum sponsors a \\"Karol Wojtyla Discussion Group\\" that meets weekly. *The Angelicum Choir meets for practice each week in the Chapel. =Bookstore= The Angelicum Bookshop is run by Libreria Leoniana of Rome. Located on near the University Library, it specializes in ecclesiastical literature, Italian and foreign language literature, and provides stationery, photo-reproduction, computer, and bindery services. Hours during the academic year are 9:00am to 1:00pm and 3:00pm to 6:00pm. It is closed Saturdays and the month of August. Publications and media *Angelicum is the official peer-reviewed academic journal of the university. The journal covers the major disciplines of the university, including theology, philosophy, canon law, and social science, as well as other sacred disciplines. It was established in 1924 as Unio Thomistica and obtained its current title in 1925. Articles are published in English, Italian, Spanish, French, and German. *Oikonomia is the journal founded in 1999 at the Faculty of Social Sciences (FASS) of the Angelicum. It is a collaborative project of the lecturers and students of the faculty, and of scholars who work with the FASS. The issues that are covered are those of the social sciences, as we understand them in our tradition, covering five areas: philosophy, law, history, psico-sociological, economics. The subjects treated as the journal's editorial profile has developed have ranged from theoretical issues to reports on conferences, to reviews of important new books. Particular attention is given in every number to selecting a text from the recent or distant past, but which always has particular significance for the main theme of the number; this text, the \\"classic page\\", is always directly connected with the editorial. The editorial committee ensures only that a correct methodology has been employed by the author of contributions. It does not vet the content of the articles, for which the sole responsibility lies with the authors. *Studi is a series of monographs produced by the Istituto San Tommaso treating Thomistic themes including historical and contemporary hermeneutics of St. Thomas. A recent contribution to his series is the volume Sanctitatis causae - Motivi di santit√† e cause di canonizzazione di alcuni maestri medievali, eds Margherita Maria Rossi e Teodora Rossi. *Angelicum University Press (AUP) was founded in 2002 to oversee the publication projects of the Angelicum. *The Angelicum sponsors the \\"Angelicum University Channel,\\" an online video channel that features news coverage of major Angelicum events and initiatives. *The Angelicum Office of Public Relations sponsors the \\"Angelicum Newsletter Blog\\" and the \\"Angelicum Alumni Website\\".

After Umar Tall's 1864 death, his nephew Tidiani Tall succeeded him as head of the Toucouleur Empire. Ahmadu Seku continued to act as Faama of the eastern regions from Segou, suppressing the rebellions of several neighboring cities but quarrelling increasingly with his brothers.

The term is also used not as a measure of rate, but simply to refer to the stream of offers or opportunities as a collective whole. An organization's deal flow is considered \\"good\\" if it results in enough revenue- or equity-generating opportunities to keep the organization functioning at peak capacity. For private consultants to HNWIs & UHNWIs, deal flow is called Deal Generation, which is the process of making deals with a business as the result of lead generation. In venture capital The most famous and successful venture capital firms regularly receive hundreds of business plans each month. From among these, it is not unusual for a VC firm to actually fund only 0.25%‚Äì0.5%. Active angel investment groups will typically receive dozens of plans monthly, but because of the much smaller number of plans compared to VCs they tend to fund a somewhat higher percentage (0.5%‚Äì1.0%). Once a company makes it through the group's screening process, however and is invited to present to the group's full membership, its chances of getting funded rise to about 18%, according to the University of New Hampshire's Center for Venture Research. Sources of deal flow A fund's or group's deal flow is generated from many sources. The most valuable referrals often come from entrepreneurs or companies in which the fund has previously invested; from other funds looking to syndicate a deal; and from professionals (such as attorneys and accountants) who are familiar with the fund's investment criteria. Other sources of deal flow are investment bankers and \\"finders\\", who expect to receive a fee (from either the company or the investor) for making the introduction. Many funds and groups (but not all) will also accept business plans \\"over the transom\\", that is, as an unreferred submission from a company with no previous relationship with the funding organization. In practice, however, such unreferred plans are usually much less likely to receive funding. In order to create and maintain a sufficient deal flow, venture capitalists and angels spend much of their time doing business development, raising their profiles by giving speeches, writing blogs, and networking with others who also work with early-stage companies. VCs and angels also regularly attend conferences and \\"venture fairs\\" where multiple companies pitch their businesses to investors. Impact of the JOBS Act on deal flow Deal flow on the Internet is currently undergoing a fundamental transformation due to the JOBS Acts passage in the United States. Soon, equity based deals and funds will be able to be marketed to the public through equity crowdfunding. This is normally referred to as general solicitation. General solicitation of these equity deals will increase the deal flow on the Internet.

It is adjacent to the South London railway originating at , and a quarter of a mile from the Old Den, which it replaced in 1993. Built on a previous site of housing, a church and the Senegal Fields playgrounds, it has an all-seated capacity of 20,146, although that is restricted to approximately 18,100 to allow for visiting fans segregation and crowd safety measures. The highest match attendance in the 2018-19 season was 17,195. The Den is the sixth stadium that Millwall have occupied since their formation in the Millwall area of the Isle of Dogs in 1885. Previous grounds include Glengall Road (1885‚Äì1886), Lord Nelson Ground (1886‚Äì1890), The Athletic Grounds (1890‚Äì1901), North Greenwich (1901‚Äì1910) and The Old Den (1910‚Äì1993). History The New Den, as it was initially known to distinguish it from its predecessor, was the first new all-seater stadium in England to be completed after the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (particularly given Millwall's crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Old Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced in 1990 that the club would relocate to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area in south Bermondsey. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000, however, the club opted to wait so the capacity was kept to just over 20,000.Moving On: The New Den South London rivals Millwall and Charlton playing in front of the Cold Blow Lane Stand at The Den in December, 2016. Millwall played their final game at The Old Den on 8 May 1993 after 83 years and then moved to the new stadium a quarter-of-a-mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The ¬£16 million New Den was opened by John Smith, the leader of the Labour Party and of the Opposition at the time, on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against Sporting Portugal, which Sporting won 2‚Äì1. The Den was the first new stadium constructed for a professional football team in London since 1937. Millwall have experienced mixed fortunes since relocating to The Den. Their first season at the stadium (1993‚Äì94) saw them finish third in Division One ‚Äî their highest finish since relegation from the top flight four years earlier. However, their dreams of Premier League football were ended by a defeat in the playoffs and they were relegated to Division Two in 1996, not winning promotion from that level until 2001. They again came close to reaching the Premier League in 2002, finishing fourth, but once again losing in the playoffs. The Lions reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 2004, and despite a 3‚Äì0 defeat by Manchester United they qualified for European competition for the first time in their history. Millwall has been relegated twice since then; going down in 2006 and 2015, but have also won promotion in 2010 and 2017. However, the stadium has yet to host Premier League football - Millwall had played in the old First Division for two seasons from 1988 during their final few years at their previous stadium. In September 2016 Lewisham Council approved a compulsory purchase order of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, as part of a major redevelopment of the \\"New Bermondsey\\" area. The plans are controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by offshore companies with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park and the highly acclaimed and well recognised Millwall Community Trust - to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no council housing and less than 15% of 'affordable housing'. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the football club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal's plans. In December 2016 Private Eye reported how Renewal had been founded by a former Lewisham Council leader and senior officer, suggesting potential bias, and that the decision to approve Renewal's plans may have been made as long ago as 2013 despite the fact that no due diligence had been able to be carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers due to \\"poor\\" and \\"limited\\" access to information and management at Renewal, which is registered in the Isle of Man. In October 2019 Lewisham Council terminated the conditional land sale agreement with Renewal. This allowed Millwall to prepare their own development plans, and in February 2020, Millwall announced plans for a phased expansion, adding upper tiers behind existing seating to gradually expand the Den to 34,000 seats. Stands On 20 January 2011 the east stand of The Den was renamed as the Dockers Stand, paying tribute to Millwall's earlier history and supporter-base of Thames dockers.The Dockers stand The south stand is known as the Cold Blow Lane stand, which was the name of the road which led into The Old Den. The north stand is for visiting supporters and the west stand was renamed the Barry Kitchener Stand, named after Millwall's longest-serving player. It houses Millwall's family enclosure, press box and executive seats.

Madhubani art (or Mithila painting) is a style of Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. This painting is done with a variety of tools, including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.  Origins Madhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term \\"Madhubani art\\" being used alongside \\"Mithila Painting.\\"Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, \\"Documenting the Image in Mithila Art,\\" Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5-33 The paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status. Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively. Madhubani paintings mostly depict people and their association with nature and scenes and deities from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs. Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women. It is still practiced and kept alive in institutions spread across the Mithila region.

In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik styles were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses paintings. People of lower castes included aspects of their daily life and symbols, the story of Raja Shailesh [guard of the village] and much more, in their paintings. Nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form, so there is no difference in the work on the basis of the caste system. They work in all five styles. Madhubani art has received worldwide attention.  Contributions  The Madhubani painting tradition played a key role in the conservation efforts in India in 2012, where there was frequent deforestation in the state of Bihar. Shashthi Nath Jha, who runs the Gram Vikas Parishad, an NGO, started the initiative as an attempt to protect local trees that were being cut down in the name of expanding roads and development. The main reason behind this was that the trees were traditionally adorned with forms of gods and other religious and spiritual images such as those of Radha-Krishna, Rama-Sita, scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata and other mythologies.  Artists and awards  Madhubani painting received official recognition in 1969 when Sita Devi received the State award by Government of Bihar. Jagdamba Devi was the first artist from Mithila to receive a National Award in Mithila paintings. In 1975, the President of India gave the Padma Shri award to Jagdamba Devi, and the National Award to Sita Devi of Jitwarpur village near Madhubani. Jagdamba Devi's foster son Satya Narayan Lal Karn and his wife Moti Karn are also well- regarded Mithila artists, and they won the National Award jointly in 2003. Sita Devi received the Padma Shri in 1981. Sita Devi was also awarded by Bihar Ratna in 1984 and Shilp Guru in 2006. In 1984 Ganga Devi was awarded by Padma Shri. Mahasundari Devi received the Padma Shri in 2011. Baua Devi, Yamuna Devi, Shanti Devi, Chano Devi, Bindeshwari Devi, Chandrakala Devi, Shashi kala Devi, Leela Devi, Godavari Dutta, and Bharti Dayal were also given the National award. Chandrabhushan (Rasidpur), Ambika Devi (Rasidpur), Manisha jha were also given the National award.

According to the , it has a population of people, making it as the most sparsely populated city in the Philippines. Palayan was created on June 19, 1965 by the Congress of the Philippines and is one of seven planned cities in the Philippines (the other six being Manila, Baguio, Quezon City, Trece Martires, Koronadal and the Island Garden City of Samal). The new provincial capitol, convention center, and sports center of Nueva Ecija are located in the city. History On March 25, 1952, a special consultation meeting was conducted by Governor Leopoldo Diaz along with Congressman Jesus Ilagan, Board Members Dioscoro de Leon and Antonio Corpuz, Don Felipe Buencamino, and the municipal mayors of Nueva Ecija to discuss the transfer the provincial capital from Cabanatuan. As a result, the group unanimously agreed to establish the new capital on the site of the Government Stock Farm located within the municipalities of Laur and Bongabon. The municipalities of Gapan, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Guimba, Talavera, General Tinio, Baloc (Santo Domingo), and Mu√±oz were also considered as potential sites for the new capital. In 1955, President Ramon Magsaysay declared a portion of the Government Stock Farm open for settlement pursuant to presidential Proclamation No. 237. On June 19, 1965, the Congress of the Philippines enacted Republic Act 4475 creating Palayan City as the new capital of Nueva Ecija. \\"Palayan\\" (rice paddy) was chosen as the name of the new provincial capital to reflect the moniker bestowed upon the province of Nueva Ecija as the ‚ÄúRice Granary of the Philippines‚Äù. The city government was constituted on December 5, 1965 with then Governor Eduardo L. Joson acting as the city's Ex-Officio Mayor while the Provincial Board constituted the first City Council. Under this administration, Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) purchased a large tract of land at the city's parameters near Laur to house INC members from Hacienda Luisita due to conflicts arising from union disbandments. In 1969, Mayor Elpidio O. Cucio and Vice-Mayor Felipe Bautista, both formerly appointed to their respective offices, were amongst the first elected local officials of the city along with councilors Flor Agustin, Tranquilino dela Cruz, Antonio Pascual, Federico Dacanay, Luis Lacalle and Thomas Lumawig. The city also hosted the National Boy Scout Jamboree attended by thousands of local and foreign scouts during this year. In August 1969, the city was enlarged by virtue of Republic Act 6052 authored by then Congressman Angel Concepcion which provided for the inclusion of the Military Reservation in Laur and the Fort Magsaysay Cantonment area located in Santa Rosa. In 1972, by virtue of Proclamation No. 893, a portion of the Government Stock Farm was allocated for the displaced population of Pantabangan due to the construction of the Pantabangan Dam. The resettlement site was eventually converted into barangay Marcos Village. In 1983, the training ground of the Philippine Army was transferred from Fort Bonifacio in Metro Manila to Fort Ramon Magsaysay. This paved the way for the development of the reservation area into a training complex to serve the army's training requirements. In 1993, the Asianwide Green Scouts Movement was founded during the first RP-Japan Bilatateral Ecology Work Camp held in the city. The event also led to the establishment of the projects Kawayang Buhay and the Asian Ecology Forest which is supported by the Asian Friendship Society. On 1995, Barangay Popolon, formerly a barangay of Bongabon, was annexed to the city by virtue of Republic Act No. 8030 ratified by a plebiscite held on October 1, 1995. Moreover, Bagong Buhay, one of the three resettlement areas in the city, was converted to a regular barangay after a plebiscite on November 26, 1995. The new provincial capitol building of Nueva Ecija was completed in 2002, solidifying the city's status as both the de facto and de jure capital of the province.

History =Early Beginnings= Pangasinenses from Paniqui, Tarlac who used to pasture their cattle, foresters from Santa Maria, Narvacan, Ilocos Sur; Paoay and Batac in Ilocos Norte; and Pangasinenses from Calasiao and San Carlos, Pangasinan, settled in great number in the town. It is said that the exodus, particularly from Ilocos Sur, was due to the forced labor enforced by the Spaniards in the construction of the Catholic Church in Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur. Cuyapo was declared a Barrio of Rosales on September 25, 1849, with Senior Santiago Vergara as its first Teniente del Barrio. Rosales was then a part of Nueva Ecija. It was in 1901 during the American Civil Commission that Rosales, together with Balungao, Umingan, San Quintin, were segregated from Nueva Ecija and became parts of Pangasinan. =Creation of the Town= On October 29, 1859, Cuyapo was separated from Rosales, Pangasinan and made a full-fledged town with Don Juan Pangalilingan as the first Gobernadorcillo. It was during his term that the first Catholic Church and convent was constructed. The old road to Guimba, passing through what is now Barangay Maycaban was constructed. On October 29, 1959, Cuyapo celebrated the centennial of its creation as a town. =The Revolutionary Period= On July 1, 1898, Gen. Mariano Llanera, then Military Governor of Nueva Ecija, appointed Don Marcelo Garcia, last Capitan Municipal during the Spanish Regime, as Presidente Municipal with Don Mariano Flores, last Teniente Mayor, as Vise Presidente Municipal. Later, under the supervisonal government, election of municipal officials was held. This revolutionary period of government existed until the American forces came in November 1898. It was during this period when the people showed their patriotism and loyalty to the cause of the revolution. On June 19, 1898, two to three hundred Cuyapenos, under Teniente Isabelo del Valle of Paniqui, Tarlac, answered the call of duty and ambushed a heavily armed contingent of Spanish Cazadores who came from Rosales en route to Tarlac in Bessang (now part of Barangay Maycaban. The Cuyapenos then had only fifteen (15) Remington rifles and the rest armed with bolos. Barangays Cuyapo is politically subdivided into 51 barangays.

According to the , it has a population of people. It was incorporated by the King of Spain by virtue of a royal decree in 1897. Etymology Guimba came from the Ilocano term 'Gebba' which was the process of heating molded clay pots in a pit until they turn reddish and durable. Tree stumps were made into large pieces of charcoal. The live charcoals were placed underneath the clay pots. After a few hours these were hardened and ready to bring out from the pit and ready for use. The story goes, once a Spanish visited the place where most of the residents are engaged in pottery making. The foreigner stopped and asked the earth-bakers this question in a nasalized manner, 'Que lugar este?'. The foreigner asked what this place was. The natives misunderstood the question and were asked what they were doing, so they answered ‚ÄúGEBBA‚Äù pointing to the ground. The Spaniard repeated the word as they left the place ‚ÄúGHEBHA‚Äù after years have gone by the name of the place was hispanized into Guimba when the Spaniard founded the town as Pueblo en la provincia de Nueva Ecija. This pottery-making tradition is prevalent even in other barangays outside the central area of the town. An example is Barangay Pasong Intsik, which was named after 'old jars containing Chinese remains' were once found beneath a bridge. The early Ilocano settlers brought with them the wonder image of Apo San Juan so they called the place San Juan de Guimba. In the American period, a resolution on the town separated the term 'Guimba' from 'Apo San Juan', thus its present name. But Apo San Juan remains as its Patron Saint. The pottery traditions of the indigenous settlers were later disintegrated and lost due to population influx from the Ilocos region and other areas in the south. History What is now the town of Guimba was once a vast ecological rainforest which was part of the Central Luzon Rainforest during precolonial time, before the arrival of the Spanish. The area is believed to be inhabited by no permanent communities, rather, it is inhabited by hunter-gatherer societies, mainly Ilonggots. The area was once part of the huge territory that the Empire of Tondo, with its capital in a much forested Manila. In the collapse of the Empire of Tondo after the subjugation of Brunei, the area was transitioned into a free zone once again, where hunter-gatherers abounded. The area is also believed to once have been visited by migrating Aetas, Cordillerans, Ilokanos, and Ilonggots. The first Ilocano settlers, arriving in wooden carts and horsebacks, cleared the thick forests and planted the first rice seeds on February 20, 1865, according to an old and brownish record found by Guimba's former Parish priest, Rev. Agustin \\"Gus\\" Polong, MSC. They called the area 'San Juan de Guimba' in honor of the patron saint the settlers brought from Ilocos, San Juan, and combined it with the pot-making industry called 'gebba' which they used to do in the old land. Since then, rice became the primary agricultural crop in the area. Due to this, it became the province of Nueva Ecija's traditional top rice-producing area in the 20th century. More settlers arrived mostly from the old towns of Bacarra, Paoay, and Candon of the Ilocos provinces. Among the families who came were the Galapons, Mateos, Cudals, Padres, Cayogs, Romanos, Silvestres, Capinpuyans, Batangans, Faigals, Ramoses, Sumawangs, and Catabonas. What would be the town of Guimba is a relatively organized community when the Spanish colonialists arrived and appointed Don Luis De Ocampo as the first Gobernadorcillo, and later, Don Pablo Ramos and Santiago Cudal. The Spanish left and the Americans came and in 1912, the town's name was abbreviated to Guimba with Don Alfonso Faigal as the first Alcalde Mayor. St. John the Evangelist though remains to be its patron saint. The first municipal hall was also built during this year in what is now known as Faigal Street. The Plaza Municipal evolved and what will become the public market started its commerce. A foot bridge was constructed during the administration of the late Agustin Vigilia, Alcalde Mayor. This foot bridge was constructed across the Binituran River leading to the northern barrios like San Andres, Balbalino, Gueset, Baybayabas, Cinence, Nangabulan to barangay Talugtug from the Parairo Street. Later this wooden bridge was demolished and transferred it to the present site north of the Faigal St. This was known as Faigal Bridge going to the north, to the municipality of Talugtug. Other infrastructures were put up with the public market and cleared the space for the Municipal Plaza, now the midtown municipal park. In 1941, during the Japanese regime the late Juan Villamar was appointed Municipal Mayor. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese military forces entered and occupied Guimba in 1942. At daybreak of January 26, to August 15, 1945, advance reconnaissance units of the American troops under the U.S. Army 6th Infantry Division and aided by the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 22nd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division liberated Guimba and, within hours, established outposts nine miles farther to the east along the Licab River and La Paz. Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces liberated the town of Guimba in 1945 and ended World War II. In 1963, Dr. Virgilio Calica was the Mayor and it was during his term that the old Municipal Hall was constructed, the present site of our new municipal hall constructed in year 2004. This building was demolished during the administration of Jose Bopet Dizon and the new Municipal Hall was constructed and occupied in 2006. In 2006, Guimba became a first class municipality.

According to the , it has a population of people. History During the Spanish Era, the municipality was only a component barrio of Gapan. When San Isidro became a town and was separated from Gapan, the town and San Antonio became one of its component barrios. When San Antonio itself became a town, the area was still its component barrio called San Agustin. By 1865, Jaen was known by its old name \\"Ibayong Ilog\\", and because there were many people in the river port in what is now Barangay Langla, the town became a centre for trade. When the place improved and its population grew to no less than 5,000 people, it became a town through a petition filed by the inhabitants through the initiative of two early leaders, Kabesang Prudencio Esquivel and Kapitan Antonio Embuscado. On June 18, 1865, Jaen itself partitioned from San Antonio, and retained Saint Augustine of Hippo as its patron saint. The Spanish officials signed the papers granting the petition that \\"Ibayong Ilog\\" be a town in Factoria (now San Isidro) which was then the capital of Nueva Ecija. The declaration was brought to Governor-General Juan de Lara e Irigoyen in Manila, and afterwards was submitted to the Vice-General of the Philippines in the person of Rev Gregorio Mart√≠nez. Father Mart√≠nez marked the document as approved but later wrote in his own wish that the name \\"Ibayong Ilog\\" be changed to the name of his birthplace of Ja√©n, Spain. In coordination with Rev Estanislao B. Moso, Kabesang Prudencio and Kapitan Antonio led the establishment of the first Catholic church (the present-day parish church). Jaen is in Central Luzon, in the southern part of Nueva Ecija. About 100 km from Manila via the old Cagayan Valley Road, the town has other road networks connecting it to Nueva Viscaya, Isabela, Pampanga, Olangapo and Bataan. In the olden days, Pampanga River was once the only and the fastest way of transportation in going to Manila and other places. On August 24, 1896, its people revolted against the Spaniards and in September of the same year, armed with bolos and spears, ambushed and killed forty Spanish soldiers in Lumanas (now a Sitio of Barangay Santo Tomas South). This successful attack made Lumanas a historical site called \\"Pinagtambangan\\", where a marker was erected in memory of the event. On August 8, 2010, Mirex Sebastian established the online news site Zeibiz, which is based in Jaen, Nueva Ecija. Geography The municipality is situated in the southern part of Nueva Ecija, some north of Manila.

Twenty barangays of Ja√©n are fully irrigated, with about 80% of the land (approximately 9,500 hectares) being suited for rice production. Mango plantations are found in the southern portion of the municipality. Based on the latest survey, 584 hectares are utilized for mango production, including backyard mango farms. Ten percent of the total agricultural area is for planting vegetables. In the Poblaci√≥n and nearby barangays, several establishments have sprouted. These include agricultural supply traders, dry goods stores, hardware stores, groceries, travel agency, fashion style, pawnshop, banks, supermarkets, gasoline stations, printing presses, and eateries. The public market is in the area. Among the service businesses in the area are pawn shops, restaurants, auto and motorcycle parts and service, car wash, commercial center, lechon manok and liempo stand, pharmacies, computer repair shops, convenience store, bakery, petrol station, grocery, internet caf√©, tailoring and dress shops and rural banks. Distilled and purified water processors, mobile phone card dealers, cable and landline telephone businesses are also present in the municipality. Professional services of doctors, accountants, dentists, lawyers, surveyors and engineers are also prevalent in the town. Most of the unemployed and out- of-school youths are given manual labor by private contractors and the local government unit, such as construction workers and street sweepers.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Licab was formerly a part of another town, Aliaga. In 1835, immigrants Don Dalmacio Esguerra and brother Tomas, toiled to scrape off thick leaves using only hoes and twigs of hard trees. The Esguerra Brothers first called the place ‚ÄúPulong‚ÄîSamat‚Äù. Later, after years of successful tilling and with families growing bigger they renamed the place Licab, an Ilocano word meaning to \\"scrape off\\". Don Dalmacio had three other brothers who assisted him in his endeavour: Pedro, Abdun and Olegario. Olegario Esguerra married a woman named Betis, and one of their children is named Juliana who, in the early 1890s, married another local Gregorio Espiritu. The new settlement attracted more settlers. Don Dalmacio's commitment to improve Licab inspired him to work for its political identity. He filed a petition to the national government to make Licab a formal town. At first, the friar governor of Aliaga opposed the petition but later relented and Licab was proclaimed an independent municipality on March 28, 1894. From the town archives of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, Ilocano families of Barangan, Bumanlag, Dawang and Casino all relatives immigrated to Licab a former barrio of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija in the early 1900s. Some relatives went as far as Guimba, Santo Domingo, Munoz, San Jose City and some had gone as far as San Mateo Nueva Viscaya to reside and raised their own families. The group led by Igmidio Barangan and his son Santiago Barangan and grandsons Dr.Victor A. Barangan and Dr. Roman A Barangan who became the town's earliest professionals in the fields of Medicine and Dentistry respectively, served in the town's Health Care System privately supplanting the early Albularios. A number of close relatives along with five sisters populated the town. The sisters were married to the families of Dumaya, Fernando, Juan, Bumanlag and Sawit and close relatives that were descendants of Tabios, Mariano, Agustin, Manuel and Corpuz among others. All of them remained residents of Licab and raised generations of families that now composed the majority of the populations. Following the establishment of Taft Commission on June 11, 1901 after the end of Philippine - American War, Gov General Wesley Merrit introduced Homesteading to clear the land and populate the province. Like the American old west the colonial government offering Homesteading to the new settlers is something new and this resulted in the mass exodus of Ilocano farmers. These families including the new settlers at nearby towns were generations of farmers and farmhands that sought freedom to own lands in the vast agricultural plains of Central Luzon. A well known national figure, Epifanio Delos Santos was elected the first Governor of Nueva Ecija in 1902 and 1904 under the American regime. Don Panyong as he was known to the town's folks was a well knowned Historian, Fiscal and a Writer, that made a name for himself in the national political arena. Hi-way 54 which was known to the Americans was named Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) in his honor in 1959 by virtue of Republic Act 2140. A member of his family who left the town after the end of World War 2 went to reside in Malabon and donated a family lot that now became the town's Public Market at Poblacion Sur. Some well known old places may no longer be known today to young generations but as far as the history of Licab is concerned, these were part of development of the town. As a manifestation of these family's ownership, a place in a low-lying areas of the town called \\"kababaan\\" was named Sitio Barangan which is now part of Barangay Aquino along with Sitio Parsons, Suva and Ablang. In the early 19th century the head of the clan Igmidio a widower, lost his life for the love of a barrio lass of \\"Bangbangkag\\" now called Barangay San Cristobal. His son Santiago did not permit his marriage and therefore in a tree with a piece of rope ended his life in a tragedy. The place is now called \\"Pinagbitinan\\" at nearby local Church of Rizal. In a year, the town proper were many times under water that includes some rice fields mostly destroyed. Some streets were inundated by stagnant water with makeshift pedestrian pathways adorned the streets, constructed made of bamboo to ease the movements of the town's folks on unpassable streets. Somehow the floods dried up during dry season and made the flooded streets passable again. The floods made the life of Licabenos very hard as palay dismal harvest made the farmers poorer. The local economy barely grew since its foundation and some families emigrated to the cities to seek better life. Prominent landmark such as \\"Karaanan\\" a low level lake between Villarosa and San Cristobal usually supplied plentiful organic delicacies to townsfolks such as Dalag, Hito, Gurami and edible Frogs during floods that usually graced our table. After so many years of floodings, silts and soils carried by the floods were deposited on the surface of the lake. The former lake vanished and dried up with its soil level rose, that now become precious additional rice fields. Many changes and developments of the town were attributed to the past administrations who contributed road repairs, rehabilitation and constructions to include flood protection with drainage/ canal systems. The present town's executive Mayor Wilfredo Sawit Domingo contributed additional construction and rehabilitated more roads and finally the makeshift bamboo pedestrian lanes on flooded streets are the things of the past. In the outer Barangays farm-to-market roads were constructed in coordination with barangay officers that made farm produce available in the local Market. Accordingly, local merchants made a way to sell their produce to other towns. One of the greatest wisdom of the Mayor was to enter into Sister- Town Agreement between Licab and San Nicolas which was signed on Dec 27, 2013. In the nightlights of the Damili Festival of San Nicolas a historical event of the two sister towns culminated between Mayor Willy and Mayor Melanie Grace Valdez signing the Historical Agreement, which eventually cemented the earlier immigration of Ilocanos from San Nicolas to Licab. During the height of Licab Town Fiesta usually in the last week of the month of March, Mayor Willy introduced the Kariton Festival which was ingeniously celebrated, with each Barangay Captain contributing floats decorated with farm produce skillfully designed to show progress of the town. A large number of Karitons paraded the town and the best ones were to receive Prizes from the festival judges. The show attracted local tourists and former residents from Manila and around the provinces including members of national political parties. Geography About north from Metro Manila, Licab lies in the lowest portion of the province, experiencing two situations: during rainy seasons, being located at the northern portion of the municipality are flood free barangays while the other five (5) barangays are mostly flooded. =Barangays= Licab is politically subdivided into 11 barangays. * Aquino * Linao * Poblacion Norte * Poblacion Sur * San Casimiro * San Cristobal * San Jose * San Juan * Santa Maria * Tabing Ilog * Villarosa =Climate= Demographics Economy Vast ricefields of Licab Agriculture has remained the prime industry of the municipality. Agricultural lands devoted to various agricultural activities cover about tens of thousands hectares out of the total provincial area of 550,718 hectares. Rice is still the prime crop of agricultural development and programs. Palay production in the town is boosted by a large network of irrigation facilities and other appurtenant structure. Live stock production of piggery and poultry were the second agricultural income source in this municipality. Most of the residence were considered to be backyard raisers. Meat products sold in the public market were produced and raised locally.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town is derived from the Ilocano word lupa, the name of an itchy plant found in great abundance within the town and its outskirts at the time of the town‚Äôs foundation in 1913. History During the Spanish rule, the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Nueva Ecija extended to as far south at Cabiao and the towns of San Quintin, Rosales, Balungao and (H)umingan in the north, which later on formed part of the province of Pangasinan. Lupao was a component barrio of Umingan. It remained so until 1871 when some residents led by a Se√±or Calderon petitioned the Governor General for the segregation of Lupao as a barrio of Umingan and the eventual creation of Lupao as ‚ÄúTenencia Absoluta‚Äù to be headed by a Teniente Absoluto. On September 28, 1871, the Govierno Superior Civil de Filipinas decreed the creation of Lupao as Tenencia Absoluta. It signified the formal segregation as barrio and the eventual creation as ‚Äúpueblo‚Äù of the province of Nueva Ecija. Under the Spanish rule, a pueblo is created through the Laws of the Indies and represented a local government unit. The pueblo was an agency of the Central Government. Salvacion was the first barrio of Lupao. Its initial territory also included Barrio Cabaritan now known as San Jose City. Barangay San Roque was known as Odiao and San Isidro as Macaniaoed. Among the first leaders of the municipality during the twilight years of Spanish Rule were Benito Romualdo as ‚ÄúCapitan Municipal‚Äù and Celestino Jabalde as ‚ÄòJuez de Paz‚Äù. In 1898, soon after the Treaty of Paris (1898) was signed and the payment of 20 million pesetas for the possession of the Philippines, the United States Military Government (USMG) issued General Order No. 43 proclaiming the establishment of municipal governments. The Second Philippine Commission (the Taft Commission) acting as the upper house of a bicameral legislature then issued Act No.82 in 1901, ‚ÄúThe 1901 municipal code‚Äù provided for popularly elected presidents (mayor), vice presidents (vice mayor), and councilors to serve on municipal boards. It was only in 1913 that Lupao became a town mainly through the concerted efforts of Gen. Manuel Tinio and Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its founding fathers were Victoriano Joanino, Calixto Laureta, Felix Carpio, Juan Briones, Anacleto Ganareal, Luis Mamaligsa, Gregorio Babagay, Sicto Baclig, Remigio Blas Caoile and Candido Mata. During the Second World War, Japanese Imperial forces was occupied and entering the invaded the towns of Lupao in 1942. In 1945, the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military ground troops was liberated and re-invasion the towns at Lupao and defeats Japanese Imperial forces started the Battle of Lupao and ended World War II. The established of the main headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and United States Army was active on 1945 to 1946 and stationed in Lupao, Nueva Ecija after the Battle of Lupao on 1945 between the Japanese and the combined Filipino-American troops. =Lupao Massacre= During a military operation against the New People's Army on February 10, 1987, seventeen civilians, including an elderly couple and six children, were murdered by the Alpha Company, 14th Infantry (Avengers) Battalion, of the Philippine Army. The murders were carried out by the 14th Infantry after they failed to capture the NPA who had killed the Second Lieutenant Edgar Dizon, the platoon leader of the government troops in a sneak attack the night before. In an act of frustration and anger, the 14th Infantry gathered up unarmed civilians hiding in the rice paddies and murdered them with gunfire and bayonets, leaving 17 dead and 8 wounded, claiming that the dead were members of NPA. All 24 soldiers of the 14th Infantry Battalion were eventually tried before military court but were all acquitted, despite first-hand testimonies of the survivors. This great act of deception and cover-up by the military became known as the infamous \\"Lupao Massacre.\\" On September 25, 2005, three NPA members were killed by soldiers of 71st Infantry Battalion during a hot pursuit operation against seven fully armed NPA in Barangay Cordero, Lupao. Barangays Lupao is subdivided into 24 barangays. * Agupalo Este * Agupalo Weste * Alalay Chica * Alalay Grande * Barangay J.U.Tienzo * Bagong Flores * Balbalungao * Burgos * Cordero * Mapangpang * Namulandayan * Parista * Poblacion East * Poblacion North * Poblacion South * Poblacion West * Salvacion I * Salvacion II * San Antonio Este * San Antonio Weste * San Isidro * San Pedro * San Roque * Santo Domingo Climate Lupao belongs to the first type of climate in the Philippines. This type of climate has two (2) pronounced seasons: dry from the month of November to April and Wet during the rest of the year. This type of climate is typically hot, humid and tropical and is generally affected by the neighboring topography and the prevalent wind direction that varies within the year. Residents in Lupao are called \\"Lupaoenian\\". Ilocano is widely spoken especially in the barrios. Population is predominantly Ilocano in origin, According to the 2007 census, Lupao had a population of 36,832 people, 80% Ilocano and 20% Tagalogs, Kapampangans and Pangasinans. The world war babies, veterans, baby boomers, teachers and farmers composed the majority of the population. Just like any other local municipality, the younger population would leave home to find work in major cities and abroad. Demographics Lupao Town Hall Local Delicacies Due to its history and cultural background, Lupaoenian cuisine is greatly influenced by the Ilocanos and Pangasinenses. Rice is a staple food. Bangus, bagoong and alamang from Dagupan. Tinapa or smoked fish is also a famous dish which was commonly made locally in Ubbog. Locals also love their vegetables such as diningdeng- a concoction of vegetables & fish sauce; and boiled kamote tops. Goat \\"kalding\\" is a common treat for all occasions. It is a common ingredient on dishes such as pinapaitan, kilawin & adobo. The locals are also fond of sweets like tinudok, espasol, puto, tambutambong, tupig, kalamay, ginataang bayabas and ingkiwar. Exotic food such as \\"Tapang usa\\" or venison, \\"Baboy-ramo\\" or wild hog meat, Abu-os \\"ant egg\\" were predominantly catered from Namulandayan brought to city center until the late 1980s, which eventually led to the probable extinction of local deers and hogs in the mountainside.

History The name Nampicuan emanated from the word ‚ÄúNagpicuan‚Äù which means a curve road, originated in a trail called ‚ÄúCurva‚Äù as inhabitants of Pangasinan used to call. According to the first settlers, the site was a sitio named used ‚ÄúSurgue‚Äù or ‚ÄòSULI‚Äù situated in the eastern part of what eventually became the poblacion of Nampicuan and was the point where the feeder road from Moncada, Tarlac turned abruptly north-east towards the town of Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija. The first known settlers were the Ilocanos. They came from Paoay, Ilocos Region, Pangasinan and Zambales. In 1880, having found the soil productive for agricultural purposes, the early settlers cleared the place, cultivate the land and cut down the trees. The trees were sawed into lumber out of which their houses were constructed. At time passes and population continues to grow, more and more demands are made for land and its resources. So much so, on the end of the 19th century, the barrio Nampicuan became a municipality and the first ‚Äúalcalde mayors‚Äù were Andres Tabilangan and Feliciano Cuaresma. Before its formal creation and declaration as a municipality, Nampicuan was then a part and under the political jurisdiction of the town of Cuyapo. In 1903, while the Philippines was still under the American Occupation, Nampicuan was reverted to the status of a barrio of the Cuyapo town. Upon proper presentation however of the prominent residents of this place, Nampicuan was again elevated to the status of municipality. In 1907, the first church was constructed led by REV. Luis Corpuz and the establishment of Gabaldon Primary School under the first Principal/Teacher, Clodualdo Bringas.

According to the , it has a population of people. This is the site of the Pantabangan Dam and Lake. Located in the northern part of Nueva Ecija, Pantabangan is located at the foot of Mt. Mabilog below Mt. Dalimanok which are found between Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountain ranges. It is home to the Pantabangan‚ÄìCarranglan Watershed Forest Reserve. History The place was discovered on November 30, 1645, by Fr. Juan Alonzo de Abarca, an Augustinian priest who with the 29th Spanish mission in the Philippines. The village grew into a settlement and was officially included in the map of the Philippines in 1747. In 1900, Pantabangan formally became a town. In early 16th to 17th centuries, the ‚ÄúId- dules‚Äù (Aetas or Baluga) and Egongots (Ilongots) tribe inhabited the southern Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountains. Based on Mr. Elito V. Circa, a folk visual artist and a writer who wrote most of the Pantabangan-Egongot arts and culture and interviewed some of the Egongot chieftains from Aurora province. He discovered that Pantabangan (Pantabanganan in early 18th century) came from the root Ilongot word \\"Sabangan or Sabanganan\\" that means \\"junction of water streams\\". It was learned that most of the places in Central Luzon were derived from Ilongot word like Caanaoan, Puncan, Cadanglaan (now Carranglan), Kabaritan (Now San Jose City) and others. Bungamong (Bongabon) and Cadanglaan was formerly sitio of Pantabangan and Kabaritan also part of Pantabangan. When the Second World War broke out, Japanese Imperial forces occupied the town municipality of Pantabangan in 1942 under the Japanese Occupation. During the Liberation, combined military forces of the Filipino troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary units and the American troops of the United States Army and the U.S. Army Air Forces came, invaded and recaptured the town of Pantabangan and defeated Japanese soldiers in the Battle of Pantabangan and ended World War II. In May 1966, the Old Philippine Congress passed the Upper Pampanga River Project Act (Republic Act 5499) authorizing the construction of the Pantabangan Dam and its appurtenant structures. The groundbreaking ceremony led by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos took place on June 11, 1971. The project was finally completed in August 1974. The construction of the Dam had great economic and social impact on the lives of Pantabange√±os. About of productive farmland and the town center (East and West Poblacion) along with seven outlying barangays (Villarica, Liberty, Cadaclan, San Juan, Napon-Napon, Marikit and Conversion) were submerged under the new lake. Residents were relocated to higher ground overlooking the vast reservoir, which became the new Pantabangan town center. Before the expansion of the dam through the Casecnan Project in the 1990s, the belfry of the 18th century church resurfaced from the dam's summer low water level. During drought in 1983, some areas of the old town emerged. The Pantabangan Dam is claimed to be the second largest dam in Asia, and supplies the irrigation requirements for about of agricultural lands in Central Luzon. Its power station generates 112 megawatts of hydroelectric power. In February 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos led the ground-breaking ceremony of the Casecnan Transbasin Project, a tunnel from the Casecnan River in Nueva Viscaya to a terminal point at the Pantabangan reservoir and was commissioned on December 11, 2001. The project aims to augment the capacity of the dam to irrigate an additional of agricultural land and generate an additional 140 megawatts of hydroelectric power for the Luzon grid. The present Pantabangan town has 14 barangays and a total land area of about 41,735 hectares. The succeeding years since its relocation saw its progress from a fifth-class municipality in 1975, then to a fourth-class, then to a second class Municipality in 2006 and finally, in July 2008, pursuant to Section 2 of the Department of Finance Order No. 23-08, Pantabangan was reclassified as First- Class Municipality. It is the only town in the Philippines which boasts of three hydroelectric plants within its territorial jurisdiction. Barangays Pantabangan is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.

History Historically, two groups were known to have settled in the area. The main group consisted entirely of the pioneer-settlers who were Ilocanos, while others, who arrived later, were of different tribes with different dialects. They merged and formed a new neighborhood, originally called Bunobon after the bunobon seedlings that thrived in the soil. It became a sitio of Cabucbucan under the jurisdiction of Bongabon municipality. In 1904, sitio Bunobon became a barrio called Nazareth. Because of the steady arrival of new settlers, a council of elders was formed. Selected as head was Apo Juliano Paraiso, one of the eldest within the group, who headed the request to the government to convert Nazareth into an independent town. Through the help of Governor Manuel Tinio and Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon, the request of the elders was approved in 1908. On December 26, 1912 Vice Governor Newton signed the act and simultaneously issued a proclamation creating the town of RIZAL. The town was named after Dr. Jos√© Rizal. On January 1, 1913, Don Julian Paraiso took his oath as the first Alcalde of the Municipality. In 1917 and 1918, the Bureau of Land surveyed the Municipality into homestead and residential lots. In 1930, Barangay Paco Roman became barrio thru the leadership of the late Mr. Florentino Castelo, separating it from Barangay Estrella. Sometime in 1940, General Luna became a barrio of which the area was taken from barangay Canaan and in 1954 Villa Paraiso was created into a barrio separating it from Barangay Canaan and was named in honor of late Mayor Gaudencio V. Paraiso. During World War II, Japanese Imperial forces occupies and entering the town in Rizal in 1942. In 1945, combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops including the local various recognized guerrillas and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas liberated the town and defeated Japanese Imperial forces and ended the Second World War. After the war, many families started business and agricultural and farm lands. In 1954, Rizal lost some of its territory when the barrios of San Felipe and San Alfonso were separated to form the town of Llanera along with some territory from Talavera and San Jose. Casecnan Dam (The Casecnan Irrigation and Power Generation Project). In 1963, Villa Pascua was renamed Barangay Pag-asa which is a part of Barangay Agbanawag. In January 1968, Barangay Casilagan became a barrio thru Res. No. 2 of the Provincial Board on January 3, 1968, which was formerly a sitio of Canaan, which was bisected by the Bulalakay Creek, and it was divided into two barrios known as Canaan Este and Canaan Weste. On July 20, 1970, Sanggunian Panlalawigan passed Resolution No. 220 approving the creation of Barangay Maligaya in accordance with R.A. No. 3590, the area to be taken from the Barangay Bicos and on July 12, 1971 then the Provincial Board Resolution No. 231, Villa Labrador became a Barrio separating it to Villa Paraiso.

It is a statutory corporation whose members are appointed by the Minister for Health. It is regulated by the Health Insurance Authority. Products Vhi Healthcare offers a number of health insurance products. It also has Dental and Travel insurance. Vhi Healthcare has over 1million members. Until 14 December 2006, its main rival in the market was BUPA Ireland but since BUPA's withdrawal, Irish based Laya Healthcare (formerly Quinn Healthcare) and Aviva have emerged as Vhi's main competition. The current Healthcare business model is based on directly paying the consultant and hospital bills of its members. In February 2010 Vhi launched Vhi HomeCare a joint venture providing \\"Hospital in the Home\\" type services, it also provides minor injuries treatment centres through another partnership, Vhi Swiftcare. History The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was created in 1957 under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957 by the Minister for Health Tom O'Higgins. This law has been amended but remains the primary legislation under which Vhi Healthcare operates. The company held a monopoly in the health insurance market in Ireland until 1996, when BUPA entered the market. The company re-branded from \\"VHI ‚Äì Voluntary Health Insurance\\" to \\"Vhi Healthcare\\" in the early 2000s (decade), although the Board's legal name has never been altered. It is expected that the \\"statutory corporation\\" status of Vhi Healthcare will soon be changed to prepare it for more vigorous competition as it is often accused of being a virtual monopoly on private healthcare. While the privatisation of the company is not believed to be imminent, it was reported in the company's 2004 Annual Report that the Minister for Health would change the status of the board into a limited company owned by the state. The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008,http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/acts/2008/a0608.pdf allows the Board to transfer its health insurance functions to a wholly owned subsidiary which will be a private company limited by shares. However, it does not dissolve the Board itself, which will become a holding company. It also requires the health insurance company to achieve the level of reserves that any other authorised insurer is required to have, something it was previously exempt from. Privatisation The Irish Government announced on 27 May 2010 that the company was to be privatised within the next three years. Spokespeople from the Department of Health stated that they did not expect premiums to increase or the loss of any jobs at the 800 strong company. The state expected to invest large sums of money to allow the company gain a solvency ratio in line with regulations and other insurance companies. This coincided with new health risk equalisation measures which were to be rolled out from 2012. The Irish government were looking toward retaining Ireland's history of community rating in health insurance. This decision was, ostensibly, overturned by the coalition government formed after the 2011 Irish General Election. In their Programme for Government, the Coalition committed itself to retaining VHI Healthcare as a state-owned corporation, serving as a public option within a universal health insurance system and modelled on the Dutch healthcare system.

Economy Santa Rosa primarily depends on rice cultivation, vegetable production, commercial fishery, and tricycle sidecar fabrication. Just recently, the town started realizing its development potential. The town's strategic location at the crossroads of two national highways: the Maharlika Highway and the Tarlac-Santa Rosa-Fort Magsaysay Road is accelerating its commercial and industrial development. It is also inevitably set to benefit from the spillover of Cabanatuan's built-up area. As a result, Santa Rosa is gradually replacing agriculture with services and agro-industry as the main engines for growth. The stretch of Maharlika Highway is a growing commercial strip of local entrepreneurs competing with national businesses while the eastern part of the town is attracting investments in large commercial farms. As of 2017,based on Commission on Audit of the Philippines,Santa Rosa economic status reached their Income of P190,671,476.98;Assets of P470,150,569.41;Liabilities of P181,022,725.17 and Allotments of 294,983,551.31. Concurrent to Santa Rosa's rapid growth is the buildup of perennially heavy traffic at the approach to the intersection of the national roads. To address the worsening situation, the local government teamed up with the Cabanatuan city government to construct a road that will bypass the town proper. As for Santa Rosa, only further growth is anticipated when Central Luzon Link Expressway and North Luzon East Expressway finally materialize. Tourism and landmarks Santa Rosa's main landmark includes Santa Rosa Supermarket or \\"Pamilihang Bayan ng Santa Rosa\\", Santa Rosa Town Hall, Santa Rosa Town Park, Santa Rosa Central School, and St. Rose of Lima Parish Church. Other attractions which are most visited by tourists are The famous and old, round-shaped, miraculous chapel of San Mariano known as \\"The Miraculous Round Chapel of San Mariano\\", 18th Century Ancestral Houses in Santa Rosa, a private \\"Gazebo\\" of Cruz Compound in San Mariano, American Air Base and rivers, Mga Munting Bahay-kubo, and scenic rice fields.

The jetliner position, also known as the captain's chair, is a form of physical torment used in cases where the tormentor is unable or unwilling to inflict corporal punishment on the subject. The recipient is made to put their back against a wall or pole and place their feet eighteen inches or so from the base of the object. The feet are usually kept close together. The subject must then slide down the wall or pole until their thighs are parallel to the ground, so that their profile is of someone sitting in a chair. They may also be required to slide their feet back until their shins and thighs are at right-angles to each other, which makes the stresses upon the knee joints and thigh muscles much greater. Variations include placing weight on the subject's head or thighs, or making them hold their arms straight out in front of them, perhaps with a weight clasped in their hands. The result is increasing amounts of pain in the thigh muscles, as well as pain in the knees and ankles. The benefit for the perpetrator is that this kind of punishment causes pain without any lasting marks or, under all but the most extreme conditions, lasting damage to the subjects. In India this method of punishment is often referred to as the chair and was or is used in correcting juvenile delinquents. Also in other countries it was a commonly used punishment.

History The founder of the Qadiriyya, Abdul Qadir Gilani, was a scholar and preacher.Omer Tarin, Hazrat Ghaus e Azam Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani sahib, RA: Aqeedat o Salam, Urdu monograph, Lahore, 1996 Having been a pupil at the madrasa of Abu Sa'id al-Mubarak, he became the leader of this school after al- Mubarak's death in 1119. Being the new sheikh, he and his large family lived in the madrasa until his death in 1166, when his son, Abdul Razzaq, succeeded his father as sheikh. Abdul Razzaq published a hagiography of his father, emphasizing his reputation as founder of a distinct and prestigious Sufi order.Tarin The Qadiriyya flourished, surviving the Mongolian conquest of Baghdad in 1258, and remained an influential Sunni institution. After the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, the legend of Gilani was further spread by a text entitled The Joy of the Secrets in Abdul-Qadir's Mysterious Deeds (Bahjat al- asrar fi ba'd manaqib 'Abd al-Qadir) attributed to Nur al-Din 'Ali al- Shattanufi, who depicted Gilani as the ultimate channel of divine grace and helped the Qadiri order to spread far beyond the region of Baghdad. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Qadiriyya had distinct branches and had spread to Morocco, Spain, Turkey, India, Ethiopia, Somalia, and present-day Mali. Established Sufi sheikhs often adopted the Qadiriyya tradition without abandoning leadership of their local communities. During the Safavid dynasty's rule of Baghdad from 1508 to 1534, the sheikh of the Qadiriyya was appointed chief Sufi of Baghdad and the surrounding lands. Shortly after the Ottoman Empire conquered Baghdad in 1534, Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned a dome to be built on the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, establishing the Qadiriyya as his main allies in Iraq. Khawaja Abdul-Allah, a sheikh of the Qadiriyya and a descendant of Muhammad, is reported to have entered China in 1674 and traveled the country preaching until his death in 1689. One of Abdul-Allah's students, Qi Jingyi Hilal al-Din, is said to have permanently rooted Qadiri Sufism in China. He was buried in Linxia City, which became the center of the Qadiriyya in China. By the seventeenth century, the Qadiriyya had reached Ottoman-occupied areas of Europe. Sultan Bahu contributed to the spread of Qadiriyya in western India. His method of spreading the teachings of the Sufi doctrine of Faqr was through his Punjabi couplets and other writings, which numbered more than 140. He granted the method of dhikr and stressed that the way to reach divinity was not through asceticism or excessive or lengthy prayers but through selfless love carved out of annihilation in God, which he called fana. Sheikh Sidi Ahmad al-Bakka'i ( of the Kunta family, born in the region of the Noun river, d.1504 in Akka) established a Qadiri zawiya (Sufi residence) in Walata. In the sixteenth century the family spread across the Sahara to Timbuktu, Agades, Bornu, Hausaland, and other places, and in the eighteenth century large numbers of Kunta moved to the region of the middle Niger where they established the village of Mabruk. Sidi Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti (1728‚Äì1811) united the Kunta factions by successful negotiation, and established an extensive confederation. Under his influence the Maliki school of Islamic law was reinvigorated and the Qadiriyyah order spread throughout Mauritania, the middle Niger region, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Futa Toro, and Futa Jallon. Kunta colonies in the Senegambian region became centers of Muslim teaching.Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge University Press, p. 409 Features Zawiya (Sufi lodge) in the medina of Libya's capital, Tripoli * Qadiri leadership is not centralised. Each centre of Qadiri thought is free to adopt its own interpretations and practices. * The symbol of the order is the rose. A rose of green and white cloth, with a six- pointed star in the middle, is traditionally worn in the cap of Qadiri dervishes. Robes of black felt are also customary.John Porter Brown, The Dervishes, OUP, 1927 * Names of God are prescribed as chants for repetition by initiates (dhikr). Formerly, several hundred thousand repetitions were required, and obligatory for those who hold the office of sheikh. *Any man over the age of eighteen may be initiated. They may be asked to live in the order's commune (khanqah or tekke) and to recount their dreams to their sheikh. * Celibacy, poverty, meditation, and mysticism within an ascetic context along with worship centered on saint's tombs were promoted by the Qadiriyya among the Hui in China. In China, unlike other Muslim sects, the leaders (Shaikhs) of the Qadiriyya Sufi order are celibate. Unlike other Sufi orders in China, the leadership within the order is not a hereditary position; rather, one of the disciples of the celibate Shaikh is chosen by the Shaikh to succeed him. The 92-year-old celibate Shaikh Yang Shijun was the leader of the Qadiriya order in China as of 1998.

Hungry and miserable people were fed all day in his Tekke without regard for religion. Dawlati Osmaniyya donated money and gifts to his Tekke in Kerkuk. Sultan Abdul-Majid Khan's (Khalife of ƒ∞slam, Sultan of Ottoman Empire) wife Sultana Hatun sent many gifts and donations to his Tekke as a follower. Among his followers were many leaders, rulers, and military and government officials. It was known to everyone that he lived in complete conviction. Because of the example Talibani set as a religious figure, the people's ties to him were solid and strong. After his death, his branch was populated in Turkey, and he was followed by Dede Osman Avni Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj √ñmer H√ºdai Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj Muhammed Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj Mustafa Hayri Baba, and Sheikh Al-Haj Mehmet Baba. =Qadri Noshahi= The Qadri Noshahi silsila (offshoot) was established by Syed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh of Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan, in the late sixteenth century. =Sarwari Qadiri= Also known as Qadiriya Sultaniya, the order was started by Sultan Bahu in the seventeenth century and spread in the western part of Indian Subcontinent. Hence, it follows most of the Qadiriyya approach. In contrast, it does not follow a specific dress code or require seclusion or other lengthy exercises. Its mainstream philosophy is contemplation of belovedness towards God.= =The Qadiriyya‚ÄìMukhtariyya Brotherhood= This branch of the Qadiriyya came into being in the eighteenth century resulting from a revivalist movement led by Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti, a Sufi of the western Sahara who wished to establish Qadiri Sufism as the dominant religion in the region. In contrast to other branches of the Qadiriyya that do not have a centralized authority, the Mukhtariyya brotherhood was highly centralized. Its leaders focused on economic prosperity as well as spiritual well-being, sending their disciples on trade caravans as far away as Europe.Abun-Nasr, Jamil M. \\"The Centralized Sufi Brotherhoods.\\" Muslim Communities of Grace: The Sufi Brotherhoods in Islamic Religious Life. New York: Columbia UP, 2007. 163‚Äì170. =The Qadiriyya Harariya= The founder of the Qadiriyya Harariya tariqa was Shaykh Hachime Harari. His shrine is located in Harar City, Ethiopia. All the shrines of the shaykhs are in Ethiopia and two Shrines of the shaykhs silsila are in Borama City, in the north of Somalia. The current shaykh is Mohamed Nasrudin bin Shaykh Ibrahim Kulmiye of Somalia. The tariqa spread in three countries: Djibouti, Somalia, and Ethiopia. = Qadriyyah Razaviya = Founded by AlaHazrat Imam Ahmad Raza Khan .

Other published titles for the puzzle include Allied Occupation. Rules Fillomino is played on a rectangular grid with no standard size; the internal grid lines are often dotted. (When published as Allied Occupation in the World Puzzle Championship, the cells of the grid are circular, but this is purely an aesthetic concern.) Some cells of the grid start containing numbers, referred to as \\"givens\\". The goal is to divide the grid into polyominoes (by filling in their boundaries) such that each given number n in the grid is part of an n-omino and that no two polyominoes of matching size (number of cells) are orthogonally adjacent (share a side). Unlike some of its contemporaries among puzzles, there need not be a one-to-one correspondence between givens and polyominoes in the solution; it is possible for two givens with matching number to belong to the same polyomino in the solution, and for a polyomino to have no given at all. Solution methods It is common practice in solving a Fillomino puzzle to add numbers to the empty cells when it is determined what size polyomino each must belong to; these numbers are effectively treated identically to the givens. As well as making it clear where many border segments must be drawn - such as between any two differing numbers, or surrounding a region of matching numbers whose quantity is that number - it also permits the second part of the puzzle's rule to be visualized as simply \\"the same number cannot appear on both sides of a border\\", which greatly accelerates solving. A curious side effect of numbering every cell is that when the puzzle is completed, the numbers alone unambiguously define the solution, the actual borders being trivially deducible. This makes communication of a solution without a grid quite feasible; indeed, solutions for Allied Occupation give only the numbers. (Nikoli always publishes solutions to their Fillomino puzzles with both the polyomino borders drawn in and numbers given in every cell.) The typical means of starting a Fillomino puzzle is to draw in the obvious borders between non- matching givens and surrounding all polyominoes completed by the givens alone ('1's, pairs of orthogonally adjacent '2's, and so on). From there, the solver searches for three things, possibly in combination: * Potential overloads. Each polyomino in the solution, if it were completely numbered, would contain matching numbers whose quantity is that number. If there is a place in the grid where adding a particular number would result in an orthogonally contiguous region of too many copies of that number, then borders to that cell from those numbers may be drawn in. Often the givens alone provide these, most commonly a pair of diagonally adjacent '2's: placing a '2' in either of the cells that share a side with both givens would result in an overload, so four cell borders may be drawn in (in the shape of a plus sign) separating the '2's. * Limited domains. Every number in the grid - whether given or deduced - must ultimately be bordered into a region with that number of cells in it. Often, a number will require other cells to be in its region due to not having any alternative location to expand into. The most obvious case is a number (other than '1') bordered on three sides; the cell sharing the fourth side must belong to the same region, and consequently can bear the same number. The same principle applies to numbers bordered on only two sides but cannot possibly expand into enough cells in only one direction, and so on. * Defined cells. In more challenging circumstances, sometimes working with the empty cells is easier than working with numbers. The most obvious case is when a single cell without a number becomes completely surrounded; without any help from other numbers, that cell must be a monomino, and can be marked with '1'. Similarly, two orthogonally adjacent empty cells surrounded together must be a domino, as two monominos cannot share a side. Even cells in regions not completely surrounded may be defined; a common occurrence is for an empty cell as part of a small region mostly bordered by solved polyominoes to have only one legal size of polyomino available to it, with other sizes being too large or would result in matching-size polyominoes sharing a side. This is perhaps best recognized by considering what number can legally be placed in such a cell and determining that only one exists. Variants Fillomino adapts to different geometries; hexagonal grids can be used, with the only change in the rules being replacing all instances of polyomino with polyhex. Another variant was published by Nikoli under the name NIKOJI; letters are used as givens instead of numbers, where the letters and polyominoes have a one-to-one correspondence and only matching letters have matching polyominoes (in size, shape, orientation, and letter position). A computer-based variant of the game in which the player enters numbers (the computer draws the boundaries for the player) is known \\"Filling\\" and is part of the \\"SGT-Puzzles\\" package.http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/ An iOS mobile variant of Fillomino, named Fields, was launched in 2013. https://sperrylabs.com/fields/ References Category:Logic puzzles ","title":"Fillomino"},{"id":"2174886","text":"Baron Wolf von Frankenstein is a fictional character who appears in the Universal film Son of Frankenstein. He is played by Basil Rathbone. History Wolf Frankenstein is the younger son of Henry Frankenstein and brother to Ludwig Frankenstein. He was sent to England when he was very young to receive a proper education. After obtaining his doctoral degree, marrying his girlfriend Elsa, and fathering a son named Peter, he moved to America and began a medical practice where he could live and breathe freely from the bad reputation that came with his family name. However, his father's history caught up with him eventually when Henry finally died leaving his entire estate to Wolf (one can assume that the estate was originally supposed to go to Ludwig, who, true to his disdain for Henry's work, refused it, dumping the burden on his brother). Having spent most of his life away from his ancestral home, Wolf didn't know the whole story of how his father had created the monster, and assumed that the story had become grossly exaggerated over the years. thus, his only reason for accepting the Frankenstein estate was in the hopes of clearing the family name (making him the first of many well- intentioned by nonetheless doomed descendants of Henry) by proving to the people of Frankenstein that his father's work was, at its core, good. Initially this seemed doomed to failure, as everyone in town - with the exception of the open-minded police officer Inspector Krogh - was openly hostile towards Wolf and his family. Regardless, Wolf soldiered on, setting up shop in Henry's old laboratory, during which time he discovered that an old demented man named Ygor (who has a deformed neck upon surviving a hanging upon his graverobbing attempts) had been using the heretofore-abandoned building as a sanctuary. After almost killing one another, Wolf and Ygor seemed to become fast friends, with the old man revealing that not only was his father's creation alive since the destruction of the laboratory in Henry's time, but that the Monster was living in the Frankenstein family crypt and was in poor health. Wolf then sees that his father were buried with the chalk writing on his stone casket stating \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters.\\" Seeing this as an opportunity to fulfill his dream of redeeming his family, Wolf agreed to help Ygor restore the Monster to full health, little knowing that Ygor had sinister plans of his own for the bolt-necked giant. Wolf starts out by using the torch to etch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" in its place. These plans eventually came to light following the disappearance of Wolf's butler Thomas Benson (whom Wolf suspected that the increasingly hostile Ygor) had murdered. Following the deaths of Emil Lang and Edwald Niemuller at the hands of the Monster, Inspector Krogh came calling with dire news: the townspeople rightly blamed Ygor for the killings, but were accusing Wolf of harboring the madman. Realizing that Ygor had lied to him (and concluding that Ygor had in fact killed Benson), Wolf went to the lab to confront him. Ygor knew why Wolf was there and attacked him with a hammer. But Wolf, better armed than his foe, shot Ygor with a revolver and seemingly killed him. Thinking the horror was over, he returned to Krogh, only to find that the Monster (in an effort to avenge the seeming death of his friend) had kidnapped Peter and was threatening to drop the boy into the sulphur pits that existed beneath the laboratory. But thanks to the efforts of Krogh, Peter was saved and Wolf swung on a rope and knocked the Monster into the sulphur instead. After all this, Wolf decided to move back to America with Elsa and Peter. Wolf later handed the keys to the Frankenstein estate over to the townspeople. Wolf was later mentioned in The Ghost of Frankenstein where Ludwig had heard about his brother's encounter with the monster.

Hinds' Feet was written in 1955 and has become a very successful work of Christian fiction, seeing new editions published as recently as July, 2005. Plot introduction It is the story of a young woman named Much Afraid, and her journey away from her Fearing family and into the High Places of the Shepherd, guided by her two companions Sorrow and Suffering. It is an allegory of a Christian devotional life from salvation through maturity. It aims to show how a Christian is transformed from unbeliever to immature believer to mature believer, who walks daily with God as easily on the High Places of Joy in the spirit as in the daily life of mundane and often humiliating tasks that may cause Christians to lose perspective. The book takes its title from Habakkuk 3:19, \\"The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.\\" The story begins at the Valley of Humiliation with Much Afraid, being beset by the unwanted advances of her cousin, Craven Fear, who wishes to marry her. Much Afraid is ugly from all outward appearances, walking on club feet, sporting gnarled, deformed hands, and speaking from a crooked mouth that seems to have been made so by a stroke or the like. The Good Shepherd is tender and gentle with Much Afraid, especially in the beginning. However, His many sudden departures may strike the reader as bizarre, given the human penchant to expect kindly souls to never do anything that may be interpreted as rude or as hurtful in any way. Yet, though the Shepherd leaves in a moment, He returns the same way at the first furtive cry of the forlorn little protagonist. \\"Come, Shepherd, for I am much afraid!\\" When Much Afraid intimates that she would love to be able to dance upon the high places as do the sure-footed deer, the Shepherd commends her for this desire. In order to accomplish this, he offers to \\"plant the seed of love\\" into her heart. At first sight of the long, black hawthorn-looking seed, she shrieks in fear. Soon, she relents, and after the initial intense pain, she senses that something is indeed different in her, though she still looks the same, for now. Just when the reader thinks that Much Afraid is about to reach the High Places, the path turns downward towards a seemingly endless desert. There is incident with an extremely high cliff that must be ascended by a steep, slippery and very narrow zig-zagging track, with the help of her two companions, Sorrow and Suffering. Then days are spent in a forest that is shrouded in a thick cloud of fog. During this time Much Afraid is sequestered with her two friends in a log cabin. The climax is an unexpected twist that comes as Much Afraid despairs of ever reaching the High Places. Allusions/references to other works The book bears some stylistic similarities to John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. The name of the protagonist, Much-Afraid, also appears first in Bunyan's work.

He is god of justice therefore known as Dharmaraja. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding heaven or the hell for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth Manasputra of Lord Brahma. Chitragupta is believed to be created from Bramha's soul and mind (chitt) and thus, allotted the right to write Vedas like Brahmins with the duty of a Kshatriya, He accompanies Yamraj, the god of death.https://detechter.com/lord-chitragupta-who-helps-lord-yamaraj-to- maintain-karmic-accounts/ In scriptures Yama's Court and Hell. The Blue figure is Yama with Yami and Chitragupta, 17th-century painting * According to the Vedic scriptures, the souls of men after death receive rewards and punishments according to their sins and virtues, and hence it is believed that good and bad deeds of men are not destroyed. The souls of men after death go to Yamapuri, which is presided over by the deities called Yamas who keep records of men's actions and accordingly give them their dues. The principal Yama is called Yamaraja or Dharamaraja, that is, the ruler of Yamapuri or the king of laws. A large central panel portrays Yama the god of death (often referred to as Dharma) seated on a throne; to the left stands a demon. To the right of Yama sits Chitragupta, assigned with keeping detailed records of every human being and upon their death deciding how they are to be reincarnated, depending on their previous actions. *The Yama Samhita, an extract from the 9th chapter of Ahilya Kamdhenu, a work of Hindu Law, says that Dharamaraja complained to Brahma about his difficulties in performing his most responsible duties of keeping records of the deeds of men and doing justice to them. Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: \\"Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called Kayastha and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny.\\" He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Dharmaraja married his daughter Irawati to Chitragupta and Sraddhadeva Manu(Manu), son of Surya (the Sun) married his daughter Sudakhina(some people say dakshina or nandini) to him.\\" Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik. *Padma Purana after stating the legend says: \\"Chitragupta was placed near Dharamaraj to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Lord Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth.\\" *Bhavishya Purana states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men. *Vignana Tantra says the same thing. *The same is the enjoinment of Brahma to Chitragupta according to Brihat Brahma Khanda. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession. *Garuda Purana describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamapuri holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men). *The Mahabharata (Anusasan Parva, chapter 130) recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds. Legends Chitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas ‚Äî Brahmin (The Learned), Kshatriya (The Warriors), Vaishya (Merchant & Farmers) and Shudra (Labourer) ‚Äî ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds ‚Äî good and evil ‚Äî of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Dharamraj, however, complained, \\"O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis (life-forms) in the three worlds\\" Brahma went into meditation for 11,000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: Brahma then enjoined him to dispense justice and punish those who violated the dharma. In the Garuda Purana, Chitragupta is hailed as the \\"giver of letters\\" (Chitragupta namastubhyam vedaksaradatre).

Most recently he coached FK LiepƒÅja. Starkovs has managed clubs such as Spartak Moscow in Russia, FK Baku in Azerbaijan and Skonto FC in Latvia as well as the Latvia national football team from 2001 to 2004 and from 2007 to July 2013. Since 2017 till 2018, he was the manager for the Latvia national football team. Playing biography Starkovs started playing football in Madona where he played for the local Olimpija Madona playing for which he was selected the best forward of the 1969 Latvia Leather ball tournament. In 1975 Starkovs joined FK Daugava Rƒ´ga. In 1978 Starkovs went to FC Dynamo Moscow but it wasn't the right team for him, so soon Starkovs was back in Riga. However his best years were still to come - in 1980s Starkovs was one of the best snipers of the Soviet first league, scoring over a hundred goals for Daugava. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Latvia by the Latvian Football Federation as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. Coaching career As a team manager Starkovs made his name with Skonto FC which he brought to innumerable Latvian championships. He also worked with Latvia national under-21 football team and in 2001 he was appointed the general manager of Latvian national team. He took over the Latvian national team after its disastrous performance in 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and lead the team to its biggest success ever, qualifying for Euro 2004 with a victory over World Cup bronze medalist Turkey. After his success as the national team coach, he joined Spartak Moscow winning the silver medal of the Russian league in 2005, but in April 2006 he was forced to quit due to total obstruction from the team's fans and a conflict with former team captain Dmitri Alenichev. Starkovs returned to Latvia in 2007 and took over the Latvian national team, which had been struggling under Jurijs Andrejevs. In late 2009 Starkovs accepted the offer to manage Skonto FC and officially became the manager of the club in January 2010 as Paul Ashworth left. His return was explicitly successful as he managed to win the league. In January 2011 Starkovs left Skonto FC, signing a contract in Azerbaijan with FC Baku. Besides the work with the Azerbaijan Premier League club he still remained the manager of Latvia national football team. Following series of unsuccessful matches Starkovs left his position on 15 July 2013, being replaced by the former Southampton F.C. star Marians Pahars.http://apollo.tvnet.lv/zinas/pahars-latvijas-izlase-katru-dienu- stradasu-ar-100-atdevi/577029 Having been linked with potential moves to various clubs and national teams over time, Starkovs, though, has not taken office at any of them, stating he is \\"waiting for an interesting offer football- wise\\".http://sportacentrs.com/futbols/izlases/02122014-la_starkovam_ir_piedavajums_vadit_kadas_v He is currently working at the Latvian Football Federation as the chairman of the National teams' committee.

Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204 (1923), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian Sikh man who identified himself as an Aryan, was ineligible for naturalized citizenship in the United States.. In 1919, Thind filed a petition for naturalization under the Naturalization Act of 1906 which allowed only \\"free white persons\\" and \\"aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent\\" to become United States citizens by naturalization. After his petition was granted, Government attorneys initiated a proceeding to cancel Thind's naturalization and a trial followed in which the Government presented evidence of Thind's political activities as a founding member of the Ghadar Party, an Indian independence movement headquartered in San Francisco. Thind did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he attempted to be classified as a \\"free white person\\" within the meaning of the Naturalization Act based on the fact that Indians and Europeans share common descent from Proto-Indo-Europeans. Thind was represented by a fellow Indian American, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, a California attorney. The court unanimously rejected Thind's argument, holding that while Indians shared common ancestry with Europeans, they did not meet a \\"common sense\\" definition of white. Background Bhagat Singh Thind had come to the United States in 1913 for higher studies after obtaining a bachelor's degree in India. He enlisted in the United States Army, became a Sergeant and served in the First World War. He was discharged honorably with his character designated as \\"excellent\\". Thind was granted citizenship in Washington state in July 1918 but his citizenship was rescinded in just four days. He received his citizenship for the second time in Oregon state in November 1920 after the Bureau of Naturalization was unsuccessful in its efforts to stall it in Oregon court. The case then reached the Supreme Court, where Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, a California attorney and fellow immigrant, represented Thind. Argument Thind argued that Indo-Aryan languages are indigenous to the Aryan part of India in the same way that Aryan languages are indigenous to Europe, highlighting the linguistic ties between Indo-Aryan speakers and Europeans, as most European languages including English are similar to Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi. Since the Ozawa v. United States court case had just decided that the meaning of white people for the purposes of the Court were people who were members of the Caucasian race, Thind argued that he was a white person by arguing that he was a member of the Caucasian race.Warnke, G. (2007). After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Gender. Cambridge University Press: New York. Thind argued using \\"a number of anthropological texts\\" that people in Punjab and other Northwestern Indian states belonged to the \\"Aryan race\\", and Thind cited scientific authorities such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach as classifying Aryans as belonging to the Caucasian race. Thind argued that, although some racial mixing did indeed occur between the Indian castes, the caste system had largely succeeded in India at preventing race-mixing. Thind argued that by being a \\"high-caste, of full Indian blood\\" he was a \\"Caucasian\\" according to the anthropological definitions of his day. Thind's lawyers argued that Thind had a revulsion to marrying an Indian woman of the \\"lower races\\" when they said, \\"The high-caste Hindu regards the aboriginal Indian Mongoloid in the same manner as the American regards the Negro, speaking from a matrimonial standpoint.\\"Bigsby, C. (2006). The Cambridge companion to modern American culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Thind's lawyers argued that Thind had a revulsion to marrying a woman of the Mongoloid race. This would characterize Thind as being both white and someone who would be sympathetic to the existing anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. Verdict Associate Justice George Sutherland said that authorities on the subject of race were in disagreement over which people were included in the scientific definition of the Caucasian race, so Sutherland instead chose to rely on the common understanding of race rather than the scientific understanding of race. Sutherland found that, while Thind may claim to have \\"purity of Aryan blood\\" due to being \\"born in Village Taragarh Talawa near Jandiala Guru, Amritsar, Punjab\\", he was not Caucasian in the \\"common understanding\\", so he could not be included in the \\"statutory category as white persons\\". The Court reiterated its holding in [Ozawa v. United States], explaining that the words \\"free white person\\" in the naturalization act were \\"synonymous with the word 'Caucasian' only as that word is popularly understood,\\" pointing out that the statutory language was to be interpreted as \\"words of common speech and not of scientific origin, ... written in the common speech, for common understanding, by unscientific men.\\" Justice Sutherland wrote in his summary: United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, Certificate From The Circuit Court Of Appeals For The Ninth Circuit., No. 202. Argued January 11, 12, 1923.‚ÄîDecided February 19, 1923, United States Reports, v. 261, The Supreme Court, October Term, 1922, 204‚Äì215. The 1910 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry on \\"Hinduism\\" that Justice Sutherland cites as his sole source for this history contradicts his conclusion about the Aryans of Thind's birthplace in the Punjab and explicitly refers to the Aryans of India as part of \\"the white race.\\" The Court nonetheless also concluded that \\"the term 'Aryan' has to do with linguistic, and not at all with physical, characteristics, and it would seem reasonably clear that mere resemblance in language, indicating a common linguistic root buried in remotely ancient soil, is altogether inadequate to prove common racial origin.\\"Chi, S. & Robinson, E.M. (2012). Voices of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Experience (vol. 1). pp. 341. USA: Greenwood. The Court argued that the exclusion of non-whites was based on the idea of racial difference rather than the idea that one race is superior or inferior to another race. The Court argued that the racial difference between Indians and whites was so great that the \\"great body of our people\\" would reject assimilation with Indians. In conclusion, the Court also noted that \\"Congress, by the Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874, c. 29, ¬ß 3, has now excluded from admission into this country all natives of Asia within designated limits of latitude and longitude, including the whole of India,\\" suggesting its intention that natives of India also be excluded from eligibility for naturalized citizenship. Aftermath As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision finding that no person of Indian origin could become a naturalized American, the first person from the Indian subcontinent to become an American citizen, A. K. Mozumdar, had his citizenship revoked. A decision on his appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that revocation. Not only were new applicants from India denied the privilege of naturalization, but the new racial classification suggested that the retroactive revocation of naturalization certificates granted to Asian Indians, of which there were many, might be supported by the Court's decision, a point that some courts upheld when United States attorneys petitioned to cancel the naturalization certificates previously granted to many Asian Indians. Up to fifty Indian-Americans had their citizenship revoked between 1923 and 1927 as a consequence of the Thind ruling. Even Thind's own lawyer, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, was targeted for denaturalization. However, Pandit successfully argued before the Ninth Circuit that revoking his citizenship would do him and his wife unfair harm under the equitable estoppel doctrine. His citizenship was upheld, and the Bureau of Naturalization subsequently cancelled its pending denaturalization cases against Indian-Americans. Some of the consequences of revoked naturalized status are illustrated by the example of some Asian Indian landowners living in California who found themselves under the jurisdiction of the California Alien Land Law of 1913. Specifically, Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb was very active in revoking Indian land purchases; in a bid to strengthen the Asiatic Exclusion League, he promised to prevent Indians from buying or leasing land. Under intense pressure, and with Immigration Act of 1917 preventing fresh immigration to strengthen the fledgling Indian-American community, many Indians left the United States, leaving only half their original American population, 2,405, by 1940. Thind petitioned for naturalization a third time in 1935 after the Congress passed the Nye-Lea Act, which made World War I veterans eligible for naturalization regardless of race. Based on his status as a veteran of the United States military during World War I, he was finally granted United States citizenship nearly two decades after he first petitioned for naturalization. Numerous instances also exist of na√Øve clerks, or clerks acting in protest, granting citizenship to Asian Indian and other Asian immigrants in defiance of the Supreme Court. As public support for Asian Indians grew throughout World War II, and as India's independence came closer to reality, Indians argued for an end to their legislative discrimination. The repeal of Chinese exclusion laws in 1943 and the granting of naturalization privileges to Chinese encouraged Asian Indians to hope for similar gains. Hurdling over many members of Congress and the American Federation of Labor, which vehemently opposed removing legislative measures barricading Indian immigration and naturalization, the Asian Indian community finally succeeded in gaining support among several prominent congressmen, as well as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The support culminated in the signing into law by President Truman on July 2, 1946, of the Luce‚ÄìCeller Act. This Act reversed the Thind decision by explicitly extending racial eligibility for naturalization to natives of India, and set a token quota for their immigration at 100 per year.

Organizations need to be able to quickly assemble teams backed by the support services, information, and material to do the job. To do so, these teams need to find and assess sources of services that are potential participants in the team effort. To support this initial team and resource development, information needs to be developed via analysis tools that help make sense of sets of data sources in an Intranet or Internet. Part of the process is to characterize them, partition them, and sort and filter them. These tools focus on three key issues in forming a collaborative team: #Help individuals responsible for forming the team understand what is available. #Assist team members in identifying the structure and categorize the information available to them in a manner specifically suited to the task at hand. #Aid team members to understand the mappings of their information between their organization and that used by others who might participate.

Oxford University Press. Web. 12 August 2018 Life Henley-on-Thames from the Wargrave Road, Oxfordshire Jan Siberechts was born in Antwerp, the son of a sculptor with the same name. He trained in Antwerp with his father and became a master in the local Guild of Saint Luke by 1648. It is possible but not certain that in the late 1640s, early 1650s he visited Italy. He married Maria-Anna Croes in Antwerp in 1652.Jean Siberechts at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 22, pp. 372‚Äì375 He developed a personal style of painting landscapes, which impressed George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham when he visited Antwerp in 1670. The Duke invited the artist to England. Pasture with sleeping shepherdesses Siberechts arrived in England around 1672 and spent the first three years in England painting decorations in the Duke‚Äôs newly built Cliveden House at Taplow, Buckinghamshire, England.Helen Jacobsen, Luxury and Power: The Material World of the Stuart Diplomat, 1660-1714, Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 82‚Äì83 From the second part of the 1670s and in the 1680s he travelled widely in England completing numerous commissions for aristocratic clients. He lived in London where one of his daughters was a lace-maker for the Queen. His younger daughter, Frances, married the Flemish √©migr√© sculptor Artus Quellinus III (known in England as 'Arnold Quellinus') and, after being widowed, John Nost, another Flemish √©migr√© sculptor.Jan Siberechts 1627‚Äìc.1700 at Tate BritainPatrick O'Brien, Urban Achievement in Early Modern Europe: Golden Ages in Antwerp, Amsterdam and London, Cambridge University Press, 12 Apr 2001, p. 219 Whilst in London he was commissioned to paint the Belsize Estate of goldsmith banker John Coggs in 1696, which now hangs in the Tate Gallery London.Jan Siberechts, View of a House and its Estate in Belsize, Middlesex at the Tate Gallery He died in London. John Wootton was one of his pupils.Jan Siberechts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work About 100 of his works have been preserved. His early works were indebted to Dutch Italianate landscape painters such as Nicolaes Berchem and Karel Dujardin.Cornelis de Bie, Het Gulden Cabinet, 1660, p. 373 Siberechts must have become acquainted with their work in Antwerp as these artists were mainly active in Rome and Siberechts possibly did not visit Italy himself although such a visit in the late 1640s, early 1650s cannot be excluded. In the 1660s he developed a very personal style of landscape painting, with an emphasis on the Flemish countryside and country life. He introduced into the foreground of his landscapes figures of robust country girls, dressed in bright red, blue and yellow. These countrywomen are shown traveling in carts, on foot and on the backs of mules and in the act of carrying objects, bundles or baskets or crossing flooded roads or fords. The volumetric modeling and the manner in which they are set against brightly lit areas of the countryside make the figures stand out from the picture. The artist used the figures to play with the visual effects produced by the figures in the water. Landscape with rainbow, Henley-on-Thames His later landscapes painted in England in the 1670s and 1680s retained their Flemish character by representing a universal theme. This stands in contrast to Dutch landscape paintings of the period, which typically concentrated on a single aspect of a landscape. Siberechts' landscapes depicted powerful trees and soft light on distant hills while the figures became less important than the landscape itself. The foreground was kept relatively dark in order to draw attention to the broad, brightly lit vista in the background. Wollaton Hall and Park, Nottinghamshire Siberechts also painted hunting scenes for his English patrons. These are the earliest country house portraits in England. He used a fairly standardised composition for these hunting scenes: the hunting scene with the huntsmen and horsemen in the foreground and a naturalistic view of the stately home as the backdrop, placed in a misty and atmospheric landscape. He adopted a bird's-eye view that allowed a maximum amount of detail to be depicted. These country house portraits had an important influence on English landscape painting and Siberechts can be regarded as the 'father of British landscape'. These landscapes also have an important historic and topographical interest.

Life Tijani was born in 1735 in Ain Madi, the son of Muhammad al-Mukhtar. He traced his descent according to the Berber custom, to his mother's tribe, Tijania. When he was sixteen, Tijani lost both parents as a result of a plague. By then he was already married. He learned Quran under the tutelage of Mohammed Ba'afiyya in Ain Madi and also studied Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi's Islamic jusrispudence works that were written under Malikite rites. He also studied Ab≈´ al-QƒÅsim al-Qushayrƒ´'s Risala ila al-sufiyya. In 1757, Tijani left his village for Fez. While there, he joined three Sufi brotherhoods, the Qadiriyya, the Nasiriyya, and the tariqa of Ahmad al-Habib b. Muhammed. In Fez, he met a seer who told him he would achieve spiritual revelation (fath). Thereafter, he left Fez to teach at al-Abiad, spending five years at the village. In 1772, he began a journey to Mecca for hajj and to seek a Sufi way of life. During his journey, he was initiated into the Khalwati order at Azwawi. He later taught for a year at Tunis where he achieved some success. He left Tunis for Egypt where he met Mahmud al-Kurdi of the Khalwati order in Cairo. Tijani reached Mecca in late 1773 and performed hajj rites. In his quest to seek a Sufi way of life, he met Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah El Hindi, who rarely saw people except for his servant. He also met Abd-karim al-Sammman, founder of the Sammaniyya branch of Khalwati. Al-Samman told Tijani he will become a dominant qutb (pole) or scholar within the Sufi orders in the region. Tijani left Mecca and returned to Cairo where he got al-Kurdi's blessing to preach the Khalwatiyya order. From Cairo he settled at Tlemcen for a couple of years. The oasis of Boussemghoun in Algeria, where al-Tijani established his tariqa in 1781 Tijani later settled at Boussemghoun, an oasis seventy five miles south of El Bayadh. It was at Samghun that Tijani received a vision from the prophet who told him to start a new Sufi order. He left his previous affiliations with other Sufi orders and claimed divine instructions from prophet Mohammed, Thus, the year 1781 marks the beginning of the Tijaniyya order. Tijani's order soon gained attraction in the desert regions surrounding Abi Samghun. Shaykh Tijani lived in Abi Samghun for about fifteen years. In 1796 he went to Fez. Zawiya complex in Fez, Morocco In Fez, Tijani was well received by Mawlay Sulayman, the Moroccan Sultan. Though Sulayman disliked other Sufi orders, he provided Tijani a house and appointed him as a member of his learned council. At first, Tijani chose the mosque of Mawlay Idris to pray but performed the rites of the Tijani order in his house. Tijani later built his own zawiya. In Fez, he sent his trusted aides to spread the word of his order. Trusted aides such as Abu Hafs' Abdul-Rahman was sent to Oran and Algiers and Abdul-Salam al-Waghiri to Constantine, Algeria. Further muqaddams were appointed among learned converts including Muhammad Fuwadir al-Abdallawi in the Jarid district of Tunisia and Muhammed al-Hafiz in Mauritania. Tijani assigned to himself the title of Qutb al-Aqtab (or the Pole of the Poles) and Khatm al-Walayya al-Muhammadiyya (or the Seal of Muhammadan Sainthood). Seal of sainthood He is quoted as saying Sources on the life of Al-Tijani The greater part of the life and teaching of Shaykh Tijani can be drawn from two primary hagiographical works: #Kitab Jawahir al-ma'ani wa-bulugh al-amani fi fayd Sidi Abil al-Abbas at-Tijani (Gems of Indications and Attainment of Aspirations in the Overflowings of Sidi Abil Abbas Tijani) by Sidi Ali Harazem Berrada (d. 1797), and #Kitab al-Jami‚Äôa li-ma f-taraqa mina-l ‚Äòulumn (The Absolute in What Has Separated from the Sciences) by Sidi Mohammed ibn al- Mishri Sibai Hassani Idrissi (d. 1809). Later hagiographies tend to be works of compilation drawn from these two primary sources. Such hagiographies are: #Kitab Rima'h al-Hizb al Rahim ala Nuhur Hizb ar-Rajim (The Spears of the League of the Merciful thrown at the Necks of the League of the Accursed) by Sidi Omar ibn Said al-Futi (d.1864), # Kitab Bughyat al-mustafid li-shar'h minyat al-murid (Aspiration of the Beneficiary in Commenting the 'Demise of the Disciple') by Sidi Mohammed ibn al-Arbi Sayeh (d.1894), and last but not least, #Kitab Kashf al-Hijab 'amman talaaqa bi-Shaykh Tijani mina-l As'hab (Raising the Veil of the Companions who encountered with Shaykh Tijani) by Sidi Ahmed ibn al-'Iyyashi Skirej al-Fasi (d.1940). Most of what we know about Shaykh Tijani comes from these books. Notes References *Davidson, Basil; Africa in History.

Heavy-duty Albion CX24 recovery truck Albion Reiver 1963 Albion Commercial Vehicles at Biggar Vintage Rally, August 2008 Originally known as Albion Motor Car Company Ltd, the company was founded in 1899 by Thomas Blackwood Murray and Norman Osborne Fulton (both of whom had previously been involved in Arrol-Johnston). Murray's father, John Lamb Murray mortgaged the Heavyside estate in Biggar, South Lanarkshire, to provide the initial capital. They were joined a couple of years later by John F Henderson who provided additional capital. The factory was originally on the first floor of a building in Finnieston Street, Glasgow and had only seven employees. In 1903 the company moved to new premises in Scotstoun.Albion National Road Transport Hall of Fame In April 1931, the Albion Motor Car Company Ltd was renamed Albion Motors Limited.

In 1969, the company took over the neighbouring Coventry Ordnance Works on South Street, which it used for truck component manufacture. British Leyland eliminated the Albion name in 1972 with the products continuing to be built at the same factory under the Leyland brand.No more Albions - they become Leylands Commercial Motor 1 September 1972 In 1980, vehicle production at the former Albion factory ceased, moving to the British Leyland plant at Bathgate, however component manufacturing continued.LV on quality street Commercial Motor 22 November 1980 British Leyland became Rover Group between 1986 and 1997 the component manufacturing plant became part of Leyland DAF, the newly formed British arm of the Anglo-Dutch company DAF NV, formed by the merger of Rover Group's Leyland Trucks division and the Dutch DAF Trucks company. Following the collapse of DAF in 1993, Leyland DAF went into receivership, and the truck components business in Scotstoun was subject to a management buyout and transferred to a newly created company called Albion Automotive.Component and axle plants merge Commercial Motor 2 December 1993 In 1998, Albion Automotive was acquired by American Axle & Manufacturing Company of Detroit.Briefs Commercial Motor 15 October 1998 The new company manufactures axles, driveline systems, chassis systems, crankshafts and chassis components.AAM Europe creates new centre of excellence in Glasgow Scottish Enterprise 2 October 2012 =Passenger car manufacturing= In 1900 the company built its first motor car, a rustic-looking dogcart made of varnished wood, powered by a flat-twin 8hp engine with gear-change by \\"Patent Combination Clutches\\" and solid tyres. In 1903 Albion introduced a 3115 cc 16 hp vertical-twin, followed in 1906 by a 24 hp four. One of the specialities the company offered was solid-tyred shooting-brakes. The last private Albions were powered by a 15 hp monobloc four of 2492 cc. Passenger car production ceased in 1915 but in 1920 the company announced that estate cars were available again based on a small bus chassis, it is not known if any were actually made.

During World War I they built for the War Office large quantities of 3 ton trucks powered by a 32 hp engine using chain drive to the rear wheels. After the war many of these were converted for use as charabancs. Trucks and buses (single and double deckers) were manufactured in the Scotstoun works until 1980 (1972 for complete vehicles). The buses were exported to Asia, East Africa, Australia, India and South Africa. Almost all Albion buses were given names beginning with \\"V\\", these models being the Victor, Valiant, Viking, Valkyrie, and Venturer.

The Chieftain had a 6 speed gearbox, 6th being an overdrive gear, with a worm and wheel rear axle. Bus production The earliest buses were built on the A10 truck chassis with two being delivered to West Bromwich in 1914. Newcastle upon Tyne also took double deckers around this time, but Albion did not produce a purpose-built double deck chassis until 1931. In 1923 the first dedicated bus chassis was announced derived from the one used on the 25 cwt truck but with better springing. Bodies seating from 12 to 23 passengers were available. A lower frame chassis, the Model 26, with 30/60 hp engine and wheelbases from to joined the range in 1925. All the early vehicles had been normal control, with the engine in front of the driver but in 1927 the first forward control with the engine alongside the driver was announced as the Viking allowing 32 seats to be fitted. Diesel engines, initially from Gardner, were available from 1933. The first double deck design was the Venturer of 1932 with up to 51 seats. The CX version of the chassis was launched in 1937 and on these the engine and gearbox were mounted together rather than joined by a separate drive shaft. Albion's own range of diesel engines was also made available. After World War II, the range was progressively modernised and underfloor engined models were introduced with two prototypes in 1951 and production models from 1955 with the Nimbus. With the Leyland take over the range was cut back. The last Albion double decker was the 1961 Lowlander and that was marketed in England as a Leyland, and the last design of all was the Viking, re-using an old name. =Bus models= *Model 24 (1923‚Äì1924) First purpose built Albion bus chassis *Viking 24 (1924‚Äì1932) Various wheelbases from to Front wheel brakes from 1927.

The production started in 1962, the first users were the Italian Carabinieri, Italian State Police and the Guardia di Finanza even though in limited number, only in 1978 it was widely issued replacing the old Beretta MAB. In 1962 the Italian Army bought a limited number of Franchi LF57 submachine gun, judged better than the M12 but never issued to the troops, and only in 1992 the M12S2 variant was introduced also if in very limited number. The Italian Air Force, instead, bought many M12S and M12S2 for the airport security units. However the weapon had a higher initial success in the Arab countries and South America. Its debut in combat came during the Tet Offensive in 1968 when the US Marines guarding the U.S. embassy in Saigon repelled the assault by the Viet Cong using the Beretta M12. It is also used by various South American, African and Asian countries, and made under licence in Brazil by Taurus, in Belgium by FN Herstal and in Indonesia by PT Pindad. Development In 1959, Beretta weapons designer Domenico Salza revisited an old project, the Armaguerra Cremona OG44 submachine gun, in order to make a new submachine gun to replace the old MAB model 1938. The Model 12 was the final production model, and was followed ten years later by the M12S with differences in the safety and other mechanics. Design details The Model 12 weighs 3.48 kilograms empty (about 3.820 kg loaded) and is 660 millimeters in length with stock extended (418 mm when retracted). Its short length is achieved by use of a barrel recessed into the bolt head, known as a telescoping bolt. This reduces length without reducing barrel length or bolt weight. It fires from an open bolt and has a cyclic rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute. The barrel and rifling are chromium-plated to prevent fouling. The bolt housing has grooves to allow bolt movement, even in extremely adverse conditions such as exposure to mud, dust, or sand. The exterior surfaces of the firearm are finished with epoxy resin coating for protection against corrosion and damage. The weapon has a selective-fire option allowing a choice of single shot or fully automatic fire. The weapon has three safeties: a manual safety which blocks the trigger; an automatic safety on the rear grip which immobilizes the trigger and blocks the bolt in a closed position; and a safety on the cocking handle locking the bolt in case it does not retract sufficiently. The weapon is provided with a front sight (adjustable for elevation and windage) and a rear sight with a two-position flip aperture (up to 100 m and up to 200 m). The gun is equipped with a side folding stock, but is also seen rarely with a fixed stock. 20-, 32-, and 40-round box magazines were available for the original Model 12, which was chambered for the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. Variants The first variant was introduced, in limited number, at the end of the '60s for the Italian Navy special forces and is easily recognizable from the longer barrel, about one inch, and the presence of a birdcage-type flash suppressor. It has been replaced by the Heckler & Koch MP5. The Model 12 was redesigned as the Beretta Model 12S in 1978. The Model 12s uses a 32-round box magazine, and is chambered for the 9√ó19 mm NATO cartridge. A novel feature is the grip safety, which locks the trigger and the bolt in the closed position, thus safeguarding against accidental firing if the grip is not held firmly or if the gun is dropped. The safety and fire-selector switch, which in the original Model 12 were two separate push-pin button (with the fire-selector being a button that activated single-fire or burst fire whether it was pushed on the right side or the left side) have been re-engineered in a modern lever-type selector with three positions (S for \\"Sicura\\" or Safety, 1 for Single-fire, R for \\"Raffica\\" or Burst fire). The fixed firing pin on the face of the bolt can strike the primer only when the cartridge is chambered fully, and this also avoids accidental firing, according to its designers. The PM12S was also designed with easy field-stripping and reassembly in mind, which has been simplified and can be accomplished without tools. It can be equipped with a suppressor, but this requires a slight modification of the barrel by a competent gunsmith. Minus the suppressor and other optional features, the Beretta PM12S is made up of 84 discrete components. The current version of the Beretta Model 12, is called the PM12-S2. In the mid-1980s the Italian Carabinieri, after a misfire accident, asked for a modification, in the form of a further safety device, which allowed both to keep the bolt of the weapon in half-cocked position and acted as an interceptor preventing accidental fire should the bolt or the firing pin suddenly disengage. This modification was implemented as a standard factory feature, and the denomination of the submachine gun changed to PM12-S2; this is the only Model 12 variant currently manufactured by Beretta.

She was destroyed by fire in 1883. Description The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was powered by a 2-cylinder steam engine having cylinders of diameter by stroke. Rated at 200 nhp, it drove a single screw propeller, giving a speed of . She was assessed at , . History Memphis was built by William Denny and Brothers, Dumbarton, United Kingdom for Peter Denny and Thomas Begbie. She was launched on April 3, 1862. Her port of registry was London and the United Kingdom Official Number 44836 was allocated. =Civil War service= Confederate blockade runner Memphis ‚Äî on her maiden voyage, while running the Union blockade of Confederate ports on June 23, 1862 ‚Äî ran aground off Sullivan's Island, South Carolina while attempting to enter Charleston harbor. Efficient work by Southern troops got her partially unloaded on the following day, and she was towed to safety by the steamships Etiwan and Marlon before Federal warships could hit her with shell fire. They were kept at bay by gunfire from Fort Beauregard. Memphis was captured by sidewheel gunboat outbound from Charleston with a cargo of cotton on July 31, 1862, and purchased by the Union Navy from a prize court at New York City on September 4, 1862. (public domain) Union blockade ship Memphis was commissioned on October 4, 1862, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Pendleton G. Watmough in command. Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Memphis sailed for Charleston and began service on October 14 with the capture of British steamer Ouachita bound for Havana, Cuba. She continued patrol in 1862‚Äì1863. On January 4, 1863, she joined sidewheel steamer in taking Confederate sloop Mercury with a cargo of turpentine for Nassau, Bahamas. On January 31, Confederate ironclads CSS Palmetto State and CSS Chicora made a dash out of Charleston Harbor into the midst of the blockading ships. Screw steamer was rammed and disabled by Palmetto State while sidewheel steamer was next attacked and left for Memphis to take in tow. The two rams then retired. By March of the following year, Memphis was operating in the North Edisto River. On March 6, 1864, Confederate torpedo boat CSS David attempted a run on the Union blockader. The spar torpedo struck Memphis port quarter but did not explode. After her second torpedo misfired, David retreated upstream out of range of her foe's heavy guns. Memphis, uninjured, continued her blockading duties to the end of the Civil War. =Post-war= On May 6, 1867, Memphis was decommissioned, and sold to V. Brown & Co., at New York on May 8, 1869. Renamed Mississippi, She was sold to William Weld & Co. of Boston, Massachusetts. She was sold c.1875 to Frederick Baker, Boston. In 1879, she was sold to H. Hastings & Co., Boston. Mississippi was sold in 1881 to Edward Lawrence, New York. She was sold in 1882 to the Oregon Improvement Co, Portland, Oregon.

He was a leader in the development of the field of physical anthropology, with an early and lasting interest in dental anthropology. Over his long career he also contributed to osteology, racial studies, genetics, medical anthropology, paleoanthropology, constitutional anthropology, and human engineering. His main interests and his most important contributions were in the areas of child growth and development and forensic anthropology. Wilton Krogman, familiarly known as Bill, was the son of Wilhelm Claus Krogman and Lydia Magdalena Wriedt, who were German immigrants living in Oak Park, Illinois. His parents lacked advanced education, but strongly encouraged him to pursue his studies. His father was a skilled craftsman, described as a perfectionist, who worked with his brothers on the first house by Frank Lloyd Wright. Krogman came in first on a standardized test among 490 applicants to the University of Chicago, which he attended as an undergraduate and post- graduate, gaining his Ph.D. in 1928. There he had his first job, as a lecturer in introductory anthropology. The next year he had a fellowship to the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Starting in 1931 he was an associate professor at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where he interacted with many of the leaders of the profession. In 1939 Krogman wrote an article in the F.B.I. newsletter entitled \\"A Guide to the Identification of Human Skeletal Material\\". It is widely considered to mark the beginning of forensic anthropology in the United States. Over the years Professor Krogman came to be popularly known as \\"the bone doctor\\", examining such famous cases as two boy's skeletons found in the Tower of London. In 1939 he returned to the faculty of the University of Chicago, as associate professor of both anatomy and physical anthropology, teaching graduate students for the first time. Then in 1947 Krogman was called to be professor of physical anthropology in both the Graduate School of Medicine and the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. A package deal gave him an ex officio appointment in the university's Department of Anthropology and as a curator in the university museum. He was also put on the staff of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The multifaceted positions helped him realize his wide-ranging research goals. After becoming professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, he moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to become director of research at the H. K. Cooper Clinic, which worked on cleft palates, finally stepping down from active service there in 1983. Krogman was the author of a number of books. One he liked was The Growth of Man (1941), and one of his most widely known was Child Growth (1972). But without doubt his most famous and influential book was The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine (1962) (updated in 1986), long the definitive work on the topic. He also wrote numerous articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1966. He was first married to Virginia Madge Lane. They had a daughter, Marian Krogman Baur, and a son, William L. Krogman. In 1945, he married Mary Helen Winkley and they had two sons, John Winkley Krogman and Mark Austin Krogman. His definitive biography is by William A. Haviland, a longtime colleague and friend. It was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 1994.

The company was founded in 1972 by Lino Dainese, now a minority stakeholder in the company, expanding through organic growth and acquisitions, including Italian helmet manufacturer AGV (2007). Investcorp bought a majority of the Dainese Group in 2014. The company has been led by CEO Cristiano Silei since 2015 Products Dainese woman's suit Dainese Group helmets are branded AGV, while the suits, jackets, shock-absorbing armor and back protectors, pants, boots, gloves and accessories are branded Dainese. These products are made with materials including traditional cowhide, kangaroo skin, aramid, carbon fiber and titanium, and are sold off-the-rack, made-to-measure, or custom made. In 2017 Dainese added the motorcycling fashion clothing brand Settantadue (\\"seventy- two\\" in Italian). Dainese has diversified its product range over the years to cover mountain biking, skiing and horse riding, often using the technologies developed for motorcycle racing. History Lino Dainese Lino Dainese started the company in 1972 when he was 20, making protective motorcycle apparel in Molvena, Vicenza, Italy. The first article of clothing was a pair of motocross pants. The company has been closely associated with motorcycle racing since its foundation, which has informed its product development, focused on safety, performance and ergonomics. The company acquired the Italian helmet manufacturer AGV in July 2007. The Dainese Group was acquired by Investcorp of Bahrain for ‚Ç¨130 million in 2014. Lino Dainese retained a minority holding and continued as President. Following the Dainese acquisition by Investcorp, Lino Dainese founded D Airlab, a research center for applying D-air technology for non-sports users, such as construction workers and the elderly. The Group's headquarters are in Italy, as are its Research & Development and Design Centers. They have regional office in California, US, and one in Hong Kong. Since its acquisition by Investcorp, the Dainese Group has reported annual revenue growth from ‚Ç¨117 million in 2013 to ‚Ç¨184.7 million in 2017, during which period the number of employees increased from 609 to 757, as of March 2018.  Research  The Dainese Technology Center (D-Tec) develops protection and apparel-related technologies for the group companies and other applications. The company has registered 118 patents. =Dainese D-air= Dainese D-air is an electronically-actuated airbag system developed for motorcyclists. Development began in 1995 and the first working prototype was tested on a race track in 2000. Dainese D-air activated for the first time in an official race when the Italian rider Simone Grotkyj crashed during a 2007 MotoGP practice session at the Valencia circuit. The first Dainese D-air system launched on the market was the racing version in 2011. In 2015, Dainese began selling the Misano 1000, the first standalone jacket for road use incorporating its Dainese D-air Street system, and a version for skiing. There have been significant legal proceedings - widely reported in the press - between Alpinestars and Dainese regarding aspects of their competing motorcycle airbags. =Aerospace= D-Tec hired MIT professor and former NASA Deputy Administrator Dana Newman and space architect Guillermo Trotti to develop the BioSuit, a space suit that uses lines-of-non-extension on the human body to improve freedom of movement for astronauts during extravehicular activities while maintaining constant pressure. In September 2015, European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen was the first to test the Dainese SkinSuit in space during his iriss mission to the International Space Station (ISS). This skin-tight garment is designed to be worn inside the ISS, providing head-to-foot loading to counter the lack of gravity and reduce the risk of post-flight injuries to the spinal intervertebral discs. The SkinSuit was worn on the ISS a second time in November 2016, by the French astronaut Thomas Pesquet during the Proxima Mission. =Worker safety garments= In 2017, working in partnership with the Italian multinational energy company ENEL and occupational health professors and doctors at Bologna University and Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, D Airlab developed the Safety Jacket, an airbag system for protecting workers at risk of accidents from impacts or falling when working at height. =Emirates Team New Zealand= In 2017, Dainese collaborated with Emirates Team New Zealand crew members to design Sea-Guard, the first safety garment developed for yacht races to integrate impact protection and flotation tasks in a single solution. =Dainese Advanced Research Program= Dainese has been working with the Trauma Team at the Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, since 2013 as part of its Dainese Advanced Research Program, which analyzes the effects of motorbike accidents on the human body to improve the design of protective equipment and general rider safety. Design awards Dainese has employed designers including Yohji Yamamoto, Adriano Goldschmied, Marc Sadler, Renato Montagner, and Aldo Drudi. The company has won the following design awards. 2001 T-Age suit - ADI Compasso d'Oro International Award 2017 Mugello R suit - RedDot Design Award 2017 Mugello R suit - Good Design Award 2017 Mugello R suit - International Design Excellence Award 2017 Pro Armor protector - RedDot Design Award 2017 Pro Armor protector - Good Design Award 2017 Pro Armor protector - ADI Compasso d'Oro International Award 2018 AWA M1 ski jacket - Red Dot Design Award 2018 AWA M1 ski jacket - Good Design Award 2018 Pro Armor protector - ISPO Award 2018 HP1 RC ski jacket - ISPO Award Dainese is a member of Altagamma a trade group of Italian automotive, fashion, recreation, travel, and design companies formed 1992 to advertise and promote high end luxury goods. =Dainese Archivio= The Dainese Archivio (DAR) is a permanent multimedia exhibition in Vicenza opposite the Dainese Headquarters which presents the ideas, people and projects that marked the company's advancements in the fields of safety, sport performance, and design.

Most of his paintings were of the West Penwith peninsula and Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. During the 1970s John Miller emerged as a cultural figurehead within Cornwall. He became well known as a painter of popular, Monet-like Cornish scenes (many of which were cheaply reproduced as prints for the tourist trade), as an art teacher, a television personality, a patron of local charities and an active supporter of the Church of England. He was also responsible for some high-profile architectural projects including a reordering of the interior of Newlyn Art Gallery. At an advanced stage in his career John Miller‚Äôs artistic style underwent a radical change and by the mid-1990s his work (but not always his name) had become known worldwide as a result of the mass production and distribution of cheap posters, prints and cards with reproductions of his distinctive beach paintings: he produced the first of these in what was to become recognised as his trademark style in 1992. The beach scenes had enormous market appeal and have become firmly established as iconic images which - now much imitated - apparently spawned a genre. The paintings themselves, which Miller continued to produce in large numbers until his death in 2002, became highly sought after and were only available through selected London galleries at successive annual exhibitions which usually sold out well before their official opening dates. John Miller was elected to become a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists in 1961. John Miller, a household name in Cornwall since the mid-1970s, is an artist whose work continues to have an extremely high public profile, both in the UK and internationally. In a 2003 survey (for the periodical 'Art Business Today') of 200 United Kingdom high street gallery owners whose businesses specialised in posters and popular art reproductions, Miller was listed alongside Monet and L.S. Lowry among the ‚Äòtop-four‚Äô best-selling landscape artists and fifth - above Van Gogh (7th), Picasso (8th), and Matisse (10th) - in a list of the current ‚Äòtop-ten‚Äô best-selling deceased artists in all genres. John Miller‚Äôs work is currently (2004-5) the subject of academic investigation by a postgraduate student at the University of Kent, Canterbury, England.

Early life Hunt's parents are Rosie Lee Vickers and Frank Milligan. Her father was a one-man band, and her grandmother, Louella Reed, was a singer on the Chitlin Circuit. In 1947 her family relocated to Chicago. While growing up on Chicago's south side Hunt discovered her musical talent. Living in that part of Chicago was not easy; recalls Geraldine. \\"On the weekends, we had to sleep on the floor, gangs were shooting through the house; I had been beaten up at gunpoint once, It was rough. We were living below middle class.\\"Disco Museum Despite the bleak living conditions of her childhood, there were bright spots also. A notable time in her life was her years at Hyde Park High School. Her classmate and best friend at school was the late American soul singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Besides Hunt and Riperton, the school also produced a girl group called Coffee who covered Ruby Andrews' \\"Casanova\\" in 1980.  Career  Hunt began her recording career as a teenager with several singles released from 1962: she had her first glimmer of success in 1970 when \\"You & I\\" a duet with Charlie Hodges reached No. 45 on the R&B; chart in Billboard and in 1972 Hunt's remake of \\"Baby I Need Your Loving\\" reached No. 47 R&B.; In 1975 Hunt relocated to Montreal, Quebec where she recorded her first album in 1978, the disco-oriented Sweet Honesty. In 1980 Hunt's second album No Way yielded the track \\"Can't Fake the Feeling\\" which reached No. 1 on the club chart in Billboard where it spent a total of seven weeks: with Top 40 radio then being disco-resistant \\"Can't Fake the Feeling\\" had little mainstream success reaching No. 58 R&B.; However the track did afford Hunt a hit in France at No. 10 and charted in the UK at No. 44.

The plot concerns a gay man named David who leaves a monastery to become a public school teacher by day, while looking for true love in a gay bar by night. One of the first films about gay relationships intended for mainstream, commercial distribution, its original title was For as Long as Possible. It was released to lukewarm reviews in 1973 and given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. Plot The film begins as a mini- documentary of New York City's 1973 Gay Pride parade and rally, with a young lesbian unabashedly declaring, \\"being gay is a very natural thing.\\" The action cuts to the protagonist, David (Robert Joel), going through the ritual of being released from his vocation as a monk in a monastery. He then is seen as a public school teacher of English Literature in the New York City area, who spends his time off driving into the city to be with his \\"oldest friend from Schenectady,\\" Alan (Jay Pierce) at a gay bar. One evening at the bar, David is singled out to dance by Mark (Curt Gareth), who portrays a businessman. They end up spending the night together, which at first seems like a one-night stand until David says he'd like to see Mark again, and Mark agrees. Not long after, the pair begin a monogamous relationship, and David moves in with Mark. But when Mark wants to have sex with other men, the relationship starts to break down. He rejects the idea of modeling a gay relationship on heterosexual marriage, and he is irritated that David wants to \\"keep pushing this romantic thing.\\" Mark would rather have an understanding that either of them can have sex with other men when they feel like it, but this ends up alienating them from each other. Mark refuses to say, \\"I love you\\" until David playfully wrestles with him and tells him, \\"Say it...again...once more for good measure.\\" After a year, though, David realizes that the two of them are just marking time. The two go to Fire Island for a weekend in an attempt to spice up their relationship, and although David tries to please Mark by entering an orgy, he can't go through with it. After a fight, David temporarily moves in with his friend Alan, who gives David an objective perspective on what happened. In a later encounter with Mark at Coney Island, David finally realizes that there can't be a reconciliation, as Mark is more interested in sex than a romantic relationship. After a season of loneliness, David meets a divorced photographer named Jason (Bo White) at the 1973 Gay Pride rally which began the film. David and Jason go to Jason's apartment and talk. In Jason, a divorced dad, we meet another member of the gay community, one who was living a heterosexual life prior to coming out. He still socializes with his ex-wife, who goes with him on photo shoots. On a parental visit with their toddler son (P.J.) Jason tells his ex-wife that he is now seeing someone with whom he would be spending the upcoming Labor Day holiday. It appears that in Jason, David has found someone willing to pursue a romantic, committed relationship with him. Jason takes pictures of David while telling him things to say other than \\"cheese', and the film ends by showing the two men together splashing naked in the surf on Cape Cod. Cast * Robert Joel as David * Curt Gareth as Mark * Bo White as Jason * Anthony McKay as Gary, David's roommate * Marilyn Meyers as Valerie, Gary's fianc√©e * Jay Pierce as Alan, David's friend * Barnaby Rudge as Langley * A.

Both films argued for an unconventional alternative to traditional marriage, despite a commitment. David tells Jason that he is committed to him, but that this commitment is based on wanting to be together, not having to be together. The ending is very optimistic, which was out of the ordinary for gay relationship films until then. Earlier films were dominated by tales of gays and lesbians being outcasts of society, mentally disturbed or committing suicide; later films were sadly dominated by the emergence of AIDS. A Very Natural Thing thus represents a short period in time where gay liberation flourished, and filmmakers could explore relationships in much the same way that films with heterosexual characters did. The film was one of the first mainstream films to show homosexuality as a valid and normal act of love, i.e. \\"a very natural thing,\\" as it attempted to explore the options for gay couples in 1973, including footage of an actual Gay Pride celebration. Many heterosexual film critics felt that the film's depiction of love between two men as romantic made the film automatically \\"an argument rather than an entertainment\\" (The New York Post). The film showed a young gay couple going through many of the same rituals and facing many of the same challenges as a straight couple. Some gay film critics felt that film was not political enough: that the characters were too apolitical, too middle class and that, by rejecting the philosophy of free love or sexual liberation, the film was rejecting what some gay activists felt was a necessary value of the new gay liberation movement. Larkin responded to the criticism by saying, \\"I wanted to say that same-sex relationships are no more problematic but no easier than any other human relationships. They are in many ways the same and in several ways different from heterosexual relationships but in themselves are no less possible or worthwhile\\". Incidentally, Vito Russo, who wrote The Celluloid Closet appears in A Very Natural Thing. The film was not financially successful, and the director, Christopher Larkin, moved to California, where in 1981 he published the book The Divine Androgyne According to Purusha. Larkin committed suicide on June 21, 1988. Availability The film was released in VHS in 1996, it has recently been released on DVD: a 25th Anniversary edition in 1999 by Waterbearer Films, Inc.

He is played by British stage and film actor Ernest Thesiger. Some sources claim he was originally to have been played by Bela Lugosi or Claude Rains. Others indicate that the part was conceived specifically for Thesiger. Character overview Doctor Pretorius is a renegade mad scientist who persuades Henry Frankenstein to resume his experiments with bringing dead flesh to life. An amoral egomaniac, he has no regard for human life or ethics and cares only for his own prestige as a scientist. Along with his sinister qualities, Pretorius is responsible for a large share of the film's dark humor. He eats a picnic dinner in a crypt, trades prissy banter with the Monster, and laments that the tiny ballerina he created \\"will only dance to Mendelssohn's 'Spring Song.'\\" He claims that gin is his only weakness. Then later in the film, he claims his cigars are his only weakness when he first meets the Monster. Pretorius also delivers the famous toast \\"To a new world of gods and monsters!\\" midway through the film. In the film Frankenstein's former teacher Septimus Pretorius is a tall, emaciated-looking man with an unusually large nose and devilish pointed ears. A professor of philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt, Pretorius first points young Henry on the path toward his unwholesome experiments in giving life to the dead. He himself is \\"booted out\\" from his teaching post \\"for knowing too much.\\" Pretorius seeks out his former student after learning that the Monster has survived being trapped in the burning windmill in the climax of the first film. Pretorius himself acknowledges that he may be insane in a conversation with Frankenstein by quoting \\"You think I'm mad? Perhaps I am!\\" Pretorius performs experiments creating life similar to Henry's. He unveils to Henry a group of various homunculi‚Äîminiature living humans which he has kept in bottles and claims to have grown from \\"seed\\" like cultures. Each figure represents a different character: * A Queen which he claims was his first experiment. * A King which is madly in love with the Queen and has a resemblance to Henry VIII. Pretorius has to be very careful with the King and work to keep the King and Queen separated. This is even shown when the King briefly breaks out of his bottle only to be caught by Pretorius and put back in his bottle with his cup on top of the bottle. * An Archbishop which disapproves of what the King is doing to win the Queen's heart. * The Devil who is depicted as a man in a black suit and a cape. Pretorious gleefully compares his own visage to that of the Devil by quoting \\"There's a certain resemblance to me, don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?\\" He says sometimes, he thinks life would be more interesting if they were all devils. * A Ballerina dancer who will only dance to Felix Mendelssohn's \\"Spring Song\\". * A Mermaid grown from \\"an experiment with seaweed\\" which lives in water-filled bottle. He has been unsuccessful in creating a full-sized human. He proposes to Henry that together they create a mate for his monster with Henry building the body and Pretorius supplying an artificially-grown brain. Henry initially balks at the idea, but Pretorius reminds him that he is capable of exposing him to the authorities as the creator of the Monster who has done so much damage. Later, he meets the Monster in a crypt where he has gone to steal bodies and is dining using the top of a coffin as a picnic table. When the Monster asks him \\"Friend?,\\" he gives him the remains of his chicken. He tells the Monster of his plans to create a mate for him. The Monster, eager for companionship of any kind, considers Pretorius his friend. From then on, the Monster is willing to do anything that the impish scientist desires such as kidnapping Henry's wife Elizabeth in order to force him to help Pretorius. Henry agrees and together the two scientists create the Bride of Frankenstein. Unfortunately, even the Bride finds her would-be husband repulsive and the heartbroken Monster decides to end his life by blowing up the laboratory. He instructs Henry and Elizabeth to run, but barks at Pretorius and the Bride to stay saying that they \\"belong dead\\". Before Pretorius can move, the Monster blows up the laboratory and the castle, killing Praetorius, the Bride, and himself. Psychosexual aspects of the character Dr. Pretorius is frequently identified as homosexual, or as near to homosexual as could be presented on- screen in 1935. (There is, of course, no direct reference to homosexuality in the film.) Bride of Frankenstein director James Whale was openly gay and frequently included camp elements in his films. He directed Thesiger (himself identified in some sources as more or less openly gay) to play the part as an \\"over the top caricature of a bitchy and aging homosexual\\". Gay film historian Vito Russo stops short of identifying Pretorius as gay, calling him instead \\"sissified\\" (\\"sissy\\" itself being Hollywood code for \\"homosexual\\"). Pretorius serves as a figure of seduction and temptation, pulling Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of non- procreative life. The Breen Office, responsible for enforcing Hollywood's Production Code, let Pretorius' behavior pass unchallenged. A novelisation of the film published in England made the implication even more clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein, \\"'Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way.\\"Egremont, Michael, quoted in Skal p. 189 Other appearances Pretorius appears in The Mask: Animated Series as the primary and recurring antagonist of the series' titular character, Stanley Ipkiss / The Mask, depicted as a mad scientist who had his own head removed from his body and placed on tiny, spider-like robotic legs, which could attach to a larger android body. Pretorius appears in Kim Newman's crossover novel Dracula Cha Cha Cha, as a colleague of H. P. Lovecraft's Herbert West. He appears as one of the horror movie spoofs in Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter and also appears in Allan Rune Pettersson's novel Frankenstein's Aunt Returns. In the Amicus horror film The House That Dripped Blood (1970), Geoffrey Bayldon, playing a mysterious antique shop owner, is made up and costumed to look like Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius. In the 1973 NBC-TV miniseries Frankenstein: The True Story, James Mason portrays a Pretorius-like figure named Dr. Polidori (named for Lord Byron's real-life physician, John William Polidori, who was part of the 1816 gathering that produced Mary Shelley's novel and also the author of the story \\"The Vampyre\\"). Mason's Dr. Polidori enlists Victor to assist in creating the female creature Prima (portrayed by Jane Seymour). The 1986 film From Beyond adds a Dr. Edward Pretorius at Miskatonic University (played by Ted Sorel) as a dark mentor for Crawford Tillinghast (Jeffrey Combs). This Pretorius is an impotent sadist (with a room full of bondage gear) who is assimilated by \\"the Beyond\\" and attempts to drag others into it, boasting that the pineal gland growth brought on by the resonator is like \\"an orgasm of the mind\\". The 1989 Akif Pirin√ßci novel Felidae and its 1994 animated feature film adaptation feature an insane Professor Preterius in the backstory performing increasingly dark experiments on the cat Claudandus. In the 1998 independent film Gods and Monsters, directed by Bill Condon, Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius is played by Arthur Dignam in a flashback about the filming of Bride of Frankenstein. An earlier scene shows Whale's gardener Clayton Boon (portrayed by Brendan Fraser) watching Bride of Frankenstein on television, specifically the climatic scene of Pretorius and Frankenstein unveiling the Bride. In the 2007 Frankenstein TV movie, the character of Professor Jane Pretorius is based on Septimus Pretorius and served as Victoria Frankenstein's boss. In the Dark Horse \\"Universal's Monsters\\" novel, The Bride Of Frankenstein: Pandora's Bride, Pretorius somehow survives the destruction of the tower lab along with the Bride. They escape to Germany where he teaches her to become her own woman. In Mary Shelley's Frankenhole, the character Professor Sanguinaire Polidori (voiced by Scott Adsit) is based on Septimus Pretorius.

The film, which was written and directed by Richard Stanley (in his feature directorial debut), also features cameos from Carl McCoy, Iggy Pop and Lemmy. Since its release, it has become a cult film. The film is about a self-repairing robot that goes on a rampage in a post- apocalyptic slum. Fleetway Comics successfully sued the film-makers over the screenplay because it plagiarised a short story entitled SHOK! that appeared in 1980 in the Judge Dredd Annual 1981, a spin-off publication of the popular British weekly anthology comic 2000 AD.  Plot  A nomad scavenger treks through an irradiated wasteland and discovers a buried robot. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy, who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter, a former soldier, and Mo's friend Shades. When Alvy steps away, Mo buys the robot parts from the nomad and sells all but the head to Alvy. Intrigued by the technology, Alvy begins to research its background. Mo and Shades visit Jill, Mo's reclusive girlfriend, and, after an initially distant welcome where Jill checks them with a Geiger counter, Mo presents the robot head as a Christmas gift. Jill, a metal sculptor, eagerly accepts the head. After Shades leaves, they have sex, while being unknowingly watched by their foul-mouthed, perverted, voyeuristic neighbour Lincoln Weinberg via telescope. Later, Mo and Jill argue about a government sterilization plan and the morality of having children. Jill works the robot head into a sculpture, and Mo says that he likes the work, but he does not understand what it represents. Frustrated, Jill says it represents nothing and resents Mo's suggestion that she make more commercial art to sell. They are interrupted by Alvy, who urges Mo to return to the shop, as he has important news about the robot, which he says is a M.A.R.K. 13. Before he leaves, Mo checks his Bible, where he finds the phrase \\"No flesh shall be spared\\" under Mark 13:20, and he becomes suspicious that the robot is part of a government plot for human genocide to address the planet's severe overpopulation crisis. Mo finds Alvy dead of a cytotoxin and evidence that the robot is an experimental combat model capable of self-repair; Alvy's notes also indicate a defect, a weakness to humidity. Worried, Mo contacts Shades and asks him to check on Jill, but Shades is in the middle of a drug trip and barely coherent. Back at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures and recharged by draining her apartment's power network. It attempts to kill Jill, but she traps it in a room after the apartment's doors lock. Lincoln sees the robot close the blinds while trying to peep on Jill, and, after he briefly manages to open the apartment door, makes crude sexual advances towards her, and offers to override the emergency lock that traps them in her apartment. Lincoln dismisses her warnings of a killer robot, and, when he attempts to open Jill's blinds so that he can more easily peep on her, the M.A.R.K. 13 brutally kills him. Jill flees into her kitchen, where she reasons that her refrigerator will hide her from the robot's infrared vision. She damages the robot before Mo, Shades, and the apartment's security team arrive and open fire on it, apparently destroying it. As Jill and Mo embrace, the M.A.R.K. 13 drags her out a window, and she crashes into her neighbour's apartment. Jill races back upstairs to help Mo, who is alone with the M.A.R.K. 13. Overconfident, Mo engages the robot in battle, and it injects him with the same toxin that killed Alvy. Mo experiences euphoria and a series of hallucinations as he dies. After Jill re-enters her apartment, the M.A.R.K. 13 sets her apartment doors to rapidly open and close; the security team die when they attempt to enter, and Shades is trapped outside. Jill hacks into the M.A.R.K. 13's CPU and unsuccessfully attempts to communicate with it; however, she discovers the robot's weakness and lures the M.A.R.K. 13 into the bathroom. Shades, who has managed to quickly jump through the doors, gives her time to turn on the shower. The M.A.R.K. 13 short circuits and is finally deactivated. The next morning, a radio broadcast announces that the M.A.R.K. 13 has been approved by the government, and it will be mass manufactured.  Cast  * Dylan McDermott as Moses \\"Hard Mo\\" Baxter * Stacey Travis as Jill * John Lynch as Shades * Iggy Pop as Angry Bob * Carl McCoy as Nomad * William Hootkins as Lincoln Wineberg, Jr. * Mark Northover as Alvy * Paul McKenzie as Vernon * Lemmy as Water Taxi Driver  Production  The film's script was similar to a short 2000 AD comic strip called \\"SHOK!\\" which had been published in 1980. Fleetway Comics brought a successful lawsuit that the film plagiarized the comic strip and so a notice was added to later releases, giving credits to the strip's publisher, Fleetway Publications and creators, Steve MacManus and Kevin O'Neill. Other influences include Soylent Green, Damnation Alley, and the works of Philip K. Dick. Writer-director Richard Stanley had previously made a post-apocalyptic short film when he was a teenager, and Hardware grew out of that film and responses he got from other, unproduced scripts. By the late 1980s, Stanley had joined a guerrilla Muslim faction in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in order to shoot a documentary. He started pre-production of Hardware almost immediately after leaving Afghanistan. The opening scene was shot in Morocco, and the rest of the film was shot in east London. The film was originally more specifically British, but Miramax insisted on American leads. Stanley then added a multinational cast to muddy the setting. Stanley wanted to emphasize themes of fascism and passive acceptance of authoritarianism, as he had recently come from the apartheid regime of South Africa. Stanley says that the robot does not know that it is committing evil, and it only obeys its programming, which could be likened to a spiritual quest. Psychic TV was an inspiration for the exaggerated television broadcasts.  Release  Hardware was originally rated \\"X\\" by the MPAA for its gore. It was later cut to avoid the stigma of a rating associated with pornography. In the United States, the film debuted at number six. It grossed $2,381,285 in its opening weekend and had a total domestic gross of $5,728,953 in 695 theaters. Home media Due to its unexpected success, the film was caught up in continual legal issues that prevented its release on DVD for many years. Hardware was released on Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 22 June 2009. It was released on Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 13 October 2009 by Severin Films.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes shows that the film received positive reviews from 50% of 12 surveyed critics; the average rating was 5.7/10. On its original release, Hardware received mixed reviews from critics, who cited it as derivative of Alien and The Terminator. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated the film D+ and called it unoriginal, \\"as if someone had remade Alien with the monster played by a rusty erector set.\\" Variety wrote, \\"A cacophonic, nightmarish variation on the postapocalyptic cautionary genre, Hardware has the makings of a punk cult film.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times called it a shallow splatter film whose exaggerated bleakness elevates it above the typical techno-thriller. Hardware has the \\"inherent blemishes of the techno-thriller genre\\", its bringing life in post-industrialism to the level of drones, and exaggerated high-tech bloodbaths. Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as a future midnight movie and wrote, \\"Watching Hardware is like being trapped inside a video game that talks dirty.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post called it \\"an MTV movie, a mad rush of hyperkinetic style and futuristic imagery with little concern for plot (much less substance).\\" Despite mixed reviews during original release, Hardware managed to become a cult film. Ian Berriman of SFX wrote, \\"It's one of those lovingly crafted movies where ingenuity and enthusiasm overcome the budgetary limitations.\\" Matt Serafini of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Hardware isn't quite the masterpiece that some its most ardent fans have claimed, but it's an excellent piece of low-budget filmmaking from an era when low-budget wasn't synonymous with camcorder crap.\\" Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"an austere and trippy film\\" with a narrative that is \\"a disjointed mess\\"; however, the film's excesses make it a cult film. Todd Brown of Twitch Film called it \\"essentially a lower budget, more intentionally punk take on The Terminator\\" that has an \\"undeniable ... sense of style\\". At DVD Verdict, Daryl Loomis called it slow- paced but stylistic and atmospheric, and Gordon Sullivan called it \\"a hallucinatory and violent film\\" that has an overly detailed, slow-paced beginning. Writing for DVD Talk, Kurt Dahlke rated it 3/5 stars and called it a \\"forgotten gem\\" that \\"is overwhelmed by style and gore\\", and Brian Orndorf called it \\"an art-house, sci-fi gorefest\\" that is moody and atmospheric without buckling under its own weight. Michael Gingold of Fangoria rated it 3/4 stars and wrote, \\"If the ingredients of HARDWARE are familiar, Stanley cooks them to a boil with a relentless pace and imagery that makes his future a tactile place\\".

Although the specifics of the stance vary by style, overall it is visually similar to a lunge, with the forward leg bent at the knee, and the rear leg straight, while the hips and shoulders remain squarely facing forward. The purpose of the stance is to teach musculo-skeletal alignment that adds as much mass of the earth to a strike as possible. The stance allows a great deal of power generation forward, but very little in any other direction. Japanese martial arts Karate students training in front stance at Shuri Castle, c.1938 In Japanese martial arts, the is primarily practiced in karate and its variants. Some variations include the version practiced by Shotokan, where students generally place their feet at a longer depth, while Isshin-ry≈´ students place their feet shoulder width, but with much shallower length. Other variations are also practiced. The purpose of the front stance is to provide stability while projecting the body weight forwards, such as when punching. The straight rear leg pushes the center of gravity forwards, ensuring the full body weight is behind the strike, while the bent front leg supports the body weight. The front stance can be used when moving forwards or backwards, as long as the body weight or center of gravity is projected forwards. The back stance is by contrast used when the body weight or center of gravity is positioned on the rear leg, such as when leaning backwards to avoid an attack. Korean martial arts The front stance is primarily practiced by students of taekwondo, where it is called ap kubi. Students of Tang Soo Do or Kong Soo Do call this stance chun gul chase. Depending on the school's lineage, it will either be very similar to a Shotokan deep and long stance (Most Moo Duk Kwan or Chung Do Kwan lineage schools), or else appear more similar to a Shudokan or Renbukai stance, which is of shorter length (Most Jido Kwan, Han Moo Kwan or Chang Moo Kwan schools).

Edward Damer that has been used for many years in a number of college courses on logic, critical thinking, argumentation, and philosophy. It explains 60 of the most commonly committed fallacies. Each of the fallacies is concisely defined and illustrated with several relevant examples. For each fallacy, the text gives suggestions about how to address or to \\"attack\\" the fallacy when it is encountered. The organization of the fallacies comes from the author‚Äôs own fallacy theory, which defines a fallacy as a violation of one of the five criteria of a good argument: * the argument must be structurally well-formed; * the premises must be relevant; * the premises must be acceptable; * the premises must be sufficient in number, weight, and kind; * there must be an effective rebuttal of challenges to the argument. Each fallacy falls into at least one of Damer's five fallacy categories, which derive from the above criteria. The five fallacy categories * Fallacies that violate the structural criterion. The structural criterion requires that one who argues for or against a position should use an argument that meets the fundamental structural requirements of a well-formed argument, using premises that are compatible with one another, that do not contradict the conclusion, that do not assume the truth of the conclusion, and that are not involved in any faulty deductive inference. Fallacies such as begging the question, denying the antecedent, or undistributed middle violate this criterion. * Fallacies that violate the relevance criterion. The relevance criterion requires that one who presents an argument for or against a position should attempt to set forth only reasons that are directly related to the merit of the position at issue. Fallacies such as appeal to tradition, appeal to force, or genetic fallacy fail to meet the argumentative demands of relevance. * Fallacies that violate the acceptability criterion. The acceptability criterion requires that one who presents an argument for or against a position should attempt to use reasons that are likely to be accepted by a rationally mature person and that meet the standard criteria of acceptability. Fallacies such as equivocation, fallacy of division, and wishful thinking are unacceptable because they are based on linguistic confusion or involve unacceptable assumptions. * Fallacies that violate the sufficiency criterion. The sufficiency criterion requires that one who presents an argument for or against a position should attempt to provide reasons that are sufficient in number, kind, and weight to support the acceptance of the conclusion. Fallacies such as argument from ignorance, special pleading, and the post hoc fallacy violate this criterion because they are arguments that are missing important evidence or make causal assumptions based on insufficient evidence. * Fallacies that violate the rebuttal criterion. The rebuttal criterion requires that one who presents an argument for or against a position should attempt to provide an effective rebuttal to all serious challenges to the argument or the position it supports and to the strongest arguments for viable alternative positions. Fallacies such as red herring, straw man, and poisoning the well fail to meet this criterion because they attack the arguer rather than the argument or use argumentative devices that divert attention away from the issue at stake. The text also sets forth 12 principles that constitute a \\"Code of Conduct for Effective Discussion.\\" This code incorporates Damer‚Äôs fallacy theory and provides a procedural and ethical standard for the development of an effective intellectual style to be used when engaging in a rational discussion of important issues.

The game was developed by Electronic Arts, Design and Programming led by Brent Iverson, also known for the PC DOS version of Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, and US Navy Fighters. The game was originally released for PC DOS, thereafter ports were made for other platforms, such as the Mega Drive/Genesis. Gameplay In addition to the titular LHX prototype scout- attack helicopter, the game features two flyable US Army helicopters, the AH-64A Apache and UH-60 Blackhawk, and another prototype (as of 1990): the MV-22 Osprey, any of which may be deployed against Soviet-made ground and air military equipment in the three war theaters of Libya, Vietnam and Germany. Allied units are also available, but they do not actively join the fight, nor do the opposing units usually fire upon allied equipment, apart from specific escort missions where a B-2 bomber or a couple of UH-60 tasked with CSAR will enter into enemy air space. All missile-equipped units (both ground and air) have a limited number of shots, often matching the number of ready-to-fire missiles available in the real system. Land units do not move but air units do. The game interface for the LHX aircraft. The player can play any campaign or mission in any preferred order, facing five different complexity levels, which will improve the enemy's situation awareness, time of reaction and sheer number and quality of the fielded forces. Every completed mission will not affect the other missions or the campaign as a whole and the player can run the same mission again regardless its previous result. At the end of every mission, the player receives a mission debriefing describing the consequences of the success or failure and a point counter will change depending whether the primary target is completed, whether the pilot landed at an allied airfield and not just in friendly territory and to a smaller extent the number of other enemy forces destroyed in the process of reaching and returning from the target area. At the debriefing, given the mission outcome, the pilot may receive different medals or a promotion up to Colonel rank. In case the player's helicopter exploded mid-air or crashed, the pilot will die and the player career will end. If landing in enemy territory, different outcomes are available, with the pilot being captured or killed or escaped to friendly territory or rescued by friendly forces. Reception A 1992 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game two and a half stars out of five, stating that it had a \\"highly unrealistic flight model\\". A 1994 survey gave it two stars, stating that \\"it enjoyed more popular success than I thought it deserved\\". In 1994, PC Gamer US named LHX Attack Chopper the 29th best computer game ever.

It is currently in the south of Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, but until 1974 was part of Gelligaer Urban District Council in the county of Glamorgan. Description Bedlinog School Bedlinog War Memorial It has a population of around 1,400 people. The combined population of Bedlinog and Trelewis has been recently recorded as approximately 3,140, increasing to 3,277 at the 2011 census. Name Bedlinog is the name of the village in both English and Welsh. The meaning of the name is somewhat unclear, but the usual suggestion is that it means the 'house near (the stream) Llwynog'. If so, the first element is a variant of the Welsh 'bod' ('dwelling'), and the second a variant of the name of a stream ('Llwynog') which literally means 'fox'. However, all forms of the name are relatively late (seventeenth century onwards) and show significant variation. During the nineteenth century the name was thought by some to have been formed from the elements 'bedd' ('grave') and 'llwynog' ('fox'), and the form 'Beddllwynog' ('fox's grave') is used by some Welsh speakers today. But it is not the standard Welsh form, and it is clear that 'Bedlinog' was the predominant form used by the area's Welsh-speakers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.On the name 'Bedlinog', see Hywel Wyn Owen & Richard Morgan. 2007.

In biology, a refugium (plural: refugia) is a location which supports an isolated or relict population of a once more widespread species. This isolation (allopatry) can be due to climatic changes, geography, or human activities such as deforestation and overhunting. Mountain gorilla Present examples of refuge species are the mountain gorilla, isolated to specific mountains in central Africa, and the Australian sea lion, isolated to specific breeding beaches along the south- west coast of Australia, due to humans taking so many of their number as game. This resulting isolation, in many cases, can be seen as only a temporary state; however, some refugia may be longstanding, thereby having many endemic species, not found elsewhere, which survive as relict populations. The Indo- Pacific Warm Pool has been proposed to be a longstanding refugium, based on the discovery of the \\"living fossil\\" of a marine dinoflagellate called Dapsilidinium pastielsii, currently found in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool only. In anthropology, refugia often refers specifically to Last Glacial Maximum refugia, where some ancestral human populations may have been forced back to glacial refugia (similar small isolated pockets on the face of the continental ice sheets) during the last glacial period. Going from west to east, suggested examples include the Franco-Cantabrian region (in northern Iberia), the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, the Ukrainian LGM refuge, and the Bering Land Bridge. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived the glacial maxima (including the Last Glacial Maximum) in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover. More recently, refugia has been used to refer to areas that could offer relative climate stability in the face of modern climate change.  Speciation  As an example of a locale refugia study, J√ºrgen Haffer first proposed the concept of refugia to explain the biological diversity of bird populations in the Amazonian river basin. Haffer suggested that climatic change in the late Pleistocene led to reduced reservoirs of habitable forests in which populations become allopatric. Over time, that led to speciation: populations of the same species that found themselves in different refugia evolved differently, creating parapatric sister-species. As the Pleistocene ended, the arid conditions gave way to the present humid rainforest environment, reconnecting the refugia. Scholars have since expanded the idea of this mode of speciation and used it to explain population patterns in other areas of the world, such as Africa, Eurasia, and North America. Theoretically, current biogeographical patterns can be used to infer past refugia: if several unrelated species follow concurrent range patterns, the area may have been a refugium. Moreover, the current distribution of species with narrow ecological requirements tend to be associated with the spatial position of glacial refugia. Simple environment examples of temperature Two slopes with different sunlight exposure, only one is covered with snow One can provide a simple explanation of refugia involving core temperatures and exposure to sunlight. In the northern hemisphere, north-facing sites on hills or mountains, and places at higher elevations count as cold sites. The reverse are sun- or heat-exposed, lower- elevation, south-facing sites: hot sites. (The opposite directions apply in the southern hemisphere.) Each site becomes a refugium, one as a \\"cold- surviving refugium\\" and the other as a \\"hot-surviving refugium\\". Canyons with deep hidden areas (the opposite of hillsides, mountains, mesas, etc. or other exposed areas) lead to these separate types of refugia. A concept not often referenced is that of \\"sweepstakes colonization\\": when a dramatic ecological event occurs, for example a meteor strike, and global, multiyear effects occur. The sweepstake-winning species happens to already be living in a fortunate site, and their environment is rendered even more advantageous, as opposed to the \\"losing\\" species, which immediately fails to reproduce.  Climate change refugia  In systematic conservation planning, the term refugium has been used to define areas that could be used in protected area development to protect species from climate change. The term has been used alternatively to refer to areas with stable habitats or stable climates. More specifically, the term in situ refugium is used to refer to areas that will allow species that exist in an area to remain there even as conditions change, whereas ex situ refugium refers to an area into which species distributions can move to in response to climate change. Sites that offer in situ refugia are also called resilient sites in which species will continue to have what they need to survive even as climate changes. One study found with downscaled climate models that areas near the coast are predicted to experience overall less warming than areas toward the interior of the US State of Washington. Other research has found that old-growth forests are particularly insulated from climatic changes due to evaporative cooling effects from evapotranspiration and their ability to retain moisture. The same study found that such effects in the Pacific Northwest would create important refugia for bird species. A review of refugia-focused conservation strategy in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion found that, in addition to old-growth forest, the northern aspects of hillslopes and deep gorges would provide relatively cool areas for wildlife and seeps or bogs surrounded by mature and old-growth forests would continue to supply moisture even as water availability decreases. The Lake Pedder area had high geodiversity before it was flooded Beginning in 2010 the concept of geodiversity (a term used previously in efforts to preserve scientifically important geological features) entered into the literature of conservation biologists as a potential way to identify climate change refugia and as a surrogate (in other words, a proxy used when planning for protected areas) for biodiversity. While the language to describe this mode of conservation planning hadn't fully developed until recently, the use of geophysical diversity in conservation planning goes back at least as far as the work by Hunter and others in 1988, and Richard Cowling and his colleagues in South Africa also used \\"spatial features\\" as surrogates for ecological processes in establishing conservation areas in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The most recent efforts have used the idea of land facets (also referred to as geophysical settings, enduring features, or geophysical stages), which are unique combinations of topographical features (such as slope steepness, slope direction, and elevation) and soil composition, to quantify physical features. The density of these facets, in turn, is used as a measure of geodiversity. Because geodiversity has been shown to be correlated with biodiversity, even as species move in response to climate change, protected areas with high geodiversity may continue to protect biodiversity as niches get filled by the influx of species from neighboring areas. Highly geodiverse protected areas may also allow for the movement of species within the area from one land facet or elevation to another. Conservation scientists, however, emphasize that the use of refugia to plan for climate change is not a substitute for fine-scale (more localized) and traditional approaches to conservation, as individual species and ecosystems will need to be protected where they exist in the present. They also emphasize that responding to climate change in conservation is not a substitute for actually limiting the causes of climate change.

His sculptures are typically placed in the eye of a needle or on the head of a pin. A single sculpture can be as small as 0.005 mm (0.0002 in). Life and work As a child with dyslexia and Asperger syndrome, neither of which were diagnosed until adulthood, Willard Wigan was ridiculed in class by his primary school teachers for not learning to read. Wigan attributes his early drive in sculpting, which began at the age of five, to his need to escape from the derision of teachers and classmates. He wanted to show the world that nothing did not exist, deducing that if people were unable to view his work, then they would not be in any position to criticise it. Wigan has since aimed to make even smaller artworks, visible only with a microscope. In July 2007 he was made an MBE.\\"The tiny world of Willard Wigan, nano sculptor\\", Telegraph.co.uk, 7 July 2007, accessed 23 July 2007 On 3 February 2016 Wigan was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Midweek programme. In January 2018 Willard Wigan received an honorary doctorate from the University of Warwick in recognition of the significant contributions that he has made to art and sculpture. Exhibitions and American tour In 2004, Wigan exhibited at The Artlounge gallery in Birmingham. The BBC's Inside Out - South West noted that the works displayed included \\"scenes of Jesus Christ and The Last Supper, with each individual figure no bigger than an eyelash or a human hair.

In 2010, the BBC reported that Wigan had sculpted a model of St Bartholomew's church in Chosen Hill, Gloucestershire on a grain of sand that he had taken from its churchyard. He had done so in response to a challenge from his girlfriend, who described the result as \\"absolutely fantastic\\". The vicar of the church said the sculpture was beautiful, but Wigan expressed his own dissatisfaction with the work, saying \\"As small as what you've seen, it's not the best of me yet, I'm taking it even smaller because I'm not satisfied with my work right now, it's too big.\\" References External links * *Willard Wigan  Profile on TED.com *BBC Birmingham biography *Snopes page with images Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:English sculptors Category:English male sculptors Category:20th-century British sculptors Category:21st-century sculptors Category:Microminiature sculptors Category:Black English people Category:Black British artists Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:English people of Jamaican descent Category:People with Asperger syndrome Category:People with dyslexia Category:Artists with autism ","title":"Willard Wigan"},{"id":"2175129","text":"Tom Pazik (1940-1993) began his dance training in Detroit, Michigan where he studied under Sandra Severo.

It is located in the ancient city of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the holy river KShipra. The presiding deity, Lord Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be Swayambhu, deriving currents of power (Shakti) from within itself as against the other images and lingams that are ritually established and invested with mantra-shakti. On 5 September 2019, A show premiered on History TV18 Mahakaleshwar : The Legends of Shiva showed about the working in Mahakaleshwar Mandir during the Shivaratri. Mahakaal As per the Shiva Purana, Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu once had an argument over who was supreme in the creation.R. 2003, pp. 92-95 To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma decide to travel along the pillar downwards and upwards respectively, to find the end of the light. Brahma lied that he had found the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears.

This is a unique feature, upheld by the tantric shivnetra tradition to be found only in Mahakaleshwar among the 12 Jyotirlingas. The idol of Omkareshwar Mahadev is consecrated in the sanctum above the Mahakal shrine. The images of Ganesh, Parvati and Karttikeya are installed in the west, north, and east of the sanctum sanctorum. To the south is the image of Nandi, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. The idol of Nagchandreshwar on the third storey is open for darshan only on the day of Nag Panchami. The temple has five levels, one of which is underground. The temple itself is located in a spacious courtyard surrounded by massive walls near a lake. The shikhar or the spire is adorned with sculptural finery. Brass lamps light the way to the underground sanctum. It is believed that prasada (holy offering) offered here to the deity can be re-offered unlike all other shrines.Mahakaleshwar temple web-page The presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternally in the city of Ujjain. The temple of Mahakaleshwar, its shikhar soaring into the sky, an imposing fa√ßade against the skyline, evokes primordial awe and reverence with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link with ancient Hindu traditions. On the day of Maha Shivaratri, a huge fair is held near the temple, and worship goes on through the night. Devotees are not allowed to bring bags , mobile phones and cameras during the visit . Lockers and Cloak Rooms are there for devotees where they can keep their belongings.

References in Hindu scriptures According to the Puranas, the city of Ujjain was called Avantika and was famous for its beauty and its status as a devotional epicenter. It was also one of the primary cities where students went to study holy scriptures. According to legend, there was a ruler of Ujjain called Chandrasena, who was a pious devotee of Lord Shiva and worshiped him all the time. One day, a farmer's boy named Shrikhar was walking on the grounds of the palace and heard the King chant the Lord's name and rushed to the temple to start praying with him. However, the guards removed him by force and sent him to the outskirts of the city near the river Kshipra. Rivals of Ujjain, primarily King Ripudamana and King Singhaditya of the neighboring kingdoms decided to attack the Kingdom and take over its treasures around this time. Hearing this, Shrikhar started to pray and the news spread to a priest named Vridhi. He was shocked to hear this and upon the urgent pleas of his sons, started to pray to Lord Shiva at the river Kshipra. The Kings chose to attack and were successful; with the help of the powerful demon Dushan, who was blessed by Lord Brahma to be invisible, they plundered the city and attacked all the devotees of Lord Shiva. Upon hearing the pleas of His helpless devotees, Lord Shiva appeared in his Mahakala form and destroyed the enemies of King Chandrasena. Upon the request of his devotees Shrikhar and Vridhi, Lord Shiva agreed to reside in the city and become the chief deity of the Kingdom and take care of it against its enemies and to protect all His devotees. From that day on, Lord Shiva resided in His light form as Mahakala in a Lingam that was formed on its own from the powers of the Lord and His consort, Parvati. The Lord also blessed his devotees and declared that people who worshipped Him in this form would be free from the fear of death and diseases. Also, they would be granted worldly treasures and be under the protection of the Lord himself. Bharthari was the elder son of King Gandharva-Sena, and received the kingdom of Ujjain from the celestial god Indra and the King of Dhara. When Bharthari was king of 'Ujjayani' (modern-day Ujjain) in his state there lived a Brahman who after years of austerities was given the fruit of immortality from the celestial tree of Kalpavriksha. The Brahman presented the same to his monarch, Raja Bharthari, who in turn, passed it on to his love, the beautiful, Pinglah Rani or Ananga Sena Raja Bhartrhari's last and youngest wife. The queen, being in love with the Head police officer of the state, Mahipaala, presented the fruit to him, who further passed it on to his beloved, Lakha, one of the maids of honour. Eventually, Lakha being in love with the king presented the fruit back to the king. Having completed the circle, the fruit revealed the downsides of infidelity to the king, he summoned the queen and ordered her beheading, and ate the fruit himself. After that, he abdicated the throne, and became a religious mendicant. He later became a disciple of Pattinatthar who first indulged in an argument about samsari and sanyasi with king Bhartrhari. Later during the conversation pattinathar said that all women have 'dual mind' and it might be the true case even with Parameswari. King conveyed this news to Rani Pingalah and she ordered Pattinathar to get punished and to sit in kalu maram (tree, whose top portion would be sharpened like a pencil and whole tree is fully coated with oil, a person who is punished to sit in the top will be split into 2 pieces), they tried to kill Pattinathar, but Kalu Maram started burning and nothing happened to Pattinathar, the king came to know this news and went directly to Pattinathar and asked him to get ready to die the next day, but Pattinathar replied, \\" I'm ready right now, to die\\". The next day king came with tears in his eyes and released saint from jail because he actually noticed Queen Pingalah in love with horsemen that night, He threw away his empire, wealth, even full coat dress and dressed in a simple kovanam (loincloth), the king became a disciple of Pattinatthar and got mukthi (salvation) in Kalahasthi temple.Page 67, South Indian Hindu festivals and traditions, By Maithily Jagannathan, Published 2005, Abhinav Publications, Kalidasa (c. 2nd‚Äì1st century BCE), the great Sanskrit poet of the times who was probably a contemporary of king Pushyamitra Sunga, has mentioned about the rituals of the temple in his works in Meghad≈´ta. He mentions about the nada- aradhana, the performance of art and dance during the evening rituals. History The temple complex was destroyed by Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish during his raid of Ujjain in 1234-5. The Jyotirlingam was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby 'Kotiteerth Kunda' (a pond neighboring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion. The present structure was built by the Maratha general Ranoji Shinde in 1734 CE. Further developments and management was done by other members of his dynasty, including Mahadji Shinde (1730‚Äì12 February 1794) and Daulat Rao Shinde's wife Baiza Bai. (1827‚Äì1863). During the reign of Jayajirao Shinde (until 1886), major programs of the then Gwalior State used to be held at this temple. Maratha regime was established in Ujjain in the fourth decade of Eighteenth c. The administration of Ujjain was assigned by Peshwa Bajirao-I to his faithful commander Ranoji Shinde, The Diwan of Ranoji was Sukhatanakar Ramchandra Baba Shenavi who was very wealthy he decided to invest his wealth for religious purposes. In this connection, he re-built the famous Mahakala temple in Ujjain during the 4th-5th decades of Eighteenth c. AD. After Independence the Dev Sthan Trust was replaced by the municipal corporation of Ujjain. Nowadays it is under the collectorate office of Ujjain districrt.

Episodes are available for purchase through digital video outlets and for free streaming on YouTube on the Endemol Beyond channel.

It was similar to Banzai except that it did not emphasize wagering and instead of mocking Japanese culture, it parodied media coverage of major athletic events (especially British coverage). People competed in silly events to see who could become the People's Champion in that event (see the list of events below). Each episode opened with the show's host, Oliver Muirhead, introducing the staff of black with white-striped track-suit wearing judges, including an intense old man Ernie Misko, an intimidating large man of African descent, and a beautiful, sexy model Carolina Rommel. After an introduction by Muirhead, the event would start with a participant stating their desire to be the People's Champion of a certain event. Muirhead would then narrate the setup of the event and introduce the competition while the judges oversaw the competitions. Most events had three individual participants each making an attempt at the event. Events that involved all participants competing simultaneously often had more than three and some events featured a pair of two-person teams squaring off. While the events occur, Muirhead delivered exaggerated, sarcastic commentary. After some post-event interviews, the new People's Champion of the event was awarded. The last event of the show was a viewer-submitted challenge. Several amateur video clips for the contest were shown with the final one being the People's Champion. A recap of all of the day's Champions were shown during the credits at the end of the show.

In the 12th century, this territory of the young Duchy of Brabant was strategically positioned between the County of Flanders and the Berthout family, lords of Grimbergen. Most likely, the first fortification was built by Wouter van Craaynem at the end of the Grimbergen Wars (1150‚Äì1170). Bouchout Castle is situated at an altitude of 32 meters. At about 1300, the Donjon tower of Bouchout Castle was erected by Daniel van Bouchout, a knight who fought gloriously at the Battle of Worringen. In the 15th and 16th century, Bouchout Castle was owned by the Van der Marck and van Sevenbergen sayd Transylvanus families. The castle fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance, while the Spanish dominance and the iconoclastic fury further worsened its condition. The first major renovation was performed by Christoffel d'Assonville at about 1600. The rectangular medieval Bouchout Castle was surrounded by a large pond and could only be reached by a long drawbridge. At the end of the 17th century, Peter-Ferdinand Roose transformed the castle into a Renaissance \\"Chateau de Bouchout\\", surrounded with French ornamental gardens. Unfortunately, the castle was partly destroyed during the French Revolution period (1800‚Äì1830). Again, the castle was restored in 1832 by count Amadeus de Beauffort, who gave Bouchout Castle its current Neo-Gothic appearance. From 1879 until 1927, Empress Charlotte of Mexico lived at the Bouchout Domain. Her husband Emperor Maximilian I was executed by Mexican republicans in 1867. Thereafter Charlotte led a secluded life at Bouchout Castle. Since 1939, the Bouchout Domain has developed into the National Botanic Garden of Belgium. Since the last renovation of 1987‚Äì1989, the castle and its rooms are now being used for meetings, lectures and exhibitions.  Origins  300px During the first part of the 12th century, the territory of Bouchout (alternative spelling Boechout and pronounced as Book-Howt), played an important role in the foundation of the Duchy of Brabant. This Brabant territory was strategically positioned between the County of Flandres and the rebellious knights of Grimbergen. In the centre, the original territory was swampy and mainly consisted of beech trees. It was called \\"Boc-holt\\", which may point towards the origin of the castle's name, Boekhout. During this period, Godfrey I, Duke of Leuven settled peace with the Count of Flandres, so he could focus on establishing a stable Duchy. He experienced however that the Berthouts, lords of Grimbergen, were not loyal to him. The Berthout family owned a mighty castle at Grimbergen and thereby controlled the important trade routes from Bruges to Cologne (Germany). Despite a number attempts, Godfrey I and II did not succeed in defeating the Berthout family (Grimbergen Wars). Godfrey III decided to build two fortifications in the direct vicinity of Berthout Castle. The first one, Nedelaar Castle, was constructed in 1148 directly at the other side of river Zenne. The second one, at the Bouchout Domain, was constructed by Wouter van Craaynem (Kraainem, Crainhem) who received the domain from Godfrey III. At that same period, in 1159, the Brabant troops assisted by Flanders, defeated the Berthout family after twenty years of Grimbergen wars. The once so mighty Berthout Castle was burnt completely. It is not completely clear how Bouchout Castle looked like in the second half of the 12th century. According to Cantillon the fortification was already a strong castle. However, Willem van Craaynem, who inherited the Bouchout domain from his father Wouter, only owned about 300 to 400 acres of land at about 1160‚Äì1170. As for many minor noblemen at that time, it is therefore also possible that \\"Bouchout Castle\\" was no more than a fortified house at the centre of the swampy Bouchout domain.  Etymology  In spite of its French-like spelling, Bouchout, pronounced [bu Éu] in French, is a Flemish name, which would be written Boekhout in modern script, and pronounced [bukh…îut]. It simply means \\"beech\\", boek or boekhout being a dialectal variant of the Dutch beuk.EtymologieBank This toponym is frequent in the Dutch-speaking area.Oudnederlands woordenboek (ONW) The alternative etymology of boog-hout, meaning \\"keep your bow tensed\\", since the castle was positioned at a very strategic military location, is not substantiated.  The Donjon tower  Daniel van Bouchout (Boechout and also Wanghe), the grandson of Willem van Craaynem, is one of the most famous members of the Bouchout family. He was the first one to use the name \\"Van Bouchout\\" and fought at the Battle of Worringen in 1288. It was Daniel who played a major role in capturing Reinoud van Gelre resulting in a glorious victory for duke Jan I van Brabant. Thereafter knight Daniel van Bouchout became one of the duke's advisors. Several sources, including Doper√© and Ubregts, strongly suggest that it was knight Daniel who transformed the former fortified house into a mighty castle at about 1300. It included a large Donjon and five subsequent canals with an enormous drawbridge of in length. The Donjon tower is still preserved and is believed to be the oldest part of the current Bouchout Castle. This military Donjon has two levels and a platform. Each level has functional loopholes. The Neo-Gothic windows at level one most likely were made during the renovations of 1832, while the right-angled windows of level 2 are more original. The upper platform has battlements and merlons. At the court site, the coat of arms of the Bouchout family is visible (a red cross). A second historical member of this family was knight Jan van Bouchout (c. 1320‚Äì1391), grandson of Daniel. In 1355, Duchess Johanna succeeded her father, Duke Jan III of Brabant. This succession led to a war with Flanders, since its Lord ‚Äì Louis II, Count of Flanders ‚Äì was married with Margaret, the second daughter of Duke Jan III. The Brabant forces were beaten in 1356 at Scheut and most likely also Bouchout Castle was taken. After peace was restored, Jan became commander of Brussels. He fought against the Lord of Gerle at the battle of Baesweiler in 1371, but the Brabant troops were defeated. In 1386 however, he led a successful attack on the city of Grave at the river Meuse, thereby restoring his military distinction. Jan married Joanna van Hellebeke, but the couple did not get any heirs. It is known, however, that Jan was the father of a large number of natural descendants, who are known as \\"the children of Bouchout\\". At the end of the 14th century, the Bouchout family extended their properties which included Blaasvelt, Humbeek, van Loenhout and Diepensteyn Castle. The direct family line became extinct however and the last representative, Margareta van Bouchout, married Everhard van der Marck in the middle of the 15th century. Thereafter, Bouchout Castle was owned by the Van der Marck family (1476‚Äì1537) and the Transylvan family (1537‚Äì1590). During this period Bouchout Castle fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance. Moreover, the Spanish dominance of the Netherlands in the 16th century and the iconoclastic fury of 1566 further worsened its condition.  First maps  The illustration of Jan Baptist Gramaye in his work Gallo-Brabantia is the oldest known illustration and reveals Bouchout Castle in the first decade of the 17th century. It was Christoffel d'Assonville (1528‚Äì1606) who bought the castle in 1590 from Joanna Transylvan and restored \\"Bocholdia Castrum\\" into its glorious medieval state. Major restorations were carried out including the transformation of the five original canals into one surrounding pond. Note the very long drawbridge which is also described in the 14th century. It may however been drawn out of perspective, since the bridge appears to be about twice as long as the Donjon tower, which is about 20 meters high. The castle displays a rectangular structure with defensive towers at each corner including the Donjon which is still preserved today. The main building is at the back of the inner courtyard. D'Assonville was one of the most loyal ministers during the Spanish period and he is believed to have been part of the assault on the Prince Wiliam of Orange in 1584. In 1605, the Bouchout Domain was raised into a Barony enabling Christoffel d'Assonville to become a member of the Council of Brabant. In 1626, Peter Verbist produced a detailed copper etching of the Duchy of Brabant. The Barony of Bouchout (\\"Bochout\\") can be found at a distance of about 7 miles to the north of Brussels (to the right at the map). This detailed map also displays Grimbergen (the former Berthout Castle) and Steinhussle, the territory of the related Diepensteyn Castle. The homeland of the founding fathers of Bouchout Castle is about 5 miles to the east of Brussels and includes the villages Crainhem, Sterbeeck and Nossegem.  Peter- Ferdinand Roose  Peter-Ferdinand Roose was born in Antwerp. He was the son of Jan-Karel Roose (‚Ä† 1641), the mayor of the city of Antwerp and Anna Fredericks van Bouckhorst, lady of S√©clin. After his parents died, Peter- Ferdinand became the foster son of his oncle Peter Roose who was an important advisor of Filips IV, King of Spain. In this period, the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands were at war with its suppressor Spain, which ended with a final separation at 1648 (Peace of M√ºnster). During his career, Peter Roose had acquired a number of domains including Froidmont, Jemeppe, Han and Granvelle. Since he did not have any direct heirs, his family including his foster son Peter Ferdinand were well taken care of. Peter-Ferdinand became a lawyer and acquired Bouchout Castle in 1673 from Renom de France since he had many debts. In France, this was the period of the Renaissance during which Louis XIV of France created the Palace of Versailles. Also Brussels developed into a fashionable capital where wigs and glamour for the happy few were common items. Peter-Ferdinand Roose transformed the medieval Castle into a Renaissance castle surrounded with French ornamental gardens. Most likely, Bouchout Castle was decorated with a wealth of paintings, classy furniture and closets full with books. You may notice that the drawbridge in the etching of Jacobus Harrewijn is more in proportion as compared to the drawing of Jan Baptist Gramaye (1606). In 1700, Peter-Ferdinand died without any heirs and he joined the ornamental family grave at the chapel of the St.Goedekerk (Brussels) besides his uncle Peter Roose. During the French Revolution and the subsequent domination of the Southern Netherlands (1797‚Äì1830), Bouchout Castle was partly destroyed. The wooden bridge was dismantled and used to warm the French soldiers during the severe winter of 1795, while that part of the pond was filled up to facilitate the entrance to the castle. Further, the complete enforcement at the front was destroyed and the castle was also looted by the soldiers. Clearly, Bouchout suffered a lot during the French dominance.  Neo-Gothic style  La Salle d'armes of Bouchout Castle as published in 250px 250px = 19th century context = Since 1830, Belgium is an independent country and during the early years, it was keen to prove its right to exist. The young nation therefore referred a lot to the late Middle Ages, during which the Southern Netherlands played an important role in the development of Europe. The early Neo-Gothic renovations of Bouchout Castle performed in 1832 by count Amedeus de Beauffort should be placed in the latter context. This count of Bouchout was born in Doornik in 1806 and studied law in Paris. He married Elisabeth Roose de Baisy in 1830 and became director of fine arts in 1835. Under the supervision of architect Tilman Fran√ßois Suys, Bouchout Castle underwent a medieval metamorphosis. The Neo-Gothic renovations included, amongst others, demolishing the southern wing thereby rendering an open structure, modifying roof fa√ßades with gothic battlements, introducing neo- gothic windows, and adding further neo-gothic details to enhance the medieval charisma of the castle. Also illustrative for this period, were the curious objects and old paintings the noble families tend to collect. A fine example is the Armoury gallery (Salle d'armes) which was situated at the first floor of Bouchout Castle. In later years, the rooms adjacent to this gallery were removed and nowadays it is a conference room of 165 m¬≤. The renovated Bouchout Castle also harboured several Neo-Renaissance elements such as the fireplace at the dining room and the ceilings of the Empress Room and White Room. After the death of count Amedeus de Beauffort (‚Ä† 1858) and his wife countess Elisabeth Roose-de Baisy (‚Ä† 1873), their son Leopold became owner of Bouchout Castle. He did not marry and apparently lived in the Donjon tower. 250px = Residence of empress Charlotte = In 1879, Bouchout Domain was bought by the Belgian court and served as residence for the King's sister, Charlotte, the dowager Empress of Mexico. She married Maximilian of Austria in 1857, who became emperor of Mexico in 1864. During this period, Mexico was occupied by France. However, after the Civil War in the United States had ended, the North Americans forced Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. This left Maximilian unprotected against the Mexican Republicans and, in spite of the many entreaties of his wife, he decided to stay. He was captured and executed in 1867. Charlotte suffered a lot during this period, after which her mental condition was described as very weak. The Empress with her court was based in the castle, but she never took public engagements. Since Charlotte was the sister-in-law of Franz Joseph I of Austria, the domain was respected during World War I by the occupying German soldiers. This allowed the citizens of Meise to use the castle's domain as a place of refuge. The empress-dowager died in the castle on 19 January 1927. = National Botanic Garden of Belgium = After Empress Charlotte died in 1927, most of the furnishings were transferred to the Royal Belgium Palace at Laken. Fortunately, the domain which included Bouchout Castle and Meise Castle was bought by the Belgian State. Thereafter, part of the domain was developed into a Botanical garden which became public in 1958. In 1939, Belgian soldiers were billeted at Bouchout Castle, who looted it in November 1939. During World War II, Bouchout Castle was occupied by German soldiers, who also built four fortified shelters at the domain. In November 1944, a first flying bomb struck the west side of the Domain, causing most windows of Bouchout Castle to break. A second flying bomb struck Meise Castle, which burnt completely. The condition of Bouchout Castle worsened again during the decades after World War II. In the 1960s plans were made for the restoration of the castle. The castle was finally restored between 1987 and 1989. Since then it has served as a place for meetings, lectures and exhibitions, surrounded by the 92 hectares of the National Botanical Garden of Belgium. Bouchout Castle (nr. 3 at the map to the left) is somewhat below the centre of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium and can be easily reached from the main entrance. To the south of the castle, the Garden Shop (number 4) at the Tenant Farm displays a large number of botanical items and books related to the garden. Further to the south-east, a large complex of greenhouses (number 5) enables the visitors to travel through various climates such as the rainforest, the mediterranean and drought-monsoon greenhouses. The large western part of Bouchout Domain includes a field of large oaks (number 20), beehouses (number 38), wild roses (number 36) and maple trees (number 23). To the east of Bouchout Castle, the former Orangery (number 10) harbours a place to relax, drink and eat. At 17 June 2010, Bouchout Castle hosted the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Jan-Peter Balkenende gave a farewell party for his European friends, including Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany.

It was based on the Chevrolet Corsa C and although the Corsa was dropped from the Mexican Chevrolet line up after the model year of 2008, the Tornado lived on for a few more years. It was the only car built in Brazil in the Mexican Chevrolet lineup. =South Africa= The second generation Corsa utility was released in 2003, and replaced the Corsa B Utility pickup. The vehicle was sold as the Opel Corsa Utility, until June 2010. From then on it was badged as the Chevrolet Corsa Utility but not for too long as Chevrolet had prepared to end this and also to stop representing Opel. It was available in a choice of three engine variations, namely 1.4 and 1.8 petrol engines, as well as a 1.7 turbodiesel. There were also three different trim levels available across the range: Base, Club and Sport. Second generation (2011‚Äìpresent) Despite short sales of the Chevrolet Corsa Utility in South Africa, Chevrolet had decided to replace the Corsa C Utility with the Agile Utility.

It contains the first portion of the Sermon on the Mount, which will also take up chapters 6 and 7. Portions are similar to the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6, but much of the material is found only in Matthew. It is one of the most discussed and analyzed chapters of the New Testament. Warren Kissinger reports that among Early Christians no chapter was more often cited by early scholars. The same is true in modern scholarship. In the Middle Ages an interpretation was developed that the chapter only applied to a select group, and not to the general populace. Reformer Martin Luther, in a discussion of this chapter, was highly critical of the Catholic view. He wrote that \\"there have fallen upon this [fifth] chapter the vulgar hogs and asses, jurists and sophists, the right hand of the pope and his Mamelukes.\\" In John Wesley's analysis of the Sermon on the Mount, chapter five outlines \\"the sum of all true religion\\", allowing chapter 6 to detail \\"rules for that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward actions, unmixed with worldly desires or anxious cares for even the necessaries of life\\" and chapter 7 to provide \\"cautions against the main hinderances of religion\\".Wesley, J., Sermon 21, Upon Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount: Discourse One, accessed 10 August 2019 The source of Matthew 5 is uncertain. It contains only a handful of parallels with Mark, but does have a number of loose parallels with Luke's Sermon on the Plain. For those who believe in the two-source hypothesis, it indicates that much of this text likely came from Q. However, Harvey King McArthur notes that the parallels in Luke tend to be very loose, far further away than most areas they overlap. There are also a considerable number of verses that have no parallel in Luke. McArthur thus theorizes that there was an extra step between the sources Matthew and Luke used than usual. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 48 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 64 (Magdalen papyrus) ( to 2nd century) *Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330‚Äì360) *Papyrus 86 (4th century; extant verses 13‚Äì16, 22‚Äì25) *Codex Bezae () *Codex Washingtonianus () *Codex Alexandrinus (AD 400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (; extant verses 1‚Äì14)  Structure  The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows: * ‚Äì The Beatitudes * ‚Äì Believers are salt and light * ‚Äì Christ affirms the Law * ‚Äì Murder begins in the heart * ‚Äì Adultery in the heart * ‚Äì Marriage is sacred and binding * ‚Äì Jesus forbids oaths * ‚Äì Go the second mile * ‚Äì Love your enemies Beatitudes The Sermon on the Mount, Carl Heinrich Bloch. Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330‚Äì360), Matthew 4:19‚Äì5:22 After a brief introduction (verses 1‚Äì2) the chapter contains the section known as the Beatitudes, which includes some of Jesus' most famous teachings. Theologian Robert H. Gundry suggests the Beatitudes can be divided into two quartets. The first group outlines the persecuted nature of Jesus' disciples, and the rewards they will receive for enduring this condition. The second four list the righteous behaviour which can led to such persecution. Most scholars feel the ninth Beatitude at Matthew 5:11 is separate from the first eight, as demonstrated by its shift to the second person. Four of the Beatitudes seem to be also in Luke, the rest are only found in Matthew. The English word used to show the positive nature of the Beatitudes is blessed. A number of scholars note that this is not an ideal translation as in modern English, blessed often means \\"blessed by God\\", a meaning not implied by the Greek. William F. Albright and C. S. Mann use the more general word fortunate instead of blessed. R. T. France feels that it should be read as \\"worthy of congratulation\\". Lapide supports the New American Bible usage of happy; it directly translates the word beatus in the Vulgate, and it carries the meaning of the Greek. After the Beatitudes there are a series of metaphors, called Salt and Light, that are often seen as commentaries upon them. These include a number of famous phrases such as salt of the earth and city on a hill. Teachings on the law =The role and importance of the law= * Verse 17 ‚Äì Jesus states that he has not come to \\"abolish the law\\" but to \\"fulfill\\" it. * Verse 18 ‚Äì Jesus then declares the law to be valid until \\"Heaven and Earth pass away\\" and \\"all things are accomplished\\". * Verse 19 ‚Äì Shows a direct correlation between the act of adhering to the Biblical Code, and the righteousness of the individual. * Verse 20 ‚Äì Jesus identifies Greater Righteousness as a condition for inclusion in the Kingdom of Heaven. The NIV translation entitles \\"The Fulfillment of the Law\\", the NRSV translation entitles it \\"The Law and the Prophets\\", the United Bible Societies' \\"The Greek New Testament\\", edited by Kurt Aland, Bruce Metzger and others, entitles it the \\"Teaching about the Law.\\" This pericope is at the core of the argument about the relationship between the views attributed to Jesus, such as Gospel, Grace, New Covenant, New Commandment, Law of Christ, and those attributed to Moses or the Mosaic Law, and hence on the relationship between the New Testament and Old Testament, Christian views on the old covenant, Law and Gospel, and as a basis of Christian ethics. The reason for this argument is a disagreement about the proper interpretation of the word \\"fulfillment\\" (œÄŒªŒ∑œÅ·ø∂œÉŒ±Œπ; plerosai). This goes back at least as far as Marcion of Sinope and continues until today. Many modern scholars now consider these four verses to be a prelude to the Antitheses, but this position is not universally accepted, and many continue to interpret Matthew 5:17‚Äì20 independent of its textual neighbors. =Antitheses= The sermon then moves to a highly structured discussion (\\"Ye have heard‚Ä¶ But I say unto you\\") of the \\"Law and Prophets\\" or Old Covenant. This section (Matthew 5:17 to Matthew 5:48) is traditionally referred to as the Antitheses, or the Six Antitheses.Jeremias, J., The Sermon On The Mount. The Ethel M. Wood Lecture delivered before the University of London on 7 March 1961, London: The Athlone Press, 1961. An antithesis is a form of parallelism in which one phrase or clause contrasts with a second phrase or clause.James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3: 217), 18. Gundry disputes this title: \\"The sayings are traditionally called 'the Antitheses'. But this designation seems to imply that after stoutly affirming the Law in , Jesus contradicts it\\". Instead Gundry argues that Jesus escalates the Law towards \\"the goal toward which it was already headed, so that we should stop calling these sayings \\"the Antitheses\\" and perhaps start calling them \\"the Culminations\\".Commentary on Matthew, Robert H. Gundry, Baker Academic 2011. After the introduction (5:17‚Äì20), the next verses are commentaries on six specific topics where Jesus recites a law, starting with two of the Ten Commandments, and then comments on it. This generally sees Jesus impose more rigorous standards. The six antitheses are on: #You shall not murder in verses 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 #You shall not commit adultery in verses 27, 28, 29, 30 #Divorce in verses 31 and 32 #Oaths in verses 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 #Eye for an eye in verses 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 #Love thy neighbour as thyself in verses 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330‚Äì60), Matthew 5:22‚Äì6:4 The Jewish Encyclopedia states: Jesus' six antitheses are on six topics. In each of them, Jesus opens the statement with words to the effect: \\"You have heard it said‚Ä¶ but I say to you‚Ä¶\\" These antitheses only appear in Matthew. At the outset, Jesus made it clear that he greatly respects Old Testament Law in the Torah, and fulfilling the Law was one of his purposes for coming to Earth. Daniel J. Harrington believes that the community for which Matthew wrote primarily but not exclusively were Jewish Christians. If so, that may explain why Matthew could use Jewish rhetoric and themes without explanation. Harrington says that is not the case for 21st-century Americans and others who read the Gospel today. In the six antitheses Jesus either extends through the Commandment's scope by going to the root of the abuse (avoiding anger and lust to prevent murder and adultery) or going beyond a biblical commandment as in the case of divorce and oaths. Harrington writes that Matthew presents the six antitheses as examples of the principle that Jesus came not to abolish but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets.Harrington, Daniel J. The Gospel of Matthew . Liturgical Press, 2007. . = Murder = The first antithesis (verses 21‚Äì22) attacks anger as the root of murder. The two loosely connected illustrations (23‚Äì24, 25‚Äì26) point out the value of reconciling with one's enemy. = Adultery = The second antithesis (verses 27‚Äì28) attacks lust as the root of adultery. The sayings about the right eye and the right-hand as causes of scandal (29‚Äì30) are further instances of going to the sources of sin. = Divorce = The third antithesis (verses 31‚Äì32) explains Jesus' prohibition of divorce as a way of avoiding the divorce procedure outlined in . = Oaths = The fourth antithesis (verses 33‚Äì37) about oaths says to avoid oaths entirely so as never to swear falsely. = An eye for an eye = The fifth antithesis on non- retaliation (verses 38‚Äì39a) also urges the followers of Jesus to not seek revenge through violence. The examples not only prohibit violence, but also require that brutality and force be met with goodness. = Love for enemies = The final antithesis (verses 43‚Äì48) defines \\"neighbor\\". Here Jesus urges that love include even enemies instead of restricting love only to those who either can benefit us or who already love us. =Perfection= The chapter ends with an exhortation to perfection, the , teleios, meaning also \\"full grown\\" or \\"of full maturity\\".  Verses  Full text In the King James Version chapter five reads: ¬πAnd seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: ¬≤And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, ¬≥Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ‚Å¥Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. ‚ÅµBlessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. ‚Å∂Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. ‚Å∑Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. ‚Å∏Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. ‚ÅπBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. ¬π‚Å∞ Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ¬π¬πBlessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. ¬π¬≤Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. ¬π¬≥Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. ¬π‚Å¥Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. ¬π‚ÅµNeither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. ¬π‚Å∂Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. ¬π‚Å∑Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. ¬π‚Å∏For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. ¬π‚ÅπWhosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ¬≤‚Å∞For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. ¬≤¬πYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: ¬≤¬≤But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. ¬≤¬≥Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; ¬≤‚Å¥Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. ¬≤‚ÅµAgree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. ¬≤‚Å∂Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. ¬≤‚Å∑Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: ¬≤‚Å∏But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. ¬≤‚ÅπAnd if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. ¬≥‚Å∞And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. ¬≥¬πIt hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: ¬≥¬≤But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. ¬≥¬≥Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: ¬≥‚Å¥But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: ¬≥‚ÅµNor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. ¬≥‚Å∂Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. ¬≥‚Å∑But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. ¬≥‚Å∏Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: ¬≥‚ÅπBut I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. ‚Å¥‚Å∞And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. ‚Å¥¬πAnd whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. ‚Å¥¬≤Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. ‚Å¥¬≥Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. ‚Å¥‚Å¥But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; ‚Å¥‚ÅµThat ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. ‚Å¥‚Å∂For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? ‚Å¥‚Å∑And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? ‚Å¥‚Å∏Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Smith prevailed upon them to record more songs, all of which were new to the band and had not previously been rehearsed or performed live.Thompson, Dave (2003) A User's Guide to the Fall, Helter Skelter Publishing , pp. 63‚Äì64 In accordance with this experimental approach, members were deliberately excluded from certain tracks. Smith also stated of the songs that \\"some of them are just me and Karl double-tracked\\" Whilst these remarks resulted in considerable conjecture among fans, the exact lineups for each track have never been properly confirmed. In a letter to City Life magazine in April 1984, Smith noted that Riley only played on two tracks on Room to Live, and in 2008 Riley confirmed via his BBC6 radio show that he did not appear on all tracks. In his book \\"The Big Midweek\\", Steve Hanley states that \\"Marquis Cha-Cha\\" was recorded by a trio of himself, Burns and Smith and also confirms the role of Arthur Kadmon (from Ludus and credited as \\"Cadman\\") in the recording of \\"Hard Life in Country\\" at a session to which neither Craig Scanlon nor Marc Riley were invited. Hanley's version, however, appears to refute the much-rumoured story, as relayed by Mick Middles in his book \\"The Fall\\" (co-authored with Mark E Smith), that suggested that Kadmon recorded approximately sixteen seconds of guitar and was then dismissed. Drummer Paul Hanley described the recording of the album as \\"a fucking nightmare.

Retrieved 11 March 2018 Room to Live has been described as the band's most overtly topical album. Smith described it as \\"me going off on a tangent...most of the songs are about Britain as I see it on a wider scale, having been abroad a lot.\\" \\"Papal Visit\\" was about the first visit of a Pope to Britain in 450 years, a song Smith described as 'anti-Pope'. \\"Marquis Cha-Cha\\" concerned the Falklands War, the titular character described as \\"a Falklands-flavoured equivalent to the English-born Nazi propagandist Lord Haw Haw\\".  Critical reception  The album was described as \\"slapped together and half-baked\\" and \\"rough around the edges\\" compared to Hex Enduction Hour,Gimarc, George (2005) Punk Diary, Backbeat Books, , p. 659 although this was considered by writer Dave Thompson (who described it as \\"the sound of the band at its most spontaneous, the sound of Smith at his most inchoate\\") to be intentional, and Smith himself stated \\"I wanted to do something spontaneous...to get back to the old Fall way of recording songs straight off the top of our heads\\". Sounds reviewer Dave McCullough gave it two stars, stating that it \\"lacks bounce and zap\\" and \\"musically, the Fall really are a mess\\". The NMEs Amrik Rai called it \\"frustratingly sketchy\\" and stating that it \\"sounds as if they've written, recorded and pressed it and still got back in time for last orders\\", going on to sum it up as \\"right crap\\". The New Rolling Stone Album Guide stated that the album \\"sports fabulously irritated lyrics aimed squarely at bourgeois Britain, undercut by thinner, less compelling music, and an uninterested- sounding Smith.\\"Brackett, Nathan & Hoard, Christian (eds.) (2004) The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Simon & Schuster Ltd, , p. 294 It was also described as \\"a more self-indulgent delivery\\" than its predecessor.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , pp. 63‚Äì64 Trouser Press commented on \\"a sparser, less rhythmic sound than Hex Enduction Hour\\", going on to say \\"Smith is in top lyrical form, with pungent, satirical views of British life: 'Marquis Cha Cha' offers biting commentary on the Falklands War.\\"Azerrad, Michael; Wolk, Douglas; Pattyn, Jay \\"Fall\\", Trouser Press. Retrieved 11 March 2018 AllMusic's Dean McFarlane described it as \\"possibly the most archly political and scathing collection of diatribes the Manchester legend spewed forth onto record during what is arguably the group's creative peak\\" and \\"one of the greatest pieces of post-punk genius the group ever recorded\\". Robert Ham, writing for Stereogum was less enthusiastic, stating \\"Were it not for the seamy bass-and-scratching guitar minimalism of 'Detective Instinct' and the jaunty 'Solicitor in Studio', this would be a complete throwaway.\\" Room to Live peaked at number 4 in the UK Independent Albums Chart, spending ten weeks on the chart in total.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 84  Track listing  The 1983 German pressing of the album added the 1981 single \\"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\\" and its B-side, \\"Fantastic Life\\", to the end of side B. This inclusion was repeated on the first UK CD edition of the album issued via Cog Sinister in 1998 (mastered from a particularly noisy German vinyl copy) but was removed on the 2005 remaster (from the superior original Kamera vinyl), since the two tracks had since been included in the Slates reissue. Other contemporaneous bonus material was added in its place. The album was reissued on vinyl in 2016 with its original track listing on the Superior Viaduct label.  Personnel  ; The Fall * Mark E.

Rabbinate and scholarship Yehezkel Abramsky was born in Dashkovichy, Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Belarus) was the third child and eldest son of Mordechai Zalman Abramsky, a local timber merchant, and his wife, Freydel Goldin of Grodno. His parents were deeply religious but the village lacked enough Jews to support a prayer service so Yehezkel studied at home until the yeshivas of Telz, Mir, Slabodka and particularly Brisk under Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik. At the age of 17 he became a rabbi, serving, in turn, the communities of Smolyan, Smalyavichy, and Slutsk. Following the Russian Revolution, he was at the forefront of opposition to the Communist government's attempts to repress the Jewish religion and culture. During this time he would serve as both the Rabbi of Slutsk and Smolensk. As a result, the Soviet government refused Abramsky permission to leave and take up the rabbinate of Petah Tikva in Palestine in both 1926 and 1928. In 1926, while serving as the rabbi of Slutsk, he joined (together with Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin) the Vaad Harabbonim of the U.S.S.R.'Toldois Chabad B'Russya Ha'Sovietis' S.B.Levine, New York 1989, In 1928, he started a Hebrew magazine, Yagdil Torah (lit. \\"Make [the] Torah Great\\"), but the Soviet authorities closed it after the first two issues had appeared. In 1929, he was arrested and sentenced to five years hard labor in Siberia, where he is said to have composed Talmudic commentaries on translucent cigarette papers.Sasha Abramsky, The House of Twenty Thousand Books, (Halban,2014) New York Review of Books ed. 2015 p.50. However, in 1931 he was released due to intervention by the German government under Chancellor Br√ºning, who exchanged him for six communists they held.Sasha Abramsky, The House of Twenty Thousand Books, Halban London, 2014, pp. 57-71 & passim. London Beth Din He arrived in London towards the end of 1931, where he was appointed rabbi of the Machzike Hadath community in London's East End. In 1934, Chief Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz persuaded him to become Rosh Beth Din of the London Beth Din, a post he held until he retired to Jerusalem in 1951. The appointment of an East European chareidi rabbi to the London Beth Din was a departure for the United Synagogue, and started a tradition which continues to the present day. The prestige of the London Beth Din as a world-ranking halachic authority was greatly enhanced through the appointment of Rabbi Abramsky as Rosh Beth Din. Although other renowned talmidei chachamim served both during and since his time‚Äîsuch as Dayan Aryeh Leib Grosnass (Lev Aryeh) and Dayan Avrohom Rapoport (Be'er Avrohom), it was Dayan Abramsky above all who established the policies and customs that are followed by the London Beth Din to this day.About the London Beth Din Following his retirement from the London Beth Din, he settled in Jerusalem. While living there he also served as a rosh yeshiva of Slabodka yeshiva in Bnei Brak.RavFrand List - Rabbi Frand on Parshas Ki Savo - 5756 - Torah.org Rabbi Abramsky died in Jerusalem on 19 September 1976 (24 Elul 5736). His funeral was attended by over 40,000 people, making it one of the largest ever seen in the city. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot. Family In 1909 he married Hendl Reizel, daughter of Rabbi Yisroel Yehonasan Yerushamski (or Yershamiski), the rabbi of Orla and of Thumen, and son-in-law, through his second marriage, of \\"the Ridbaz,\\" Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky. =Descendants= He had four sons including Professor Chimen Abramsky, and was the grandfather of Professor Samson Abramsky and Jenny Abramsky.

Headed by the same ruling family, it was variously separate or united with its motherland and its Latin name was used for both indiscriminately. The mainland territory of Domnon√©e included Tr√©gor, Dol-de-Bretagne through to Go√©lo, and Penthi√®vre. History At the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, the rough area of later Domnon√©e was held by the pagan Curiosolite Gauls. Domnon√©e is said to have been founded in the 4th century by Christian Briton immigrants; it greatly expanded in the wake of subsequent waves of refugees from the Saxon invasions of Britain. Domnon√©e retained close political links between the Celtic territories in Britain (Wales, Cornwall, Devon), and the newly created Brittany. Many kings, princes, clerics and other leaders came over from Britain. The sea was a unifying rather than divisive factor. In the traditions relating to the settlement of Brittany by the Bretons there are several kingdoms of this kind.Nora Kershaw Chadwick, Celtic Kingdoms A number of legends and lives of Breton saints contain references to the close political ties between religious communities in Wales and Brittany. The close proximity resulted in possessions on both sides of the Channel by some religious orders. For example, the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Beauport, before Henry VIII, had parishes on the coast of Go√©lo and in Devon. It has been suggested that the British and Breton branches were unified for a period. Conomor, who was killed fighting Clotaire I, king of the Franks, is referred to in stories from both Britain and Brittany. He would have been a British military leader who was guarding the Channel from attacks by pirates, perhaps in alliance with Childebert I, son of Clovis. In 1034, the term was used to designate the comt√© of Penthi√®vre said to be the preserve of Eudes, second son of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. The name disappeared shortly after. History of the Principality of Dumnonia or Domnon√©e Situated to the north east of Brittany, the earliest princes are mentioned in several Lives of the Saints. The three Armorican principalities were all subservient to the King of Brittany. Until the reign of Jonas, the rulers of Domnonia were titled princes. After that, they supply the Kings of the Bretons, and Domnonia itself was elevated as a result.

Dove began his dance training at Boggs Academy in Georgia. Dove gave up his premedical studies at Howard University to transfer to the University of Wisconsin and study dance with Xenia Chilistwa of the Kirov Ballet. He then transferred to Bennington College where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in dance in 1970. He then moved to New York City and was offered a scholarship to Merce Cunningham School as well as a position in the company. While in New York he performed for Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang, and Anna Sokolow. Alvin Ailey asked Dove to join his company in 1973 after seeing Dove perform in Sokolow's Rooms. Dove soon became Alvin Ailey's principal dancer and became renowned for his ability to command the stage with a powerful and dramatic clarity. His choreographic debut came in 1979 with the piece \\"I see the moon‚Ä¶. and the moon sees me.\\" He then left Alvin Ailey the following year and became the assistant director at the Groupe de Recherche Choreographique de l'Op√©ra de Paris from 1980 to 1983. Dove then became a freelance choreographer, working for companies such as the Dutch National Ballet, the Basel Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, Dayton Contemporary Dance Company (DCDC) and the London Festival Ballet. Dove's choreography is famous for its speed, force and eroticism.DeFrantz, Thomas F. Ulysses Dove, biographical essay, PBS. Some of his more famous works are Night Shade (1982), Bad Blood (1984), Vespers (1986) originally set on DCDC, and Episodes (1987). Red Angels (1994) was created for and premiered at New York City Ballet. Twilight, which was performed on May 23, 1994 with Red Angels, was Dove's final creation.

Keywords and comments can also be assigned. * Basic editing in the form of lossless 90/180-degree rotation and flipping is supported; external programs such as GIMP, Inkscape, and custom scripts using ImageMagick can be linked to allow further processing. * Advanced searching is available using criteria such as filename, file size, age, image dimensions, similarity to a specified image, or by keywords or comments. If images have GPS coordinates embedded, you may also search for images within a radius of a geographical point. * Geeqie supports applying the colour profile embedded in an image along with the system monitor profile (or a user-specified monitor profile) * Geeqie sessions can be remotely controlled from external software, so it can be used as an image-viewer component of a bigger application. * Geeqie includes a 'find duplicates' tool which can compare images using a variety of criteria (filename, file size, visual similarity, etc.), either within a single folder or between two folders. * Images may be given a rating value (also known as a \\"star rating\\"). * Maps from http://www.openstreetmap.org may be displayed in a side panel. If an image has GPS coordinates embedded, its position will be displayed on the map - if Image Direction is encoded, that will be displayed also. If an image does not have embedded GPS coordinates, it may be dragged-and-dropped onto the map to encode its position. * A more extensive list of features may be found here. Reception Geeqie has been generally well received in the technical press. A 2012 review in Free Software Magazine said it is \\"highly recommended, if not best in class\\". A 2011 Linux Insider review awarded it 5 out of 5 stars. A 2010 Linux Magazine review called Geeqie an \\"indispensable tool\\", \\"lightning fast\\". A 2012 Libre Graphics World review noted that Geeqie seems to be \\"the only up-to-date JPS and MPO viewer on Linux right now\\". A negative review in 2010 from Tom's Hardware said it \\"doesn't offer much more than system default apps\\". GQview GQview is the predecessor to Geeqie. It had been developed from 1998 to 2006 by John Ellis, the last release being in December 2006. Efforts to contact Ellis since then proved unsuccessful, so a group of interested developers forked the GQview code, adopted the name Geeqie, and set about enhancing it. In some Linux distributions (such as Debian and its derivatives), a gqview package was provided as a shortcut to Geeqie for easier upgrade.

I-164, also known as the Robert D. Orr Highway, had a total length of . Requested as an Interstate and approved in 1968, the freeway was opened to traffic on August 2, 1990. On November 15, 2013, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) announced that most of I-164 would be renumbered I-69, an action completed in late 2014. The highway thereby became part of an extended I-69 whose route will run north from the Texas border with Mexico to the Michigan border with Canada near Port Huron. Route description Now signed as I-69, I-164 was signed north‚Äìsouth as it wrapped around the east side of the metropolitan area and then east‚Äìwest as it curved to meet US 41\\\\. West of US 41, the freeway became Veterans Memorial Parkway, an urban surface arterial which provides a direct connection with Evansville's central business district. The highway paralleled the Ohio River as it passed around the south side of Evansville. About after Veterans Parkway, I-164 turned north and almost immediately had an interchange with SR 66, locally known as the Lloyd Expressway, which is a limited access surface arterial through Evansville. After passing SR 62 (Morgan Ave), the route exited Evansville and continued through suburban area. Near the northern end of the route, SR 57 started a brief concurrency with the Interstate Highway. I-164 ended at a cloverleaf interchange with I-64, and SR 57 continued north as a two-lane surface highway. However, in the mid 2000s, construction of I-69 north of I-64 began, and now continues north on a concurrency with SR 57\\\\. History On October 18, 2013, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved an INDOT request to redesignate of I-164 to I-69 between US 41 and I-64, pending approval from the Federal Highway Administration. On November 15, 2013, INDOT announced that I-164 would become part of I-69, an action completed in late 2014. When the Interstate 69 Ohio River Bridge is complete roughly east of US 41, the remainder of the former spur will again become a spur, this time of I-69 as I-369.

Smirnov, who was closely associated with Nikolai Bukharin, was a political commissar in the Red Army and represented the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party and was the main spokesman of the Military opposition of 1919. He was a member of the editorial board of Kommunist, the organ of the Petrograd Committee of the party. Years before the October Revolution he pushed for a more militant party tactics, much to the annoyance of Lenin. He became the financial director of the governing body of the Moscow oblast, Sovnarkom, which exercised wide powers and had high ambitions of local rule, although it was abolished as early as June, 1918. His attempts at forming similar bodies proved short-lived.Timothy J. Colton: Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis pp. 68, 102f. Smirnov served in the governing bureau of the Supreme Economic Council, set up in December 1917. His Left fraction initially dominated the Council and Lenin had to take their position into account. The decline of the Russian Revolution and the cult of the Party Revolutionary Perspectives March 1, 2003-03-01, quoting R.V. Daniels: The Conscience of the Revolution. Simon and Schuster 1960, p. 84.  1919  At the 8th Party Congress of the Russian Communist Party, Smirnov appeared as a delegate from the 5th Army. On 20 March 1919, Smirnov gave a speech to the Congress on the use of former Tsarist officers (termed \\"Specialists\\" within the party) and of political commissars in the Red Army. Responding to accusations from Grigory Sokolnikov that he opposed the use of officers, which by this point had become a key part of Bolshevik military strategy, he denied favouring the use of partisan militias in the Russian Civil War. He did, however, warn of the inadequate political mechanisms that the Soviet authority had at its disposal to control the officer-specialists. Arguing for the repeal of Decree on Revolutionary Military Councils, he said to the Congress: > ...The role of the political commissars is limited to the functions of > supervision... Now that we have the political commissars with sufficient > combat experience and able not to intervene when not needed, we must give > them broader rights, a larger part in the direction of the armies. Smirnov regarded the commissars as an integral check on the potential disloyalty of the old-r√©gime officers. This preference for so-called \\"politicisation\\" of the Red Army was shared by the Left Socialist- Revolutionary Party in opposition, but largely rejected by Leon Trotsky, the People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs, who by 1919 exercised full control over the military. But in April 1919 the Central Committee of the RKP appointed Smirnov as the first organiser for ChON volunteers to support the Red Army in the civil-war effort. Opposition, prison and death In 1923 he belonged to those who signed The Declaration of 46. In 1926 Smirnov, together with Timofei Sapronov, formed the \\"Group of 15\\", which joined the United Opposition headed by Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev. They were expelled from the Communist Party at the 15th Party Congress in December 1927 along with the rest of the United Opposition. Later, on 31 December 1927 he was arrested and sentenced to expulsion from Moscow to the Ural region for 3 years. On 29 January 1930, he was sentenced again, for 3 years in prison. On 10 November 1932, the term was extended with 2 years. And on 4 November 1934, he was sent for 3 years in Siberia. After the assassination of Kirov, in March 1935, Smirnov was arrested again and by a special decision of NKVD from 22 May 1935, was re-imprisoned for 3 years. In early 1937, while serving in the Suzdal special prison, Smirnov sent letters to the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs Yezhov and the USSR Prosecutor Vyshinsky, protesting against his detention. On April 20 the same year, he was transferred to Moscow and, on 26 May 1937, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court USSR under the chairmanship of V. Ulrich sentenced him to death for participating in a counterrevolutionary terrorist organization. Smirnov was shot on the same day, becoming a victim of the Great Purge. On 16 November 1960, Smirnov was partially rehabilitated but not was fully rehabilitated until 1990.

The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, and ratification. Executive - branch The executive branch of the government of Florida consists of the governor, lieutenant governor, Florida Cabinet (which includes the attorney general, commissioner of agriculture and chief financial officer), and several executive departments.Article IV, Section 6, Florida Constitution, limits the number of executive departments to no more than 25. The constitutional limitation specifically excludes departments authorized in the Constitution such as the Fish and Wildlife Conservation (Article IV, Section 9), the Department of Veterans Affairs (Article IV, Section 11), and the Department of Elderly Affairs (Article IV, Section 12). Further, the Legislature has housed totally independent agencies under other departments (such as the Agency for Workforce Innovation being housed under the Department of Management Services pursuant to section 20.50, Florida Statutes), which prevents the independent agencies from being counted toward the constitutional limit of 25 departments. See, e.g., Agency for Health Care Administration v. Associated Industries of Florida, 678 So.2d 1239 (Fla. 1996), where the Florida Supreme Court found that the Agency was created as an independent agency within the Department of Professional Regulation and that the Agency did not count toward the \\"25 department\\" limit. Each office term is limited for two four-year terms. =Governor= The governor of Florida is the chief executive of the government of Florida and the chief administrative officer of the state responsible for the planning and budgeting for the state, and serves as chair when the governor and the Florida Cabinet sit as a decision-making body in various constitutional roles.Article IV, Sections 1(a) and 4, Florida Constitution. The governor has the power to execute Florida's laws and to call out the state militia to preserve the public peace, being commander-in-chief of the state's military forces that are not in active service of the United States. At least once every legislative session, the governor is required to deliver the \\"State of the State Address\\" to the Florida Legislature regarding the condition and operation of the state government and to suggest new legislation. =Cabinet= Department of Education Florida is unique among U.S. states in having a strong cabinet-style government. Members of the Florida Cabinet are independently elected, and have equal footing with the governor on issues under the Cabinet's jurisdiction. The Cabinet consists of the attorney general, the commissioner of agriculture and the chief financial officer. Along with the governor, each member carries one vote in the decision making process. In the event of a tie, the side of the governor is the prevailing side. Cabinet elections are held every four years, on even numbered years not divisible by four (such as 2010, 2014, etc.). The Florida attorney general is the state's chief legal officer. As defined in the Florida Constitution,Article IV, Section 4(b), Florida Constitution. the attorney general appoints a statewide prosecutor who may prosecute violations of criminal law occurring in or affecting two or more judicial circuits. The attorney general is responsible for the Department of Legal Affairs.MyFloridaLegal.com, accessed May 21, 2008. The attorney general is head of the Florida Department of Legal Affairs.Office of the Attorney General (Department of Legal Affairs). Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The Florida chief financial officer's duties include monitoring the state's finances and fiscal well being, auditing and assuring that state programs are properly spending money and overseeing the proper management of the revenue and spending of the state.Article IV, Section 4(c), Florida Constitution. The chief financial officer is the head of the Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS). The Florida commissioner of agriculture is the head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). =Agencies and departments= The purpose of agencies is to promulgate rules to implement legislation. In April 2014, there were 25,362 administrative rules, and eight agencies have over 1,000 rules each, of which the most heavily regulated agencies are the Department of Financial Services and Department of Health. The Florida Administrative Register (FAR) is the daily publication containing proposed rules and notices of state agencies. The regulations are codified in the Florida Administrative Code (FAC). There are also numerous decisions, opinions and rulings of state agencies. The state had about 122,000 employees in 2010.The Conference Report on Senate Bill 2800, the General Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2011-2012, authorizes 122,235.75 positions (before gubernatorial vetoes). That number includes 4,322.5 positions for judges, justices, and employees of the state court system (judicial branch). It does not include employees of the state university system, the legislative branch (except for 296 positions for the Public Service Commission) or employees of local governments -- counties, municipalities, school districts, Florida colleges, water management districts, etc. Legislative branch  Chamber of the Florida Senate The Florida Constitution mandates a bicameral state legislature, consisting of a Florida Senate of 40 members and a Florida House of Representatives of 120 members.These are the maximum numbers allowed. Article III, Section 16(a), Florida Constitution, provides that the Senate shall be apportioned into not less than 3, nor more than 40 Senate districts, and the House shall be apportioned into not less than 80 nor more than 120 House districts. The two bodies meet in the Florida State Capitol. The Florida House of Representative members serve for two-year terms, while Florida Senate members serve staggered four-year terms, with 20 senators up for election every two years.After dicennial apportionment of the Legislature, one-half of the Senators are elected to two-year terms to comply with Article III, Section 15(a), Florida Constitution, which requires staggered terms in the Senate (one-half of the senators elected every 2 years). Members of both houses are term limited to serve a maximum of eight years.The concept of \\"term limit\\" is commonly misunderstood in Florida. Article VI, Section 4(b), Florida Constitution, prohibits a person from appearing on the ballot for re-election if, by the end of the current term, the person will have served for eight consecutive years. The most obvious exception to the common understanding of \\"term limit\\" occurs immediately following dicennial apportionment. Twenty of the forty Senators are elected for initial terms of 2 years. They subsequently may be elected to two additional four-year terms, serving a total of ten years. At the time of the second reelection, a Senator will have served six years and is thus not precluded from serving by the eight-year limitation. Another exception that has been discussed but never tested is that a statewide elected official, after serving eight years, might run as a write-in candidate, thus not having his or her name appear on the ballot. See How to Defy Term Limits, Lakeland Ledger, August 9, 1999. There are also state auditors led by the Florida auditor general who is appointed by the Joint Legislative Auditing Committee,Sections 11.40, 11.45, and 11.51, Florida Statutes.Florida Auditor General, Ballotpedia the utility-regulating Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC),Section 350.001, Florida Statutes. and the Florida Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA). The legislature's session is part-time, meeting for 60-day regular sessions annually. The regular session of the Florida Legislature commences on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March with the governor's State of the State speech before a joint session and ends on the last Friday in April or the first Friday in May. The Florida Legislature often meets in special sessions, sometimes as many as a half dozen in a year, that are called for particular purposes, such as budget reduction or reforming property insurance. A special session may be called by the governor,Article III, Section 3, Florida Constitution. by joint proclamation of the speaker of the House and senate president or by three-fifths vote of the members of both houses.Section 11.011, Florida Statutes, and Article III, Section 3(c)(2), Florida Constitution. Outside of these regular and special sessions, the members of both houses participate in county delegation meetings and interim committee meetings throughout the year, mostly from November to February in advance of the regular session. Its session laws are compiled into the Laws of Florida, and the Florida Statutes are the codified statutory laws of the state which have general applicability. Judicial branch The Florida Supreme Court building in Tallahassee The Florida State Courts System is the unified state court system. The Florida State Courts System consists of the: * Florida Supreme Court, the state supreme court; * five District Courts of Appeal, which are intermediate appellate courts; and * two forms of trial courts: 20 circuit courts and 67 county courts, one for each of Florida counties. The Supreme Court of Florida is the highest court of Florida and consists of seven judges: the chief justice and six justices. The Court is the final arbiter of Florida law, and its decisions are binding authority for all other state courts. The five Florida District Courts of Appeal are the intermediate appellate courts. The 20 Florida circuit courts are trial courts of original jurisdiction for most controversies. ¬ß 26.012(5) (2007) The circuit courts primarily handle civil cases where the amount in controversy is greater than $15,000, and felony criminal cases, as well as appeals from county courts. Circuit courts also have jurisdiction over domestic relations, juvenile dependency, juvenile delinquency, and probate matters. The 67 Florida county courts have original jurisdiction over misdemeanor criminal cases, including violations of county and municipal ordinances, and in civil cases whose value in controversy does not exceed $15,000. Budget Each civil entity has its own budget: state, county, and municipal. =State= In June 2015, the state's debt was $25.7 billion. Capital city The commissioners charged by the government of the unified Florida to select a permanent capital selected Tallahassee, then between the two major cities of Florida, Pensacola and Saint Augustine, as the state capital, in 1823.Powers, Ormund. \\"County Never Made It As Florida's Capital\\" (Archive).

Richard Keith Call and a founder of Jacksonville, John Bellamy, wanted the capital in what is now Lake County but their efforts failed. From the beginning of Tallahassee's history there were multiple attempts to move the state capital. A July 1957 Florida Historical Quarterly article stated that this was because of Tallahassee's distance from other settlements.Andrews, Mark. \\"Tallahassee Has Had Shaky Capital Tenure\\" (Archive). Orlando Sentinel. May 3, 1992. Retrieved on May 27, 2016. As Florida's size and population grew and spread south, the center of the state's population and the geographic center of the state changed. Using data from the 2010 U.S. Census, according to the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research, the state's center of population was southern Polk County. The geographic center of the state is Brooksville. Because Tallahassee became increasingly far from many Floridians, there were additional proposals to move the capital to Orlando, a more centrally-located city, in the late 1960s.Smith, Adam C. \\"Tallahassee no longer fits as Florida's capital\\" (Archive). Tampa Bay Times. Saturday August 9, 2014. Retrieved on May 26, 2016. The City of Orlando, in 1967, passed a referendum stating that it would accept becoming the capital. These proposals stopped after the new Florida Capitol opened in Tallahassee in 1977. Politicians from North Florida had opposed the idea of moving the state capital. Adam C. Smith of the Tampa Bay Times argued in 2016 that Tallahassee is no longer an appropriate location for the capital, and he cited an American Economic Review article which stated that state capitals far from their populations are more prone to corruption than those that are not. Local government A map of Florida showing county names and boundaries There are four types of local governments in Florida: counties, municipalities, school districts, and special districts.Dye, T.R., Jewett, A. & MacManus, S.A. (2007) Politics in Florida. Tallahassee: John Scott Dailey Florida Institute of Government. Florida consists of 67 counties. Each county has officers considered \\"state\\" officers: these officials are elected locally, and their salaries and office expenses are also paid locally, but they cannot be removed from office or replaced locally, but only by the governor. The state officers subject to this requirement are the sheriff, state's attorney, public defender, tax collector, supervisor of elections, clerk of the circuit court (though styled as such, each circuit having multiple counties within its jurisdiction has a separate elected clerk within each county, and the office also handles official county records not pertaining to judicial matters), property appraiser, and judges. There is one school district for each county; the Florida Constitution allows adjoining counties to merge their districts upon voter approval.http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu;=3 =statutes#A9 Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 4 The superintendent is by default an elected official; however, the Florida Constitution allows county voters to make the position an appointed one.http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu;=3 =statutes#A9 Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 5 Municipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms. Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself can provide some of these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments. Orlando City Hall Both counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been incorporated into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature. In some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In Jacksonville, the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, Duval County, and smaller municipalities exist within it. Among special districts are \\"community development districts\\" which have virtually all the power of a city or county (except, notably, they do not have police power). Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes governs these districts. Notable CDD's include the Reedy Creek Improvement District (the location of Walt Disney World) and substantially all of The Villages (the giant Central Florida retirement community). Many counties have a \\"Soil and Water Conservation District,\\" a residue of Dust Bowl politics. Elected officials are unpaid. Much of their budget is spent on engineering staff. Critics are trying to dismantle these districts, as being obsolete.

It is widely acknowledged as the most successful and effective Italian small arm of World War II and was produced in large numbers in several variants. Italy's limited industrial base in World War II was no real barrier toward the development of advanced and effective small arms, since most weapons did require large amounts of artisan and semi-artisan man-hours to be fine-tuned and made reliable by default. Italian specialized workers excelled and the initial slow rate of production meant that the MAB 38 became available in large numbers only in 1943, when the fascist regime was toppled and Italy split between the Allied-aligned co-belligerent forces in the south and German collaborationists of the Italian Social Republic in the north. The MAB 38 was developed by Beretta to compete in the rich market of machine and sub-machine guns; it was a well-made and sturdy weapon, introducing several advanced features and was suitable for police and special army units. Presented to Italian authorities in 1939, its first customer was the Italian Ministry of Colonies, which purchased several thousands MABs to be issued as standard firearm of the Polizia dell'Africa Italiana (Italian Africa Constabulary), the government colonial police force. Army orders were slow to come; although impressed by excellent qualities and firepower of the weapon, the Italian military did not feel the MAB was suitable for standard infantry combat. It was judged ideal for police and assault units and in the beginning of 1941 small orders were placed for Carabinieri (military and civilian police), Guardie di Pubblica Sicurezza (national state police), and paratroopers. The Italian Army requested minor changes to reduce production costs, notably the changed shape of the recoil compensator and the removal of the bayonet and catch as the MAB 38A. This was the standard army variant, used throughout the war and issued to elite Italian units, paratroopers, Alpini \\"Monte Cervino\\" assault battalion, 10th Arditi Regiment, \\"M\\" Battalions of Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, Blackshirts) and military police. The Italian Royal Navy also purchased the type and MAB 38A were given to the \\"San Marco\\" Marine Regiment and naval security troops; The Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) issued the MAB 38A to its crack A.D.R.A. Regiment. Orders were still small and the Carcano M1891 rifle remained the standard weapon even in elite units. Until 1943, MAB 38A (and since 1942, the MAB 38/42) was available almost exclusively to paratroopers, Blackshirts, tank crews and Carabinieri military police, given the need of all of the former to express high volumes of firepower in prolonged actions or to keep close-quarters combat superiority. The paratroopers of the 185th Airborne Division Folgore were armed exclusively with the weapon . Blackshirt legions (one per infantry division) were regarded and used as elite assault units both for their fanaticism and their Beretta 38s. After the Italian armistice of September 8, 1943, the Italian armed forces melted away and an Italian army was reconstructed in northern Italy under German sponsorship, the Beretta MAB equipped many units. The Italian Social Republic (R.S.I.) army fought a guerrilla war against partisans from the start, as well as against the Allies. For assault and counterinsurgency units, where firepower at close range was a vital asset, it was the ideal weapon. Production of the MAB became priority and it was supplied in great numbers to R.S.I. formations, especially elite units and it became an iconic weapon, symbolizing the Italian soldier in popular culture. Later in the war, a simplified variant known as the MAB 38/44 was introduced. Regardless of the tables of organization and equipment of a unit, the Beretta 38 was a popular weapon that could eventually find its way into the hands of virtually any soldier, especially amongst officers and higher non-commissioned officers, in any type of unit. A magazine-holding vest was designed for elite troops (Blackshirts, paratroopers) armed with the Beretta 38; these were dubbed \\"Samurai\\" due to the similarity of the stacked magazines with traditional Japanese armour. A special canvas holster was issued with the MAB with two magazine-carrier pouches sewn on, to be worn as a belt but only came into use during the brief life of the R.S.I. and by then could be seen in the employ of many different units whose \\"elite\\" status could have been reasonably questioned (such as Black Brigades and other militias). The Beretta MAB was highly praised by Italian resistance movement fighters as well, being far more accurate and powerful than the British Sten which was common issue in partisan units, although the smaller Sten was more suited for clandestine operations. German soldiers also liked the Beretta MAB, judging it large and heavy, but reliable and well made. The 1938 series was extremely robust and proved very popular with Axis forces as well as Allied troops, who used captured examples.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press, (1948), p. 58 Many German soldiers, including elite forces such as the Waffen-SS and Fallschirmj√§ger forces, preferred the Beretta 38.Quarrie, Bruce, Fallschirmj√§ger: German Paratrooper, 1935-45, Osprey Publishing (2001), , , p. 59Ordnance Went Up Front, p. 58: \\"No one ever bothered with any other kind of submachine gun if he could get hold of a Beretta M38, and keep it. The New Zealand boys especially loved them. Even the Germans liked it, and they hated to admit anything was good except their own stuff\\". Germany manufactured 231,193 Beretta M38s in 1944 and 1945.Lexikon der Wehrmacht Maschinenpistolen Firing a powerfully loaded Italian version of the widely distributed 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge, the Cartuccia 9 mm M38, the Beretta was accurate at longer ranges than most other submachine guns.Ordnance Went Up Front, p. 58 The MAB could deliver an impressive firepower at close range and at longer distances its size and weight was an advantage, making the weapon stable and easy to control. In expert hands, the Beretta MAB allowed accurate short- bursts shooting up to and its effective range with Italian M38 ammunition, was s, an impressive result for a 9 mm submachine gun. Specifications MAB 38, in its first variants, was a fine weapon by any standard, crafted with high quality materials, flawlessly finished and with carefully machined parts. Models 38/42 and 38/44 were easier and faster to build, the finish was sacrificed for speed of production but the quality remained high. The mechanism was a traditional simple blowback recoil but with a novel floating firing pin, an automatic safety on open bolt (both later removed to save production costs), a recoil compensator on the muzzle, a bolt cocking handle with sliding dust cover and a striking trigger gear with no fire selector but with two triggers instead; the fore trigger was for semi-automatic fire and rear trigger for full-auto. The user could shift quickly between methods without switching levers or safety catches, which proved useful in combat. The full-auto trigger had a safety catch on left side, which was eliminated from 1942 and the rear sight was adjustable up to in the MAB 38 and 38A, the 38/42 and 38/44 variants had fixed rear sights. The MAB 38 had a wooden stock, was about long and weighed about when loaded, with an effective range of about . Variants Beretta M38/42 Beretta Model 1 with MP40-style under-folding stock Beretta M38/49 (Model 4) (note push-button cross-bolt safety located at the middle of the stock) The Model 1938 can be recognized by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship and finish and by the perforated cooling jacket over the barrel.Hogg, Ian V. and Weeks, John, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 6th ed. DBI Books, Inc. (1991), pp. 224-225 It was produced from 1938 to 1950 and fired 9√ó19mm Parabellum ammunition at 600 rounds per minute. It used 10, 20, 30 or 40-round magazines; the short 10-round magazine, when used in conjunction with the fixed bayonet, was popular with Allied and Axis forces for guarding prisoners or internal security.Smith, Joseph E., Small Arms of the World, 11th ed., Harrisburg, PA: The Stackpole Company (1969), pp. 481-482 In combat, the 30 round magazine was the most common. The original MAB 38, first issued to Italian police in 1939, had a bayonet mount and stock rest for the Carcano M91/38 folding bayonet. In compliance with Italian army requirements, bayonet mount and rest were eliminated and the recoil compensator was redesigned, the two horizontal muzzle slots substituted by 4 transversal cuttings, judged more effective. This standard army variant was renamed MAB 38A and issued in 1941. Despite its undeniable effectiveness, the Beretta Model 38 proved too time-consuming and expensive to produce during wartime. Marengoni designed a simplified model made from sheet steel, in which the cooling jacket and bayonet mount were eliminated and the separate firing pin mechanism replaced by a fixed firing pin machined on the face of the bolt. The barrel and wooden stock were also shortened to save weight and cost.Small Arms of the World, pp. 482-483 This new model the Model 38/42 had a fluted barrel to aid cooling and save weight. It also had a slower rate of fire (550 rpm). The Model 38/43, was an intermediate production stage between the 42 and 44 patterns. The 38/42 and 38/43 were adopted by the Wehrmacht as the Maschinenpistole 738(i), abbreviated as MP.738. Models produced for the German Army received German acceptance marks.Small Arms of the World, p. 429 The Model 38/44 was a minor revision of the 38/43, in which the bolt was simplified and a large-diameter recoil spring used in place of the operating spring guide. It also eliminated the fluting to save time and increase production. The 38/44 was also adopted by the German army as the MP.739. A variant of the Model 38/44 was fitted with an MP40-style under-folding stock as the Model 1. After World War II, the 38/44 continued in production in slightly revised form as the 38/49 series: the Model 2 or MP 38/44 Special with an MP40-style under-folding stock and extended magazine well, the Model 3 with an extended magazine well and telescoping steel-wire buttstock and the Model 4 with a standard wooden rifle stock. All of these models have a push- button cross-bolt safety catch at the middle of the stock After Marengoni's death, Beretta engineer Domenico Salza revised the safety system of the Model 38/49 series as the Model 5, identified by a large rectangular grip-safety button located in the stock's finger groove.Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, pp. 224-225http://world.guns.ru/smg/it/beretta-m1938-e.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20020112104153/http://www.nasog.net/datasheets/firearms/smg/Beretta_Model_3.htm The Model 5 was produced for the Italian Army, police and the armed forces of several other nations until 1961, when production ceased in favor of the compact, modern Beretta M12. Unusually, it ejects to the left because of the non-reciprocating cocking/charging handle and slot cover being in the way on the right side.

The third and final of the pair's albums for the label, it is a suite of selections from the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. Orchestral arrangements are by Russell Garcia, who had previously arranged the 1956 jazz vocal recording The Complete Porgy and Bess. Background In 1959, a big- budget film version produced by Samuel Goldwyn and directed Otto Preminger arrived in theaters. To coincide with the film, many jazz and vocal versions of the work were produced on records, this one and the celebrated Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaboration among them. The double album was released in both mono and stereo, and on compact disc in 1990. It is also part of the set The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong on Verve issued in 1997. Given the nature of the work, only five tracks feature vocals by both Armstrong and Fitzgerald. Reception In 2001, it was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, a special achievement prize established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \\"qualitative or historical significance.\\"Grammy Hall of Fame Database The album is considered the most musically successful amongst the jazz vocal versions of the opera. The AllMusic review of the album claimed \\"What's really great about the Ella and Louis version is Ella, who handles each aria with disarming delicacy, clarion intensity, or usually a blend of both... Pops sounds like he really savored each duet, and his trumpet work ‚Äì not a whole lot of it, because this is not a trumpeter's opera ‚Äì is characteristically good as gold.

The Order of the Redeemer is the oldest and highest decoration awarded by the modern Greek state.  Establishment  The establishment of the Order of the Redeemer was decided by the Fourth National Assembly at Argos in 1829, during the final year of the Greek War of Independence. The decision was not immediately implemented, however, and the relevant decree was signed in Nafplio by the Regency Council (Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, Karl von Abel and Georg Ludwig von Maurer) in the name of King Otto on May 20, 1833. (Government Gazette 19, issue A, dated 20 Jan. 1833) According to the decree of establishment, the name of the Order \\"shall recall the, by divine assistance miraculously and fortuitously accomplished, salvation of Greece\\".  Grades and award criteria  Since its establishment in 1833, and in common with all Greek orders of merit, the Order of the Redeemer has five classes: *60px Grand Cross ('ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªœåœÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ') ‚Äì wears the badge of the Order on a sash on the right shoulder, and the star of the Order on the left chest; *60px Grand Commander ('ŒëŒΩœéœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑œÇ') ‚Äì wears the badge of the Order on a necklet, and the star of the Order on the right chest; *60px Commander ('Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑œÇ') - wears the badge of the Order on a necklet; *60px Gold Cross ('ŒßœÅœÖœÉŒøœçœÇ Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ') ‚Äì wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest; *60px Silver Cross ('ŒëœÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒøœçœÇ Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ') ‚Äì wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest. According to the original decree, the Order was to be awarded to those Greek citizens who took part in the War of Independence, or \\"who should distinguish themselves henceforth in any branch of public service, in the army and navy, in the diplomatic and judicial corps, in public administration, in the arts, science, agriculture and industry, commerce, or should distinguish themselves in any other social field through outstanding civic virtue, and through illustrious services to the Throne, for the Glory of the Hellenic name and for the welfare of the fatherland\\", while foreigners were admitted either for past services to Greece, or due to their ability \\"to bring honour to the Order, through their outstanding personal virtues and excellence\\". The original decree set specific limits on the number of awards: while the Silver Cross could be awarded at will, Gold Crosses were limited to 120, Commanders to 30, Grand Commanders to 20, and Grand Crosses to 12. Foreign recipients, as well as princes of the Greek royal family, did not count to these totals. In modern times, in practice the Grand Cross is awarded only to foreign heads of state. The first person to be awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer was King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the father of King Otto, in 1833. Other distinguished recipients included Andreas Miaoulis in 1835, Baron Guenther Heinrich von Berg on 21 February 1837 Petrobey Mavromichalis, Alexandros Mavrokordatos and Lazaros Kountouriotis in 1836, Andreas Zaimis, Theodoros Kolokotronis and Georgios Kountouriotis in 1837, and Constantine Kanaris in 1864. Insignia The form of the various insignias has been altered a number of times since the establishment of the order, the most obvious change being the removal of the crown during the periods of republican rule. The present form of insignias is regulated by Presidential Decree 849/1975 (Œ¶ŒïŒö 273 ŒëŒÑ/4-12-1975). The original decree of 1833 described the badge of the Order as consisting of a white enamelled Maltese cross (silver for the Silver Cross, gold for the higher grades), surmounted by a crown, set on a green enamelled wreath, one half of which is an oak branch and the other half a laurel branch. The obverse featured a white cross on a blue background (the coat of arms of Greece) with Otto's Bavarian arms in an inescutcheon in the centre, surrounded by this inscription on an outer ring: Œó ŒîŒïŒûŒôŒë Œ£ŒüŒ• ŒßŒïŒôŒ°, ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒôŒï, ŒîŒïŒîŒüŒûŒëŒ£Œ§ŒëŒô ŒïŒù ŒôŒ£ŒßŒ•Œô (\\"Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power\\", Exodus, 15:6). The reverse featured a portrait of Otto with the circular inscription: ŒüŒòŒ©Œù, ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ•Œ£ Œ§ŒóŒ£ ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒüŒ£ (\\"Otto, King of Greece\\"). After Otto's deposition in 1863, his portrait was removed and substituted by an icon of Jesus, the Redeemer of Orthodox Christian soteriology. This resulted in the wearing of this side as the obverse, with the national coat of arms (purged of the Bavarian escutcheon) relegated to the reverse, and the inscriptions correspondingly changed: the obverse's inscription remained in place, and the reverse came to feature a new inscription: Œó ŒïŒù ŒëŒ°ŒìŒïŒô Œî¬¥ ŒïŒòŒùŒôŒöŒó Œ§Œ©Œù ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒ©Œù Œ£Œ•ŒùŒïŒõŒïŒ•Œ£ŒôŒ£ - 1829 (\\"The IV National Assembly of the Hellenes at Argos ‚Äì 1829\\"). The star of the Order is an eight-pointed faceted silver star with the same central disc as on the badge of the Order. At first the stars were embroidered, but eventually, they were made of solid silver, a practice that continues to this day. The ribbon of the Order is light blue, edged with white, reflecting the national colours of Greece.  References  External links * The Greek Royal Orders * George J.

It holds the rail car to a section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be lower, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load. The \\"Double Rotary\\" coal gondola or coal hopper is required in this consist. The \\"Double Rotary\\" referring to these cars that has rotary couplers on both ends instead of one end.  History  In 1893, Timothy Long filed for a patent on a rotary car dumper.Timothy Long, Dumping apparatus for railway cars, , granted Oct. 9, 1894. This dumper required the car to be uncoupled because the dumper rolled the car to the side as it dumped. In 1901, Erskine Ramsay filed for a patent on a rotary dumper where the center of rotation of the dumper was aligned with the coupling.Erskine Ramsay, Revolvable Car Dumping Structure, , granted June 3, 1902. When combined with Janney couplers that were free to rotate, this permitted dumping cars without uncoupling them from the train. The rotary mine-car dumper offered by the Ottumwa Box-Car Loader Company in 1909 could dump five relatively small mine cars per minute. Prior to this, the common method of dumping mine cars was to tip them endwise.Revolving Car Dump, Mines and Minerals, Vol. XXIX, No. 9 (April 1909); page 413. By 1921, the Car Dumper Equipment Company was offering a wide variety of rotary dumpers, including not only standard gauge dumpers, but also dumpers for use on mine railways; some of the latter were designed to dump an entire train in one operation.Car Dumper Equipment Company, The Mining Catalog (Metal and Quarry Ed.), Keystone, Pittsburgh, 1921; page 295.  Alternatives  The primary alternative to rotary dumping has long been provided by a wide variety of self-unloading cars. Most of these are bottom-dump cars of various sorts, equipped with doors of one sort or another at the bottom to allow bulk cargo to be unloaded by gravity. Drop-bottom gondolas, for example, are low- sided open-topped cars where much of the floor of the car is composed of trapdoors.Cars, Freight: General Views, Car Builders' Cyclopedia of American Practice, Vol. 3; Figs. 21-23., see also the definition of drop-bottom on page 48.Spencer Otis, Drop Bottom Dump Car, , granted Jan. 24, 1905. While drop- bottom cars could usually be used for other purposes, side-dump cars and hopper cars with sloping floors to guide the cargo to unloading doors can only be used for bulk cargo.Car-bodies, Freight: Goldola Cars, Car Builders' Cyclopedia of American Practice, Vol. 3; Figs. 21-23., see also the definition of hopper-bottom car on page 68.Halbert Powers Gillette, Chapter X: Methods and Cost with Cars, Earthwork and Its Cost, McGraw Hill, New York, 1920; pages 335-338 discuss side-dump cars. All of these have the advantage that they can be unloaded anywhere, but the disadvantage that any imperfection in the seals of the doors allows material to spill onto the track. In the mining industry, the long established standard for dumping mine cars was to run them into horns at the ends of the rails at the tipple. The inertia of the car would cause it and sometimes a short segment of hinged rail to tip forward, dumping the load out the end of the car.Les Benedict, director, The Last Pony Mine, part 2, Film Production Unit, Iowa State University, Ames, 1972; at 10:37 (2:12 in part 2), the film shows a mine car being dumped. Some of these dump mechanisms completely overturned the car end-for-end, and some allowed the car to continue onward after being dumped.International Correspondence Schools, The Elements of Mining Engineering Vol. 3, The Colliery Engineer Co., Scranton, 1900; pages 63-69, paragraphs 2644-2653. In the 19th century, a patent was issued for a machine to tip entire railroad cars endwise for unloading.Patrick H. Kane, Car Loading and Unloading Device, , granted Sept. 23, 1884. Bulk cargo such as grain shipped in boxcars poses particular problems. The Ottumwa Box Car Loader Company built boxcar unloaders that both tipped the car sideways and rocked it end for end so that the cargo would spill out the side door.William E. Hunt, Car Unloader, , issued May 14, 1918. One of these machines was in use in Portland, Oregon in 1921.A Mechanical Box Car Loader and Unloader, Railway Review, Vol. 68, No. 16 (April 16, 1921); pages 606-607.

Just north of I-464's terminus is a cloverleaf interchange with I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway), between which US 17 and SR 168 run concurrently with northbound and southbound I-464, respectively. US 17 and SR 168 join I-64 for their own short concurrencies, with US 17 heading west toward Suffolk and SR 168 heading east toward Virginia Beach. I-464 heads north as a six-lane freeway that meets US 13 (Military Highway) at a diamond interchange and crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Norfolk District. I-464 passes over US 460 and SR 166 (Bainbridge Boulevard) with no access; the connection is made indirectly through a diamond interchange with Freeman Avenue, which serves one of the industrial areas along the Southern Branch Elizabeth River. The Interstate parallels Bainbridge Boulevard north to a cloverleaf interchange with SR 337 (Poindexter Street), which leads to the recently-replaced South Norfolk Jordan Bridge which provides alternate access to Portsmouth. I-464 crosses over another Norfolk Southern rail line at the boundary between Chesapeake and Norfolk and has a partial interchange with South Main Street before reaching its northern terminus at a directional interchange with I-264 in the Berkley neighborhood of Norfolk. The ramp from northbound I-464 to westbound I-264, which passes through a trench, also provides access to State Street and Berkley Avenue. Eastbound I-264 crosses the Eastern Branch Elizabeth River on the Berkley Bridge into downtown Norfolk. Westbound I-264 passes under the Southern Branch via the Downtown Tunnel into the city of Portsmouth. History Under the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), the U.S. 17 corridor past the southern terminus is now designated part of the route of a Future Interstate 87 which will eventually continue the freeway south into North Carolina, then follow the route of U.S. Route 64 west to connect to Interstate 95 in Rocky Mount and eventually to Interstate 40 in Raleigh. This project will provide a critical southern freeway link between the Hampton Roads metropolitan area and North Carolina's Research Triangle.

History Young America's Foundation was founded in 1969 at Vanderbilt UniversityYoung America's Foundation history at official website. when students formed an organization called University Information Services (UIS). UIS was established to provide students with a familial atmosphere to express their conservative beliefs. When UIS became a national organization in the early 1970s, it changed its name to Young America‚Äôs Foundation. Young America's Foundation held the first National Conservative Student Conference in 1979. It is a co- founder of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference and has been a prominent supporter of the event since then. In 1998 it purchased the Reagan Ranch, \\"Rancho del Cielo\\", near Santa Barbara, California, with the help of a $10 million endowment from Amway billionaires Richard and Helen DeVos. The Ruhes helped YAF \\"retire the Reagan Ranch note early\\". YAF president Ron Robinson commented that YAF's goal was \\"preserving and protecting\\" both Reagan's legacy and the ranch itself and that it would maintain the facilities as they existed when the Reagans lived there. According to an article in Time by John Cloud, by 2004, there were no left-wing youth organizations as powerful as The Young America's Foundation (YAF), The Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) and The Leadership Institute. The same author stated, a \\"majority of 2003 freshmen ‚Äî 53% ‚Äî wanted affirmative action abolished, compared with only 43% of all adults. Two-thirds of frosh favored abortion rights in 1992; only 55% did so in last year's survey. Support for gun control has slipped in recent years among the young, and last year 53% of students believed that \\"wealthy people should pay a larger share of taxes than they do now,\\" compared with 72% 11 years earlier\\". According to The New York Times, by 2005, there was a \\"renewed shift pronouncedly to the right on many defining issues\\". Young Americans for Freedom, Young America's Foundation, the Leadership Institute, the Collegiate Network, and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute college organizations that were \\"fueled and often financed by an array of conservative interest groups\\". By 2005, \\"51 percent of freshmen were for [casual sex] in 1987; [by 2005] 42 percent are. In 1989, 66 percent of freshmen believed abortion should be legal; [by 2005], only 54 percent do. In 1995, 66 percent of kids agreed that wealthy people should pay a larger share of taxes; [by 2005] it [was] down to 50 percent. Even on the issue of firearms, where students have traditionally favored stiffer controls, there has been a weakening in support for gun laws\\". By 2017, YAF had 250 high school and college affiliated known as Young Americans for Freedom, which was originally a separate organization. In July 2019, it was announced that former Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker would become YAF's president in 2021. In November 2019, YAF cut ties with one of their long-time featured speakers, Michelle Malkin, who voiced her support for alt-right journalist, Nick Fuentes. Programs Young America‚Äôs Foundation is a tax-exempt educational foundation. The Foundation's programs include lectures on college and high school campuses, conferences throughout the United States, and campus activism initiatives. These programs are broadcast on C-SPAN.

Stanton Evans, is currently a project of Young America's Foundation that places college students and recent graduates at media organizations in the Washington, D.C. area. Notable alumni include Ann Coulter, Tim Carney, and Malcolm Gladwell. =Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) = On March 16, 2011, Young Americans for Freedom passed a National Board Resolution which resulted in the merger of two organizations into the Young America's Foundation on April 1, 2011. Young Americans for Freedom (YAF), was founded on September 11, 1960 at the family home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut. The charter for the Young Americans for Freedom, written by M. Stanton Evans, the Sharon Statement,was described by K.E.Grubbs in 2010 as \\"the late 20th century's single most elegant distillation of conservative principles\\". The Heritage Foundation described the Sharon Statement as \\"statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism\\". Funding Donors include Pat Sajak, the Koch brothers, and Amway billionaires Richard and Helen DeVos. Robert Ruhe (1929 - 2013), an orthodontist in California, was the single largest donor of the YAF, with his legacy estate gift of $16 million. This resulted in a doubling of YAF's programming, which includes campus speeches. During his lifetime he and his wife donated generously to YAF, particularly in terms of paying off the mortgage of the Reagan Ranch.

The capital city's Olympic plans were to build on top of the legacy created after the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow's River Plan called for every single competition to be staged within city limits, which made the city's proposal one of the most compact ever. All existing venues were to have been extensively renovated and more venues were planned to be constructed in time for the Olympics. A new, modern athletes village would have been constructed on the Moscow River, which was the centerpiece and core of the city's Olympic bid. Despite the high support from the entire nation and invaluable experience, Moscow's bid suffered from a lack of accommodation and an older transport system which may not have been able to cope with the expected traffic from the Olympics. Moscow was seen as the dark horse to win the nomination for the Olympics. Moscow was eliminated in the first round of the ballot to select a host city at the 117th IOC sitting on July 6, 2005 in Singapore.

The following is an excerpt from their report: :Moscow proposes a memorable experience for all athletes with minimal travel times to venues. This would occur in a country which is establishing itself as the \\"New Russia.\\" Current levels of some air pollutants are a concern but are improving. The budgeting process follows IOC guidelines. While low in sports venue operations, the budget appears to be reasonable and achievable. While Moscow has good sports experience and a high number of existing competition venues, the bid committee has not presented detailed design and operational plans or a detailed construction schedule. Although planning lacked detail, the Commission believes that the Moscow 2012 village concept is feasible.

It is dedicated to Oscar I, king of Sweden and Norway. Background Schumann began to sketch the symphony on December 12, 1845, and had a robust draft of the entire work by December 28. He spent most of the next year orchestrating, beginning February 12, 1846.Seaton, 192 His depression and poor health, including ringing in his ears, prevented him finishing the work until October 19. The uplifting tone of the symphony is thus remarkable considering Schumann's health problems during the time of its composition - the work can be seen as a Beethovenian triumph over fate/pessimism, as Beethoven himself described in the Heiligenstadt Testament. The year of 1845 was important for Schumann because it signaled a shift in his compositional strategy. He began to compose away from the pianoRoesner, Linda Correll. ‚ÄúThe Chamber Music.‚Äù Chapter. In The Cambridge Companion to Schumann, edited by Beate Perrey, 123‚Äì147. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007., as he noted in his writing: > Not until the year 1845, when I began to conceive and work out everything in > my head, did an entirely different manner of composition begin to develop The strategic shift above can be ascribed to his intensive study of counterpoint in the same year with his wife, Clara Schumann. Daverio, John, and Eric Sams. 2001 \\"Schumann, Robert.\\" Grove Music Online. 16 Mar. 2019. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000040704. Hence, this symphony can be seen as a direct product of his shift of compositional strategy and counterpoint study. Movements It is written in the traditional four-movement form, and as often in the nineteenth century the Scherzo precedes the Adagio. All four movements are in C major, except the first part of the slow movement (in C minor); the work is thus homotonal: The first movement begins with a slow brass chorale, elements of which recur through the piece. (Schumann wrote the Six Organ Fugues on B-A-C-H, Op. 60, just before this symphony, and this preoccupation with Bach suggests a chorale prelude, a quintessential Bachian genre, in the texture and feeling of the symphony's opening. Possibly, too, Schumann was inspired by the sombre brass fanfare at the start of Haydn's 'London Symphony' (No. 104), which uses the same tonic-dominant progression.) The following Sonata-Allegro is dramatic and turbulent. It is characterized by sharp rhythmic formulae (double-dotted rhythms) and by the masterly transformation of the material of the Introduction. The second movement is a scherzo in C major with two trios, whose main portion strongly emphasizes the diminished chord‚Äîits characteristic gesture being a rapid and playful resolution of this chord over unstable harmony. The second trio employs the B-A-C-H motif in the context of flowing eighth notes reminiscent of the Baroque, further suggesting that Bach remained on Schumann's mind after the completion of his Op. 60. The Adagio espressivo is a sonata movement in C minor, with the character of an elegy, its middle section strongly contrapuntal in texture. The finale is in a very freely treated sonata form, its second theme related to the opening theme of the Adagio. Later in the movement at bar 280, a new theme appears: this theme has, as its sources of inspiration, the last song from Beethoven's cycle \\"An die ferne Geliebte\\" (cf. also Schumann's Piano Fantasy in C, Op. 17 and String Quartet op. 41/2), and Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy.\\" The coda of the Finale recalls the material from the Introduction, thereby thematically spanning the entire work. A typical performance lasts between 35 and 40 minutes. It is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets (in B), two bassoons, two French horns (in C), two trumpets (in C), three trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani, and strings. Performance history The symphony was first performed on November 5, 1846, at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig with Felix Mendelssohn conducting. It was better received after a second performance some ten days later. The work ultimately came to be admired in the nineteenth century for its \\"perceived metaphysical content\\",Seaton, 191 but the symphony's popularity waned in the twentieth, owing to its unusual structure.

It is the fifth main installment in the Mega Man X series. It was first released for the PlayStation in Japan on November 30, 2000 and in North America and PAL territories the following year. Mega Man X5 is set in the 22nd century in a world where humans coexist with humanoid androids called \\"Reploids\\". Daily life is under a constant threat of these Reploids going \\"Maverick\\" and participating in dangerous and deadly crime. After the events of Mega Man X4, the Maverick leader Sigma has been revived and seeks to unlock the true power of the former Maverick Zero and destroy the hero X in the process. To make matters worse, Sigma has set the space colony Eurasia on a 16-hour collision course with Earth. It is up to X and Zero to stop Sigma once again and save the planet from destruction. Like its predecessors, Mega Man X5 is an action- platform game in which the player controls either protagonist through a series of eight, selectable stages and wins the special weapon of each stage's boss. However, the game only offers limited number of stage attempts before the player must deal with the colony. According to Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mega Man X5 was originally intended to be the final game in the Mega Man X saga. Critical reception for the game was lukewarm, with many reviewers agreeing that the stale gameplay formula will only further satisfy diehard fans of the series. Mega Man X5 was ported to the Microsoft Windows as retail packages in 2002 in both Japan and North America. It was also re-released in 2006 as part of the Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. Mega Man X5 was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line for North America and Japan in 2014. It became available for Windows via Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as a part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan. Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th -Capcom Unity Plot Several months have passed since the events of Mega Man X4. The series' primary antagonist, Sigma, has been revived once again, and conducts research on the origin of the \\"Maverick Hunter\\" Zero. He decides to attempt to unlock Zero's true power, hoping to destroy X in the process. Sigma attacks the Hunters directly, but intentionally loses, thus spreading the Sigma Virus across the Earth and throwing it into chaos. Meanwhile, a Reploid mercenary named Dynamo is hired by Sigma to cause a space colony, Eurasia, to collide with Earth in 16 hours. To prevent Eurasia from striking the planet, the Hunters pursue two options: fire a powerful cannon called \\"Enigma\\" at Eurasia and vaporize it, or if the Enigma fails, launch a space shuttle and pilot it into the colony, destroying it. To maximize their chances, X and Zero are dispatched to collect parts for the two devices with the aid of their new teammates Alia, Douglas, and Signas. The necessary parts to upgrade the Enigma and shuttle are held by eight Mavericks, and X and Zero must defeat them to claim the parts. Whether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail is randomly determined by the game. Obtaining the parts increases the chances of success, but the Enigma and shuttle can be used at any time, even before any Mavericks are defeated. The following scenarios can occur: *The Enigma is fired and will either succeed and completely destroy Eurasia, or fail and only destroy part of it. **If the Enigma succeeds, Eurasia is destroyed, but this releases the Zero Virus. **If the Enigma fails, Eurasia's orbit will shift slightly and its impending impact will be delayed. In this scenario, Signas will begin the space shuttle plan, and X and Zero are dispatched to recover the parts. *Like the Enigma, the shuttle can either succeed or fail. **If the shuttle succeeds, 86% of Eurasia is destroyed and Earth is no longer in danger. Zero, who pilots the shuttle, safely returns, but some remains from Eurasia still crash into Earth, devastating its ecosystems and spreading pollution all over the planet. (The events of Mega Man X6 show this is the scenario that actually occurred.) **If the shuttle fails, only part of Eurasia is destroyed and crashes into Earth, causing a disaster as most Reploids and humans are wiped out. Zero becomes a Maverick. *If time runs out, Eurasia crashes into Earth, and the planet barely survives. Zero becomes a Maverick. Whether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail, a new virus appears on the Earth, dubbed the \\"Zero Virus\\" by Alia. The location of the virus' origin is discovered, and the Hunters investigate a bizarre underground fortress (if Zero became a Maverick, only X is playable for the remainder of the game). Deep inside the fortress, X and Zero cross paths, where mutual suspicion and mistrust leads to a duel between the heroes. After the duel, Sigma appears to try and take advantage of the situation, and the story diverges slightly. *If Zero became a Maverick, he sacrifices himself to save X, and X continues on alone to defeat Sigma. *If Zero did not become a Maverick, he saves X and himself from Sigma, and both have a chance to confront Sigma. The game has three possible endings: *If Zero became a Maverick, X defeats Sigma alone, but is badly damaged. Dr. Light appears and repairs him, but deletes all of his memories of Zero. *If Zero did not become a Maverick, Sigma tries to make the Hunters' victory for naught by taking them both down with him. Zero manages to finish Sigma off, and the endings diverge again depending on the player character. **If X defeats Sigma, he inherits Zero's beam saber and continues to fight as a Maverick Hunter. (The events of Mega Man X6 show this is the scenario that actually occurred). **If Zero defeats Sigma, he reflects on his origin and life, with visions of a blurred Dr. Wily and Iris, before dying. Gameplay The main gameplay remains similar to previous installments, with some changes: *X and Zero can duck. *X and Zero's shots will not travel through walls. *Unlike X4, the player can freely switch between both the shooter X and the swordsman Zero when selecting a stage, but the choice of character at the beginning of the game permanently affects the other character. **If X is chosen, Zero loses the ability to fire his Z-Buster. **If Zero is chosen, X loses his armor from Mega Man X4, called the \\"Fourth Armor\\" by the game. *There are four available armors for X‚Äîthe Fourth Armor, Falcon Armor, Gaia Armor, and Ultimate Armor. **The Falcon and Gaia Armors must be assembled from Dr. Light's upgrade capsules in four parts, but unlike previous Mega Man X series games, X cannot wear the new armors until they are fully assembled. Zero can enter the upgrade capsules to download the data for later use by X, but cannot use the armors himself. **The Ultimate Armor is obtained via a cheat code entered at the beginning of the game or from a special capsule that can be found near the end of the game. *Zero can receive a black armor, either with the use of a cheat code at the beginning of the game (like in X4), or by entering Dr. Light's Ultimate Armor capsule. Unlike X4, in which it was purely aesthetic, the black armor in X5 will upgrade his defensive and offensive power, increase his weapon energy, and grant him the Shock Buffer, Shot Eraser, and Virus Buster parts even if not previously obtained. *Sigma Viruses appear in levels which can infect X and Zero: **If X is infected, he will enter a state where his health rapidly declines. **If Zero is infected, he becomes briefly invincible, with increased attack power. *Performance during stages will be graded based on completion time, damage taken, and mavericks destroyed, modifying X and Zero's \\"hunter ranks\\" which are initially B and SA respectively. *Mavericks will have a \\"level\\" based on the time remaining to destroy the Engima, hunter rank, and number of previous Mavericks defeated. Mavericks of high enough level will grant weapon and life upgrades when defeated, and Mavericks of even higher level will grant special \\"parts\\" when defeated that enhance X and Zero's abilities. Development Mega Man X5 was originally meant to be the last game of the Mega Man X series. As stated by producer Keiji Inafune, \\"I had very little to do with X5. I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and left it at that. That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it.\\" However, Capcom decided to publish Mega Man X6 the following year, in which Zero survived his fight from X5, much to the dismay of Inafune. Haruki Suetsugu, an artist for Mega Man X4, designed nearly all of the characters and promotional artwork for Mega Man X5. Suetsugu added various details to set the characters apart from one another. X's new Falcon Armor was designed by Ryuji Higurashi, who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the Inazuman manga series. The Maverick bosses in the English localization of Mega Man X5 are named after members of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. Capcom voice actress Alyson Court, who was involved in the game's localization, came up with the new names as a tribute to her then-husband's love of the band. For the Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 release, the Maverick Bosses names were changed to translations of their original Japanese names.Mega Man Undoes One Of Its Weirdest Choices With New X Collection -Gamespot The musical score for Mega Man X5 was composed by Naoto Tanaka, Naoya Kamisaka, and Takuya Miyawaki. The Japanese version of Mega Man X5 features one opening theme, \\"Monkey\\", and one closing theme, , both composed and performed by Showtaro Morikubo and his band Mosquito Milk. All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003. The theme songs were also included on the Rockman Theme Song Collection, published by Suleputer in 2002. Reception Mega Man X5 was generally well-received, with IGN giving the game an 8.5 out of 10. However, they added that though the game was fun to play, it was \\"more of the same\\" from Capcom, and that Mega Man, like many other series made by Capcom, was being milked for as much as it was worth. GameSpot similarly commented that \\"Fans of the classic 2D games will no doubt find much to love in X5, while those who can't get into the aging conventions and mechanics probably won't care a great deal for it.\\" The Official UK PlayStation Magazine said that the game was \\"unforgivably primitive\\". According to the Japanese publication Famitsu, Mega Man X5 was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its release week at 46,033 copies sold. It placed at number eight the following week with an additional 22,963 copies sold. Media Create sales information showed that the game was 96th best-selling video game in Japan during 2000. Dengeki Online reported that Mega Man X5 sold a total of 215,687 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, listing it as the 132nd best-selling game of the year in the region. The game was eventually re-released as part of Sony's PlayStation The Best for Family range of budget titles in Japan. Toy Retail Sales Tracking (TRST) sales data showed that Mega Man X5 was the fifth best-selling PlayStation game in North America for the month of February 2001. The game was included on the North American Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2006.

He was president of Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia from 2005 until his death in 2014. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the University of Notre Dame, and his Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. He served as a postdoctoral fellow at the St. Louis University Medical Center, and a research fellow and NIH Fellow in the department of biochemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago prior to joining the faculty of Midwestern University. Prior to his career at Marshall, Kopp had been serving as a Special Assistant to the Chancellor with the Ohio Board of Regents. Dr. Kopp served as Provost at Ohio University from 2002 to 2004 in Athens, Ohio. He also was founding Dean of the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow College of Health Professions at Central Michigan University, and founding Dean of the College of Allied Health Professions at Midwestern University. He also served in a variety of positions for nearly 20 years at the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine. Kopp assumed the presidency on July 1, 2005, taking over from interim president Michael J. Farrell. During that time, MU invested more than $300 million in new buildings and building renovations, including the new Visual Arts Center in downtown Huntington, the $55 million Arthur Weisberg Family Applied Engineering Complex, the $48 million Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center, the $23.5 million Erma Ora Byrd Clinical Center, the $44 million Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, the $17 million Chris Cline Athletic Complex indoor practice facility and the $8 million Veterans Memorial Soccer Complex. Marshall‚Äôs academic profile grew dramatically under Kopp with new high-demand majors and degree programs, including digital forensics and the new schools of pharmacy, physical therapy and public health. Facing declining undergraduate enrollment at the beginning of his term, Kopp went on a tour statewide of high schools throughout West Virginia and was able to help Marshall reach record highs for undergraduate enrollment. Under his leadership, the four-year undergraduate engineering program was re-established and is now fully accredited. Also, external funding for research doubled and a $30 million research endowment has been established at Marshall, following the successful mini-campaign to raise $15 million in private gifts. President Kopp was the architect for the West Virginia Research Trust Fund legislation, which has matched dollar-for-dollar the private gifts to Marshall in support research. He was also a key figure in guiding the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine out of its LCME probationary period in 2011 to reaccreditation in 2013 along with Dean Joseph I. Shapiro, whom Kopp was very instrumental in recruiting to Marshall in 2012. Kopp died on December 17, 2014, of an apparent heart attack.

There were Connexions Centres around the country ‚Äì usually several in each county ‚Äì which offered support and advice on topics including education, housing, health, relationships, drugs and finance. Since 2012, Connexions has not been a coherent national service, following changes to the delivery of careers in England and the establishment of the National Careers Service by the Coalition government. Some local authorities have retained its branding, however. History Connexions was formerly The Careers Service, which had its organisation altered throughout the Conservative government's privatisation process in the mid-1990s. During the period of Labour Government the Connexions service became increasingly focused on the delivery of targeted services to those who were often described as most in need of help. One interesting initiative was the introduction of the Connexions Card. Following the 2010 election of the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition the future of Connexions was called into question. Where Connexions was retained as a branding, it was a local decision, and there was considerable local divergence around branding and delivery. Government guidance from 2011 stated that \\"There will be no expectation that local authorities should provide universal careers services once the new careers service is established.\\"Statutory Guidance for Local Authorities on Targeted Support Services for Young People (April 2011) http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/l/la%20guidance%20april%202011.pdf The new career service referred to is the National Careers Service, which was established on 1 April 2012. =Perceptions of the service= A 2010 research report by the National Youth Agency and the Local Government AssociationHibbert, T. (2010). Face-to-face What young people think about information, advice and guidance . National Youth Agency. noted that some young people were unclear about the role and function of Connexions, although those who had interacted with the service were generally positive about it. Structure Through this process, funding that was originally given directly to local councils for the delivery of the service, was henceforth allocated directly by central government (via regional offices) to private careers companies. This meant the Labour government was more easily able to use funds previously allocated for careers services, for the creation of the Connexions service. The service was originally intended to be constituted by professionals from a range of backgrounds (careers advisers, youth workers, counsellors, health workers, teachers etc.). However, as the funding for these other professions lay within the control of local councils it was not as accessible. The result was that the careers service in England was abolished and replaced by Connexions, but it was made up predominantly of career guidance professionals and was not really the multi-disciplinary organisation originally envisaged. However, Connexions services typically worked closely with many other services, particularly those within local government, such as the Young Offenders Team (YOT), Teenage Pregnancy Workers, Children's Services, but also Housing Associations, Job Centres, and others. From 1 April 2008 responsibility for providing Connexions Services was transferred to local authorities in each area ( rather than the Connexions Partnerships). Some chose to take services in-house, others to commission services from other providers. The brand however, remained. As a result, there was very little in terms of uniformity. Berkshire Connexions, for example, was run differently, and structured differently, to Surrey or Oxfordshire Connexions. There were 47 Connexions Partnerships throughout the country. These partnership offices managed the Connexions service on a local level, bringing together all the key youth support services in their area. The partnership offices managed the Connexions Centres in their locality. Following early public spending cuts under the Coalition Government Connexions services were badly hit. In many areas the service vanished altogether, whilst in others the service remained. Typically support for the NEET group has continued to be funded through the local authority, but the careers element of the Connexions service was eventually devolved to schools. Delivery Principally, Connexions offered an impartial, client-centred, careers, information and guidance service. The staff were known as Connexions Personal Advisers, and were trained to offer confidential advice and practical help relating to a wide range of issues. The concern was that the result was a professional that was a 'jack of all trades, master of none', with many ex-career guidance professionals in particular concerned that the increased remit of their role has been detrimental to their expertise and knowledge in matters of career guidance. A web site, Connexions Direct, offered information on various topics of potential interest to young people in England. Connexions also offered one-to-one support by telephone, SMS, and instant messaging. =Information sharing policy= Consent was nominally sought prior to sharing information, such as school attendance records, unless there was a statutory or common law duty to do so. Such consent was not necessarily limited in scope, or length of time in effect. Consequently, confidentiality may not be guaranteed.

It is the sixth main entry in the Mega Man X series. The game was first released on the PlayStation in Japan on November 29, 2001 and was later made available in both North America and Europe. The plot of Mega Man X6 takes place during the 22nd century where humans and intelligent robots called \\"Reploids\\" live together. The game follows shortly after the events of Mega Man X5 in which planet Earth was devastated by an attack by the \\"Maverick\\" leader Sigma and the protagonist Zero sacrificed his own life to save it. As the world recovers, a Maverick known only as the \\"Zero Nightmare\\" has begun spreading chaos. Zero's comrade X, curious of its name, seeks out this new threat. Like past games in the series, Mega Man X6 is an action-platformer in which the player tackles a series of stages and adds the unique weapon of each boss to X's arsenal. Prominent series artist and producer Keiji Inafune was not involved in the game's production, as he had intended the fifth installment in the series to be the last with Zero's death. Critically, Mega Man X6 has received mixed to positive reviews. The game was released for the Microsoft Windows in different parts of Asia in 2002 and 2003. It was also re- released in 2006 as part of the North American Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. Mega Man X6 was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line on July 8, 2015 in Japan. It was released for the Windows internationally, along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as a part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 (Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2 in Japan) on July 24, 2018 and July 26, 2018 for Japan. Plot Three weeks have passed since the events of Mega Man X5. Zero is missing, presumed dead. As a result of the Eurasia space colony incident, Earth's surface has been rendered uninhabitable, forcing the human population to take refuge underground. An intelligent Reploid researcher, Gate, is searching through the ruins of Eurasia and finds something unusual. A week later, Gate goes mad as he completes an experiment, and declares his intentions to turn Earth into a utopia for high-class Reploids. Meanwhile, X is awakened by Alia after a dream involving Zero, and she informs him of a large Maverick near Eurasia. He briefly encounters a being reminiscent to Zero, although the being appears distorted and discolored. X then meets a scientist named Isoc and his subordinate, High Max, who are in the search of the Zero-like being, which they identify as the \\"Zero Nightmare\\". Isoc invites all Reploids to join his cause to destroy the Nightmare phenomena, which is turning the Reploid population into Mavericks. However, this is revealed to be a ruse to lure Reploids to areas affected by the Nightmare, where they will become Mavericks under Gate's control. X journeys to the suspected areas to investigate the Nightmare phenomena and rescue the Reploids who volunteered to help. He learns that Isoc's eight investigators have been infected by the Nightmare and become Mavericks. During his battles, X can also encounter the Zero Nightmare and defeat him. Following this, the real Zero appears, unaware of how he survived his battle against Sigma.Note: While in the English version Zero claims he managed to repair his own damaged body, the Japanese version has him without any knowledge of what helped him survive. While talking with a Dr. Light hologram, Zero is still unsure in both English and Japanese versions. Nonetheless, he reunites with X, and rejoins the Maverick Hunters to continue investigating the Nightmare. Following the defeat of the eight investigators (or High Max), X and Zero meet Gate, who reveals he found a piece of Zero's DNA at the Eurasia crash site. The DNA drove Gate insane, and he created the Nightmare phenomena alongside the Zero Nightmare to help build his utopia. The Hunters go to Gate's laboratory to put to a stop to his plans. Following Gate's defeat, he confesses he has rebuilt Sigma, and was using him as a trump card, but Sigma is a shell of his former self: a partially coherent, half-built body, with his programming still severely damaged. However, Sigma has enough strength to nearly kill Gate, and challenges X and Zero. With his sanity slipping, Sigma is once again defeated and one of three endings will occur, depending on which character defeats Sigma: *If X defeats Sigma and previously defeated the Zero Nightmare, Zero is alongside X as he rescues Gate so that Alia, his former colleague, can try and revive him if she chooses to do so. The three make a pact to repair the devastated Earth, while Gate's ultimate fate is never revealed. *If X defeats Sigma, but did not defeat the Zero Nightmare, Alia is instead with X at the end, who thanks him for rescuing Gate. X leaves Gate's fate up to Alia, which is left unknown. Zero is then shown to be alive, but refrains from revealing himself to X and Alia, despite the two being able to sense his presence. Zero says he'll be leaving the fighting to X for a while, as there's something he needs to do. *If Zero defeats Sigma, he is seen at a laboratory at an undetermined period in the future. Fearing that he still possesses the Sigma Virus and could become a Maverick, he requests to be placed in stasis. An unknown scientist agrees to help him, and seals Zero away for the next 102 years, presumably leading to the events of the Mega Man Zero series. Gameplay The gameplay is very similar to Mega Man X5. The player can select X with the option to outfit him with different armors offering unique abilities (most of which have to be downloaded, as always, through Dr. Light's hidden capsules.) Zero can be unlocked after finding and defeating the Zero Nightmare, bringing his own weapons and techniques to the fold, including a refined Z-Saber fighting style. Both characters can be equipped with various power-up items earned after rescuing certain Reploids. Mega Man X6 has an increased emphasis on rescuing Reploids over previous titles in the series. Whereas previous games rewarded the player with health or an extra life, Mega Man X6 rewards the player with additional parts or other permanent prizes. Rescuing Reploids was made more difficult in this game with the addition of the Nightmare, which makes any Reploid it infects evil, thus rendering the Reploid impossible to save. The parts system was altered as well. Rather than attach a certain part to a certain armor, parts are attached to the character itself. The number of parts that can be equipped at once is dependent on the player's rank, which is increased by harvesting Nightmare Souls. Depending on the player's actions during the game, it's possible to unlock what are normally the final set of stages, namely Gate's laboratory, much earlier than normal than what is considered the norm for the X series; with the exception of Mega Man X5, players normally had to defeat the 8 main bosses before unlocking the final stages. In X6, defeating both the Zero Nightmare and High Max, Isoc's bodyguard, are enough to unlock Gate's laboratory before even defeating most of the main bosses. Development Series producer Keiji Inafune was not involved in the development of Mega Man X6. He had originally intended for the fifth chapter in the series to be the last due to the death of Zero at that game's conclusion. \\"And so I‚Äôd always planned to make Zero come back to life in the Mega Man Zero series, but then X6 comes out sooner from another division and Zero comes back to life in that, and I‚Äôm like, 'What's this!? Now my story for Zero doesn‚Äôt make sense! Zero's been brought back to life two times!'\\" Inafune also felt he owed fans of the series an apology for the decision to create Mega Man X6, although the series was \\"starting to go in a direction out of [his] control\\" at that point. Artist Haruki Suetsugu, who had worked on both previous PlayStation Mega Man X games, signed on as the game's primary character designer and promotional artwork illustrator. Suetsugu stated that the development schedule of Mega Man X6 was tight. As such, he described his designs for the Maverick bosses were \\"relatively simple\\", and he took a similar approach to designing all of them: for instance, all of the Mavericks have the characteristic head fins and forehead jewel found on their creator Gate's helmet. The designs for other characters also feature unique traits, including Gate as a \\"merging of scientists and combatants, High Max as \\"big and strong\\", and the DNA-like Nightmare. The background music for Mega Man X6 was composed by Naoto Tanaka. The game also features the opening vocal songs \\"Moon Light\\" and \\"The Answer\\" by Showtaro Morikubo (the voice actor for X) and the ending theme \\"I.D.E.A\\" by RoST. This is one of the few X games to have the opening song appear in both the Japanese and English versions. All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003. The game was not dubbed in any language other than the original Japanese, and the North American and European versions retained the Japanese voice tracks, using translated English subtitles to tell the story. The voice tracks for the cutscenes were removed completely when Mega Man X6 was re-released as a part of Mega Man X Collection for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube in North America in 2006, though the in-game voice tracks are still retained. Reception According to the Japanese magazine Famitsu, Mega Man X6 was the seventh best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 39,318 units sold. Dengeki Online reported that Mega Man X6 sold a total of 106,980 units in Japan by the end of 2001, marking it as the 109th best-selling game of the year in the region. The game eventually saw a re-release as part of the PlayStation the Best range of budget titles. Mega Man X6 was also included on the North American Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2006. Mega Man X6 received mixed to positive reviews, with an average score of 69% on GameRankings. GameSpot gave the game a 7 out of 10, saying that the game is \\"a disappointing effort. The nightmare system and item collecting add variety and longevity to the game, but... The graphics aren't really even up to the standards set by older games in the series, and while the music is good, there aren't any tracks that particularly stand out. Despite these shortcomings, it's still Mega Man, and the gameplay is still entertaining, making X6 an attractive package for hard-core Mega Man fans.\\" IGN gave a more positive review, an 8 out 10, stating \\"It's an all-new Mega Man game, yet it's still pretty much the same. There's nothing wrong with that\\"; they praised the soundtrack and replay value. Among the most negative reviews, Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 3.5 out of 10, saying \\"I thought I‚Äôd sooner see Sasquatch ride a Chimera bareback through the streets than a bland series like Mega Man X last through six installments.\\" In retrospective, 1UP.com referred to Mega Man X6 as \\"sloppy\\" citing multiple issues within its design such as repetitive stages and background images.

Founded in 1871 as Onondaga Pottery Company (O.P. Co.) in the town of Geddes, the company initially produced earthenware; in the late 19th century, O.P.Co., began producing fine china, for which it found a strong market particularly in hotels, restaurants, and railroad dining cars. The company closed in 2009. History In 1841, W. H. Farrar started a small pottery business in the town of Geddes, New York. Seventeen years later he moved the business to the location of what would become the Onondaga Pottery Company and eventually Syracuse China. Mr. Farrar produced whiskey jugs, butter crocks, and mixing bowls in stoneware. A few years later the Empire Pottery company was organized to take over the Farrar Pottery. A line of \\"whiteware\\" for table use was added. Like most pottery of the time, it was susceptible to \\"crazing\\" - small cracks in the glazed surface. The company struggled along until 1871 at which time Onondaga Pottery Company was organized and took over. Popular taste demanded a finer ceramic tableware than the heavy pottery made by these companies. Onondaga Pottery started producing a heavy earthenware called \\"Ironstone\\" but struggle to succeed. In 1873, they began manufacturing a \\"white graniteware\\" and then in 1885 a semi-vitreous ware. A year later they replaced this with high fired china and a guarantee that the glaze would not crackle or craze - the first time American-made tableware carried such a warranty. It was at this point, 45 years after the start of pottery production in Syracuse that the pottery business showed a stable and profitable prospect. Under President James Pass, O.P.Co. developed a new china body and won the medal for translucent china at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In 1897 production turned to the vitreous china body. Its first colored china body, \\"Old Ivory,\\" appeared in 1926. The company thrived with its hotel and railroad sales. The narrow-bodied \\"Econo-Rim\\" was tailored for the cramped table space of dining cars. Highly sought after collectible patterns sell regularly on eBay and at estate sales. The company was renowned for its fine china designs until 1970 when it limited its production to mostly restaurant dinnerware. End of production On April 9, 2009, after 138 years of production, the Syracuse China factory was shut down by Libbey, Inc. of Toledo Ohio, and all production of Syracuse China moved from North America. At that time, the plant had 275 employees. On the last day of production, each employee was given a commemorative plate with a montage of images from throughout the company's history and eight of the company logos used over the course of the company's history. The face of the plate states, \\"Though the world may change around us, our history remains the same.\\" The back of each plate was stamped \\"38-A,\\" the last date stamp to appear on a Syracuse China product made in Syracuse. The \\"38\\" is code for the year it was made (1971, the company's centennial year, plus 38 years). The \\"A\\" stands for the first quarter of the year. The back of each plate also has text indicating it was one of the last \\"pieces to be made in Syracuse, N.Y.\\" The archives and china collections were donated to the Onondaga Historical Association. The \\"Turner-Over Club\\" Syracuse China sponsored the Turner- Over Club (later the Turn-Over Club) as a promotion for decades. The company gave out membership cards, with the idea that wherever members traveled, they would \\"turn over\\" their dinnerware to see if it was Syracuse China; witnesses to this curious behavior would then be treated to the story of the club and thus introduced to the brand name.

It is the seventh main game in the Mega Man X series and the first in the series to appear on the sixth generation of gaming consoles. Mega Man X7 was first released in Japan on July 17, 2003, with North American and European releases following in October 2003 and March 2004 respectively. It was also released for Microsoft Windows exclusively in South Korea until the re-release as part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 (Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2 in Japan) in July 24 2018 for the worldwide release and July 26, 2018 for Japan,Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th -Capcom Unity whose Windows version was released internationally via Steam along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. It is the first Mega Man X in the series to feature bilingual audio. The next game in the series, Mega Man X8, also features bilingual audio. It is the first and only Mega Man X game to be a third-person shooter (as well as the third Mega Man game to use third-person view due to the Mega Man Legends franchise). Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century. Daily human life is often disrupted by \\"Maverick\\" crime from the \\"Reploids\\" robots that live and work among them. The heroic \\"Maverick Hunter\\" Mega Man X has retired from the battlefield. As such, various groups have begun springing up to stamp out the ever constant threat of Maverick activity. Axl, a member of \\"Red Alert\\", questions his group's methods and deserts the team, only to be pursued by its leader, Red. Like other games in the series, Mega Man X7 is an action-platform game in which the player fights through an octet of selectable stages. The game differs from previous side-scrolling entries by featuring fully 3D graphics intermixed with both 3D and 2D gameplay. The development of Mega Man X7 involved a challenging transition of the well-known Mega Man X characters into 3D. However, the reinvention of the series in both graphical and gameplay respects was met with a hostile critical reception. Reviewers found the game's foray into the third dimension well-intended but poorly executed. Plot Following the Eurasia and Nightmare incidents, Reploids work diligently to rebuild the Earth. Growing weary of the seemingly never-ending Maverick Wars, X decides to retire in search of more peaceful solutions, leaving Zero in charge. In X's absence, Maverick activity rapidly begins to rise, which leads to the formation of an unsanctioned anti-Maverick vigilante group known as Red Alert. As the group grows more and more reckless, one of their members, a new generation Reploid prototype named Axl, decides to defect. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting them, and goes on a rampage to get him back. Axl is chased through a city by a mechaniloid sent by Red Alert to retrieve him, and the ensuing chaos draws the attention of Zero. After a battle against the mechaniloid, Zero takes Axl into custody at Maverick Hunter HQ. In response, Red issues a challenge to the Hunters: he will release some Mavericks that Red Alert has in captivity, and whichever group can defeat the Mavericks first will gain possession of Axl. Zero goes into action without hesitation, and Axl's remorse for what he has done fuels his desire to become a Maverick Hunter. As Zero and Axl battle Red Alert, Axl reveals that he possesses the ability to copy the DNA of other Reploids, making him invaluable to Red. X initially stays out of the conflict, feeling that it is pointless, but later joins in hoping to end the war quickly. Elsewhere, Red communicates with a mysterious figure known as \\"The Professor,\\" who gives him additional power and shows him what Axl's copy ability can do. The Professor then takes possession of Red Alert, and orders Red to retrieve Axl. Following the defeat of the Mavericks, the Hunters infiltrate Crimson Palace, the home base of Red Alert. There they defeat a reluctant Red and discover a rebuilt Sigma, who was behind Red Alert's corruption. Despite the Hunters defeating Sigma twice, he rises once again and punches Axl through a wall, before vowing to X and Zero that he will again return. Suddenly, Red reappears and Sigma attempts to possess him, but it turns out to be Axl (copying Red's DNA), who then proceeds to blast Sigma out of a window from the top of the palace. The ending of the game depends on which character was used to defeat Sigma: * In X's ending, X adamantly refuses to train Axl to become a Maverick Hunter, thinking he is too young and immature. Signas tries to reason with X, warning him that they have not seen the last of the Mavericks. * Axl's ending shows him arguing with X regarding his future as a Hunter. Alia interrupts to inform them of a Maverick outbreak, to which Axl runs off to deal with, much to X's displeasure. * In Zero's ending, he has a nightmare in which X gains a strange desire to destroy all Mavericks, foreshadowing the rise of Copy X in Mega Man Zero. Gameplay Mega Man X7 is the first of the two games in the series to have 3D gameplay in addition to the standard 2D style. When starting the game, the player has only access to returning Maverick Hunter Zero and newcomer Axl. The player can send the two characters to the same stage and both can be changed whenever the player needs to. In order to unlock X, the player must rescue 64 reploids (out of a possible total of 128) or defeat the eight main bosses in order to unlock him. Unlike the prequel, chips must be used immediately after they are gained and cannot be deactivated, nor changed from one playable character to another. Once all the chips for that playable character are completely maxed out, that particular character can no longer receive anymore chip upgrades. While Zero and X retain their common weaponry, Axl has a new ability called \\"Copy Shot\\". If the player destroys certain types of enemies with said technique, they will leave an item upon their destruction. If the item (a glowing red sphere) is picked up, Axl will transform into a copy of the enemy he destroyed, with all of its features (speed, weapon, etc.). The game also has a New Game Plus feature, by completing the game and saving it, and then starting a new game from loading that particular save file. This feature allows for X to become available after the opening stage and all the chip upgrades from the previous game are retained. Development Mega Man X7 was developed by a team of about 30 people, led by producers Tatsuya Minami and Tatsuya Kitabayashi of Capcom Production Studio 3. This was the first game in the Mega Man series worked on by Kitabayashi. He explained that transitioning the character models of Mega Man X from 2D to 3D graphics was a challenge, but that including both 2D and 3D gameplay was not, as they had planned to have them in equal amounts for the game. The development team took into account the less-than-favorable reception for Mega Man X6, but instead of simply trying to make the next game new and fresh with 3D graphics, they decided to focus on \\"getting 3D right\\". The team also attempted to build upon the action-style gameplay for which the Mega Man franchise is known along with the more adult-themed storyline of the Mega Man X series. This involved adding the newer, non-traditional character Axl to deepen and better the narrative. Kitabayashi emphasized, \\"He's young, he's running away. He's like the new younger character of the group, and that's why I wanted to put him in there.\\" Minami stated in an interview that the game would feature multiplayer for up to two players. However, the final version of the game lacks this option. Prominent Mega Man artist and Capcom producer Keiji Inafune had little involvement in the Mega Man X series after the fifth installment. His only contribution to Mega Man X7 was lending advice to the illustrators on creating the new protagonist Axl. Inafune had been careful to make X and Zero unique when he originally designed them, and he wanted to give Axl the same treatment. The game's primary artist, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, signed on when the project was well underway. He decided to take after his predecessor Haruki Suetsugu for the direction in which to design the characters. Yoshikawa thought the team would have to create \\"polygon friendly\\" bosses, but decided to stick to the traditional design concepts set forth by the early Mega Man X games. As the series had finally transition into 3D, Yoshikawa also expected the team to rethink the way the game was made as they had done in the first Mega Man X title. Inafune stated, \\"My personal opinion was that 3D is simply a graphical style, and just because a game is going 3D like X7 was, it doesn't mean we 'have to' make it a 3D game. The musical score for Mega Man X7 was composed by nine individuals. A 46-song soundtrack was released by Suleputer in Japan on October 1, 2003. The game's opening theme, \\"Code Crush\\", is performed by Rina Aiuchi. The ending theme is \\"Lazy Mind\\", performed by Showtaro Morikubo, the voice actor for X in the Japanese games. A CD single for each of the songs was released in Japan on July 20, 2003 and August 6, 2003 respectively. Reception Mega Man X7 debuted on Japanese sales charts as the third best-selling video game at copies. By its second week on sale, the game had sold 71,739 copies in the region and by its third week, 89,775 copies. Media Create sales data lists the game as having sold 111,778 copies by the end of 2003 in Japan. A budget re-release of the game was included alongside the PlayStation versions of the first six original Mega Man games as part of the Rockman Collection in Japan on December 19, 2003. Mega Man X7 received mixed to negative reviews. While it attracted some positive remarks for the character switching and Reploid rescue systems, the general consensus was that the game's mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay was well- intentioned but poorly executed. IGN found the characters unbalanced as the shooters X and Axl felt far more useful than the melee fighter Zero. In particular, critics commented that the camera and controls do not translate well from 2D to 3D. Criticism has been aimed at the English voice actors' performance, to the point that it has been recommended to try listening to the original Japanese audio. The music has been described as generic and, while appealing, it does not stand out against what previous installments have offered. GameSpy concluded \\"I can't fault Capcom or the MMX7 team for trying to reinvent a series that had obviously completely lost its way... [but] the flaccid 2D sections in this game aren't half as good as any of the levels in the original Mega Man X. The 3D bits are more compelling, but still substandard.\\" IGN instead placed the blame wholly on the 3D sections: \\"We can't help but think that Mega Man X7 would have been better-suited staying 2D. But until Capcom realizes that the better action-oriented 3D titles allow you to manipulate the camera whole-heartedly, future installments of the series will likely run into the same problems that this one did.\\" In a retrospective article involving the franchise's worst games, 1UP.com included Mega Man X7 citing \\"usual 3D design issues\\" and the titular character requiring to be unlocked as the game's flaws. GamesRadar compared it with the similarly poor received Castlevania for the Nintendo 64 due to how both games tried staying away from their predecessors' formula by adding 3D gameplay and the transition failed to gamers.

It is the eighth and final game in the Mega Man X series. It was first released in North America on December 7, 2004. The PS2 version, as well as a Microsoft Windows iteration, were released in Japan and Europe the following year. On December 16, 2015 it was released on PlayStation Network in Japan. It was re-released for Windows via Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan as a part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 (Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2 in Japan).Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th -Capcom Unity The plot of Mega Man X8 focuses on the abduction of a next- generation \\"Reploid\\", Lumine from the construction site of a space elevator, and the subsequent pursuit of his captors. During the course of game play the motivations of these captors comes into focus, and it is up to the heroes, led by X, to stop them. The gameplay of Mega Man X8 is similar to the other games in the series, in which the player must complete a series of stages. Defeating their bosses will earn that player character its special weapon which differs between each character. Mega Man X8 abandoned the 3D gameplay of Mega Man X7 for a 2.5D approach. The game was met with mixed reviews. Plot In late 21XX, the Maverick Wars continue with no end in sight. To escape the carnage, humans have begun migrating to the Moon as part of an initiative known as the \\"Jakob Project\\", which involves an orbital elevator built in the Galapagos Islands. One night while X is out on patrol, one of the elevators breaks off and comes crashing down to Earth. As X approaches the elevator, the doors open, revealing an entire army of Sigmas. Suddenly, a purple-haired Reploid arrives and introduces himself as Lumine, the director of the Jakob Project. He reveals the \\"Sigma army\\" isn't what it appears to be; instead, they are new generation Reploids created as part of the project who are immune from viruses and able to use DNA copy data to change their shapes and appearances to assist with space development. Everything seems to be running smoothly until Vile, who was last seen in Mega Man X3, returns and kidnaps Lumine, causing Maverick uprisings all over the world. While battling the Mavericks, the Hunters pick up hints that Sigma has returned and teasing a concept called \\"the new world\\". Eventually, Sigma is tracked to the Moon, where he unveils his ultimate plan: eradicate the \\"old generation\\" and re-populate it with his \\"children\\". He reveals all of the new generation Reploids contain a copy chip which possesses his DNA, meaning these 'virus-proof' Reploids are essentially copies of Sigma. When Sigma is defeated, Lumine emerges from the shadows and congratulates the Hunters on finally destroying Sigma once and for all, before admitting he was manipulating Sigma in order to get his DNA and is behind the entire plot. Lumine gloats to the stunned Hunters that in order for evolution to take its course, he and the new generation Reploids must destroy both the humans and \\"obsolete\\" Reploids. After a massive struggle, Lumine is defeated, but he warns them that it is too late to stop what has already begun. As Axl approaches Lumine's body, a tentacle springs from it and breaks the crystal on his helmet, knocking him unconscious. The ending of the game varies slightly depending on which character defeats Lumine. As the Hunters ride back down the orbital elevator, Zero wonders if he no longer has to fight now that Sigma is dead for good, while X ponders Lumine's words on evolution. Zero tells X not to let his words get to him, as new generation Reploids becoming Sigma could hardly be called evolution. Furthermore, he tells X that even if they are destined to join the scrap heap when that evolution does comes about, they'll still have to fight, not only against the Mavericks, but against their own destinies as well. A post-credits scene explains that the news of Lumine turning Maverick resulted in ceasing production of DNA copy chips. However, due to the increasing need of advanced Reploids for space development, production resumed several years later, despite the objections of many. Meanwhile, as the Hunters continue to descend the orbital elevator, a faint purple light emits from Axl's shattered helmet crystal, suggesting that Lumine's spirit lives on. Gameplay Overall gameplay in Mega Man X8 is mostly similar to previous Mega Man X games and has removed the 3D style from Mega Man X7 in favor of a 2.5D style, although two of the stages, namely \\"Central White\\" and \\"Dynasty\\", are fully 3D, played aboard a vehicle with a close third-person view. After an introductory stage, Mega Man X8 presents the player with a choice of 8 stages, with a Maverick robot serving as the stage boss. After defeating the 8 bosses, a series of fortress stages open up for the player to complete in linear progression until the final boss is defeated. This game also has an option of three difficulty modes, with slight differences between each mode. Normal or hard mode is recommended if players want to observe the ending and fight the \\"real\\" final boss. The player starts the game with access to three playable characters: X, a shooter able to wear multiple armors that can be mixed and matched which opens up possibilities for customizing x's abilities, Axl, a shooter able to transform into enemies and fire in any direction; and Zero, a sword fighter able to double jump. Additionally, Zero can equip additional weapons that can be purchased as chips at the store such as hammers, fans and additional swords after finding a certain rare metal for it, excluding one of the weapons which is only available for purchase upon completing the game with Zero or entering a code in the title screen of the PlayStation 2 and Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 versions. Axl's gameplay had been slightly reworked to make him more different from X, such as gaining the ability to acquire new guns after defeating each boss, instead of gaining their weapon and can fire in any direction. X8 introduces new mechanics to the game; the first is Guard Break, which can break enemy defenses when enemies are attacked with certain weapons. The second is Double Attack, where the playable character and the chosen partner character perform a screen-filling attack that causes heavy damage to all enemies on screen. Additionally, X's new armor, the Neutral Armor, can be customized with parts that can either form two new armors the Icarus or Hermes armor, or mixed together for different effects. However, mixed parts of armors are not as effective as complete armors which lack the Giga attack ability, forcing players to choose wisely when building armors. Two characters can be selected to go to a stage, while a navigator can be assigned to assist the player. Depending on the navigator's qualities, the character will be informed about the stages' hidden paths or boss weaknesses. In every stage, the characters can obtain items that can be used in a shop to buy upgrades. The three navigators can also be unlocked as the playable characters by buying chips after completing the game in the Normal or Hard levels or entering the code in the title screen of the PlayStation 2 version and later Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 re-release. Much like with X7, this game is also equipped with New Game Plus features, which allow players to start a new game from an old save file upon completion of the previous game. Aside from the aforementioned unlockable features, all chips that were purchased in the store during the previous game are retained. Players also have the option of starting fresh by deleting any of these chips and repurchasing them later. Development Mega Man X8 was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1. The game's direct predecessor, Mega Man X7, was the first entry in the Mega Man X series to feature full 3D graphics, as well as 3D gameplay. However, as stated by Capcom producer and original Mega Man illustrator Keiji Inafune, the development team chose not to pursue 3D gameplay for Mega Man X8 simply because of its graphical style. Inafune himself was not involved in the production of Mega Man X8, although the game's art designers did consult with him before changing the overall style of the characters. The game's main illustrator, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, was responsible for designing the protagonists, the Maverick bosses, and the newer ancillary cast. Yoshikawa took into account what the characters may resemble if they were toys, and even imitated the joints of Revoltech figures. The musical score for Mega Man X8 was co-composed by Yuko Komiyama, Naoto Tanaka, and Shinya Okada. The 51-song Rockman X8 Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on April 13, 2005 by Suleputer. The Japanese opening theme for PlayStation 2 (also available for PC platform in any regional version, including Europe which had received the North American opening theme in the European PlayStation 2 version) is \\"Wild Fang\\" by Janne Da Arc; the band had previously done television advertisement themes for Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Battle Network 2. However, the theme was not included in the soundtrack and was even omitted on the game's localization in English for PS2 platform. A Windows version of Mega Man X8 was released in Asia, Europe, and as a download from GameStop in North America. This version can run in windowed mode, in addition to full screen, and includes mouse and keyboard features, although it does support using a controller. The Windows version also features several languages and the possibility to toggle between Japanese and English voices, which can be changed from the main menu or after starting a new game. All of the music and cutscene dialogue is encoded in Ogg Vorbis format. Reception Mega Man X8 received a mixed reception. It was generally praised for returning to a more classic style of Mega Man gameplay and removing the criticized gameplay elements of Mega Man X7. IGN praised the game for its mixture of 2D and 3D, and its camera system, saying \\"Thankfully the transition from one plane to another is pretty seamless and isn't the bothersome chore that switches in X7 were. It's an easy and totally acceptable gameplay method and one that should have been used in 2003 to begin with.\\" GameSpot criticized the game for its level design, which often made the game extremely frustrating to play. They also derided the story, remarking that it \\"dabbles in a lot of nonsensical anime-style ramblings about things that are of little importance to the actual game.\\" According to Famitsu, Mega Man X8 was the tenth best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 14,927 units. A total of 35,546 units were sold in the region by the end of 2005.

The seven-year contract to run the Connexions Card was won by Capita, signed in July 2001, and operated as a Public-Private Partnership with a budget of ¬£109million. The scheme flopped and was sunsetted in the summer of 2006 with a saving of ¬£23million. Over the course of its operation, from its roll-out in early 2002 to its conclusion, one million cards had been issued but only 145,947 had ever been used.

An official evaluation of the programme completed in September 2004 concluded that the programme had fallen far short of its aims (e.g. 1.7 million young people using the card in a steady state) and there was no clear evidence of a direct impact on attitudes to attendance, learning or career choices. Indeed, the only young people to use the cards were those who didn't have a problem in the first place. The inflexible contract with Capita was also singled out as a barrier to targeting the product more effectively. And, as predicted, the system where students had to swipe their cards through a reader connected to Capita's central database at the beginning of every lesson (in addition to the school keeping its own attendance register) was a disaster.

It is the first title of the Mega Man Battle Network series of games. It was originally released in Japan as a GBA launch game on March 21, 2001 and was released later that year in North America and Europe. It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on July 9, 2014, in Europe on July 24, 2014, and in North America on July 31, 2014. Battle Network takes place during the 21st century in a world where society and everyday life is driven by the internet. Users are able to interact with and virtually explore nearly any electronic device using highly advanced, online avatars called \\"NetNavis\\". The game follows a young boy named Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE as they solve a series of crimes instigated by the \\"WWW (World Three)\\" organization. Rather than share the platform gameplay of its predecessors, Battle Network is a tactical role-playing game (RPG) in which the player respectively controls Lan in the game's outside world and MegaMan.EXE in its virtual world. Battles take place in real-time; special abilities called \\"Battle Chips\\" can be accessed to fight off the numerous computer viruses present in the game's cyberspace environments. Battle Network was created amidst the rise of collectible card games, as shown by its collectible Battle Chips that are used to create \\"Folders\\" (like card decks). According to producer Keiji Inafune, the development team wanted Battle Network to identify specifically with younger gamers by creating a setting resembling the real world and a gameplay model that mixes traditional action and RPG elements. Battle Network received positive reviews from critics. Its unconventional combat system was given significant praise and its presentation was well-regarded. However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media. Plot Mega Man Battle Network is set in an ambiguous year in the 21st century (\\"20XX AD\\") in an alternate reality to the original Mega Man series. Within the world of Battle Network, the Net has become humanity's primary means of communication, commerce, and even crime. Users are able to \\"jack in\\" to the Net and other computerized devices, and explore their various aspects using program avatars called \\"NetNavis (Network Navigators)\\" as if they were physical locations. The Net and the inner workings of computers are displayed as a virtual world with which computer programs of all varieties, as personified in a humanoid form, can interact. Users often do so by accessing their NetNavis via a \\"PET (PErsonal information Terminal)\\" device. The plot of Mega Man Battle Network follows one such pair, Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. Lan is a fifth grader in the town of ACDC. His father, Dr. Yuichiro Hikari, is one of the world's top scientists and NetNavi researchers. Not long into the story, Lan and MegaMan.EXE take it upon themselves to solve various criminal cases around ACDC involving other Navis and their operators. Some of the confrontations with the various criminals involve desperate, life-threatening situations including a bus rigged to explode, oxygen being cut off at a large party, the entire city's clean water freezing, and school students being re-educated as mindless slaves. The duo continuously crosses paths with Eugene Chaud, an official \\"NetBattler\\" commissioned by the government to investigate crimes on the Net. Chaud and his NetNavi ProtoMan.EXE act as rivals to Lan and MegaMan.EXE. The protagonists eventually learn that the criminals are all connected to an organization called the \\"WWW (World Three)\\". The WWW intentionally infects computer networks with computer viruses so as to hinder their normal operations and hack vital information. The group is led by Dr. Wily, a former colleague of Lan's grandfather. While working together, Wily had specialized in robotics while Lan's grandfather specialized in networks, which eventually led to NetNavis. The government cut Wily's funding, opting instead to pursue Hikari's NetNavi project. Wily's goal throughout the game is to collect four super programs with which the \\"LifeVirus\\" may be constructed. The LifeVirus is a nearly indestructible virus capable of wiping out the Net and all associated devices. The protagonists infiltrate the WWW, but MegaMan.EXE becomes disabled. Chaud arrives and gives Lan a batch file from Dr. Hikari to restore his Navi. After receiving the file \\"Hub.bat\\", Lan questions his father about the name. It is revealed the MegaMan.EXE is actually a unique Navi made by Lan's father. When Lan's twin brother, Hub, died at a young age, Dr. Hikari transferred Hub's consciousness into the NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. This created a special physical and virtual bond between the two brothers. In the end, Lan and MegaMan.EXE manage to defeat Wily, destroy the LifeVirus, and restore peace to ACDC. Gameplay Battles take place on a three-by-six grid. The player selects a Cannon Battle Chip for MegaMan.EXE (left) while fighting two viruses. Unlike the previous action-platformer entries of the Mega Man franchise, Mega Man Battle Network is a real-time tactical RPG. To progress through the game the player must alternately navigate the outside world as Lan Hikari and the Net as MegaMan.EXE, each containing certain tasks that must be completed to allow advancement in the other. Controlling Lan, the player may travel around the world map, interact with non-player characters, check email, purchase items, initiate Net missions, or speak with MegaMan.EXE through his PET. In contrast with traditional Mega Man entries in which battle and movement through the levels happen in the same setting, Battle Networks combat occurs only through by battling computer viruses within the Net. This cyber world is represented by a series of branching pathways and nodes, where MegaMan.EXE can travel to both new and previously visited locations, find and purchase items, and fight viruses. Battles do not generally appear on the field screen of the Net but are usually set as random encounters. The battlefield itself is made up of 18 tiles divided into two groups of nine, one group being space in which MegaMan.EXE may freely move and the other group being space inhabited by enemies. Akin to other Mega Man games, MegaMan.EXE possesses an arm cannon called the \\"Mega Buster\\". The player can transition among the nine provided tiles and fire the Mega Buster at enemies from across the screen. The objective of each battle is to delete all the viruses by reducing their hit points (HP) to zero. If MegaMan.EXE's own health depletes, a game over occurs. Certain power-up programs can be found that upgrade MegaMan.EXE's HP, defense, or Mega Buster power. The Mega Buster is quite weak on its own, so in order to delete viruses more efficiently, the player must access special abilities called \\"Battle Chips\\". These are minor programs that contain data that the Navi can utilize to perform more powerful attacks, summon other Navis for help, or execute supportive actions such as restoring HP or destroying tiles on the enemies' side of the battlefield. Battle Chips are uploaded to MegaMan.EXE by Lan's PET in a process called \\"Customization.\\" Each turn in battle presents the player with five random chips from which to choose, though the player is limited to chips of the same variety or chips with the same alphabetic code. Once the \\"Battle Gauge\\" (or \\"Custom Gauge\\") at the top of the screen fills during battle, another random set of chips can be chosen from a general pool called the \\"folder\\". At any given time, the player may only have exactly 30 chips in the folder from which the Customization process may draw. The player is only allowed to carry up to ten of the same kind of chip and up to five Navi-summon chips in the folder. However, a player may possess any number of other chips in inactive reserve, called the \\"sack\\", which may be moved to the active folder outside of battle. Every chip and enemy is aligned to one of five elements: Neutral, Fire, Water, Electric, and Wood. If MegaMan.EXE hits an enemy with an attack aligned to an element they are weak against, the attack will do double damage. Battle Network features a very limited multiplayer option. Up to two players may connect with each other using a Game Link Cable and then give or trade Battle Chips. Players may also engage in battles with one another. The \\"test battle\\" mode has no stakes whereas the \\"real battle\\" mode allows the winning player to take a battle chip from the loser. Development and release Initially conceptualized with the intention of being a horror game, Mega Man Battle Network was developed by Capcom Production Studio 2 amidst the success of Nintendo's portable RPG franchise Pok√©mon. Rather than extend upon the traditional action-platform formula for the Mega Man series as they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, Capcom followed Nintendo's example on the latter's then-newest handheld console, the GBA. While creating Battle Network, director Masahiro Yasuma found difficulty in blending action attributes with \\"the kind of fun you get from a Pok√©mon game\\" in order to make it enjoyable, new, and fresh. Yasuma recalled that production was further challenged because no effective precursor of its type had been made before. Producer Keiji Inafune stated that the development team wanted to add a \\"real world\\" feel to the Mega Man series by placing the protagonist of Battle Network in a location where the internet is prevalent. With the release of the portable GBA, the team felt that they should target modern gamers, specifically children, as an audience for the new series. The developers thought such a theme would be both successful and relevant because these younger gamers grew up with and utilized such technology on a daily basis. To ensure the game's popularity, Capcom marketed Battle Network alongside an afternoon anime adaptation, emphasized head-to- head matches between players, and provided fans with exclusive content via special events. Inafune credited himself for redesigning the protagonist Mega Man as MegaMan.EXE for the Battle Network series, though he recounted the character designers were reluctant to hand over the responsibility to him and even altered his illustrations afterwards. The character's initial concept art went through a large number of changes before it was finalized to a much simpler design, so that even very young fans could easily draw it. Yuji Ishihara acted as a primary character artist for the game. Each of the game's boss characters was designed so that their bodies would exude a certain motif; for example, StoneMan.EXE was meant to look like a huge castle made from stone masonry. Some bosses resembled their original Mega Man series counterparts while others were a large departure from these more humanoid appearances. Ishihara explained that the artists chose size and shape variety among the characters to \\"provide a little bit of surprise and excitement\\" to fans familiar with their classic forms. The musical score for Battle Network was composed by Akari Kaida, who would later work on the fifth installment of the series. All 22 musical tracks for Mega Man Battle Network were included on the Rockman EXE 1 ~ 3 Game Music Collection, released in Japan by Suleputer on December 18, 2002. The Japanese version of Battle Network was first announced in August 2000 as one of four games set to be released for the recently unveiled GBA. A demo of the game was promoted at Nintendo Space World that month, where it was displayed on only two out of the 140 playable consoles. The game was displayed on five kiosks at the Tokyo Game Show the following month. According to series planners Masakazu Eguchi and Masahiro Yasuma, this beta build of the game involved the player fighting a malevolent WoodMan.EXE within the school's electronic blackboard. Battle Network was officially released in Japan as a GBA launch title on March 21, 2001. A television advertisement of the game featured the song \\"Neo Venus\\" by Japanese rock band Janne Da Arc. The English localization of Battle Network was announced on May 17, 2001, just prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game was released in North America and Europe on October 31 and November 30 respectively. Ubisoft published Mega Man Battle Network in PAL regions as part of a seven-GBA game licensing agreement with Capcom. Its first sequel, Mega Man Battle Network 2, was announced before the Japan World Hobby Fair in June 2001. Attendees to the fair were able to download chip data for the character Bass.EXE into their original Battle Network cartridges. Reception and legacy Mega Man Battle Network has been generally well-received, holding aggregates score of 80% on GameRankings and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic. The graphics of Battle Network were overall favored by reviewers. IGN's Craig Harris, GameSpy contributor James Fudge, and Kristian Brogger of Game Informer were all impressed by the game's crisp, colorful style and futuristic locales. As far as the sound was concerned, Justin Speer of GameSpot opined that the music appropriately matched the rich visuals. Brogger otherwise accepted the sound as \\"enough [...] to get by\\", but that nothing would be missed if it were turned off. Harris comparably stated that \\"the standard Japanese tunage could have been given a bit more variety\\". The reviewers gave mixed opinions of the game's storyline. Though Brogger called it \\"engrossing\\", Harris recognized the plot as the game's one major fault, describing it as \\"kiddy\\" and disliking the consistent use of computer terminology for character names. Speer similarly summarized, \\"If there's something that might hold you back from enjoying the game, it's the lighthearted and somewhat goofy story. However, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, so neither should you.\\" The battle system of Battle Network was a positive stand-out aspect for many critics. In his Battle Network series decade retrospective, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the first game suffered from terrible plotting, unbalanced play design, and unattractive and annoying environment navigation. Still, Parish perceived the game's combat mechanics to be its sole reason for success, marrying the original Mega Man action qualities with an RPG structure and requiring \\"a combination of sharp thinking and quick reflexes\\" on the player's part. Speer found battle within the game to rightfully capture the spirit of Mega Man as its \\"most original and compelling feature\\". Harris likewise regarded the battle interface to be well-designed, a refreshing change from traditional Japanese RPGs, what gives the game its charm, and a very appreciative addition to the game's limited multiplayer mode. Fudge summarized the combat as \\"very easy to learn, but difficult to master -- and yet very satisfying\\". He admitted that the random encounters can occasionally be overwhelming. Brogger considered the gameplay both deep and simple to pick up on, but thought the menu system to be \\"clunky\\" at times and its battles to be repetitive. Mega Man Battle Network entered Japanese sales charts at number 12, selling approximately 43,048 units during its first week. A total of 224,837 units were sold in Japan during 2001, with the game being listed by Dengeki Online as the 50th best-selling video game in the region for that year. The success of Mega Man Battle Network led to several sequels and spin-offs on other consoles, mobile phones, and arcade; an anime series; and numerous pieces of merchandise. A successor series called Mega Man Star Force began in 2006 after the Capcom decided to stop developing new Battle Network titles. Rockman EXE Operate Shooting Star, a remake of the first Battle Network game for the Nintendo DS, was released in 2009 and integrated elements from the Star Force series.

Biography Francis Lodwick was a merchant of Flemish origin who lived in London. His name appears in A Collection of the Names of the Merchants living in and about the City of London (1677), with the address \\"Fan-church street\\" (Fenchurch Street). He did not have any higher education and was admitted as a Fellow to the Royal Society at the age of 60. John Aubrey (1626‚Äì1697) reported that there was a group of men taking up the task of constructing a philosophical language left unfinished by John Wilkins (d. 1672). This group included Lodwick, besides Andrew Paschall (c. 1630‚Äìc. 1696), Thomas Pigott, Robert Hooke and John Ray, the latter being former members of Wilkin's original committee. Lodwick had been working on a universal alphabet for some time, and Wilkins had borrowed some of Lodwick's papers for his 1668 Essay. Hooke notes in his diary for 12 November 1673 that Lodwick had lent him a revised version of his universal alphabet. For 10 July 1675, Hooke notes that Lodwick had discussed the universal character with him and on 28 that he (Hooke) himself had written in the character. The group maintained correspondence until at least 1682.Joseph L. Subbiondo, John Wilkins and 17th-Century British Linguistics, John Benjamins Publishing (1992), 352f. Lodwick's alphabet consists of a system of representing consonants systematically; symbols indicating place of articulation (labial, dental, palatal, velar, sibilant) are modified by indication of the manner of articulation (voiced, voiceless, aspirated, nasal). Vowels are added as diacritics. This approach is entirely parallel to the tengwar alphabet, developed by J. R. R. Tolkien in the 1930s.Jim Allan, An Introduction to Elvish (1978). Dimitra Fimi, Tolkien, Race and Cultural History (2009:112). Lodwick may have been acquainted with Daniel Defoe. Francis' nephew Charles Lodwik (1658‚Äì1724), Mayor of New York City in 1694, signed at Defoe's marriage as a witness, and Francis may have introduced Defoe to \\"Roscommon's Academy\\", a group founded by Lord Roscommon in 1683.Maximillian E.

Formerly it was published under the Marvel Knights imprint (as Marvel Knights Spider-Man, vol. 1, issues #1‚Äì22). The underlying difference between this title and the other Spider-Man titles was that Marvel Knights Spider-Man was done with a more mature slant (in style if not content), thus the \\"Marvel Knights\\" prefix. Intended to replace the canceled Spider-Man's Tangled Web series, Marvel Knights Spider-Man was originally supposed to be written by Kevin Smith, but due to scheduling problems he was replaced by Mark Millar. When Millar completed his year-long story arc, he was followed by writer Reginald Hudlin. With the consolidation of the Marvel Knights line,\\"MARVEL KNIGHTS REDEFINED\\". Marvel Comics. 21 November 2005 Marvel Knights Spider-Man was renamed The Sensational Spider-Man as of issue 23. At this time, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa took over writing duties on the book. The Sensational Spider-Man was canceled after issue 41. Following Joseph Michael Straczynski and Joe Quesada's \\"One More Day\\" storyline the series was canceled to allow The Amazing Spider-Man to be published three times a month starting in 2008. A second volume of Marvel Knights: Spider-Man, written by Matt Kindt, was published as a limited series in late 2013 and early 2014. Storylines =\\"Down Among the Dead Men\\" (issues 1‚Äì4)= *Writer: Mark Millar *Penciler: Terry Dodson *Inker: Rachel Dodson When Spider-Man finally sends the Green Goblin to jail, an unknown enemy, knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, kidnaps Aunt May. After an embarrassing trip to the Avengers, Spidey visits the Owl, who says that Electro and the Vulture kidnapped her. This turns out to be a ploy by the Owl, who is after the two villains for stealing from him. Spidey goes through a brutal fight with a newly powered up Electro and is hospitalized. He is photographed (with most of his mask torn away) and is ambushed by the Vulture, only to be saved by the Black Cat who leaves Vulture in a bad physical condition due to her foul mood at the time of their fight. The photos are brought to J. Jonah Jameson, who says he thinks the partial face looks familiar. Also in the panel (#4) where a wounded Peter is climbing up an office building three characters are visible bearing a striking resemblance to Clark Kent, Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane. On the side of the computer there is a note from a man named \\"Perry\\" and a picture of an \\"S\\" symbol. =\\"Venomous\\" (issues 5‚Äì8)= *Writer: Mark Millar *Penciler: Terry Dodson and Frank Cho *Inker: Rachel Dodson The pictures of the unmasked Spider-Man are published by the Daily Bugle, but Parker's face is too mangled to be identified. Jameson issues a $5 million reward for Spidey's alias. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus goes on a rampage and Eddie Brock auctions off the Venom costume, which is bought by the Fortunato family for the baby of the family, Angelo. Spidey visits the X-Men, where Rachel Summers tells him she thinks Aunt May is dead. Parker goes to his high school reunion and is attacked by Venom. During a gruelling battle, the suit abandons Angelo, who falls to his death. Eddie Brock is discovered to have slit his own wrists. May's kidnapper then calls Parker and asks him to lunch. =\\"The Last Stand\\" (issues 9‚Äì12)= *Writer: Mark Millar *Penciler: Terry Dodson *Inker: Rachel Dodson The kidnapper turns out to be the Scorpion, who is working for Norman Osborn. They blackmail Spidey to break Norman out of jail for his Aunt's safety, and after apologising to his Uncle Ben at his grave, he goes through with it. During the breakout, Spidey (along with the Black Cat) is attacked by the new Sinister 12, which includes the Scorpion as the new Venom. The 12, with the exclusion of the Goblin and Venom, battle the two heroes until many of the Marvel heroes come to save the day. Spidey chases after the Goblin, but is ambushed by Venom, whom he defeats. Spidey finds the Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge with his wife, Mary Jane Watson. The two battle, but are interrupted by Doctor Octopus, who has been brainwashed to kill the Goblin by a shadowy organization. Spidey defeats them both, saves MJ, and rescues his Aunt, who is buried alive and unharmed in the grave of his Uncle Ben. =\\"Wild Blue Yonder\\" (issues 13‚Äì18)= *Writer: Reginald Hudlin *Penciler: Billy Tan *Inker: Jonathan Sibal After all the trauma of finding Aunt May and once again defeating the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is now a full member of the Avengers, living in Stark Tower with Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson. His summer-school job falls through, so he looks to the Daily Bugle for work. The Owl has placed a bounty on Spider-Man and the Absorbing Man and his unnamed female consultant are looking to collect. After a fight the unnamed woman stole Peter's wallet and starts looking for him at Aunt May and Peter's houses which are destroyed, so they leave none-the-wiser. At the Daily Bugle, Peter meets the new star reporter from Iowa, named Ethan Edwards. Ethan had amazing powers such as flight, super human strength, ability to see in every light spectrum, energy projection and even healing powers. Ethan's fundamentalist parents raised him to believe that \\"with power there must also come great responsibility\\" in life. Ethan asks Peter to train him and Peter agrees, so he takes him with the Fantastic Four to run some tests, which later on lead him to discover what he really is. Meanwhile, the Absorbing Man was critically wounded by the Punisher shortly after escaping from a robbery, and turns into steel to avoid bleeding to death. He absorbs the properties of cocaine (actually an unnamed drug, but the reference is clear enough) so the slug can be removed. The Owl's men use a high-powered electric fan to blow the Absorbing Man apart after he had turned into cocaine. The cocaine remains of the Absorbing Man are sold on the streets, and the users temporarily gain the powers of the Absorbing Man. =\\"The Other\\" (issues 19‚Äì22)= *Writer: Peter David, Reginald Hudlin, J. Michael Straczynski *Penciler: Pat Lee *Inker: Dream Engine These issues are part of the twelve-part crossover, Spider-Man: The Other, one-third of which is told in Marvel Knights: Spider-Man (the other two-thirds told in Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man). The second chapter of The Other, \\"Denial\\", focuses on Mary Jane, who overhears that Spider-Man might be getting killed on television. She rushes to a bar to see the live coverage on TV, and she sees Spider-Man fighting Tracer, who is controlling Iron Man's armor and forcing him to attack Spider-Man. Later, at home, Mary Jane confronts Peter, telling him she thinks he has a death wish, but Peter interrupts her to tell her the news from the doctor. The fifth chapter of The Other, \\"Retreat\\", Peter, Mary Jane and Aunt May go to Latveria to use Dr. Doom's Time Machine to see past scenes in his life, like the day Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker left Peter in the care of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. After returning to Stark Tower, Peter briefly considers a trip to Las Vegas with Mary Jane, namely in Tony Stark's penthouse suite. He ultimately rejects the idea, assuming even if he managed to win big at the blackjack tables, some super-villain or other would end up disrupting the whole vacation. Later, Morlun searches for Spider-Man, in vain, as Peter and Mary‚ÄìJane are in one of Stark's space pods, looking down upon the Earth. =\\"Feral\\" (Issues 23‚Äì27)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Angel Medina, Clayton Crain *Inker: Scott Hanna Curt Connors takes a look at \\"The Rock of Life\\" which causes a mysterious disease and causes many characters to become very angry, including Man-Wolf, Vermin, The Lizard, Black Cat, Puma and others. The Black Cat has the hardest time controlling her anger, almost killing The Lizard in a fury. Mary Jane also finds herself with a knife in a fit of rage. It is soon discovered that the rock was brought to New York by the villain Stegron with the aim of regressing all of humanity. Spider-Man, who has been able to show the most resistance to the rock, stops him. =\\"My Science Teacher is Spider-Man!!\\" (Issue 28)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Clayton Crain *Inker: Scott Hanna Due to the events in Civil War No. 2, Spider-Man has unmasked to the world. Jordan Harrison, one of Peter's students, is shocked to learn this. When Doctor Octopus discovers that Spider- Man was only fifteen when he first defeated him, he goes on a rampage through New York. Jordan Harrison distracts Doc Ock so Spidey can knock him out. This story was included in the second compilation of Civil War involving Spider- Man, entitled \\"Peter Parker, Spider-Man\\". =\\"The Deadly Foes of Peter Parker\\"(Issue 29‚Äì31)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Angel Medina *Inker: Scott Hanna Now that the world knows Spidey's identity, The Chameleon arranges his deadliest foes to go after his loved ones. Black Cat is angry that Spider-Man has gone public, but she teams up with him to stop his foes all the same. =\\"The Husband or the Spider?,\\" \\"Wounds,\\" and \\"Nothing Can Stop the Rhino\\" (Issues 32‚Äì34)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Sean Chen These three issues deal with how the women in Spider-Man's life are affected by his unmasking. The issues deal with Mary Jane Watson-Parker, Aunt May, and the Black Cat respectively. The storyline focuses on each of the women reacting to not only Peter's public unmasking, but also a brutal beating that Peter receives at the hands of the Rhino. =\\"The Strange Case Of...\\" (Issues 35‚Äì37)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Angel Medina (#35), Ramon Bachs (#36-#37) Spider-Man copycats start turning up in Manhattan, with some of them having the same powers as Peter. After Spider-Man finds one of them and sees that something is seriously wrong, he takes him to see Mr. Fantastic while Doc Connors investigates the strange fluids on a blanket the doppelganger had been in contact with. =\\"The Last Temptation of Eddie Brock\\" (Issues 38‚Äì39)= *Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa *Penciller: Lee Weeks Eddie Brock, wasting away from cancer, finds that Peter's Aunt May is in the very same hospital, and he hatches one final plan to take his revenge against Spider-Man. =\\"The Book of Peter\\" (Issue 40)= * Writer: Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa * Penciller: Clayton Crain * Peter's guilt deepens as he fears that his Aunt May will die from injuries sustained during an attack that was targeted at him. Peter reflects on the amount of death and tragedy he has encountered (Uncle Ben, Gwen Stacy, etc.) due to his leading a double-life as Spider-Man. As despair consumes him, he is visited by a mysterious stranger (God) who conveys to him that in life tragedy affects everyone in some form or another. Also, he explains that due to Spider-Man's heroic efforts, many people are alive and well, and that should bring him some comfort. While alleviating some of Peter's guilt, the information doesn't change the helplessness that Peter feels towards his situation. The story concludes with the stranger telling Peter to have faith, and that he has asked a lot more from people much closer to him, a possible reference to Jesus Christ. The last page is Peter living as an old man with his wife, giving Spider-Man a happy ending. =\\"One More Day\\" Part 3 of 4 (Issue 41)= *Writer: J.

Since she was having trouble with the birth, Mach called a veterinarian, D.L. Crump, to help. Dr. Crump tied Grady to a post so she would hold still. When he was finished taking care of her, she was untied. She then whirled around and started chasing Bill, who jumped on a pile of cottonseed sacks to escape. Grady dove for the only light in the shed, which was from the small opening to the silo; the opening was only 17 inches wide and 25 and a half inches high. Mach and Dr. Crump looked toward the silo opening and saw a few red hairs clinging to the edge of the heavy steel silo door. Grady was in the silo. The opening could not be made wider because it was encased in steel. Mach did not want to tear down the silo as it was too valuable, nor did he want to slaughter Grady, who was worth over $1,000. Bill Mach asked for help through his local newspaper, and the response was overwhelming. Mach and his brother received 5,400 letters and 700 telegrams from people from 45 states and Canada and Germany.\\"Remember her 1949 Jump?

Grady was featured in Life, TIME, and newspapers all over the country. People offered a variety of solutions for getting Grady out of the silo. The suggestions included rigging a pole to swing her out the top of the silo, tunneling under the silo, and bringing an attractive bull to the opening to lure her out. An Air Force officer said he knew of a helicopter that would lift but it was in San Marcos, Texas. Three days after Grady's leap, Bill Mach got a call from Ralph Partridge, the farming editor of The Denver Post, who told Mach he was coming to Yukon to get Grady out of the silo. Partridge supervised while a ramp was built from the floor of the silo to the opening.Guffey, Chan. \\"Bossy Slips Out,\\" The Oklahoman, February 27, 1949, p.1-2. He coated the ramp and the opening with axle grease. Partridge then smeared Grady with 10 pounds of axle grease, and she was outfitted with two heavy halters. Dr. Crumb recommended that Grady be milked before they attempted to pull her out, so J.O. Dickey Jr., Yukon vocational agriculture teacher, went in the silo and milked her.

He also worked to a lesser extent as a TV presenter, voice actor and comic writer, as well as being an original collector. At 12, he began making films with a Super-8 camera, and, after a recommendation from Fernando Trueba, began to make films in 35 mm, funded by his appearances in TV game shows. Fame would come with his first feature, Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley, to be followed by numerous sequels that would make it the highest grossing Spanish film series. Life and career Santiago was born in the Carabanchel neighbourhood in Madrid. After studying Arts at the Complutense University of Madrid, he decided to pursue a career as a filmmaker and in 1989 he directed the short Relatos de medianoche with a budget of 7000 pesetas (around US$50). In 1992 he went on to direct his first professional short Evilio, followed with Perturbado in 1993. Segura is a recurring protagonist in the works of directors Alex de la Iglesia and Guillermo del Toro. In 1993, he had a small role in Alex de la Iglesia's film Acci√≥n mutante. Two years later, he starred in El d√≠a de la Bestia, from the same director and that role made him famous in Spain. In 1998 he directed the film that brought him to stardom, Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley (1998), in which he also acted as the lead character Jos√© Luis Torrente, a sleazy crime-fighter. Its popularity led to a sequel (Torrente 2: Misi√≥n en Marbella) and a computer game (Torrente: El juego). Torrente 2: Misi√≥n en Marbella made ‚Ç¨22,838,500 at the Spanish box office, becoming the highest grossing Spanish film of all time. Torrente 3: El protector, the third film in the series, was released in September 2005. Its advertising campaign parodied Batman Begins, using the phrase \\"Torrente Acabado\\" (\\"Torrente Finished\\"). Although he declared Torrente 3: El protector would be the last of the Torrente series, Torrente 4 was released in 2011. In 2010, he played the title role in El gran V√°zquez, based on the life of the legendary cartoonist/wastrel Manuel V√°zquez Gallego. In 2014 he released Torrente V: Operaci√≥n Eurovegas with Alec Baldwin as guest star, and was the top release of 2014 in Spain. He has since made his way into American culture by making appearances in movies such as Pacific Rim, Hellboy, Hellboy II: The Golden Army and Blade II (all of them by Del Toro), Perdita Durango (by De la Iglesia), Jack and Jill and Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London. He has also dubbed video games to Spanish, like Jack Black's role in Br√ºtal Legend. Because of his success, Santiago Segura has become a producer. He owns Amiguetes Entertainment company, he is associated with the theater in Estaci√≥n del Norte in Madrid, and has produced Promedio rojo (2004) (featuring Nicol√°s L√≥pez) and Aqu√≠ mando yo... y punto com. In 2018 he appeared in the third season of MasterChef Celebrity. He was the 10th contestant to be eliminated.

Its ingredients include brandy, citrus essences, vanilla, and other secret spices. It is bottled at 70 proof (35% ABV). History The brand claims the recipe dates back to the Renaissance period. A legend claims that it was created in the 15th century for Lorenzo the Magnificent and rediscovered by brothers-in-law Gaetano Tuoni and Giorgio Canepa in 1938.Tuaca official site The liquor was first created as Brandy Milk, produced with milk, brandy and vanilla.From the newspaper Il Tirreno, July 14, 2011 Later on, milk was dropped from the recipe, and the name was changed to Tuoca. In the 1960s, Mario di Grazia, an Italian and the owner of a chain of liquor stores in San Francisco, began selling the liquor in the United States. After that, in order to make easier the pronunciation in English the name changed again to Tuaca.From the newspaper Il Tirreno, October 7, 2012 Brown-Forman of Louisville, Kentucky acquired Tuaca in 2002 then sold it to Sazerac Company in 2016.

He has written for television shows such as London's Burning, The Knock, and the BBC's Murder in Mind series. He is one of the top selling Amazon Kindle authors, the second bestselling UK author worldwide on Kindle in 2011. Biography =Early life= Leather was born in Manchester. He grew up in Sale and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and attended Manchester Grammar School. He attended Bath University, where he obtained a BSc in Biochemistry in 1978. =Early career= Leather was employed as a biochemist for ICI, shovelled limestone in a quarry, worked as a baker, a petrol pump attendant, a barman, and worked for the Inland Revenue. He began his writing career as a journalist, working for newspapers such the Glasgow Herald, Daily Mirror, The Times, Daily Mail, and the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. =Writing career= Leather began writing when he was in college; however, he \\"never managed to get beyond a few pages,\\" and did not begin writing full-time until he had worked as a journalist for more than ten years. His first novel, Pay Off, was written while he was still employed at The Daily Mirror. It was published from the \\"slush pile\\" at HarperCollins. The novel is a thriller about a merchant banker who takes revenge on two gangsters who killed his father. The book is set in Scotland, where Leather worked for five years on The Glasgow Herald as a business writer. His second novel, The Fireman, was written while he was working as the business editor of the South China Morning Post. In The Fireman, a British tabloid journalist travels to Hong Kong to discover why his sister committed suicide. Both novels, and his third, Hungry Ghost, were published by HarperCollins. Leather wrote his fourth novel, The Chinaman, while working as night news editor on the business desk of The Times in London. At the time, the Provisional Irish Republican Army's bombing campaign was at its height, and in The Chinaman, a Sino-Vietnamese man loses his family in an attack loosely based on the bombing of the Harrods department store in London. Having been turned away by the authorities, the man, a highly decorated Special Forces fighter in the Vietnam War, travels to Ireland and hunts down the people responsible. The book was used as the basis for the 2017 thriller The Foreigner. =Published works= Leather's novels frequently include themes of crime, imprisonment, military service, and terrorism. Settings are typically London and the Far East. Leather writes different series in slightly different genres. The main character of one series, Dan 'Spider' Shepherd, is a former Special Air Service soldier who becomes an undercover policeman. Another series, Jack Nightingale, is about a former police negotiator who becomes a private investigator; this supernatural detective series is also published by Hodder & Stoughton and includes the books Nightfall, Midnight, Nightmare, Nightshade and Lastnight. Leather has written screenplays for London's Burning, The Knock, and the BBC's Murder in Mind series. Two of his novels, The Stretch and The Bombmaker, were screened for made for TV movies and filmed for Sky Television. The Stretch starred Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson, two popular soap opera stars from the U.K. Amazon Kindle releases Leather became successful in the Amazon Kindle market in 2010. Amazon UK opened an eBook store that year. As reported in The Guardian, Leather anticipated that people buying eBooks would be seeking bargains, and he priced his books at the minimum price for independent writers in order to get his books into the top ten. He then marketed the books on various forums online. Early in 2011, Leather's books The Basement, Hard Landing, and the vampire novella Once Bitten occupied the top three places in the UK Kindle bestseller list, a feat matched only by Stieg Larsson with his The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. That same year, Leather was the second bestselling UK author on the Kindle worldwide, beaten only by Lee Child. Awards and recognition In 2002, Leather's book Tango One was nominated for the inaugural CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger, awarded by the Crime Writers' Association. His book Hard Landing was nominated for the award in 2004. His book Cold Kill was nominated for Best Novel in 2007 by International Thriller Writers Inc. In 2011, Leather sold over 500,000 eBooks and was voted by The Bookseller magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the UK publishing world. 2012 Harrogate Crime Writing Festival On 5 August 2012, journalist Nick Cohen wrote in The Observer that Leather had created phony Twitter accounts in the name of another writer, and used those accounts to praise Leather's own books. Cohen quoted Leather's response to a question, as a panelist, at the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival, which was recorded for BBC Radio 4: > \\"As soon as my book is out I'm on Facebook and Twitter several times a day > talking about it. I'll go on to several forums, the well-known forums, and > post there under my name and under various other names and various other > characters. You build up this whole network of characters who talk about > your books and sometimes have conversations with yourself.\\" Leather's comment was widely reported, and, on 3 September 2012, forty nine other British authors issued a group statement in which they \\"unreservedly condemn\\" the use of sockpuppets, or paid reviews. Jeremy Duns and Steve Mosby have alleged that Leather has harassed them online.

History The town is of Etruscan origin; its people are first referred to in Pliny, NH III.114 (Vettonenses), then in other ancient authors and inscriptions. View of Bettona. Bettona was once the seat of a bishopric. While legend associates two other bishops with the see, the only historically documented one is Gaudentius, who took part in a synod at Rome called by Pope Hilarius in 465.Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol.

The town was sacked in 1352 and very little remains save the churches that have since been completely updated. The town was ordered rebuilt by Cardinal Albornoz who built a small rocca where the Church of San Crispolto stands. (Cardinal Albornoz is also responsible for the roccas at Assisi, Spoleto, and Orvieto among others.) The remains of a draw bridge can be found in a piazza now used for parking near the town's rear gate, Porta Romana. The Pinacoteca Comunale in the Palazzetto del Podest√† (1371) has a painting by Perugino, the Madonna of Mercy, as well as other works by Jacopo Siculo, Dono Doni, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo and Della Robbia. Santa Maria Maggiore church, situated in the historical centre, is the main church of the Comune of Bettona. A Gothic chapel located near the nave entrance and dedicated to Saint Rita, is the only remaining part of the original church. The main altar is in the shape of domed temple, by Cruciano Egiduzio. The apse was frescoed in 1939 by the futurist painter Gerardo Dottori. The church of San Crispolto was erected by monks to preserve the body of the patron saint (8th century). The current fa√ßade is by Antonio Stefanucci. In the ‚ÄúOratorio of St. Andrea‚Äù is a series of paintings from the school of Giotto, dated 1394, which show the Passion of Christ rediscovered during a 1980s restoration.

Werder was born in Schlo√überg near Norkitten in the Province of East Prussia. He entered the Prussian Gardes du Corps in 1825, transferring the following year into the Guard Infantry, with which he served for many years as a subaltern. In 1839 he was appointed an instructor in the Cadet Corps, and later he was employed in the topographical bureau of the Great General Staff. In 1842-1843 he took part in the Russian operations in the Caucasus, and on his return to Germany in 1846, was placed, as a captain, on the staff. In 1848 he married. Regimental and staff duty alternately occupied him until 1863, when he was made major-general, and given the command of a brigade of Guard Infantry. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Werder greatly distinguished himself at Gitschin and K√∂niggratz at the head of the 3rd Division. He returned home with the rank of lieutenant-general and the Order Pour le M√©rite. In 1870, at first employed with the 3rd Army Headquarters and in command of the W√ºrttemberg and Baden forces, he was after the Battle of W√∂rth entrusted with the operations against Strasbourg, which he captured after a long and famous siege. Promoted general of infantry, and assigned to command the new XIVth Army Corps, Werder defeated the French at Dijon and at Nuits, and, when Charles-Denis Bourbaki's army moved forward to relieve Belfort, turned upon him and fought the desperate action of Battle of Villersexel, which enabled him to cover the Germans besieging Belfort. On 15, 16 and 17 January 1871, Werder with greatly inferior forces succeeded in holding his own on the Battle of the Lisaine against all Bourbaki's efforts to reach Belfort, a victory which aroused great enthusiasm in southern Germany. In the course of this ethustiastic prevailing mood a monument, the Siegesdenkmal, was erected in Freiburg im Breisgau to honor his services and the victory of the German people in the Franco-Prussian War. After the war Werder commanded the Baden forces, now called the XlVth Army Corps, until he retired in 1879. On his retirement he was raised to the dignity of count. He died in 1887 at Gr√ºssow in Pomerania. The 30th (4th Rhenish) Infantry regiment carried his name, and there is a statue of Werder at Freiburg im Breisgau.

It was filmed at Shepperton Studios, London, with some location work at Osterley House in Middlesex. Although based on Conan Doyle's characters, the story is an original one, which has the famous detective on the trail of Jack the Ripper. The story of A Study in Terror challenges Sherlock Holmes to solve these horrific crimes. This leads Holmes through a trail of aristocracy, blackmail and family insanity. Unlike Scotland Yard, and the real-life story, Holmes eventually discovers the true identity of the Ripper. The film had its world premiere at the Leicester Square Theatre in the West End of London on 4 November 1965.The Times 4 November 1965, page 2 A Study in Terror presents the first film appearance of Mycroft Holmes. Plot In the dark alleys of London, the notorious Jack the Ripper is committing a series of gruesome murders. Holmes and Watson, already intrigued by reports of the Jack the Ripper murders, become involved when they receive a parcel from Whitechapel containing a case of surgical instruments with the scalpel, possibly the murder weapon, missing. By a family crest on the box, they come into contact with the Duke of Shires who admits his elder son Michael Osborne dreamed of becoming a doctor. His younger son, Lord Carfax, tells them Michael has disappeared. Holmes deduces the instruments were pawned to a broker, Joseph Beck, who tells them that he received them from an Angela Osborne, who gave her address as a soup kitchen run by Doctor Murray. Holmes and Watson meet Murray, also a police pathologist, after convincing Lestrade to let them view the body of the most recent victim, Annie Chapman. Holmes convinces Watson to go to the soup kitchen and make a fuss of looking for Angela. A disguised Holmes then follows Murray's niece Sally when she goes to meet Carfax. They explain Carfax was blackmailed by a man who threatened to tell his father that Michael, who was helping Murray at the soup kitchen, had married a prostitute. Carfax now works there himself but Michael was gone before he and Sally arrived. The blackmailer, Max Steiner, now runs a local public house. The Prime Minister asks Mycroft Holmes to persuade his brother to investigate the Ripper case, unaware that he is already involved. Holmes and Watson nearly catch the Ripper when he kills another prostitute who invites him into her room. Holmes confronts Murray who explains that Michael had learned that Angela had assisted Steiner with the blackmail. During an altercation between the three of them, Angela was disfigured when acid was thrown in her face. Murray also reveals his crippled and mentally disabled assistant is Michael, the result of a brutal beating from Steiner. Holmes and Watson discover Angela in the upper room of Steiner's inn and she admits that she sent them the surgical instruments, having removed the scalpel herself, to get them involved. Holmes and Watson return Michael to his family. During the night, Holmes discovers Carfax attempting to kill Angela in her room; he is the Ripper. The pub catches alight during a struggle; Carfax, Steiner and Angela are all killed in the blaze but Holmes escapes. He explains to Watson that Carfax had no way of identifying Angela so he killed every prostitute that he came across in the hope that one of them would be her. With all those involved dead, Holmes elects to keep the truth from the police. Cast Sir Nigel Films The movie was from Sir Nigel Films, a company set up by the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with the aim of exploiting Doyle's literary works in film and television. Henry Lester, managing director of Sir Nigel said \\"We felt that the royalties we were receiving from various media outlets bore little relation to profits. Also we were not pleased with the quality of some of the films.\\" Doyle's son Arthur was chairman of the board on the company.Conan Doyle's Estate Is Turning Film Producer: Search for Profits, Not Just Royalties, Inspires Sir Nigel Films Ltd. By VINCENT CANBY. New York Times 27 Jan 1966: 29. In 1963 the Mirisch Company obtained the rights to make The Life of Sherlock Holmes. However when that project was delayed, the Mirischs gave permission for Sir Nigel to make A Study in Terror and one more film. A Study in Terror was a co production between Sir Nigel Films and Britain's Compton Group, and American producer Herman Cohen. Sir Nigel were entitled to fifty percent of the profits. In 1966 Sir Nigel had plans for five movies and a television series. Production =Development= According to producer Herman Cohen, he had been thinking of making a movie about Sherlock Holmes, and so had the producing team of Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser. They decided to team up and Cohen arranged for finance through Columbia. Weaver p 14 Cohen says the idea of combining Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper came from Donald and Derek Ford, who wrote the first draft. Cohen was not happy with it and arranged for a rewrite from Harry Craig, who Arthur Conan Doyle and Henry Lester liked. Craig was not credited on the final film.Weaver p 14 Cohen says Arthur Doyle had little involvement in the movie apart from visiting the set but Lester was involved in many discussions. Cohen says, \\"There were several things we wanted to do that he would say. ‚ÄúOh, no. no. Sherlock Holmes wouldn't do that!‚Äù\\"Weaver p 14 =Shooting= The film was shot at Shepperton Studios. Cohen says he had to direct the fire sequence because director James Hill went missing. \\"Hill had a habit of disappearing,\\" said the producer. \\"He was a nice guy, but strange. Nobody could get close to him. And he was always fidgety and very nervous.\\"Weaver p 15 Release Producer Herman Cohen originally wanted to title the film Fog but Columbia insisted on the title A Study in Terror to tie in with the Sherlock Holmes novel A Study in Scarlet. Cohen also recalled on its US release Columbia advertised the film as a then- popular tongue in cheek Batman-type film rather than a horror or detective film. =Box Office= Cohen said the film was a bigger hit in Europe than the US, which he attributed in part to the fact that he, not Columbia, handled the ad campaign.Weaver p 16 Reception =Critical= The Monthly Film Bulletin gave a lackluster review saying \\"the film marks time lamely in the intervals between its conventionally shock-cut murders, while John Neville and Donald Houston uncomfortably mouth their lines as if suspecting that nobody will listen.\\" Variety felt that \\"though the mixture of fiction and fact doesn't entirely click...An excellent cast gives the production fill value.\\" The New York Times said \\"the entire cast, director and writers do play their roles well enough to make wholesale slaughter a pleasant diversion.\\" Post-release history In 1966, the film was made into a novel by Ellery Queen and Paul W. Fairman. The novelisation is unusual in that it adds a framing story wherein Ellery Queen reads a manuscript that re-tells the actions of the film. The framing story was written by Ellery Queen and the novelisation of the film itself by Fairman. The Holmes-Ripper idea was later taken up in Murder by Decree (1978), in which Frank Finlay reprised his role as Lestrade and Anthony Quayle once again had an important part (though this time as Sir Charles Warren of Scotland Yard). The film inspired the writing of Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds (1975), blending the story of Sherlock Holmes and the world of H.G. Wells' science fiction novel The War of the Worlds. Soundtrack A Study in Terror (1965) was composed by John Scott in his first feature film score conducting the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra (HSO 333).

Many types of radio transmissions depend, to varying degrees, on line of sight (LOS) between the transmitter and receiver. Obstacles that commonly cause NLOS conditions include buildings, trees, hills, mountains, and, in some cases, high voltage electric power lines. Some of these obstructions reflect certain radio frequencies, while some simply absorb or garble the signals; but, in either case, they limit the use of many types of radio transmissions, especially when low on power budget. Lower power levels at a receiver reduce the chance of successfully receiving a transmission. Low levels can be caused by at least three basic reasons: low transmit level, for example Wi-Fi power levels; far-away transmitter, such as 3G more than away or TV more than away; and obstruction between the transmitter and the receiver, leaving no clear path. NLOS lowers the effective received power. Near Line Of Sight can usually be dealt with using better antennas, but Non Line Of Sight usually requires alternative paths or multipath propagation methods. How to achieve effective NLOS networking has become one of the major questions of modern computer networking. Currently, the most common method for dealing with NLOS conditions on wireless computer networks is simply to circumvent the NLOS condition and place relays at additional locations, sending the content of the radio transmission around the obstructions. Some more advanced NLOS transmission schemes now use multipath signal propagation, bouncing the radio signal off other nearby objects to get to the receiver. Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) is a term often used in radio communications to describe a radio channel or link where there is no visual line of sight (LOS) between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. In this context LOS is taken * Either as a straight line free of any form of visual obstruction, even if it is actually too distant to see with the unaided human eye * As a virtual LOS i.e., as a straight line through visually obstructing material, thus leaving sufficient transmission for radio waves to be detected There are many electrical characteristics of the transmission media that affect the radio wave propagation and therefore the quality of operation of a radio channel, if it is possible at all, over an NLOS path. The acronym NLOS has become more popular in the context of wireless local area networks (WLANs) and wireless metropolitan area networks such as WiMAX because the capability of such links to provide a reasonable level of NLOS coverage greatly improves their marketability and versatility in the typical urban environments where they are most frequently used. However NLOS contains many other subsets of radio communications. The influence of a visual obstruction on a NLOS link may be anything from negligible to complete suppression. An example might apply to a LOS path between a television broadcast antenna and a roof mounted receiving antenna. If a cloud passed between the antennas the link could actually become NLOS but the quality of the radio channel could be virtually unaffected. If, instead, a large building was constructed in the path making it NLOS, the channel may be impossible to receive. Beyond Line-Of- Sight (BLOS) is a related term often used in the military to describe radio communications capabilities that link personnel or systems too distant or too fully obscured by terrain for LOS communications. These radios utilize active repeaters, groundwave propagation, tropospheric scatter links, and ionospheric propagation to extend communication ranges from a few miles to a few thousand miles. Radio waves as plane electromagnetic waves From Maxwell's equationsPozar, David M. (2005); Microwave Engineering, Third Edition (Intl. Ed.); John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; pp 5-9. . we find that radio waves, as they exist in free space in the far field or Fraunhofer region behave as plane waves.Ramo, Whinnery and Van Duzer;\\"Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics\\"; John Wiley & Sons, Inc; pp 322-324. Morton, A H; \\"Advanced Electrical Engineering\\"; Pitman Publishing Ltd.; pp 387-389. . In plane waves the electric field, magnetic field and direction of propagation are mutually perpendicular.A. J. Baden Fuller;\\"Microwaves, Second Edition\\"; Pergammon Press; p 47. . To understand the various mechanisms that allow successful radio communications over NLOS paths we must consider how such plane waves are affected by the object or objects that visually obstruct the otherwise LOS path between the antennas. It is understood that the terms radio far field waves and radio plane waves are interchangeable. What is line-of-sight? By definition, line of sight is the visual line of sight, that is determined by the ability of the average human eye to resolve a distant object. Our eyes are sensitive to light but optical wavelengths are very short compared to radio wavelengths. Optical wavelengths range from about 400 nanometer (nm) to 700 nm but radio wavelengths range from approximately 1 millimetre (mm) at 300 GHz to 30 kilometres (km) at 10 kHz. Even the shortest radio wavelength is therefore about 2000 times longer than the longest optical wavelength. For typical communications frequencies up to about 10 GHz, the difference is on the order of 60,000 times so it is not always reliable to compare visual obstructions, such as might suggest a NLOS path, with the same obstructions as they might affect a radio propagation path. NLOS links may either be simplex (transmission is in one direction only), duplex (transmission is in both directions simultaneously) or half-duplex (transmission is possible in both directions but not simultaneously). Under normal conditions, all radio links, including NLOSl are reciprocal‚Äîwhich means that the effects of the propagation conditions on the radio channel are identical whether it operates in simplex, duplex, or half-duplex.Ramo, Whinnery and Van Duzer (op. cit); pp 717-719. However, propagation conditions on different frequencies are different, so traditional duplex with different uplink and downlink frequencies is not necessarily reciprocal. How are plane waves affected by the size and electrical properties of the obstruction? In general, the way a plane wave is affected by an obstruction depends on the size of the obstruction relative to its wavelength and the electrical properties of the obstruction. For example, a hot air balloon with multi-wavelength dimensions passing between the transmit and receive antennas could be a significant visual obstruction but is unlikely to affect the NLOS radio propagation much assuming it is constructed from fabric and full of hot air, both of which are good insulators. Conversely, a metal obstruction of dimensions comparable to a wavelength would cause significant reflections. When considering obstruction size, we assume its electrical properties are the most common intermediate or lossy type. =Obstruction Size= Broadly, there are three approximate sizes of obstruction in relationship to a wavelength to consider in a possible NLOS path‚Äîthose that are: * Much smaller than a wavelength * The same order as a wavelength * Much larger than a wavelength If the obstruction dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident plane wave, the wave is essentially unaffected. For example, low frequency (LF) broadcasts, also known as long waves, at about 200 kHz has a wavelength of 1500 m and is not significantly affected by most average size buildings, which are much smaller. If the obstruction dimensions are of the same order as a wavelength, there is a degree of diffraction around the obstruction and possibly some transmission through it. The incident radio wave could be slightly attenuated and there might be some interaction between the diffracted wavefronts. If the obstruction has dimensions of many wavelengths, the incident plane waves depend heavily on the electrical properties of the material that forms the obstruction. =Electrical properties of obstructions that may cause NLOS= The electrical properties of the material forming an obstruction to radio waves could range from a perfect conductor at one extreme to a perfect insulator at the other. Most materials have both conductor and insulator properties. They may be mixed: for example, many NLOS paths result from the LOS path being obstructed by reinforced concrete buildings constructed from concrete and steel. Concrete is quite a good insulator when dry and steel is a good conductor. Alternatively the material may be a homogeneous lossy material. The parameter that describes to what degree a material is a conductor or insulator is known as \\\\tan \\\\delta, or the loss tangent, given by :\\\\tan \\\\delta =\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\omega\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r} where :\\\\sigma is the conductivity of the material in siemens per metre (S/m) :\\\\omega=2\\\\pi f is the angular frequency of the RF plane wave in radians per second (rad/s) and f is its frequency in hertz (Hz). :\\\\epsilon_0 is the absolute permittivity of free space in farads per metre (F/m) and :\\\\epsilon_r is the relative permittivity of the material (also known as dielectric constant) and has no units. Good conductors (poor insulators) If \\\\sigma \\\\gg \\\\omega\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r the material is a good conductor or a poor insulator and substantially reflects the radio waves that are incident upon it with almost the same power.A. J. Baden Fuller (op. cit.); p152 Therefore, virtually no RF power is absorbed by the material itself and virtually none is transmitted, even if it is very thin. All metals are good conductors and there are of course many examples that cause significant reflections of radio waves in the urban environment, for example bridges, metal clad buildings, storage warehouses, aircraft and electrical power transmission towers or pylons. Good insulators (poor conductors) If \\\\sigma \\\\ll \\\\omega\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r the material is a good insulator (or dielectric) or a poor conductor and substantially transmit waves that are incident upon it. Virtually no RF power is absorbed but some can be reflected at its boundaries depending on its relative permittivity compared to that of free space, which is unity. This uses the concept of intrinsic impedance, which is described below. There are few large physical objects that are also good insulators, with the interesting exception of fresh water icebergs but these do not usually feature in most urban environments. However large volumes of gas generally behave as dielectrics. Examples of these are regions of the Earths atmosphere, which gradually reduce in density at increasing altitudes up to 10 to 20 km. At greater altitudes from about 50 km to 200 km various ionospheric layers also behave like dielectrics and are heavily dependent on the influence of the Sun. Ionospheric layers are not gases but plasmas. =Plane waves and intrinsic impedance= Even if an obstruction is a perfect insulator, it may have some reflective properties on account of its relative permittivity \\\\epsilon_r differing from that of the atmosphere. Electrical materials through which plane waves may propagate have a property called intrinsic impedance (\\\\eta) or electromagnetic impedance, which is analogous to the characteristic impedance of a cable in transmission line theory. The intrinsic impedance of a homogeneous material is given by:A. J. Baden Fuller (op. cit.); pp45-47 :\\\\eta=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0\\\\mu_r}{\\\\epsilon_0\\\\epsilon_r}} where :\\\\mu_0 is the absolute permeability in henries per metre (H/m) and is a constant fixed at 4 \\\\pi \\\\cdot 10^{-7} H/m :\\\\mu_r is the relative permeability (unitless) :\\\\epsilon_0 is the absolute permittivity in farads per metre (F/m) and is a constant fixed at 8.85 \\\\cdot 10^{-12} F/m :\\\\epsilon_r is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant (unitless) For free space \\\\mu_r = 1 and \\\\epsilon_r = 1, therefore the intrinsic impedance of free space \\\\eta_0 is given by :\\\\eta_0=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{\\\\epsilon_0}} which evaluates to approximately 377 \\\\Omega. =Reflection losses at dielectric boundaries= In an analogy of plane wave theory and transmission line theory, the definition of reflection coefficient \\\\Gamma is a measure of the level of reflection normally at the boundary when a plane wave passes from one dielectric medium to another. For example, if the intrinsic impedance of the first and second media were \\\\eta_1 and \\\\eta_2 respectively, the reflection coefficient of medium 2 relative to 1, \\\\Gamma_{21}, is given by: :\\\\Gamma_{21} = \\\\frac{\\\\eta_2-\\\\eta_1}{\\\\eta_2+\\\\eta_1} The logarithmic measure in decibels (T_r) of how the transmitted RF signal over the NLOS link is affected by such a reflection is given by: T_{ref} = 10\\\\log_{10}(1-\\\\left\\\\Gamma_{21}\\\\right^2) dB Intermediate materials with finite conductivity Most materials of the type affecting radio wave transmission over NLOS links are intermediate: they are neither good insulators nor good conductors. Radio waves incident upon an obstruction comprising a thin intermediate material are partly reflected at both the incident and exit boundaries and partly absorbed, depending on the thickness. If the obstruction is thick enough the radio wave might be completely absorbed. Because of the absorption, these are often called lossy materials, although the degree of loss is usually extremely variable and often very dependent on the level of moisture present. They are often heterogeneous and comprise a mixture of materials with various degrees of conductor and insulator properties. Such examples are hills, valley sides, mountains (with substantial vegetation) and buildings constructed from stone, brick or concrete but without reinforced steel. The thicker they are the greater the loss. For example, a wall absorbs much less RF power from a normally incident wave than a building constructed from the same material. Means of achieving non-line-of-sight transmission =Passive random reflections= Passive random reflections are achieved when plane waves are subject to one or more reflective paths around an object that makes an otherwise LOS radio path into NLOS. The reflective paths might be caused by various objects that could either be metallic (very good conductors such as a steel bridge or an airplane) or relatively good conductors to plane waves such as large expanses of concrete building sides, walls etc. Sometimes this is considered a brute force method because, on each reflection the plane wave undergoes a transmission loss that must be compensated for by a higher output power from the transmit antenna compared to if the link had been LOS. However the technique is cheap and easy to employ and passive random reflections are widely exploited in urban areas to achieve NLOS. Communication services that use passive reflections include WiFi, WiMax, WiMAX MIMO, mobile (cellular) communications and terrestrial broadcast to urban areas. =Passive repeaters= Passive repeaters may be used to achieve NLOS links by deliberately installing a precisely designed reflector at a critical position to provide a path around the obstruction. However they are unacceptable in most urban environments due to the bulky reflector requiring critical positioning at perhaps an inaccessible location or at one not acceptable to the planning authorities or the owner of the building. Passive reflector NLOS links also incur substantial loss due to the received signal being a 'double inverse-square law' function of the transmit signal, one for each hop from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna. However, they have been successfully used in rural mountainous areas to extend the range of LOS microwave links around mountains, thus creating NLOS links. In such cases the installation of the more usual active repeater was usually not possible due to problems in obtaining a suitable power supply. =Active repeaters= An active repeater is a powered piece of equipment essentially comprising a receiving antenna, a receiver, a transmitter and a transmitting antenna. If the ends of the NLOS link are at positions A and C, the repeater is located at position B where links A-B and B-C are in fact LOS. The active repeater may simply amplify the received signal and re-transmit it un-altered at either the same frequency or a different frequency. The former case is simpler and cheaper but requires good isolation between two antennas to avoid feedback, however it does mean that the end of the NLOS link at A or C does not require to change the receive frequency from that used for a LOS link. A typical application might be to repeat or re-broadcast signals for vehicles using car radios in tunnels. A repeater that changes frequency would avoid any feedback problems but would be more difficult to design and expensive and it would require a receiver to change frequency when moving from the LOS to the NLOS zone. A communications satellite is an example of an active repeater that does change frequency. Communications satellites, in most cases, are in geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles (35,000 km) above the Equator. =Groundwave propagation= Application of the Poynting Vector to vertically polarized plane waves at LF (30 kHz to 300 kHz) and VLF (3 kHz to 30 kHz) indicates that a component of the field is propagated a few metres into the surface of the Earth. The propagation is very low loss and communications over thousands of miles over NLOS links is possible. However, such low frequencies by definition (Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem) are very low bandwidth, so this type of communication is not widely used. =Tropospheric scatter links= A tropospheric scatter NLOS link typically operates at a few gigahertz using potentially very high transmit powers (typically 3 kW to 30 kW, depending on conditions), very sensitive receivers and very high gain, usually fixed, large reflector antennas. The transmit beam is directed into the troposphere just above the horizon with sufficient power flux density that gas and water vapour molecules cause scattering in a region in the beam path known as the scatter volume. Some components of the scattered energy travel in the direction of the receiver antennas and form the receive signal. Since there are very many particles to cause scattering in this region, the Rayleigh fading statistical model may usefully predict behaviour and performance in this kind of system. =Refraction through the Earth's atmosphere= The obstruction that creates an NLOS link may be the Earth itself, such as would exist if the other end of the link was beyond the optical horizon. A very useful property of the Earth's atmosphere is that, on average, the density of air gas molecules reduces as the altitude increases up to approximately 30 km. Its relative permittivity or dielectric constant reduces steadily from about 1.00536 at the Earth's surface.Tennent, R. M. (Ed.); \\"Science Data Book; The Open University; p66 To model the change in refractive index with altitude, the atmosphere may be approximated to many thin air layers, each of which has a slightly smaller refractive index than the one below. The trajectory of radio waves progressing through such an atmosphere model at each interface, is analogous to optical beams passing from one optical medium to another as predicted by Snell's Law. When the beam passes from a higher to lower refractive index it tends to get bent or refracted away from the normal at the boundary according to Snell's Law. When the curvature of the Earth is taken into account it is found that, on average, radio waves whose initial trajectory is towards the optical horizon follows a path that does not return to the Earth's surface at the horizon, but slightly beyond it. The distance from the transmit antenna to where it does return is approximately equivalent to the optical horizon, had the Earth's radius been 4/3 of its actual value. The '4/3 Earth's radius' is a useful rule of thumb to the radio communication engineers when designing such a NLOS link. The 4/3 Earth radius rule of thumb is an average for the Earth's atmosphere assuming it is reasonably homogenised, absent of temperature inversion layers or unusual meteorological conditions. NLOS links that exploit atmospheric refraction typically operate at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands, including FM and TV terrestrial broadcast services. =Anomalous propagation= The phenomenon described above that the atmospheric refractive index, relative permittivity or dielectric constant gradually reduces with increasing height is on account of the reduction of the atmospheric air density with increasing height. Air density is also a function of temperature, which ordinarily also reduces with increasing height. However, these are only average conditions; local meteorological conditions can create phenomena such as temperature inversion layers where a warm layer of air settles above a cool layer. At the interface between them exists a relatively abrupt change in refractive index from a smaller value in the cool layer to a larger value in the warm layer. By analogy with the optical Snell's Law, this can cause significant reflections of radio waves back towards the Earth's surface where they are further reflected, thus causing a ducting effect. The result is that radio waves can propagate well beyond their intended service area with less than normal attenuation. This effect is only apparent in the VHF and UHF spectra and is often exploited by amateur radio enthusiasts to achieve communications over abnormally long distances for the frequencies involved.Hutchinson, Chuck K8CH; \\"The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs 2001 78th Ed.\\";The American Radio Relay League, Inc. For commercial communication services it cannot be exploited because it is unreliable (the conditions can form and disperse in minutes) and it can cause interference well outside of the normal service area. Temperature inversion and anomalous propagation can occur at most latitudes but they are more common in tropical climates than temperate climates, usually associated with high pressure areas (anticyclones). =Ionospheric propagation= The mechanism of ionospheric propagation in supporting NLOS links is similar to that for atmospheric refraction but, in this case, the radio wave refraction occurs not in the atmosphere but in the ionosphere at much greater altitudes. Like its tropospheric counterpart, ionospheric propagation can sometimes be statistically modelled using Rayleigh fading. The ionosphere extends from altitudes of approximately 50 km to 400 km and is divided into distinct plasma layers denoted D, E, F1, and F2 in increasing altitude. Refraction of radio waves by the ionosphere rather than the atmosphere can therefore allow NLOS links of much greater distance for just one refraction path or 'hop' via one of the layers. Under certain conditions radio waves that have undergone one hop may reflect off the Earth's surface and experience more hops, so increasing the range. The positions of these and their ion densities are significantly controlled by the Sun's incident radiation and therefore change diurnally, seasonally and during Sun spot activity. The initial discovery that radio waves could travel beyond the horizon by Marconi in the early 20th century prompted extensive studies of ionospheric propagation for the next 50 years or so, which have yielded various HF link channel prediction tables and charts. Frequencies that are affected by ionospheric propagation range from approximately 500 kHz to 50 MHz but the majority of such NLOS links operate in the 'short wave' or high frequency (HF) frequency bands between 3 MHz and 30 MHz. In the latter half of the twentieth century, alternative means of communicating over large NLOS distances were developed such as satellite communications and submarine optical fiber, both of which potentially carry much larger bandwidths than HF and are much more reliable. Despite their limitations, HF communications only need relatively cheap, crude equipment and antennas so they are mostly used as backups to main communications systems and in sparsely populated remote areas where other methods of communication are not cost effective. =Finite absorption= If an object that changes a LOS link to NLOS is not a good conductor but an intermediate material, it absorbs some of the RF power incident upon it. However, if it has finite thickness the absorption is also finite and the resulting attenuation of the radio waves may be tolerable and an NLOS link may be set up using radio waves that actually pass through the material. As an example, wireless local area networks (WLANs) often use finite absorption NLOS links to communicate between a WLAN access point and WLAN client(s) in the typical office environment. The radio frequencies used, typically a few gigahertz (GHz) normally passes through a few thin office walls and partitions with tolerable attenuation. After many such walls though or after a few thick concrete or similar (non-metallic) walls the NLOS link becomes unworkable. =Other methods= Earth‚ÄìMoon‚ÄìEarth communication, Meteor burst communications, and Sporadic E propagation are also other methods of achieving communications past the radio horizon. How is positioning accuracy affected by NLOS conditions? In most of the recent localization systems, it is assumed that the received signals propagate through a LOS path. However, infringement of this assumption can result in inaccurate positioning data. For Time of Arrival based localization system, the emitted signal can only arrive at the receiver through its NLOS paths. The NLOS error is defined as the extra distance travelled by the received signal with respect to the LOS path. The NLOS error is always positively biased with the magnitude dependent on the propagation environment.

In the early 1970s Hughes branched out into acting, her first evident credit being the 1971 blaxploitation film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song whose creator Melvin Van Peebles recruited Hughes for his stage musical Don't Play Us Cheap which afforded Hughes her Broadway in 1972, which year Hughes would reprise her stage role in the play's 1972 filmation. Hughes had her second Broadway tenure in the musical Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope in which she impressed audience- member Harry Belafonte: subsequent to performing in Paul Sills' stage adaptation of Ovid's Metamorphoses at the 1973 Festival dei Due Mondi in Umbria Hughes was recruited by Belafonte to serve as second vocalist on his six-month North American tour in 1974, and then again on his eight-month global tour in 1976. After some time away from performing tending her ailing mother in Dallas, Hughes led the national touring company of Bubbling Brown Sugar from July 1977 to May 1978: also in 1978 an uncredited Hughes was featured in the chorale for the 1978 film musical The Wiz.

Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Release Engineering. IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, USA. While it is not the goal of release engineering to encumber software development with a process overlay, it is often seen as a sign of organizational and developmental maturity. Modern release engineering is concerned with several aspects of software production: ; Identifiability: Being able to identify all of the source, tools, environment, and other components that make up a particular release. ; Reproducibility: The ability to integrate source, third party components, data, and deployment externals of a software system in order to guarantee operational stability. ; Consistency: The mission to provide a stable framework for development, deployment, audit and accountability for software components. ; Agility: The ongoing research into what are the repercussions of modern software engineering practices on the productivity in the software cycle, e.g. continuous integration and push on green initiatives. Release engineering is often the integration hub for more complex software development teams, sitting at the cross between development, product management, quality assurance and other engineering efforts, also known as DevOps. Release engineering teams are often cast in the role of gatekeepers (e.g. at Facebook, Google, Microsoft) for certain critical products where their judgement forms a parallel line of responsibility and authority in relation to production releases (pushes). Frequently, tracking of changes in a configuration management system or revision control system is part of the domain of the release engineer. The responsibility for creating and applying a version numbering scheme into software‚Äîand tracking that number back to the specific source files to which it applies‚Äîoften falls onto the release engineer. Producing or improving automation in software production is usually a goal of the release engineer. Gathering, tracking, and supplying all the tools that are required to develop and build a particular piece of software may be a release engineering task, in order to reliably reproduce or maintain software years after its initial release to customers. While most software engineers, or software developers, do many or all of the above as a course of their work, in larger organizations the specialty of the release engineer can be applied to coordinate disparate source trees, projects, teams, and components. This frees the developers to implement features in the software and also frees the quality assurance engineers to more broadly and deeply test the produced software. The release engineer may provide software, services, or both to software engineering and software quality assurance teams. The software provided may build tools, assembly, or other reorganization scripts which take compilation output and place them into a pre-defined tree structure, and even to the authoring and creation of installers for use by test teams or by the ultimate consumer of the software. The services provided may include software build (compilation) automation, automated test integration, results reporting, and production of or preparation for software delivery systems‚Äîe.g., in the form of electronic media (CDs, DVDs) or electronic software distribution mechanisms.

He was a member of the Republican party, and served as House Minority Leader from 1911 to 1919.  Early life and education  James Robert Mann was born near Bloomington, McLean County, Illinois on October 20, 1856. His older brother was Frank Irving Mann (1854-1937) farmer, editor of the Prairie Farmer news publication, and author of The Farmers Creed. Mann attended University of Illinois and graduated in 1876. He graduated from Union College of Law in 1881 and became a lawyer in Chicago. Mann held several local political offices before serving in the House of Representatives.  Career  He was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1881 and commenced his practice in Chicago. He held several local offices before being elected as a congressman: * Member of the Oakland Board of Education in Chicago (1887) * Attorney for Hyde Park and the South Park commissioners of Chicago * Chairman of the Illinois State Republican convention (1894) * Member of the City Council of Chicago (1892-1896) * Master in chancery of the Superior Court of Cook County * Chairman of the Republican county conventions at Chicago (1895, 1902) * Elected as Republican (1896) to the 55th Congress with 13 successive terms = Service in the House = * Chairman, Committee on Elections No. 1 (58th - 60th Congresses) * Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (61st Congress) * Committee on Women Suffrage (66th Congress) * Minority Leader (62nd - 65th Congresses) = Notable legislation = Congressman Mann was one of the sponsors of the Mann-Elkins Act, which gave more power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates. He is probably best known for his authorship of the Mann Act of 1910, which was a reaction to the \\"white slavery\\" issue and prohibited transportation of women between states for purposes of prostitution. He introduced legislation that became the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. He was considered to be a leader in the cause of amending the United States Constitution to grant suffrage to women. However, he was quoted as saying, \\"'They should have been at home where they belonged,' referring to the women in the pageant.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0112.html#article He was a leading opponent of the Harrison Act and Prohibition, despite the popularity of such legislation amongst his fellow Midwestern progressives.  Death  Mann died in Washington, D.C. of pneumonia on November 30, 1922 at age 66 before the close of the 67th United States Congress. He was interred in Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.

Johnston surrendered to William T. Sherman. The first meeting (April 17, 1865) saw Sherman agreeing to certain political demands by the Confederates, which were promptly rejected by the Union cabinet in Washington. Another meeting had to be held (April 26) to agree on military terms only, in line with Robert E. Lee‚Äôs recent surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. This effectively ended the war. History Original road connecting Durham Station and Hillsborough, NC. The Confederate General Johnston and Union General Sherman met on this road and asked the Bennett family if they could use their house to hold a meeting to discuss terms of surrender. After Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, he turned north through the Carolinas for the Carolinas Campaign. Confederate President Jefferson Davis met his General Joseph E. Johnston in Greensboro, North Carolina, while Sherman had stopped in Raleigh. Robert E. Lee's beleaguered Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Though Davis wished strongly to continue the war, Johnston sent a courier to the Union troops encamped at Morrisville Station, with a message to General Sherman, offering a meeting between the lines to discuss a truce. Johnston's army was still an active fighting force with an available line of retreat along which, according to Davis, \\"ample supplies\\" had been placed.Davis, p. 692 Johnston, escorted by a detachment of about 60 troopers of the 5th South Carolina Cavalry Regiment, traveled east along the Hillsborough Road toward Durham Station in Durham, Durham County. Sherman was riding west to meet him, with an escort of 200 men from the 9th and 13th Pennsylvania, 8th Indiana and 2nd Kentucky Cavalry. The farm of James and Nancy Bennett at Bennett Place, sometimes known as Bennett Farm, was a convenient place for privacy. The first day's discussion (April 17) was intensified by the telegram Sherman handed to Johnston, informing of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. They met the following day, April 18, and signed terms of surrender. However, on April 24, Grant arrived and informed Sherman that the terms had been rejected by the presidential cabinet in Washington because they exceeded the terms that Grant had given Lee and included civil matters.Barrett, p. 267-8 The opposing generals met again on April 26, 1865, and with the assistance of Gen. John M. Schofield, agreed to new terms omitting the controversial sections.Barrett, p. 270-1 The agreement disbanded all active Confederate forces in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, totaling 89,270 soldiers, which was the largest group to surrender during the Civil War. Largest surrender of the American Civil War The Bennett Place marker The difficulty in reaching a surrender agreement lay in part in Johnston's desire, influenced by President Davis, for more than the purely military surrender that Major General Sherman offered. Sherman's original terms matched those offered by Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant to General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, but Johnston along with General John C. Breckinridge, also serving as Secretary of War for the Confederacy, insisted on resolutions of political issues, including the reestablishment of state governments, return of some weapons to state arsenals and civil rights after the war. Sherman, in accordance with Lincoln's stated overall wishes for a compassionate and forgiving end to the war, agreed on terms that included the political issues. Sherman was unaware that on March 3, Lincoln had given Grant orders to discuss only military matters with Lee. Lincoln was later assassinated.Barrett, p. 273 After reading the original Sherman-Johnston terms of surrender, United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, taking a position in accordance with Lincoln's instructions to Grant, persuaded a unanimous Federal cabinet to reject the terms. Sherman was instructed to call Johnston back to the table and request the military surrender of Johnston's army.Barrett, p. 268, 274 In response, Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to disband his infantry and escape with his mounted troops. However, Johnston disobeyed his orders and agreed to meet again with Major General Sherman at Bennett Farm. The second negotiation session took place on April 26, 1865. The opposing generals agreed to new military surrender terms that were substantially identical to the ones Grant had given to Lee, supplemented with corollary implementation terms written by Schofield pertaining to rations and return of the paroled soldiers to their homes.Barrett, p. 271 The surrender agreement ended the war for the 89,270 soldiers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Three more primary surrenders would follow in Citronelle, Alabama; Galveston, Texas; and Doaksville, Oklahoma. Bennett Place State Historic Site Unity Monument at Bennett Place Unity Monument Inscription James and Nancy Bennett, owners of the meeting place, were simple yeoman farmers who had suffered tremendously during the four years of war. They lost a son and son-in-law: Lorenzo, who served in the 27th North Carolina, buried in Winchester, Virginia; and their daughter Eliza's husband, Robert Duke, who died in a Confederate Army hospital and is buried in Lynchburg, Virginia. Their 3rd child, Alfonzo, was not in the war but died during the Civil War years (1864). The Bennetts never fully recovered from the war, and in 1878, James Bennett died and the family moved to the new community of Durham to begin a life without him. The farm was abandoned and fell into ruin; a fire finally destroying the farmhouse in 1921. In 1923 the Unity monument was dedicated on the site. Among the many contributors to the preservation of this historic landmark were the Duke, Everett, and Morgan families. In 1960 the site was fully reclaimed and restored by local preservationists. It was reconstructed as a two-story log structure covered by weatherboards with a gable roof and a shed addition. Also on the property are a log kitchen and smokehouse. It was then turned over to the State of North Carolina and made a state historic site. The Bennett Place State Historic Site now belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and is located in the west end of Durham, near Duke University. The site is open to the public, Tuesday-Saturday, 9am-5pm, with a visitor center, museum, theater presentation, \\"Dawn of Peace\\", research library, gift shop, and the reconstruction of the Bennett farm. Living history programs and the commemoration of the surrender take place throughout the year. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. On April 15, 2010, the Bennett Place Historic Site unveiled a new painting by Civil War artist Dan Nance, entitled \\"The First Meeting\\". On the same day, the site gave its first William Vatavuk Scholarship, a yearly scholarship for students who wish to major in history in college. The scholarship honors the late William Vatavuk, who wrote Dawn of Peace, the first guidebook for the historic site.

It starts by expressing the population moments (i.e., the expected values of powers of the random variable under consideration) as functions of the parameters of interest. Those expressions are then set equal to the sample moments. The number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated. Those equations are then solved for the parameters of interest. The solutions are estimates of those parameters. The method of moments was introduced by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1887 in the proof of the central limit theorem. The idea of matching empirical moments of a distribution to the population moments dates back at least to Pearson. Method Suppose that the problem is to estimate k unknown parameters \\\\theta_{1}, \\\\theta_2, \\\\dots, \\\\theta_k characterizing the distribution f_W(w; \\\\theta) of the random variable W.K. O. Bowman and L. R. Shenton, \\"Estimator: Method of Moments\\", pp 2092‚Äì2098, Encyclopedia of statistical sciences, Wiley (1998). Suppose the first k moments of the true distribution (the \\"population moments\\") can be expressed as functions of the \\\\thetas: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu_1 & \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname E[W]=g_1(\\\\theta_1, \\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_k) , \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\mu_2 & \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname E[W^2]=g_2(\\\\theta_1, \\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_k), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu_k & \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname E[W^k]=g_k(\\\\theta_1, \\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_k). \\\\end{align} Suppose a sample of size n is drawn, resulting in the values w_1, \\\\dots, w_n. For j=1,\\\\dots,k, let :\\\\widehat\\\\mu_j = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^j be the j-th sample moment, an estimate of \\\\mu_j. The method of moments estimator for \\\\theta_1, \\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_k denoted by \\\\widehat\\\\theta_1, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_2, \\\\dots, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_k is defined as the solution (if there is one) to the equations: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\widehat \\\\mu_1 & = g_1(\\\\widehat\\\\theta_1, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_k), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\widehat \\\\mu_2 & = g_2(\\\\widehat\\\\theta_1, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_k), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\widehat \\\\mu_k & = g_k(\\\\widehat\\\\theta_1, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\widehat\\\\theta_k). \\\\end{align} Advantages and disadvantages The method of moments is fairly simple and yields consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions), though these estimators are often biased. In some respects, when estimating parameters of a known family of probability distributions, this method was superseded by Fisher's method of maximum likelihood, because maximum likelihood estimators have higher probability of being close to the quantities to be estimated and are more often unbiased. However, in some cases the likelihood equations may be intractable without computers, whereas the method-of-moments estimators can be computed much more quickly and easily. Due to easy computability, method- of-moments estimates may be used as the first approximation to the solutions of the likelihood equations, and successive improved approximations may then be found by the Newton-Raphson method. In this way the method of moments can assist in finding maximum likelihood estimates. In some cases, infrequent with large samples but not so infrequent with small samples, the estimates given by the method of moments are outside of the parameter space (as shown in the example below); it does not make sense to rely on them then. That problem never arises in the method of maximum likelihood. Also, estimates by the method of moments are not necessarily sufficient statistics, i.e., they sometimes fail to take into account all relevant information in the sample. When estimating other structural parameters (e.g., parameters of a utility function, instead of parameters of a known probability distribution), appropriate probability distributions may not be known, and moment-based estimates may be preferred to maximum likelihood estimation. Examples An example application of the method of moments is to estimate polynomial probability density distributions. In this case, an approximate polynomial of order N is defined on an interval [a,b]. The method of moments then yields a system of equations, whose solution involves the inversion of a Hankel matrix.J. Munkhammar, L. Mattsson, J. Ryd√©n (2017) \\"Polynomial probability distribution estimation using the method of moments\\". PLoS ONE 12(4): e0174573. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174573 = Uniform distribution = Consider the uniform distribution on the interval [a,b], U(a,b). If W\\\\sim U(a,b) then we have : \\\\mu_1 = \\\\operatorname E[W]=\\\\frac{1}{2}(a+b) : \\\\mu_2 = \\\\operatorname E[W^2]=\\\\frac{1}{3}(a^2+ab+b^2) Solving these equations gives : \\\\widehat{a} = \\\\mu_1 - \\\\sqrt{3\\\\left(\\\\mu_2-\\\\mu_1^2\\\\right)} : \\\\widehat{b} = \\\\mu_1 + \\\\sqrt{3\\\\left(\\\\mu_2-\\\\mu_1^2\\\\right)} Given a set of samples \\\\\\\\{w_i\\\\\\\\} we can use the sample moments \\\\widehat{\\\\mu}_1 and \\\\widehat{\\\\mu}_2 in these formulae in order to estimate a and b. Note, however, that this method can produce inconsistent results in some cases.

It consists of a pattern of bright \\"spokes\\" on a dark background that radiate from a common center and become wider as they get further from it. In concept, the spokes only meet at the exact center of the star ‚Äì the spokes, and the gaps between them, become narrower the closer to the center one looks, but they never touch except at the center. When printed or displayed on a device with limited resolution, however, the spokes touch at some distance from the center. The smallest gap visible is limited by the smallest dot of ink the printer can produce, making the Siemens star a useful tool for comparing two printers' resolutions (DPI). Similarly, it can be applied to a camera's optical resolution by taking photographs of a Siemens star printed at high resolution and comparing photographs from different cameras, to see which retained the center detail the closest. A Siemens chart filter in a collimator, used for auto-focus calibration of digital still cameras In the field of video production, where it is often called a back focus chart, the Siemens star is widely used to adjust the back focus of removable lenses. It is also used during film or video shoots to help setting the focus in special situations. Siemens stars are similar to the sunburst pattern used as a background in graphic design, as in the Japanese Naval Ensign, Russian Air Force flag and Jordanian Royal Standard. They are useful in drawing the eye to a point on the page. A Siemens star with 128 spokes. It shows aliasing in the center, where the spokes are smaller than the pixel pitch. (It is not blurred or aberrated, so it does not show spurious resolution.) Under optical blur from defocus, a Siemens star (like any periodic pattern) gives rise to the phenomenon of spurious resolution above the resolution limit, i.e. toward the center of the Siemens star. (Spurious resolution appears similar to aliasing, but it is a purely optical phenomenon, so it occurs without need of pixels.) This results in inverted polarity of the stripe pattern: black stripes appear in the place of white stripes and vice versa (and further polarity inversions occur further inward). (The illustration under Optical transfer function shows spurious resolution caused by blurring.) When looking at the Siemens star with slightly blurred vision, e.g., without spectacles or with defocus from staring, this is seen as a shimmering ring around the Siemens star's center that changes size with viewing distance. The star was developed by Siemens & Halske AG (today Siemens) in the 1930s to test the lenses of Siemens narrow-film cameras.Alexandra Kinter, Siemens AG, Siemens Archives in Munich, Germany.

It is a hemicellulose component in the cell walls of some plant species. Glucomannan is a food additive used as an emulsifier and thickener. Products containing glucomannan, under a variety of brand names, are marketed as dietary supplements with claims they can relieve constipation and help lower cholesterol levels. Since 2010 they are legally marketed in Europe as helping with weight loss for people who are overweight and eating a diet with restricted calories, but as of 2014 the evidence did not support this effect. Supplements containing glucomannans pose a risk for choking and bowel obstruction if they are not taken with sufficient water. Other adverse effects include diarrhea, belching, and bloating; in one study people taking glucomannans had higher triglyceride levels. Glucomannans are also used to supplement animal feed for farmed animals, to help the animals gain weight more quickly. Chemistry Glucomannan is mainly a straight-chain polymer, with a small amount of branching. The component sugars are Œ≤-(1‚Üí4)-linked D-mannose and D-glucose in a ratio of 1.6:1. The degree of branching is about 8% through Œ≤-(1‚Üí6)-glucosyl linkages. Glucomannan with Œ±-(1‚Üí6)-linked galactose units in side branches is called galactoglucomannan. Biological function In the yeast cell wall, mannan oligosaccharides are present in complex molecules that are linked to the protein moiety. There are two main locations of mannan oligosaccharides in the surface area of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. They can be attached to the cell wall proteins as part of ‚ÄìO and ‚ÄìN glycosyl groups and also constitute elements of large Œ±-D- mannanose polysaccharides (Œ±-D-Mannans), which are built of Œ±-(1,2)- and Œ±-(1,3)- D-mannose branches (from 1 to 5 rings long), which are attached to long Œ±-(1,6)-D-mannose chains. This specific combination of various functionalities involves mannan oligosaccharides-protein conjugates and highly hydrophilic and structurally variable 'brush-like' mannan oligosaccharides structures that can fit to various receptors of animal digestive tracts, and to the receptors on the surface of bacterial membranes, impacts these molecules bioactivity. Mannan oligosaccharides-protein conjugates are involved in interactions with the animal's immune system and as result enhance immune system activity. They also play a role in animal antioxidant and antimutagenic defense. Natural sources Glucomannan comprises 40% by dry weight of the roots, or corm, of the konjac plant. Another culinary source is salep, ground from the roots of certain orchids and used in Greek and Turkish cuisine. However, these orchid species are protected in the whole EU and the trade of salep is strictly forbidden. Glucomannan is also a hemicellulose that is present in large amounts in the wood of conifers and in smaller amounts in the wood of dicotyledons. Glucomannan is also a constituent of bacterial, plant and yeast cell wall with differences in the branches or glycosidic linkages in the linear structure.Elbein, A. D. (1969).

Retrieved 27 September, 2018. =Human dietary supplement= Glucomannan is an ingredient in a variety of dietary supplement products marketed with claims that they aid in weight loss, but medical research has found no good evidence to support its use for this purpose. The claim is that it makes a gel when mixed with water, which can take up space in the stomach and linger there longer than water alone would, inducing a person to feel full after having eaten a smaller amount of food. In Europe and Canada, glucomannan dietary supplements can be marketed with claims to lower cholesterol levels and to relieve constipation. Health risks A health advisory was released by Health Canada stating the following: \\"Natural health products containing the ingredient glucomannan in tablet, capsule or powder form, which are currently on the Canadian market, have a potential for harm if taken without at least 250 ml or 8 ounces of water or other fluid. The risk includes choking and/or blockage of the throat, esophagus or intestine, according to international adverse reaction case reports. It is also important to note that these products should not be taken immediately before going to bed.\\" Other adverse effects include diarrhea, belching, and bloating; in one study people taking glucomannans had higher triglyceride levels.

He had a long career in BBC drama, which included producing series such as Doctor Who and Talking Heads. Early life and career Following service in the Royal Navy, Innes Lloyd trained as an actor at the Central School of Speech and Drama. He joined the BBC in the 1950s, initially in presentation before moving into outside broadcasts. As an outside broadcast producer he covered many important sporting events such as tennis at Wimbledon, golf and motor racing. He also produced important national events such as the Royal Christmas Message and Winston Churchill's state funeral.https://pocketmags.com/de/doctor-who- magazine/536/articles/538063/daleks-vs-grass Doctor Who Lloyd began his drama career when he was made the producer of the science fiction series Doctor Who in 1966. He was the third producer on the programme and his duration as producer ran for two seasons between The Celestial Toymaker and The Enemy of the World (with the exception of The Tomb of the Cybermen, which was produced by Peter Bryant as a test piece to show that he could take over from Lloyd). During his tenure as producer the concept of regeneration was introduced, whereby the lead actor in the programme might be replaced. This arose following continuing health difficulties with William Hartnell as the lead actor. Lloyd and story editor Gerry Davis came up with an intriguing way of writing the Doctor out - as he was an alien being, they decided that he would have the power to change his body when it became worn out or seriously injured. Whereas John Wiles, the previous producer to Lloyd, had intended to replace Hartnell with another actor but playing the same character, Lloyd and Davis elected to change the entire personality and appearance of the Doctor. They eventually cast character actor Patrick Troughton, having previously considered another actor, Peter Jeffrey, as well as Peter Cushing, who had played Dr. Who in two Dr. Who movies. Troughton first appeared in November 1966 after the changeover from Hartnell had been seen at the end of the story The Tenth Planet. Lloyd's era as producer of Doctor Who became known as a monster era. It saw the introduction of recurring monsters such as the Cybermen, the Ice Warriors and the Yeti. He also terminated the purely historical stories prominent in the first three seasons of classic Doctor Who. Other work Innes Lloyd also worked on Thirty-Minute Theatre, the football soap United! and Dead of Night, but he is best remembered as the producer of more prestigious drama. As a BBC drama producer in the 1970s and 1980s, his chosen projects were often biographical. Collaborating with authors such as Roger Milner and Don Shaw, he brought to the screen biographies from a diverse range of, often flawed, heroes ranging from Orde Wingate and Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris, the Campbells Donald and Malcolm, through to the first Director General of the BBC John Reith. He also explored notions of Englishness in the twentieth century with productions such as England, Their England (directed by Stephen Frears), East of Ipswich (written by Michael Palin) and An Englishman's Castle (1978) starring Kenneth More; a dystopian vision of the consequence of losing the second world war. He was a frequent collaborator with Alan Bennett. That relationship started in 1972 with Bennett's poignant comedy A Day Out and continued through landmark productions such as the first series of Talking Heads until Lloyd's death in 1991. Bennett's An Englishman Abroad told the remarkable true story of the chance meeting between actress Coral Browne (playing herself) and spy Guy Burgess (Alan Bates) in Moscow in 1958, while A Question of Attribution (finished shortly before Lloyd's death) was a logical sequel, showing the radically different fate of Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures and fellow traitor Anthony Blunt. Personal life and death Innes was one of his two middle names as well as his mother's maiden name. Lloyd died of cancer on 23 August 1991, aged 65.

Hopkins was involved in the success of the first live poker tournament on television, The Poker Million, in 2000. The Channel recruited Chris White, ex Fremantle executive, as Commercial Director in 2006 to expand the company into European, Asian and Latin American markets. The channel was first broadcast in the UK in March 2005 on channel number 265. Following an EPG re-structure by Sky in April 2006 the channel was moved to channel number 844 in Sky's new 'Gaming and Dating' section. The move resulted in a loss in viewing figures. In an attempt to regain viewing figures The Poker Channel rebranded itself as All in Sport in August 2006 and added some sports related programming. The rebranding resulted in a move to channel 444 in the Sports section of the Sky EPG. Due to Sky's broadcasting rules the channel was only able to broadcast poker programming for 4 to 6 hours a day. On 31 December 2006 the channel decided to cease broadcasting as a 24-hour channel on Sky in the UK, due to Sky's EPG re-structure and limitations on poker programming broadcast hours, and started a long-term partnership with Sky Channel 166 (Info TV Ltd) to broadcast poker programming in a late evening slot, where the Poker Channel broadcast between 9.30pm and 4am. On 1 March 2007, to capitalise on the popularity of poker in Europe, The Poker Channel launched as a free-to-air channel on cable platforms in France (Free and Numericable) and Germany (Kabel BW), and in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark on DTH satellite platform, Canal Digital. In late 2007, The Poker Channel increased distribution in Germany (Kabel Deutschland and Unity Media) and launched with cable platforms in Belgium (BeTV and Coditel), Luxembourg (Coditel), Iceland (Skjarinn), Malta (Melita Cable) and Spain (Movistar TV). In 2008, the Channel expanded its footprint further in Finland (Welho, Maxinetti) and launched in the Netherlands, on KPN and in the digital basic package of UPC, adjacent to Eurosport in UPC's EPG, as well as in Greece (OnTelecom) and on the online TV service, Zattoo, in various European countries including Switzerland. In 2007, the channel also extended its presence online, setting up content and marketing partnerships with online video sites including YouTube, Dailymotion, Zattoo and Blinkx. In September 2008 The Poker Channel re-launched their web site, PokerChannelEurope.com, in partnership with online video platform Brightcove. The partnership facilitates the delivery of free advertising-supported video content on poker. The Poker Channel recruited Paul Sandells in July 2008, former UK.PokerNews.com editor, as Editor in Chief of the site. In 2009 and 2010 the Poker Channel continued to expand its availability in Europe, including launches on all cable platforms in Portugal (Zon, Meo, Cabovisao); Neufbox (SFR) in France; Austria Telekom, Vectra and UPC in Poland, and making the channel available to all subscribers of Focussat, DigiTV and UPC Direct in Eastern Europe in Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia. In 2010 Poker Channel partnered with media companies in Latin America to launch in Spanish language in Argentina and Mexico. On 3 December 2012, the Poker Channel was rebranded as the Player Channel.Poker Channel is Rebranded to the Player Channel as it increased the level of sports-betting programming on the channel, including a weekly sports-betting tipping show, Best of Bets. In October 2013, the Player Channel was acquired by leading e-sports channel Ginx TV. The acquisition gave Ginx distribution in an additional 19 million households, including 13 million in France. Programming The Poker Channel broadcast a range of poker- related programmes acquired from around the world, such as the World Series of Poker, the World Series of Poker Europe, the Aussie Millions, the Irish Open, the Grosvenor UK Poker Tour, the Great British Poker Tour, Poker Island TV, the World Series of Backgammon, the Million Dollar Cash Game, the Poker Nations Cup, the World Poker Crown, The World Heads-up Championship and the World Poker Tour. The Poker Channel has also commissioned or produced poker programmes such as the PokerHeaven.com European Cash Game which featured WSOP 2008 winner Peter Eastgate, the British Poker Open, Cash Game Master Class, live broadcasts of online tournaments, 12 Steps to Poker Heaven, and the European Poker Masters. With the rebrand, casino and trading shows were also added.The Player Channel All this programming was dropped in favour of video game programming when the channel was acquired by Ginx TV. The channel also had a three-hour overnight slot on CNBC Europe, which broadcast six nights a week for several years across Europe, and held partnerships with other international sports and entertainment broadcasters such as TVC Deportes in Mexico.

Geography Sonning Eye is about northeast of Reading, Berkshire. Sonning Eye is opposite the village of Sonning, Berkshire, to which it is linked by crossing the 18th-century brick-arched Sonning Bridge combined with Sonning Backwater Bridges. Sonning Eye is surrounded by the alluvial floodplain of the River Thames, much of which has been extracted for gravel, forming a number of lakes, especially upstream on this bank. In particular, a long rowing lake has been made, the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake, named after Olympic oarsmen Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Other local sports include sailing and water skiing. Berry Brook, a small tributary runs through the floodplain west and north of Sonning Eye, joining the Thames at Hallsmead Ait to the northeast. Backwater of the Thames at Sonning Eye, with a view of the French Horn at Sonning. On the riverside near the Sonning Backwater Bridges is the French Horn, a luxury hotel and restaurant. There is a small public car park here, a place to launch small boats, and a grass area by the river bank that is popular with fishermen. History Its toponym \\"Sonning\\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon chieftain Sunna and \\"Eye\\" meaning island (cf. eyot) since it is a small gravel mound surrounded by the river's flood plain. Within this low land is a true island (permanent since management of the river levels) on the Thames. Until 1866, Sonning Eye formed part of the Oxfordshire section of Sonning civil parish. The heart of Sonning Eye is a conservation area, including 12 architecturally Grade II listed buildings, five of which are barns that have now been converted for modern use. One house has some excellent William De Morgan tiles. Buildings of the island The island is roughly heart-shaped, cut through by a millrace. On the islet is The Mill at Sonning, a restored 18th century watermill on a medieval site, now converted to a dinner theatre.The Mill at Sonning . The millrace runs through what is now the theatre bar, and powers a small turbine powering an 18.5 kW hydroelectric generator that supplies the National Grid.The Mill at Sonning: Hydro Scheme . Set behind this on the island is Mill House, a Grade II listed building owning some of the island. It was originally built in the 17th Century and once owned by the wealthy Rich family, Lords of the Manor of Sonning, hence owning its manor house towards the top of Sonning's Thames Street as well. Sir Thomas Rich founded Reading Blue Coat School just south of here in 1766 by endowing it with the income with his neighbouring farmland. In 2014, the Mill House was bought by the American film star George Clooney and his new British wife, human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, at a cost of around ¬£10 million. Paintings and sketches The area has been a favourite location for artists, especially views of the old, disused brick bridge and viaduct from the river bank just downstream of the island with surrounding lush flora. George Price Boyce, the Victorian watercolour painter associated with the Pre- Raphaelite art movement, visited and painted in the area.

It is commonly used on state government buildings, vehicles and other effects of the state government. It also appears on the state flag of Florida. The University of Florida was bestowed the honor of using the seal as its university seal. The seal features a shoreline on which a Seminole woman is spreading flowers. Legend says that the woman is the historical heroine Milly Francis, but there is no documentation supporting this. Two Sabal palms (Florida's state tree) are growing. In the background a steamboat sails before a sun breaking the horizon, with rays of sunlight extending into the sky. The seal is encircled with the words \\"Great Seal of the State of Florida\\", and \\"In God We Trust\\" (the state motto). History The Florida Legislature in 1868 specified in a Joint Resolution the design of Florida's first seal. \\"The Resolution specified that the seal had to be the size of an American silver dollar. It also stated that the seal should contain the sun's rays, a cocoa tree, a steamboat, and a female Indian scattering flowers. These images were to be circled by the words 'Great Seal of the State of Florida: In God We Trust.'\\" Several changes have occurred on the seal over the years. The Indian woman no longer has a feathered headdress, which female Seminoles did not wear. \\"A mountain in the background has been flattened (Florida has no mountains). The steamboat has been repaired a few times. And a sabal palm has been transplanted in place of the original cocoa tree to reflect the state's adoption of the sabal palmetto palm as the official state tree in 1953. The latest revisions took place in 1985.\\" Use of the seal The Florida Secretary of State is the official custodian of the seal. Use or display of the seal must be for an official purpose and approved by the Florida Department of State. One exception is that other Florida state or local agencies can use or display the seal for official business if approved by head of their agency.Rule 1-2.0021, Florida Administrative Code Illegal use of the seal in Florida is a second-degree misdemeanor.

S. Lewis's fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia. She appears in two of the seven books: The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. Biography =In The Magician's Nephew= Polly is introduced in The Magician's Nephew - which was the sixth book in the series to be published but is first in the internal chronology of Narnia. In 1900, she is an 11-year-old girl who lives in London, England in a multi-story terrace house and is the neighbor of Digory Kirke's aunt, with whom is staying Digory and his gravely ill mother. Polly befriends Digory and one of the places they play in together, is her house's attic room, which leads into an inner-roof space which also connects to the attic rooms in all the houses in their row of terrace houses. Polly uses the attic as a hide- out where she drinks ginger beer and is gradually writing a private story which does not share with Digory. One day whilst exploring the inner roof space in the row of terrace houses, the children accidentally enter the study of Digory's Uncle Andrew. He is an alarming person initially in his own domain but he successfully ingratiates himself with Polly and offers her a yellow ring as a gift which causes her to vanish as soon as she touches it. Uncle Andrew believes Polly has now been sent to another world and blackmails Digory into following her with another ring, in order to bring her back so he can hear about what is occurring in the 'other place'. Digory is forced to comply and this results in him finding himself (with Polly) in another place. However, this is not a place as Uncle Andrew had imagined and between Digory's sharp mind and inquisitiveness and Polly's practical caution and concern for safety, they realize that if they are careful they can use this Wood between the Worlds in the same way as the inner roof space as the terrace houses; linking to all the worlds. The Wood is scattered with large pools as far as they can see and they have emerged from just one. Polly and Digory come to realize that Digory's Uncle Andrew has no inkling of this reality as he is just an ignorant dabbler in arcane arts, with only pretensions to be a magician and is also not prepared to take his own risks. After working this out, Polly and Digory decided to try a nearby pool and travel to the ruined city of Charn on a dead world that has a dying sun. There, against Polly's advice, Digory breaks an enchantment which releases Jadis, the future White Witch. Jadis follows the children back through the Wood to London. After returning home and being confined to her room for missing dinner and having wet shoes and stockings from jumping in puddles, Polly helps Digory return Jadis to the Wood and then attempt to return her to Charn. Instead the pool they choose takes them to the new world of Narnia, where they witness its first dawning and the creation of life by Aslan. Polly, Digory, and a cabby and his horse (who were brought along by mistake) are the only ones not alarmed by Aslan or his singing (Jadis and Uncle Andrew are both terrified); Jadis because she knows what he is and Andrew because he has no idea. After the world is created, the children and the flying talking horse Fledge (Strawberry, the Cabby's roan horse who has been transformed) fly to a walled garden in the Western Wild to retrieve a magical apple. This apple, when planted, grows into a tree that serves to protect the young land of Narnia. Aslan gave Digory an apple from the newly planted tree to heal his sick mother. Polly and Digory then return to England, where he heals his mother and buries the apple core and the rings around it. Digory later moves away to a great house that his parents inherited from a great uncle. Polly spends nearly every holiday at their house in the country, and she and Digory remain close friends all their lives. Polly's role and personality throughout the story appears to counterbalance Digory's drive, aggression and grief with her stolidity, friendship, morality and sense of care, caution and safety. Polly's role is as an emotional and moral support (and challenge) to Digory who is written as the protagonist. However, her own sense of adventure, discovery and wonder are no less than Digory's and her experience of Narnia and the spiritual enlightenment and security that their encounter with Aslan provides, give both her and Digory the basis for a very important platonic friendship throughout their lives. =In The Last Battle= In The Last Battle, the final book in the series (both chronologically and in order of publication), Polly is an adult of 60. She remains in contact with the other British \\"friends of Narnia\\" and is present with them when the apparition of Narnia's King Tirian appears to request their help. She seems like a very cheery, friendly, and wise adult; the children refer to her as \\"Aunt Polly\\". She is later killed in a railway accident and is transported to Aslan's country along with the other friends of Narnia. Once she arrives in Narnia, she and Digory become young again, and they are both dressed as royalty (and referred to as Lady Polly and Lord Digory).

It is owned by the city of Carlsbad and located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) southwest of its central business district. The airport is served by one commercial airline, with scheduled passenger service subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 2,207 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 3,417 enplanements in 2009, and 2,606 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility (the commercial service category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year).  Facilities and aircraft  Cavern City Air Terminal covers an area of 1,980 acres (801 ha) at an elevation of 3,295 feet (1,004 m) above mean sea level. It has four runways with asphalt surfaces: 3/21 is 7,854 by 150 feet (2,394 x 46 m); 14L/32R is 4,616 by 150 feet (1,407 x 46 m); 14R/32L is 5,837 by 100 feet (1,779 x 30 m); 8/26 is 5,334 by 75 feet (1,626 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending July 30, 2009, the airport had 6,862 aircraft operations, an average of 18 per day: 53% general aviation, 39% scheduled commercial, 4% air taxi, and 4% military. At that time there were 24 aircraft based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 21% multi-engine, and 12% helicopter.  Airline and destinations  The following airline offers scheduled passenger service: A Boutique Air PC-12. Boutique Air operates Pilatus PC-12 turboprop aircraft on all flights. The aircraft is equipped with an eight-seat executive interior. A two-person flight crew is utilized by Boutique.  Historical Airline Service  Continental Airlines was the first commercial air carrier to serve Carlsbad. Continental began service on May 14, 1940 with flights to El Paso and Denver, the latter included stops in Albuquerque and several other cities. Aircraft used were Lockheed Model 10 Electra's and Lockheed Lodestar's followed by the Douglas DC-3. With the end of World War II, flights to Denver were discontinued and new flights were added going east to San Antonio and Kansas City, each making several stops. Flights to El Paso and Albuquerque remained. A small commuter carrier named Bison Airlines served the city for a couple years in the early 1960s as well. In 1963 Continental transferred its route authority for Carlsbad to Trans-Texas Airways which modified the eastbound flights to go directly to Dallas. Trans-Texas later changed their name to Texas International Airlines (TI) and replaced the DC-3s with 40-seat Convair 600 turboprop aircraft. For a short time in the late 1970s, TI upgraded all flights with 85-seat Douglas DC-9-10 jets but reverted to the Convair 600's after about a year. In 1979 TI ended their service transferring their route authority over to commuter carriers Air Midwest and Crown Airlines. Crown operated flights to Albuquerque with Cessna 402 and Piper Navajo aircraft but went out of business in 1980. Air Midwest used 17-seat Swearingen Metroliners on flights to Albuquerque and Midland/Odessa. In 1984 Mesa Airlines began service on the same routes using Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900 airliners. Air Midwest then left the city two years later. For a very short time in the spring of 1987, Continental Express operated by Trans Colorado Airlines served the city with flights to Albuquerque and El Paso also using Metroliners. Mesa continued their service until 2007 when they, like their predecessors, grew too large and discontinued serving small cities with small aircraft. Pacific Wings, dba New Mexico Airlines, then stepped in with flights to Albuquerque, El Paso, and Midland/Odessa but used much smaller and unpressurized Cessna 208 Caravans. Flights to El Paso and Midland were later dropped and the carrier ended all service in 2015 when Boutique Air took over. Boutique began with one daily flight to Albuquerque and one to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) using 8-seat Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. A second daily flight to Albuquerque was added in 2017. The airport also saw service by Big Sky Airlines for a brief time in 2000/2001 which operated flights to DFW using Swearingen Metroliners.Timetables from all the airlines that have served Carlsbad, NM Carlsbad Army Airfield AAF Bombardier School patch, 1943 Carlsbad Army Air Field 1944 Classbook Established by the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 as Carlsbad Army Airfield, the facility was activated on October 12, 1942. Assigned to United States Army Air Forces West Coast Training Center (later Western Training Command) as an advanced (level 3) twin-engine training airfield. Began training flying cadets under the 940th Two-Engine Flying Training Detachment. Had a local axillary airfield for emergency and overflow landings. The twin-engine school was replaced by Bombardier's School in mid-1942. Bombardier school lasted from 12 to 18 weeks during which a student dropped approximately 160 bombs, both in daytime and at night. Precise records were maintained of his hits and misses; the elimination rate was 12%. Upon graduation, a bombardier was transferred to an operational Second or Third Air Force training unit to join a crew being trained for overseas duty. The bombardier trainer used was the Beech AT-11 Kansan. Inactivated on September 30, 1945 at the end of World War II and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers. Eventually discharged to the War Assets Administration (WAA) and became a civil airport.

Laetiporus sulphureus is a saprophyte and occasionally a weak parasite, causing brown cubical rot in the heartwood of trees on which it grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young, although adverse reactions have been reported. Taxonomy and phylogenetics Laetiporus sulphureus was first described as Boletus sulphureus by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1789. It has had many synonyms and was finally given its current name in 1920 by American mycologist William Murrill. Laetiporus means \\"with bright pores\\" and sulphureus means the colour of sulphur. Investigations in North America have shown that there are several similar species within what has been considered L. sulphureus, and that the true L. sulphureus may be restricted to regions east of the Rocky Mountains. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS, nuclear large subunit and mitochondrial small subunit rDNA sequences from North American collections have delineated five distinct clades within the core Laetiporus clade:Burdsall, Jr., Harold H.; Banik, Mark T. (2001). \\"The genus Laetiporus in North America\\". Harvard Papers in Botany 6 (1): 43‚Äì55. *Conifericola clade: contains species that live on conifers, such as L. conifericola and L. huroniensis. All of the other tested species grow on angiosperms. *Cincinnatus clade: contains L. cincinnatus *Sulphureus clade I: contains white-pored L. sulfureus isolates. *Sulphureus clade II: contains yellow-pored L. sulfureus isolates. *Gilbertsonii clade: contains L. gilbertsonii and unidentified Caribbean isolates. Description Underside, on Ginkgo biloba The fruiting body emerges directly from the trunk of a tree and is initially knob-shaped, but soon expands to fan-shaped shelves, typically growing in overlapping tiers. It is sulphur-yellow to bright orange in color and has a suedelike texture. Old fruitbodies fade to tan or whitish. Each shelf may be anywhere from across and up to thick. The fertile surface is sulphur-yellow with small pores or tubes and produces a white spore print. When fresh, the flesh is succulent with a strong fungal aroma and exudes a yellowish, transparent juice, but soon becomes dry and brittle. Distribution and habitat Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus) on the Trinity Trail, Palos Heights, Illinois on September 10, 2019. Laetiporus sulphureus is widely distributed across Europe and North America, although its range may be restricted to areas east of the Rockies. It grows on dead or mature hardwoods and has been reported from a very wide variety of host trees, such as Quercus, Prunus, Pyrus, Populus, Salix, Robinia, and Fagus, occasionally also from conifers,Breitenbach J., Kr√§nzlin F. (1986). Fungi of Switzerland, Volume 2: Non-gilled fungi. Verlag Mykologia, Luzern, Switzerland . from August to October or later, sometimes as early as June. In the Mediterranean region, this species is usually found on Ceratonia and Eucalyptus.Kyriakou T., Loizides M., Tziakouris A. (2009). Rarities & Oddities from Cyprus. Field Mycology 10 (3): 94‚Äì98.DOI: 10.1016/S1468-1641(10)60600-7 It can usually be found growing in clusters. =Parasitism= The fungus causes brown cubical rot of heartwood in the roots, tree base and stem. After infection, the wood is at first discolored yellowish to red but subsequently becomes reddish-brown and brittle. At the final stages of decay, the wood can be rubbed like powder between the fingers. =Guinness world record= A specimen weighing was found in the New Forest, Hampshire, United Kingdom, on 15 October 1990. Palatability Laetiporus sulphureus prepared dish, with onions Due to its taste, Laetiporus sulphureus has been called the chicken polypore and chicken- of-the-woods (not to be confused with Grifola frondosa, the so-called hen-of- the-woods). Many people think that the mushroom tastes like crab or lobster leading to the nickname lobster-of-the-woods. The authors of Mushrooms in Color said that the mushroom tastes good sauteed in butter or prepared in a cream sauce served on toast or rice. It is highly regarded in Germany and North America. Young specimens are edible if they exude large amounts of a clear to pale yellow watery liquid. The mushroom should not be eaten raw. Certain species of deer consume this type of mushroom. =Allergic effects= Some people have experienced gastrointestinal upset after eating this mushroom, and it should not be consumed raw. Severe adverse reactions can occur, including vomiting and fever, in about 10% of the population, but this is now thought to be the result of confusion with morphologically similar species such as Laetiporus huroniensis, which grows on hemlock trees, and L. gilbertsonii, which grows on Eucalyptus. Medicinal The fungus produces the Laetiporus sulphureus lectin (LSL) which exhibits haemolytic and haemagglutination activities. Haemolytic lectins are sugar-binding proteins that lyse and agglutinate cells. These biochemical activities are promoted when bound to carbohydrates. Cultivation Compared with species such as Agaricus bisporus (Swiss Brown mushroom) and the oyster mushroom, commercial cultivation of Laetiporus occurs at a much smaller and less mechanized scale.

Known as Admiral Taussig Boulevard, after U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Edward D. Taussig, the Interstate runs from Virginia State Route 337 (SR 337) east to I-64 within the city of Norfolk. I-564 is the primary access highway to Naval Station Norfolk, the world's largest naval base. The Interstate also links I-64 with Norfolk International Terminal via SR 406 and the Wards Corner area of Norfolk through connections with U.S. Route 460 (US 460) and SR 165. Route description View east at the west end of I-564 at SR 337 in Norfolk I-564 begins within the reservation of Naval Station Norfolk where Admiral Taussig Boulevard becomes a four-lane freeway; this point is also the eastern terminus of SR 337. The boulevard continues west as a four-lane divided highway to its intersection with Hampton Boulevard at naval station gates 1 and 2, where SR 337 turns south onto Hampton Boulevard toward downtown Norfolk. I-564 curves southeast through a trumpet interchange with the access road to gates 3 and 3A. The ramps to and from the interchange join the Interstate to form a six-lane freeway. I-564 descends into a tunnel to pass under the east-west runway of Chambers Field, a naval air station that has been consolidated with the larger naval base. East of the tunnel, I-564 heads southeast parallel to a rail line between the naval air station to the north and Camp Allen, a United States Marine Corps base, to the south. The Interstate has a partial interchange with SR 406 (International Terminal Boulevard) that allows access to the highway to Norfolk International Terminal to and from the east. Within the interchange, eastbound I-564 has an exit for westbound I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway) and US 460 (Granby Street). As I-564 crosses over US 460, the eastbound freeway has a left exit to and the westbound Interstate has a left entrance from I-64's reversible HOV lanes. Eastbound I-564 has an exit for SR 165 (Little Creek Road), which leads to SR 170, before the four-lane freeway merges into I-64 in the direction of Virginia Beach. History Interstate 564 replaced former SR 170, which linked Norfolk to northeastern North Carolina via North Carolina Highway 170. West of I-564, original SR 170 crossed a ferry to Hampton Roads, where it headed west along current I-64 to SR 30 northwest of Williamsburg. Future Long range plans may extend I-564 westward to Hampton/Newport News via a new bridge-tunnel. Traffic demands are increasing on Interstates 64 and 664. These are the only two connections between the eastern Tidewater cities with those to the northwest. The metropolitan area sees over 1.5 million people. Therefore extending I-564 would provide needed relief if the present bridges if they are not expanded from their current capacity. Exit list All exits are unnumbered.

He was the second producer of the science fiction series Doctor Who, succeeding Verity Lambert. Wiles was credited as producer on four serials between 1965 and 1966, namely The Myth Makers, The Daleks' Master Plan (which lasted for twelve episodes), The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, and The Ark. As Producer of Doctor Who (1965-66) Although he had a good working relationship with story editor Donald Tosh, Wiles found that he was unable to make many changes to the format of the programme. Attempts to make the series darker led to clashes with actor William Hartnell, who as the sole remaining member of the original team saw himself as the guardian of the series' original values. An attempt to give new companion Dodo Chaplet a cockney accent was vetoed by Wiles' superiors, who ordered that the regulars must speak \\"BBC English\\". With Hartnell increasingly in poor health and hostile to Wiles, the latter sought a way to replace the actor. However, this was again opposed by Wiles' superiors. Wiles also disliked the lengthy The Daleks' Master Plan story which had been commissioned by the previous production team and which proved difficult to realise. One of his few changes that lasted even a short time was to limit nearly all stories to just four episodes. In early 1966, Wiles resigned in frustration over an inability to steer the show in the direction he wished. Tosh resigned in sympathy. Of the episodes from his tenure, only the four episode serial The Ark, and three episodes from The Daleks' Master Plan, still survive in the BBC's archives. As Wiles chose not to employ John Cura and his Tele-snaps service, only a few publicity and behind the scenes photos give a visual record of his work on the series. After Doctor Who After leaving Doctor Who, Wiles wrote two stories for the science-fiction anthology series Out of the Unknown. These were Taste of Evil and The Man in My Head, both broadcast as part of its fourth and final season in 1971. Wiles also wrote several plays including Act of Hardness, Family on Trial and Blood and Roses. Wiles died on April 5, 1999 at the age of 73.

Aubrey Smith, whose acting career had spanned four decades, died in 1948; Little Women was his final film.Notes on Little Women at Turner Classic Movies Plot In the small town of Concord, Massachusetts, during the Civil War, the March sisters‚ÄîMeg (Janet Leigh), Jo (June Allyson), Amy (Elizabeth Taylor), and Beth (Margaret O'Brien)‚Äîlive with their mother in a state of genteel poverty, their father having lost the family's fortune to an unscrupulous businessman several years earlier. While Mr. March (Leon Ames) serves in the Union Army, Mrs. March (Mary Astor), affectionately referred to as \\"Marmee\\" by her daughters, holds the family together and teaches the girls the importance of giving to those less fortunate than themselves, especially during the upcoming Christmas season. Although the spoiled and vain Amy often bemoans the family's lack of material wealth and social status, Jo, an aspiring writer, keeps everyone entertained with her stories and plays, while the youngest March daughter, the shy and sensitive Beth, accompanies Jo's productions on an out-of-tune piano. The spirited Jo, a tomboy in search of male companionship, strikes up a friendship with Theodore \\"Laurie\\" Laurence (Peter Lawford), the grandson of the March's wealthy, but cantankerous neighbor, James Laurence (C. Aubrey Smith). Later that winter, Jo so impresses Mr. Laurence with her forthrightness and her beneficial effect on the brooding Laurie, that he invites the March sisters to a fancy dress ball at his sumptuous home. At the ball, Meg is courted by John Brooke (Richard Stapley), Laurie's tutor, and Jo consents to dance with Laurie while Amy and Beth breathlessly view the scene from their perch atop the staircase. Mr. Laurence's gruff demeanor is softened upon meeting Beth, who reminds him of the beloved granddaughter he lost, and when he learns of her musical talent, he offers her the use of his grand piano. The beautiful evening ends on a sour note, however, when Amy and Beth overhear the snobbish Mrs. Gardiner (Isabel Randolph) and her daughter gossiping about Marmee. As the weeks pass, Laurie's affection for Jo grows, but Jo rebuffs him as a suitor, claiming that although she loves him as a friend, she will never marry. Meanwhile, Jo attempts to discourage Meg's deepening feelings for Mr. Brooke, fearing that a marriage will break the bond between the sisters. Spring arrives, and Marmee receives word that Mr. March has been wounded and sent to an Army hospital in Washington, D.C. Jo asks her wealthy Aunt March (Lucile Watson) for Marmee's train fare, but the two have a heated argument when the impatient Jo refuses to address Aunt March with the decorum the proud woman demands. As usual, Aunt March comes through for the family, but not before Jo has had her beautiful chestnut locks cut off and sold in order to pay for Marmee's trip. While carrying out Marmee's work for the poor in her absence, Beth contracts scarlet fever, and the distressed and frightened sisters realize how much they depend upon Marmee. Just as Marmee returns, however, Beth's fever breaks, and the entire family is reunited when Laurie arranges for the surprise return of Mr. March. A few months later, Meg marries Mr. Brooke and Laurie asks Jo to marry him, but she turns him down, explaining that she is uncomfortable in high society and wishes to devote her life to writing. Greatly disappointed, Laurie leaves for Europe, and Jo, saddened by the seeming loss of both Meg and Laurie, who she considers to be her best friend, moves to New York to pursue her career. While boarding at the home of the Kirke family, Jo meets Professor Bhaer (Rossano Brazzi), the Kirke children's German tutor, who introduces her to art museums and the opera. Bhaer later agrees to read Jo's stories, but she is devastated when he later criticizes her work, dismissing it as sensationalistic. Bursting into tears, Jo reveals that she feels abandoned by Laurie and hurt that Aunt March, who had long promised her a trip to Europe, has taken Amy instead. After consoling Jo, with whom he has fallen in love, Professor Bhaer advises her to write from her heart, and Jo decides to return home where she is needed, for Beth is again very ill. Upon her return to the now nearly empty March household, Jo learns that her beloved Beth is dying and spends the next few weeks caring for the courageous girl, who bears her suffering without complaint. After Beth's death, Jo assuages her grief by writing a novel entitled My Beth, which she sends to Professor Bhaer for his opinion. Later, Meg, now the mother of twins, gently informs Jo that Laurie and Amy have fallen in love in Europe and are to be married. Although Jo is happy for the couple, she realizes for the first time how lonely she is and how much she wishes to be loved. A few weeks later, Laurie and Amy return as husband and wife, and the Marches joyfully celebrate the family's reunion. The festivities are interrupted when Professor Bhaer arrives with Jo's novel, which he has had published. However, when Laurie answers the door, Bhaer mistakenly assumes that Jo has married her friend; he politely declines Laurie's invitation to join the party, and departs. After Jo catches up to him, the two embrace and he proposes marriage. Jo happily accepts, then leads her future husband back to the warmth of the house, where her family awaits them.

Selznick was originally going to produce the film. Filming began in September 1946 but Selznick decided he could not tackle a major production so soon after the ordeal of filming Duel in the Sun (1946) so he sold the property and script to MGM. The cast for the David O. Selznick version included Jennifer Jones (Jo), Diana Lynn (Amy), Bambi Linn (Beth), Rhonda Fleming (Meg) and Anne Revere (Marmee). =Writing= * In this version, Beth March (Margaret O'Brien) is portrayed as being several years younger than Amy March (Elizabeth Taylor), while in the book she is a year older. * Instead of first meeting at a New Year's Eve party, Jo and Laurie first see each other when the March girls are taking their breakfast to the Hummels, and Jo visits Laurie while he is sick and confined to the house before as well. * When the girls attend the New Year's Eve party, all four of the girls go, rather than just Meg and Jo as presented in the novel. They leave early because Beth is upset over hearing from other people that Mrs. March had plans to marry them off well. * At the beginning of the book, when the March sisters are each given a dollar to spend at their pleasure, they all decide to buy something for their mother. In the film, while they eventually do buy presents for their mother, they initially purchase things for themselves. * In the book, Amy is pulled out of school when her teacher, Mr. Davis, strikes her across the hand with a ruler when she hides limes in her desk; but in the movie, she is in trouble for drawing pictures on her slate, and she is not struck. * Several other scenes are left out, such as the group picnic, when Amy falls through the ice after following Jo and Laurie to the river, and when Amy and Laurie fall in love in Europe. * Jo and Laurie, while best friends in the book‚ÄîJo even having a special nickname for him (\\"Teddy\\")‚Äîhave a still somewhat close but much less intimate relationship in the film. Release Originally intended as a 1948 release, the premiere of Little Women was delayed until March 1949, when it was presented as the Easter attraction at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It is believed that the reason for the delay was to make the movie part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Silver Anniversary Celebration. Little Women became one of the top-grossing films of 1949. According to MGM records it earned $3,425,000 in the US and Canada, and $2,495,000 overseas resulting in a profit of $812,000. Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that the first part of the film was \\"a pretty agreeable assortment of period fun and sentiment\\", but the latter part \\"got away from the scriptwriters\\" with a \\"perceptible deflation\\" in its spirit once it became serious. Of June Allyson's performance, Crowther wrote that \\"Comparisons of course, are odious, but if memory serves us well, she can't hold a bayberry candle to the Jo of Katharine Hepburn of fifteen years ago.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote that unlike the previous film version, the remake left him \\"dry-eyed\\" and agreed that Allyson \\"tries hard to be as diverting as Miss Hepburn was years ago, even to the extent of imitating her peculiar vocalizations every now and then, but somehow she isn't quite as persuasive as her predecessor.\\" Harrison's Reports called the film \\"wholesome entertainment, with great sentimental appeal,\\" but \\"beautiful as it is in its old-fashioned charm, human appeal, and comedy situations, its oozing sentiment, judged by present standards, seems out of tune.\\" A mostly positive review in Variety praised LeRoy's direction as \\"tasteful\\" and, while agreeing that the Victorian sentiment of the book was \\"too meticulously preserved\\" in the film and \\"a bit out of joint with our times,\\" found that Allyson's performance \\"dominates the film\\" and \\"shows that there is meat in the role for more than one actress.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 71% approval rating, based on five out of seven surveyed critics providing a positive review. =Accolades= ;Won * 1950 - Academy Award for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration (Color) (Cedric Gibbons, Paul Groesse, Edwin B.

It is the only district in East Tyrol. The district borders the Pinzgau (Salzburg) in the north, the districts Spittal an der Drau and Hermagor (both Carinthia) in the east, Veneto (Italy) in the south, and South Tyrol (Italy) in the west. The area of the district is 2,016.41 km¬≤, with a population of 48,833 (January 1, 2019), and population a density of 25 persons per km¬≤. The administrative center of the district is Lienz. In 1918 it was occupied by the Italian Army.In 1919, Trentino and South Tyrol were split from what is now the Austrian state of Tyrol in the Treaty of Saint-Germain (these three entities made up the old Austro-Hungarian county of Tyrol). Since this time, East Tyrol has been separated from North Tyrol by about 5 km of border between the federal state of Salzburg and South Tyrol. Accordingly, it forms an inner- Austrian exclave of the federal state of Tyrol. It was also the only part of modern Tyrol not occupied by France after World War II, instead forming part of the British zone.  Geography  The district comprises parts of the Puster Valley, the valleys Iseltal, Defereggen, Virgental, Kalser Tal, and the Tyrolean Gailtal. Mountain ranges in the district include parts of the Hohe Tauern with Venediger Group and Glockner Group, the Defereggen Alps, the Lienz Dolomits, and the Karnisch Alps. Shortest road connection to North Tyrol is the Felbertauern road (P1), and the Felbertauern tunnel (about 5.3 km). Lienz is located at a road junction between the federal Felbertauern road (B108), a road to the Puster Valley (B100) and South Tyrol, and a road to the Drautal valley and Carinthia.

It was the dominant American locomotive producer during most of that period, as well as the first major exporter of American locomotives, selling its popular 4-2-0 engines to railways in Europe and building the first locomotive used in South America. History =Origin= William Norris The company was started in 1832 as the American Steam Carriage Company by William Norris (1802-1867) and Major Stephen H. Long (1784-1864), a military topographical engineer and explorer. The two men had experimented with steam engine building for years and, as early as 1829, designed a locomotive to burn anthracite coal. Norris and Long also built an engine called the Black Hawk, which performed with partial success on the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad in the early 1830s. Major Long later left the firm and William Norris was joined by his brother Septimus, who patented several locomotive-related inventions. The two brothers reformed the enterprise into the Norris Locomotive Works. =Growth and success= Birmingham & Gloucester Railway One of the most historic events in railroading history occurred on July 10, 1836, when the Norris Brothers ran a test of a 4-2-0 locomotive on the Belmont Inclined Plane of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad. (The two-track incline ran from the Schuylkill River for 2,805 feet towards present-day Belmont Avenue, rising one foot in 15 for a total of 187 feet.) Named George Washington, the 14,400 pound engine hauled a load of 19,200 pounds (including 24 people riding on the tender and a freight car) up the grade at 15 miles per hour. This engine, the first in the world to ascend a hill by its own power, proved that a steam locomotive could climb a grade while pulling a load. So remarkable was this accomplishment that reports published in engineering journals emphatically doubted its occurrence. A second, more formal trial with an even greater load proved the engine's capabilities on July 19, 1836. Norris 4-2-0s were exported to England for the Lickey Incline about 1842, English manufacturers having declined to supply. Norris built the Lafayette for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad the following year based on plans of the George Washington. Named after the Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette, this new 4-2-0 engine was the B&O;'s first locomotive to feature a leading truck and may have been the first standardized production model locomotive in the entire world. Innovations included positioning of cylinders outside and adjacent to the smokebox with pistons connecting to the face of the drive wheels instead of a crank axle, the four- wheel swiveling pilot truck, inside bar frame support, and placement of the two drivers ahead of the firebox (this supposedly offered greater power output as more of the locomotive's weight rested on the drivers and therefore increased tractive effort). The Lafayette established the configuration that American steam locomotives would follow until the end of the steam era. The Tioga leaving the Norris Works in 1848. In 1847, the Norris Works built the first ten-wheel locomotive in America: the Chesapeake. Operated by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, this was also the world's first 4-6-0 locomotive. It weighed 22 tons and had 14¬Ω by 22 inch cylinders and driving wheels 46 inches in diameter. Initially a wood-burning locomotive, the Chesapeake was converted to burn anthracite coal in 1862, and ran for about another fifteen years. Some authorities claim that Septimus Norris came up with the design, but other sources attribute it to master builder John Brandt of the Erie Railway. There were nine Norris brothers altogether, six of them had been involved in locomotive building at some point. William Norris' enterprise was renamed Norris Brothers when brothers Richard and Octavius joined it in 1844 during a period of financial distress and reorganization that included William's gradual departure from the business. The firm later became Richard Norris and Son. Other locomotive factories, operated independently (and unsuccessfully) by various Norris brothers later opened in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Schenectady, New York. La Copiap√≥, the first locomotive in South America, was built by Norris in 1850 The Norris Locomotive Works sold many locomotives overseas, as noted above. This company was the first American exporter of locomotives‚Äîand perhaps of large mechanical devices generally. As early as 1840, thirty percent of the firm's production until then had been for foreign markets. Norris machines operated in England, France, the states of the German Confederation (including Prussia, Austria and Saxony), Belgium, Italy, Canada, Cuba and South America. (The Copiap√≥, built in 1850 for Chilean Railroad, was the first locomotive in all of South America.) These engines influenced contemporary and subsequent locomotive design in many of these countries. William Norris had several large-scale operating models constructed as presentation pieces to rulers of several nations. Such sovereigns included Tsar Nicholas of Russia and King Louis- Philippe of France, who was so pleased with his model that he gave Norris a gold medal and a handsome gold box. A quarter-sized 4-4-0 locomotive and tender were built for Commodore Matthew C. Perry to deliver as a gift on his second expedition to Japan in 1854. A small circular railway‚Äîwhich also included a miniature passenger car made by another manufacturer and a mile of track‚Äîwas set up near Yokohama. The Japanese soon could take the first train ride available in the Far East. =Demise= Commemorative Stone in the Washington Monument presented by the employees of the Norris Locomotive Works on Feb. 22, 1856 (Washington's Birthday). The 4-4-0 locomotive depicted bears the name Washington on its nameplate. Richard Norris and Son was the largest locomotive maker in the United States, if not the world, during the 1850s. Employing many hundreds of men, the factory consisted of some ten buildings spread over several city blocks at what is now the campus of the Community College of Philadelphia. The firm reached its peak in 1857-58, after which time, the Norris family seems to have lost interest in the business. Manufacturing quality and output fell during the Civil War and the plant closed in 1866, although deliveries continued for a year or two. The firm's factory complex was located in the area around 17th and Hamilton Streets, on several acres of what had once been the famous Bush Hill estate of Andrew Hamilton, used as a hospital during the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793. The site was near the right-of-way of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, which crossed through that part of Philadelphia just north of Callowhill Street. (This route was later owned by the Reading Railroad.) The property lay idle until the adjacent Baldwin Locomotive Works (which had surpassed Norris as the largest locomotive builder in the US) acquired the site in 1873. The Norris buildings stood until 1896, when part of the property was cleared for construction of the third United States Mint in Philadelphia. (Still standing, that building has been adapted as part of the Community College of Philadelphia.) Today, no trace of either the Norris or Baldwin factories remains in that part of Philadelphia.

The screenplay, by Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman, is based on the 1868-69 two- volume novel of the same name, by Louisa May Alcott. A sequel was released the following year, titled Little Men. This is the third screen adaptation of the book. It follows two silent versions, the first released in 1917 with Minna Grey and the second in 1918 with Dorothy Bernard. After this 1933 sound version came the 1949 Little Women, with June Allyson, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Lawford, the 1994 film Little Women, starring Winona Ryder, and the 2019 film Little Women featuring Saoirse Ronan. Plot Set in Concord, Massachusetts, during and after the American Civil War, the film is a series of vignettes focusing on the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters and their mother, affectionately known as Marmee (Spring Byington), while they await the return of their father (Samuel S. Hinds), who serves as a colonel and a chaplain in the Union Army. Spirited tomboy Jo (Katharine Hepburn), who caters to the whims of their well-to-do Aunt March (Edna May Oliver), dreams of becoming a famous author, and she writes plays for her sisters to perform for the local children. Amy (Joan Bennett) is pretty but selfish, Meg (Frances Dee) works as a governess, and sensitive Beth (Jean Parker) practices on her clavichord, an aging instrument sorely in need of tuning. The girls meet Laurie (Douglass Montgomery), who has come to live with his grandfather, Mr. Laurence (Henry Stephenson), the Marches' wealthy next- door neighbor. The Laurences invite them to a lavish party, where Meg meets Laurie's tutor, John Brooke (John Lodge). During the next several months John courts Meg, Jo's first short story becomes published, and Beth often takes advantage of Mr. Laurence's offer for her to practice on his piano. Marmee learns that her husband is recuperating in a hospital in Washington, D.C., after an injury, so she goes to Washington to care for him. During her absence Beth contracts scarlet fever from a neighbor's baby. She recovers, albeit in a weakened condition. The March parents return, and Meg marries John. Laurie confesses his love to Jo, who rejects him. When he snubs her in return, Jo moves to New York City to pursue her writing career, and she lives in a boarding house. There she meets Professor Bhaer (Paul Lukas), an impoverished German linguist. With his help and encouragement Jo improves her writing, and she resolves her confused feelings about Laurie. Beth, debilitated, is near to death, so Jo returns to Concord to be with Beth and her family during this time. After Beth dies, a grieving Jo learns that Amy, who accompanied Aunt March to Europe, has fallen in love with Laurie, accepted his proposal and they return, having married. Upon their return, Jo is happy for Laurie and Amy, indicating it has turned out as it always should have been. Professor Bhaer then arrives from New York City, and with him he brings Jo's manuscript for Little Women, which is soon to be published. He confesses his love to Jo and proposes. Jo accepts, welcoming him to the family.

Selznick received no screen credit, he returned to RKO from MGM to supervise the production as the last film left in his contract with the studio. The prime goal of director George Cukor was to emphasize the juxtaposition between sacrifice and family life in Little Women. At Hepburn's request, costume designer Walter Plunkett created a dress for her character copied from one worn by her maternal grandmother in a tintype Hepburn had. Plunkett also had to redesign several of Joan Bennett's costumes to conceal her advancing pregnancy, a condition Bennett intentionally had not mentioned to Cukor when he cast her in the film.Edwards, p. 109 Plunkett designed all of the costumes very thoughtfully, purposely shuffling clothing items between the March sisters in different scenes to emphasize both the family bond of sisters sharing and the reality that each girl would only have so many clothes but an individual's closet could be drastically expanded by sharing with siblings. Louise Closser Hale originally was scheduled to portray Aunt March, but after her death on July 26, 1933, Edna May Oliver assumed the role.Little Women (1933) profile, tcm.com; accessed June 27, 2017. The film was budgeted at $1 million, and 4,000 people worked on it during the yearlong production schedule. 3,000 separate items, including costumes, furnishings, and household appliances, were authenticated by research. Hobe Erwin, a former artist and interior decorator, was hired to oversee the set decoration, and he modeled the interior of the March home after Hillside, Louisa May Alcott's Massachusetts house. Exteriors were filmed at Lancaster's Lake in Sunland, Providencia Ranch in the Hollywood Hills, and the Warner Bros. Ranch in Pasadena. Original prints of the film employed the use of hand-coloring for fireplaces and candles. Release The film opened on November 16, 1933, at Radio City Music Hall where, despite being the coldest November 16 for 50 years, broke opening day records with 23,073 people attending. It earned over $100,000 during its first week of release. A record 451,801 people attended the three week run at the Music Hall before it moved to RKO's Center Theatre where a further 250,000 people attended in four weeks. It earned a total of $1,337,000 in domestic rentals. Worldwide it made $2,000,000 and made a profit of $800,000. RKO's timing of release was impeccable, as Depression audiences were ripe for the film's evocation of life in a simpler, more innocent and auspicious world. In addition, the film business had come under fire in 1932 and 1933 for presenting an abundance of violent and sexually titillating material. This film was the type that conservative people felt should be produced. They championed it, sent their children to see it, and made it part of school curricula. The film was re-released in 1938 and earned an additional $70,000 in rentals and $49,000 in profit. =Home media= The film was released on DVD for Region 1 markets (US, Canada, and US territories) on November 6, 2001, by Warner Home Video. Reception =Critical reception= Lobby card The film was overwhelmingly praised by critics upon its release. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote \\"The easy-going fashion in which George Cukor, the director, has set forth the beguiling incidents in pictorial form is so welcome after the stereotyped tales with stuffed shirts. It matters not that this chronicle is without a hero, or even a villain, for the absence of such worthies, usually extravagantly drawn, causes one to be quite contented to dwell for the moment with human hearts of the old-fashioned days. The film begins in a gentle fashion and slips away smoothly without any forced attempt to help the finish to linger in the minds of the audience.\\" Variety called it \\"a superbly human document, sombre in tone, stately and slow in movement, but always eloquent in its interpretations.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker declared it \\"an amazing triumph\\", and \\"a picture more intense, wrought with more feeling, than any other we are likely to see for a long time to come.\\" The New York World-Telegram credited the film \\"a stunningly clever job of recapturing on the screen all the simplicity and charm of its author\\", and wrote that Hepburn gave \\"an unforgettably brilliant performance and that once and for all she definitely proves how unlimited and effortless an actress she really is.\\" The New York American wrote \\"It is possible that with the passage of months the memory of Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of the sensitive, fiery Jo will be dimmed a bit, or somewhat superseded by later displays of histrionic genius. But at the moment, and for days, weeks, months to come, Miss Hepburn's characterization will stand alone on a pedestal of flaming brilliance.\\" TV Guide rated the film four stars, calling it \\"unabashedly sentimental\\" and \\"an example of Hollywood's best filmmaking.\\" It added \\"The sets, costumes, lighting, and direction by George Cukor all contribute greatly to this magnificent film, but the performances, especially Hepburn's, are what make the simple story so moving. There are laughs and tears aplenty in this movie, which presents a slice of American history in a way that children will find palatable. Released during the depths of the Depression, Little Women buoyed Americans' spirits. It still does.\\"Review, tvguide.com; accessed June 27, 2017.  Historical context  Little Women by Louisa May Alcott takes place in the midst of the Civil War (during the 1860s). By the time the 1933 film was made the United States was in the midst of Great Depression and would be fighting in World War II in the near future. References that were once meant to be about the Civil War became all too relatable for audiences. Especially at the beginning of the film, the constant emphasis on food, frugality, conservation, activism, social reform, and want for family and morality are just a short list of the ideals that transferred directly from the Civil War era to the mindsets of Americans in the Great Depression. Cukor's focus on hardship and relief partnered with intense familial commitment creates a nostalgic and sentimental picture of joyfulness, moral improvement, and social progression. The 1933 film became a trademark of ‚Äúan activist spirit grounded in unbreakable ties to family and community‚Äù as the March girls represent the hope and determination that was prominent during both the Civil War and the Great Depression. =Accolades= Husband-and-wife screenwriters Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture but lost to Cavalcade, and George Cukor lost the Academy Award for Best Director to Frank Lloyd for his direction of that film.

The MHSA is funded by imposing an additional one percent tax on individual, but not corporate, taxable income in excess of one million dollars. In becoming law on January 2005, the MHSA represents the latest in a Californian legislative movement, begun in the 1990s, to provide better coordinated and more comprehensive care to those with serious mental illness, particularly in underserved populations. Its claim of successes thus far, such as with the development of innovative and integrated Full Service Partnerships (FSPs), are not without detractors who highlight many problems but especially a lack of oversight, large amount of unspent funds, poor transparency, lack of engagement in some communities, and a lack of adherence to required reporting as challenges MHSA implementation must overcome to fulfill the law's widely touted potential. Background At one time, California was known for having a strong mental health system. Treatment was available for Medi-Cal recipients with few limitations on care. Legislators and voters have acknowledged the inadequacy of California's historically underfunded mental health system to care for the state's residents, especially those with serious mental illness, over the past few decades. In 1991, to build a more community- and county- based system of care, the California legislature instituted realignment, a delegation of the control over mental health funds and care delivery from state to county. This was followed by a succession of legislation targeted towards marginalized populations with high documented rates of mental illness, such as the homeless (AB 2034, in 1999) and the potentially violent mentally ill (Laura's Law, in 2002). However, with the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, California voters acted upon a widespread perception that state and county mental health systems were still in disrepair, underfunded, and requiring a systematic, organizational overhaul. This perception echoed a nationwide perspective, with the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in 2003 calling for fundamental transformation of the historically fragmented mental health system. The MHSA is California's attempt to lead the way in accomplishing such systemic reform. In the end, voter consciences were pricked by the well-organized and -funded campaign that displayed both the need (50,000 mentally ill homeless people, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness) and the promise (successes of past mental health initiatives) of increased funding for the mental health system. Then- Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg and Rusty Selix, executive director of the Mental Health Association in California, led the initiative by collecting at minimum 373,816 signatures, along with financial ($4.3 million) and vocal support from stakeholders. Though Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the business community were opposed to Proposition 63 because of the tax it would impose on millionaires, the opposition raised only $17,500. On November 2, 2004, Proposition 63 passed with 53.8% of the vote, with 6,183,119 voting for and 5,330,052 voting against the bill. Overview The voter-approved MHSA initiative provides for developing, through an extensive stakeholder process, a comprehensive approach to providing community based mental health services and supports for California residents. Approximately 51,000 taxpayers in California will be helping to fund the MHSA through an estimated $750 million in tax revenue during fiscal year 2005-06. The MHSA was an unprecedented piece of legislation in California for several reasons: * Its funding source, quantity, and allocation is dedicated for mental health services, including times of budget cuts to many other public programs * It was intended to engage communities in prioritizing which service elements would be funded. * It was focused on developing preventive and innovative programs to help transform the mental health care system in California. To accomplish its objectives, the MHSA applies a specific portion of its funds to each of six system-building components: * Community program planning and administration (10%) * Community services and supports (45%) * Capital (buildings) and information technology (IT) (10%) * Education and training (human resources) (10%) * Prevention and early intervention (20%) * Innovation (5%) Notably, none of the funds were to be used for programs with existing fund allocations, unless it was for a new element or expansion in those existing programs. 51% of the funds have to be spent on children's service The MHSA stipulates that the California State Department of Mental Health (DMH) will contract with county mental health departments (plus two cities) to develop and manage the implementation of its provisions. Oversight responsibility for MHSA implementation was handed over to the sixteen member Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) on July 7, 2005, when the commission first met. The MHSA specifies requirements for service delivery and supports for children, youths, adults and older adults with serious emotional disturbances and/or severe mental illnesses. MHSA funding will be made annually to counties to: * Define serious mental illness among children, adults and seniors as a condition deserving priority attention, including prevention and early intervention services and medical and supportive care * Reduce the long-term adverse impact on individuals, families and State and local budgets resulting from untreated serious mental illness * Expand the kinds of successful, innovative service programs for children, adults and seniors already established in California, including culturally and linguistically competent approaches for underserved population * Provide State and local funds to adequately meet the needs of all children and adults who can be identified and enrolled in programs under this measure * Ensure all funds are expended in the most cost-effective manner and services are provided in accordance with recommended best practices, subject to local and State oversight to ensure accountability to taxpayers and to the public Implementation Starting from enactment, implementation of the MHSA was intended to take six months; in reality, the process of obtaining stakeholder input for administrative rules extended this period by several months. By August 2005, 12 meetings and 13 conference calls involving stakeholders across the state resulted in the final draft of rules by which counties would submit their three-year plans for approval. Counties are required to develop their own three-year plan, consistent with the requirements outlined in the act, in order to receive funding under the MHSA. Counties are obliged to collaborate with citizens and stakeholders to develop plans that will accomplish desired results through the meaningful use of time and capabilities, including things such as employment, vocational training, education, and social and community activities. Also required will be annual updates by the counties, along with a public review process. County proposals will be evaluated for their contribution to achieving the following goals: * Safe and adequate housing, including safe living environments, with family for children and youths * Reduction in homelessness * A network of supportive relationships * Timely access to needed help, including times of crisis * Reduction in incarceration in jails and juvenile halls * Reduction in involuntary services, including reduction in institutionalization and out-of- home placements MHSA specifies three stages of local funding, to fulfill initial plans, three year plans, and long term strategies. No services would be funded in the first year of implementation. The DMH approved the first county plan in January 2006. Allocations for each category of funding were planned to be granted annually, based upon detailed plans with prior approval. However, an amendment to the MHSA, AB 100, which passed in March 2011, serves to streamline the DMH approval and feedback process to the counties, ostensibly to relieve the DMH of some of its administrative burden. Roles & Responsibilities While the county mental health departments are involved in the actual implementation of MHSA programs, the MHSA mandates that several entities support or oversee the counties. These include the State Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). =California State Department of Mental Health (DMH)= In accordance with realignment, the DMH approves county three- year implementation plans, upon comment from the MHSOAC, and passes programmatic responsibilities to the counties. In the first few months immediately following its passage, the DMH has: * Obtained federal approvals and Medi-Cal waivers, State authority, additional resources and technical assistance in areas related to implementation * Established detailed requirements for the content of local three year expenditure plans * Developed criteria and procedures for reporting of county and state performance outcomes * Defined requirements for the maintenance of current State and local efforts to protect against supplanting existing programs and their funding streams * Developed formulas for how funding will be divided or distributed among counties * Determined how funding will flow to counties and set up the mechanics of distribution * Established a 16-member Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC), composed of elected State officials and Governor appointees, along with procedures for MHSOAC review of county planning efforts and oversight of DMH implementation * Developed and published regulations and provide preliminary training to all counties on plan development and implementation requirements The DMH has directed all counties to develop plans incorporating five essential concepts: * Community collaboration * Cultural competence * Client/family-driven mental health system for older adults, adults and transition age youth and family-driven system of care for children and youth * Wellness focus, which includes the concepts of recovery and resilience * Integrated service experiences for clients and their families throughout their interactions with the mental health system The DMH, in assuming and asserting its primacy over MHSA implementation, has dictated requirements for service delivery and supports as follows: * Full Service Partnership (FSP) Funds - funds to provide necessary services and supports for initial populations * General System Development Funds - funds to improve services and infrastructure * Outreach and Engagement Funding - funds for those populations that are currently receiving little or no service =Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC)= The authors of the MHSA created the MHSOAC to reflect the consumer-oriented focus of the law, mandating at least two appointees with severe mental illness, two other family members of individuals with severe mental illness, and various other community representatives. This diverse commission holds the responsibility of approving county implementation plans, helping develop mental illness stigma-relieving strategies, and recommending service delivery improvements to the state on an as-needed basis. Whenever the commission identifies a critical issue related to the performance of a county mental health program, it may refer the issue to the DMH. The first meeting of the MHSOAC was held July 7, 2005, at which time Proposition 63 author Darrell Steinberg was selected unanimously by fellow commissioners as chairman, without comment or discussion. After accepting the gavel, Steinberg was roundly praised for devising Proposition 63's 'creative financing' scheme. Steinberg then said, \\"We must focus on the big picture,\\" and stated his priorities with regard to the implementation of the MHSA: * Prioritize prevention and early intervention, without falling into the trap of fail first service provision, * Address \\"the plight of those at risk of falling off the edge,\\" and to * Advocate for mental health services from his \\"bully pulpit.\\" MHSOAC commissioners In accordance with MHSA requirements, the Commission shall consist of 16 voting members as follows: # The Attorney General or his or her designee # The Superintendent of Public Instruction or his or her designee # The Chairperson of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee or another member of the Senate selected by the President pro Tempore of the Senate # The Chairperson of the Assembly Health Committee or another member of the Assembly selected by the Speaker of the Assembly # Twelve appointees of the Governor, who shall seek individuals who have had personal or family experience with mental illness, to include: ::* two persons with a severe mental illness ::* a family member of an adult or senior with a severe mental illness ::* a family member of a child who has or has had a severe mental illness ::* a physician specializing in alcohol and drug treatment ::* a mental health professional ::* a county Sheriff, ::* a Superintendent of a school district ::* a representative of a labor organization ::* a representative of an employer with less than 500 employees ::* a representative of an employer with more than 500 employees ::* a representative of a health care services plan or insurer State government appointees The initial government officials and designee appointed: * Senator Wesley Chesbro (Democrat), of Arcata, chair of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Developmental Disabilities and Mental Health. * Assemblyman Mark Ridley-Thomas (Dem), of Los Angeles, a member of the Assembly Health committee and former L.A. city councilman. * Attorney General Bill Lockyer, of Hayward, a former State Senator and Assemblyman. * Darrell Steinberg (Dem), of Sacramento, an attorney, the author of Proposition 63, former Assemblyman.

Henning is a member of the Career Technical Education Standards and Framework Advisory Group and the California Assembly Speaker's Commission on Labor Education. He represents labor. Current progress One unqualified success story from the MHSA thus far involves the implementation of Full Service Partnerships (FSPs) demonstrating the \\"whatever it takes\\" commitment to assist in individualized recovery \\\\- whether it is housing, \\"integrated services, flexible funding [such as for childcare], intensive case management, [or] 24 h access to care.\\" FSP interventions are based upon evidence from such programs as Assertive community treatment (ACT), which has effectively reduced homelessness and hospitalizations while bettering outcomes. But the FSP model looks more like that of the also-popular MHA Village in Long Beach, which is a center that offers more comprehensive services besides those specifically mental health-related. Beyond these guiding principles, however, there has not been much consensus over unifying strategies to define and implement an FSP - resulting in varying FSP structures across counties. Overall, though, the Petris Center, funded by the DMH and California HealthCare Foundation to evaluate the MHSA, has reported quantifiable improvements in many areas: * Homelessness rates * Entry rates into the criminal justice system * Suffering from illness * Daily functioning * Education rates * Employment rates * General satisfaction with FSPs Continued challenges According to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Surveys (CHIS) demonstrate continued mental health needs of almost two million Californians, about half of which were unmet in 2011. In spite of steady tax revenue ($7.4 billion raised as of September 2011) earmarked for the MHSA, the unremittingly high numbers of mentally ill who lack treatment contrast starkly with the implementation of new programs like the FSPs, which may cost tens of thousands of dollars annually per person. The MHA Village program, for example, averages around $18,000 annually per person. One of the major growing concerns regarding MHSA implementation is its unintentional but worrying tendency to create silos of care. As directed by the DMH, counties search for \\"unserved\\" mentally ill or at-risk individuals to enroll in their new programs, while keeping existing and perhaps underserved clients in old programs that are usually underfunded, but cannot take MHSA funds. Ironically, while the MHSA was established in part to address racial/ethnic disparities in health care, it may be perpetuating the disparity in services delivery between underfunded and well-funded, new programs. A possible solution to this issue highlights another challenge for the MHSA: the need for more comprehensive evaluation, oversight, and advisory mechanisms. Though there is an accountability commission, the MHSOAC, its oversight and regulatory responsibilities are not well-defined. However, it is a relatively new entity, having been created by the MHSA in 2004, and has yet to fully delineate its role in the MHSA. With time, the MHSOAC will hopefully continue to develop towards its stated function. Objective and expert evaluation of the MHSA will also be necessary to achieve the kind of longstanding system-wide improvement that then becomes a model for others.

He was the founder of Tennessee Temple University and Temple Baptist Seminary in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Camp Joy, in Harrison, Tennessee. Early life Roberson was born in a two-room log cabin and spent his first two years on a farm near English, Indiana, a small town in the southern part of the state. Originally named Leverne Edward, he was known throughout his life as \\"Lee.\\"High School diploma of Leverne Edward Roberson, Louisville Male High School, Louisville, Kentucky In 1911, his parents, Charles E. and Dora (Sego) Roberson, took him to a farm near Louisville, Kentucky, where his father farmed, worked on streetcars, and built homes to make a living. In 1923, at the age of fourteen, he was led to the Lord by his Sunday School teacher, Mrs. Daisy Hawes, and joined the Cedar Creek Baptist Church near Louisville. Education After spending two years at the Louisville Male High School, where he received a diploma in public accounting when he was fourteen years old, Roberson then attended the Fern Creek High School, where he played football and graduated after four years. Roberson entered Old Bethel College in Russellville, Kentucky, in 1926, and completed one year there. There he worked at various jobs from washing dishes to scrubbing floors to pay his way. From Old Bethel College, he went to the University of Louisville to complete his college work with a major in history. He also continued his education at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, where he studied under Dr. A.T. Robertson. At the age of nineteen, he was called by a church in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, but he did not accept. In his early years, Roberson was well known as a singer. Having studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and with the well-known teacher, John Samples, of Chicago, his services as a vocalist were in great demand. He served as a soloist on the staff of radio station WHAS of Louisville and WSM in Nashville, Tennessee. Roberson was offered a contract by Gaetano Salvatore de Luca at the Nashville Conservatory of Music. After a discussion with de Luca, Roberson decided to give up musical performance, and declined on the grounds that such a music career was not in accordance with his divine calling to the ministry.Roberson, Lee. Double-Breasted, Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Sword of the Lord Publishers, 1977 (p.36) Ministry The first church that Roberson served as pastor was in Germantown, Tennessee, while he was in college. In 1932, he was called to be pastor of the Temple Baptist Church in Greenbrier, Tennessee. It was there that he began emphasizing the Second Coming of Christ. After three years with the Greenbrier church, Roberson entered full-time evangelistic work in 1935. He served as evangelist of the Birmingham Baptist Association. Within two years he had conducted some fifty revivals in the Birmingham area. In Birmingham, he met Caroline Allen, who, on October 9, 1937, became Mrs. Lee Roberson. On the first Sunday in November 1937, Roberson became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Fairfield, Alabama. In 1939, Roberson was asked to be the state evangelist for Alabama, but he declined. After five years with the Fairfield church, Roberson was called by the Highland Park Baptist Church in Chattanooga in November 1942. Four years later, Roberson founded Tennessee Temple University and Zion College. Two years later in 1948, a theological seminary, Southeastern Baptist Seminary (later renamed Temple Baptist Seminary in 1954) was added. His ministry would continue to branch out to radio, a citywide bus ministry, and the founding of Camp Joy. Highland Park Baptist Church would grow, at one point, to be one of the largest churches in the United States. He preached his last service as pastor of Highland Park Baptist Church on April 27, 1983, but continued preaching across the nation and publishing many books. He continued this work until his death.

Its chemical formula is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Maleic acid is the cis-isomer of butenedioic acid, whereas fumaric acid is the trans-isomer. It is mainly used as a precursor to fumaric acid, and relative to its parent maleic anhydride, maleic acid has few applications.  Physical properties  Maleic acid has a heat of combustion of -1,355 kJ/mol.Maleic Anhydride, Maleic Acid, and Fumaric Acid , Huntsman Petrochemical Corporation, 22.7 kJ/mol higher than that of fumaric acid. Maleic acid is more soluble in water than fumaric acid. The melting point of maleic acid (135 ¬∞C) is also much lower than that of fumaric acid (287 ¬∞C). Both properties of maleic acid can be explained on account of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that takes place in maleic acid at the expense of intermolecular interactions, and that are not possible in fumaric acid for geometric reasons. Production and industrial applications In industry, maleic acid is derived by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride, the latter being produced by oxidation of benzene or butane.Kurt Lohbeck, Herbert Haferkorn, Werner Fuhrmann and Norbert Fedtke \\"Maleic and Fumaric Acids\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. Maleic acid is an industrial raw material for the production of glyoxylic acid by ozonolysis.DSM glyoxylic acid production Maleic acid may be used to form acid addition salts with drugs to make them more stable, such as indacaterol maleate. Maleic acid is also used as an adhesion promoter for different substrates, such as nylon and zinc coated metals e.g galvanized steel, in methyl methacrylate based adhesives. =Isomerization to fumaric acid= The major industrial use of maleic acid is its conversion to fumaric acid. This conversion, an isomerization, is catalysed by a variety of reagents, such as mineral acids and thiourea. Again, the large difference in water solubility makes fumaric acid purification easy. The isomerization is a popular topic in schools. Maleic acid and fumaric acid do not spontaneously interconvert because rotation around a carbon carbon double bond is not energetically favourable. However, conversion of the cis isomer into the trans isomer is possible by photolysis in the presence of a small amount of bromine.Light isomerization experiment (from the University of Regensburg, with video) Light converts elemental bromine into a bromine radical, which attacks the alkene in a radical addition reaction to a bromo-alkane radical; and now single bond rotation is possible. The bromine radicals recombine and fumaric acid is formed. In another method (used as a classroom demonstration), maleic acid is transformed into fumaric acid through the process of heating the maleic acid in hydrochloric acid solution. Reversible addition (of H+) leads to free rotation about the central C-C bond and formation of the more stable and less soluble fumaric acid. Some bacteria produce the enzyme maleate isomerase, which is used by bacteria in nicotinate metabolism. This enzyme catalyses isomerization between fumarate and maleate. Other reactions Although not practised commercially, maleic acid can be converted into maleic anhydride by dehydration, to malic acid by hydration, and to succinic acid by hydrogenation (ethanol / palladium on carbon). It reacts with thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride to give the maleic acid chloride (it is not possible to isolate the mono acid chloride). Maleic acid, being electrophilic, participates as a dienophile in many Diels-Alder reactions.  Maleates The maleate ion is the ionized form of maleic acid. The maleate ion is useful in biochemistry as an inhibitor of transaminase reactions. Maleic acid esters are also called maleates, for instance dimethyl maleate. =Use in pharmaceutical drugs= Many drugs that contain amines are provided as the maleate acid salt, e.g. carfenazine, chlorpheniramine, pyrilamine, methylergonovine, and thiethylperazine.

Archaeological artefacts The island was known in ancient tiles as Setet, and there are many archaeological sites, including sacred places, such as the temple of Anuket, the Egyptian water goddess, and goddess of the Nile's cataracts. Seheil was home to a stone quarry for granite used during various Ancient Egyptian eras, and there are many inscriptions in the island's granite boulders. These inscriptions were usually left by travellers marking either the start or end of their journey to Nubia. There are several famous inscriptions that record ancient historical events. One is the Famine Stela, which is of Greco-Roman origin, but claims to record events from the time of Djoser and Imhotep.

He worked on some of the best- remembered 1960s television shows including Ivanhoe, The Saint, The Avengers, Riptide and Doctor Who. Early life Born in Australia, Bill Strutton won a state scholarship to university at 14 but dropped out after two years to go and work as an office clerk in Adelaide. At the outbreak of WWII he joined the Australian army. He was captured by the Germans in Crete and sent to Stalag VII, learning to swear in several languages. It was there he also began to take an interest in writing. He says: \\"My first year as a prisoner-of-war was the most interesting in my life. The ensuing three were the most boring, but more instructive, I think, than any university. I learned several languages: German from a Serbian horse-doctor; Spanish from a Basque; a Parisian taxi- driver bequeathed me a startling vocabulary. I also ran a camp newspaper, caught up on my reading, and finally celebrated my liberation by tearing up a novel.\\" After being demobbed, he lived in England. In 1961 he lived with his Australian wife, Marguerite and two children in Woddingham, East Surrey. Career After the war he took up journalism as a career and in the mid- fifties he began writing military books, including The Secret Invaders, A Jury of Angels in 1957 and Island of Terrible Friends in 1961. Also, three films. In 1958 he scripted Ivanhoe, which starred a young Roger Moore. He wrote for more than 15 television series in 11 years, the last of which was Strange Report, starring Anthony Quayle, and several episodes of Paul Temple before retiring in 1978 following a heart attack. His Doctor Who story was The Web Planet in 1965. It is remembered as a unique Doctor Who serial. It was the first programme to feature a completely alien cast, including Martin Jarvis as a butterfly Menoptera, and introduced the menacing Zarbi. Two of its six episodes are amongst the handful of Doctor Who instalments to be seen by more than 13m people on original transmission. Bill Strutton went on to adapt the serial as the third Doctor Who book in 1965. In 1972, Strutton submitted another storyline to Doctor Who entitled The Mega but this was rejected and was later adapted as an audio drama that was released in 2013. Death Bill Strutton died on 23 November 2003, the day of Doctor Who's 40th anniversary, aged 85 years.

It welcomes all Native American tribes of the Great Plains to its festivities, functioning as a \\"giant family reunion under the Big Sky.\\" Indeed, it is currently the largest Northern Native American gathering, attracting nearly 45,000 spectators and participants. Crow Fair is \\"the teepee capital of the world, over 1,500 teepees in a giant campground,\\" according to 2011 Crow Fair General Manager Austin Little Light. Held annually the third week of August on land surrounding the Little Big Horn River near Billings, Montana, Crow Fair is very similar to a County Fair. It serves as a venue for the display of the region's arts and culture, from craft jewelry for sale to physical feats of dance. The Parade The Crow Fair traditionally includes its own unique version of a parade. The parade begins each morning of the Fair at ten o'clock. The Color Guard leads the parade with retired veterans and active members of the armed services. Following the Color Guard are the President, Vice-President, and First Vice-President of the Crow Fair. The President carries the American Flag. In the past, the royalty of the Crow Nation would follow the Presidents; however, in modern parades the Crow Tribal Officials replace Crow royalty. The majority of participants in the parade are essentially members of the Crow Nation, dressed in traditional wear with eagle feathers, warbonnets, old-time saddles, western saddles, reservation hats, and extravagant beadwork. The beadwork of the Crow Nation is among the most technically proficient in the world. The parade takes place on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the Crow Fair. The Sunday parade involves the greatest number of participants, and may extend as long as 1.5 miles in length. Dance Celebration Crow Fair hosts one of several Dance Celebrations. The Crow Dance Celebration, commonly known as a pow-wow, is held every late afternoon and evening during the fair. The Crow Nation makes the distinction that dancing is the most fundamental form of celebration, as members may come to the dance arena simply for the pure joy elicited by dancing. However, pow-wows do often involve competition dancing.  Rodeo  The Crow Fair Rodeo is sponsored annually by the Crow Nation. The rodeo is a daily feature at the Crow Fair, offering a full day's entertainment of youth events, professional Indian cowboys and cowgirls, and horse racing. The Northern Plains Indian Rodeo Association, organized under the Indian National Finals Rodeo, is the current association that sanctions the rodeo event. The Crow Fair Rodeo is held at the Edison Real Bird Memorial Complex, in Crow Agency, Montana. The rodeo arena, race track, stables, and campgrounds are all part of this complex. Committee On the last day of the Crow Fair week, the Crow Nation annually elects a new committee to organize the next Crow Fair Dance Celebration, Rodeo, and Racemeet. The Tuesday morning and afternoon is filled with campcriers and announcers telling the campgrounds via megaphone of the candidates. Campcriers are hired by candidates to notify the campground of their candidacy. Often, rumors are flying before and during the Crow Fair regarding which individuals will run for election for the committee.

With shutters set to \\"B\\", the pneumatic release kept the shutter open for as long as the photographer squeezed the bulb‚Äîa \\"Bulb\\" exposure. The Bulb setting (abbreviated B) on camera shutters is a momentary-action mode that holds shutters open for as long as a photographer depresses the shutter-release button. The Bulb setting is distinct from shutter's Time (T) setting, which is an alternate-action mode where the shutter opens when the shutter-release button is pressed and released once, and closes when the button is actuated again. History Decades before the first flashbulbs, some box cameras and many view cameras and folding cameras came with a detachable pneumatic shutter release with a rubber bulb on the end; \\"Bulb\\" refers to the rubber shutter release bulb. Though mechanically timed exposures could also be triggered by squeezing the shutter release bulb, \\"Bulb\\" exposures then had the same momentary action as camera shutters have today, as per this description from Sears Roebuck's 1909 Cameras [&] Photographic Supplies: Around 1894 in Germany, the momentary-action setting on camera shutters made by C. A. Steinheil & S√∂hne in Munich were denoted with \\"B\\" but the literature referred to it as Beliebig (meaning beliebige Zeit, ). The Eastman Kodak Company sold entry level consumer cameras that did not have the option of a pneumatic shutter release. Though Kodak retained the convention of using \\"B‚Äù on shutters to denote the setting that provides momentary actuation, they referred to it as \\"Brief Time\\" in brochures for cameras like their Folding Autographic Brownies, as well as in instruction manuals for products like their 1 & 1A Pocket \\"Kodaks\\" Juniors. \\"Brief time\\" was also used in reference works like Newnes Photographers' Pocket Reference Book (1955). Use Long exposure: 30 sec: insect flights in the night in front of a spotlight. The bulb setting is used on some cameras, including some point-and-shoot cameras, to obtain shutter speeds slower than the minimum offered by the camera otherwise. Because of the risk of camera movement, the camera is most often mounted on a tripod for the duration of the exposure. While it is generally possible to use the shutter release button on the camera itself, a cable release or electronic remote is often used to further eliminate the risk of shaking the camera during long exposures. The cable releases generally include a locking feature to eliminate the need to keep the button or plunger depressed during extremely long exposures. The bulb setting is useful for the following types of photographic subjects: * fireworks at night * the night sky and celestial objects (see astrophotography) * lightning * streets at night (creating streaks from moving cars) * light painting On modern cameras On some modern cameras, bulb is a mode available as an option on the LCD menu only, if possible at all. On others, including many Digital SLR cameras, bulb is typically available from the manual exposure mode and-- rarely--also from shutter priority mode. When set to bulb, generally on the \\"M\\" or manual setting of the camera, the shutter will stay open as long as the shutter release button (or shutter release cable or remote) remains depressed. Some mid-level or bridge cameras such as the Olympus SP-560UZ have a 'limited' bulb setting, allowing time exposures up to 8 minutes and at an ISO setting of 200 ISO and lower. In 2012, Olympus introduced a new form of bulb mode with their \\"Live Bulb\\" (without toggle) and \\"Live Time\\" (with toggle) settings in their Olympus OM-D E-M5 digital camera, where the viewfinder and display gets updated during the exposure in order to allow the photographer to inspect the exposure while it \\"develops\\". The display refresh rate for this mode can be configured between 0.5 s and 60 s. Some specialized cameras use other image triggers.

According to oral sources Sundiata's brother, Manding Bory Keita (alias Abubakari Keita I), was supposed to ascend to the throne since Uli was too young to ascend the throne the time of his father's death. Instead, the ambitious prince seized the throne for himself in 1255 and began a campaign of territorial expansion into West Africa. Mansa Uli Keita also significantly increased the empire's agricultural production. On an economic and political level, Uli set a precedent by making the Hajj to Mecca during his reign. Unlike his father, Mansa Wali had no blood heirs, which left the throne to be fought over by his adopted brothers.

Z. Knight, who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on these channeling sessions. History In 1988, J. Z. Knight founded Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE), then called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment: The American Gnostic School, on her estate in Yelm, Washington. A division of Knight's company JZK, Inc., the school had around 80 staff members . According to RSE's website, it is an \\"academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of all ages and cultures\\". RSE's private, fenced compounds are only open to staff members and students, not to the public. In 2004, various Ramtha school leaders joined community groups to strongly oppose a proposed 75,000-seat NASCAR racetrack in Yelm. The proposal was withdrawn. In 2007, Knight's profits from the school's activities and from sale of books, tapes, CDs and DVDs had reportedly been around $2.6 million. In 2008, lessons were given to the public in more than 20 countries, including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile for the first time. Teachings Gate to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment northwest of Yelm, Washington. The school teaches that human beings have the capacity to utilize their inner wisdom, focus their brains, and create their own reality. The school's curriculum is based on the channelings by Knight of the entity Ramtha. Although the school has been criticised for being a cult (see below), Knight and her followers deny such claims and say that the school is neither a religion nor a cult. Ramtha's School of Enlightenment teachings have been described as part of the New Age movement (the school itself claims to be outside it). A controversial religious scholar, J. Gordon Melton, wrote a book countering this argument called Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom. Lessons in the school's compounds sometimes include wine drinking, tobacco pipe smoking and dancing to rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll music. Allegedly, it is being taught that the nitric oxide in red wine (not the alcohol), also found in pipe tobacco (not the nicotine), can help to facilitate changes in the brain as a part of the process in which to achieve these means. Through various focus techniques, the students believe they are on their way to becoming as \\"enlightened\\" as other shamans who can alter their personal reality at will. The main activities towards that goal vary from specific focusing, meditation-like techniques, breathing techniques, blindfolded archery, energy healing (for one's self and for someone else), finding the heart of a maze, and many more. The students are taught that human beings can train themselves into such powers that will allow them to levitate, raise the dead, make gold appear in their hand and predict the future. Eventually this may lead to the \\"ascension\\" of the physical body into the \\"light body\\". Other skills allegedly obtained by attending the lessons include psychokinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, and other ESP skills, which have been criticized by various skeptics around the world. The dialogues, and a lot of transcripts from Knight's Ramtha talks, have been compiled and published over the course of many years. Videotapes of various dialogue sessions have also been released. While some major themes in the school's teachings are covered in these publications, more in-depth and systematic presentation of its philosophies and teachings is only accessible by attending a retreat in person. Research In February 1997, Knight hosted a conference of scholars who had been studying her, the students and the school for the previous year. During their research phase, they also observed Knight's Ramtha sessions and measured various physiological functions of her body. The researchers examined Ramtha's teachings and the school's practices from a variety of perspectives, including physics, feminism, parapsychology and religion. Melton organized the research. In addition to the conference presenters, Knight invited the media to attend. However, Knight said she did not sponsor the conference to gain publicity or to convince her skeptics. Knight paid the travel expenses and stipends for the conference presenters, which caused some of Knight's critics to suggest she had influenced their research. The researchers denied this contention to the press and, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, \\"were offended by a suggestion that the New Age spiritualist could have tried to buy their support\\". Apart from the conference proceedings, two papers were published. In 1998, Stanley Krippner published a paper on the psychological, phenomenological and geomagnetic results of the various studies. In 2009, Joan Hageman published a paper examining the results of the physiological testing on Knight and six students. Controversy and criticism Ramtha's School of Enlightenment has been called a cult by various people, including her former husband Jeff Knight, former personal bodyguard Glen Cunningham, former students of the school (such as David McCarthy or Joe Szimhart), and skeptic Michael Shermer. Melton's book, which denies the school's status as a cult, has been criticized for siding with the school and not providing a neutral description of what is going on within the school. He has also been called a \\"cult apologist\\" by various opposers of cults. His position was further criticized when he took the stand as a witness in the case of Knight v. Knight (1992‚Äì1995) against Jeff Knight (JZ Knight's husband at the time), by further supporting that the school is not a cult. WA 510. The entrance to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment is in the background on the left. Former students of the school have accused the RSE of practicing brain-washing and mind-control, as well as using intimidation and fear techniques to keep students in the school. David McCarthy, a student of the RSE between 1989 and 1996, calls Knight a \\"spiritual predator\\", and he mentions various parts of the teachings which had an intimidative character, such as the prophecy that unless students remain faithful to Ramtha, they will become prey of the \\"lizard people\\", and that the ancient figure of Jehovah would return to earth accompanied by lizard people, in a spaceship. The former students (including David McCarthy and Joe Szimhart) have formed an online community, Life After RSE (LARSE), to provide support for people who have quit the school and find themselves lost. A further controversial issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called \\"days to come\\", which were prophesied earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha were given to the students, telling them to leave the cities, find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families. Various incidents within the school's grounds have been characterized as controversial. Glen Cunningham, in an interview with David McCarthy, describes how, one evening, Knight suggested that all students should stay there overnight because she said it would be \\"good for the energy\\". That was before the Great Arena (formerly used as horse stables) had been floored, and as a result there would be a lot of dust in the air. Cunningham says that there was a very old woman among the students, who begged him that she did not want to do this and she wanted to go home, but Ramtha said that she could stay under the protection of Ramtha and her bodyguard. Leaving the arena the following day, the old woman died of pneumonia (due to the dust in the air and humidity). Another incident which is mentioned by both Cunningham and Joe Szimhart is the practice of running blindfolded in a large fenced field. Szimhart mentions in particular an occasion around the year 1990, in which about 1,000 blindfolded students were directed to split up and run across the field, with their hands in the \\"Consciousness & Energy\\" position in front of them, and the exercise was meant to help the students overcome their fears. Szimhart recalls how many people crashed into each other, and that there were some injuries. A customer of his ended up with a deeply bruised shoulder and a big lump on his forehead. Aside from the minor injuries, a few people had to be treated at the hospital. In 2011, Knight stated (while at the RSE supposedly channeling Ramtha), \\"Fuck God‚Äôs chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now\\", and said that Mexican people \\"breed like rabbits\\" and are \\"poison,\\" that all gay men used to be Catholic priests, and that organic farmers have bad hygiene. In 2012, videos of this were placed on the Internet by ex-students of Knight's and by the Freedom Foundation.  Related projects  In 2004, three members of the RSE produced a controversial film that combined documentary interviews and a fictional narrative to posit a connection between science and spirituality, called What the Bleep Do We Know!?. The film has been criticized by the scientific community due to its mis-representation of quantum physics, and an unnecessary connection to consciousness. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a \\"pseudoscientific docudrama\\", saying \\"Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought.\\" See also * Anti-cult movement * New Religious Movement * Pseudoskepticism * Skepticism References External links  Category:New Age organizations Category:New religious movements Category:Thurston County, Washington Category:Mysticism Category:Parapsychology ","title":"Ramtha's School of Enlightenment"},{"id":"2175768","text":"Pujehun District is a district in the Southern Province of Sierra Leone.

While the brand churned out 720 million hot dogs in 2009, the New York Times wrote a year later that they \\"aren't kosher enough for most Jews who keep kosher.\\" In 1982, Hebrew National opened a non-kosher division under the name National Deli; it was sold off in 2001, and is now based in Florida. History The Hebrew National Kosher Sausage Factory, Inc., was founded on East Broadway, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1905. The company was founded by Theodore Krainin, who emigrated from the Russian Empire in the 1880s. By 1921, the factory was registered as government inspected establishment #552 by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry with Theodore Krainin as proprietor. Alfred W. McCann writing in a 1921 Globe and Commercial Advertiser article cited Hebrew National as having \\"higher standards than the law requires.\\" McCann wrote the article during a crusade for commercial food decency standards, in which the Globe was prominent. He wrote, \\"More power to Krainin and the decency he represents! Such evidence of the kind of citizenship which America should covet is not to be passed by lightly.\\"Alfred W. McCann in The Globe and Commercial Advertiser, Thursday, July 28, 1921 Hebrew National \\"served the Jewish neighborhoods of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Germany and soon developed a favorable reputation among the other Jewish residents of New York City.\\" Previous logo bearing famous slogan We answer to a higher authority In 1934, after a bankruptcy action, the certificate of incorporation for Hebrew National Sausage Factory listed Solomon Levinson, Sylvia Marans and Miriam Spector, all of Brooklyn, as directors and shareholders. In 1937 after an increase in capital stock, Jacob Pinkowitz was listed as an officer.Diversified Corporate Services Int'l Inc. Albany, N.Y. Reference # 02923. The company was bought by Jewish Romanian immigrant butcher Isadore Pines (born Pinkowitz). In 1935, Isadore's son, Leonard Pines, took over the business.Phyllis Berman, Why Pastrami and Soap Don't Mix. Forbes December 2, 1985. In 1965, Hebrew National came up with the slogan that they've used ever since: We answer to a higher authority ‚Äî a reference to Jewish dietary laws and a claim to higher quality that was able to appeal to both Jewish and non-Jewish markets. In 1968, the Pines family sold Hebrew National to Riviana Foods, which was taken over by Colgate- Palmolive in 1976. In 1980, Isidore \\"Skip\\" Pines, grandson of Isidore, bought the company from Colgate-Palmolive for a fraction of the price it was originally sold for. The health food movement of the 1980s encouraged the company to stick to a recipe that used no artificial colors or flavors, and to minimize other potential modernizations of the recipe. This strategy ultimately proved successful, and with a growing revenue, Hebrew National hoped to transform itself into a large conglomerate through acquiring other brands, in order to compete with the food giants that dominated the industry. Hebrew National developed a non-kosher brand called \\"National Deli\\". This strategy was less successful, and National Foods was acquired by ConAgra Foods in 1993. The National Deli brand was sold off in 2001 to a former Hebrew National employee, and still operates out of Miami, Florida. Location The site of Hebrew National's manufacturing plant had been New York City for many years; it moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1989. The Indianapolis plant was closed down in 2004 as operations were consolidated with the ConAgra Foods Armour hot dog plant in Quincy, Michigan. Kosher supervision The majority of Hebrew National beef products are consumed by non-Jews. The Jewish Daily Forward wrote in 2004, that then-recent changes in supervision are \\"unlikely to translate into a significant increase in sales.\\" Despite Hebrew National being described as \\"the largest, most recognized kosher brand in the United States\\" as of \\"the middle of the twentieth century,\\" the company's level of being kosher \\"did not seem to impress yeshiva-educated elements of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\" For many years, Hebrew National relied on a body within the company to certify its products kosher. Many Orthodox Jews did not feel that Hebrew National's kosher standards were up to those set in place by groups such as the Orthodox Union, Kof-K, and others, and therefore did not consume Hebrew National beef-based products. Standards and opinions differed for Hebrew National's poultry. The Conservative movement also did not regard Hebrew National as kosher. Rabbi Paul Plotkin, the chair of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards' Kashrut Committee, wrote that \\"Until recently, Hebrew National, which is widely distributed, wasn't 'kosher enough.' Its supervision was unacceptable to many Jews who keep kosher including the Conservative movement.\\"Rabbi Paul Plotkin, Kosher Enough: A New Look at Kashrut . United Synagogue Review Fall 2005. In the early 2000s, Hebrew National switched to an external certification group, Triangle K, under the auspices of Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, which was widely seen as an upgrade in its standards of kashrut. In 2004, the Conservative movement found the upgrade sufficient to be acceptable. Rabbis Ralbag and Plotkin conferred jointly and developed a strategy for consistent monitoring of the products labeled kosher by Hebrew National. By reducing production facilities to just one location, expenses were dramatically reduced for upkeep, utilities, employees, and maintenance. The production process was streamlined so that a viewing station kept an eye on each individual sausage that passed through the facility. Rabbis Plotkin and Ralbag share monitoring duties amongst a group of other rabbis, allowing for a reliable dedication to the purveyance of kosher hot dogs. Hebrew National hot dogs are, in this way, able to claim their product as kosher. In a blog post on the subject, Conservative rabbi and kosher certification entrepreneur Jason Miller lamented the fact that in several baseball stadiums in the United States, Hebrew National hot dogs are publicized as kosher \\"when in fact they are cooked on the same grill as the non-kosher hot dogs and sausages\\" and served on dairy hot dog buns.Rabbi Jason Miller Blog: \\"Are Hebrew National Hot Dogs Kosher?\\" June, 2012.

Club career Bernier played for the original Montreal Impact in the A-league in Canada. For two seasons he played college soccer in the United States, for Syracuse University, in New York. He has some background in hockey, but he was told he was too short to reach the top level. He joined Norwegian side Moss F.K. to play alongside compatriot Rob Friend at the start of the 2003 season. =Troms√∏= Bernier with Canada in 2010 Bernier signed for Troms√∏ in the summer of 2004.

The company was founded in 1888, in Sebastopol, California, as the Hunt Bros. Fruit Packing Co. by Joseph and William Hunt. The brothers relocated to nearby Santa Rosa in 1890, and then to Hayward in 1895. This small canning operation grew rapidly, focused on canning the products of California's booming fruit and vegetable industries. By 1941, the plant shipped a hundred million cans of soup, fruits, vegetables, and juices annually.Workers of the Writers' Program. \\"Los Angeles: A Guide to the City and its Environs\\". Hastings House, 1941, page. 346. In 1943, Hunt's was taken over by Norton Simon's Val Vita Food Products - a competing firm founded in the early 1930s and based in Fullerton, California. The merged firm kept the Hunt's name and incorporated as Hunt Food and Industries, Inc. The new management decided to focus the company on canned tomato products, particularly prepared tomato sauce. The Wesson Oil & Snowdrift Company merged with Hunt's Foods, Inc. in 1960 to become Hunt-Wesson Foods. Hunt-Wesson merged with the McCall Corporation and Canada Dry to form Norton Simon Inc. in 1968. Norton Simon was acquired by Esmark in 1983, which merged with Beatrice Foods the next year. In 1985, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired Beatrice with the goal of selling off businesses. Hunt-Wesson, the company which included the Hunt's brands, was sold in 1990 to agribusiness giant ConAgra Foods. In 1999, ConAgra Grocery Products (the former Hunt-Wesson) moved from Fullerton to Irvine, California. The Irvine office was closed in 2006. Besides several varieties of canned tomato sauce, the Hunt's brand appears on tomato paste, diced, whole, stewed, pureed and crushed tomatoes, organic and No Salt Added tomato products, spaghetti sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce, canned potatoes, canned peaches and Hunt's Family Favorites line of canned recipe helpers. The Hunt's brand name also appears on Manwich brand sloppy joes products and formerly Hunt's Snack Pack Pudding. Reddi-wip whipped cream was originally also under the Hunt's banner. In May 2010, Hunt's ketchup temporarily removed high fructose corn syrup from its ingredients. The new ingredients were \\"tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, salt and other seasonings\\". The product changed back to high fructose corn syrup in May 2012. As of May 2017 the sugar based version has been available for some time in the US, labeled as 100% Natural Tomato Ketchup and in the specific sizes; 20 oz, 28 oz, 38.5 oz, and 62 oz. In December 2018, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes II signed an endorsement deal with Hunt's. Mahomes is well-known for his love of ketchup, putting it on his steak and his macaroni. See also * H. J.

Early life There is scant information about the life of Krishna Dasa Kaviraja Goswami. Krishna Dasa was born in 1496 CE in a family of Baidya physicians in the village of Jhamatpur, within the district of Bardhaman, West Bengal. His father was called Bhagiratha, and his mother was named Sunanda. He also had a younger brother named Shyamananda Dasa. Both his parents died when he was young, thus he and his brother were raised by relatives. Instructions Krishna Dasa relates in his Chaitanya Charitamrita that, once his brother argued with a prominent Vaishnava devotee Minaketana Ramadasa over the ontological positions of Chaitanya and Nityananda (Chaitanya‚Äôs lifelong companion) and belittled the position of Nityananda. Krishna Dasa considered this to be an unpardonable offence and rejected his brother forthwith. After receiving instructions in a vision from Nityananda, Krishna Dasa left Bengal and travelled to Vrindavana where he took initiation from Raghunatha Dasa Goswami (1494‚Äì1586 CE), one of the direct followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Chaitanya Charitamrita At an advanced age and in poor health Krishna Dasa commenced work on his magnum-opus the Chaitanya Charitamrita (c. 1557) after being repeatedly petitioned by the devotees in Vrindavana who had never met Chaitanya and who were eager for details. He vividly describes in the text itself: ‚ÄúI have now become too old and disturbed by invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. I cannot remember anything, nor can I see or hear properly. Still I write, and this is a great wonder.‚Äù In composing his Charitamrita, Krishna Dasa used the diaries of Murari Gupta and Swarupa Damodara, both of whom were intimate associates of Chaitanya. Krishna Dasa was given a great deal of information by his guru, Raghunatha Dasa also, who had served Swarupa Damodara when the latter was Chaitanya's personal secretary. Due to its amount of detail on the life of Chaitanya and his precepts, the Chaitanya- charitamrita became the definitive biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. According to the Gaura-ganoddesha-dipika of Kavi Karnapura, Krishna Dasa Kaviraja has been identified as being an incarnation of the handmaiden of Krishna called Kasturi Manjari. Krishna Dasa Kaviraja's Literary Achievements Krishna Dasa Kaviraja wrote some short prayers in Sanskrit as well as two other major works in addition to the Chaitanya Charitamrita: =1) Chaitanya Charitamrita= The most definitive biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu =2) Sri Govinda-lilamrita= Govinda-lilamrita is a work explaining the daily pastimes of Krishna and his associates in Vrindavana. =3) Saranga-rangada kangada tika= This is a commentary on the Krishna- karnamrita of Bilvamangala Thakura.

United States, 238 F.2d 266 (D.C. Cir. 1956) was a seminal ruling in United States telecommunications decided by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Hush-A-Phone Corporation marketed a small, cup-like device which mounted on the speaking party's microphone, reducing the risk of conversations being overheard and increasing sound fidelity for the listening party. At the time, AT&T; had a near-monopoly on America's phone system, even controlling the equipment attached to its network. In this era, Americans had to lease equipment from Ma Bell or use approved devices. Hush-A-Phone had been around for 20 years without any issues. However, when an AT&T; lawyer saw one in a store window, the company decided to sue on the grounds anything attached to a phone could damage its network. AT&T;, citing the Communications Act of 1934, which stated in part that the company had the right to make changes and dictate \\"the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges,\\" claimed the right to \\"forbid attachment to the telephone of any device 'not furnished by the telephone company.'\\" Initially, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled in AT&T;'s favor. It found that the device was a \\"foreign attachment\\" subject to AT&T; control and that unrestricted use of the device could, in the commission's opinion, result in a general deterioration of the quality of telephone service\\"Phone Company Upheld in Ban on Hush-A-Phone,\\" The New York Times, February 17, 1951, p. 29.  Finding  A federal appeals court dismissed AT&T;'s claim. The court's decision stated that AT&T;'s prohibition of the device was not \\"just, fair, and reasonable,\\" as required under the Communications Act of 1934. Per the judgment, the device \\"does not physically impair any of the facilities of the telephone companies,\\" nor did it \\"affect more than the conversation of the user.\\" The court thus exonerated Hush-A-Phone and prohibited further interference by AT&T; toward Hush-A-Phone users. After the ruling, it was still illegal to connect some equipment to the AT&T; network. For example, modems could not electronically connect to the phone system. Instead, Americans had to connect their modems mechanically by attaching a phone receiver to an acoustic coupler via suction cups. Regardless, the victory for Hush-A-Phone was widely considered a watershed moment in the development of a secondary market for terminal equipment and the breakup of the Bell System. This landmark decision, and the related Carterfone decision, were seen as precursors to the entry of MCI Communications, the development of more pervasive telecom competition, and the creation of FCC regulations to let users more freely use America's phone network. These changes were perhaps best seen in 1981 when the Hayes Smartmodem electronically connected home computers to the internet for the first time.

The undersides are a bright green with a thin white line, often reduced to a faint row of dots or even missing altogether. The iridescent green colour of the undersides is a structural colour caused by diffraction and interference of light by microscopic repeating structures forming a diffraction grating in the wing scales.Morris R.B. (1975) Iridescence from diffraction structures in the wing scales of Callophrys rubi, the Green Hairstreak. Journal of Entomology (A) 49, 149-154. The caterpillars are green with yellow markings along the back. Like other members of the family they are rather sluglike. Life cycle and behavior Egg Figure 3 from Karl Eckstein's Die Schmetterlinge Deutschlands depicts the larva, pupa and imago These butterflies can be found at the end of March, with flight time usually lasting until the end of June, but they are sometimes seen in July and early August. They never rest with their wings open, to maintain their green camouflage.Eurobutterflies The males exhibit territorial behavior. The eggs are laid singly. The caterpillars are not known to be tended by ants, unlike some lycid larvae, but the pupae, which are formed at ground level, emit squeaks that attract ants and it is thought that ants will always bury any that are found. Green hairstreaks overwinter as pupae and are univoltine, having one generation of adult butterflies per year. The larva is recorded as feeding on Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinum uliginosum, Betula, Rubus idaeus, Vicia cracca, Trifolium medium, Calluna vulgaris, Frangula, Rhamnus, Ribes, Spiraea, Caragana, Chamaecytisus, Hedysarum, Genista, Trifolium and Hippophae rhamnoides in different parts of its range. This polyphagous species probably has one of the largest range of food plants of any British butterfly. Early butterfly collectors thought that the only food plant was bramble (blackberry) Rubus fruticosus but as its habits became better understood the list grew and will probably continue to do so. Depending on the habitat it will use common rock rose Helianthemum nummularium, bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, gorse Ulex europaeus, broom Cytisus scoparius, Dyer's greenweed Genista tinctoria, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, buckthorn Rhamnus cathartica, cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and bramble. Habitat The wide range of food plants means that this butterfly is able to use a wide range of habitats including chalk downland, heathland, moorland and clearings in woodland. It is present in wetlands as well as on poor dry meadows, at an elevation of about . Distribution Callophrys rubi is found in most of Europe,Fauna europaea North Africa, Russia, Asia Minor, Siberia, Amurland, Baluchistan and Chitral. It is still widespread across most of the UK, although many colonies have been lost in recent years. In Mediterranean countries it is quite localised and it is usually found near the coasts.

The company was later revived as Vector Motors Corporation, and has continued to develop sports cars. When founded, Vector represented America's first attempt to compete with European performance car manufacturers like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Lotus. Altogether around 50 Vector sports car models were developed and produced during the 1980s and 1990s including some racing versions mostly built using American made components. Nearly every car produced by the company is designated the letter \\"W\\" (for Wiegert) and a number. A letter \\"X\\" after the W (e.g. WX-8) signifies a prototype unit. As of August 2018, the company is still actively developing an entirely new vehicle, the WX-8, a vehicle positioned in the colloquially named \\"hypercar\\" category, which it first announced and presented a prototype model of back in 2007.  Origin  In 1971, Gerald Wiegert, who had just graduated from college, founded a design house called Vehicle Design Force and teamed up with Lee Brown, a well-known auto body expert in Hollywood, to create a new car called The Vector. The Vector was planned to feature various powerplant options, including a DOHC Porsche engine, and preproduction literature said that it would cost US$10,000 Aeromotive club (through Internet Archive)(at the time, a new Rolls Royce Silver Shadow cost $11,500). The Vector was featured on the cover of Motor Trend magazine in April 1972, and a concept prototype was displayed at the 1976 LA Auto Show, however the car did not enter production. Lee Brown left the design team in 1977. Wiegert renamed Vehicle Design Force to \\"Vector Aeromotive\\" after the previous vehicle's research was refocused on a new car, the Vector W2. = The Vector W2 = Vector W2 The W2 concept appeared in 1978. Like the first car, it was immobile at the time of its show debut, but in 1979, a running prototype was constructed. The vehicle traveled over , the most of any concept vehicle. The W2 was extensively covered by many magazines, and it was thoroughly tested by Motor Trend magazine and the British automotive television program Top Gear. However, Top Gear was ordered not to perform a top speed test on it, even though Vector claimed the car was capable of 230 mph. = Vector W8 = 1992 W8 twin-turbo In 1989, Wiegert's company, now known as the Vector Aeromotive Corporation, began production of the W8, an evolution of the W2. Financial backing came from public stock offerings and various lawsuits including suits against the Goodyear Tire Company (trademark infringement with the Vector brand of tires) and Vantage cigarettes. Two W8 prototypes were made, of which only one ran. The Vector W8 utilized an automatic Oldsmobile TM425 Transaxle mated to a Twin-Turbo CAN-AM modified Chevrolet small block V8 engine. One black W8 was pre-ordered by famous tennis player Andre Agassi. Since Vectors were hand built, each required significant time to finish, calibrate and test, but Agassi demanded that the company deliver his W8 before it was ready.Tv.com biography of Gerald WiegertVector, another fantasy flop - Michael Sheehan. Vector complied, and company representatives told him that he could display it, but warned him not to drive it until the final work was completed. Agassi ignored this advice, and when the vehicle broke down, Wiegert and Vector Aeromotive refunded his US$455,000 purchase price; this resulted in negative publicity despite the circumstances. Afterwards, Agassi's W8 was finished and the car was resold. A total of 17 Vector W8 cars were built for public sale. The Vector W8 appeared in the 1993 film Rising Sun, driven by a Japanese businessman. The logotype of the Vector W8, as seen at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2007. = Avtech WX-3 = Wiegert displayed Vector motorcar at the Geneva Auto Show in 1993. The Avtech WX-3 coupe and Avtech WX-3R roadster further evolved the W8 design. Only one prototype of each model was built. Plans called for the WX-3 to carry three different engine options: a \\"basic\\" V-8, an \\"tuned\\" option, and a twin turbo option,Out of the Shadows - Article by Paul Garson from the August 2004 issue of Automobile Magazine. While the Coupe had the twin turbo engine (tuned to about 800 hp) the roadster had the same Chevrolet engine as the W8. When the WX-3 debuted in 1993, MegaTech, an Indonesian company, acquired a controlling interest in Vector. After Wiegert returned from the Geneva show, the Vector board asked Wiegert to relinquish control of the company and assume only the role of the company's designer. He refused, and ordered the Vector headquarters physically locked down. He was later fired from Vector Aeromotive. The WX-3 Coupe was originally painted silver, but it was repainted teal-blue by Wiegert to match the teal-blue and purple logo of his Aquajet jet-ski company. The teal-blue coupe and purple roadster are featured as promotional vehicles on the Aquajet website.  Megatech  = The Vector M12 = Vector M12 ASR racecar Megatech moved Vector from its Wiegert-owned headquarters building in Wilmington, California, to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where the company could share office space with fellow MegaTech-owned automaker Automobili Lamborghini. The new Vector Aeromotive Corporation created a car called the Vector M12, which was loosely based on the WX-3 but powered by a version of the Lamborghini Diablo V12 engine. Consequently, some work on the M12 was handled by Lamborghini. As such, many of the essentially American \\"spirit\\" characteristics of previous editions did not carry over to the M12. Production of the M12 began in 1995 in Florida, and the car was introduced at the 1996 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where Vector displayed two examples. Production was shuttered late in 1996 when the $189,000 cars did not meet projected sales targets. Production resumed after MegaTech sold off Lamborghini (to Audi) and Vector (to management). By early 1999, only 14 M12s were produced. Lamborghini did not fulfill its contracted delivery of motors due primarily to Vector's inability to pay for them. It was alleged that Tommy Suharto, son of Indonesian strongman General Suharto and a MegaTech principal, illegally embezzled from the company for his own personal gain. According to one story, Lamborghini took a W8 for payment for the engines, but since the W8 in question was still Wiegert's property at the time, he took the case to court. He won it back, although Lamborghini, now owned by Volkswagen, has since refused to give the car back. = Vector SRV8 = Vector reduced the cost of the M12 and created the SRV8. This new model went back to its American roots, featuring a modified version of the GM LT1 engine found in the Corvette and a Porsche G50 transaxle. Although, within days of the car's first public appearance, Vector shut its doors. Only one prototype was produced.  Wiegert's return  After the remains of Vector Aeromotive were sold to American Aeromotive, Wiegert took back the assets of Vector and changed the company name from Avtech Motors to Vector Supercars, then finally to Vector Motors. = Vector WX-8 = The Vector WX8 prototype on display at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show Since the company's closure, rumors began to circulate about Wiegert developing a new car to bring Vector back to life with a new model called the WX8. At the Concorso Italiano on August 18, 2006, Wiegert showed up in the V-8 Avtech prototype with friend Keith Rosenberg. He confirmed that he had begun work on another car. Wiegert had the Avtech on display at the Rodeo Drive Concours d'Elegance on June 17, 2007. His business card for Vector Motors Corporation (Wilmington, CA) has him titled as \\"Chairman and CEO.\\" He also announced plans to debut his new prototype at the 2008 LA Auto Show. At the LA Auto Show, Wiegert presented a prototype of the WX8. The car is powered by a supercharged 10-litre all-aluminum V8 with a projected output of , which would make it more powerful than the Bugatti Veyron and the SSC Ultimate Aero TT. Vector claims that the WX8 has a top speed of and a 0-60 time of just under three seconds.
