He was a prominent leader of the left-wing in northern Sri Lanka. He served as the secretary of the Jaffna District Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon. Ponnambalam was noted for his 'clean image' as a political leader. Early life and family Sinnappu Vallipuram Ponnambalam was born on 18 December 1930. He was son of Vallipuram and Ponnammah from Alaveddy in northern Ceylon. He was educated at Arunothaya School and Skanda Varothaya College, Kandarodai. Ponnambalam did his undergraduate and graduate studies at the Madras Christian College in India. He had gotten admitted at the college through the recommendation of S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the Federal Party and Member of Parliament. At the time Ponnambalam was a sympathiser of the Federal Party and helped Chelvanayakam in his election campaign. At the college Ponnambalam came into contact with communists and carried out social work with them. He became a Marxist. Ponnambalam married Pooranam, daughter of Kanapathipillai from Karainagar, in 1956. They had two sons ‚Äì Mavalirajan and Namunakulan. After Pooranam's death in 1974 Ponnambalam married Puvaneswari, daughter of Nagarethinam. They had a daughter, Senchudar. Teaching career Ponnambalam became a teacher at Skanda Varothaya College in 1951. He was later principal of Vidyananda College, Mulliyawalai and a lecturer at Palaly Training College. Political career On his return to Ceylon from India in 1950, Ponnambalam joined the Communist Party. He became an active member of the party, attending conferences in the Soviet Union and China. He was elected to Mallakam Village Committee in 1952. Ponnambalam contested the Kankesanthurai Electoral District seat on a Communist Party ticket in the 1956 parliamentary election. He finished in third place, with 4,313 votes (15.77% of the votes in the constituency). The election was won by S. J. V. Chelvanayakam. He stood as the Communist Party candidate in the Uduvil Electoral District in the March 1960 parliamentary election. He finished in third place, with 3,541 votes (17.27%). The winning candidate, V. Dharmalingam, was a close friend of V. Ponnambalam. In 1962 Ponnambalam became chairman of Mallakam-Alaveddy Village Committee. He was elected district secretary for the Communist Party in 1963. Ponnambalam again contested the Kankesanthurai seat in the 1970 parliamentary election, challenging the Tamil political leader S. J. V. Chelvanayakam once again. Ponnambalam enjoyed strong support from depressed classes and radical youth in the area. In his campaign he accused the Federal Party of resisting progressive measures, such as school, bus service and petroleum distribution nationalisation as well as the enactment of the Paddy Lands Act. He finished in second place with 8,164 votes (26.75%). Build-up of tension In the process of preparing the new 1972 Constitution the Jaffna District Committee of the Communist Party argued that the 1957 Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact be incorporated in the new Constitution. They requested the Communist Party leader Pieter Keuneman to facilitate a meeting with the Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the Minister of Constitutional Affairs Colvin R. de Silva. Ponnabalam headed the Jaffna District Communist Party delegation at the meeting. He argued that with the implementation of the 1957 pact the emergence of a large-scale Tamil insurgency could be avoided. According to Ponnabalam's account Bandaranaike was initially sympathetic to the proposal but was swayed by de Silva to reject it. On 5 October 1974, the Tamil New Tigers ignited dynamite in the residence of Ponnambalam. The attack happened at the same time as Ponnambalam was acting as interpreter for the Prime Minister at a public meeting in Chunnakam. 1975 by-election On 6 February 1975 a bye-election was held for the Kankesanthurai seat (Chelvanayakam had resigned from the seat two years before). Again Chelvanayakam and Ponnambalam confronted each other. Ponnambalam was the candidate of the governing United Front coalition. He lost to Chelvanayakam, who increased his victory margin. Chelvanayakam obtained 25,927 votes and V. Ponnambalam obtained 9,457 votes. The election campaign was marred with tension, and the government assigned a bodyguard for Ponnambalam for his protection. Departure from the Communist Party Dissatisfied with developments inside the Communist Party in regards to the Tamil question, Ponnambalam left the party in 1976. In reaction to Ponnambalam's departure from the party, it was stated that \\"with him went the last bastion of the Left movement in the North.\\" Ponnambalam subsequently founded a new movement, Senthamizhar Iyakkam ('Red Tamil Movement'), a group which would align itself with the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), the main Tamil political party. In 1978 he published the booklet Senthamizhar Aagividuvom ('Let's become Red Tamils'), a manifest detailing his shift towards Tamil nationalism. Ponnambalam borrowed heavily from Lenin's positions on the national question. With the Red Tamil Movement Ponnambalam sought to align with TULF and its leader A. Amirthalingam and move it towards socialist positions. Amirthalingam's candidature in the Kankesanthurai seat at the 1977 parliamentary election was proposed by Ponnambalam. Later years However Ponnabalam's new party failed to make any significant impact. Ponnambalam withdrew from political life and in 1978 shifted his residence to Lusaka, Zambia where he taught at the Co-operative College. He returned to Sri Lanka in the early 1980s, and was active in the Tamil nationalist camp. Ponnambalam migrated to Canada in 1985. He died on 5 March 1994 in Toronto.

The Commissioners' work paved the way for the establishment of the Public Record Office in 1838. The Commissioners were also responsible for publishing various historical records, including the Statutes of the Realm (i.e. of England and Great Britain) to 1714 and the Acts of Parliament of Scotland to 1707, as well as a number of important medieval records. Although the six Commissions were technically distinct from one another, there was a considerable degree of continuity between them, and it is common practice to regard them as a single entity and to refer to them in singular form as the Record Commission. Activities Patent Roll for 3 John (1201‚Äì2), as published by the Record Commission in 1835 using record type The first Commission was established on 19 July 1800, on the recommendation of a Select committee appointed earlier in the year, on the initiative and under the chairmanship of Charles Abbot, MP for Helston, \\"to inquire into the State of the Public Records of this kingdom\\".Walne 1973, pp. 9‚Äì12. The public records were at this time housed in a variety of repositories, including the Tower of London, the chapter house of Westminster Abbey, the Pell Office adjacent to Westminster Hall, Somerset House, and elsewhere, often in a disorganised state and in highly unsuitable physical conditions. The idea of a single central repository was mooted as early as 1800, and became the subject of an abortive parliamentary bill in 1833, but it was to be some years before this was achieved: in the meantime, the Commissioners arranged for various moves of individual classes of records into new accommodation. These moves were well-intentioned and sometimes led to improvements in storage and arrangement, but more often resulted in the loss and further disorganisation of records.Walne 1973, pp. 13‚Äì14.Cantwell 1984, p. 278. The Commission (in particular the sixth Commission, which sat from 1831 to 1837) gained a reputation for inactivity, corruption, jobbery, and for including among its members too many persons in high office with other demands on their time. Some of these criticisms came from external observers, such as Sir Harris Nicolas; others were made by the Commission's own salaried employees, notably Henry Cole, and to a lesser extent Thomas Duffus Hardy.Cantwell 1984, p. 277‚Äì8. A Parliamentary committee, appointed to inquire into its work, reported in 1836 that the national archives remained scattered in a number of unsuitable locations, and in the custody of \\"a multitude of imperfectly responsible keepers\\".Cantwell 1984, p. 277. Out of these controversies emerged the Public Record Office Act 1838, which established the Public Record Office in that same year.Cantwell 1984. The Commissioners' second objective was to make the records more accessible through the compilation of finding aids (indexes and calendars), and where possible the publication of these, as well as the publication of full texts of selected records of particular importance. The sixth Commission employed four sub- Commissioners (Joseph Hunter, Francis Palgrave, Joseph Stevenson, and for a time John Caley), as well as other ad hoc editors and a number of clerks, specifically on the task of editing records for publication.Walne 1973, p. 15. Most of the Commission's publications used a \\"record type\\" typeface, designed to present the text in a near-facsimile of the manuscript originals. The publications programme was generally considered a success, and many of the Commission's editions remain in current scholarly use. In other cases, however, the absence of a permanent arrangement to the records rapidly rendered the compilation of finding aids redundant.Walne 1973, pp. 14‚Äì17.

Today, because of reuse over the centuries, it is part of a mass of construction which appears to be a Medieval structure at first sight. Nevertheless, the core of the structure is datable to the first half of the fourth century. The original marble coating has been completely lost. History What today looks like an austere house was in fact a quadrifrons arch similar in appearance and scale to the so-called Arch of Janus in the Velabrum (actually named the Arch of the Divine Constantine), in Roman times. The arch's current name (House or Arch of Malborghetto) derives from the place where it is located, Malborghetto. It contains a museum and a branch of the Superintendency of Cultural Properties. The arch's vault stood over the crossroads of two important roads, the Via Flaminia and the Via Veientana, interesting remains of which have been brought to light in the area around the monument. The first official notice regarding the building dates to 1256 and is found in a deed of sale of the Orsini family, where it is mentioned as the site of a tiny village protected by a double wall. In the medieval period, perhaps the Eleventh century, the arch was transformed into a Greek-cross church through the closure of the four archways and the construction of an apse on the east side. The paved road running under the vault was diverted. Ceramic model of the Arch of Malborghetto transformed into a church The toponym Malborghetto (literally \\"evil-ville\\" or \\"pain-ville\\") is more recent and is thought to refer to the sudden devastation at the hands of the Orsini in 1485 to drive off the Colonna who had taken possession of it with the permission of the Pope. The building was completely abandoned until the middle of the sixteenth century, when a Milanese aromatarius (herbalist) who had resided at Rome, Constantino Pietrasanta, rented it and completely rebuilt it. The arch's current appearance is largely due to the changes brought about by Pietrasanta. In the following centuries, it was put to use at different times as a tavern, a house, and post office. An important moment for the realisation of the origins of the arch occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century, when the young German archaeologist Fritz T√∂belmann, who had been studying it for five years, came to the conclusion that the arch was built before the end of the fourth century. T√∂belmann came to this position thanks to a detailed inspection of the construction, in the course of which he discovered a brick stamp from the era of Diocletian (r.284-305) under the plaster on one of the bricks of the arch's central vault. This allowed him to demonstrate that the date of the monument's construction could not be earlier than this period. Diocletianic brick stamp T√∂belmann died in the First World War, leaving behind interesting insights for deeper study by future scholars. In fact, T√∂belmann's description of the appearance that the monument must have originally taken is accurate in many respects, but he is most important for his first-hand observations. He was the first to suggest that the monument had been erected in the place where the troops of Constantine I had camped before the attack on Maxentius, because if he had wanted to commemorate the victory, he would have placed a monument at the location of the battle's beginning (i.e. Saxa Rubra) or at the location of its successful conclusion (i.e. the Milvian Bridge). It remains curious, however, since it is unusual to commemorate the location of the castra aestiva (the \\"summer camp\\", i.e. the campaign camp), which has led scholars to suppose that the monument could have been intended to commemorate the legendary vision that Constantine is reported to have had the day before his battle with Maxentius. More recent studies by Gaetano Messineo have substantially confirmed the deductions of T√∂belmann. Architecture Sangallo The structure of the original construction was that of a quadrifrons with a rectangular floorplan (14.86 x 11.87 metres) at an imposing scale (it is believed to have been around 18 metres high) and on the same plan as the so-called Arch of Janus as can be seen from the travertine pedestals of the four pylons. The brick masonry of the structure is visible. It is assumed that a coating of marble plates was attached by means of metal links; four holes for these links are still visible on the external walls. It is believed that there were columns on two of the four sides, surmounted by an imposing entablature. The attic supported a small roof and was divided on the inside by two walls which created three rooms linked by arched doors. The via Flaminia passed under the building from north to south and the via Veientana from west to east. Some remains of the paving are still present inside the house and in the arch's external perimeter. The architect Giuliano da Sangallo, one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, is responsible for the first sketched reconstruction of the monument's original appearance.Codice Vaticano Barberiniano Latino 4424, carta 36v Later, Fritze T√∂belmann also produced a sketch reconstruction and recent studies have enabled the production of a new model using 3D technology. 3D reconstruction of the Arch of Malborghetto by Prof. Alberto and Marco Carpiceci  See also  *Constantine I *In hoc signo vinces *Battle of the Milvian Bridge ReferencesBibliography *Fritz Toebelmann, Der Bogen von Malborghetto, Carl Winter, Heidelberg 1915. *Carmelo Calci and Gaetano Messineo, Malborghetto, lavori e studi di archeologia pubblicati dalla Soprintendenza archeologica di Roma, De Luca Edizioni d'Arte, Roma 1989. *Gaetano Messineo, La via Flaminia, Roma 1991. *Alberto Carpiceci and Marco Carpiceci, Come Costantin chiese Silvestro d'entro Siratti - Costantino il grande, San Silvestro e la nascita delle prime grandi basiliche cristiane, Edizioni Kappa, Roma 2006.

He began his academic career in 1971 at the University Institutes of Technology of the University of Lorraine as an assistant and then as a lecturer in economics. His economics PhD thesis relates to the building up of the French social security system between 1920 and 1980. He challenges the interpretation that makes the 1945 Social Security a necessary element of the Fordist era of capitalism. He insists instead on the \\"anti- capitalist nature of the institutions of socialization of wages\\". He leads the European Institute of Wages and a popular education association called R√©seau Salariat, which promotes the idea of an \\"unconditional lifelong salary\\" (Salaire √† vie inconditionnel) as an alternative proposal to the basic income \\\\- an idea denounced by Friot as \\"the spare wheel of capitalism\\". His research focuses on the sociology of wages and comparing social protection systems in Europe. His work has also focused on pensions, going against the French government's proposed reforms in 2010. The living wage supported by Bernard Friot is, according to his analyse, the best subversive answer to the four main institutions of capitalism : lucrative property (not private property, only private property where profit is taken from), credit (a state does not need to borrow to finance investment), employment market (the central base of capitalism causing the blackmail to unemployment), the assessing of economic value according to the duration of working. To be fully understood, Bernard Friot developed through Reseau-salariat many tutoring videos. His goal is to show the \\"dej√†-l√†\\", meaning the actual waging by socialized value in the French economic system via the social security, the public employment, etc.  Bibliography  * The Wage under Attack: Employment Policies in Europe (with Bernadette Clasquin), 2013, PIE-Peter Lang *Puissances du salariat, new expanded edition, 2012, ed.

History Howe was born in Forfar, Forfarshire, Scotland, the son of James H. Howe and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Inverwick. and emigrated to South Australia at around age 17, and before age 18 was admitted to the mounted police force, a job which took him all over the colony, and introduced him to such explorers as John McDouall Stuart. He retired from the police force to go into business in Gawler, where he was associated with leading industrialist James Martin. In 1876 he took up farming at Mambray Park, and helped set up a Farmers' Association. Howe entered politics when a couple of vacancies arose in the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Stanley following the death of G. S. Kingston and the resignation of Charles Mann. Howe stood for the seat in conjunction with Alfred Catt; both were elected. He represented Stanley from 27 April 1881 to 1 April 1884; and Gladstone from 2 April 1884 to 24 April 1896. Howe was Commissioner of Public Works in the Downer Ministry from June 1885 to June 1887. He was also Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration in this period, when animosity between him and Professor Custance of Roseworthy Agricultural College resulted in the latter's summary dismissal. He resumed the Crown Lands and Immigration portfolio in the Cockburn cabinet from June 1889 until May 1890, when he succeeded Thomas Burgoyne as Minister of Lands, holding that office till July 1890, when he resigned. Howe was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council for Northern District on 22 May 1897 and held that seat until 5 April 1918. He was a member of the Caledonian Society of South Australia, and its Chief 1886‚Äì1887. He was an old friend of John Moule. He was particularly remembered for his work in establishing the School of Mines, and his life-long support of that institution. A son, Alexander Maxwell Howe (1878 ‚Äì 14 August 1934), was one of its earliest graduates and went on to have a successful career in mining and metallurgy. He was a member of the Federal Convention in 1897, and is credited with making the age pension a Commonwealth responsibility. Howe died at his home of 30 years, \\"Mambray\\", Fifth Avenue, St. Peters, Adelaide on 5 February 1920; his wife Harriette, n√©e Keynes, died there on 27 March 1908.

Castillo de V√©lez-Blanco is a remarcable example of Spanish Renaissance Castle. It is located in the town of V√©lez- Blanco, province of Almer√≠a, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain.  History  It was built by Pedro Fajardo y Chac√≥n after being ranked as I Marquis of Los V√©lez by the Catholic Kings after the Granada War. Works started on 1506 and finished on 1515. It has works by florentian Jacopo Florentino and Mart√≠n Milan√©s, who worked also in the Royal Chapel of Granada. The castle was buit on the foundings of a previous moorish castle set on a hill overlooking the town and only the cistern and some of the castle walls were used for the new castle. Works started in late Gothic style, soon moving to early Renaissance and although its outside resembles a castle it was built as a refined palace in the inside. It¬¥s most remarcable feature is the patio, preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It influenced also the near La Calahorra Castle patio build by Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza, 1st Marquis of Cenete and now both patios are considerered the best examples of eartly Renaissance examples in Spain. Today, it¬¥s Torre del Homenaje keep is an outstanding feature, over high, an emblematic element of the castle and a symbol of the power over the wealthy aristhocrat¬¥s estate. The stone structure, had wooden stairs, which could be removed in case of danger isolating the upper level as a last defense. There is a vast number of decorative elements topping its battlements. In 1764 the Marquis of Los Velez donated a cannon for the Church of Velez Rubio church bells. The property was ever since neglected, during the Peninsular War the rich interior was subject of looting and at during the XIX century the Patio was used to store grain and reed, as found in a document kept in the Medina Sidonia Fundation library. In 1931 it was listed as a Spanish Bien de Inter√©s Cultural monument. The building has been restored in stages during the second half of the 20th century, including the floors of the towers. In the early XX century it¬¥s valuables were sold by it¬¥s owners mainly to french antique dealers. Since 1945 the Spanish Renaissance marble patio and artesonados or Spanish ceilings are held by the Metropolitan Museum of New York after being bequested by Ôøºbanker George Blumenthal to the museum. In 2019 the Spanish National Research Council found that one of Blumenthal's Spanish Ceilings is now owned by the country of M√©xico and is in the Instituto Cultural Hel√©nico of M√©xico City.

It is dated to around 660 BC. The Horse Amphora is the oldest known Melian Amphora and is among the largest examples of the type. The amphora is 88 centimetres high, the lid is not preserved. The name of the vessel derives from its main image, which shows two slim, graceful, long- legged horses standing beside each other. The two are separated by a Palmette. While their bodies are shown as silhouettes, the heads are depicted in outline. The empty space was filled with various motifs, including zigzags which recall earlier images of Group Ad, though the drawings are far more detailed than those of the Ad Group. Along with the zigzags, there are also double-volutes and leaf-rosettes. Out-turned double-volutes are found on the neck which are filled with cross-hatching. The two ornamental bands of the vessel's body are decorated with simpler double-volutes and concentric circles. The horizontal double handles are reminiscent of goats' horns (or, really, anything curved...). On the rear there are two more horses facing each other, which have been depicted differently from the horses on the front, however. Both sides were decorated therefore, but the rear has mostly flaked off. The horse motif fits with nigward its use as a grave vase, since the horse had sepulchral symbolism.

It is based on the 1892 short story of the same name written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Synopsis  The film is an ‚ÄúOrigins Myth\\" rather than a direct adaptation of the famous Charlotte Perkins Gilman story. Drawing from the original short story and a number of Gilman's other gothic works (The Giant Wisteria, The Unwatched Door, etc.). Also, the film is an original narrative of events that unfold around the actual writing of ‚ÄúThe Yellow Wallpaper‚Äù short story. The film's plot is greatly expanded from the bare bones of Gilman's often-anthologized short story. It stars Juliet Landau as Charlotte and Aric Cushing (as her husband John), Golden Globe winner Michael Moriarty as Mr. Hendricks, Veronica Cartwright, Raymond J. Barry, and Independent Spirit Award winner Dale Dickey. The story surrounds Charlotte and John, who retreat to a countryside house in an attempt to start their life over after a devastating fire takes the life of their daughter. Soon the spirit of the deceased Sarah and other spirits are haunting the place. There are feral dogs, an interaction with a dead man in armor, and a shout out to classic, early genre vampire fiction. Production  Most of the scenes in The Yellow Wallpaper were shot in Eatonton, Georgia, in and around an isolated Civil War-era house. The farmhouse's location is undisclosed, meant to represent, as the director puts it, ' a space outside of space'. Jessi Case recalled being a little frightened of the house where the film was shot. 'The stairs leading to the attic, where we filmed a lot of the scenes, were very narrow and it was very hot. They didn't want me to go outside because my hair would poof up'. Michael Moriarty said of the film: The Yellow Wallpaper is going to be a wonderfully haunting film, profoundly Gothic. It's a low budget production, but exceptionally well written.\\" After the shooting of the film, Michael Moriarty retired from acting, after an illustrious career in which he won a Tony award, numerous Emmy awards, and a Golden Globe award. It was his last feature film role. The script was written in three months by Logan Thomas and Aric Cushing, and Cushing said his goal was to popularize Gilman's work. Director Thomas used the Digital Sony 950, and the film is the first ever period feature film to be shot with this digital format. Thomas is becoming known as a \\"visualist\\" director in the tradition of David Lynch and Ridley Scott. Juliet Landau, during an interview, compared her role to Nicole Kidman's role in \\"The Others\\". Kyla Kennedy's first role at the age of 3, before going on to work on shows such as The Walking Dead and Speechless. The film is a seminal role for actor Aric Cushing and the last film role of actor Ted Manson, who also appeared in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Brad Pitt. A companion book to the film was written, The Yellow Wallpaper and Other Gothic Stories, by Aric Cushing. The book features two stories previously unpublished since their inception, and seemingly lost. The essay in the beginning of the book was written by Cushing entitled \\"Is the Yellow Wallpaper a Gothic Story?\\"  Release  By the time the film was released, Blockbuster Video was beginning to have problems and mass-shut downs of their video stores. The film was picked up by Netflix, iTunes, and various distribution outlets in the United States and subsequently released on Amazon. Aric Cushing said of the release of the film: In the 1990s the trend in acquisition, as well as public consumption, was independent films. You could write, produce, and distribute a movie and make money. Redbox and Amazon has now killed that almost completely. Upon the film's release, reviewers were polarized with such statements as \\"'Even as straight horror without any implications of living up to an established narrative, ‚ÄúWallpaper‚Äù plays against some traditional horror conventions ‚Äì and not in a good way.'\\" and \\"the film is atmospheric but feels at times that it is too languid in its approach.\\" While other reviews commented, \\"'Luckily, the cliches are kept to a minimum, and as it turns out it's actually a rather unique take on the material, deftly blending psychological terror into the mix in a manner not unlike The Shining.'\\" and \\"The idea of male dominance and male-dominated culture is a favorite issue of Gilman‚Äôs, as well as the idea of there being no escape. That issue runs through most of her works, and ‚ÄúThe Yellow Wallpaper‚Äù is no different. The movie version may be tamer, but the underlying theme is indeed still there. And while there are definitely similarities and differences between the two, when it comes down to it, in the end both women end up becoming the woman behind the wallpaper.\\" Cushing commented in the introduction to his book Lost Essays, the film was both loved and loathed. The director Logan Thomas's comments on the film after the release were, \\"we never thought of it as a horror movie, more of a gothic mind bender\\" and, commenting on his new feature film There's No Such Thing as Vampires, \\"I certainly didn't want to do another slow-burn movie that was a head puzzle like The Yellow Wallpaper\\".

Biography Tanabe was born in what is now K≈çsh≈´, Yamanashi as the younger son of a local sake brewer. He graduated from the law school of Tokyo Imperial University in 1905 and received a posting to the Ministry of Communications. He was subsequently sent to France for studies, and returned as an expert in wireless communications. Tanabe rose through the ranks within the ministry, becoming Bureau Chief in 1924. Tanabe was drawn into politics over the debate for constitutional revision at the time of the Kiyoura administration, and denounced the privileged position of the bureaucracy. He resigned from his post at the time of the Kat≈ç administration. However, conservative Minister of Justice and President of the House of Peers, Kiichir≈ç Hiranuma thought very highly of Tanabe, and invited him to accept a position on the board of his Kokuhonsha, a nationalist political group founded in 1924. Tanabe became Hiranuma‚Äôs prot√©g√© and assistant. In 1927, he was appointed Governor of Osaka by Home Minister Suzuki Kisabur≈ç, another Hiranuma prot√©g√© and Kokuhonsha member. However, he was forced to resign after a year when Suzuki was indicted on suspicion of electoral irregularities. In 1933, Tanabe relocated to Manchukuo, where he served as vice-chairman to the Privy Council of the Empire of Manchukuo. He supported the viewpoint of the Kwangtung Army that private management of industries was more realistic than a completely state-controlled economy. He was recalled to Japan with the formation of the Hiranuma administration, and after serving for a brief period as Chief Cabinet Secretary from January to April 1939, he was appointed Minister of Communications, serving in that post from April through the end of August 1939. In 1938, Tanabe was appointed to a seat in the Upper House of the Diet of Japan. In 1941, he succeeded his mentor Hiranuma in the post of Home Minister in the 3rd Konoe administration for a period of three months. After World War II, Tanabe was purged by the American occupation authorities. He died of illness in 1950. References * Hall, John Whitney. The Cambridge History of Modern Japan.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Easton. In 1980 it was included as a contributing property in the Easton Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Rt. Rev. Henry Champlin Lay, the first Bishop of Easton, desired a cathedral for his young diocese. The original plans called for a complex of buildings that included a church, diocesan offices, a library, and a Bishop's residence. The buildings were designed to be grouped around a courtyard similar to a traditional English cathedral. Construction on the church was begun in 1891. The granite for the exterior was said to have been shipped by water from Port Deposit, Maryland. While not completed, the first services were held the following year. Except for the spire, the church building was completed in 1894. It was consecrated on May 25 of that year and was put into service as the diocesan cathedral. The stained glass windows date from 1891 to 1979 and reflect the different styles over that time period. The spire on the tower was completed in 1978. The bell that hangs in the tower was cast in the Philippines. It originally hung in the Chapel of the Epiphany in Preston, Maryland. See also *George A.

Originating from a monsoon trough, Typhoon Thad was first classified on August 15, 1981 and was upgraded into a tropical storm the next day. Meanwhile, Thad moved north and northeast and attained typhoon intensity midday on August 18\\\\. The next day, the storm reached its peak intensity of . On August 22, Thad accelerated northward, striking eastern Japan the next day just before weakening to a tropical storm. After passing through the country, the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 23\\\\. Forty-one persons perished in Japan due to the typhoon and 173 others were hurt. Thad flooded 31,082 houses and demolished 4,401 others. Roughly 27,000 people were left homeless because of Thad. Moreover, 111,500 homeowners were without power during the height of the storm. Furthermore, the storm also destroyed 449 roads, and was responsible for 499 landslides. The cyclone inundated of farm land. Train service was interrupted in 22 lines. Meteorological history Typhoon Thad originated from an active monsoon trough several hundred miles east of the Philippines in mid-August 1981\\\\. On August 10, a weak surface circulation was first noted on satellite imagery. At that time, the center was embedded within the monsoon trough. Within five days, the system developed outflow. Midday on August 15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system. Based on data from Hurricane Hunters, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 1800 UTC on August 15\\\\. Situated south of a subtropical ridge, the cyclone was located within a favorable environment for further development. Early on August 16, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm. Following an increase in organization, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Depression 15 that day. Initially, the depression was expected by the JTWC to move north before accelerating towards the northwest. On August 17, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. At this time, the agency anticipated Thad to re-curve well east of Japan. By 0000 UTC on August 18, the JTWC upgraded Thad to typhoon status as the cyclone developed a ragged eye. Six hours later, the JMA followed suit. During the evening of August 18, the agency estimated that Thad reached its peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early the next day, the JTWC estimated peak winds of . According to the JMA, Thad would maintain its peak wind speed until August 21, when the storm weakened slightly. However, the JTWC suggested that Thad began to deteriorate on August 20\\\\. The next day, forecasts from the JTWC indicated that the typhoon was expected to re-curve and accelerate due to a trough located south of Japan. However, since the trough moved into the Sea of Japan instead, a subtropical ridge developed east of Typhoon Thad. On August 22, however, Thad accelerated northward in the general direction of Japan. At 0000 UTC on August 23, the JTWC downgraded Thad into a tropical storm while moving onshore in central Japan. Several hours later, the JMA followed suit, even though Thad had moved well inland by that time. By this time, cooler air had taken toll on the storm, and that afternoon, data from both agencies indicated that Thad finished its transition into an extratropical cyclone. By that time, Thad merged with a trough over the Tatar Strait. However, the JMA continued monitoring the system until the morning of August 25. Preparations and impact While moving across northern Japan, Thad affected 21 of Japan's 47 provinces while becoming the first storm to directly strike Kanto in 16 years. A peak rainfall total of was recorded in Oku-Nikko in Tochigi, including in a day. A peak hourly storm total of was measured at Kamisatomi in Gunma. Thad was responsible for strong winds, including a wind speed at Hidakamombetsu on Hokkaido. In all, 43 people perished and 173 were injured. Damage totalled JP¬•227.2 billion (US$1.03 billion). Overall, the typhoon flooded 31,082 houses and demolished 4,401 dwellings. Furthermore, the storm also blocked roads in 850 spots, destroyed 449 others, collapsed 80 bridges, broke dikes at 173 places, and generated 499 landslides. Approximately 27,000 people were left homeless because of Thad. About 115,000 households were left without electricity. Furthermore, Thad inundated of farm land. Train service was interrupted in 22 lines, including 18 \\"bullet\\" trains. Four flights were also cancelled; however, by August 24, air traffic had returned to normal. Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22 houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged roads in 145 places, and flooded 27 rivers. According to police reports, five individuals drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding from the nearby Ayu River that crushed houses along the bank. In Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person was killed by a falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000 dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000 families were evacuated. Another 4,000 families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August 25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes. In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area. However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm. In all, Thad was considered the worst storm to strike the nation in two years.

It is located about 2,840 light-years (870 parsecs), from Earth in the constellation Draco. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Characteristics=Physical characteristics= Kepler-90h is a gas giant with no solid surface. Its equilibrium temperature is . It is around 1.2 times as massive and around 1.01 times as large as Jupiter. This makes it very similar to Jupiter, in terms of mass and radius. =Orbit= Kepler-90h orbits its host star about every 331.6 days at a distance of 1.01 astronomical units, very similar to Earth's orbital distance from the Sun (which is 1 AU). Habitability Kepler-90h resides in the circumstellar habitable zone of the parent star. The exoplanet, with a radius of 1.01 , is too large to be rocky, and because of this the planet itself may not be habitable. Hypothetically, large enough moons, with a sufficient atmosphere and pressure, may be able to support liquid water and potentially life. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Kepler-90h, this would be practically the same to have a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. To support an Earth- like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from sputtering is for the moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts. NASA's Galileo's measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 . Host star The planet orbits a (G-type) Kepler-90, its host star. The star is 1.2 times as massive as the Sun and is 1.2 times as large as the Sun. It is estimated to be 2 billion years old, with a surface temperature of 6080 K. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14. It is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, which typically can only see objects with a magnitude around 6 or less. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-90; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-90h occurred roughly every 331 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 331-day transits. The discovery, was announced on November 12, 2013.Schmitt, Joseph R.; Wang, Ji; Fischer, Debra A.; Jek, Kian J.; Moriarty, John C.; Boyajian, Tabetha S.; Schwamb, Megan E.; Lintott, Chris; Smith, Arfon M.; Parrish, Michael; Schawinski, Kevin; Lynn, Stuart; Simpson, Robert; Omohundro, Mark; Winarski, Troy; Goodman, Samuel J.; Jebson, Tony; Lacourse, Daryll (2013). \\"Planet The First Kepler Eight Planet Candidate System from the Kepler Archival Data\\", Astrophysical Journal, p. 23.

Background The photo was posted on December 17, 2013 by the organization, which advocated for the legislative agenda of President Barack Obama, from President Obama's own Twitter account. It was part of a general campaign to get younger Americans to sign up for the health insurance program.

Criticism The day after the original tweet, December 18, New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie lampooned and criticized Pajama Boy with his own tweet, which featured a photo of him volunteering in an apron with the accompanying text: \\"Get out of your pajamas. Put on an apron. Get volunteering. #SeasonOfService.\\" Libertarian commentator Nick Gillespie, writing in the Reason magazine blog, wrote that \\"for many ‚Äî arguably most ‚Äî Americans, this guy is hipster douchitude on a cracker.\\" In Bloomberg News, libertarian pundit Megan McArdle said conservatives got \\"trolled\\" by Pajama Boy: \\"The purpose of Pajama Boy is not to get people to buy health insurance, but to get a rise out of conservatives ‚Äî and thereby to engage the solidaristic, money-raising, meme-spreading power of OFA‚Äôs liberal base.\\" Analyzing the perceived issues with the campaign, however, Salon wrote that \\"Organizing for America has a tendency to try to promote Obamacare on Twitter with images that, one imagines, they think will be potentially viral.

It was upgraded several times before being deactivated in 1993. It was reactivated in 1995 and is a tourist attraction for the Whyalla area and an icon of the Point Lowly area.  History  The lighthouse at Point Lowly was constructed in 1883 to guide ships traversing Spencer Gulf, en route to the northern ports of Port Augusta and Port Pirie. The lighthouse and its cottages pre-date the establishment of Whyalla and are the oldest European heritage structures in the Whyalla area. The original tower was 15 metres in height and was made from local sandstone. The optical apparatus had an eight side catadioptric lens which revolved once every 80 seconds and gave a 2-second flash every 10 seconds. Supplies were brought to the lighthouse by boat from Port Pirie on the eastern shore of Spencer Gulf. The structure was raised by 7.6 metres to its current height in 1909. The original mineral-oil fueled wick burner light was replaced by a kerosene vaporising light unit during the upgrade. In 1973 the light was demanned. This followed the installation of a battery-powered Stone Chance Power Beam Beacon on the balcony. In 1979, the lens and lamp were upgraded and the light was connected to mains electricity. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. In 1983, the lighthouse and cottages received heritage listing. In 1993, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority deemed the light to be unnecessary and the light was deactivated. In 1994, the lighthouse and its attendance buildings and of land has been listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register since 11 November 1999. In 1995, the light was reactivated after community appeal and remains under the control of the local government area of the City of Whyalla.Point Lowly Lighthouse Lighthouses of Australia Inc. Accessed 2014-01-01.  Current use  The Point Lowly Lighthouse is a popular icon of the upper Spencer Gulf region. It features in tourism literature, on billboards and was adopted as a logo by the community action group, Save Point Lowly. A reserve which includes the lighthouse, cottages and associated structures has been listed on the South Australian Heritage Places database since 15 December 1994. Its significance is reported as follows: blockquote>The Point Lowly Lightstation is important for its association with the maritime history of South Australia in the 1880s, a time when several lighthouses were built to protect increasing shipping traffic in the Colony's waters. The lighthouse is also associated with the development of Port Pirie, Whyalla and BHP's mining operations in the area. Originally constructed of stone in 1883, the lighthouse was extended in height in 1908. The use of concrete in this extension represents both an early use of concrete and the first use of structural concrete in a lighthouse in South Australia. (HSA: SL 6/99) The lighthouse cottages are available as rental accommodation, sleep up to 29 people and are managed by Whyalla City Council.'VisitorsGuide.com.au They are often used by recreational divers and marine scientists who visit the region's cuttlefish aggregation each winter. Flinders University Underwater Club Between July and September 2014, the Whyalla City Council will be conducting an assessment of the buildings' condition, restoration needs, costs, resource and operating requirements. The council will investigate options to incorporate the cottages into a single business unit for visitation, tourism, education and cultural services and will consider potential outsourcing.

He was one of the most celebrated generals of the period, and he was also the father of three daughters who received empress titles ‚Äî two as successive empresses of the Later Zhou emperor Guo Rong (Empress Fu the Elder and Empress Dowager Fu (Later Zhou)), and one (posthumously) as a wife of Zhao Guangyi, who would become the second emperor of Song.  Background  Li Yanqing was born in 898, near the end of Tang Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. His father, then known as Li Cunshen but who was born with the name of Fu Cun, was an adoptive son of and general under the major late-Tang warlord Li Keyong the Prince of Jin.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 56. Li Yanqing was said to be the fourth-born son of Li Cunshen's, but only the identities of two of his older brothers, Li Yanchao () and Li Yanrao (), were recorded in history; he also had at least two younger brothers, Li Yanneng () and Li Yanlin (). (All four of his known brothers would eventually serve as generals.) When Li Yanqing was 12 ‚Äî i.e., in 910 ‚Äî by which time Tang had fallen and the Jin realm, theoretically still under Tang rule, was actually under the rule of Li Keyong's biological son and successor Li Cunxu ‚Äî Li Yanqing, who was already capable of riding and archery, entered military service under Li Cunxu, being close enough to Li Cunxu that he was allowed to enter the prince's bedchamber. When he grew older, he became an officer in Li Cunxu's army. Also in his youth, he became a friend of Shi Chonggui, the nephew of Shi Jingtang, the son-in-law of Li Siyuan, also an adoptive son of Li Keyong's. (However, while this was traditionally described as such in official accounts, Shi Chonggui, born in 914, was 16 years younger than Li Yanqing.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 81.  During Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu claimed imperial title as the emperor of a new Later Tang, and shortly after conquered his southern rival Later Liang and took over its territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Li Yanqing continued to serve as an officer of Li Cunxu's imperial guards. In 924, Li Yanqing's father Li Cunshen died, while serving as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing).Zizhi Tongian, vol. 273. In 926, many mutinies were occurring against Li Cunxu's rule.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Eventually, a mutiny even rose at the capital Luoyang itself, and it was said that when the mutiny occurred, the officers and soldiers were deserting Li Cunxu in droves, with only some 10-20 officers/soldiers, including Li Yanqing, remaining with Li Cunxu and fighting the mutineers. During the battle, Li Cunxu was hit by a stray arrow, and eventually died from that injury. Upon seeing Li Cunxu's death, Li Yanqing and the others cried and then left the area. The army of Li Siyuan (who had previously rebelled against Li Cunxu) arrived at Luoyang shortly after, and Li Siyuan claimed imperial title. Li Yanqing's older brother Li Yanchao, who was then the defender of the northern capital Taiyuan, submitted to Li Siyuan's rule shortly after; presumably, so did Li Yanqing. In 927, Li Yanchao requested to change his surname to his father's original surname of Fu, and Li Siyuan granted that request; presumably, Li Yanqing and his other brothers also changed their name at that time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 928, when Li Siyuan ordered a general campaign against the rebellious Wang Du, the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Fu Yanqing, who then carried the titles of the commander of the Longwu Corps and prefect of Ji Prefecture (ÂêâÂ∑û, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi) (an honorary title, as Ji Prefecture was then under the rule of Later Tang's southeastern neighbor Wu), served on the campaign against Wang. When the army of the Khitan Empire tried to aid Wang, Fu participated in the great Later Tang victory over Khitan forces at Mount Jia (ÂòâÂ±±, near Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture (), which eventually led to Ding's falling and Wang's suicide. After the campaign, Fu was made the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Yao Prefecture (ËÄÄÂ∑û, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi). He was later made the prefect of Qing Prefecture (ÊÖ∂Â∑û, in modern Qingyang, Gansu) and, at imperial direction, built a fort to try to entice Dangxiang tribesmen to submit to Later Tang. Early in the Qingtai era (934-936) of Li Siyuan's adoptive son and successor Li Congke, Fu was made the prefect of Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Baoding), and put in command of the cavalry soldiers on the borders with the Khitan Empire. There was a time when he went hunting that, within a day, he killed 42 animals ‚Äî deer, pigs, wolves, foxes, and rabbits ‚Äî impressing the people who witnessed the feat. In 936, Shi Jingtang, then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered at Taiyuan), rebelled against Li Congke. He sought aid from Khitan's Emperor Taizong. Li Congke sent an army, commanded by Zhang Jingda, to attack Shi. Fu was one of the generals serving under Zhang. Zhang quickly put Taiyuan under siege. However, when the Liao army, commanded by Emperor Taizong himself, thereafter arrived at Taiyuan, the Liao army attacked and defeated the Later Tang army despite the efforts of Fu and Gao Xingzhou. The Later Tang army was forced to take up defensive position at Jin'an Base (ÊôâÂÆâÂØ®, near Taiyuan), and shortly after became surrounded by the Liao/Hedong army. Several times Fu and Gao tried to fight out of the encirclement, but could not. Eventually, Zhang's deputy Yang Guangyuan assassinated Zhang and surrendered the Later Tang army to the Liao/Hedong army, the control over which Emperor Taizong then transferred to Shi. Thereafter, Emperor Taizong created Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin. Fu became a subject of Later Jin's. Shortly after, with Shi's army approaching Luoyang, Li Congke committed suicide, ending Later Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.  During Later Jin  Early in Shi Jingtang's reign, Fu Yanqing was made the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). In 937, Fu Yanqing's older brother Fu Yanrao, who was then serving as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), got into a conflict with another military governor, Bai Fengjin (), and while they argued, Fu Yanrao's soldiers killed Bai. This assassination was subsequently blamed on Fu Yanrao, and Fu Yanrao was captured and executed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. While Shi then issued an edict stating that Fu Yanrao's brothers would not also be punished, Fu Yanqing nevertheless submitted a resignation, which Shi declined. However, he did recall Fu Yanqing to serve as a general of the imperial guards, but later sent him back out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Baoda Circuit (‰øùÂ§ß, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). In 942, Shi Jingtang died, and Shi Chonggui succeeded him as emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Having been friendly with Fu since their youth, he recalled Fu from Baoda and thereafter made him the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), close to the capital Kaifeng. With Shi Chonggui taking a hostile tone in his relationship with Khitan (which had been renamed Liao), Emperor Taizong made a major invasion into Later Jin territory in 944 to aid Yang Guangyuan, who had rebelled against Shi's rule from his post at Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). Fu was one of the generals whose armies were mobilized to resist the Liao invasion, and there was a time when he, Gao Xingzhou, and Shi Gongba () were surrounded by Liao forces, such that they almost were captured, but Fu fought valiantly; subsequently, when Shi Chonggui himself arrived with a relief force, they were saved.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. When eventually, with Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture () under siege, Yang's son Yang Chengxun () arrested his father and surrendered, Fu was rewarded with the title of Duke of Qi, and was moved to Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan). On a subsequently Khitan invasion in 945, the Later Jin army, then under the command of Du Wei and Li Shouzhen, encountered the Liao army near Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé, in modern Baoding) and became surrounded. Du panicked and was reluctant to engage the Liao army, but at Fu's advocacy, he, Zhang Yanze, Yao Yuanfu (), and Huangfu Yu (), attacked the Liao army fiercely, causing the Liao army to panic and flee. For his accomplishment, Shi, who then moved him to Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), bestowed on him the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, Fu was later falsely accused by Shi's close associates, and when Shi launched a major attack against Liao under the command of Du and Li Shouzhen in 946,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Fu was not ordered to participate ‚Äî only his soldiers were. He was instead given a few thousand weaker soldiers and stayed near Kaifeng. Only when Du and Li Shouzhen subsequently become surrounded by Emperor Taizong at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding), did Shi summon Gao and Fu and tried to have them serve as a line of defense. When Du and Li Shouzhen then surrendered to Liao, however, the way for Liao to attack Kaifeng became clear, and Emperor Taizong had Zhang Yanze, who also surrendered to Liao, head directly to Kaifeng to capture it. Finding the situation hopeless, Shi surrendered, ending Later Jin. Gao and Fu also went to Emperor Taizong's headquarters to surrender. Emperor Taizong rebuked Fu for having defeated him at Yangcheng. Fu responded, \\"I, your subject, at that time only knew that I should serve the Lord of Jin with all my heart. Whether I live or die is up to you.\\" Emperor Taizong laughed and released him.  During the Liao occupation  Emperor Taizong shortly after claimed to be emperor of China as well, and initially, nearly all of the Later Jin realm submitted to him. However, he allowed Liao soldiers to pillage the countryside, and many rebellions against his rule quickly rose. With his having kept the Later Jin military governors at Kaifeng, the rebellions initially went unchecked. When the rebellions became particularly rampant to the east, he allowed Fu Yanqing to return to Wuning and An Shenqi () the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in Jining, Shandong), to return to their circuits. When Fu approached Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture (), though, the rebel leader Li Renshu (), seized him, and tried to use him to get his son Fu Zhaoxu (), whom he had left in charge at Xu, to open the gates. Fu Zhaoxu, however, refused to open the gates. When Li saw this, he apologized to Fu Yanqing and begged forgiveness. After Fu Yanqing swore not to punish him and the others, they released him and lifted the siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Not long after, Emperor Taizong, tired of dealing with Han Chinese rebellions, chose to withdraw back to Liao proper, but died on the way. After a succession struggle, his nephew Yel√º Ruan the Prince of Yongkang took control of the throne (as Emperor Shizong). With Han rebellions overrunning the former Later Jin lands and with his own succession being challenged by his grandmother Empress Dowager Shul√º, Emperor Shizong did not try to retain control of most of the former Later Jin lands, and what he did hold was lost shortly after.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Chief among the Han Chinese resistance was the army led by Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Hedong, who declared himself the emperor of a new Later Han, which would receive recognition from most of the former Later Jin territory.  During Later Han  After Liu Zhiyuan entered Kaifeng, Fu Yanqing went to Kaifeng to pay homage to him as emperor. Liu transferred him to Taining Circuit and gave him the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). In 948, Liu Zhiyuan died and was succeeded by his son Liu Chengyou as emperor. Immediately after Liu Chengyou's succession to the throne, the officials that Liu Zhiyuan entrusted Liu Chengyou to, pursuant to instructions that Liu Zhiyuan left, executed Du Chongwei (i.e., Du Wei ‚Äî he was known as Du Wei during Later Jin to observe naming taboo for Shi Chonggui). In fear, Li Shouzhen, who was friendly with Du and who was then the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), rebelled. The Later Han imperial government sent the chief of staff Guo Wei to attack Li, and Guo, after sieging Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality (), captured it in fall 949. Li Shouzhen and his family committed suicide by fireZizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. ‚Äî but a daughter of Fu's, whom he had given in marriage to Li's son Li Chongxun (), escaped this mass suicide by hiding herself. Guo had her escorted back to Fu's house.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291. In 950, Fu went to Kaifeng to pay homage to Li Chengxun. He was thereafter moved to Pinglu Circuit,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. and given the honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (); he was also created the Duke of Wei. Later in 950, Liu Chengyou, displeased that the officials Liu Zhiyuan entrusted to were continuing to control the governance, making him feel that he was being ignored, had three of them ‚Äî Guo's colleague as chief of staff, Yang Bin; the commanding general of the imperial guards, Shi Hongzhao; and the overseer of the financial agencies, Wang Zhang ‚Äî killed. He also sent secret emissaries to Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei), where Guo Wei was at the time, to kill Guo, but the news leaked, and Guo was able to escape death, although his family members remaining at Kaifeng were killed. Anticipating a reaction from Guo, Liu Chengyou summoned a number of senior generals, including Fu, Gao Xingzhou, Guo Congyi (), Murong Yanchao (Liu Zhiyuan's half- brother), and Xue Huairang () to the capital, apparently hoping that they would support him in a potential operation against Guo Wei. There was no record of how Fu reacted to the summons. Guo Wei quickly advanced south from Yedu to Kaifeng, and when his army encountered the imperial army, the imperial army was crushed. Liu Chengyou was killed in the confusion, and Guo entered the capital. After initially acting as if he was going to support Liu Zhiyuan's adoptive son (and biological nephew) Liu Yun as emperor, Guo seized the throne himself, establishing Later Zhou as its emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  During Later Zhou  After taking the throne, Guo Wei created Fu Yanqing the Prince of Huaiyang. He also awarded the Kaifeng mansion of Liu Chengyou's close associate Liu Zhu (), whom he had executed, to Fu. Further, later that year or shortly after, he had his adoptive son (the biological nephew of his deceased wife Lady Chai), Guo Rong, marry Fu's daughter (Li Chongxun's widow) as wife. In 952, Murong Yanchao, then at Taining, rebelled against Later Zhou. When Guo personally attacked Murong, Fu went to pay homage to him at the imperial camp, offering horses, silk, and food supplies for the imperial army. After Murong was defeated, Fu was moved to Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Guo was initially intending to further move him to Yedu to serve as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered at Yedu), but at that time, there was a Liao incursion, and he did not want to move Tianxiong's military governor Wang Jun, and so that did not happen. It was not until 953, when Wang offended Guo Wei and was forced into retirement that Fu was made the military governor of Tianxiong and the mayor of Daming (Â§ßÂêç, i.e., Yedu); he was also created the Prince of Wei (Ë°õÁéã, a different title than the one he will eventually carry at death). Guo Wei died in 954, and Guo Rong succeeded him as emperor. Shortly after, Liu Zhiyuan's brother Liu Min, who had claimed imperial title and claimed to be the lawful successor to the Later Han throne (but whose state was generally historically referred to separately as Northern Han), tried to take advantage of the Later Zhou imperial succession by attacking south from his capital Taiyuan. Guo Rong personally led the imperial forces against Liu Min, but also ordered a number of other generals, including Fu, to attack Northern Han on the flanks, with the assignment of Fu and his deputy Guo Chong the military governor of Zhenning Circuit (ÈéÆÂØß, headquartered in modern Anyang) to attack toward Taiyuan through Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan). When Guo Rong himself shortly after defeated Liu Min at Gaoping (È´òÂπ≥, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi) and forced Liu to flee back to Taiyuan, Guo commissioned Fu as the overall commander against Northern Han (with Guo Chong still serving as deputy). He initially only intended to have Fu advance to Taiyuan, show the Later Zhou power to inhibit another future Northern Han attack, and then withdraw. However, once the Later Zhou army was in Northern Han territory and enjoying successes, he changed his mind and wanted Fu to destroy Northern Han. Fu thus put Taiyuan under siege, and Guo Rong himself joined the siege shortly after. However, when Liao forces were subsequently launched to aid Northern Han, and Later Zhou forces did not fare well in small scale encounters with the Liao forward troops, Later Zhou lifted the siege and withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292. Despite the failure to capture Taiyuan, Guo still greatly rewarded Fu. After Guo returned to Kaifeng, he bestowed the title of Taifu () on Fu, and created him the Prince of Wei (). Also in 954, Guo Rong created Fu's daughter empress. She died in 956.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 293. In 959, Guo created her younger sister, also a daughter of Fu's, as the new empress. (She thus became known historically as Empress Dowager Fu (Later Zhou), while the older empress became known as Empress Fu the Elder.) Guo himself died shortly after, and was succeeded by his young son Guo Zongxun. (It is not clear from historical accounts whether Guo Zongxun was the son of Empress Fu the Elder's.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. (Another daughter of Fu's ‚Äî his sixth daughter ‚Äî married Zhao Guangyi, the younger brother of the major general Zhao Kuangyin, sometime during Guo Rong's reign; she was younger than Empress Fu the Elder, although it is not clear whether she was older or younger than Empress Dowager Fu (Later Zhou).)History of Song, vol. 242. After Guo Zongxun took the throne, Fu received the title of Taiwei ().  During Song  In 960, Zhao Kuangyin seized power in a coup, ending Later Zhou and starting a new Song Dynasty as its Emperor Taizu. He gave Fu Yanqing the honorary title of Taishi ().Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. Meanwhile, during the years that Fu was at Tianxiong, he left much of the governance to an administrator, Liu Siyu (). Liu was said to be greedy, and was often finding ways to enrich himself with the tax funds he received from the people, with Fu not realizing it. Further, at that time, regional governments were often engaging in the practice of using unfair weights and measures in collecting taxes (when, for example, the people were using grain to pay their taxes), and Tianxiong was said to be one of the circuits that was particularly worst in this regard. Hearing of this, Emperor Taizu sent imperial administrators to Tianxiong to oversee taxation; Emperor Taizu also took the \\"surplus\\" from the past and awarded it to Fu, to make him ashamed.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. It was also said that Fu favored eagles and dogs, such that if his subordinates had committed faults, they would try to placate him by obtaining good eagles and dogs to offer to him, such that no matter how angry he was, he would be calmed. He was also described to not like drinking, and was humble to those who came to see him. In 963, Fu went to Kaifeng to pay homage to the Song emperor. Emperor Taizu held a feast in his honor, and they spent time shooting arrows. He considered keeping Fu at Kaifeng to command the imperial army. The chief of staff Zhao Pu opposed, arguing that Fu had such great reputation that he might pose a risk as commander. When Emperor Taizu responded, \\"Why do you, sir, suspect Fu Yanqing? We have treated Fu Yanqing so well; how could Fu Yanqing turn against us?\\" Zhao Pu responded, \\"How could Your Imperial Majesty turn against Emperor Shizong of Zhou [(i.e., Guo Rong)]?\\" Emperor Taizu fell silent, and did not give the command to Fu; Fu subsequently returned to Tianxiong. As Fu's governance of the circuit was believed to be lacking, Emperor Taizu subsequently commissioned several lower level imperial officials known for their talent to serve as county magistrates in Fu's realm.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 3. In 969, again believing Fu to be ineffective as a governor, Emperor Taizu moved him to Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). When Fu reached Luoyang, he claimed to be ill and asked to be allowed to remain there until recovery. Emperor Taizu initially agreed, but Fu remained there for 100 days without any signs of getting ready to depart for Fengxiang. The imperial censors indicted him for dereliction of duty, but Emperor Taizu, citing the marital relationship between his family and Fu's, did not punish Fu, but relieved him of the Fengxiang command.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 6. Fu thereafter settled at Luoyang. It was said that he was accustomed to ride ponies in the spring to sightsee at the temples and gardens at Luoyang, enjoying retirement. Fu died in 975. He was given posthumous honors, and his funeral expenses were paid for by the imperial treasury.

He was also the father-in-law of Field Marshal Gen Sugiyama. Life and military career Ogawa was born to a samurai family; his father was a retainer to the daimy≈ç of Kokura Domain, in what is now Kitakyushu, Fukuoka. He studied rangaku under Egawa Hidetatsu and fought as a Kokura samurai against the forces of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain during the Bakumatsu period.

His father, Phillip Ignatius Barziza (originally Filippo Ignazio Barziza), was a viscount who had emigrated from Venice in 1820 and been forced to cede his title of nobility and become an American citizen in order to legally qualify for a bequest; he subsequently married a French-Canadian woman, with whom he had ten children.Decimus et Ultimus Barziza, by R.

He then moved to Texas and later in 1857 enrolled in the law school at Baylor University. He graduated in 1859 and established his law practice in Owensville.BARZIZA, DECIMUS ET ULTIMUS at the Texas State Historical Association; by Jeffrey William Hunt; retrieved December 31, 2013 In 1861, the American Civil War began, and Barziza enlisted in the Confederate Army (4th Texas Infantry), where he served under Louis Wigfall and John Bell Hood.Sons of Garibaldi in Blue and Gray: Italians in the American Civil War, by Frank W. Alduino and David J. Coles; published 2007 by Cambria Press He was twice injured in combat, and fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, where he was captured at Little Round Top. After spending a year in hospital as a prisoner of war, he escaped by leaping out the window of a moving prisoner-transport train in the middle of the night, and walking to Upper Canada, where Confederate sympathizers relayed him to Nova Scotia, and then Bermuda; there, a blockade runner returned him to North Carolina. From North Carolina, he was able to return to Texas, where he wrote his memoirs of captivity and of life as a fugitive, titled The Adventures of a Prisoner of War, and Life and Scenes in Federal Prisons: Johnson's Island, Fort Delaware, and Point Lookout, by an Escaped Prisoner of Hood's Texas Brigade.  Political career  Barziza represented Harris County during the Fourteenth Texas Legislature (1874‚Äì1875) and the first session of the Fifteenth Texas Legislature (1876). During the fourteenth legislature, he played a key role in the controversial transition of the Governorship from Edmund J. Davis to Richard Coke. During the fifteenth legislature, he ran for Speaker of the House, but lost by two votes. At the end of the session, Barziza became embroiled in a procedural dispute regarding the Texas and Pacific Railway: in an effort to prevent a vote, he and 33 other representatives did not return from recess on July 31, 1876, so that there would not be a quorum. In response, the speaker ordered that the absentee representatives be arrested and forcibly brought back to the legislature. On August 2, 1876, Barziza resigned.  Legacy  Barziza Street, in the Houston neighborhood of Eastwood, is named for him. In 1964, the University of Texas Press re-published his memoirs.

Justin Hunte of HipHopDX said, \\"From mic to plug, Beach House EP triumphantly strikes the same note. The Los Angeles-native is a talented songwriter even while essentially re-writing the same song, which is a complicated square to dance in without two-stepping too close to redundancy. Remaining interesting without contextual diversity is tricky. Fortunately, Ty Dolla $ign doesn't have those problems.\\" Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media commented saying, \\"Beach House the EP succeeds where the mixtape Beach House 2 didn‚Äôt, further commercializing Ty‚Äôs sound without sacrificing the meat and potatoes of it, the foul-mouthed, sex-positivity of Ty‚Äôs quixotic bedroom capers and the production‚Äôs precarious balance between slight, house-informed ratchet music, trap and densely arranged traditional R&B; sounds.\\" Christopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone said, \\"Ty Dolla $ign's singsong rap&B; has maintained a perfect balance of comforting croon and pickup-artist kink. This solid seven-song EP, his first official release, doesn't sail out too far from the formula of Ty's Beach House mixtapes.\\" David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, \\"Ty Dolla $ign comes off as a hip-hop and street-level alternative to R. Kelly or T-Pain, one who's able to sling the slang like it ain't no thing, while making epic musical moments. There's no filler, which isn't so stunning since this is an EP, and before there's even a moment of lackluster music, the large guest roster rotates another exciting name through.\\" Erin Lowers of XXL said, \\"While Ty Dolla $ign may not be the most lyrically endowed, it‚Äôs apparent that his melodic deliveries illuminates the chopped and screwed music soundscape. Enhanced with layered synths and hyperactive basslines, Beach House EP is an open narrative about sexual politics and hedonistic satisfaction. Despite offering ratchet R&B; at its finest, Ty Dolla $ign fails to provide a memorable experience that differs from his previous two mixtapes.\\" Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a negative review saying, \\"Beach House EP is cringeworthy, brainless hip hop at its worst. It's like listening to a lobotomised T-Pain perform an album written by Yo Gotti, without the polished delivery of either. The one redeeming feature is DJ Mustard's infectious, deceptively simple production. It's barebones, yet could give genuine talent the perfect platform to weave their magic on - unfortunately Ty Dolla Sign just isn't the person to deliver 'magic'.\\" = Accolades = Complex named it the fourteenth best album of the first half of 2014. Writing for them, Ross Scarano said, \\"Even when he's putting together a slim, seven-song EP, L.A. R&B; songwriter and dick-slinger Ty Dolla $ign can't resist a spoken-word intro.

In the play, Don Pedro visits his friend Leonato in Messina, Italy while coming back from war. He also helps bring together one of the play's major couples, Beatrice and Benedick. His illegitimate brother, Don John, is jealous of Don Pedro and plots to ruin Don Pedro's best friend Claudio's wedding. Don Pedro is considered a character that is the middleman in the story and seems to understand the events more than the other characters. However, Don Pedro also experiences some dramatic irony: For example, he does not know that it is Don John who ruins the wedding until his henchman, Borachio, admits it. Don Pedro has been portrayed by Denzel Washington in the Samuel Goldwyn Company 1993 film Much Ado About Nothing. He was played by Reed Diamond in Joss Whedon's interpretation of the play, which was released in 2012.  Origins  A potential source of the character of Don Pedro is King Piero d'Aragona from Bandello's twenty-second novella. In the novella, the favourite of King Piero woos a young woman named Fenicia. This parallels how Don Pedro's favourite, Claudio, pursues a young woman, Hero. King Piero, in the Bandello story, was based on the historical figure Peter III of Aragon who became King of Sicily in 1282 after the violent uprising of the Sicilian Vespers. Much Ado About Nothing was written while Messina, in Sicily, was part of the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon. Hence Don Pedro's presence in Italy despite being a Spanish Prince. In many editions, Don Pedro is referred to in his speech prefixes simply as \\"Prince\\". = Name Meaning = The name Pedro is the Spanish version of the name Peter. Don is a Spanish honorific that was reserved for Spanish royalty. Though he is called Pedro in the speech prefixes, Don Pedro is introduced as Don Peter in both the Folio and first quarto editions.  Role in the play  Much Ado About Nothing begins with Leonato announcing that Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, is coming to Messina. Don Pedro arrives with Benedick, Claudio, and his bastard brother, Don John. Leonato invites Don Pedro and company to stay with him and his family. Don Pedro resolves to help Claudio woo Leonato's daughter Hero by disguising himself as Claudio. At Leonato's party, Don Pedro woos Hero on Claudio's behalf, but Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro betrayed him and wooed Hero for himself. After Claudio's misunderstanding is resolved and he and Hero are engaged, Don Pedro offers marriage to Beatrice who quickly turns him down. After Beatrice and Benedick leave the party, Don Pedro hatches a plan to trick Beatrice and Benedick into falling in love with each other. Don Pedro, Leonato, and Claudio discuss how Beatrice is in love with Benedick in front of a hiding Benedick to gull him into loving her. Don John tricks Don Pedro and Claudio into thinking Hero has been unfaithful to Claudio, who, with the support of Don Pedro, accuses Hero at their wedding. Even after hearing that Hero has supposedly died, Don Pedro supports Claudio and condemns Hero for being dishonourable. Dogberry reveals Don John's lies to Don Pedro and Claudio. The next day, Don Pedro's original scheme works out and Beatrice and Benedick are married. Benedick tells Don Pedro that he should \\"Get [himself] a wife\\".  Analysis  Don Pedro's goodness serves to balance out the Don John's wickedness. Many critics contrast Don Pedro's well-intentioned deceptions, both of Beatrice and Benedick and of Hero, with Don John's bitter and malicious deception of Claudio and Don Pedro. Don Pedro is the only character in Much Ado About Nothing to encourage a female character to speak. He tells Beatrice \\"Your silence most offends me.\\" In Janice Hayes's reading of Much Ado About Nothing, Claudio regards Don Pedro as a father figure; Claudio is thus afraid of engaging in \\"oedipal competition\\" with him over Hero. There has been some debate as to the meaning of Hero's line, about Don Pedro, \\"Why then, your visor should be thatched\\". A. G. Newcomer interprets this line to refer to Don Pedro's baldness. Hilda Hulme interprets \\"thatch\\" to possibly refer to pubic hair rather than head hair. Others, such as Joost Daalder, follow Hulme's reading. Another possibility is that this line refers to Don Pedro's lack of a beard. It is additionally possible that this line refers to Don Pedro's mask being overly ornate and is a suggestion from Hero that his mask should be more humbly decorated. Contrarily, the mask itself could be lacking hair. In any case, the line is a put-down of Don Pedro.  Performance history = Theatre = Asia  In the 1979‚Äôs Karasawagi, a Japanese language production of Much Ado About Nothing in Tokyo, the characters were given Japanese names. Don Pedro became Hyodo. The production was set during the Meji-era and Hyodo was depicted as having anti-Meji sentiments. In 1986 in Shanghai, China, Much Ado About Nothing was adapted into Huangmei opera and featured Wang Shaofang as Don Pedro.  Australia  In 1996, Ivar Kants played Don Pedro in the Bell Shakespeare Company‚Äôs production, which toured Australia.

Clive Wood's 2002 Don Pedro was described as \\"nervously enthusiastic, well turned-out, and slightly camp\\" upon his arrival at Messina. Shiv Grewal's 2012 Don Pedro was just returning from a peace-keeping mission with the UN. At Shakespeare's Globe in London, the role of Don Pedro has been performed by Ewan Stewart (2011) and Steve John Shepherd (2017). In 2005, Charles Edwards played Don Pedro in Peter Hall's production at the Theater Royal in Bath. Edwards' Don Pedro has a \\"homosexual fixation with Claudio\\" which explained his willingness to believe Hero's unfaithfulness and thus prevent Claudio from marrying. Edwards later went on to play Benedick in Much Ado in 2011 at Shakespeare's Globe. In 1993, Jack Ellis played Don Pedro at the Queen's Theatre in London. James Garnon played Don Pedro in Mark Rylance's 2013 production at The Old Vic in London. Adam James played Don Pedro in Josie Rourke's 2011 production at the Wyndham Theatre.

He served as Governor of Paraguay from March 4, 1649 - October 1, 1649. He ordered the first expulsion of the Jesuits from the Governorate of Paraguay, although this expulsion did not last; he was deposed as governor following a battle against the Jesuit armies. Early life He was born Crist√≥bal de C√°rdenas in La Paz, Upper Peru. He studied theology at the Jesuit College of San Martin in Lima, and changed his given name to Bernardino upon joining the Franciscan order. C√°rdenas served at the Convent of Chuquisaca in 1614‚Äì1620 and as a missionary among the Quechua Indians in 1621‚Äì1627, and traveled through both Upper and Lower Peru. C√°rdenas impressed the Real Audiencia of Charcas, and was appointed Bishop of Paraguay in 1638. However, it was not until 1641 that he left Upper Peru for C√≥rdoba to be consecrated as bishop by the Bishop in residence. There was a minor dispute first, however; the Bishop of C√≥rdoba was a Jesuit, and while the governmental approval of the appointment was complete, the papal bulls had not yet arrived, and the Jesuit order supported the idea that only the pope could ordain a bishop. Nevertheless, the Bishop of C√≥rdoba consecrated C√°rdenas, and C√°rdenas departed for Asunci√≥n. Feud with Governor Hinestrosa C√°rdenas arrived in Asunci√≥n, the same year as the new governor, Gregorio de Hinestrosa. Both men were proud, and a feud for power developed between the two. The feud eventually expanded to include the Jesuit Fathers as well, who managed the nearby Jesuit Reductions. While C√°rdenas spoke warmly of the Jesuits at first, praising them in a letter written in 1643, the Jesuits eventually backed Hinestrosa, an open admirer of the Jesuits, in the political struggle between the governor and the bishop. In turn, this caused C√°rdenas to criticize the Jesuits; he claimed the Jesuits were teaching \\"heretical principles\\" to the Indians, and threatened to expel them from the province in September 1644. These stances gained C√°rdenas the favor of many of the Paraguayan settlers, who disliked the Jesuit missions as economic competitors among other complaints. Governor Hinestrosa turned to the Jesuit armies of Indians to take control of the situation in Asunci√≥n; he compelled the local diocese to depose C√°rdenas on the grounds his consecration had not been valid, and exiled him from Paraguay in November 1644. C√°rdenas left for Corrientes, where he continued to engage in a war of letters and propaganda against Hinestrosa with the support of his fellow Franciscans. However, the Jesuits won over the Viceroy of Peru, Pedro de Toledo. The viceroy ordered C√°rdenas to appear before the Audiencia of Charcas to answer the charges against him issued by the Jesuits and Hinestrosa. C√°rdenas disobeyed the order, claiming illness and old age, and remained in Corrientes. In 1647, he met incoming Governor of Paraguay Diego de Escobar y Osorio, and convinced him to allow his return to the province. C√°rdenas and Osorio both left for Asunci√≥n, and C√°rdenas was restored as bishop. The situation in Paraguay remained tense for two years, but stable. Governorship of Paraguay On February 22, 1649, Governor Osorio died. A quirk of history was that a Royal Decree issued in 1537 theoretically gave Paraguay the right to elect its own governor if the current governor was dead or otherwise incapacitated. A crowd of approximately 250 Paraguayans in the main plaza elected Bishop C√°rdenas as Governor on March 4 until the Crown should see fit to appoint a new governor; C√°rdenas allegedly said \\"the voice of the people is the voice of God.\\" Two days later, on the 6th, C√°rdenas ordered the Jesuits expelled from the province with the approval of the cabildo and the majority of the populace. Immediately upon the proclamation of the order, a mob broke into the Jesuit college of Asunci√≥n, sent the friars into the streets, and looted the building of its valuables. The reaction in the rest of the Spanish Empire was almost uniformly against C√°rdenas and his supporters. The new Viceroy of Peru, the Count of Salvatierra, ordered C√°rdenas to appear in Charcas and restore the Jesuits; he also declared that Sebasti√°n de Le√≥n y Z√°rate, Hinestrosa's Lieutenant Governor, should become the interim Governor of Paraguay. Le√≥n y Z√°rate, who had been at the Jesuit missions when hearing the news, returned to Asunci√≥n, but was denied entry. Le√≥n y Z√°rate returned to the missions and rallied an army of 700 mission Indians; C√°rdenas rallied several hundred Paraguayan militia in reply. The two sides met in a brief battle on October 5, 1649, in which the Paraguayans lost in a complete defeat. Twenty-two settlers died and many more were wounded. C√°rdenas was imprisoned by Le√≥n y Z√°rate, and the citizens of Asunci√≥n suffered what to them was the humiliating spectacle of an occupying army of Indians. C√°rdenas was eventually exiled from Paraguay and sent to Charcas in Upper Peru. Luckily for C√°rdenas, in the time he was held at Charcas, the Jesuits' fortunes were on the decline in the royal courts of Madrid after the Jesuits had supported the independence of Portugal from Spain. C√°rdenas was reprimanded for accepting the result of the election based on the old decree and for expelling the Jesuits without royal permission, but received no further punishment.

Its opening song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for that year. Plot The film chronicles the life of Mr. Sanchez (Anthony Quinn) and his struggles with the culture of poverty around him. A widowed farmer, he cares for his family in a marginal area of Mexico City. While being a hard worker who feels the duty to financially support his family, he is still an aggressive, domineering man and a womanizer. His main conflict is with his daughter, Consuelo (Lupita Ferrer), a rebellious girl who attempts to break free from her father. She strives to escape her role of dutiful daughter and pursue her own dreams. Consuelo likes to talk with her grandmother (Dolores del R√≠o), who secretly advises her to find a man and get married. This is the only way that she, an uneducated poor woman, can escape her father. Reception Among those in attendance at the film's American premiere, which was held on November 16, 1978, were U.S. President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter, both of whom were greeted by performers Ferrer and Quinn as well as director Bartlett. Quinn himself escorted the President and the First Lady to their seats. All proceeds went to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

As coach he not only turned Maties into the world's largest rugby club but forged 50 of his players into Springboks and got nearly 150 of his players selected for the Western Province team. Eleven of the 1906 Springbok touring squad to Britain \\"had developed under him at Stellenbosch\\". Mark√∂tter popularized the 3-4-1 scrumming formation which is now standard in rugby union, and thus created the position of eighthman as a loose forward. He has also been credited with entrenching the swing-pass among his players. Mark√∂tter was \\"one of the most influential and significant personalities in South African rugby, which he dominated\\" between 1903 and 1957.  Early life  August Frederick Mark√∂tter, better known as 'Oubaas Mark' or 'Mr Mark', was born on 10 June 1878 on the Berlin Missionary Society's Haarlem mission station, near Uniondale in the Western Cape, South Africa. He was the third son of missionary Christoph Heinrich Mark√∂tter (d.1893) and Mari Henriette (n√©e Beuster, d.1932). His parents had immigrated separately from Germany to South Africa, where they had met and married. When August Frederick was 15, his father was killed in an accident with a horse-drawn carriage at Humansdorp, where he was buried. His mother remarried in 1896. Young Mark√∂tter showed great promise as a student, succeeding with honours in schools at Haarlem and Uniondale, and under a Mr Stucki at Blouvlei. It is at Blouvlei that he received the nickname 'Oubaas', by which he would be known for the rest of his life.  Rugby playing career  In April 1893 Mark√∂tter enrolled at Victoria College in Stellenbosch, where he took up rugby at the age of 16. He made his first appearance in the third team as a full-back against a side from Hamiltons. Assiduous practicing moved him into the second team, where he switched to fly-half. Proving to be \\"a hard and committed tackler\\" he made the first team in 1894, for which he continued to play until 1897. His teammates and friends included 1903 Springbok Japie Krige, with whom he would later open a lawyer's firm in Stellenbosch. Mark√∂tter was also a keen cricketer and tennis player. After gaining his BA in 1898 he wrote in a letter, \\"I definitely decided to dedicate the rest of my life to rugby football\\". He accepted a position as teacher at Paarl Gimnasium for 9 months, and turned out for Paarl's rugby club. He began training as a lawyer, and moved to Cape Town, where he played for Villagers. After qualifying in 1901 at Cape Town, he opened his first practice at Wellington, where he continued his rugby career in the town team. In 1903 Mark√∂tter moved to Stellenbosch as a partner in the firm Krige and Mark√∂tter. He captained the town team which went unbeaten that entire season. He was appointed captain of the Western Province Country XV which beat Mark Morrison's visiting British and Irish Lions team 13-7 at Newlands. This marked the first time that a Lions team had been defeated by a non-test side in South Africa. A severe knee injury that he sustained in a 1904 cricket match ended his career as rugby player. Subsequently, he turned to coaching, establishing a reputation for \\"uncompromising coaching methods\\".  Legacy  Mark√∂tter adopted and adapted the 3-4-1 scrum formation that had been developed independently by Springboks Fairy Heatlie in 1901 while playing for Villagers and applied on the 1906 South African tour of Britain by fellow Villager Paddy Carolin. Mark√∂tter's contribution was to coach his players to wheel the formation after which the No. 8 would pick up the ball and break.

An Australian international and New South Wales interstate representative goal-kicking centre, he played in Sydney's New South Wales Rugby Football League for the St. George club, with whom he won the 1949 NSWRFL Premiership. McCoy also played for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs club, and in Country New South Wales and Queensland as a captain-coach, representing both City and Country New South Wales, as well as Central Queensland during his career. Playing career Originally from Wolumla, New South Wales where he broke into the first grade rugby league team at age 15, during World War II he served as an anti-aircraft gunner and played rugby league in Darwin. After a car accident which resulted in a serious eye injury, McCoy was relocated to Sydney and started playing first grade football in the New South Wales Rugby Football League for the Eastern Suburbs club during the 1945 NSWRFL season. After the war ended he returned to the South Coast where he captain-coached Bega Roosters to premiership honours and in 1947 represented Country New South Wales against City at the Sydney Cricket Ground before a crowd of 50,000. McCoy returned to Sydney and started playing for St. George from the 1948 NSWRFL season and in the final games of the season he captained the club. He was selected to play representative football for City NSW, kicking seven goals against Country in pouring rain in 1949. Later that year he played for St. George in the 1949 NSWRFL season's grand final at centre, scoring a try and kicking a goal in their 19-12 victory against South Sydney. After that McCoy was selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian national team, becoming Kangaroo No. 268 and appearing in the two Test matches, scoring the match-winning try in the second one to level the series. He was the tour's top points scorer with 55 from 7 games. A knee injury cut short McCoy's time with St. George and he didn't play any football in 1953, instead coaching St George's juniors to win their competition. After that he would play the remainder of his career as a captain-coach, moving to Queensland and joining Rockhampton's Fitzroy club. The following year McCoy played in the Riverina for Leeton's club. In 1957 he returned to Rockhampton with Fitzroy and the following year joined the Christian Brothers club. McCoy's final year of playing was in 1959 with Townsville's Centrals club. Post playing Following his football career, McCoy had a successful career in Sydney's cricketing competition as a batsman. In March 2004 a Legends Walk at Kogarah Oval was opened, with 16 club greats, including McCoy, inducted into a hall of fame. McCoy died in hospital at Baulkham Hills, New South Wales on 20 February 2007. In 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia, McCoy was named in the Queensland Rugby League Central Division's team of the century.

The A.R.C. held their race meetings on the \\"Old Adelaide Racecourse\\" (later known as Victoria Park) which they rented from the Adelaide City Council, while the S.A.J.C. owned Morphettville Racecourse freehold. History The club had its origin, following the collapse of the first S.A.J.C., in a meeting called in December 1869 by Sir J. H. Fisher, John Baker, E. Holland, Joseph Gilbert, John Morphett, John Crozier, H. R. Fuller, M.P., and W. W. Tuxford, and a subsequent race run at the \\"Old Adelaide Racecourse\\" by a group which included William Blackler, Seth Ferry, Gabriel Bennett, George Church, Dr. Robert Peel and Dr. Thomas Cawley on New Year's Day 1870 A racy read but a little short on detail. and substituting in part for the S.A.J.C.'s customary three-day Summer Meeting. :The S.A.J.C. re-formed in 1875 and in 1876 was given the use of what became the Morphettville Racecourse at a peppercorn rental by the owner, Sir Thomas Elder. A year or two later they acquired the land freehold. Around the same time, Bennett, Blackler, Ferry and Peel secured, with a right to enclose and charge admission, the lease of the Old Course, and several successful events were held there in each of the following three years. In October 1879 a meeting held to formalize a Club decided to adopt a modified version of Victorian Racing Club rules; the committee to consist of the four lessees plus three elected members: G. Church, Henry Hughes, and W. F. Stock were proposed and elected unanimously. C. J. Coates, a tireless worker for the sport, was absent through illness. (Charles James Coates (6 January 1820 ‚Äì 9 October 1889), a longtime secretary of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society and outgoing secretary of the S.A.J.C. has been cited as a prime mover.) In 1879 a 21-year lease on the \\"Old Adelaide Racecourse\\" in the East Parklands was secured from the Adelaide City Council on behalf of the Club, at peppercorn rental but with substantial obligations to effect improvements, by Bennett, Blackler, Ferry and Peel. In late 1879 use of a totalizator on South Australian racecourses was made legal, (or more precisely exempt from provisions of the Gaming Act of 1875) and Seth Ferry purchased at the cost of ¬£300 a \\"box tote\\", which he leased to the Club at some profit to himself. Between 1880 and April 1882 three of the lessees dropped out for various reasons, leaving only Blackler and Ferry. As a result of the General Meeting of 17 September 1881, William Gordon was appointed secretary. Stewards elected were: H. C. Downer, M.P., W. Cavanagh, P. B. Coglin, R. Ingleby, Q.C., W. F. Stock, H. J. Morris, E. G. Blackmore, John Pile, H. Hughes, J. Bennett, William Blackler, Seth Ferry, Dr. Cawley, W. E. Ford. J. Cowan, and R. T. Moore; judges: William Blackler and J. Cowan; starter: Seth Ferry; race secretaries, John Harvey and W. Gordon. During the following six months several committeemen dropped out, alarmed at the club's ballooning financial liability, leaving the committee short of the quorum necessary to appoint replacements and powerless. The remedy resorted to was to re-form the Club, with the following elected pro tem: Stewards: J. Pile, H. Hughes, J.P., W. Cavenagh, J.P., P. B. Coglin, J.P., J. Crozier, H.T. Morris, J.P., J. A. Ellery, Dr. Cawley, and Messrs. W. E. Ford and J. E. Robertson. Committee: Messrs. H. E. Downer, M.P., S. Ferry, T. L. Cottrell, W. A. Blackler, W. Blackler, P. F. Bonnin, B. T. Moore, and W. Moorhouse. Bookmakers were charged 10 guineas to operate on the grounds. In 1883 a Melbourne \\"bookie\\", Joe \\"Leviathan\\" Thompson, refused to pay this charge, and sued the lessees for being refused admission. He won, but it was a Pyrrhic victory, costing both parties thousands of pounds. Thompson's true target may have been the totalizator, not the right of the lessees to charge entrance fees. The council, whose lease contract was found to be wrong in law, promptly rewrote it with allowable charges specified. In mid-1883 the \\"tote\\" lost its exempt status, and attendance at race meetings fell away. Then South Australia entered a period of economic downturn, brought about by the drought of 1884‚Äì1886, and the racing industry suffered; the A.R.C. disproportionately so, and Blackler felt the time was ripe to cut their losses, and outlined a plan whereby the Council would resume the course and recompense the partners, as they were keen to extend Halifax Street through to Fullarton Road, which would have cut the course in two. Ferry strongly disagreed, and there began the split between the two partners, which became quite bitter, at times to the point of farce. What followed was a few years of low-key meetings run by Ferry ‚Äî sufficient to satisfy the Council's requirements, but with modest stake money, consequently races with few starters dominated by Ferry's own stable, and poor attendance. Ladies in particular by this time preferred to be seen at Morphettville. :In mid-1886 a series of public meetings was held in Adelaide calling for reinstatement of the \\"tote\\", and several Bills were submitted by Rowland Rees, the second of which was passed by the Assembly as the Lottery and Gaming Act (Totalizator) in 1887 but rejected by the Council. Following the 1888 elections the Council passed an amended Bill which became law that same year. On 11 October 1888, with the economy on the rebound and the totalizator on the verge of becoming lawful, a meeting of interested sportsmen held at the Globe Hotel resolved to re-form the Club once more. A steering committee consisting of Ebenezer Ward, M.P., J. MacDonald, and Samuel James Whitmore was formed. In November 1888 the Blacklers agreed to take over the lease and the Club's debts to Ferry, assessed as ¬£2,500, and brought in a new co-lessee, John Pile. A provisional committee was formed to form a new Club: J. C. Bray, M.P., J. H. Gordon, M L.C.. Messrs. E. Ward, M.P., J. Pile, W. Blackler, J. McDonald, S. J. Whitmore. Gabriel Bennett, and Dr. O'Connell. In December 1888 the Licensed Victuallers' Racing Club (founded June 1888) joined with the rump of the A.R.C. to form a renewed Adelaide Racing Club with an additional 250 members, with the Victuallers' committee augmented by W. Robertson, John Pile, S. R. Wilson, and R. C. Cornish. S. R. Heseltine, a wine and spirit merchant, was appointed to the committee in February 1891, and in July 1893 he became secretary, a position he treated as a full-time responsibility, having relinquished his business interests before taking it on. For 16 years he had a close working relationship with the club chairman W. B. Carr, the two being largely responsible for the club's revival in the eyes of the public. Heseltine died in 1920 and was succeeded by Hiram Wentworth Varley (died 1927), then in 1927 by Heseltine's son, also named Samuel Richard Heseltine. Amalgamation Rivalry between the A.R.C. and the S.A.J.C. was for some time quite intense, and at one stage deteriorated to such an extent that operation of racing in the State was affected. A case in point was the disqualification of the horse Mata by the V.R.C., which they notified to the S.A.J.C., but who perversely refrained from passing on the information. By the time the A.R.C. found this out, from a newspaper item, Mata had been accepted to run in the 1881 Adelaide (Queen's) Birthday Cup. They refused to scratch the horse, no doubt to needle their antagonist, and Mata won the Cup, to the great enjoyment of the racegoing public, and the S.A.J.C. was admonished by the powerful V.R.C. The A.R.C. had been a considerable winner by the introduction of the Totalizator, more so than the S.A.J.C., who used their considerable influence in Parliament to have reduced the number of days the \\"tote\\" could legally be operated. This should have only affected the A.R.C., but the momentum thus created led to the Totalizator Repeal Act of 1883, and the S.A.J.C.'s subsequent insolvency, another case of \\"biting off one's nose to spite the face\\". Numerous attempts were made to amalgamate the S.A.J.C. and the A.R.C.: *In 1880 Sir Thomas Elder hosted meetings of steering committees, whose agreement to reconcile the two groups was subverted. The author, Gabriel Bennett, was a former S.A.J.C. committeeman. *In 1885 a new company, the Racing and Coursing Club, of South Australia, led by J. Rounsevell and Simeon Barnard was formed to purchase the assets of both clubs, and thus form a single entity which could develop the Morphettville racetrack to include a plumpton, but refused to countenance the value Blackler and Ferry put on the sumptuous facilities at their \\"Old Course\\". The neighbouring colony of Victoria had a similar history of two competing thoroughbred racing clubs, but theirs was resolved in 1863 with the formation of the Victoria Racing Club under secretary R. C. Bagot.

In late December 2013, a tropical disturbance developed to the north of Madagascar. With favorable conditions, the low developed into a disturbance and soon into a depression on December 28\\\\. The system continued to develop and intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bejisa on December 29, with rapid intensification occurring. It developed into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on December 30, reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Bejisa weakened, but re-intensified to a secondary peak of 160 km/h (100 mph) on January 1\\\\. Increased wind shear weakened the eyewall, which passed within 15 km (9 mi) of R√©union. After having moved generally south-southeastward for much of its duration, Bejisa turned to the southwest on January 3, by which time it had weakened to tropical storm status. It became a post-tropical cyclone on January 5 after the convection weakened over the center, and Bejisa became extratropical the next day as it meandered southwest of Madagascar. In its formative stages, Bejisa brought heavy rainfall to Seychelles, and it also dropped rainfall in Mauritius and Madagascar. Effects were worst on R√©union, where wind gusts were around 130‚Äì150 km/h (80‚Äì90 mph) along the coast. The storm also dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at at a volcano in Cilaos. The winds and rains downed many trees and power lines, which blocked roads and left 181,000 people without power. About 49% of the island also lost water supply. Bejisa left heavy damage to the agriculture industry, mainly to vanilla and sugar cane, totaling ‚Ç¨62 million (US$84.8 million) in losses. The commune of Saint-Paul sustained moderate damage, with losses estimated at ‚Ç¨3 million (US$4.1 million). Bejisa killed one person on the island due to head trauma, and there were 16 injuries. Later, the cyclone produced high waves in South Africa. Meteorological history In late December 2013, computer forecast models began to predict the development and cyclogenesis of a disturbance within the monsoon trough north of Madagascar. At 1800 UTC on December 27, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) noted a discrete area of disturbed weather approximately north-northwest of R√©union that corresponded with model forecasts and had the potential to develop. Accompanied by a low-level circulation center, the monitored storm complex developed rainbands about its southern periphery the following day. At 1200 UTC on December 28, M√©t√©o-France deemed the system sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical disturbance, the fourth system to be given such a classification by the agency that season. Upon its designation, the disturbance was analyzed to have an unusually high barometric pressure, based on nearby weather station observations. M√©t√©o-France projected for the system to peak as a tropical cyclone before slightly weakening and impacting the Mascarene Islands. Tracking southward, the disturbance steadily organized following December 28\\\\. As a result of wind shear, the system's low-level circulation center remained partially exposed, though the shearing conditions were expected to lessen At 0000 UTC on December 29, the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression. At 1800 UTC that day, the depression intensified to moderate tropical storm intensity, thus receiving the name Bejisa by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. This coincided with the improving satellite appearance of the storm's central dense overcast. Intensification subsequently quickened, and at 0600 UTC the next day Bejisa was considered to be a severe tropical storm. Concurrently a strengthening ridge in the mid-levels of the troposphere began to steer the storm towards the south-southeast. Following the development of a small pinhole eye, Bejisa was upgraded to tropical cyclone status at 1200 UTC on December 30, followed by intense tropical cyclone status six hours thereafter, with peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). In addition, the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), utilizing the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensity. The agency noted that decreasing wind shear, favorable outflow, and warm sea surface temperatures allowed for the intensification. At that time of the peak winds, Bejisa was located about 825 km (515 mi) north-northwest of R√©union. Cyclone Bejisa striking R√©union on January 2 The intensification phase of Bejisa was short- lived, as an eyewall replacement cycle resulted in a slight deterioration and fluctuation of the storm's organization and structure. On December 31, the system weakened below intense tropical cyclone status as the eye became less organized. When the eyewall replacement cycle completed, the eye became larger and the winds increased. Late on December 31, Bejisa passed about 125 km (75 mi) west of Tromelin Island. On the next day, the cyclone attained a secondary peak intensity of 160 km/h (100 mph). However, increasing wind shear eroded the eyewall, which opened the eyewall in the northern periphery. Despite M√©t√©o-France assessing that Bejisa had weakened, at the same time the JTWC estimated that the cyclone had intensified further to reach peak 1-minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) on January 2. That day, the storm's center passed within 155 km (95 mi) of R√©union while continuing to the southeast, and the eyewall passed within 15 km (9 mi) of the island. Continued wind shear stripped the convection, coupled with cooler water temperatures, and early on January 3, Bejisa weakened below tropical cyclone status. By that time, the ridge to the southeast turned the storm to the southwest. A slight decrease in wind shear was expected to allow the convection to rebuild on January 4, and the storm strengthened slightly. By January 5, Bejisa began evolving into a post-tropical cyclone, with weaker convection over the center. That day, M√©t√©o-France reclassified Bejisa as a post-tropical depression, noting that the radius of maximum winds had expanded. On the same day, the JTWC discontinued warnings after assessing that the storm had become a subtropical cyclone. Increasing wind shear displaced the remaining convection west of the center, and M√©t√©o-France discontinued advisories on Bejisa on January 6 after the exposed turned more to the south. The storm became extratropical and turned to the northeast, and was last noted on January 7. Preparations and impact Upon designation as a tropical disturbance, the predecessor to Cyclone Bejisa dropped heavy rainfall across the Seychelles. A weather station on Mah√© observed 164 mm (6.46 in) of rain over a 24-hour period beginning on December 27\\\\. The Farquhar Group were particularly affected, as the storm's incipient central region of convection remained over the area for an extended period of time. Before the storm affected R√©union, Bejisa passed west of Tromelin Island, producing winds of 80 km/h (49 mph). The storm also produced heavy rainfall on Mauritius, reaching at Sans Souci. Bejisa spawned a tornado in Grand-Gaube and Poudre d‚ÄôOr. Rainfall and gusty winds also affected portions of Madagascar. Later, Bejisa produced high waves along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. =R√©union= Saint-Dennis after Cyclone Bejisa In advance of the storm striking R√©union, officials advised residents to remain inside. Officials ordered residents in Saint-Leu along the coast to evacuate inland, and at least 300 people evacuated island-wide. The airport at Saint-Denis was closed, but reopened after the storm passed the island; several flights were canceled as a result. The main port was also closed, as were most childcare facilities, and mail service was suspended. Officials issued a red alert for the island, the first since Cyclone Dumile a year prior. On R√©union, Bejisa produced strong wind gusts, averaging 130‚Äì150 km/h (80‚Äì90 mph) along the coast, and peaking in Saint-Louis. The winds downed numerous trees and power lines, leaving an estimated 181,000 people without electricity, and closing roads due to debris. All eight of the island's high tension lines were affected. Thirty percent of cell phone service was temporarily lost due to the outages. Torrential rains impacted much of the island, with a 24-hour total of measured at a volcano in Cilaos and measured in a nearby town. The rains caused rivers to rise, resulting in flooding. About 49 percent of homes lost their water supply. Tremendous agricultural damage occurred across R√©union, with some areas reporting 80‚Äì100 percent losses. Damage in the sector reached ‚Ç¨62 million (US$84.8 million) alone, mostly to sugar cane and vanilla. The commune of Saint-Paul sustained moderate damage, with losses estimated at ‚Ç¨3 million (US$4.1 million). Approximately ‚Ç¨1 million (US$1.4 million) of this stemmed from wind and water damage to homes; 121 residences qualified for relief aid. Along the coast, a pier was destroyed, several boats were damaged, and roads were impacted. One person died from head trauma while 16 people were injured in various incidents. Two of the injuries were severe due to falling off ladders while attempting to secure their homes during the high winds. In the wake of Bejisa, √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) deployed 500 personnel and 6 helicopters to restore power on the island. Within three days, roughly 160,000 residences were restored, considerably faster than previous restoration efforts in previous cyclones. By January 9, all but a few dozen homes had power. In addition, water supply was largely restored within four days. A state of national disaster was declared for R√©union on January 17, by Overseas Minister of France, Victorin Lurel. This declaration covered 16 towns on the island: Les Avirons, Cilaos, L'Entre- Deux, L'√âtang-Sal√©, Petite-√éle, La Plaine-des-Palmistes, Le Port, La Possession, Saint-Joseph, Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis, Saint-Paul, Saint-Pierre, Salazie, Le Tampon, and Trois-Bassins. Insurance estimates indicated that ‚Ç¨25 million (US$34.2 million) was needed for relief funding. Farmers were eligible for compensation under the disaster declaration; however, many voiced their skepticism following a lack of follow-through by the government to supply funds after Tropical Cyclone Dumile in January 2013. Ultimately, the affected farmers had to indicate their taxed losses by February 26 to receive the assistance. By April 2014, all farmers affected by the declaration were compensated.

She is an artist known for creating large paintings on unprimed canvas. Life and work She was born in Kent on 14 October 1934. Wylie studied at the Dover School of Art from 1952 to 1956 and later graduated from the Royal College of Art with an MA, in 1981. She lives and works in her Kent cottage, producing extremely large paintings on unstretched, unprimed canvas, in her signature loose, spontaneous style. Wylie was one of the seven finalists for the 2009 Threadneedle Prize, and one of the winners of the 2011 Paul Hamlyn Foundation Prize for Visual Arts. In 2010 Wylie was the only non-American artist represented in the Women to Watch exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington DC. In 2012, she had a retrospective at Jerwood Gallery, Hastings, followed in 2013 by an exhibition at Tate Britain, London that featured recent works. In September 2014, she won the John Moores Painting Prize. In February 2015 she became a member of the Royal Academy of Arts (RA Elect). In June of the same year she won the Charles Wollaston Award for \\"most distinguished work\\" in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. She has been invited to meet and talk with students in the significant artists series ‚ÄòArtists Promenades‚Äô at the Royal College of Art and given talks on her work at The Slade, Goldsmiths, Wimbledon College of Art, The Royal Academy Schools, The Royal Drawing School, John Moores Liverpool, the ICA and Tate Britain. Wylie has work in private and public collections including Tate Britain, the Arts Council Collection, Jerwood Foundation, Hammer Collection, and York City Art Gallery. In 2016 Rose Wylie: Pink Girls, Yellow curls was held at the St√§dtische Galerie, Wolfsburg, and she has also had a solo show at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin. Personal life Her husband was Roy Oxlade, also a painter. Wylie initially gave up painting to raise their family. Lack of money was not a limitation to her; she and her family had strategies to overcome this, offering informal painting classes at their house and turning the garden into a place for students to camp. In a short film, Wylie says that friends of her children asked why she was always dressed in the same clothes; her reply was ‚Äúas a radical non consumer, I prefer dealing with what I have.‚Äù In 1955 when Wylie was just 21 years old, studying art in Folkestone and Dover she was painted by Anthony Devas for the Aero girl ad campaign. She describes herself as being a ‚Äúrebellious art student‚Äù at the time, adding that her look was ‚Äúmore Brigitte Bardot than Mills & Boon cover.‚Äù It is apt that the painting is labelled, not with the true identity of the sitter, but with the fictitious advertiser‚Äôs title, Alice. As a young woman, Wylie regularly modelled for the artist John Ward and it was whilst his friend Devas was staying with him, that she sat for this Aero commission. She knew that the portrait would appear in Rowntree's Aero adverts and by the time she was at Goldsmiths College in 1956, it had already been published in the Daily Express, News of the World and People Illustrated.

The Gideon Cave and the slopes of Mount Gilboa can be seen in the right. Ma'ayan Harod () or Ayn Jalut ( ', lit. \\"the Spring of Goliath\\", formerly also ÿπŸäŸÜ ÿ¨ÿßŸÑŸàÿØ Palmer, 1881, p. 157 and in Hebrew), also known as Gideon's Fountain, is a spring on the southern border of the Jezreel Valley. Its traditional name, Ain Jalut, has been recorded since the 12th century; the name Jalut means \\"Goliath\\". In the 1920s it was Hebraized as Ein Harod after the land was purchased by the Palestine Land Development Company, following a connection to \\"Ein Harod\\" of the Book of Judges (7:1) made as early as 1856 by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, who later became Dean of Westminster and a co-founder of the Palestine Exploration Fund. In addition to the connection to the Biblical events of Goliath's death (1 Samuel 17) and Gideon's defeat of the Midianites (Judges 7), it has also been proposed as the location of Saul's defeat of the Philistines (1 Samuel 29); scholarly discussion continues and none of these identifications can be certain. The spring emerges from a cave known today as \\"Gideon's Cave\\" on the foothills of Mount Gilboa. The famous 13th century Battle of Ain Jalut that took place near the spring is considered a major turning point in world history; A small Palestinian village was established in the area in the late 19th century; according to medieval chronicler Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad there had been a prosperous village there in the Middle Ages. Today the spring is part of the Ma'ayan Harod National Park, administered by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.  Geography  The Gideon Cave from which the water emerge. The spring is located in the Harod Valley, which is the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley. While the Jezreel Valley is drained via the Kishon River to the Mediterranean Sea, the Harod Valley is drained through the Harod Stream (\\"Wadi Jalud\\" in Arabic) to the Jordan River. It is the largest of the springs emerging on the northern slopes of Mount Gilboa. The source of the spring as well as other springs in the Beit She'an Valley to the east, comes from fresh rainwater that percolate into the limestone hills of Samaria and collect in an underground water reservoir beneath the areas of the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Jenin. The water emerges from the hills as they incline north towards the valleys. At this valley the waters emerge from a natural cave known as \\"Gideon's Cave\\".Baretz (2015), p. 37 The spring's discharge rate is about 360 cubic meters per hour. According to the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1882, Victor Gu√©rin stated that the rock from which the fountain springs has been artificially hollowed into a cavern.Gu√©rin, 1874, pp. 308-310Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 101 Identification= Origin of the name \\"Jalut/Jalud\\" = The spring is first mentioned in the 12th century by the name Ain Jalut, meaning \\"Spring of Goliath\\".Quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 386 The origin of this name is believed to be in a legend, that the biblical battle between David and Goliath took place in this area. An anonymous Christian traveler from Burdigala mentioned in the year 333/334, a place near the city of Jezreel where biblical David killed Goliath.Robinson and Smith, 1841, volume 3, p.168 Zev Vilnay has mentioned a Kurdish-Jewish folklore song which puts the location of the battle at the \\"fields of Megiddo\\", in the Jezreel Valley.Vilani, 1978, p. 81 In the 14th century, Ishtori Haparchi, who lived in the region, has dismissed the connection of the spring to Goliath, as the biblical battle took place between Sokho and Azekah, located in Judea and not in the Jezreel Valley. = Identification of the spring with \\"Spring in Jezreel\\" = Haparchi instead identifies the spring with the biblical \\"Spring which is in Jezreel\\", where Israelite king Saul prepared his army before the Battle of Gilboa, in which he and his son were killed. The identification with the \\"Spring which is in Jezreel\\" was followed by Edward Robinson and Eli Smith, who wrote in their 1841 book Biblical Researches in Palestine \\"There is every reason to regard this as the ancient fountain of Jezreel, where Saul and Jonathan pitched before their last fatal battle;...\\". This identification was repeated by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley in 1856 and Victor Gu√©rin who explained in 1874 that although there is a spring closer to the ancient city of Jezreel, the spring in Ain Jalut is much larger and is therefore more likely to be the spring where Saul set his military camp.Gu√©rin, pp. 308-310 This identification was rejected by John Wilson in 1847, who identified the \\"fountain of Jezreel\\" at a location closer to the ancient city, known today as Ein Jezreel. Gidi Yahalom explained in an article in 2015 that the actual reason for the identification of the Spring in Jezreel in Ain Jalut and not in Ein Jezreel (known in Arabic as \\"Ain al-Metiyeh\\", the \\"Dying Spring\\"), is the small size of the Ein Jezreel in compare to the Ain Jalut. The spring often dries and Yahalom believes that the scholars identified the Spring in Jezreel with Ain Jalut probably visited in years when the spring of Ein Jezreel was dry. = Identification with \\"Ein Harod\\" = Besides the \\"Spring which is in Jezreel\\", Gu√©rin and Stanley also identified the spring with \\"Ein Harod\\", mentioned in the Book of Judges, in the context of Gideon and his battle with the Midianites.Judges 7: Gideon's Army of Three Hundred This identification was repeated by Henry Ridgeway in his 1876 book \\"The Lord's land\\". Ein Harod was also identified with Ain Jalut by the Encyclopaedia Biblica in 1903. George Adam Smith followed the identification with Ein Harod in 1920,Smith, 1920, p.397 but identified the \\"fountain which is in Jezreel\\" in Ein Ganim (Jenin), on the other side of Mount Gilboa. He suggested that \\"Jezreel\\" in that context wasn't the city but the name of the district in which the biblical spring was located.Smith, 1920, p. 402 Ain Jalut in the left Gidi Yahalom claimed in 2015 that the name \\"Jalut\\" is a corruption of the name \\"Gilead\\", which means a \\"heap of stones\\". In Book of Joshua 7:3, Gideon addresses his men and call all fighters who \\"tremble with fear\\" to stand and watch from \\"Mount Gilead\\". Yahalom states that from the Gilead Mountains in Transjordan the battle could not be seen, so this place should be elsewhere. He mentioned an archaeological discovery in Mount Saul, one of the Gilboa's peaks south of the spring. A stone structure, fitting to description of a \\"Gilead\\" (8 meters/26 feet wide, 10 meters/32 feet long) with traces of human presence from the Paleolithic (Stone Age) to Roman times. Therefore, the place might have been known as Ein Gilead, and thus became Ain Jalut or Jalud (as \\"t\\" and \\"d\\" often interchange in Arabic). As for the name Harod, Yahalom suggest that the meaning of Ein Harod is \\"Spring of Gathering\\", as words from the root H-R-D are used in the bible to refer to gathering, especially in times of war. The record of three other major biblical or historical battles taking place in this specific region supports this theory. In 1882, Claude Reignier Conder identified in the \\"Well of Harod\\" in a different place called 'Ain el Jemain, in the nearby Beit She'an valley. An article published by Israel Finkelstein and Oded Lipschits in 2017 rejects the identification of Ein Harod in Ain Jalut, as they claim the biblcal battle actually took place near Shechem (modern day Nablus), after which the Israelites chased the Midianites to Succoth which is east of the Jordan River. They mention Josephus who puts the location of the battle next to the Jordan River in his 1st century CE book Antiquities of the Jews. Modern scholarship remains divided on the identification of the site.  Byzantine, Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods  The Itinerarium Burdigalense (586) notes \\"ibi est campus, ubi David Goliat occidit\\" in reference to a location just before Scythopolis. In the 12th century, a village or a town existed next to the spring and bore its name. Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, in his Life of Saladin, wrote that \\"The Sultan continued his march to el-Jalut, a prosperous village, near which there is a spring (ain), and here he pitched his camp\\".Life of Saladin, translated by Conder, p.89 Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions Ain Jalut as \\"a small and pleasant town, lying between Nablus and Baisan, in the Filastin Province. The place was taken by the Rumi (Crusaders), and retaken by Saladin in 579 (1183 CE).\\"Quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. 386 An archaeological survey conducted in the 20th century in search of the settlement did not find any settlement in the immediate vicinity of the spring, although two settlement sites were discovered in the adjacent community settlement of Gidona and the nearby Giv'at Yehonatan (\\"Jonathan's Hill\\"). In the immediate vicinity of the spring the surveyors did find flour mills, the remains of an aqueduct which are both dated to Islamic times (either before or after the Crusades). The surveyors also found a burial tomb and the remains of an oil press. In the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, the Mamluks defeated the Mongol army of Hulagu Khan which was under the command of Kitbuqa.  Palestinian Arab Village  alt=Sometime after the Sursock family bought the land from the Ottoman government in 1872, they established a small village here. In 1921, when the land was sold by the Sursocks, the nine families who lived here petitioned the new British administration for perpetual ownership, but were only offered a short lease with an option to buy.  Jewish settlement of Ein Harod  left 1940s Survey of Palestine map of the area The modern Israeli villages (kibbutzim) of Ein Harod (Ihud) and Ein Harod (Meuhad) began in a temporary farm and settlement established next to the spring. In the early 20th century the spring and the surrounding area were owned by the Sursock family from Beirut (modern-day Lebanon). In 1920, the Zionist activist Yehoshua Hankin, through the Palestine Land Development Company, purchased the territory, named the \\"Nuris Bloc\\", after a nearby Arab village, and compensated the 38 tenant farmers who lived there. In 1921, Hankin sent members of Gdud HaAvoda, a Zionist work group, to settle in the territory. Shlomo Lavi, among the leaders of the Gdud, had envisioned the \\"Big Kvutza\\", a settlement consisting of several farms spread on vast terrain with both agriculture and industry. His plan was approved by the World Zionist Organization, but with some limitations on his detailed vision. The Gdud began this settlement near the Ain Jalut which was known to Jews as Ein Harod. Yehuda Kopolevitz Almog, one of the Gdud's leaders, describes that in the first day the settlers set up tents and began enclosing their camp with barbwire and defensive trenches. The first 74 members pioneers were split into two groups. One of the Second Aliyah, former members of Hashomer and Kvutzat Kinneret, and the other from the Third Aliyah. In the first months, the settlers sowed fields, planted a eucalyptus grove, paved roads and dried swamps. An Ulpan, a school for learning Hebrew was set up in the camp. In December 1921, a second farm called Tel Yosef (after Joseph Trumpeldor) was established by members of the Gdud on the hill of Qumya. Disagreements on funds and internal politics have led Ein Harod and Tel Yosef to part ways in 1923, with many members leaving the former for the latter. The group that remained in Ein Harod included 110 members and was headed by Lavi, Yitzhak Tabenkin, Aharon Zisling and David Maletz. The group at Ein Harod continued to get little support from the Zionist organizations and after the 1929 Palestine riots, the members chose to move their camp from the area of the spring to the hill of Qumya, next to Tel Yosef and thus the settlement at the spring was abandoned. The spring continued to be used as a camp site for the pioneers of Beit HaShita and Dovrat before their departure to their permanent locations. In 1949 a village named Gidona was esablished next to the spring for Jewish immigratns from Yemen.  House and tomb of Yehoshua Hankin  House of Yehoshua and Olga Hankin, today a museum. The couple's tomb Yehoshua Hankin who purchased the lands wanted to move his home to the valley with his wife Olga. Their house was planned as a bauhaus and construction began in the 1930s just above the spring. Pioneers of Beit HaShita who camped at the spring helped the construction. Olga got sick and passed away in 1942. Yehoshua decided to bury his wife next to the house in a tomb inspired by the ancient Roman-Jewish tombs in Beit Shearim. Hankin died in 1945 and was buried next to his wife. The tomb's entrance was designed by Israeli artists David Palombo, who designed the gates of the Knesset. For some years the tomb was a pilgrimage site for women hoping to get pregnant. Israeli national park The well is now at the heart of a national park called Ma'ayan ·∏§arod.Ma'ayan Harod National Park The spring water are used to feed a recreational swimming pool. The house of Hankin has become a museum showing historical artifacts and life-size mannequins of the couple Hankin. Next to the museum is a war memorial for residents of the valley who died in Israel's wars. Next to the park is a Hostelling International youth hostel. Legacy of Ain Jalut One of the three original brigades of the Palestine Liberation Army was named \\"Ain Jalut\\", after the battle. In July 1970, Yasser Arafat referred to the modern area in the context of the historical battle: Also in Paul T. Chamberlin, Preparing for Dawn: The United States and the Global Politics of Palestinian Resistance 1967-1975, Ohio State University, 2009 > This will not be the first time that our people has vanquished its enemies. > The Mongols came and swept away the Abbasid caliphate, then they came to Ain > Jalut in our land ‚Äì in the same region where we are today fighting the > Zionists ‚Äì and they were defeated at Ain Jalut.

The structure was once used as a dovecote, and may have been a watchtower or prospect tower prior to this. It is a Grade II* listed building and scheduled monument. It has been associated with Bruton Abbey and the Berkley family who owned the estate after the dissolution. It is known that the conversion to house pigeons and doves took place around 1780. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1915 and they have managed the site since then undertaking restoration work. History Though the Bruton Dovecote's date of construction is not known precisely, the structure was built some time between the 15th and 17th century. Architectural historian Lydia Greeves suggests that the building was once within the deerpark of Bruton Abbey and was adapted by the monks from a gabled Tudor tower. However, John and Pamela McCann, authors of The Dovecotes of Historical Somerset, claim that the structure was not built until after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. The authors claim that the Berkley family, who acquired the lands of the Abbey, constructed the building as a prospect tower. Dendrochronological dating commissioned by the National Trust found that timber in the door and window frames came from trees felled between 1554 and 1586. The conversion to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although it is now a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up, it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961. In the 1980s the dovecote was inspected as part of an investigation into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of ¬£105,000. Location The dovecote stands on Lusty Hill to the south of Bruton overlooking the town. It is approximately south of the Church of St Mary, and south of King's School. It is on the Leland Trail. Architecture The square tower was built of local coursed oolitic limestone with Doulting stone dressings. The walls are thick at the base, and the tower is in plan. The doorway has an ovolo moulded arch which is high. This suggests a construction date in the late 16th or early 17th century. Another entrance was made for cattle to enter at a later date but this has been blocked up. Several of the windows have also been filled with stone. On the north-east face there were two-light chamfered mullioned windows on each floor while on the north-west wall they were one- and two-light windows. It has over 200 pigeon holes, which were installed after the original construction, possibly before 1780. Six tiers of nest boxes remain; however there were previously several more, possibly as many as 850. They are made of regular blocks of tufa each around square and deep.

Early life and study Arnold was born as the 19th of 24 children of Ivan, a tax gatherer, and Sofija, n√©e Vukaniƒá. His ancestors arrived from Switzerland during the French Revolution. He was born in Ivanec and spent his early childhood in Krapina. He attended primary school in Zagreb, and high school in Vara≈ædin and Zagreb, where he graduated in 1873. In 1874 he enrolled at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb majoring in philosophy, with a minor in history and geography. During the Bosnian crisis he was recruited, and it was only in 1879 that he was hired as a professor in a Zagreb gymnasium. In 1880 he was promoted as the first PhD in philosophy at the University of Zagreb, with a thesis Ethics and history (Etika i povijest), which was published in 1879. He continued his studies at the universities of G√∂ttingen (1880), Berlin and Paris (1881/1882).  Work  Since 1889 he served as the Director of the Royal Teacher's School. In 1894 he was appointed as a professor extraordinarius, and since 1896 as the full professor of theoretical and practical philosophy and pedagogy at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. He retired in 1923. He was the dean of the Faculty of Arts in the periods of 1898‚Äì1899, and 1912‚Äì1913, and also the rector of the University of Zagreb in the period 1899‚Äì1900. He was appointed as a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1891, and as a full member in 1899. He served as the president of Matica hrvatska in 1902‚Äì1909. In 1892 he became an honorary member of the Croatian Pedagogic-Literary Society, in 1924 a member of the Society of the Brothers of the Croatian Dragon, and an honorary citizen of Krapina. Writer As a writer, his work is a continuation of Croatia's romantic poetry in the tradition of August ≈†enoa and Franjo Markoviƒá. His first appearance as a writer was the song Pri povratku (\\"On the way back\\", Vienac, 1873, 49). He mostly published patriotic songs, romances and ballads with themes from Croatian history and folklore (Krapinske elegije, Damjan Juda, knez dubrovaƒçki, Kata Loviƒáeva etc.), as well as reflexive lyricism in publications such as Vienac (1873‚Äì1886, 1888‚Äì1891, 1893‚Äì1902 ), Hrvatska lipa (1875), Hrvatski dom (1876), Obzor (1898, 1900, 1901, 1904), Prosvjeta (1904‚Äì1913), Hrvatsko kolo (1905, 1906, 1908, 1930), Katoliƒçki list (1906, 1915, 1916), Hrvatska smotra (1907‚Äì1910, 1933), Hrvatsko pravo (1908, 1924), Koledar hrvatskoga katoliƒçkoga narodnoga ƒëa≈°tva (1909, 1910), Serafinski perivoj (1909‚Äì1913), Knji≈æevni prilog (1911, 1912, 1913‚Äì1915), Hrvatska (1912, 1914, 1915), Hrvatska prosvjeta (1914‚Äì1918), Na≈°a misao (1914, 1915 ), Jeka od Osijeka (1918, 1919), Vijenac (1923, 1925, 1927), Hrvatsko pravo (1924, 1925), Omladina (1924, 1925), Hraniloviƒáeva spomenica (1925), Selo i grad (1928/1929, 1930, 1931), Hrvatski list (1939), Novo doba (1940) and others. He wrote a single short story Samo ƒçetvrt sata (Vienac, 1880, 15‚Äì18). He signed his works in codes and pseudonyms: A., G. A., Gj. A., Gj. A-d, Gj. Ar., O. D., R. R., Ivanƒçanin, Georg Arnold. He published several books of poems, and the poem Domovina has gained him popularity. His works were published in many anthologies, calendars and almanacs. The selection of his poetry was translated to Czech, Esperanto, German, Slovak and Italian. He expressed his views on literature in talks at the Matica hrvatska conferences: Umjetnost prema znanosti, Mo≈æe li umjetnost zamijeniti vjeru, Jedinstvena hrvatska narodna kultura (Glas Matice hrvatske, 1906, 1908, 1909). Philosopher As a philosopher, he was influenced by Leibniz, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze, representing the \\"spiritualist positivism\\" movement and the view that the knowledge of the world can be reached only by the combined efforts of science, art and religion. He wrote on the fundamental questions of philosophy, which he defined as the science of \\"final causes and purposes of being\\".Logika, p. 40 In the treatise Zadnja biƒáa (\\"Last beings\\", Rad JAZU, 1888, 93 ) he conceived a world composed from the variety of simple, immutable soullike \\"last beings\\" that are connected by the feeling of touch and hierarchically arranged according to different levels of awareness, with absolute consciousness, the God, occupying the peak of the hierarchy. According to Arnold, faith represents the supreme stronghold of a man and the basic principle of harmony of his spiritual functions. According to some opinions, in his later works such as O psihologiji bez du≈°e and Monizam i kr≈°ƒáanstvo (Rad JAZU, 1909, 176 and 178) Arnold has abandoned his earlier philosophical views. Others such as Pavao Vuk-Pavloviƒá, Stjepan Matiƒçeviƒá and Bla≈æenka Despot however maintain that Arnold's philosophical view was uniform and consistent - spiritualist pluralism which doesn't completely exclude spiritualist monism. Arnold is one of the founders of the Croatian philosophical terminology, having authored two influential high school textbooks (Logika and Psihologija) that were standard textbooks for more than thirty years. At Arnold's proposal, in 1896 the Pedagogical Seminar for theoretical and practical training of future secondary school teachers was founded at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. As a teacher, organizer of educational system, the first Professor of Pedagogy at the Faculty of Philosophy and the first head of the Pedagogical Seminar, has influenced many generations of teachers. Arnold died in Zagreb.

Description Scorpaenopsis diabolus Biofluorescence of Scorpaenopsis diabolus The false stonefish has a broad head with a wide mouth, a humped back, and a tapering body, and can reach in length. Its dorsal fin has 12 venomous spines and eight to 10 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and five to six soft rays. The skin is rough with low conical projections, spines, and tassels. The colouring is a combination of mottled grey and white with reddish-brown blotches and the fish is well-camouflaged among stones and corals. The inner sides of the broad pectoral fins have orange, black, and white blotches and the fins can be \\"flashed\\" as a warning. This fish closely resembles the reef stonefish (Synanceia verrucosa). S. diabolus exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when illuminated by blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as red, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence may assist in intraspecific communication and camouflage. Distribution and habitat The false stonefish is found at depths to about in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its range extends from South and East Africa and the Red Sea to Japan, Hawaii, French Polynesia, Australia, and New Caledonia. It is found on the seabed among rubble, seaweed-covered rocks or on rocks encrusted with coralline algae on reef flats, lagoons, and the seaward side of reefs. Biology The false stonefish is a bottom-dwelling fish and is sometimes partially covered with sediment. It is an ambush predator and feeds on passing prey such as invertebrates and small fish. It flares its pectoral fins as a warning if disturbed by a potential predator. Its venomous dorsal spines can inflict a painful wound. ReferencesFurther reading *Allen, G.R. 1997.

It was founded in the early 17th century by a Persian, Dato Mogol, and flourished during the reign of his son, Sultan Sulaiman Shah. In 1680, after decades of conflict, the city was destroyed and abandoned; remains include forts, city walls, a Dutch cemetery and the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah. An inscribed cannon from Singora bearing the seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah is displayed next to the flagpole at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, London. The sultanate's history was documented in accounts, letters and journals written by British and Dutch East India Company traders; its destruction was discussed in books and reports authored by representatives of the French embassies to Siam in the mid 1680s. Sultan Sulaiman's family history has also been chronicled: Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II and mother of King Rama III, was descended from Sultan Sulaiman; present-day descendants include the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand and a former Navy admiral. Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon include articles published in academic journals and letters written by General Sir Harry Prendergast, commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo-Burmese war. History=Early history= alt=The Siamese vassal states in the deep south showed allegiance to Ayuthaya by sending tribute. Along with slaves and weapons, tribute consisted of the Bunga Mas, a small tree decorated with gold. The Sultanate of Singora, sometimes known as Songkhla at Khao Daeng, was a port city in the deep south of Thailand and precursor of the present-day town of Songkhla. It was located near the southern tip of the Sathing Phra peninsula, on and around the foothills of Khao Daeng Mountain in Singha Nakhon. British and Dutch East India Company traders called the city Sangora; Japanese officials knew it as Shinichu; contemporary French writers used the names Singor, Cingor and Soncourat. Singora was founded in the early 17th century by Dato Mogol, a Persian Muslim who accepted Siamese suzerainty and paid tribute to the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The port was said to be ideal and able to accommodate more than 80 large vessels; a network of overland and riverine routes expedited trans- peninsular trade with the Sultanate of Kedah. Jeremias van Vliet, Director of the Dutch East India Company's trading post in Ayuthaya, described Singora as one of Siam's principal cities and a major exporter of pepper; French traveller and gem merchant John Baptista Tavernier wrote about the city's abundant tin mines. A Cottonian manuscript at the British Library discusses Singora's duty-free policy and viability as a hub for regional trade: Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted ten years later when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen withheld tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting the help of the Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed. =Independence= In December 1641 Jeremias van Vliet left Ayuthaya and sailed to Batavia. He stopped en route at Singora in February 1642 and presented Sulaiman with a letter of introduction from the Phra Khlang (known by the Dutch as the Berckelangh), the Siamese official responsible for foreign affairs. Sulaiman's response sheds light on his attitude towards suzerainty: Later that year Sulaiman declared independence from Ayuthaya and appointed himself Sultan Sulaiman Shah. He modernised the port, ordered the construction of city walls and moats, and built a network of forts that spanned the harbour to the summit of Khao Daeng. Trade flourished: the city was frequented by Dutch and Portuguese merchants and enjoyed amicable relations with Chinese traders. Ayuthaya tried at least three times to reclaim Singora during Sulaiman's reign; each attack failed. One naval campaign ended in ignominy when the Siamese admiral abandoned his post. To help fend off overland assaults, Sulaiman assigned his brother, Pharisees, to strengthen the nearby town of Chai Buri in Phatthalung. Sultan Sulaiman died in 1668 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Mustapha. A war with Pattani broke out soon after, but despite being outnumbered more than four to one, Singora rejected attempts at mediation by the Sultan of Kedah and trusted in its army of experienced soldiers and cannoneers. During the late 1670s Greek adventurer Constance Phaulkon arrived in Siam. He sailed to the country from Java on a British East India Company vessel and, heeding orders from his employer, promptly embarked on a mission to smuggle arms to Singora. His escapade ended in failure when he was shipwrecked. =Destruction= Remains of the Sultanate of Singora include forts on and around Khao Daeng Mountain, a stretch of city walls, a Dutch cemetery and the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah (shown above). In 1679 Ayuthaya mounted a final offensive to quash the Singora rebellion. Samuel Potts, a British East India Company trader based in Singora, recorded the city's preparations for war: In a letter dated August 1679 Potts informed his East India Company colleague that the Siamese fleet had arrived and stressed the impending danger. The events that followed were decisive: in 1680, after a siege lasting more than six months, Singora was destroyed and abandoned. Contemporary French sources document the city's destruction and provide a wealth of detail. The head of the French East India Company's operations in Ayuthaya described how Singora's \\"tr√©s bonne citadelle\\" had been razed after a war of more than thirty years; a missionary working in Ayuthaya in the mid 1680s told how the King of Siam sent his finest ships to destroy the sultanate \\"de fond en comble\\" (from top to bottom). Simon de la Loub√®re, France's envoy to Siam in 1687, recounted a story about a French cannoneer who crept into the city one night and single-handedly captured the sultan: While Loub√®re's account of life in 17th-century Siam was well received by his contemporaries in France, the veracity of his tale about Cyprian and Singora's demise has been questioned. An article published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, for example, described it as \\"a story which might have passed in a romantic age, but it is too improbable for history\\". In a memo dated 1685 a French East India Company official claimed that Singora was finally captured by means of a ruse. Thailand's Ministry of Culture supports this version of events and discusses a spy who tricked his way into the city, enabling Siamese troops to enter and burn it to the ground. =Cession to France= In 1685 Siam attempted to cede Singora to France: the hope was that the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, and asked for a trading post in Bangkok instead. Landmarks Typical of forts on the mountain is fort 4: it is built onto the slope of Khao Daeng, abutting the mountain at its rear and rising to a height of about 4.4 metres along the front. Internal dimensions are approximately 5.5 metres by 8.5 metres. After Singora had been destroyed, Sultan Sulaiman's sons were pardoned and assigned to new positions in Siam. Later generations of Sultan Sulaiman's family were closely connected with Siamese royalty: two of Sulaiman's descendants commanded armed forces led by Prince Surasi in the 1786 conquest of Pattani; Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II and mother of King Rama III, was also descended from Sultan Sulaiman. Present-day descendants include Admiral Niphon Sirithorn, a former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand; and a family of silk weavers at the Muslim village of Phumriang in Surat Thani. =The forts at Khao Daeng= Thailand's Ministry of Culture details the remains of fourteen forts on and around Khao Daeng Mountain. Forts 4, 8 and 9 are well preserved and characterise the sultanate's military architecture: fort 4 can be reached by ascending a flight of steps that starts behind the archaeological information centre, fort 8 is accessible via a stairway near the Sultan Sulaiman Shah mosque, fort 9 sits atop a small motte near the main road leading from Singha Nakhon to Ko Yo Island. Forts 5 and 6 occupy the upper slopes of the mountain and offer panoramic views of Lake Songkhla and the Gulf of Thailand. The two pagodas on the summit of Khao Daeng were built on the base of fort 10 during the 1830s to commemorate the suppression of rebellions in Kedah. In her book In the Land of Lady White Blood: Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History, Lorraine Gesick discussed a manuscript from Wat Pha Kho in Sathing Phra. The manuscript (which in Gesick's opinion dates from the late 17th century) consists mainly of an illustrated map about ten metres long that depicts Sultan Sulaiman's forts at Khao Daeng. A microfilm of this manuscript, made by American historian David Wyatt, is kept at the Cornell University Library. =The tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah= Located in a Muslim graveyard about north of Khao Daeng, the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah is housed in a small, Thai-style pavilion surrounded by large trees. The cemetery is mentioned in the Sejarah Kerajaan Melayu Patani (History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani), a Javi account drawn mostly from the Hikayat Patani. The text describes Sultan Sulaiman as a Muslim raja who died in battle and the cemetery as \\"full of nothing but jungle\\". The tomb is an object of pilgrimage in the deep south of Thailand, where Sultan Sulaiman is revered by Muslims and Buddhists alike. =The Dutch cemetery= About from the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman is a Dutch cemetery known locally as the Vilanda Graveyard. The cemetery is located within the grounds of a PTT petroleum complex; permission is needed to gain access. In 1998 an investigation of the cemetery was conducted using ground-penetrating radar. The survey yielded detailed radargrams showing subsurface lime coffins that belonged to Singora's 17th-century Dutch community. A paper discussing these findings was presented to the IV meeting of the Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society in Barcelona, September 1998. The Singora cannon The Singora cannon next to the flagpole in the grounds of the Figure Court at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, London. The cannon was one of several shipped from Burma to England at General Prendergast's request. While the sign in front of the cannon states that it was \\"made about 1623\\", two articles published in the Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society translate the date as 4 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1063, which in the Gregorian calendar corresponds to 26 September 1653. Following Singora's destruction, Siamese troops seized and sent to Ayuthaya an inscribed cannon. The cannon remained there until it was captured during the Burmese-Siamese war of 1765‚Äì1767 and transported to Burma. It was then taken by the British in the third Anglo-Burmese war (1885‚Äì1887) and shipped to England. In 1887 it was presented to the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London and put on display next to the flagpole in the grounds of the Figure Court. The cannon bears eleven inscriptions, nine of which have been carved in Arabic characters and inlaid with silver. One inscription refers to the engraver, Tun Juma'at Abu Mandus of Singora; another is set within a circular arabesque design and reads \\"The seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah, the Victorious King\\". Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon's journey to London include the Hmannan Yazawin (the first official chronicle of Burma's Konbaung Dynasty) and reports written by General Sir Harry Prendergast, commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo-Burmese war. The Hmannan Yazawin provides an inventory of weapons taken by the Burmese after the sack of Ayuthaya, noting that most guns were destroyed and only the finest pieces conveyed to Burma. Correspondence between General Prendergast and his superiors in India details ordnance seized during the Burma campaign and lists cannon sent as presents to Queen Victoria, the Viceroy of India, British governors of Madras and Bombay, the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Portsmouth and Plymouth dockyards, and the Royal Hospital Chelsea. A letter at the Royal Hospital refers to the Singora cannon as a Burmese trophy gun received from the Government of India in October 1887.

In entomology, the term labellum has been applied variously and in partly contradictory ways. One usage is in referring to a prolongation of the labrum that covers the base of the rostrum in certain Coleoptera and Hemiptera. In contrast, the commonest current use of the term is in the anatomy of the mouthparts of Diptera, particularly those in which the labium forms the bulk of the proboscis, such as in the housefly family. Typically, the labium is expanded distally into a pair of fleshy labella. In the early twentieth century it was argued that the labella are the modified labial palps, and that point of view still is seen as having merit.Crampton, G. C.; The sclerites of the head and the mouthparts of certain immature and adult insects. Ann. Ent. Soc. Am. 14, pp. 65-103. In flies such as the mosquitoes, that have long antennae, the labella are two separate organs, attached to the proboscis only at their bases, but in the flies with short antennae, such as the house fly, they are more or less fused to form a single structure. Flies with fused labella have food channels in the surface of the labella. These are called pseudotracheae. They form the \\"spongy\\" part of a housefly's \\"tongue\\".

He published five books of poetry, occasionally writing in Lancashire dialect, and won fifteen awards including a gold medal presented by the president of the United Poets' Laureate International. He was listed in the third edition of Who's Who in the World and appeared on television and radio reading his own work.Leaver, Eric. \\"Looms were mill poet's muse\\".

Early life  Nicholas Freeston was born in Kendal, Westmorland in August 1907 and moved with his family to Clayton-le- Moors, Lancashire, at the age of 8. One of ten children he started work in a cotton mill aged 12. According to a Daily Mirror profile of the poet from 1963, the first verse of one of his poems captured the challenges of his early life: :\\"A silver spoon was never mine. I cut my teeth on tears. And all the things that men call fine have passed me down the years.\\" He took a correspondence course in English during the economic depression of the 1930s when he was out of work for six years, but it was 1947 before his first poem was published. The Lancashire Evening Telegraph described how he bolstered his learning by taking evening classes with the Workers' Educational Association and reading immense amounts of poetry.  Poetry  Nicholas Freeston published his first book of poetry, Christmas Bells and Other Poems, in 1950, followed by The House of the Croft in 1952 and The First Christmas in 1953.Northern Daily Telegraph (Blackburn). 1955. He was able to publish the books thanks to the generosity of local patrons.\\"Weaver-poet's second book\\". Northern Daily Telegraph (Blackburn). 1952 A profile of the poet in the Northern Daily Telegraph, a local newspaper, told how Freeston had the 'unusual hobby' of writing poetry after working by day as a weaver at Messrs. Hindle and Warburton's Oakenshaw Mill [in Clayton-le-Moors]. Asked if his job was a barrier to writing poetry, he told the newspaper: \\"Not a bit of it. It is an asset. I get a lot of my ideas at the loom\\".\\"Weaver-poet gets ideas as he works\\". Northern Daily Telegraph (Blackburn). 1951. In 1955 the BBC radio presenter Wilfred Pickles selected two of Nicholas Freeston's poems for inclusion in an anthology of poetry and prose of the 'north counties' of England. The book, My North Countrie, featured Freeston's Lancashire dialect verses, 'Th' Art Lookin' Sackless' and 'A Bird Song Away'.Pickles, Wilfred. My North Countrie.

He donated proceeds from the book's sale to Nazareth House, a charity in Blackburn, Lancashire. Freeston's final book, a collection of 65 poems, was published in 1966, in response to numerous requests for his work.Freeston, Nicholas. \\"Author's Notes\\".

Freeston explained how he could only write when he could feel and see the words in pictures. \\"I'm not one of those commercial poets who can write to order\\", he said, explaining how he thought of his poems at the loom or walking along the street: \\"I recall something that has struck me during a day in the countryside or something remembered from my childhood.\\" :\\"They laid it low my tree, And why, I never knew, One said - 'twas for its ugliness, And some - it spoiled the view.\\"  Awards and recognition  Nicholas Freeston won fifteen awards for his Lancashire dialect and lyric poetry, and by the time of his death in 1978, was listed in the third edition of Who's Who in the World.

Retrieved: September 21, 2016. The film, loosely based on the story of Herman W. Lang, and the theft of plans of a top- secret bombsight, is the account of a worker at an aviation factory who is kidnapped by enemy spies. The opening credits contained the following written prologue: \\"This story is about a man who defended his country. His name is Joe Smith. He is an American. This picture is a tribute to all Joe Smiths.\\" Joe Smith, American was the first in a series of B films made at MGM under the supervision of Dore Schary who also wrote the initial treatment, based on \\"his own yarn\\". His story was later adapted to a postwar setting and new characters to become The Big Operator (1959).Eames 1982, p. 294. Plot In 1942, Joe Smith is a \\"buck an hour\\" crew chief on the Lockheed P-38 Lightning assembly line in a Los Angeles defense plant. When plant president Mr. Edgerton and his supervisor Blake McKettrick calls him into his office, Joe is grilled by two men from Washington, Freddie Dunhill and Gus, who later ask him to draw from memory a blueprint put in front of him. When Joe shows he can draw the plans accurately, Edgerton promotes him to head up a new project based on the top secret Norden bombsight. Unable to tell his wife Mary and fourth-grade son Johnny or even his co-workers, about his new job, Joe is targeted by a group of men who want the secrets of the bombsight. While he leaves the plant late at night, his car is forced off the road and Joe is brought to a deserted house. The four men who have kidnapped him, blindfold Joe and beat him, trying to force him to draw the plans of the bombsight. Remembering that his son also had a secret he was keeping no matter what he and his wife asked, and that Johnny was studying about Nathan Hale, Joe refuses to cooperate and is beaten severely. When the spies realize they have no option but to kill Joe, he is driven away but takes the opportunity to throw himself out of their car. An elderly couple come upon Joe lying in the street while the four kidnappers make their getaway. In recovery, even though he is blindfolded, he had snuck some peaks at the men who held him and tried to memorize sounds in their car that would identify where he was. When the police take Joe on a reconstruction of his drive, he slowly puts together the route and takes them back to a house where three men are confronted. Each of them has some identifying feature, but the ringleader is missing. Finally back home, Joe receives Gus, Freddie, Edgerton and McKettrick who are there to thank him for his bravery. When McKettrick shakes his hand, Joe recognizes the distinctive ring worn by the leader of the kidnappers. The police who are also there, arrest McKettrick before he can escape. One month later, on Father's Day, Mary and Joe have a party with their friends from work and Johnny gives Joe his \\"secret\\" gift, a tie. When his friends call Joe a hero, he rebuffs them, saying that there are no heroes in America, just people, \\"who don't like being pushed around.\\" CastProduction Although considered a war propaganda film, principal photography on Joe Smith, American took place from October 20 to November 11, 1941, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The prewar arrest of a German factory worker who stole the plans of the Norden bombsight was the basis of the story, with stock photography of the Lockheed Aircraft company incorporated to provide a wartime look.\\"Original print information: 'Joe Smith American'.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Their appearances are uncredited in the film and likely were extras. Reception In his review of Joe Smith, American, Theodore Strauss wrote, in The New York Times,\\"In its own simple and unassuming way, \\"Joe Smith, American,\\" now at the Criterion, does more to underscore the deep and indelible reasons why this country is at war than most of the recent million- dollar epics with all their bravura patriotism. In this film there is no martial music, there are no displays of armed armadas and no one pins a medal on anybody's chest. Instead, the author and director have simply taken one commonplace American and shown, in one tense and sharply cut event when his country's safety was at stake, how it was the little things, the small remembrances of what his life had been, that pulled him through.\\"Strauss, Theodore (T.S.). \\"Movie review.\\" The New York Times, April 2, 1942. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther gave Joe Smith, American an \\"honorable mention\\" in his \\"Ten Best Films of the Year\\" list, and several consumer magazines praised the low-budget film for its excellence. According to an article in The Hollywood Reporter on October 27, 1942, Joe Smith, American was one of 10 films selected by the East and West Association to be sent for exhibition in Asian countries as, \\"most nearly representative of life in the U.S.\\"\\"Notes: 'Joe Smith American'.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Early life  In a video for The Interface Project, Davis states how she was born with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and diagnosed as an adolescent after experiencing abdominal pain. Her testes were removed, but she wasn't told her diagnosis: she was told she had cancer. In an article for Ms. Magazine, she says:  Works =Book= Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis by Georgiann Davis examines the history of the U.S. intersex movement, with a focus on the medicalization of intersex bodies and a contested shift in clinical language from intersex to \\"disorders of sex development\\". Published by NYU Press, the book has been positively reviewed. Elizabeth Reis comments that Davis's work contains \\"piercing interviews and astute analysis\\", while Choice describes he book as a \\"compelling account of how activists, parents, assorted medical specialists and institutions, and people with intersex traits respond to the diversity of human reproductive development\\". =Scholarly and other works= Georgiann Davis has written both scholarly articles, and opinion articles for broader audiences.

A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes\\", a collaborative article with Katrina Karkazis, Rebecca Jordan-Young, and Silvia Camporesi, published in 2012 in the American Journal of Bioethics, they argue that a new sex testing policy by the International Association of Athletics Federations will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify \\"gender policing\\". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. In 2013, her article \\"The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits\\" was published in the American Journal of Bioethics. She questions the use of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis to select against intersex traits, arguing that intersex traits reflect necessary natural diversity; deselection of intersex embyros essentially protects \\"binary ideologies about sex and its presumed correlation with gender\\". She describes this as a form of sex eugenics that would \\"obliterate\\" an intersex community of individuals leading full and happy lives, a community that forces \\"society to disentangle sex and gender, and in the process, open up new possibilities for embracing all sorts of human diversity.\\" Further, if de- selection of intersex traits is ‚Äúmorally permissible‚Äù due to stigma and poor social outcomes, then \\"we need to recognize that a major source of the shame and stigma individuals with intersex traits face originates in the medical profession\\" = Selected bibliography =Scholarly works    Opinion pieces   * *  Academic interests  Davis is an associate professor of sociology at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where her academic interests include intersex traits, sex and gender, body and embodiment, and the medical profession.

It is the first and the oldest baroque church in Vilnius, built in 1618. The construction of the church began in 1604 in memory of the holy prince Saint Casimir. It was built by the Jesuits with funding by the Great Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Lew Sapieha. It is traditionally assumed that the corner stone (which can be seen on the fa√ßade wall) was pulled into the city by procession of 700 Vilniusites from the Antakalnis hills. The construction was finished in 1616, and the interior design completed in 1618. The Church of St. Casimir is one of the earliest exemplary Baroque buildings in the city. Its spatial composition and facade were designed along the line of the famous Il Ges√π church in Rome. The shape of the building was modeled after the churches in Krak√≥w and Lublin, with additional towers. The author of the design was Jan Frankiewicz, a pupil of architect Giovanni Maria Bernardoni. In the middle of the 18th century the church was reconstructed by architect Thomas Zebrowski. Under his supervision a stepped lantern cupola with a crown was erected. This large and impressive cupola is unique in the entire region of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Under Russia's occupation the church of St. Casimir was converted into a Russian Orthodox church. In 1915 Vilnius was occupied by the Germans and the church was converted into the Evangelical Lutheran prayer house of the Vilnius Garrison. In 1919 the church of St. Casimir was returned to the Catholics, but was damaged again during the Second World War, closed down and in 1963 converted into a Museum of Atheism. The church was reconsecrated in 1991. The church is known for excellent acoustics and organ concerts with renowned international musicians.

Brown declined compensation for her donation, believing what she had done was her patriotic duty. President Ronald Reagan wrote to her on her 80th birthday in 1987 to thank her, and in 1990 she received a special achievement award from the Colorado Aviation Historical Society during a ceremony at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.  Early life  Brown (n√©e Babnik, often misspelled Babnick) was born in Pueblo, Colorado, to Frank and Mary Babnik, immigrants from Slovenia. Her father worked at the railroad and her mother was a domestic helper. Her parents named her Mitzi, a Slovenian name, but she Americanized it to Mary. The oldest of the children, she had three younger siblings; her sister, Josephine, arrived in 1908, followed by two brothers, Frank in 1910 and Joseph in 1912. Brown spent her early childhood in the Bessemer and Grove neighborhoods of Pueblo. Her father abandoned the family around 1920, leaving her mother to raise the children. Brown left elementary school when she was 12 years old to help support the family. She first obtained part-time domestic work for $5 a week. By lying about her age when she was 13, she was able to find a permanent job at the National Broom Factory, which paid 75 cents a day when she started; she ended up working there for 42 years. Her siblings contributed to the family financially by picking up chunks of coal on railroad tracks that had fallen from steam-engine trains. Brown became a well-known dancer in Pueblo. She began dancing as a hobby in her early teens, winning her first dancing contest at the age of nineteen. She danced so often at the Arcadia Ballroom (now razed) on Fifth Street in downtown Pueblo that her nickname was \\"Arcadia Mary\\". During World War II she taught GIs how to dance. She had a saying: \\"My first love is my family, but dancing is my second.\\"  Hair donation  In 1943, she saw an advertisement in a Pueblo newspaper that said the government was looking for hair from women for the war effort, although no details were given as to how it would be used. The ad said only that they wanted blonde hair that was at least , and which had not been treated with chemicals or hot irons. \\"What she didn't know back in 1942 was that her hair was used as cross hairs in a secret bombsight used on bombers.\\" Brown's hair was long and had never been cut, chemically treated or heated with irons. It was her most prized possession. She washed it with \\"pure soap\\" twice weekly and combed it twice a day; it stretched down to her knees when she combed it out. She normally wore it wrapped around her head in a braid, and as a result was known as the \\"lady with the crown\\".Denver Post. July 5, 1987. First two paragraphs of newspaper article: \\"PUEBLO- Mary Babnik had long hair in the early 1940s. Her blond tresses, normally worn braided atop her head, stretched to her knees when she combed them out. At 36, Mary was proud of her hair, combing it twice a day and washing it with pure soap twice a week.\\" \\"She had begun braiding her hair as a toddler and called it her crowning glory. 'I had never had it cut,' she said. \\"I cried for two months . . I sent them all of it In 1942, Mary Babnik Brown was known as 'the lady with the crown' because of the long braided hair she wore wrapped around her head.\\" The government purchasing agent at the Washington Institute of Technology told her that her hair would be used for meteorological instruments.E. Leon Virts, US government purchasing agent (November 26, 1943). Letter, Washington Institute of Technology. She sent off samples, and they concluded that it would be appropriate. Brown agreed in 1944 to have it cut. The government offered to pay her for it in war savings stamps, but she refused, seeing it as her duty to help in the war effort. She ended up feeling traumatized by the loss of it, and cried for two months afterwards. Brown's hair was used in scientific equipment to make precise measurements of humidity, paramount in the production of military aircraft and other war equipment.  Norden bombsight myth  For many years it was incorrectly claimed that her hair was used to make the crosshairs in the Norden bombsight. However, as the crosshairs on the bombsight are etched into glass and not made from hair this is not possible.  Later life  Brown married Carl Brown sometime after 1944, and became Mary \\"Mitzi\\" Babnik Brown. In 1947 she became vice president of the State Federation of Labor, the first woman to hold that position. She also became an active member of the Pueblo Democratic party, and was the vice president and president of the Slovenian Lodge SNPJ (Slovenian National Benefit Society). She spent her last years of her life in the 300 block of Spring Street in Pueblo.

It provides context to its metrics so that they are meaningful without knowledge of the specific dataset: for example, instead of letting the reader guess whether having five forks on GitHub is common, ImpactStory would tell that the repository is in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repositories created that year. The metrics provided by ImpactStory can be used by researchers who want to know how many times their work has been downloaded and shared, and also research funders who are interested in the impact of research beyond only considering citations to journal articles. Unpaywall Unpaywall is a browser extension which finds legal free versions of (paywalled) scholarly articles. In July 2018 Unpaywall was reported to provide free access to 20 million articles, which accounts for about 47% of the articles that people search for with Unpaywall. In June 2017 it was integrated into Web of Science and in July 2018 Elsevier announced plans the same month to integrate the service into the Scopus search engine. In 2019, GetTheResearch was announced as a search engine for open access content found by Unpaywall, with machine learning features to facilitate discoverability. Unsub Unsub,https://get- unsub.org/ previously Unpaywall Journals, was launched in 2019 as a data analysis tool for libraries to estimate the actual cost and value of their subscriptions. The tool reduces information asymmetry in negotiations over subscriptions with publishers: in its paid tailored version, it allows to merge Unpaywall data about open access status and expected evolution in 5 years, article processing charges, usage statistics and the libraries' own parameters (such as the cost of ILL) to calculate various indicators including the cost effectiveness or net cost per use of a current or planned subscription (or lack thereof). Unpaywall Journals was used in 2020 by the SUNY Libraries Consortium to assist in the cancellation of their big deal with Elsevier, which was replaced by a subscription to 248 titles, allowing expected savings of 50-70 % over the baseline, or 5 to 7,000,000 dollars per year.

Prison camp Ovƒçara farm in 2005 Ovƒçara is located 5 kilometers southeast of the city of Vukovar. It is a desolate stretch of land where the Vukovar agricultural conglomerate built cattle-raising facilities after World War II. These facilities are storage hangars, which are fenced and can be easily guarded. The hangars are made of brick and have a big sliding front door, which includes a small door. The Serbian forces turned Ovƒçara into a prison camp in early October 1991. Aside from the massacre, 3,000 to 4,000 men prisoners were temporarily held in the camp before being transported to the prison in Sremska Mitrovica or to the local army barracks, which was the transit point for the Serbian detention camps Stajiƒáevo, Begejci and others. Some of the Serb forces were led by ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá \\"Arkan\\" who directed much of the pillaging and murder that occurred in Vukovar during and after the siege.Eric Stover and Gilles Peress: The Graves (1998), (Scalo. Zurich), p. 108. At the end of the battle of Vukovar and in the prelude to the Vukovar hospital massacre, numerous men were brought to Ovƒçara, including wounded patients, hospital staff and some of their family members, former defenders of Vukovar, Croatian political activists, journalists and other civilians.ICTY Outreach Programme: JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF \\"OVƒåARA\\"New York Times: Serbian Court Finds 14 Guilty in '91 Massacre of Croatians One member of the group standing trial in Belgrade for the executions testified that \\"among the prisoners, there were quite a number of civilians and wounded persons with bandaged wounds and casts\\", including a pregnant woman. Several witnesses at the trial, former JNA soldiers, also confirmed there were civilians present at Ovƒçara. The archive of the City Government of Vukovar has some testimonies of Ovƒçara prisoners. When they came out of the buses, they had to run between two rows of Serbian soldiers and other forces, who beat them with rifle butts, clubs and other blunt weapons. The beatings continued in the hangars; at least two men died from those beatings.Profile: The 'Vukovar Three' Ovƒçara was closed on December 25, 1991. Its total count was around 200 men killed and 64 missing prisoners. Massacre On November 18, 1991, which was the day when the battle of Vukovar ended, the Serbian forces captured the Vukovar hospital. They gathered the wounded fighters, civilians and hospital staff, put them in buses and transported them to Ovƒçara. The prisoners were brought together, massacred, executed by firearms, thrown in a trench and covered by earth. The Ovƒçara mass grave lies northeast from the facilities, one kilometer from the Ovƒçara-Grabovo road. It belongs to the category of the mass graves with the remains of prisoners of war and civilians executed in the immediate vicinity or at the very place of the grave.

It is located between the towns of Port Neill and Tumby Bay, north-northeast of Lipson Cove. Geography and geology The cape is generally barren of vegetation other than low scrub. To the north and south of the cape are a series of low headland-bound white sandy beaches, backed by low dunes and farmland. Public access is limited to the Cape Hardy track and there are currently no facilities present. The surrounding beaches tend to face east to southeast and usually receive low swell and wind waves less than high.  Early history  Cape Hardy is named after surveyor Alfred Hardy (1813‚Äì1870). The first European to explore this coastline, in 1802, was the British navigator Matthew Flinders, but, although he named many features, he did not name this cape. Later in 1802 the French navigator Nicolas Baudin also sailed past, giving it the name Cap Portalis, honouring the French jurist Jean- √âtienne-Marie Portalis, but that name was not used. The first land-based exploration by Europeans was in April 1840, at which time the cape was named after Alfred Hardy, then being the aide-de-camp to Governor George Gawler. Gawler was leading an expedition along this coast accompanied by explorer John Hill and Deputy Surveyor General Thomas Burr. The vice-regal party was supported at sea by the brig Porter and the government cutter , both under the command of Thomas Lipson. Pastoralism, farming, and fishing In 1898, A. Poynton and William Tennant Mortlock, the members for the South Australian electorate of Flinders presented a petition to the Commissioner of Crown Lands (Hon. L. O'Loughlin) requesting the consideration of the establishment of a dog fence running west across Eyre Peninsula from Cape Hardy to Mount Misery. The petition was drafted in response to pastoralists' struggles to manage vermin in the Lower Eyre Peninsula region. In April 1932, a piece of flotsam believed to be a hatch-cover from the missing ketch Vivid was found near Cape Hardy by Captain E. S. Hipkins of the ketch Nelcebee. Vivid was last seen departing Tumby Bay on 9 April 1932. As of 2014, the ship's fate and that of its crew remain a mystery.  Proposed export port  In December 2012, Cape Hardy was announced as the location for a prospective deep water port development. The port is planned to serve the export interests of mining company Iron Road Ltd and the development of the Central Eyre Iron Project. It received Major Project Status from the Government of South Australia in August 2013. In November 2015, Iron Road announced that an Environmental Impact Statement and Mining Lease application had been lodged with the South Australian Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure, which includes the port proposal. As of 2018, the project has received environmental and planning approval but construction is yet to commence. Iron Road Ltd remains committed to the project. = Alternatives = Another prospective iron ore mining company, Centrex Metals Ltd, proposed to construct an alternative port known as Port Spencer. Its site was located 9 km southwest of Cape Hardy, adjacent to Lipson Cove. That proposal was sunk in 2016, with this site being sold in 2019 by Centrex Metals to Peninsula Ports, which intends to develop Port Spencer as a grain-only deep-water port.

He studied architecture and painting in Antwerp. He lived and worked in the Dutch East Indies from 1903 to 1929. He was one of the first architects to implement Modernism in the Dutch East Indies. Moojen became widely known for his work on the Dutch entry at the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931. He was active as an architect between 1909 and 1931. As a member of the Commisie van toesicht op het beheer van het land Menteng, Moojen was influential in designing the town planning for Batavia's Nieuwe Gondangdia garden city (now Menteng). He established the Kunstkring for both Bandung (1904) and Batavia. As a painter he was a member of the Bataviasche Kunstkring and actively participated in exhibitions. Many of his paintings were kept in Amsterdam's Tropenmuseum. Moojen was interested in Indonesian culture, especially the ancient monuments. His Kunst op Bali (1926) outlined the ancient Balinese architecture. Moojen was the pioneer of a new building style in the Dutch East Indies. In 1912, civil engineer C.E.J. van der Meyl underscored Moojen's importance to the emergence of Modernism in the Dutch East Indies. Berlage made similar comment in his Mijn Indische reis (Rotterdam 1931). He reasons that in designing the Batavia's NILLMIJ office and Kunstkring Art Gallery, Moojen replaced the customary Classicist forms with \\"the realization of a more rational concept\\", an international architectural movement known as Rationalism, which was later dubbed as New Indies Style to refer this movement in the Dutch East Indies where it was slightly conformed to suit the local climate.

Some doubt has been raised as to whether the monogram is genuine and no other evidence exists to conclude that the artist should be identified with the Leonart Kroes mentioned as the teacher of Gillis van Coninxloo in the Flemish 16th century art historian Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck of 1604. Stylistic characteristics of his work suggest he may have spent time in Italy but there is no independent evidence for foreign trip. Lot and his daughters Based on the size of his output it is believed he operated a large workshop with several pupils in Antwerp. Work He is known for landscapes, religious works and genre scenes as well as a few allegorical compositions.Master of the Prodigal Son at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His only dated painting is a canvas of the Return of Tobit formerly in Berlin. In his religious composition landscapes often play an important role and also include still life elements. His Lot and his daughters includes a small see-through landscape with the city of Sodom burning and a still life of fruit on a plate, which are the precursors of the genres of landscape and still-life painting that arose during the 16th century. His work shows the influence of leading painters working in Antwerp in the mid-16th century, such as Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Pieter Aertsen, Jan Mandijn and Frans Floris. The sharply accented realism of some figures in his work is closely related to Pieter Aertsen. A certain Mannerism in his work approaches his work to that of Jan Mandijn and Frans Floris as well as the School of Fontainebleau. This aspect is most obvious in his compositions with large figures such as the Lot and His Daughters (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp} in which the figures have a sculptural character. The color of the skin is clear and, in the female figures, also has the shine of marble. The bearded figures, on the other hand, are closer to the work of Frans Floris and Pieter Coecke van Aelst. The Master of the Prodigal Son‚Äôs characteristic style of painting figures is shown in the triptych of the Adoration of the Magi (Christie's sale of 9 December 2016, London lot 101). The small faces, pointed chins and closely placed eyes, the large hands with defined finger nails and the figures walking as if ‚Äòon tiptoe‚Äô, are features which are typical of his style. The Master was also a designer of tapestries. He designed a series of 10 tapestries entitled The life of Tobias which was woven in various editions and variations. The series was often used as a wedding gift as it tells the story of how Sarah was liberated from the devil by her uncle Tobias on the night of her wedding. The Master used in his designs for the series the Renaissance architecture, men on horseback, flock and trees that are also present in the tapestries designed by his contemporary Bernard van Orley. However, due to the awkward placement of the figures in space the designs fail to convince.Guy Delmarcel, Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1999 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Anonymous artists ","title":"Master of the Prodigal Son"},{"id":"41518902","title":"Rewind That"},{"id":"41518904","text":"Edwin Earle (April 28, 1927 ‚Äì March 26, 2009) was an American professional basketball player.

The background to the reform was a series of recommendations by the World Bank in 1987 and the Delors White Paper in 1993.Bolet√≠n Oficial de las Cortes Generales, Congreso de los Diputados, 12 de abril de 1995. N√∫mero 134 Background In June 1993, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had lost seats to the conservative Partido Popular in the general election, leaving it without an overall majority. The PSOE depended on the support of the Catalan party Convergencia i Unio, who proposed a debate about the sustainability of the social security system. In the midst of a recession, the social security system was under pressure from a widespread use of early retirement, used by companies to lay off workers. The unexpected rise in retirees risked plunging the system into systemic deficit. Measures The package of measures involved both structural and management changes, including separation of contributary and non-contributary benefits, leaving the social security funding only contributory benefits while non-contributory benefits were to be financed from general taxation. A significant reform was the creation of a reserve fund, to be financed by surpluses of contributions over costs during periods of strong economic growth and to be used during periods of recession. The reform also involved a simplification of the numerous special conditions for different categories of workers and unified the contribution levels and ceilings. Changes were made to improve efficiency and fraud prevention, and an effort was made to encourage employment in labour- intensive industries as well as those requiring highly qualified employees, by reducing contributions. In addition, while maintaining the retirement age at 65 years, those wishing to carry on working beyond 65 would be encouraged by the social security system. Finally, a permanent parliamentary commission was created in order to monitor and modernise the pact and the system.

In 1992, it was also designated as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.ASME Landmark History 1935 photo The Old Mill is the only survivor of four windmills that were once located along the range of hills on the west side of Nantucket Island. It is a smock type windmill built in 1746 by Nathan Wilbur, a local sailor who had spent time in Holland. Wilbur used oaken beams that had washed ashore from wrecked ships for much of the mill's framework, which is held together by wooden pins and scrap metal. In 1828, the Old Mill was sold to Jared Gardner for twenty dollars. By then it was in deplorable condition. However, instead of dismantling it, Gardner, a carpenter, restored the mill to working condition capable of grinding corn. The mill was sold once again in 1866 to John Francis Sylvia, who operated it for many years with his assistant Peter Hoy until it fell into disuse in 1892. In 1897 Caroline French purchased the mill at an auction for $850 and donated it to the Nantucket Historical Association. The Old Mill is 50 feet high, with four vanes 30 feet in length. The interior mechanism has a driving wheel at the top, connected to the blades. It has a fixed body containing machinery and a cap that turns to face the sails into the wind. Projecting from the driving wheel are wooden cogs that intersect with another set of wooden teeth in a vertical shaft, which in turn revolves the upper grindstone. A crude brake consisting of heavy oak beam attached by a rope and pulley to a box of stone weighing several hundred pounds was built to counteract the force of the wind. The box of stone can be raised or lowered to press the beam against the windmill shaft.ASME Landmark brochure Inside, seasonal visitors can watch the gears as corn is ground into meal, producing about 5 bushels an hour.

Soon after its discovery, the bulk of the treasure disappeared, with only 8 silver statuettes and a silver plate identified as being part of the original find. All of these objects are now in the British Museum British Museum Collection Discovery In 1764, a large hoard of Roman silver was found in M√¢con, Burgundy. Early reports suggest that the treasure included over 30,000 gold and silver coins, a wide range of jewellery, five plates and a large number of silver figurines. Most of these objects disappeared, presumably to be melted down for the value of their bullion. Just eight statuettes and one silver plate remain from the original treasure. The statuettes were bequeathed by the museum trustee and philanthropist Richard Payne Knight, while the plate was acquired by the museum as part of the Duc de Blacas collection. Original Purpose The statuettes probably formed part of a public or domestic shrine or altar for local worship. A figure engraved in the central medallion of the dish shows a man pouring a libation at an altar. Based on the age of the latest coins found with the hoard (none of which date later than the Roman emperor Gallienus), archaeologists have estimated that the treasure originates from the second half of the 3rd Century, when this part of Gaul was facing insurrection during the Crisis of the Third Century. Description Four of the statuettes represent the Roman deity Mercury, who was widely worshipped in Roman Gaul. Other images of deities represented include the moon-goddess Luna, Genius and Jupiter, who is clasping a thunderbolt. Perhaps the most impressive item in the treasure is the small figure of a tutela, the goddess of chance or fortune. She is shown carrying in her hand a plate and busts of various divinities and between her wings are placed images of gods of the seven days of the week: Saturn, Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. The only other item associated with the treasure is a large circular dish made of silver.

The song, written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, concerns sharing memories with lost loved ones. The song was speculated to be inspired by the death of Barker's close friend and collaborator Adam Goldstein (DJ AM). The song received largely favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. The song, although not a single, peaked at number 33 on Billboard Rock Digital Songs chart in 2011.

Kerrang!. August 2011. p. 6 For his part, DeLonge neither confirmed nor denied the song's lyrical basis, on whether it was inspired by the death of DJ AM, although the song has been played live with a tribute video to AM playing in the background. He stated that his intentions in writing the song were to marry the notions of both beauty and angst with loss and heartache. \\"I think the point of a good song is that to different people, it strikes a chord for whatever reason, and I can only be responsible for half of it,\\" said DeLonge. \\"I can put it out there, but other people have to hear it and have it do something. That's all I do it for ‚Äì for that hope that it will do something.\\" Music The song is composed in the key of B major and is set in time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 206 beats per minute. DeLonge's vocal range spans from F#4 to E5. Drowned in Sound pointed out that the melody of the song's verses are \\"near- identical\\" to that of Box Car Racer's \\"There Is\\", a song by DeLonge's 2002 side project. The song has been described as \\"airy, uptempo rock,\\" and Spin considered the song as reminiscent of new wave.

The song was one of the first the band performed from Neighborhoods, alongside \\"After Midnight\\", \\"Heart's All Gone\\" and \\"Up All Night\\", and was debuted on the first night of the band's 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour, at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey. Spin described the performance as \\"sound[ing] so big you'd think there were twice as many musicians onstage.\\" The song received largely favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. BBC Music called the song \\"texturally delightful,\\" and Chad Grischow of IGN was positive in his assumptions of the song, writing, \\"The energetic, smattered beat and shimmering riffs of rapidly flailing 'Ghost on the Dance Floor' does a brilliant job expressing the conflicted feelings involved with having a deceased friend's memory come rushing back with a song.\\" Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk mentioned the song in a glowing review of Neighborhoods, noting that it sets the mood \\"fittingly\\" for what is an \\"absolute gem of an album.\\" Kyle Ryan of The A.V.

Slant Magazine's Jonathan Keefe was less impressed with the song: \\"The narrative is dictated more by its rhyme scheme than by a purposeful story.\\" He also criticized its production, noting that \\"The layering of sounds in Barker's percussion on [the song] is impressive, but the fact that his drumming is actually foregrounded in the mix both obscures the song's melody and detracts from whatever effect the band was trying to achieve with the heavy reverb on DeLonge's vocal track.\\" Chart positions= Weekly charts = { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2011) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Rock Digital Songs (Billboard)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 28 } Personnel ;Blink-182 *Tom DeLonge ‚Äì vocals, guitar, producer *Mark Hoppus ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar, producer * Travis Barker ‚Äì drums, producer ;Additional musicians *Roger Joseph Manning Jr. ‚Äì keyboards ;Production *Chris Holmes ‚Äì co-producer *\\"Critter\\" ‚Äì co-producer *Tom Lord- Alge ‚Äì mix engineer Notes Category:Blink-182 songs Category:2011 songs Category:Songs written by Mark Hoppus Category:Songs written by Tom DeLonge Category:Songs written by Travis Barker ","title":"Ghost on the Dance Floor"},{"id":"41519002","text":"Ernest Mangu is the Inspector General of Police of Tanzania.

Most devices are described as already operational and available to US nationals and members of the Five Eyes alliance. According to Der Spiegel, which released the catalog to the public on December 30, 2013, \\"The list reads like a mail-order catalog, one from which other NSA employees can order technologies from the ANT division for tapping their targets' data.\\" The document was created in 2008. Security researcher Jacob Appelbaum gave a speech at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg, Germany, in which he detailed techniques that the simultaneously published Der Spiegel article he coauthored indicate the NSA uses in its surveillance efforts in the US and internationally. The prices of the items in the catalog range from free (typically for software) to US$250,000. Background In 2013, Der Spiegel published an article, co- written by Jacob Appelbaum, Judith Horchert and Christian St√∂cker, that exposed the NSA \\"toolbox\\". Their source of the document was not disclosed. While it came from one of the news agencies in possession of documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, security expert Bruce Schneier said he doesn't \\"believe the TAO catalog came from the Snowden documents. I think there's a second leaker out there.\\" Exploits described in the document are mostly targeted at devices manufactured by US companies, including Apple, Cisco, Dell, Juniper Networks, Maxtor, Seagate, and Western Digital, although there is nothing in the document that suggests that the companies were complicit. After Der Spiegel revealed that NSA has the ability to inject software onto iPhones using an ANT product called DROPOUTJEEP, Apple issued a statement denying any prior knowledge of the NSA spyware and stated that they would take steps to protect their customers from security attacks \\"regardless of who's behind them\\". Cisco has mustered their Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) to investigate the hack vulnerability.

Originally a fulling mill, Bank Bottom Mill reached its heyday in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under the ownership of the Crowther family, in particular John Edward Crowther, a businessman and philanthropist. However, the cloth industry declined in the late twentieth century, and production of woollen cloth finally ceased in 2003. History=19th century= Bank Bottom Mill is a four storey structure which dates from 1824, and was originally a fulling mill. In the 1830s it was used by Norris, Sykes and Fisher. Later it was occupied by John Sykes and Sons.Teasdale, Vivien; Huddersfield Mills: A Textile Heritage, Wharncliffe Books (2004), p.162. . In 1834 Norris, Sykes and Fisher participated in the report of the Factories Commissioners into the Employment of Children in Factories, and as to the Propriety and Means of Curtailing their Labour. According to the answers given by the firm to the Commissioners, the firm had commenced manufacture of woollen cloth in 1824, using water power driven by the river Wessenden. They employed a number of children in the mill, some below ten years of age. Boys and girls under ten were paid 3 shillings a week, about half what an adult might receive, and were \\"employed in piecing for slubbers and mules, and feeding scribbling and carding machines\\". A regular working week for all workers was sixty nine and a half hours, with days off on Sunday, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and \\"about six other half days during the year\\". The firm was not enthusiastic about the prospect of legislation on the question of child labour: :\\"We are of the opinion that any legislative interference will prove prejudicial to both masters and workmen, more especially so where only water power is used. There exists no necessity whatever in the mills employed in manufacturing woollen cloths, and did we deem it needful to legislate on the subject, so difficult is the business, we should feel ourselves utterly at a loss how to act.\\" Factories Inquiry Commission Volume 2; Supplementary Report of the Central Board of Her Majesty's Commissioners Appointed to Collect Information in the Manufacturing, as to the Employment of Children in Factories, and as to the Propriety and Means of Curtailing their Labour (1834) Retrieved 4 January 2014 Crowthers In the late 19th century Bank Bottom Mill was taken over by Joseph, William and Elon Crowther. Their company, John Crowther and Sons, was named after their late father John Crowther, who was a woollen manufacturer from Golcar, West Yorkshire. By this time the mill was one of the largest cloth-producing mills owned by a single individual in the world. The floor space of the mill was 57,592 square yards, and contained forty three sets of carding machines and six hundred and eighty looms in production in the early part of the twentieth century.\\"The Crowthers Mill Owners Marsden\\" , Marsden History Group. Retrieved 31 December 2013 =20th century= Bank Bottom Mill in its heyday, c1923 John Edward Crowther At the start of the twentieth century, the smaller mills at Bank Bottom closed, gradually replaced by five bigger companies. These were: John Edward Crowther, New Mill (owned by Crowther Bruce and Co), Clough Lea Mill (owned by J. B. Robinson), Cellar‚Äôs Clough Mill (owned by Fisher, Firth & Co), and Holme Mills (owned by S, & C. Firth). Business boomed during the 1914-18 war, thanks to the huge demand for woollen cloth needed to clothe men in uniform. King George V and Queen Mary visited the mill on 30 May 1918, as a mark of appreciation of the contribution it was making to the continued war effort.Pearson, Irene E., p. .32, Marsden Through the Ages, (1984), Retrieved 4 January 2014 Conditions at Bank Bottom Mill were harsh by modern standards. Work began at 6.30am and a buzzer sounded, not just within the mill but across Marsden. If workers were not inside the mill by this time they would be locked out for the day, and no wages would be paid. Despite this, most workers were not in fact paid for the hours worked, but rather according to the amount of woollen cloth they produced, which had to be flawless.Pearson, p.32 However, in others ways the mill was quite progressive, opening Bank Bottom Dining Room in 1905 to provide good quality canteen food at low prices.Pearson, p.33 The business was run by John Edward Crowther, a businessman and philanthropist who made a number of charitable donations to the village and people of Marsden. In 1931 the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression caused the mill to work short time, and on 4 July 1931 Crowther took his own life.Pearson, p.43 =Decline and closure= By the late 20th and early 21st century the Yorkshire textile industry had fallen on hard times, and Bank Bottom Mill closed in 2003, with the loss of 275 jobs.\\"Bank Bottom Mill\\", Theviewfromthenorth.org.

He was the first of the Meade Baronets of Balintubber, and an ancestor of the Earls of Clanwilliam. He was unusual among the lawyers of his era for his lack of ambition to become a judge of the High Court, despite being widely regarded as a barrister of \\"excellent parts\\". In matters of religion he seems to have been, by the standards of his time, a man of very tolerant views: although he was himself a Protestant, he probably damaged his career by marrying Elizabeth Butler, who was a Roman Catholic, as his third wife. Early life He was born in Cork City, son of Colonel William Meade and Elizabeth Travers; he was a grandson of Sir John Meade senior, of Balintubber, and through his paternal grandmother, Catherine Sarsfield, a great-grandson of the notoriously corrupt judge Dominick Sarsfield, 1st Viscount Sarsfield. His mother Elizabeth Travers was the daughter of Sir Robert Travers (died 1647), Judge Advocate of Ireland and member of the Irish House of Commons for Clonakilty, who was killed at the Battle of Knocknanuss, and his second wife Elizabeth Boyle, daughter of Richard Boyle, Archbishop of Tuam. Meade was thus a close family connection of the \\"Great Earl of Cork\\", Richard Boyle. His younger sister Eleanor became the fourth wife of Godwin Swift, uncle and guardian of Jonathan Swift, and another sister, Joanna, is recorded as the grandmother of the writer Laetitia Pilkington. By his third marriage he also became a member of the great Butler dynasty, although this proved to be something of a mixed blessing, as he married into one of the Roman Catholic branches of the family. Career He became Attorney General to the Duke of York (the future King James II of England), and Chief Justice (Seneschal) of the Palatine court of Tipperary. The latter office was generally seen as a sinecure, although the fact that there was a second justice (sometimes called Master of the Rolls) of the Palatine Court suggests that the workload could was heavy enough. Meade was a fine lawyer, but he seems to have had little interest in becoming a High Court judge, perhaps because his real interest was in politics. He sat in the Irish House of Commons, first for Trinity College Dublin in the Patriot Parliament of 1689, and then for Tipperary for the rest of his life. Despite his willingness to sit in the Jacobite Patriot Parliament, he was regarded in his later years as a staunch supporter of William III of England. After the triumph of William's cause in 1690, he became King's Counsel,Hart p.71 and was spoken of as a likely candidate for the office of Third Irish Serjeant in 1692.Hart p.71 However, Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland objected to Meade's appointment, referring cryptically to \\"some exceptions (i.e. objections) against him\\".Hart p.71 This was almost certainly a reference to Meade's third wife, Elizabeth Butler, daughter of the second Viscount Ikerrin, who was a Roman Catholic; such a marriage, after the downfall of the Catholic King James II, was a serious obstacle to high office. Despite the handicap of his mixed marriage, Meade was offered the office of Serjeant, after Lord Romney and the rest of the Dublin Government became deeply dissatisfied with the behaviour of the Prime Serjeant, John Osborne, who frequently acted without instructions from the Government, and at times went directly contrary to official policy.Hart p.91 Meade refused the office on the ground that it would interfere with his flourishing private practiceHart p.91 (although Hart notes that contemporary serjeants like Sir Richard Stephens became extremely rich through the perquisites of the office).Stephens claimed that the office was worth ¬£1000 a year, a great fortune at the time, and this was probably only a slight exaggeration. Lord Romney made it clear that his objection to appointing Meade to office had been no reflection on his character or reputation. In contrast to the \\"treacherous and ungrateful\\" Osborne, Romney remarked that Meade \\"has done very well, and is a man of most excellent parts: all the exception that can be made against him is that his wife is a Papist.\\"Hart p.91 He was knighted in 1678 and made a baronet in 1703. He died in January 1707. Family Sir John married firstly Mary Coppinger, daughter of James Coppinger of Barryscourt Castle, County Cork; they had no children. Barryscourt Castle, home of Meade's first wife Mary Coppinger. He married secondly Elizabeth Redman, daughter and co-heiress of Colonel Daniel Redman of Ballylinch, County Kilkenny and his wife Abigail Otway. Redman was a Cromwellian army officer, who had purchased substantial lands in Ireland from his brother-in-law Captain John Joyner, who had begun his career as a cook in the household of King Charles I of England.

London p.471 John and Elizabeth had one surviving daughter- *Elizabeth, who married firstly Sir Ralph Freke, 1st Baronet, and secondly James King, 4th Baron Kingston and had children by both marriages. She died in 1750. He married thirdly in 1688 Elizabeth Butler, daughter of Pierce Butler, 2nd Viscount Ikerrin and his wife Eleanor Bryan. The 2nd Lord Ikerrin was a convert to Protestantism but his son James, the 3rd Viscount (who married Eleanor Redman, sister of John Meade's second wife Elizabeth Redman) reverted to the Catholic faith, as did Elizabeth herself. Her Catholic beliefs became a barrier to her husband's career advancement. She died in 1757.

History The main line of the Michigan Central Railroad, located about west of this site, was constructed through Cass County in 1848. Just after the Civil War, a new rail line known as the Michigan Air Line Railroad was constructed, linking Jackson with the Michigan Central line at Niles; two years later, the route was controlled by the Michigan Central. In 1919, a cutoff was constructed through Howard Township, linking the main Michigan Central line to the Airline. This bridge was constructed at the same time, probably from a design developed by the railroad company. The railroad beneath the bridge has been abandoned for many years and is overgrown. Description The Thomson Road‚ÄìAir Line Railroad Bridge is one of the oldest examples of a concrete T-beam bridge in Michigan, and the only historically significant bridge of the type having multiple spans. The entire bridge is long and just over in width, with five spans of in length. The length of the structure is due to the wide right-of-way beneath, which was used as a railroad switchyard known as the \\"Hump.\\" The bridge has an unusual brick deck, which has a slight arch.

The game was released on September 10, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux. The iOS port of Dropsy was released on December 17, 2015.  Gameplay  Dropsy is a point-and-click adventure centered on a clown named Dropsy. Players control Dropsy while exploring an open world in which they can interact with the environment, solve puzzles, and talk to non-player characters. In the game, Dropsy becomes an outcast after a fire at his family's circus and must work to discover the truth behind it in order to clear his name. The game contains no text, so dialogue is represented by visual icons. The game features over 50 minutes of live music composed and performed by Chris Schlarb.  Development  Dropsy began on the Something Awful forums in 2008 as a choose-your-own adventure game illustrated by Jay Tholen about a clown named Dropsy; forum commentators would suggest what the character would do and the choices would be illustrated and added to the story. The character originated from a platformer game created by Tholen in 2004. Demand for a playable version of the story increased and so Tholen began designing a game based around the story with the help of some members of the forum. Tholen cites games such as EarthBound, Grim Fandango, and The Neverhood as inspirations for the game. In 2011 a Kickstarter campaign raised $225 USD to fund a software package to help development, followed by another campaign in July 2013 which did not reach its $25,000 USD goal. A third campaign, started in October 2013, asked for $14,000 USD and finished with nearly $25,000 USD raised. On October 31, 2013, Tholen released a short horror-themed side game titled Dropsy and the Black Lodge. In November it was announced that Devolver Digital would be publishing the game, providing quality assurance and marketing, but not directing where the Kickstarter funds would be spent. On September 17, 2014, indie studio A Jolly Corpse joined the team. One year later on September 10, 2015, the game released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews.

This page covers the history and development of the various classes, and how they changed through their lives. H (1857) wooden box van Introduced as early as 1857, when the Victorian Railways took over the defunct Geelong and Melbourne railway company, the most common type of boxvan used by the Victorian Railways was known as the H van. From then to 1897 roughly 1,000 wagons were constructed. When an H van was not available or if the load was too tall to fit inside the wagon, the alternative was to obtain an open wagon and fit a tarpaulin over the top. Officially the class ranged from 1 through 966, but during the early years the Victorian Railways would regularly scrap a wagon and build a new one with the same number. The initial design was for a , four-wheel underframe with a body of about , rising to at the highest part of the roof. The capacity of the vans was up to or , whichever was reached first. Later designs were slightly different; most wagons had the same weight capacity, although length and height of wagons often changed; at least one wagon wasn't even fitted with a roof. From 1900 the vans started to be withdrawn from general service, instead shifting to maintenance or recovery work. A number were outfitted with tool kits and equipment, then used at locomotive depots. Otherwise, the H type vans were largely withdrawn as a class by 1909. The earlier vans had been replaced one-for-one with steel I-type open wagons; other wagons had been dedicated to maintenance or repair work. This was roughly when the \\"H\\" code stopped meaning box vans, instead becoming synonymous with departmental vehicles. In about 1915 a handful of wagons were fitted with platforms on the roofs, and used to form an overhead wiring train for contractors working on the Melbourne electrification project. After the project was completed the overhead train was retained for overhead maintenance work. A small number of vans had been fitted with replacement underframes by the 1970s. S (1880) bogie boxvan In 1880, twenty boxvans were built by Harkness & Co. for the Victorian Railways. The class given was S and numbers 1 through 20. The vans were for general traffic; tall, about across (wide) and just under over buffers for an internal capacity of . Each van had a single pair of doors in the centre. By 1886, S 16 was in use for milk transport. In 1889 a further two wagons, 18 and 20, were modified with the addition of shelving and steel bins, to allow for transport of of raspberries. No.11 is also marked as having increased capacity, but not listed under the raspberries section. In any case, it is thought that the raspberry wagons had returned to normal traffic - but maintained their increased capacity - by 1900. About half the class were written off the main register in 1891. These vans were recycled as \\"Casualty trucks\\", a predecessor to the later H van uses. In particular, vans 6, 11 and 13 are marked as being in use at Spencer St (now Southern Cross), Flinders St / Princes Bridge, and Ballarat. However even with this new use the vans did not last much longer, being replaced with conversions from the OO class of open wagons in 1912. All vans were scrapped by 1913. B (1957) steel boxvan As the H type wagons were withdrawn, more goods was transported by the alternative method of open wagons fitted with tarpaulins. However, by the mid 1950s this method had become unduly expensive, as tarpaulins were prone to regular damage from weather and improper staff handling practices, as well as simply wearing out. It was decided to recycle old steel underframes, using components from and a similar design to the then-new bogie boxvans, to create a new fleet of four- wheeled, all-steel boxvans. The first van entered service on 10 December 1957; the underframe had been recycled from open wagon I 15168, constructed in 1924. This van was slightly different from later releases, having flat sheet ends instead of the later pressed steel ridges, which were added for strength. The original order was made out for 500 wagons of the type; however between branch line closures due to traffic transferring to road (as result of ex-WWII vehicles becoming available to the general public) and the cost-cutting at the end of Operation Phoenix, the order was progressively cut back; first to 400 wagons, then to 350 wagons. However extra components were still available at the time of the final cutback, so the class eventually reached 380 members; the last delivered in 1961. The change of plan is clear when looking at the registers; the wagons from 1 to 350 recycled old I type underframes, while the majority of the 351-380 range had re-used underframes only a few years old, from the KF flat wagon class. The wagons had a capacity of , or . By the early 1980s, most were being scrapped with some in use as service vans for the Way and Works Branch. In later years bodies started to be placed at Train Examiner depots as work sheds. BH (S.A.R. M type) Boxvan (1925) In 1925 the Victorian Railways was paying close attention to W.A. Webb's transformation of the South Australian Railways, with the introduction of new locomotives and rolling stock and general upgrades across the board. One of the developments was the introduction of new, all-steel, larger bogie wagons for goods trains. These were of various types - boxvans, open wagons and so on. The VR took advantage of the opportunity to save on costs through economies of scale, and made a point of purchasing wagons identical to the SAR types. As a trial, around 1929 the VR hired a number of SAR wagons, including boxvans these were M 7005 and 7372. While on the VR system the wagons were temporarily recoded BHhttp://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/gid/slv-pic-aab64623Australian Model Railway Magazine, December 2018, p.27 It is possible that this code might have been perpetuated if further units had been purchased by the VR. By the early 1930s the two wagons had been returned to the SAR. BB, BA, TT Medium Bogie Timber Boxvan (1957) From late 1957, the last of the then-remaining TT insulated bogie vans were relettered to either BB for general use, or HH for breakdown train use. The fleet, previously with 31 vehicles, was renumbered from 1 to 21 to account for vehicles scrapped or otherwise converted since 1889. =BA reclassing= A further ten BB wagons were scrapped between 1959 and 1961, and the remaining vehicles reclassed to BA with the number group 1-5 and 7-12. It seems BA6 was intended to have been renumbered from BB15, but that vehicle was scrapped in December 1961, before it could receive the new identity. =Disposal= All wagons were scrapped by 1965, but the underframes of some were recycled - BA8, BA3 and BB2's frames became flat wagons HD230 for the fire attack train, and QD1 and QD2 for a construction train. A further three wagons were used to create HR bogie transports, for Y class locomotive bogie transfers during construction of the standard gauge from Wodonga to Melbourne. Medium Bogie Steel Boxvans=BB/BP era=BB/BP (1958) In 1958, designs were finalised for a new fleet of boxvans with pressed steel sides, resembling an extended version of the 1957 four-wheel B van type. The new wagons had four sliding doors fitted, one on each corner, and were constructed from 1958 to 1959. The first wagon built was number 22, following directly on from the older timber fleet. Wagons were constructed starting at BP22, running through to BP102. On the same day as BP102, BP3 entered service, followed by BP4 through BP21, the last to be delivered. At the time, BP1 and 2, of the older type, were still in service. The 100 wagons were built over about a year, and they entered service as either the BB or BP classes depending on the available bogies. BB wagons eventually included 22-29, 39, 41, 43-46, 49, 52 and 57-60. By late 1959 the entire fleet had been upgraded and reclassed as BP, except BB29 and BB45 which were altered in early 1960. BP98 spent some time in 1961-1963 on the standard gauge, painted in blue with gold stripes and fitted with a generator for head-end power provision. A video of the vehicle in service is available online, timestamp 2:31 to 2:44 - Following conversions to other classes, the BP fleet stabilised at eleven vehicles between 1968 and 1973: 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 20, 27, 54, 56, 64, 66 and 97. BB/BF22 (1959) The last wagon to be constructed was the second BB22, and it had a different door layout installed. Instead of doors on all four corners, this wagon had all four doors at one end of the body, with the other end sealed. This was a trial design allowing for loading from a shorter platform and carriage of wider loads, but the design required a deeper, stronger underframe at the door end to compensate for the extended body opening. This wagon was classed as the second BB22 (shortly after the classleader had been converted to BP). The design was later used for BLF/BLX and VLF/VLX wagons. The wagon was relettered BF22 in 1961, then became BMF1 a few months later. It was the only wagon in the series to never be classed BP. BB (1960) From 1960, a shortage of high-speed bogies saw a number of BP wagons downgraded back to BB. Wagons 77, 70, 10, 85, 14, 51, 71, 19, 9 and 67 were renumbered BB222 to 231. In 1961-62, these became BMF 2 through 11. BB (1963) A further need for high-speed bogies in 1963 saw wagons BP 37, 41, 47, 52, 65, 68, 73, 74, 81, 86, 89-92 and 96 downrated to BB, but they retained their numbers. BB73 was relettered as BMF73 fairly quickly, but the remainder were held to 1974. Then most returned to the BP classification with same numbers, while three were converted to BMX with new numbers (47 to 76, 65 to 77 and 86 to 78). =BMF/BMX/BP era (1961 to 1979)=BMF class Starting with BF22 to BMF1 in 1961, wagons began to be fitted with aligned bogies in 1961. This allowed operation at up to 60 miles per hour, against 50 mph for the diamond-frame bogies fitted to BB and 70 mph for the bogies fitted to the BP. The wagons fitted with aligned bogies were coded BMF, to indicate \\"medium\\" size distinct from the \\"long\\" wagons outlined below. BMF 2-11 were ex the 1960 batch of BB's, 222-231, all in 1961, and additional wagons were converted from BP between 1962 and 1965, with the final fleet being BMF 1-17, 21-38, 44-46, 48-49, 53, 58, 63, 72-73, 75, 98, 100 and 102. A total of 49 BMF wagons were in service by 1965. Of those, 20 had retained their original BP numbers, more or less at random. BMX class From 1965, instead of converting wagons to BMF, BB/BP wagons were instead upgraded to BMX. This code signified fitting of ride control and other features required for operation on the standard gauge network, and these wagons could have bogies switched fairly quickly between gauges. Most of the first 34 wagons were converted from BP between 1965 and 1968; in 1969 the remaining BMF series was absorbed into the BMX fleet. The final number series was 1-75, 98, 100 and 102, for a total of 78 class members. Disposal of the last BB's In 1974, the remaining 15 BB wagons were converted. Most had their passenger bogies returned, adding 37, 41, 52, 68, 74, 81, 89-92 and 96 to the fleet, for a total of 23 wagons. Three others, 76, 77 and 78, were converted to BMX. Return to BMF In 1978, BP4 was converted to BMX. Then, in 1978-79 about half of the BMX wagons were reclassed back to BMF and fitted with aligned bogies, making them non-suitable for bogie exchange. This was largely in response to the perception that gauge- convertible wagons were being borrowed for extensive periods by the New South Wales railways, and only being returned when due for maintenance. It may also have been done to account for the last dregs of the non-bogie stock being withdrawn. The wagons reclassed were 3, 7-9, 11, 18-19, 24-26, 28-30, 35, 38, 40, 43-44, 48-49, 52-53, 57-58, 60-61, 63, 66-67, 69, 72-73, 75-76 and 102. =1979 recoding= Between 1979 and 1981 the Victorian Railways fleet of bogie wagons was reclassed in line with the then-new Australian standards. All wagons kept their BMF/BMX/BP numbers. Generally speaking, BMF became VBAY, and BMX became VBAX, indicating Victorian, Boxvan, 1st variant and either fixed or gauge convertible, and BP became VBPY indicating Passenger use. Immediately after first recoding, there were 40 VBAX, 39 VBAY, 22 VBPY in service. VBAY52 switched to VBAX after a few months, during the middle of the process. A few other wagons were reclassed within the three VBxx codes over the next decade or so, but the fleet generally stayed the same size. In 1981 VBPY6 was reclassed to VBAY79, the next number available in the VBAY/VBAX series because the rampant renumbering up to 1965 had removed its original slot in the series. From late 1982 to early 1983, eight VBAY wagons (72, 7, 76, 44, 60, 22, 67, 30 and 43) were reclassed to VBPY 112-120 and added to the passenger fleet. In 1988 it was realised that the code \\"VBAY\\" was actually incorrect, and that the code should always have been VBAF. Wagons 15 and 63 were recoded, but none of the others because the vans in general were not required any more, so they were instead withdrawn and scrapped. During the scrapping process, a number of underframes from the surplus VBAY/VBAX wagons were modified to become VZTX sleeper transport wagons. It is not clear how many were used and when, because pencilled-in entries in the rolling stock registers overlap. It is known, for example, that the identities of VZTX 2, 3, 5 and 7 were each used at least twice. =D, DH, DN and DT Parcel Vans (1983-1986)= DT van trailing a V/Line service The two DN vans at Newport Workshops Three of the VBPY cars, 37, 56 and 90, were repainted into the teacup scheme, orange with two silver stripes. Shortly after, these and most of the rest of the VBPY fleet were reclassed as D parcels vans, and counted as part of the passenger fleet for accounting and rostering purposes. On reclassing, the wagons were repainted initially into the VicRail \\"teacup\\" scheme of orange with black underframe and two silver stripes; but no \\"teacup\\" logo was applied. From 1983 wagons were fitted with the new V/LINE logo on the body sides. At least one wagon, D329, was painted orange and black with white and green stripes, but no logo. Over the period 1983 to 1985, D vans 301 to 321 were converted from the VBPY fleet, except VPY6 which became VBAY79. These were quickly followed by D322-330 ex VBAX/VBAY wagons, and then VBPY112-120 were converted to D vans 331, 333-335, 337 and 339; though VBPY113, 117 and 119 became DH401, 402 and 403 instead. The slots D332, 336, 338 were never filled. D340 to D350 were converted from VBAY/VBAX, though shortly afterwards D350 (ex VBAY25) was converted to DH404. Finally, in 1986, the last serviceable VBAX wagons became D351-361. Notably, the majority of the D vans started on BX-type bogies; 351 onwards were fitted with Super Series bogies on conversion, and the previous units were upgraded at some point after November 1988.Newsrail November 1988 p344 The DH class were fitted with through cables for head-end power, so that P or N class locomotives could power the onboard airconditioning and lighting for carriages without having to shift the van to the far end of the train at each end of the trip. All the D vans were eventually fitted with the same Through-cabling, and had a letter T applied somewhere on their identity plates; in some cases this presents as part of the class, i.e. DT3xx or 3xxDT, other times the T is inserted between the class and number in superscript. Technically, the \\"T\\" is not a part of the wagon identity, just an instruction to staff. The first sighting of the DT code was DT331 on 22 August 1990, although D318 and D347 had also been reported as modified with through cables.Newsrail October 1990 p313 In late 1994 DH402 was scrapped at Bendigo Workshops, followed closely by DH401 in early 1995. The rest of the D fleet, and DH403 and 404, either passed to V/Line Passenger or was sold to West Coast Railway or one of the plethora of preservation groups operating at the time. Greaser Train (1995-1997) In 1995, vans D320 and D329 were handed over to the metropolitan division, and each fitted with screw couplers and buffers at one end to transition between Harris cars 794M and 797M, and Tait inspection car 1447M which had previously been sandwiched between two regular Tait motor cars. This was for the Greaser train, used for applying lubrication to the overhead wiring systems. When the Comeng and Hitachi fleet became the exclusive vehicles for the electrified network (following withdrawal of the Harris and electric locomotives), there was no longer a need to apply grease - the newer pantographs included a graphite contact strip which auto-lubricated the overhead. . These vans, among others, are now stored at Newport Workshops in Centre Block.Newsrail October 1997 p.323 West Coast Railway (1993-2003) A new rail operator, West Coast Railway, took over services on the Warrnambool route in 1993. They purchased a range of older locomotives and rollingstock from V/Line, including D vans 309, 314, 315, 318, 319, 325 and 333. The main difference between the West Coast fleet and others, aside from livery, was a large flat plate fitted over the ends between the two vertical beams.https://www.flickr.com/photos/60901191@N08/14253070531/in/album-72157626794063674/ Van 314 was marked DT 314 and 315 as DT 315, the latter with white on a blue number plate rather than the normal white on black.https://www.flickr.com/photos/60901191@N08/14253070531/in/album-72157626794063674/ DT319 was marked in the top-right corners, and had a door replaced with a different stair layout, at least for a time.https://www.flickr.com/photos/60901191@N08/11943265045/in/album-72157626794063674/https://www.flickr.com/photos/60901191@N08/14544762578/in/album-72157626794063674/ 314 and 315 are currently on the ground at Warrnambool, while 325 and 333 are privately owned in Neerim South.https://www.facebook.com/groups/VictorianRailwayEnthusiasts/permalink/1267840699918616/?comment_id=1267896359913050&reply;_comment_id=1268034063232613&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D V/Line Passenger (1995-current) In 1995 a new livery was introduced for V/line's Passenger operations. In lieu of the orange with white, green and grey, rollingstock was painted in all-over red with a black underframe and blue roof. This livery was applied to a handful of wagons retained by V/Line Passenger for use on their services; 302, 322, 324, 335 and 339.

Sometime after April 2000 vans DN403 and DN404 were transferred to Newport Workshops and stabled in the far- south-east corner, adjacent to North Williamstown station. After being stored there for nearly a decade, DN404 was removed from storage and rebuilt as power van PH454. The \\"V/LINE\\" logo was updated in 2000 to a flowing, italicised \\"V/Line\\", and the new logo was applied only to D335. In December 2010,vans 302, 324 and 335 were transferred to Newport Workshops for long-term storage. In 2015, van 339 was refurbished at Southern Shorthaul Railroad's Bendigo workshops, and it re-entered service in August that year. It and D322 are still used on occasion, but for the most part they are stored at Bank Sidings, just north of Southern Cross Station. Both vans are still in the post-1995 red livery with capital letters for the V/LINE logo. Other operators and preservation When V/Line was split into Passenger and Freight companies in 1995, some wagons went to each. When V/Line Freight was subsequently onsold to RailAmerica, that purchase included D vans 351-357 and 359-361, along with VZTX wagons 13-20. Otherwise, a handful of wagons were sold either into private ownership or to preservation organisations. When West Coast Railway wound up in 2004 the vans were distributed, and D319 spent time in private ownership. It was handed over to Seymour Rail Heritage Centre around 2007, painted in Victorian Railways blue and fitted with a generator set (similar to its predecessor BP98) for use on heritage trains radiating from Seymour. Its first run in the new scheme was the last run of the broad gauge Spirit of Progress from Melbourne to Albury, though it did not have the gold stripes applied as the repainting had only been completed the previous night. 707 Operations obtained D317, now in storage at Newport Workshops, and D318 which ended up with 707 Operations in a livery similar to the R Class locomotive tender. The Australian Railway Historical Society claimed D340, and this van was stored at the Newport paint shop with markings indicating its future. To date, it has not been placed on display in the museum due to a severe lack of space. Steamrail Victoria obtained D341. As of 2009 it was marked with large white crosses indicating that it was due to be scrapped in the Rotten Road purge in that year, undertaken to make way for additional Metro Trains Melbourne sidings. However the van was salvaged and is now the southernmost vehicle stabled on the new Rotten Road. Van BP97 was allocated to the South Gippsland Railway until 2016, and it is now allocated to the Yarra Valley Railway.https://www.facebook.com/YarraValleyRailway/photos/a.291974420901885.59883.291969427569051/1115703191862333/?type=3&comment;_id=1117184121714240&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D Large Bogie Steel Boxvans=BB/BF/BLF/BLX (1961), later VBBX/VBBY/VBBF= From late 1961, a fleet of large steel boxvans were built. The new vans were classed BB and numbered 23 to 118, directly following on from the ex-TT converts and BF22, the last vehicle in the Medium series. The new large vans were constructed very much like the soon-to-be-constructed VLF/X louvre vans, with curved roofs. The main difference was the pressed sheet-metal sides, rather than louvred sections. The vans were fitted with plain-bearing bogies. As roller-bearing bogies became available, the vans were reclassed as BF in 1961/62. The first was BF119 in October 1961, and wagons 35, 41, 45, 54, 57, 75, 85, 88, 93 and 105 were also converted and reclassed to suit. The class changed to BLF, with the L for 'Large', by early 1962. Vans released after BF 119 were all classed as BLF from the beginning. The final fleet was BLF 23 to 151, for a total of 129 vehicles. Between 1963 and 1965, the fleet was altered again with grade control and other equipment added to make them gauge- convertible, for use on the new standard gauge line to Sydney. The upgraded wagons were classed BLX, retaining same numbers. =BLF Cement wagons= In 1967, a small section of the fleet was separated out from the rest. 24 wagons, numbers 121 to 144, were reclassed back to BLF and used exclusively for palletised cement traffic from Fyansford to Melbourne and some country depots. All vans had stencils on the left end to indicate the restricted use, and the change from BLX to BLF was to ensure they did not end up back on the standard gauge system. =BLX Cheese wagon= Apparently, BLX120 was modified for cheese traffic, but details of the changes, if any, are not clear. =1979 recoding= In the 1979 recoding, the BLX wagons became VBBX, while the BLF cement wagons were relettered to VBBY, later VBBF. Wagon BLX113 was relettered as VBAX113 accidentally, and ran in service for a nearly a year until the error was corrected. The recoding took place in April 1979, and the incorrect code was still in place in late October. The class was placed into storage from 1990, with scrappings starting in 1991. The VBBF wagons stayed in service for perhaps another year. Many of the wagons were removed from service at Bendigo workshops, with the bodies sold to locals for private use. Many can still be seen on farms in country Victoria today. Preservation Van VBBX23 was allocated to the South Gippsland Railway until 2016; in 2017 it was reallocated to the Yarra Valley Railway.https://www.facebook.com/YarraValleyRailway/photos/a.291974420901885.59883.291969427569051/1115703191862333/?type=3&comment;_id=1117184121714240&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D Other preserved vehicles are VBBX 48, 59, 74 and 95.Bray, Vincent & Gregory, Preserved Rolling Stock of Victoria, 2013, , p.247 MS vans (1963) Despite the addition of the B vans to the goods fleet, bringing the total to around 24,000 vehicles, it seems the decision to cut back on the delivery of B vans may have been short-sighted. In 1963 it was decided to take a leaf from the book of the engineers from the 1930s, when a number of M cattle wagons were converted to MU-type louvre vans. This time around, 89 cattle wagons were converted, picked completely randomly. Numbers were retained with the code altered to MS, and the gaps between planks were covered with internal tarpaulins. The wagons were then used for bagged superphosphate (fertiliser) traffic, loaded and unloaded by hand. Three of the wagons had been converted back to M, replaced by other M to MS conversions in 1965. By 1970 the MS trucks were either being scrapped or returned to normal cattle traffic. The last to return to M was number 139, in mid-1971. BFW (1977) large bogie boxvan for car parts (later VBCW) In the mid 1970s there was a policy in place on the VR to eliminate as much as possible of the straggling four-wheel rolling stock then in use. One of the major traffics employing four-wheel wagons at the time was the shuttle service between Geelong and Campbellfield (Somerton), for the transfer of palletised car parts between the Ford plant in Geelong, and the car assembly plant just north of Upfield railway station. At the time, the four-wheeled wagons ran in block of up to 30 wagons at a time. Trains would run from Geelong to Newport then via Brooklyn to Sunshine, up to Broadmeadows via the Albion-Jacana freight line, and then shunt and reverse at what was then Somerton, now renamed Roxburgh Park station. Occasionally the train would not be able to get a direct schedule between Newport and Broadmeadows; on these occasions the train ran to either Melbourne Yard (or failing that, even Caulfield) to reverse before heading back. The replacement for the four-wheeled wagons, released in 1977, was the BFW boxvan. This new class of 40 wagons was massive by Victorian standards, with a length over coupler faces of more than and an internal capacity of . Eventually 40 members of the class were delivered; the train changed from 30-odd four-wheeled wagons to only ten boxvans, although the overall length was about the same. The vans were fitted with the same low-level aligned bogies as the FCW class of flat wagon (previously FCF); wagons within the W bogie class could be bogie- exchanged, but only within that group which indicated a low-level design to accommodate the taller loads. The lower underframe also necessitated gooseneck-type couplers, designed to lift the coupler head high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock. The horizontal center line of the coupler shank, or shaft, and of the draw gear are lower than that of the coupler head. In 1979 the class was recoded VBCW. The train stopped running in the late 1980s, as traffic shifted to road transport. Experiments were conducted in using the vans for general freight traffic, but even then there were too many vans available for not enough freight. By the mid 1990s the vans were in storage and by 1996 most had been cut for scrap with underframe sections salvaged to repair other stock. VBFX three-compartment van (1996) In 1996, louvre wagon VLEX949 was modified in Swan Hill by Grizzly Engineering. The sides were removed and two internal bulkheads were added, with the now three compartments made accessible with three pairs of external bi-folding doors. The new wagon, VBFX1, was painted into V/Line Freight colours. The new van was not used regularly, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat wagon VFTX 28. A second conversion by Grizzly Engineering (VBFX 2) was commenced but never completed. That wagon, previously VLEX1039, was used to create VFTX 39 by September 2000. Explosives transportation=Broad gauge (P vans)= Starting from 1855, a fleet of four-wheeled vans were designed for the transportation of explosive powders and compounds, as these were needed for construction and mining among other activities. With a wooden body and underframe and a capacity of each, the first five vans were constructed in iron by Joseph Wright & Sons at the Satley Works in Birmingham, England and delivered to Melbourne. The vans were created for the Geelong & Melbourne Railway.Independent research by Rick Eberle, seconded by Daryl Gregory The GMR had plans and documents outlining the vans' construction, and when delivered they were stencilled as \\"POWDER VAN No.1\\" through No.5.https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndrewCollierModellingHOVictorian/permalink/1821901824582043/ When the GMR wound up the five vans were transferred to the Victorian Railways, and the VR's rollingstock register erroneously records the wagons as being constructed in 1862 - the date of transfer from GMR to VR. The Victorian Railways classed the five as PV 1 to 5,http://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as913.gif and these were the only vehicles in the VR fleet available for explosives transportation until 1872-73 at which point more wagons were constructed by Rawlingshttp://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as915.gif in 1873. They were given numbers 6 to 11. A further expansionhttp://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as914.gif to the fleet came in 1882 when the Victorian Railways built van PV 12 at their own Williamstown Workshops. This design proved successful, as in 1884 another twelve wagons were constructed by Pickles & Co., with an identical design to PV 12 and built at the same location. These were the last vans to be built without Westinghouse brakes, and the entire fleet was modified in 1910-1912 to match the new safety standards, along with other modifications. While the original vans were classed PV, the fleet is referred to simply as the P class from 1886 onwards. In 1910, van P 10 had its underframe replaced with iron most likely as a trial. Then, from 1911 to 1921, vans 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 21 and 23 were scrapped, with parts recycled to construct new wagons with the same numbers and purpose at the Newport Workshops. The new wagons had Westinghouse brakes from the start, and it is probable that these vans resembled 12 through 23 although records do exist of another design.http://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as847.gif From 1900 and for about half a century after, explosives were also transported from Deer Park to Laverton; at Laverton the contents of the explosives vans were transferred by a -gauge tramway over to Trugannina Reserve for storage, then transportation to ships via smaller vessels. This complex procedure was necessary as explosive compounds were not allowed to come within a mile of Melbourne's main port. The first proper scrappings (without recycling) occurred in 1928, with another seven scrapped up to 1944. In 1948, wagons 1, 2, 3, 4 and 20 were stored at Tottenham Yard, with the entire remaining fleet save P 5 scrapped/recycled in 1953-54. P 5 was instead converted to van H 17 in 1950 (for departmental use) and by 1960 it had been sold to Yarragon. From 1954, a new fleethttp://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/au697.gif of P explosives wagons was constructed. These were very different from their predecessors in appearance, and were the first vans to break the trend of a limit, with capacity for or of explosive material. Like some of their predecessors, at least some wagons were constructed with recycled underframes and body frames, all metal, but with new plywood sides. The vans had automatic couplers and Westinghouse brakes from new, as was the standard at the time. Vans 1 through 25 were built in 1954-55, and the fleet was almost doubled in 1958-59 with the final van, P 45 (although it is thought that vans P 46 to P 51 were also constructed at this time, reliable records have not been found). The entire fleet was painted a bright red (different from the then-new Passenger Red) with a large yellow area declaring the explosive contents on all sides, and this made the wagons stand out in a train of brown wagons. Some wagons had their centre side-sills strengthened in the mid-1960s. In 1979-81 the surviving wagons had their load limits were altered from to in line with the metrification of the Victorian Railways, and around the same time signs were added relating to the allowed contents of the vans and safe handling of same. The fleet lasted intact through to the late mid-late 1970s, with scrappings, withdrawals and sales mostly occurring in the early 1980s although no records exist for about half the fleet. Today, vans P 8, 22 and 43 exist at the Victorian Goldfields Railway although only no.22 is operational. Also, the bodies of vans 5, 13 and 30 are used by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society for storage at Emerald, while up to five other vans may exist on private property at Ballarat, Bendigo, Leongatha, Yarraville and Williamstown. =Narrow gauge (NPH vans)= In 1910 the VR built 1NPH for the Walhalla line. 1NPH was built with 2 compartments for the carrying of Explosives and general goods and had an internal wall. However, by the time the Walhalla line was completed the Gold rush had mostly ended rendering 1NPH redundant. in the later half of 1910 1NPH was reclassed as 1NH, And in 1911 it was altered with the removal of the internal wall and replacement of the sold steel sheeted doors to the louvered doors. it then transferred to the Whitfield line where it remained until taken off Reg with the close of the line. It has since been rescued and fully restored to static condition. but could be made run able with a reconditioned set of bogies. Liveries In general, box vans have been painted in Victorian Railways Wagon Red livery. From the 1960s onwards this was amended with varying sizes of VR symbol on each side depending on the timeframe, generall larger logos earlier on.

It was directed, written and co-produced by Daniel Ribeiro, and stars Ghilherme Lobo, Fabio Audi, and Tess Amorim, reprising their roles from the short. The Way He Looks opened in the Panorama section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014. It was released to cinemas in Brazil on 10 April 2014. The film was met with positive reviews from critics and audiences; both groups praised Lobo, Audi, and Amorim's performances, Kerchove's cinematography, the soundtrack, and Ribeiro's direction. It ranked as the 5th most viewed film in the country on its first day of release. The film won two awards at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival; the FIPRESCI Prize for best feature film in the Panorama section and the Teddy Award for best LGBT-themed feature. It was selected as the Brazilian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Plot Leonardo, a blind high school student struggling with independence, and his best friend, Giovana, are discussing how they have yet to kiss anyone. Leonardo is especially distressed because he doesn't believe anyone wants to kiss him. Giovana regularly walks Leonardo home despite living in the opposite direction. At home, Leonardo's mother worries over leaving him home alone. Leonardo insists he will be fine, and his mother agrees under certain terms. At school, classmate, Fabio, bullies Leonardo for the sound of his typewriter. A new student named, Gabriel, arrives and takes the empty seat behind Leonardo. Giovana expresses romantic interest in Gabriel, but classmate Karina begins to pursue him. Leonardo and Giovana become friendlier with Gabriel and he joins the pair on their walks home. One day, Leonardo walks home from school alone and Fabio and his friends taunt Leo, causing him to trip and fall. When he arrives home late to his worried parents, he expresses his annoyance over their overprotective nature. Later on, Leonardo expresses to Giovana his interest in studying abroad as a way to leave his overbearing home life, but admits that he has not told his parents about his plans. At school, Leonardo and Gabriel pair up for a project. The two go for lunch and then a movie. Working on the project a few days later, Leonardo attempts to teach Gabriel braille, but he finds it impossible, Leonardo remarks that him riding a bike is impossible. The boys sneak out one night to watch a lunar eclipse. On the way home, Gabriel realizes he left his sweatshirt at Leonardo's house and asks him to bring it the next day. Later that night, Leonardo goes to bed with Gabriels sweatshirt on and masturbates. The exchange agency calls Leonardo about an American agency that specializes in blind students. The project results in Gabriel replacing Giovana as Leonardo's guide home, and she gets angry when they walk home without her one day. They wait for her the following day, but she ignores them. Leonardo finally confides his interest in going abroad to his parents and they outright disapprove. His father later addresses it privately with Leonardo, understanding Leonardo's interest, but is still not comfortable with it. The three friends go to a house party hosted by Karina. Giovana avoids Leo, still angry at him, and gets drunk with Gabriel, confessing that she feels he's replaced her in Leo's life and Leo wouldn't miss her if he went abroad. Giovana kisses him, but Gabriel does not reciprocate. While this is happening, Leo reluctantly joins a game of Spin the Bottle. When it lands on Leo, Fabio grabs Karina's dog for Leo to kiss. Giovana drags Leo out before anything happens, but does not tell him what Fabio was going to do. Leo is annoyed at her for what he believes is her interfering, furthering Giovana's anger at him before she leaves. Gabriel comes out after this, insisting that he take Leo home, but Leo expresses his angry at everyone controlling him and not even let him kiss anyone. Gabriel then kisses him and leaves quickly. The school goes on a camping trip and Leo sits alone on the bus, with Gabriel next to Karina. Gabriel approaches Leo at the campsite and claims that he was so drunk that he doesn't remember anything from Karina's party, including the kiss, which Leo doesn't discuss. Later on, while the class goes swimming at a pool, Gabriel helps Leo apply sunscreen, to which Fabio teases them about. Afterwards, Leo makes Gabriel wait with him at the pool while everybody gets cleaned up in the public showers, thinking that showering with other people is embarrassing. As they shower, Gabriel gazes at Leo's naked body and consequently becomes aroused. He quickly retreats to cover his erection with a towel and sits feeling embarrassed. That night, Giovana and Leo make up and get drunk together, with Leo eventually admitting that he is in love with Gabriel. Giovana is skeptical at first, but gives her support when they arrive home from the trip, urging Gabriel to go see Leo. Gabriel visits Leo at his house and when Leo asks if he hooked up with Karina, Gabriel admits she attempted to. However, he admits that he turned her down. Gabriel also confesses that it is Leo he is interested in and does remember their kiss after Karina's party. However, he has doubts about Leo reciprocating these feelings. Leo responds by kissing Gabriel. Some time later, the two present their project and walk home with Giovana, Leo on Gabriel's arm. Fabio and friends poke fun at the homosexual nature of Leo and Gabriel's relationship, not knowing the truth. Leo changes positions so he is holding hands with Gabriel, much to the shock and chagrin of Fabio's friends. The final scene of the film is Leo riding a bike with Gabriel perched on the back wheel, assisting him.

Reception=Box office= In its first week of release in Brazil, the film debuted in 33 screens, and was the fifth most watched film of the week, with an audience of 30,209 people.

Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying that \\"Ribeiro has impressively fleshed out the material into a full narrative, with not only added conflict and a convincing gallery of supporting characters but also an entirely new focus on the quest for independence of the blind lead.\\" Jay Weissber of the Variety remarked \\"Daniel Ribeiro's gay coming-of-age debut has an undeniable appeal... this is a gay story, done with tenderness and capturing the hesitancy of expressing affection when rejection can have ugly consequences.\\" Roger Walker-Dack writing for Queertiques.com, wrote \\"There is nothing at all extraordinary in the plot-lines of this wee movie, but somehow it has the most endearing quality that makes it so immensely enjoyable. There is a remarkable innocence to this group of young people who all seem never to have even been kissed, and even the inclusion of Leo's taunting by the bullies in his class has no hint of any real hatred. There are some really nice touches of humor and tenderness, none more so than when Gabriel insists that Leo learns how to dance. What does make it all so compelling is the captivating performances of the three young lead actors, particularly Ghilherme Lobo who was so pitch perfect as the blind boy.\\" The film also received generally positive reviews from the Brazilian press. Raisa Rossi of Almanaque Virtual gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Hard not to be moved by such a light and true story, which nullifies any kind of prejudice. The compelling interpretations, especially Ghilherme Lobo as a blind kid, nice and smooth picture soundtrack and right round the merits of the film.\\" On the Brazilian site Cineclick, reviewer Roberto Guerra cited the film as \\"Flawless and sensitive under various aspects.... Few films, national or international, treat sexual manifestation of a teenager with much refining and subtlety is in the whole and not only in the construction of the dramatic character arc. Soundtrack, cinematography, editing and supporting cast work in subtle harmony, but always vibrant.\\" =Accolades= Upon its premiere at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, The Way He Looks won the FIPRESCI Prize for best feature film in the Panorama section and the Teddy Award for best LGBT-themed feature. It also won the 2nd place award in the Panorama section.

This page covers the history and development of the various classes, and how they changed through their lives. T/TH vans For the transportation of milk, meat and other products that needed to be kept cold, in 1881 the Victorian Railways developed a small fleet of boxvans with a similar design to the H type boxvans. At least 19 were built by 1886, although records are incomplete. More wagons may have been constructed, but wagons which had been scrapped or converted by 1886 were not included in that year's register.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c217m.htm In 1887 four vans, numbers 6, 7, 8 and 16, were fitted with long bars inside the roof, for the purpose of hanging meat while being transported. Around the same time, a note in the rollingstock registers indicates that vans 14 and 15 were fitted with \\"side springs\\", although it is not known what this meant. With the introduction of the new, upgraded type of insulated T vans for 1894, these vans were recoded to TH. Most vans had been fitted only with a Westinghouse train pipe, not the full brake apparatus, between 1889 and 1892. The full brake equipment was not installed until the 1909-1910 period. From 1910 to 1923 the class was progressively withdrawn, with the last, TH 11, scrapped on 20 December 1923. TT vans As four-wheeled wagons were not always sufficient to handle the large amount of traffic needed, a fleet of bogie box vans with thick insulation was also developed. Initially, refrigeration was achieved by having slots in the sides and ends of the wagons, allowing airflow when the train was moving. This was the design used for the thirty-one TT class vans built between 1889 and 1891. The first wagon of this class had three single-doors per side and was used exclusively for milk traffic, while wagons 2 through 31 had two sets of double doors per side. The last of these, no.31, was modified in 1891 for fish traffic. All vans carried roughly of goods, and the code TT was probably selected as at the time there were a handful of T four-wheeled box vans fitted with meat-carrying facilities (see above under T/TH), and at the VR at the time used double-codes to indicate bogies. In 1939 vans 14 and 17 were damaged in a derailment. The bodies were scrapped, but the underframes were used on R 11, an overhead maintenance van, and Q 27, a Pintsch Gas transport wagon. In the late 1920s vans 15, 16 and 18 began use as Mail baggage vehicles with their capacity downrated to each. From 1941 they gained high-speed bogies for express train running, and in 1956 15 and 18 were recoded to TP, then to BP only a year later (TT 16 went on to become a BB van). That is why the steel vans BP above run from 3 to 102. The two vans were scrapped in November 1960. Between the mid-1930s and late 1950s, about half the remaining TT vans were recoded to BB, then BA classes for general goods, while the remainder went on to HH duty as breakdown or loco vans at places like Ararat, Benalla, Maryborough, Jolimont, Newport, North Melbourne and Traralgon. Vans 2, 3 and 12 also stand out; van 2 became a BB, then a crane crawler wagon QD, then a sleeper discharge wagon VZCA. Van 3 had a similar life, although it spent some time as a BA wagon between the BB and QD stages. Finally, van 12 became a BB, BA, then HD wagon despite that code normally being reserved for four-wheeled wagons, and finally it became VZAA, a fire attack wagon. T Vans Not long after the construction of the last TT van, a four-wheel van with a similar purpose was constructed. These were lettered T, and the wagons already existing and called T were relettered to TH to make way for the new class. The first vans were weighed , and were intended to have a mansard-style roof. However, this was altered to the constant-radius design before construction began. The vans were kept cool by their insulation, as well as a deep well suspended from the roof of the wagon, which was filled with salted, crushed ice at Melbourne Yard on a regular basis (What a Journey - Tom Yates). 191 vans were constructed of this type. The vans were painted in standard VR wagon red, but their roofs were in a lighter brown; this was probably to make them stand out in consists when being viewed from above. Wagons 20-34 utilised coconut fibres in the floor; 35-40 Luplan's carbo paint, and 41-48 zinc-white paint, all likely experiments attempting to improve the wagons' retention of cooler temperatures.https://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c080d.htm Starting from October 1909, the design was changed to a design with three axles, but otherwise construction was identical and continued up to wagon number 417 in 1924. Between 1929 and 1934, it is believed that vans 121-191 and 369-392 were converted to the TFM class; the differences being only two ice hatches placed closer to the ends of the wagons, and modifications to allow more meat to be held inside the wagons. In the mid-1930s, the wagon couplings were switched from hook-and-chain to autocoupler type. When these conversions took place, the six-wheeled vans lost their middle axles and TFM wagons were converted back to standard T design. By the 1950s the T vans were starting to wear out, so a new fleet of 50 aluminium-constructed vans were added, numbered 420 through 469. These had angled roofs and a capacity of , with room for up to of crush ice and walls thick, insulated with \\"Onazate\\". They were initially noticeable in consists because they not painted above the underframes (which were in VR wagon red), although by the mid-1960s they were painted all over in wagon red. Van 422 was of a different design to the other 49 wagons in this batch, with thinner walls and internal bracing to compensate; this could have been a trial or caused by material shortages. At some point, van 421 had its doors made wider for palletisation, although it is not known whether this was from new or a later modification. Other wagons of note are T 13 and 36 which were destroyed in a fire at the Government Cool Stores in 1937, T 6, which became wagon H1 for way and works fumigation in 1954, Ts 29, 167 and 181 which apparently swapped identities a few times, 20-34 with a coconut fibre floor, 35-40 with Luplan's Carbo Paint from new and 41-48 which were painted in Zinc White when new, T 103 which became a workmans' sleeper in 1957, Ts 140 and 143 which swapped identities in 1960, HD 217 and 222 which were converted to HD 238 and HD 239 respectively, T 304 which was converted to flat wagon K2 in 1978, HR 5 in 1980 and HZE 231 in 1985 and T 444 and 463 which had their floors modified for palletised butter traffic in February 1971. As the Victorian Railways lost its hold on the freight market the use of the vans declined, and by the mid-1970s many had been sold or scrapped with 79 underframes converted to KMQ flat wagons for container use. The class was essentially gone by the mid-1980s, with T 329 and T 378 the last to be marked Off Register in 1990. =TP vans= In 1958 two wagons, T 297 and 283, had passenger bogies added and were renumbered to TP 1 and 2, for express running from Melbourne to Mildura on the \\"fruity\\". In 1959, a further three wagons (393, 381 and 356) were converted to TP 3 through 5. At time of conversion, TPs 1, 2 and 3 had single-width doors added at each end of both sides, but TPs 4 and 5 retained only the centre doors provided on regular T vans. In the late 1970s the vans were fitted with \\"FOOD TRANSPORT ONLY\\" signs as health regulations required. The vans were intended to become the VRPY class in the 1979 recoding, but this never happened despite being indicted as such in the 1983 Working Time Table. Vans 1, 2 and 3 were out of service by 1983, and vans 4 and 5 followed the year after. Narrow Gauge In 1899 the Victorian Railways built a 1 off Narrow Gauge Insulated Van, 1NTT. It entered service painted white on the Gembrook Line, in 1905 it was repainted Red like other freight wagons of the period, with the opening of the extension of the Beech Forest line to Crowes it transferred to Colac for transporting meat from Crowes. In 1926 with VR goods rolling stock reclassification it was reclassed to 1NT. In the 1950s it ended its VR service career on the Whitfield Line. It is now stored at Puffing Billy awaiting a full restoration. Liveries When they first entered service, the iced wagon fleet was painted white with black text and underframe, and silver roofs. This helped to keep the wagons cool but it was difficult to keep them clean, so from around 1910 the livery changed to the standard wagon red (though the roof was painted in a tan scheme, to help identify iced wagon roof hatches from above). The five TP wagons fitted with passenger bogies were painted in Passenger Red.

This page covers the history and development of the various classes, and how they changed through their lives. General traffic - Fixed-wheel types=U vans (1897)= The U Vans were perhaps one of the most numerous wagons in service on the Victorian Railways. Built in a number of batches at Newport and Bendigo Workshops over a 61-year period extending from 1897 to 1958, the vans were initially intended as a replacement for the then-expiring H type vans. Because the vans were constructed over more sixty years, it follows that there were a number of different designs of vans constructed, as technology improved. Eventually the numbers for the class ranged from 1 through to 1976. U vans were used primarily for perishable traffic such as fish, fruit and chocolate, as the louvres along the sides and ends provided ventilation while the train was moving. In the mid 1920s, a lot of fruit was carried from the fruit growing areas to Melbourne for distribution and shipment. Other classes of goods could be carried if necessary. There was concern the vans were too hot in summer months; as a result, about 100 vans were built with double roofs in an attempt to provide some form of shade. By the 1970s, only a small handful of wagons with double roofs were still in service. Vans built over the 1888-1925 period were constructed with a single trap door installed in place of louvres at one end of the wagon, while later wagons were fitted with a trap door at each end. The trap doors were used for the insertion of long metal bars, which could be used for hanging meat. When wagons were going through regular maintenance in the 1960s, the trap doors were either welded shut or the entire end panel was replaced with a new section of only louvres. In the late 1950s the railways experimented by placing several sets of roller bearing axles under U vans. As more bogie rolling stock was being built it was decided that further fixed wheel tests were inappropriate; vans already fitted retained the roller bearings, but no new wagons were fitted. The vans were scrapped as more bogie louvre vans were built with numbers progressively scrapped towards the late 1970s. Many had bodies removed and sold with the underframes being converted to KAB and KMQ flat wagons. U van type 1 (1-277, 279, 280) These vans were wooden bodies on steel underframes. The wagons were built entirely as new stock; it is probable that the design was very similar to the then-common H van, other than the louvres designed to allow air flow through the wagon body. Wagons of this type measured over buffers with the axles at spacing, and were rated for load. A little under half the group, 1 through 112, were fitted with single roofs and single louvres; the remainder, 113-277, 279 and 280, were fitted with double-roofs as a form of shade, and double-louvres for strength. The second roof was slightly larger, overhanging the ends of the wagon body by about an inch on either end. Numbers 1-11 were built at Newport Workshops during 1888-1889. After the design was deemed a success, wagon U 12 was constructed as a pattern wagon, also at Newport Workshops; it was then forwarded to Bendigo so that the contractor, P. Ellis, could supply further wagons numbers 13-87. Following this order, it was decided to return construction to Newport Workshops. Wagons 88 and 89 were delivered at the end of 1893, followed by 90 through 112 in 1894. A diagram from 1904 notes that wagons 54 and 86-89 were fitted with 5\\" diameter Knowles Ventilators (2 each except 88 which had 3), probably to aid cooling. Additionally, wagons 94-96 and 98 were specially modified to carry fish.Newsrail November 1991 p371 The next order placed with Newport Workshops was for wagons 113-127. These wagons were identical in design to the previous series; after 113 and 114, the wagons returned to the single roof and louvres type. About a year after the delivery of U 112, number 113 emerged from Newport Workshops on 19 March 1895. Wagons were constructed in intervals of a handful at a time, with gaps of months or years between deliveries, with the final wagon (U 125) emerging on 25 July 1895; deliveries were not in order of construction. Wagons 121 and 122 are noted in a 1904 rollingstock diagram as having battened floors for carrying fish. Wagons U 128 through U 202 were constructed by the Braybrook Imperial Co., and U 203 to U 277 by Robinson & Co in Spottiswoode. 279 and 280 were built and delivered by Newport Workshops, with the group completed by December 1897. Wagons of this group are noted in rollingstock registers as spending anywhere from a week to two months at Newport Workshops around 1932-1934; this is around the time the wagons were fitted with automatic couplers. By the 1950s, the bodies, which had always required a high level of maintenance, were deteriorating badly. As a result, 1953/54 saw 25 supply their underframes for use under P explosives vans (see below), which were then being constructed. Further P vans were built on the underframes of other wooden U vans, whose bodies had been condemned, during 1958/59. Forty two of the remaining \\"Robinson Pattern\\" U vans were recoded HD during 1957/58, for use as Way and Works Plant Trucks. They lasted in this capacity into the 1970s, with steady attrition from 1971 to 1980. U van type 2 (278, 281-460) (all-steel construction) This series was much like the previous, except that the entire wagon was now constructed with steel, rather than having a wooden body on a steel underframe. Dimensions were identical to previous; over buffers, between axles, 10t load (total 281), single roof and louvres. This series of wagons was built with a through air pipe, but not air brakes. Those were retrofitted over time, after a decision as to the design of brake had been made. U 278 was built at Newport Workshops as the prototype, and was released to service on 22 March 1897. Then, over the course of about six weeks from 7 June 1898, wagons U 281 to U 310 were released. The next batch was U 311 to U 460, released over about seven months from 24 June 1899. Finally, wagons U 461 through U 560 entered service in 1906. The last batch is said to have had a different handbrake arrangement, although details of the differences are not clear. Notable wagons within this batch, other than the class leader, are 432, which was marked as having \\"loose shelves to form a second floor\\", and U 471, which for unknown reasons had a maximum capacity of instead of the normal . During the conversion to automatic couplers, the vans had their buffers removed and the wagon capacity was increased from . U van type 3 (561-991) (long body, three axles when new) This batch was effectively a whole new class, although included in the U series because the purpose of the vans was the same. The new type was nearly twice the length of previous U vans, measuring over buffers. To support the extra weight, the vans were fitted with three axles, spaced apart. The maximum load was . However, the door size was maintained at , which later caused problems with loading/unloading the extra goods. The vans were fitted with a wheel-type handbrake, and the top louvre on the end was fitted with a single trap door to allow insertion/removal of meat- hanging bars. The roof was still a single layer of plain steel panels. The first 30 wagons, U 561 to U 590, were built at Newport Workshops in 1908. Following that, 120 wagons were delivered in 1912-1913 (up to U 711), and another 280 wagons up to 1919, fairly evenly spaced - although there were no wagons built during 1918, a result of World War I as well as the need to focus on providing rolling stock and equipment for the suburban electrification project. The final wagon of the type, U 991, was delivered on 13 June 1919. These wagons were heavily modified around 1932-1934, with the middle axle removed and the other two modified with larger axle boxes, creating the ubiquitous underframe (in fact between axles, not over ends). This change occurred with the introduction of automatic couplers; as part of the same project, when buffers were removed the wagons were upgraded to a maximum load of instead of the previous . Of the 430 wagons of the type, about 390 were upgraded as such; the remainder had bogies added, and were re classed UB. A number of these vans were later retrofitted with long side doors; it is thought that this occurred around 1950. The most unusual U van of the entire fleet is thought to be U 961, which had its body replaced in 1963 with an all- new design. The sides of the van were VLX components, fitted with B van sliding doors; the ends were a custom-made part. This was done as an experiment for a new type of explosives van. U van type 4 (992-1066) (corrugated iron roof) In an attempt to further experiment with internal cooling of the perishable loads, a new batch of U vans was delivered in 1925. While the design was mostly identical to the previous batch (including the trap doors and six-wheel design), the new series of 75 vans was built with a corrugated iron roof in lieu of the previous steel plate design. Additionally, the vans had a wide side door, instead of a wide door, to make for faster loading and unloading. These wider doors were partially flat near the base. The entire series was delivered in 1925. The same modifications were made in the 1932-34 period as the previous batch, with around 20 wagons from this group being converted to UB bogie wagons. U van type 5 (1067-1216) (second trap door) Identical to the type 4 series in most ways, the only design change at this point was the addition of a second trap door for meat bars, at the opposite end of the wagon. Wagons U 1067-1116 were built at Newport over three months from November 1934; wagons U 1117-1217 were built at Bendigo workshops from February 1936 to December 1938. Notably, U 1141 through U 1217 were constructed with two axles instead of three, and autocouplers, the Westinghouse automatic brake system and increased load of 16 tons were part of the wagons from new. U van type 6 (1217-1466) (lever handbrake) The final development of the long U type van design, the only change made over the type 5's was the replacement of the wheel handbrake for a lever type. All of these wagons were constructed, from new, with two axles spaced apart, autocouplers and the Westinghouse air brake system. Wagons U 1217-1266 were built at Bendigo over about six months from December 1938; 1267 was built at Newport in the middle of 1946, followed by 1268-1366 in 1947. 1367-1466 were built at Newport over nine months from September 1951. U van type 7 (1467-1796) (rebuilds) As mentioned above, by the 1960s the original, short U vans were becoming maintenance-intensive, particularly those with wooden bodies. However, at the time there were not enough bogie wagons on the Victorian Railways to justify scrapping of the fleet, so instead the underframes were recycled and rebuilt with new bodies at Bendigo workshops. Of the 460 short wagons originally built (179 timber body, 281 all-steel), 254 had their bodies replaced with the new type, along with 76 underframes donated from scrapped open wagons of the IA type. Wagons U 1467-1545 entered service in 1956; 1546-1663 in 1957; 1664-1782 in 1958 and 1783-1796 in 1959. While the bodies were replaced, the underframes were left mostly untouched; they were still over pulling lines, between axles and a maximum load. The new bodies were similar in design to the early VF bogie vans; they all had sliding doors (based on the B type vans) and corrugated iron roofing. The ends of the bodies had a few varieties in detail, with later wagons fitted with an additional cross-beam near the top of the end pieces for extra strength. Additionally, later wagons had a door based on the VF wagons. UB van, later VLAA When the six-wheel louvre vans were being converted to four-wheel in 1932-1934, the opportunity was taken to convert 50, later 60 vans to bogies instead of fixed-axle. The new vans were fitted with a coupler pocket capable of being fitted with either autocouplers or transition hooks, though the latter was far more common. The vans were initially fitted with diamond-frame bogies, which were displaced from open QR wagons; at the time these were being upgraded to the barframe type. It is thought that the UB project may have been conceived as a method to use up the leftover bogies, more than as an attempt to increase capacity or speed of the service. UB vans were regularly used behind railmotors on lightly-used branch lines, in the spirit of the old \\"mixed\\" train service. Depending on the line gradients, a railmotor may have been able to haul up to three wagons. Around the 1940s, some UBs were fitted with an upgraded, all-welded type of bogie more suited to passenger train speeds. Also, for use behind railmotors and passenger trains, the vans were fitted with taildiscs and side brackets for lamps. These fittings were never removed, and could be seen on UB vans as late as the 1970s. From 1955, the railways introduced a code system to identify vehicle speeds, in conjunction with the New South Wales Railways in planning for the new standard gauge link from Melbourne to Albury. As part of the project, it was intended that some goods trains could be marshalled exclusively with higher-speed rollingstock. In the late 1960s/early 1970s some wagons had the bottom three louvres in the doors replaced with flat steel sheets.http://www.steameramodels.com/documents/UB%20Van.pdf The UB vehicles in passenger traffic were coded _UP_, the \\"P\\" denoting passenger speed. With the reduction of UP traffic in the early 1960s, the vans were recoded back to UB. In the early 1960s, some UB vans were fitted with fast freight bogies and recoded to _UF_. The last UB in service, UB 56 was recoded to VLAA 56 in 1981. Documents indicated the code for UB would be 'VLLA', but this was a typing mistake. The van was out of service by 1984. In 1992 it was sighted at Spotswood Workshops, held for preservation; it is now stored in Newport East Block with markings indicating that it is being held for the Australian Railway Historical Society. UF van Four UB vans were recoded to UF during 1961. They were placed on cast bogies capable of higher speeds, a result of internal springing that reduced vibrations. The four vans were 15, 17, 53 and 55. UF 15 was converted from, then back to a UB in November 1961. The same month conversion appears to be an error; perhaps too many vehicles were converted, or it was found that not as many were required. In the late 1970s the three remaining UF vans were running on the early morning 'paper' trains that transferred metropolitan newspapers to regional centres. The vans were scrapped during 1978/79. The body of UF 17 was at Moama until Feb 1996. UP van In 1955, the UB vans fitted with passenger type bogies were given the code \\"UP\\". These were vans that had been fitted with high speed bogies in the 1930s and 1940s for use on fast trains and behind railmotors. The new bogie type was the \\"TT 30\\", intended to improve the ride quality of the vans for use on passenger trains. The UP van numbers were 14, 28, 32, 33, 42, 46, 48, 53 and 60. It is thought that UP 19 also ran; UB 19 is mentioned as being fitted with \\"pass\\" (passenger) bogies in 1956, though the records do not show the code UP. Vans recoded were fitted side lamp brackets and tail discs at each end. The vans were recoded back to UB between 1958-1961, but kept the additional fittings; the recode was a result of new VP vans entering service in large numbers. Advertising on vans From 1925, some of the vans earned extra revenue by being painted with company advertising, effectively becoming billboards on wheels.

It appears that during the 1930s conversion project from screw couplers to automatic couplers resulted in a short-term lack of louvre and box vans; to fill the gap, fifty M cattle wagons were converted from 1932 during their own conversion to autocouplers, with wooden planks and louvres used to cover the gaps over the normal cattle wagon design. The wagons were restored to their M wagon type and identity by 1934. The wagons were used primarily for fruit traffic. The MU wagons were taken from the M wagons between 323 and 418. =V type louvre van (1925)=Original vans Following the experiments with the S.A.R. M type vans, it was decided to purchase a pair of wagons from the American Car & Foundry, USA, for further testing. These two were similar in design to S.A.R. wagons, except with a louvre design rather than a plain boxcar design. The two vans were delivered as kits in 1925 and assembled at Newport Workshops, becoming vans V1 and V2. As the tests proved successful, the VR constructed a further 80 wagons over the period 1927-1929. These vans were of a similar design, but with a corrugated roof placed on in lieu of the sheet steel design, to better suit Australian conditions. Vans numbered 51 and above were fitted with twin doors per side at one-third in from the ends of the wagons, rather than a single central door. VP (1954) louvre van - 70mph From 1954 to 1956 the V group was expanded with a further 50 wagons, numbered 100 through 149 (leaving a gap of 83-99). The new vans were issued as either V or VP, depending on the type of bogies fitted. Eventually, as the vans received newer bogies, the 100-149 group was reclassed to VP to indicate their higher maximum speed and the purpose of running on passenger trains for baggage, parcels and mail transport. In 1974, VP 103 was partially destroyed in a fire. During the rebuild process the van was fitted with a VSX-style roof, because those were in production at Ballarat Workshops at the time. In the mid-1970s it was common for most country passenger trains to run with a VP van, usually at the Melbourne end of the consist. This meant that half the time the VP van would be trailing the guard's van; to facilitate this, VP vans were equipped with a taildisc and lamp brackets. As an example of regular broad-gauge trains in the North-Eastern district:Victorian Railways Working Time-Table for the North-Eastern District, dated Sunday 25 November 1973, page 157 Melbourne-bound services *7:15am UP Albury (No.8 Express Monday‚ÄìSaturday; No.10 Express Sunday), 1 van behind locomotive Tuesday & Friday or 3 vans behind locomotive Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. *3:25pm (4:30pm Saturdays) UP Albury (No.18 Passenger) to Melbourne, 1 van behind locomotive Tuesday to Saturday. Outbound services * 8:35am DOWN Albury (No.5 Express), 1 van at lead of the Albury portion, Tuesday-Saturday. Train was a combined Albury and Tocumwal service, splitting at Seymour; it included a guards van behind the VP but the rear of the Albury portion was an MBS buffet car. * 4:45pm DOWN Albury (No.15 Express or No.15-Altered Express if Friday-exclusive optional No.9 running), 1 van at rear weekdays but to be detached at Wodonga on Fridays; 2 additional vans behind locomotive on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, to be detached at Wodonga (5 minutes allowed). * 5:02pm DOWN Albury (No.9 Passenger Conditional), 1 van, detach at Benalla (4 minutes allowed). Train only ran on Fridays and only if required; when running the schedule for the 4:45pm was altered to terminate at Wodonga at 9:10pm instead of Albury at 9:55pm. (The 4:45pm train arrived Albury at 9:20pm on Monday‚ÄìThursday). Note that even assuming the Wodonga drop-offs are delivered to Albury later, the above causes an imbalance; each week, two more vans are running towards Melbourne than away from Melbourne, not counting the odd Benalla drop-off from No.9. These imbalances would have been resolved by attaching extra vans to freight trains, and there were daily scheduled transfers between Wodonga and Albury yards - two on weekdays, one on weekends. VF (1961) louvre van - 60mph In the early 1960s the original V type vans 1-81 were fitted with upgraded bogies and recoded to VF, allowing running at up to (V 82 had been scrapped in 1960). These upgrades were completed with the intention of allowing faster travel times, as well as to provide more stock for the standard gauge working to Sydney. The VF series of wagons ran in general traffic, although a small number were specifically allocated to newspaper trains. Standard Gauge operations from 1962 In 1963 confusion among staff was becoming a problem, with regards to which wagons were gauge-exchangeable and which were not. In response to this the code letter \\"X\\" was introduced to indicate vehicles so suited. Plans were made to apply this to the VF class (i.e. as VX), although the program was cancelled while the first, VF 29, was still in the workshops being prepared. However, a group of about 20 VP vans were placed permanently on the standard gauge for trains running between Melbourne and Sydney, usually attached to trains like the Spirit of Progress and the Intercapital Daylight. For example, in 1973 it was expected that the VP van was to trail the locomotive on the Melbourne 8:40pm departure of the Intercapital Daylight, all days except Sunday and Monday.Victorian Railways Working Time-Table for the North-Eastern District, dated Sunday 25 November 1973, page 49 This group is known to have included 100, 104, 107, 108, 110-112, 126-127, 130, 134, 137, 140-141 and 146.Bray & Vincent, Bogie Freight Wagons of Victoria 1979 to 1999, 2006, , p.120 Vans that had, at some point, operated on the standard gauge were fitted with black number boards and white text on those; other vans had the information simply painted onto the body. 1979 Recoding When the 1979 recoding rolled around, the VF class were recoded to VLBY and the VP class became VLPY. By this time not many of the former VF vans were left; only about ten of the freight wagons actually made the jump, due to a combination of age and that many newer designs were available. The recoded wagons were s 2, 14 and 44 of the one-door type, and 54, 65, 66, 69, 72 and 81 of the two- door type. Of those, VLBY 2, 69, 72 and 81 had all been withdrawn from service within a year of their respective recodes. VF 17 may have been recoded, but records are unclear.Bray & Vincent, Bogie Freight Wagons of Victoria 1979 to 1999, 2006, , p.106-108http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c112d.htm All the VP vehicles were recoded to VLPY, numbers 100-149. 1981 New Deal In 1981 with the New Deal, passenger trains started to use former boxvans in lieu of louvre vans which swapped bogies with the VLPY fleet. As a result, between 1982-1983 the VLPY fleet was gradually recoded to VLBY. Forty of the fifty total vans were converted. Of the remainder, three - 139, 140 and 142 - were instead used to build the three original PH power vans in 1984, two - 100 and 126 - were instead recoded to VLPF (retaining their bogies), and five were taken off-register while still as VLPY: 111, 129, 130, 134 and 136. VLPY111's body was sold to a property on Wedge St in Epping. 1988 Recode In 1988 the railways realised that the letter \\"Y\\" was incorrect and should have been \\"F\\" in the codes - i.e. VxxY should have been VxxF. By this time most of the VLBY fleet had been withdrawn, but the last five in service - 109-110, 121, 127 and 145 - were recoded from VLBY to VLBF. Vans VLPF 100 and 126 were photographed at North Melbourne in 1990, then reported as seen in Spotswood yards, stored, in 1996. Disposal By 1991 most of the VLBY vans were out of service and stored; over the next few years most of the class were either scrapped or sold as bodies. In preservation Today, fourteen vans of the V design still exist. VLBF 6 is the only one of the VF range and it is currently with the Australian Railway Historical Society; the remainder are ex-VP vans, numbers 100, 103, 105, 108, 109, 114, 122, 125, 129, 132, 133, 135 and 138. 1960s bogie louvre van types By the early 1960s the V series of bogie louvre vans were beginning to wear out, with the original series being around 35 years old; and the 50 new members were being used mainly on passenger trains. However, with the continuing increase of traffic (particularly on the new standard gauge line), a need was created for a new, standard type of bogie louvre van. =VLF (1962) & VLX (1964) - Medium Bogie Louvre Van= The need for more capacity resulted in the new class of VLF wagons, with the first member, VLF 1, released to service on 25 May 1962. The class became known as \\"medium\\" because of the handful of \\"small\\" bogie louvre vans still in service and classed UB/UF/UP. The interior was designed for two rows of ten square pallets, an indication that the Victorian Railways was keeping in mind developing trends, as pallets are still used today for stock movements. The current Australian Standard timber pallet, S1165A, is square, deep.http://www.chep.com/pallets/pallet_sizes/ The vans were also limited to maximum capacity. The sides of the wagon were limited internally to tall. There was more room in the centre, but the door heights would have been an issue.http://www.victorianrailways.net/freight/freight%20pics/vlxdias/vlxdia.html The first hundred-or-so wagons released, numbered between 1-87 and 99-135, entered service as VLF, indicating that whatever gauge they were on, they had to stay on. Wagons 88 through 98 were released as VLX, indicating that they could change gauges as needed by replacing the bogies. VLF 135 entered service in mid-1964. Vans 1, 2 and 28-76 had been built at Newport Workshops, while the remainder - 3-27 and 77-135 - were constructed at Bendigo Workshops. However, this quickly proved insufficient for traffic requirements, so more wagons were constructed from March 1965, and the existing VLF wagons were all reclassed to VLX. By 1967 the class had reached 660 members, with about half done at Newport and the remainder split between Ballarat and Bendigo workshops. Because of the large numbers, the VLX class quickly became the Victorian Railways' primary bogie louvre van, on both broad and standard gauges. The vans were regularly seen all over the country, on standard gauge trains as far-flung as Brisbane and Perth. This was clearly intentional, as the diagram for the VLX design notes that the type measurements conform to the Queensland Railways' narrow gauge dimensions. VLX 467 was fitted with a 'Miner' wheel handbrake as a trial. Otherwise, handbrakes on this class were 'ratchet' type. =VHX (1963) - Large Bogie Louvre Van= This small group of 20 wagons was constructed over the period 1963 to 1965. The design is basically a stretched version of the VLX louvre van, with many similar concepts. The interior was expanded from 20 to 26 standard pallets. The vans were also limited to maximum capacity. The sides of the wagon were limited internally to tall. There was more room in the centre, but the door heights would have been an issue.http://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/as489.gif Strangely, the diagram indicates a flat underframe, but in practice the wagons were built with a fish-belly design. The VHX vans when built were painted all-over brown; the roofs were resprayed on some wagons to silver around 1978, with the intent of reflecting more heat and keeping the inside of the wagon cooler. =VSX (1972), VSF (1978) - Large Bogie Louvre Van= Based on the previous VHX design, between 1972 and 1976 a further 250 vans were built. The vans were slightly different from the VHX type, with additional strengthening 'ribs' added between the louvre groups on the sides. The new vans were classed VSX and numbered 801 to 1050. The van design featured the Miner type handbrake, corrugated sliding doors over the centre single opening of the van, and a red- painted body with silver roof. The vans were decorated with a large <\\\\--VR--> logo. While in interstate service, three vans were destroyed in derailments; VSX 809 in Ubonia, Western Australia and VSX 930 at Port Augusta, South Australia in 1978, and VSX 834 at Zanthus, Western Australia in 1979. Around 1978 seven wagons, 1036-1045 were reclassed to VSF to trap those into the new Freight Centre service. =1979 recodes= When the Railways of Australia recoding system came into place, the VLX, VHX and VSX/F series of wagons were recoded to a similar theme. The VLX wagons became VLCX; the VHX became VLDX and the VSX/F became VLEX/Y, indicating the wagon types' heritage. The first two changes were fairly straightforward; however, at the same time as the recode, the VLEY code was boosted to about 120 wagons, using wagons that otherwise would have been converted from VSX to VLEX. The choice of \\"C\\" as the first in the new codes was due to VLA- being taken by the bogie U vans, and VLB- being taken by the V/VF/VP bogie louvre van series dating from 1925. =1980s= During the late 1980s, some VLCX vans were cut down to flatwagons and modified as VZSX sleeper transports. In 1988 any vans coded VL-Y had the Y replaced with an F, to fix an error in the original recoding scheme. VLNX (1981) Newsprint vans In 1981, 25 VLEX/Y vans were converted to VLNX, exclusively for Newsprint traffic. =1990s= From about 1990 some louvred doors were replaced with flat doors, perhaps as a result of a lack of spare parts. By 1991 about one hundred VLCX vans were surplus to requirements and placed into storage. Around the same time, at least eight VLEX's were stencilled for \\"PAPER TRAFFIC ONLY DYNON - DRY CREEK\\". In 1993, three VLEX vans were destroyed in a derailment in Western Australia. In lieu of repayment, V/line requested three comparable vans in exchange. The three replacement VLEX vans: 873, 874 and 989 arrived in Victoria July 1993, repainted and reclassed from Western Australian WBAX boxvans. National Rail Corporation Recodes For NRC use, the VLCX vans were recoded to RLCX, and about 70 VLEX vans were recoded RLEX. The wagons were returned to V/Line in late 1996 / early 1997, converted back to their previous codes and stored. VLVX (1994) Intrastate-only vans In 1994, when the VLCX wagons were being recoded to RLCX, twenty wagons were retained by V/Line and coded VLVX for use within Victoria, between Melbourne and various freight centres. The number group was 1 - 20, although the wagons were selected at random from the VLCX group.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c089d.htm VBFX (1996) During 1996, VLEX 949 was heavily modified to become VBFX 1. Another conversion from VLEX 1039 was started, but not completed. VBFX 1 was later converted to VFTX 28. The conversion was enacted by Grizzly Engineering of Swan Hill during 1996. The modifications included the removal of the fixed side louvre panels and doors, the fitting of two internal bulkheads, 3 pairs of external bi- folding doors and repainting into V/Line Freight colours. VFBX 1 saw very little use, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat-wagon VFTX 28. A second conversion by Grizzly Engineering (VBFX 2) was commenced but never completed. The underframe of VLEX 1039 became flat-wagon VFTX 39 by September 2000. =2000s= As of 2001, 61 vans were still registered in the RAMS (Railways of Australia Monitoring System). During 2003, at least 28 VLEX's were repainted into Freight Australia colours and recoded to VLRX for rice traffic. To retain some VLCX vans for intrastate use, V/line recoded some vans to VLVX for parcels traffic use. By 1996, most of the early numbered vans had been scrapped. Underframes were being used to replace older underframes under tank wagons. Underframe conversions: VFWY (1983), VZLY (1985), VZZF (1993), VFTX (timber traffic, 2000) In April 1983 the underframe of VLEX 817 was converted to VFWY 1, a flat wagon with fittings for transferring diesel engine blocks; by 1985 the wagon had been reclassed to VZLY 80.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c490m.htm In March 1993, two further underframes were taken and converted to VZZF, for transfer of bogie frames (without the wheels).http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c542m.htm VZZF 1 came from the frame of VLEX 845; VZZF 2 came from VLEX 942. These wagons were converted with the intention of transporting standard gauge bogies from the Goninan workshops in Bendigo, and North Melbourne goods yard, where wagons were transferred between gauges. In 1997 one of the VZZF vans was seen in storage at the Bendigo Workshops; it was fitted with 18 wooden floor bolsters spaced evenly along the floor. These bolsters appeared to extend over the side of the wagon sides. In 2000, 41 surplus VLEX vans had their bodies removed, and the underframes were converted to carry sawn pine logs and recoded VFTX.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/cvftxm.htm Narrow Gauge Just like the broad gauge railways, the narrow gauge lines required covered vans. The vast majority of those were louvre vans. Hearse vans (C/J vans) In 1893 the Victorian Railways decided that new wagons were required for the transportation of corpses, as the existing arrangements were unsatisfactory. To fill the need as quickly as possible, two mail vans (E 1 & E 2) and a carriage truck (G 24) were converted to hearse vans C 1, 2 and 3, each long with 20 separate 1'7\\"-wide compartments over two levels. The trio, when not running to Springvale or Fawkner cemeteries, were kept in the Mortuary Dock off Batman Avenue at Flinders Street Station; this siding was accessible from what is now known as Platform 13. Between 1902 and 1903 another six vans, numbered 4 to 9 were constructed. The new vans were also four-wheelers, about long with room for fourteen corpses on two levels. The design was somewhat unusual in that the outer twelve slots had a single door, but the centre slot on each level had two half-width doors. The compartments ranged in size, with the four outermost slots 2'3¬Ω\\" wide, the two centre slots 3'1\\" wide and the other eight slots only 2'3\\" wide. Also in 1903, vans C 2 and C 3 was scrapped, although a new C 3 was converted from Mail Van E 3 in 1906. Vans C 1 and C 3 (the second) were scrapped in 1909. In the 1910 recoding the remaining vans, C 4 through C 9, were renumbered to J 1 through J 6 in the same order. However, by 1912 their underframes were wearing out and capacity requirements were changing, so the six vans were lifted from their underframes, and the bodies were cut and merged to give four new six-wheeled wagons of about 26 feet long, each capable of conveying up to 20 corpses at a time. Vans J 4 & 5 created J 7, J 2 became J 8, J 1 & 3 gave J 9 and J 6 became J 10. It is likely that either the new J 8 and J 10 were extended with newly built components, or that they used leftover parts from the other conversions. Overall, the fleet capacity was reduced by a total of four compartments. When electrification onto the Springvale Cemetery line and past Fawkner cemetery rolled around in the early 1920s, the four vans were provided with through cables to allow them to be included between a Swing Door M and D set. A daily electric visitors and mortuary train ran to Fawkner until 1939, and a conditional mortuary train to Springvale Cemetery until 1943. Until the end, the vans were averaging around per year, which equates to 100 trips per year on the round journey. The vans hung around for about six years following the cancellation of corpse trains, until they were finally withdrawn in 1949; at this time the electric through- cabling gear was removed, and the vans were scrapped or sold in 1953. In 1990, the Fawkner Cemetery restored a J van using a van body found at Romsey and an underframe purchased from the railways. The van was restored to cosmetic accuracy and numbered 7, although the body number was never known. The van now sits adjacent to Platform 2 at Fawkner station. Liveries In general, louvre vans have been painted in Victorian Railways Wagon Red livery. From the 1960s onwards this was amended with varying sizes of VR symbol on each side depending on the timeframe.

He qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1895. He served as a civil surgeon with the South African Field Force in 1901 during the Second Boer War, before settling in Weymouth. There he was appointed surgeon to the Princess Christian Hospital for Women and Children. Sanderson-Wells proceeded to study for his Bachelor of Medicine degree in London. During the First World War, Sanderson-Wells served as an officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, also working in Gaza with the Red Cross. He was elected into the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1918. He was awarded an MBE in 1920 in recognition for his services in connection with work at military hospitals in the United Kingdom during the war. Sanderon-Wells subsequently continued to work at Weymouth District Hospital until an old injury (his leg was badly burnt during experimental x-ray research early in his career) forced him to retire in 1925 from practising surgery. He was made an honorary consulting surgeon at the hospital and went on to become its vice-president. Two prizes to his memory have been established at the University of London, both of which recognise Sanderson- Wells' work in nutrition. He married Agnes Laurie in 1906 and she died in 1950.

It was written and directed by A. J. Edwards and produced by Terrence Malick. The film had its premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2014. It was subsequently screened in the Panorama program at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on February 8, 2014. In March 2014, Amplify acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released on November 7, 2014. Synopsis and background This film serves as a story of Abraham Lincoln's childhood, his upbringing in Indiana, and the hardships and tragedies that made him the man he was. Lincoln lived more than thirteen years in Indiana, but the film focuses on his life from ages eight to eleven or twelve (years 1817 to 1821), and explores Lincoln's relationships between Lincoln and his birth mother and his stepmother. Lincoln historian and scholar William Bartelt served as a historical consultant for the film with Bartelt's book There I Grew Up providing substantial inspiration to the filmmakers. The title of the film, \\"The Better Angels,\\" is borrowed from the final words of Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address, \\"the better angels of our nature.\\" Cast * Diane Kruger as Sarah Lincoln * Jason Clarke as Thomas Lincoln * Brit Marling as Nancy Lincoln * Wes Bentley as Mr. Crawford * Braydon Denney as Abe (Young Abraham Lincoln) *Cameron Mitchell Williams as Dennis Hanks Reception The Better Angels received mixed reviews from critics. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying it's \\"a beautiful, arty, very Malick-influenced evocation of Abraham Lincoln's childhood.\\" Katie Hasty of HitFix praised the film by saying it is \\"a lushly conceived, exhaustively realized debut feature that'd be pretty formidable stuff coming from a more practised filmmaker ‚Äî and derided in some quarters as a self-impressed knock-off.\\" Rodrigo Perez in his Indiewire review said the movie focuses \\"on mood, nature, divinity and celestial atmosphere\\" rather than story. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 45%, based on reviews from 49 critics with an average score of 5.88/10.The website's critics' consensus reads: \\"Malick-inspired but not as inspired as Malick, The Better Angels muffles an interesting idea under ponderous execution.\\" See also *Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln ReferencesExternal links  The Better Angels Category:2014 films Category:2014 biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Biographical films about Abraham Lincoln Category:Films set in 1817 Category:Films set in 1818 Category:Films set in 1819 Category:Films set in 1820 Category:Films set in 1821 Category:Films set in Indiana Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:2014 drama films ","title":"The Better Angels (film)"},{"id":"41519775","text":"The Real Story was an American current affairs television program hosted by journalist Gretchen Carlson on the Fox News Channel.

They were formed in 1889 and played their first competitive match in October of that year, when they entered the First Qualifying Round of the FA Cup. Since then more than 1,000 players have made a competitive first-team appearance for the club, of whom a large number have made between 25 and 99 appearances (including substitute appearances); those players are listed here. Overview of the list Since the club's formation in 1889 over 300 players have made between 25 and 99 appearances for the club. Throughout the club's history no player has played 99 competitive gamed for the Blades without going on to make a 100th appearance. The closest to achieving this feat are the six players that played 98 times prior to leaving the club; they being Peter Beagrie, Alonzo Drake, Colin Grainger, Tom Heffernan, Bobby Howitt, and Mark Todd. Midfielder Stefan Scougall was the most recent player to reach the 25 appearance mark for Sheffield United in October 2014, and of the current United squad, eight players (Jose Baxter, Ben Davies, Bob Harris, Mark Howard, George Long, Stephen McGinn, Jamie Murphy, and Stefan Scougall) feature on this list but therefore have the opportunity to add more appearances to their total. A number of players on this list had more than one spell with United, but only Jon Harley signed for the Blades on three separate occasions (twice on loan and once on a permanent contract), becoming one of only two players to achieve this feat in the club's history. There are also a number of players on this list whose entire time with United was spent on loan; Mark Bunn, Conor Coady, Greg Halford, and Nyron Nosworthy.

History The organization was formed during 1992 as a result of a meeting convened by Bishop (now Archbishop) J. Delano Ellis.Website of United Covenant Churches of Christ. The meeting was held at Cleveland, Ohio on May 29th 1992. Bishop Ellis was appointed general overseer and president on August 22nd 1992.

Source: www.loveexpressonline.com/ericgarnes.html Distinguishing characteristics A notable characteristic of the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ is that they have sought to combine Pentecostal Holiness teaching and practice with an ecclesiology and theology that is at once evangelical, pentecostal, sacramental, ceremonial and celebratory. There are similarities with the Convergence Movement and with aspects of the independent sacramental movement. A specific and notable feature of the approach adopted by United Pentecostal Churches of Christ has been a desire to honor the ancient apostolic succession through the laying-on of a bishop's hands during ordination.

It was probably dedicated to Dionysus or Athena and is one of the three temples on the East Hill. The temple's dating is very uncertain, but it probably belongs to the middle of the sixth century BC The temple has six columns at the front and fourteen on the sides and represented a development of the very elongated archaic temple to a more balanced form which was becoming the norm on the Greek mainland as well,Dieter Mertens, Citt√† e monumenti dei greci d'Occidente, 2006,, pp.227-228 and foreshadowing the 2:1 intercolumniation ratio between the long and short sides. The colonnade contained a wider pteron than usual in temples built in Sicily and, as a result, a rather narrow naos with an adyton at the rear and a pronaos with four columns. Except for those in the facade, the columns lack entasis. The intercolumniation of the peristasis was closed with high masonry barriers.Dieter Mertens, op. cit., 2006, pp.227-228 The barriers are about half the height of the columns and were perhaps built in a second phase of construction, perhaps in order to transform the peristasis into a cultic area.Enzo Lippolis, Monica Livadiotti, Giorgio Rocco, Architettura greca: storia e monumenti del mondo della polis dalle origini al V secolo, 2007, , p.835 In 1823, during excavations, two half metopes carved in tufa were discovered, depicting Dionysus and Athena respectively.

Europe=Vampires and other undead= The idea that the vampire \\"can only be slain with a stake driven through its heart\\" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's Dracula and the more recent Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Twilight series' all incorporate that idea. In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, among several, to \\"kill\\" a vampire, or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment. In one story, an Istrian peasant named Jure Grando died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was decapitated, and the vampire terror was put to rest. Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Romanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a vrykolakas. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite describes an odd grave found at Mytilene, at Lesbos, a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition. The Norse draugr, or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/tumuli. The approved methods of killing a draugr are \\"to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes\\". Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. Edward Payson Evans tells the following story, from the city Kada≈à: =Literary treatment of impalement= A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in Ivo Andriƒá's novel The Bridge on the Drina.Excerpt of impalement in Andriƒá was later awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the magnum opus.On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see =Anecdotes of the impaled= Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to Saint Barbara. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky. All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to de-impale himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest. Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a \\"Ladies' Journal\\", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in Arad when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there. Americas In British Columbia, a folk tale from the Lillooet People is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. Among tribes living around the Titicaca, tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the Incas, a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events. Martyrdom of al-Hallaj The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as \\"I am God\\". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance \\"I am God\\" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like \\"I am God\\". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last. Orientalism Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. Dimitrie Cantemir, a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he does, however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case. In 1632, under Murad IV (r.1623‚Äì40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship. Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it. Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under Mustafa II: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine. Indian sub-continent In the Hindu Draupadi cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re- enactments during holidays/festivals. According to a Shaivite story from India, under the old Pandyan Dynasty, ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King Koon Pandiyan had 8000 Jains impaled in Madurai. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains. This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in \\"lurid mural representations\\" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu. An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of Meenakshi. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name Chennai), for example, the walls \\"are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey.\\" This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King Pushyamitra Shunga, as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text Ashokavadana. In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the Pala Empire, Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the Wise Men of Gotham, bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter. The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the Arthashastra states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire \\"by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled\\". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible: The ascetic Mandavya, when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord Yama, the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as Vidura, the son of a mere serving maid.Combined from two slightly variant accounts, and A tale from Kashmir of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: \\"To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom\\". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with Yoginis (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and \\"lustful for a man\\", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and \\"spent the rest of the night sporting with him\\". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as Aryaraja, and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy. Eastern Asia In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as John Bowring relates from Siam, those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again ... Another tale popular in Siam was about Devadatta, a wily antagonist to Buddha seeking to undermine Gautama's position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the Avici, being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in Cambodia, see Illusions of impalement The 1980 Italian film, Cannibal Holocaust, directed by Ruggero Deodato, graphically depicts impalement. The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the Amazon Rainforest. The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned. The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the \\"impaled\\" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the special effect was done: the actress sat on a bicycle seat mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of balsa wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped. In stage magic, the illusion of impalement is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.See, for example: Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some dervish orders performed such acts already in the 18th century.

Alexander & Sons Leyland Tiger bus with Alexander bodywork W. Alexander & Sons Ltd was a bus operator and coachbuilder in Scotland. The company grew from small beginnings to become the largest bus operator in Scotland, and one of the largest in the U.K., by the time it was split up in 1961.McCallum & Bloomfield (1965), p. 7. Its coachbuilding activities, which were transferred to a separate company in 1947, still survive as part of Alexander Dennis.  History  Alexanders' Motor Services began running 'omnibus' services in the Falkirk area from a base in Camelon in 1913, and by 1924 the company was registered as W. Alexander & Sons Ltd.McCallum & Bloomfield (1965), pp. 4-7. It was run by father and son, Walter Alexander (1879‚Äì1959) and Walter Alexander (1902‚Äì1979). From 1929 the company was controlled by the Scottish Motor Traction Company (SMT),McCallum & Bloomfield (1965), p. 4. which had itself come under control of the LMS and LNE Railway companies the previous year.McCallum & Bloomfield (1965), p. 74. Expansion was rapid, partly achieved by acquisition. An early gain was the Scottish General Omnibus Group, which, through a northern subsidiary, took the growing Alexanders empire as far away as Aberdeen and Inverness by 1930. In 1934 another notable achievement was an agreement with Perth Corporation to run city bus services on their behalf.. Some acquired companies were initially operated as subsidiaries rather than being immediately absorbed by Alexander, notably General Motor Carrying Co. Ltd. of Kirkcaldy (1930-37)P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 4., Simpson's and Forrester's Ltd. of Dunfermline (1929-38)P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 4., Pitlochry Motor Services Ltd. of Pitlochry (1929-42)P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 6. and David Lawson Ltd. of Kirkintilloch (1936-61).P.S.V. Circle (1995), p. 6. In addition to running services, Alexanders had also been building bus bodies since 1924, initially for their own use and then for their subsidiary operators and other members of the SMT group. However, when the bus and coach operations of the SMT group were about to be nationalisedHibbs (1968), p211. following the new Labour Government's Transport Act 1947,Hibbs (1968), p206. it became necessary to move the coachbuilding to a separate company, Walter Alexander & Co. (Coachbuilders) Ltd, in order to keep it in private hands. Nationalisation of the railway companies in 1948 made the British Transport Commission majority owner of the SMT group, and complete nationalisation took place in 1949. Some minor restructuring of the companies then took place, with the SMT parent company's detached operations in the Dundee area being transferred to Alexander later that year. In 1952 Highland Omnibuses Ltd. was formed by the merger of the group's Inverness-based subsidiaries Highland Transport and MacRae & Dick, and Alexander's Inverness operations were also transferred to the new company. The geographical extent of the company's services was huge, extending from Glasgow and Oban in the south west to Aberdeen and Forres in the north-east, so for management purposes there where three operating areas - Fife (within the county of Fife, which prior to the construction of the Forth and Tay road bridges had a relatively self-contained bus network), Southern (south and west of Perth) and Northern (Dundee and the north east). In 1961 the operating company was split into three smaller units corresponding with these areas, W. Alexander & Sons (Fife) Ltd. based in Kirkcaldy, W. Alexander & Sons (Midland) Ltd. based in Falkirk and W. Alexander & Sons (Northern) Ltd. based in Aberdeen. Alexander (Midland) also absorbed the David Lawson subsidiary at this time. The old company's buses had used a blue livery, apart from Perth City and Kirkcaldy Town buses and the David Lawson subsidiary, which fleets were usually painted dark red. Soon after the split, however, the Fife and Northern companies adopted bright red and yellow liveries respectively, while the Midland company retained the original shade of blue. The Alexander fleetname was not used on vehicles thereafter, although the bluebird logo used on Alexander's coach fleet continued to be used by all three successor companies. As part of a rebranding exercise within the Scottish Transport Group in 1978, fleet names Fife Scottish, Midland Scottish and Northern Scottish were adopted. In preparation for deregulation of bus services, a further reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group occurred in 1985 in which boundaries were realigned again and the three companies became five: Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., Midland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., Northern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. and Strathtay Scottish Omnibuses Ltd.

History=Nursing journals= Under the influence of Florence Nightingale, nursing became a scientific field of study and an independent discipline in healthcare. On March 6, 1886, the first nursing journal, The Nightingale was published, becoming the first nursing journal. In 1900, the American Journal of Nursing began publication, becoming the first nursing journal to be owned and operated by nurses. It remains the oldest nursing journal still in circulation. In 1952, the first journal dedicated to nursing research, Nursing Research was published. As the profession grew, new journals began to be published, including journals dedicated to various nursing specialties. Nursing journals remain a primary method in which the nursing community shares information and disseminates research findings. These journals are most often peer-reviewed and contain editorials and reports of original research, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and qualitative research. Some journals also include case reports and case studies. With the advent of evidence-based nursing, the number of journals blossomed. Most journal articles are indexed in National Library of Medicine's PubMed database as well as various other databases, including CINAHL. =Nursing texts= Nightingale wrote extensively during her years as a nurse. Her most important work was Notes on Nursing in which she provided instructions for caregivers, including nurses, on how to provide care to the wounded and sick, as well as health promotion topics. Although not officially a textbook for nursing, it is considered the first scientific writing about nursing care. The first scholarly textbook for nursing is generally accepted as Text-Book of the Principles and Practice of Nursing by Bertha Harmer, a Canadian nurse and early nurse educator. Virginia Henderson is regarded as one of the earliest nurse educators to expand the scholarly writings of nursing into textbooks for use in schools and colleges of nursing.

It was named the fourth most popular song in a poll conducted by the BBC World Service worldwide in 2002.  Recording  The song sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Swarnalatha was featured in the 1991 film Thalapathi, which was known to be the last collaboration of Mani Ratnam and Ilaiyaraja, the former's regular composer until then. It was recorded in Bombay and was among the first to be recorded for the film. On the insistence of Mani Ratnam, Vaali had \\"blended\\" the original lines with Tevaram, a ≈öaiva devotional poetry.  Music video  The song was shot in Raya Gopuram, Melukote over several days during the night. It was picturised on Rajinikanth and Sonu Walia dancing along with other dancers.

According to Mani Ratnam, it was one of the \\"big-scale\\" songs of Sivan in the latter's early career. Set in the backdrop of a temple, the song's pulse changes when Shobana arrives with a group of women possessing oil-lamps, passing the dancers and floating those lamps on a pond.

Preface The castle is a 14th- or 15th-century tower house; extended in the 16th and 17th centuries and converted into a house. Hayton Castle is a simple rectangular house, with windows from three periods ‚Äì 15th Century, Elizabethan and Georgian. There are very thick walls, and there's a barrel vault in the basement ‚Äì indicating a fortified house. During the 17th century it was occupied by a branch of the Musgrave family. It was officially listed as a Grade I building on 11 April 1967. History Hayton Castle is the centre of a small manor within the baroncy of Allerdale, whose families have featured prominently in the history of Cumberland. The manor of Hayton was originally granted by Alan, second Lord of Allerdale, to his huntsman Seliff, whose descendants in consequence assumed the name De Hayton. From the Hayton's, this manor passed by a succession of female heirs to Robert de Mulcaster, through his marriage to an heiress of the powerful Lucy family. William de Mulcaster, son of Robert, was High Sheriff of Cumberland for two periods between 1298 and 1306, and various members of that family appear to have been Knights of the shire of Cumberland during the 14th century. This line possessed the manor for five generations, but through the failure of the male issue it passed to Piers Jeffrey Tilliol, by his marriage to the heiress. Piers had two daughters Isabella and Margaret. Isabella, who received Hayton, married John Colville of Torpenhow. Colville died in 1438 and his line came to an end in 1479, once more with two daughters, who both married younger sons of Sir Thomas Musgrave (1417‚Äì1469) of Hartley Castle. It was from this marriage of Margaret Colville and Nicholas Musgrave (1450‚Äì1506), fourth son of Sir Thomas, that sprang the line through which the manor was handed down for fourteen generations, lasting about 300 years. He was succeeded by Thomas Musgrave, Marshal of Berwick (1483‚Äì1532). His son William Musgrave, MP, of Hayton (1518‚Äì1597) inherited the estate. He was succeeded by Sir Edward Musgrave, MP (1561‚Äì1641). His son William (1596‚Äì1634) was the next to inherit the estate, followed by his son Edward. Sir Edward Musgrave, 1st Baronet of Hayton Castle (1621‚Äì1676) was made a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1638. He was succeeded by his son Sir Richard Musgrave, 2nd Baronet (1650‚Äì1710). Upon his death the estate fell to his son and heir, Sir Richard Musgrave, 3rd Baronet (1675‚Äì1711). He was a Member of Parliament for the Cumberland constituency in 1701 and 1702‚Äì1708. After his death the estate passed to Sir Richard Musgrave 4th Baronet (170‚Äì1739). Sir Richard Musgrave 5th Baronet (1724‚Äì1755), took the name of Hylton, pursuant to the will of his uncle, John Hylton of Hilton Castle, and dying without issue, the title went to his brother, Sir William Musgrave 6th Baronet (1735‚Äì1800), a commissioner of the customs.Rose, pp. 133-134. After William's death the title went to his younger brother Sir Thomas Musgrave 7th Baronet (1737‚Äì1812), a general in the British Army. Thomas was succeeded by a distant cousin, Sir James Musgrave, 8th Baronet of Barnsley Park, Gloucestershire. Sir James Musgrave died in 1814, and was succeeded by his son, Sir James Musgrave, 9th Baronet (1785‚Äì1858). The manor of Hayton did not accompany the title, and shortly afterwards it became the property of Mrs. Jolliffe (relative of William Jolliffe, Esq. M. P. for Petersfield, who died in 1802), the younger daughter, and eventually sole heiress of Sir Richard Musgrave Bart. The Joliffe family did not live at the castle preferring to lease it as a tenant farm. Among past tenant farmers since that time we find, the Reverend Isaac Robinson, 1916; John Blackburn and his son 1828; John Blackstock, Nancy his widow 1882; Thomas Biglands, a well-known sportsman, tenant until 1903, when the property was purchased by David Mitchell, whose family retain the property today. Mitchell came from Scotland, having recently returned from South Africa, where he had served in the British Army for three years during the Anglo Boer War.West Cumberland Times, 4 October 1919. Description One should assume that no building of any great importance existed at Hayton before the rise of the Mulcaster family. Sir Piers de Tilliol apparently preferred to live at Scaleby and as such left no mark at Hayton, leaving most of the building and alterations which gave the castle its present-day appearance to the Musgrave family. Today the building is a rectangle measuring about 29 metres from North to South and 16 metres from East to West. The north end is the best preserved, and most of the extensive alterations have been carried out at the south end. The most curious feature of the main fabric is a 2-metre thick wall in the centre of the building, probably a survivor of the original castle.Bulmer, pp. 122‚Äì123. Hayton Castle is one of several places in Cumberland which offered hospitality to Mary, Queen of Scots and it is said that she spent a night here on 17 May 1568.Rose, p. 64. On leaving she presented her host with a miniature painting of herself, forming the centre of a plain gold ring, a treasure that passed through many generations. She is said however to have spent the same night at Cockermouth. The old manorial residence has come down from its former high estate and now serves the purpose of a farm house. However it still bears reminders of its illustrious past. There are three staircases within the castle, the main stairway is made of stone and at the first turn, situated in the wall, is the Musgrave shield. It contains six annulets, three, two and one with a martlet below the three, while parallel is seen the bend raguly on a field gules, of the Penruddock family of Arkelby, a branch of the old lords of Penruddock. The coat of arms was probably erected by Sir Edward Musgrave, who married Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Penruddock of Arkelby and Exeter. Sir Edward's mother was a Martindale, hence the arms outside. The annulet is the cadency device of their fifth son, while the martlet is that of the fourth son. The crest of the Musgrave's consists of two arms in armour, hands gauntleted proper and grasping an annulet which may represent Hylton. The stone slab bears the legend LAVS. TIBI. DNE REX .GL. ORIE. (Praise to Thee, O God, the King of Glory). The arms follow, the crest piercing the space between the first and second and third and fourth words above given. Then follows the date AD 1609, and the words:- PRECOR. VT.SIMVS. MEMORES. BENEFICI ORUM. ERGA. NOS. The petitioner entreats the King of Kings out of his love to be mindful of himself and family and to show his favour towards them. A second spiral stone staircase, which is evidently a remnant of a long flight of stairs ascending from the floor to roof is a slab relating to the existence of a domestic chapel that once existed somewhere below. This slab in an old window in the east wall bears the following inscription:- ::‚ÄúThis chapel was repaired at the proper cost of Ann Musgrave, third daughter of Sir Richard Musgrave, Baronet, and Dame Dorothy, his wife, in ye year Anno Domini, 1719.‚Äù According to some observers this refers to an oratory in the castle itself. Alternatively it is said that formerly there was a chapel adjacent to the castle, and that the inscription refers o a restoration of the building. It is said that this same chapel was in use till 1820, when it was dismantled and rapidly fell in decay. No trace of it now remains.Bailey, pp. 75‚Äì76. While above the 17th century fireplace is another example of the Musgrave arms thought to have been erected by Anne Musgrave daughter of Sir Richard and his wife Dorothy. On an outside wall, the north wall, is the coat of arms of Martindale or Mulcaster, viz., Argent and gules, with a bend sable. In the garden is a stone sundial bearing the initials of Sir Richard, son of Sir Edward, and Anne his wife with a date of 1725. English Civil War The English Civil War did not deal kindly with Hayton Castle or its owners. Sir Edward Musgrave, created a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1638 was an ardent Royalist, and spared neither is person nor his fortune in this cause. He maintained a regiment of horse at his own expense and in 1648, with the rank of colonel took part in the Battle of Preston. and it is recorded that when, at the Battle of Worcester, the horse of King Charles II was shot from under him, Sir Edward dismounted and supplied the King with his own horse. After the defeat Musgrave found refuge in Scotland with the Duke of Gordon, and so badly was he wanted by the Parliament that when his refuge was discovered Cromwell informed the Duke that ‚Äúif he did not forthwith deliver up Ned Musgrave he would send a troop of horse to storm his castle‚Äù. Musgrave was allowed to escape and he fled to the Isle of Man where he afterwards died. Hayton Castle received considerable damage from the Parliamentary forces. The south end, the most vulnerable, came off worse as after the war was over; this portion was entirely rebuilt by Sir Edward's son Richard. Hayton Castle is one of several places in Cumberland which offered hospitality to Mary, Queen of Scots and it is said that she spent a night here on 17 May 1568. On leaving she presented her host with a miniature painting of herself, forming the centre of a plain gold ring, a treasure that passed through many generations.

Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in early July 1864. While no significant battles took place along the River Line, it remains one of the most impressive defensive fortifications ever constructed, often compared to the French Maginot Line built prior to World War II. Part of the River Line Historic Area and the Chattahoochee River Line Battlefield, the site today consists of the remains of Confederate earthwork battlements including unique fortifications called Shoupades, named after their designer, Confederate Brig. General Francis A. Shoup. The remains are spread across a six to seven mile stretch along the northwest side of the Chattahoochee River from a point just north of where Nickajack Creek joins the Chattahoochee in Mableton to north of S. Atlanta Road in Smyrna/Vinings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 5, 1973. Although many of the remains are on private property, visitors can access the site off U.S. 78 in Mableton, and off S.R. 280 and S. Atlanta Rd in Smyrna/Vinings. The site's coordinates are .  History  From the beginning of the Atlanta Campaign in May 1864, the Union Army under the command of General William T. Sherman had managed to out-maneuver Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee throughout Northwest Georgia forcing them to fall back to a defensive position at Kennesaw Mountain in late June. Johnston saw the nearby Chattahoochee River as the largest natural boundary between his army and the city of Atlanta. He had already dispatched a hundred men to protect the Western & Atlantic Railroad bridge that crossed the river near the community of Bolton. Johnston feared the loss of thousands of men should Sherman's Army attack the Confederates during a retreat across the river. He also knew this would likely be the location of a final \\"last stand\\" in the defense of Atlanta.Chattahoochee River Line aboutnorthgeorgia.com On June 18, 1864, roughly a week before the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, Johnston was approached by his Artillery Commander, Brig. General Francis A. Shoup, about the construction of a defensive line high atop a ridge along the northwest bank of the Chattahoochee River to which the Confederate Army could withdraw should Sherman continue his pattern of flanking maneuvers. Shoup envisioned a line of such strength as to deter any direct assault and such efficiency as to require a mere fraction of Johnston's men to hold while the majority could defend the Chattahoochee against an attempted Federal bridgehead. Johnston approved Shoup's proposal and work began the next day. Construction of what was first called the Chattahoochee River Line started on June 19 and would take about two weeks requiring a labor force of both convalescing soldiers from nearby hospitals and over one thousand impressed slaves.Johnston's River Line Michael K. Shaffer While some trenches existed near the state railroad bridge that could be expanded and lengthened, most of the line would be built from scratch. Shoup's design consisted of a series of arrowhead-shaped infantry forts‚Äî36 in total were built‚Äîspaced sixty to 175 yards apart and connected by trenches broken every thirty to 75 yards by artillery redans that would house two artillery pieces. Each fort consisted of an earthen foundation with log walls or parapets extending fourteen to twenty feet high depending on the terrain. Interior earthen walls would stop short of the log exterior walls forming a platform on which infantrymen could fire over top the fort. At the rear or base of the fort and behind the line would be an entrance or sally port. From above, the line would look like a saw blade with the trenches connecting the forts receding at a backward angle to each redan and then at a forward angle to the next fort creating what Shoup called a re- entrant. Along the front of the trenches would be walls or palisades made of stockades. Each fort could hold up to eighty men. Soldiers within the forts could load rifles and hand them up to riflemen on the earthen platforms who would provide interlocking fields of fire channeling an attacking force towards the re-entrant formed by the receding trenches where artillery fire from the redans would sweep the ground. If all the forts were manned at once, the River Line would prove to be a quite formidable opponent. About a week into the River Line's construction, Johnston, fearing another maneuver by the Union Army around his left flank, ordered a reluctant Shoup to extend the southwestern end of the line to a position covering the Mayson-Turner Ferry across the Chattahoochee. By the time Confederate troops began falling back to a temporary line in Smyrna on July 3 following the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, most of what would now be called Johnston's River Line had been completed. When the first Confederate soldiers arrived at the River Line on the evening of July 4, many, including Lt. General John B. Hood, were skeptical of its design and even began modifying it into something more conventional.Johnston's River Line sherpaguides.com Maj. General Patrick Cleburne, however, judged the works to be excellent, and Maj. General Gustavus W. Smith remarked that the design would make Shoup famous even naming the forts \\"Shoupades.\\" As Johnston had predicted, when Sherman first learned of the Confederates' retreat to a line within several miles of the Chattahoochee River, he impressed upon his commanders \\"the importance of the most intense energy of attack...at any cost of life and material.\\" He was convinced that Johnston took up this position only in hope of delaying Federal pursuit. No general, Sherman told one of his officers, would invite battle with the Chattahoochee behind him. Upon first observing the River Line himself the morning of July 5 from a Vinings hilltop, however, Sherman sent a wire to Washington saying he would have to \\"study the case a little\\" before proceeding. Finding the area still occupied with a Confederate Army more than prepared for a repetition of the events a week prior, he deemed it \\"the best line of field entrenchments [he had] ever seen.\\"Foote, Shelby. The Civil War, A Narrative: Red River to Appomattox. New York, NY: Random House, 1974. p. 403-404 His chief engineer, Captain Orlando M. Poe, reported that the line \\"was by far the strongest [he] had yet encountered\\" and that \\"it would cost many lives to carry the position by assault.\\" It wouldn't take Sherman long to revert to his time-tested method of attempting to maneuver rather than attack. Although Federal troops constructed both trenches and battery positions opposing Johnston's River Line, General Sherman had no intention of a direct assault‚Äîespecially following his underestimation of Johnston's defensive position at Kennesaw Mountain. While half the Federal forces would eventually be positioned in front of the River Line, nothing more than a few daily artillery duels would take place. In contrast with his pattern of maneuvering around Johnston's left flank, Sherman sent divisions north to find a crossing around the right flank of the River Line. By July 8 and 9, Union troops led by Brig. General Kenner Garrard and Maj. General John M. Schofield had secured crossings near Sope Creek and Roswell. Despite his claim that the position could be held for a month, Johnston had little choice but to abandon the River Line on the evening of July 9. This failure would lead to his dismissal from command by President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis. Shoup was devastated by the abandonment of his novel defensive system and lamented, \\"I took a long look at the works into which my heart had gone to such a degree and felt that the days of the Confederacy were numbered. I made good all I proposed...the line...could have been held by three thousand men for any reasonable time against a hundred thousand.\\" The River Line today As late as the 1950s, a person could walk the length of the River Line. Today, very little remains accessible as a result of commercial and residential development. While 36 Shoupades were originally constructed along the River Line, only nine remain in the form of earthwork foundations mostly covered by overgrowth. Only one exists on publicly owned land‚Äîa parcel along the Chattahoochee River south of U.S. 78 in Mableton‚Äîbought by Cobb County that also includes dozens of yards of infantry trench and a fort, all of which anchored the southwestern end of the River Line. Unfortunately, none of this land is easily accessible to the public. Three Shoupades and an artillery redan, while on private property, have been preserved by developers and can be accessed by the public. Two of the three Shoupades and the redan are partially enclosed by a fence installed by a residential developer who agreed to preserve the site and turn it into what is now called Shoupade Park in Smyrna, complete with interpretive signs. Five Shoupades in total originally existed within a half mile of the park, however two were destroyed by homeowners seeking to reuse the land for other purposes or preserve its value for future sale and development. The only other Shoupade that has been preserved and can be easily accessed is located in Mableton behind River Line Park. While the park is publicly owned, the Shoupade is on privately owned land that is part of a residential development bordering the park. This developer also agreed to preserve the Shoupade and install a fence and interpretive sign. The remaining Shoupades and many yards of infantry trench, both Confederate and Federal, still exist but are on private property buried within neighborhoods or along steep or inaccessible terrain. Other historic sites related to the River Line include the Howell Mill Dam, Hooper-Turner House, Turner-Sewell Cemetery and the Log Cabin Community Sunday School. The Howell Mill Dam is located in Mableton along Nickajack Creek on land purchased by Cobb County in 2006. Just upstream of the site where the mill once stood, the dam has yet to be made accessible to the public. Located just north of River Line Park, the Hooper-Turner House is an antebellum \\"hall and parlor\\" style home built in the 1850s and once owned by two of Cobb County's pioneering families, the Thomas Hooper family and the John R. Turner family‚Äîthe latter of whom operated the Mayson-Turner Ferry that crossed the Chattahoochee River at today's U.S. 78.Hooper-Turner House riverline.org The house is presently owned by the city of Smyrna and, although listed on the Cobb County Historic Register, has been slated for demolition.
