Saint-Jalmes, \\"Foams: structure and dynamics\\", Oxford University Press, ed. S.J. Cox, 2013, is one of the main processes by which cellular materials such as foams or biological tissues change shapes. It involves four discrete objects such as bubbles, drops, cells, etc. The four objects are initially arranged in a plane in the following way. Objects A and B are in contact and objects C and D are on either side of the AB group and touching both A and B. The T1 process consists in breaking the contact between A and B and establishing the contact between C and D. When a significant number of rearrangement events such as T1 processes with similar orientations occur inside a foam or a tissue, the material correspondingly undergoes a deformation: it elongates in the direction in which neighbours depart (here, AB) while it contracts in the direction in which new neighbour pairs form (here, CD). As a result of the existence of the T1 and similar processes, materials made of these objects have a number of similar rheological properties. Among these, plasticity allows them to be deformed irreversibly. For such materials, such irreversible deformations arise from the ability to rearrange their constitutive objects. Thus, the T1 process is the major mesoscopic ingredient of plasticity for these materials.

Background Finnish attempts to find an acceptable exit from the Continuation War in spring 1944 alarmed the Germans, who had sizable stores in Northern Finland. In April 1944, the Germans started a feverish effort to recon and construct defensive positions against possible advances from the south.Ahto (1980) p. 37Lunde (2011) p. 322-325 Plan The name Birke was assigned for the operation on 9 April 1944. Its primary task was to provide protection to the then vital nickel mining operations at Petsamo (now Pechenga, Russia). Orders for the operation were prepared meticulously in extreme detail. It consisted of several phases, the first of which, triggered by the code phrase \\"Birke anschlagen\\" (mark the birch for felling), would consist of evacuation of military stores and preparation for later phases. The second phase, keyed to the code phrase \\"Birke f√§llen\\" (fell the birch), would consist of the actual military withdrawal to the first fortified position using a scorched earth policy. The final planned phase, keyed to the code phrase \\"Birke zerkleinern\\" (crush the birch), would send German units towards strong positions around Rovaniemi while fighting a delaying action.Ahto (1980) p. 38-41 Operation The first phase of the operation was started on 3 September 1944 after Finns had informed the Germans of their intentions. Though the plan had called for two weeks time for evacuations before the second phase Germans pressed ahead and started the second phase of the operation already on 4 September. 20th Mountain Army managed to evacuate sizeable amount of the war material and get the withdrawal towards Norway well underway under the Operation Birke.Ahto (1980) p.70,Lunde (2011) p.327 Results Since existing German stocks of nickel were deemed sufficient and new deposits had been located in Austria the importance of holding Petsamo region or Finnish Lapland decreased considerably. At the same time the logistical and military difficulties of defending Northern Finland were realized. These factors made it possible for the Germans, on 4 October 1944, to gain Hitler's approval for moving from Operation Birke to Operation Nordlicht (Operation Northern Light) and abandon Northern Finland and fortify to Lyngen, Norway.Ahto (1980) p. 92-99Lunde (2011) p. 342-343 See also * Lapland War * Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation * Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light) References Bibliography * * Category:Conflicts in 1944 Category:Battles and operations of the Eastern Front of World War II Category:Arctic military operations of World War II ","title":"Operation Birke"},{"id":"33702443","text":"Jocelyn Rae and Jade Windley were the defending champions, but both chose not to participate.

The EBA was identified in 2001 by the team of Nancy Kanwisher using fMRI. Function The extrastriate body area is a category-selective region for the visual processing of static and moving images of the human body and parts of it. It is also modulated even in the absence of visual feedback from the limb movement. It is insensitive to faces and stimulus categories unrelated to the human body. The extrastriate cortex responds not only during the perception of other people's body parts but also during goal-directed movement of the participant's body parts. The extrastriate cortex represents the human body in a more integrative and dynamic manner, being able to detect an incongruence of internal body or action representations and external visual signals. In this way, the EBA might be able to support the disentangling of one's own behavior from another's. Experiments and Research Timeline of the task, study by Urgesi et al. (2004) As published in the article, ‚ÄúA Cortical Area Selective for Visual Processing of the Human Body,‚Äù researcher, Paul E. Downing, Yuhong Jiang, Miles Shuman and Nancy Kanwisher, first discovered the EBA in 2001. The experiment originally intended to find out what area of the brain dealt with the human form and recognition of body parts, as the face had been mapped to a specific area of the brain (Fusiform Face Area, FFA) by Nancy Kanwisher in 1997. What the experiment found was a specific area of the lateral occipitotemporal cortex that responds selectively to visual images of human bodies and body parts, with the exception of faces. The experiment had subjects view images of different objects, including faces (as a control group), body parts, animals, parts of the face and intimate objects. While viewing the images, the subjects were scanned with an fMRI to see what area of the brain was activated. Through the trials a compilation of the fMRI‚Äôs was made. From this compilation image a specific region was determined to have increased activity when shown visual stimuli of body parts and even more activity when viewing whole bodies. Reaction time graph, study by Urgesi et al. (2004) There have been no studies involving brain damage to the EBA. Thus far, only scans of brain activity, as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been used to study the EBA. To find the specific functions of the EBA, Comimo Urgesi, Giovanni Berlucchi and Salvatore M. Aglioti used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt part of the brain, making the brain less responsive in the target area. The study used event-related rTMS to disrupt the EBA, resulting in inactivation of cortical areas. This inactivation caused a slower response time in discriminating body parts. The study used facial features and motorcycle parts as non human parts for control groups. The facial features and motorcycle body parts did not display any change in response time. The neural activity data shows the EBA handles some of the visual processing of human body and parts but is not related to the processing of the face or other objects. The actual experiment had people make a ‚Äútwo-choice matching-to-sample task. Fourteen right handed participants were required to decide which of two similar upper- limb images matched a single sample previously seen during a tachistoscopic exposure. Photos of face parts and motorcycle parts served as control stimuli in two-matching-to-sample tasks that were comparable to the former task.‚Äù rTMS was then applied 150 ms after each sample exposure. The section of the graph, Body Parts, shows the response time while using rTMS. The SHAM category refers to measuring the EBA without rTMS while viewing the images. The Visual Cortex category measures the response of the FFA to be used as the control of the experiment. This measurement of response time, occurring while rTMS was effecting the EBA, further shows that the two areas process visual data of the human form, yet respond to different stimuli. While the magnetic stimulation was temporarily disabling the extrastraite body area, reaction time decreased by about 100 ms. The data from the Sham and Visual Cortex categories on the graph show what was the expected normal results from the experiment. This evidence reveals that applying rTMS to the EBA slowed the response of recognizing images of body parts.

A 2012 review of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies shows that subliminal stimuli activate specific regions of the brain despite participants being unaware. Visual stimuli may be quickly flashed before an individual can process them, or flashed and then masked, thereby interrupting the processing. Audio stimuli may be played below audible volumes or masked by other stimuli. Effectiveness Applications of subliminal stimuli often base themselves on the persuasiveness of the message. Importantly, research on action priming has shown that subliminal stimuli can trigger only actions a receiver of the message plans to perform anyway. However, consensus of subliminal messaging remains unsubstantiated by other research. Most actions can be triggered subliminally only if the person is already prepared to perform a specific action. The following sections have more information on specific studies which investigate the effectiveness of subliminal stimuli. The context that the stimulus is presented in affects their effectiveness. If the target is thirsty then a subliminal stimuli for a drink is likely to influence the target to purchase that drink if it is readily available. The stimuli can also influence the target to choose the primed option over other habitually chosen options. If the subliminal stimuli is for a product that is not quickly accessible or if there is no need for it within a specific context then the subliminal stimuli will have little to no effect. Even when people believe they are making a \\"free choice\\" subliminal priming can be directing their actions. When primed to push a button with their off-hand, people will use that hand even if given a free choice between using their off-hand and their dominant hand. However, a meta analysis of many strong articles displaying effectiveness of subliminal messaging revealed its effects on actual consumer purchasing choices between two alternatives are not statistically significant. Subliminal messaging is only effective in very specific contexts. Method The threshold in subliminal stimuli research is the level at which the participant is not aware of the stimulus being presented. Researchers determine a threshold for the stimulus that will be used as the subliminal stimulus. That subliminal stimulus is then presented during the study at some point and measures are taken to determine the effects of the stimulus. The way in which studies operationally define thresholds depends on the methods of the particular article. The methodology of the research also varies by the type of subliminal stimulus (auditory or visual) and the dependent variables they measure. =Objective threshold= The objective threshold is found using a forced choice procedure, in which participants must choose which stimulus they saw from options given to them. Participants are flashed a stimulus (e.g. the word \\"orange\\") and then given a few choices and asked which one they saw. Participants must choose an answer in this design. The objective threshold is obtained when participants are at chance level of performance in this task. The length of presentation that causes chance performance on the forced choice task is used later in the study for the subliminal stimuli. =Subjective threshold= The subjective threshold is determined by when the participant reports that his or her performance on the forced choice procedure approximates chance. The subjective threshold is 30 to 50 ms slower than the objective threshold, demonstrating that participants are able to detect the stimuli is present sooner than their perceived accuracy ratings would indicate. In other words, stimuli presented at a subjective threshold have a longer presentation time than those presented at an objective threshold. When using the objective threshold, primes neither facilitated nor inhibited the recognition of a color. However, the longer the duration of the priming stimuli, the greater effect it had on subsequent responding. These findings indicate that the results of some studies may be due to their definition of below threshold. =Direct and indirect measures= Perception without awareness can be demonstrated through the comparison of direct and indirect measures of perception. Direct measures use responses to task definitions as per the explicit instructions given to the subjects. Indirect measures use responses that are not a part of the task definition given to subjects. Both direct and indirect measures are displayed under comparable conditions except for the direct or indirect instruction. For example, in a typical Stroop Task, subjects are given the task of naming the color of a patch of ink. A direct measure is 'accuracy'‚Äîtrue to the instructions given to the participants. The popular indirect measure used in the same task is 'response time'‚Äîsubjects are not told that they are being measured for response times. Similarly, a direct effect is the effect of a task stimulus on the instructed response to that stimulus, usually measured as accuracy. An indirect effect is an uninstructed effect of the task stimulus on behavior, sometimes measured by including an irrelevant or distracting component in the task stimulus and measuring its effect on accuracy. These effects are then compared on their relative sensitivity: an indirect effect that is greater than direct effect indicates existence of unconscious cognition. Visual stimuli In order to study the effects of subliminal stimuli, researchers will often prime the participants with specific visual stimuli, often images, and determine if those stimuli elicit different responses. Subliminal stimuli have mostly been studied in the context of emotion, in particular, researchers have focused a lot of attention to the perception of faces and how subliminal presentation to different facial expression affects emotion. Visual subliminal stimuli has also been used to study emotion eliciting stimuli and simple geometric stimuli. A significant amount of research has been produced throughout the years to demonstrate the effects of subliminal visual stimuli. =Images= Attitudes can develop without being aware of its antecedents. Individuals viewed slides of people performing familiar daily activities after being exposed to either an emotionally positive scene, such as a romantic couple or kittens, or an emotionally negative scene, such as a werewolf or a dead body between each slide and the next. After exposure from something which the individuals consciously perceived as a flash of light, the participants gave more positive personality traits to those people whose slides were associated with an emotionally positive scene and vice versa. Despite the statistical difference, the subliminal messages www.monyms.ir had less of an impact on judgment than the slide's inherent level of physical attractiveness. Individuals show right amygdala activity in response to subliminal fear, and greater left amygdala response to supraliminal fear. People were exposed to a subliminal image flashed for 16.7 milliseconds that could signal a potential threat and again with a supraliminal image flashed for half a second. Furthermore, supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity, suggesting that subliminal fear may not entail conscious surveillance while supraliminal fear entails higher- order processing. =Emotion eliciting stimuli= A subliminal sexual stimulus has a different effect on men compared to women. Men and women were subliminally exposed to either a sexual or a neutral picture, and their sexual arousal was recorded. Researchers examined the accessibility of sex-related thoughts after following the same procedure with either a pictorial judgment task or lexical decision task. The results revealed that the subliminal sexual stimuli did not have an effect on men, but for women, lower levels of sexual arousal were reported. However, in conditions related to accessibility of sex- related thoughts, the subliminal sexual stimuli led to higher accessibility for both men and women. Subliminal stimuli can elicit significant emotional changes, but these changes are not valuable for a therapeutic effect. Spider- fearful and non-fearful undergraduates experienced either a positive, negative, or neutral subliminal prime followed immediately by a picture of a spider or a snake. Using visual analogue scales, the participants rated the affective quality of the picture. No evidence was found to support that the unpleasantness of the pictures can be modulated by subliminal priming. In fact, the non-fearful participants rated the spiders as more frightening after being primed with a negative stimuli, however, for the fearful participants, this effect was not found. =Simple geometric stimuli= Laboratory research on unconscious perception often employs simple stimuli (e.g., geometric shapes or colors) in which visibility is controlled by visual masking. Masked stimuli are then used to prime the processing of subsequently presented target stimuli. For instance, in the Response Priming paradigm, participants have to respond to a target stimulus (e.g., by identifying whether it is a diamond or a square) which is immediately preceded by a masked priming stimulus (also a diamond or a square). The prime has large effects on responses to the target; it speeds responses when it is consistent with the target, and slows responses when it is inconsistent. Response priming effects can be dissociated from visual awareness of the prime, such as when prime identification performance is at chance, or when priming effects increase despite decreases in prime visibility. The presentation of geometric figures as subliminal stimuli can result in below threshold discriminations. The geometric figures were presented on slides of a tachistoscope followed by a supraliminal shock for a given slide every time it appeared. The shock was administered after a five- second interval. Electrical skin changes of the participants that occurred before the reinforcement (shock) or non-reinforcement were recorded. The findings indicate that the proportion of electrical skin changes that occurred following subliminal visual stimuli was significantly greater than expected. In contrast, the proportion of electrical skin changes that occurred in response to the stimuli which were not reinforced was significantly less. As a whole, participants were able to make below threshold discriminations. =Word and non-word stimuli= Another form of visual stimuli are words and non- words. In a set of experiments, words and non-word were used as subliminal primes. Primes that work best as subliminal stimuli are words that have been classified several times before they are used as primes. Word primes can also be made from parts of practiced words to create new words. In this case, the actual word used as a prime can have the opposite meaning of the words it came from (its \\"parents\\"), but it will still prime for the meaning of the parent words. Non-words created from previously practiced stimuli have a similar effect, even when they are unpronounceable (e.g., made of all consonants). These primes generally only increase response times for later stimuli for a very short period of time (milliseconds). =Masking visual stimuli= Visual stimuli are often masked by forward and backward masks so that they can be displayed for longer periods of time, but without the subject being able to tell what the prime is. A forward mask displayed before the prime for a short period of time and usually a backward mask will follow the prime. This prevents recognition of the prime by the subject. Auditory stimuli =Auditory masking= One method for creating subliminal auditory stimuli is called masking. This method involves hiding the target auditory stimulus in some way. Auditory subliminal stimuli are shown to have some effect on the participant, but not a large one. For example, one study used other speechlike sounds to cover up the target words. The study found evidence of priming in the absence of awareness of the stimuli. But the effects of these subliminal stimuli were only seen in one of the outcome measures of priming, while the effects of conscious stimuli were seen in multiple outcome measures. However, the empirical evidence for the assumption of an impact of auditory subliminal stimuli on human behavior remains weak: In an experimental study on the influence of subliminal target words (embedded into a music track) on choice behavior for a drink, authors found no evidence for a manipulative effect. =Self-help audio recordings= A study investigated the effects on self- concept of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and auditory subliminal stimulation (separately and in combination) on 141 undergraduate students with self-concept problems. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving either Rational-Emotive Therapy, subliminal stimulation, both, or a placebo treatment. Rational-Emotive Therapy significantly improved scores on all the dependent measures (cognition, self-concept, self-esteem, anxiety), except for behavior. Results for the subliminal stimulation group were similar to those of the placebo treatment except for a significant self-concept improvement and a decline in self-concept related irrational cognitions. The combined treatment yielded results similar to those of Rational-Emotive Therapy, with tentative indications of continued improvement in irrational cognitions and self-concept from posttest to follow-up.Comparison of the effects of auditory subliminal stimulation and rational-emotive therapy, separately and combined, on self-concept. M√∂ller AT, Kotz√© HF, Sieberhagen KJ. Department of Psychology, University of Stellenbosch, RSA. Another study investigated the effects of self-help tapes on self-esteem and memory. Volunteers who wanted to improve their self-esteem or memory were recruited and completed several self-esteem and memory tests before being given a self- help tape. Subjects were given a self-esteem audio tape or a memory audio tape, but half of the tapes were mislabeled and half were correctly labeled. After listening to the tapes daily for five weeks, subjects came back and repeated the self-esteem and memory tests. There was no significant change from the first set of testing to the second, although subjects believed that their self-esteem or memory improved based on which tape they believed they had, even when they had a mislabeled tape (those who had tapes labeled as self-esteem tapes felt their self-esteem had increased and the same with memory). This effect is often referred to as a placebo. There are multiple other studies on subliminal self-help with different measures and have given similar results. Consumption and television Some studies have looked at the efficacy of subliminal messaging in television. Subliminal messages produce only one-tenth of the effects of detected messages and the findings related the effects of subliminal messaging were relatively ambiguous. Also, participants‚Äô ratings of positive response to commercials are not affected by subliminal messages in the commercials. Karremans suggests that subliminal messages have an effect when the messages are goal-relevant. Subliminally priming a brand name of a soft drink (Lipton Ice) made those who were thirsty want the Lipton Ice. However, those who were not thirsty were not influenced by the subliminal messages. Karremans did a study assessing whether subliminal priming of a brand name of a drink would affect a person's choice of drink, and whether this effect is caused by the individual's feelings of being thirsty. In another study, participant's ratings of thirst were higher after viewing an episode of The Simpsons that contained single frames of the word \\"thirsty\\" or of a picture of a Coca-Cola can. Some studies have shown greater effects of subliminal messaging with as high as 80% of participants showing a preference for a particular rum when subliminally primed by the name placed in an ad backward. Martin Gardner, however, criticizes claims, such as those by Wilson Bryan Key, by pointing out that \\"recent studies\\" serving as the basis for his claims were not identified by place or experimenter. He also suggests that claims about subliminal images are due to the \\"tendency of chaotic shapes to form patterns vaguely resembling familiar things.\\" Many authors have continued to argue for the effectiveness of subliminal cues in changing consumption behavior, citing environmental cues as a main culprit of behavior change. Authors who support this line of reasoning cite findings such as the research that showed slow-paced music in a supermarket was associated with more sales and customers moving at a slower pace. Findings such as these support the notion that external cues can affect behavior, although the stimulus may not fit into a strict definition of subliminal stimuli because although the music may not be attended to or consciously affecting the customers, they are certainly able to perceive it. Subliminal messaging is prohibited in advertising in the United Kingdom. \\"No advertisement may use images of very brief duration, or any other technique that is likely to influence consumers, without their being fully aware of what has been done.\\"  See also  * Instances of subliminal messages * Subliminal messages in popular culture * Neuroethics * Peripheral vision horizon display (PVHD) * Pre-attentive processing * Priming (psychology) * Response priming * References Further reading   * Category:Sensory systems ","title":"Subliminal stimuli"},{"id":"33702526","text":"Quality Hill, also known as the John Thomson Mason House, is a historic building, located at 3425 Prospect Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., in the Georgetown neighborhood.

It is a deep-sea species found in the Arctic Ocean, and appears to be common at depths below .Bathykorus bouilloni Raskoff , 2010 Arctic Ocean Diversity. Retrieved November 7, 2011. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Bathykorus. The genus name comes from the Greek bathy meaning \\"deep\\" and korus meaning \\"helmet\\", referring to the depth at which this species is found and to the shape of the bell. Its helmet-like appearance bears a resemblance to the helmet of Darth Vader, giving it the nickname Darth Vader jellyfish. The specific name is in honour of Dr. Jean Bouillon, (1926‚Äì2009), a marine zoologist. Description B. bouilloni is a small, gelatinous hydrozoan growing to around in width. It is transparent and pale blue, with four primary noncontractile tentacles set high above the margin of the dome-shaped bell. Lower down near the undulating margin are four short secondary tentacles, each with a statocyst on either side. The central circular mouth on the oral surface leads to a gastric chamber out of which lead 12 gastric pouches, three in each quadrant. The primary tentacles are solid and usually held above the bell in the direction of locomotion when the animal is foraging. The tentacles bear cnidocytes on the aboral side. The gonads have not yet been observed, perhaps because they were not ripe at the time of the year when observations were made (June/July). Distribution B. bouilloni is found in the Arctic Ocean, especially around Greenland and the north of Canada. The jellyfish can only be found at an underwater depth range of , but it is more common in the middle of this range. Biology Because of the depths at which this species is found, it is not possible to visually observe it in situ, and observations are usually made by remotely operated underwater vehicles. Nor is it easy to study specimens because they tend not to survive capture by netting. Some individuals have been caught by gentle suction and brought to the surface and it has proved possible to keep these alive in dark tanks at 1 ¬∞C (34 ¬∞F) for a week or more.

He was a member of the jury at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival in 1988. In 2003 he was awarded the title of People's Artist of Russia. Biography =Early life and education= Andrei Sergeevich Smirnov was born on 12 March 1941 in Moscow to the family of writer Sergei Smirnov - author of books about the defenders of the Brest Fortress. When the young man studied in the seventh grade, the family moved to Maryina roshcha District, where Andrei continued his studies in a special French school. After finishing school, he was accepted at the directing department of VGIK, Mikhail Romm's workshop. He graduated in 1962. =Career= As a director, he made his debut with the war film The Land of the Earth (1964, together with Boris Yashin) based on the story of the same name by Grigory Baklanov. Andrei Smirnov's first great success came when he directed the 1971 drama film Belorussian Station, which showed the psychological atmosphere of events closely intertwined with the memory of the Great Patriotic War. In his next film, Autumn (1974), he turned to the theme of love, with an unusual for that time boldness about the relationship between the thirty-year-old man and woman. After the film Faith and Truth (1979), devoted to different stages of the construction of Moscow, Smirnov decided to leave the filmmaking. The reason was the criticism of various authorities and dissatisfaction with his own work. Smirnov began to work mainly as a screenwriter and playwright. His play My Own in 1985 was staged by the Moscow Satire Theatre. He wrote screenplays for the films Sentimental Journey to Potatoes (1986), I Did Everything I Could (1986), and also the episodes The Medicine of Fear in the second season of television series Beyond the Wolves (2004). In the 1990s, Smirnov staged television performances, television concerts, and theater productions. Among them - Dinner in the Moscow Art Theatre - Theater-Studio O. Tabakov (1994), A Month in the Country in Com√©die- Fran√ßaise (1997). In 2011, he returned to filmmaking and made a national drama Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman, acting simultaneously as a screenwriter and producer. The picture was recognized as the best film of the year according to the Russian cinema award Nika. It also received four more Nika prizes - for the best script work, best female role, best supporting actor and for the best work of the costume designer. Andrei Smirnov as an actor starred in a number of notable roles. Among his works - the main roles in the films Chernov (1990) by Sergei Yursky, His Wife's Diary (2000) by Alexei Uchitel, Fathers and Sons (2008) by Avdotya Smirnova and Elena (2011) by Andrey Zvyagintsev. Smirnov also starred in the series The Right to Defense (2002), The Idiot (2003), The Instructor (2003), Moscow Saga (2004), The First Circle (2006), The Apostle (2008) ), Heavy Sand (2008), Churchill (2009), The Thaw (2013), Black Cats (2013), etc. Andrei Smirnov was engaged in public activities. In 1988-1990, he was Acting First Secretary of the Union of Cinematographers of the USSR. Between 1987-1995 he was the artistic director of the studio \\"Debut\\". He taught at the High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors. Personal life Andrei Smirnov is married with a second marriage to Honored Artist of Russia Elena Prudnikova. His first wife was actress Natalia Rudnaya. Smirnov has two daughters from his first marriage - Avdotya and Alexander, from the second - daughter Aglaya and son Alexey. Avdotya (Dunya) Smirnova - a well-known screenwriter and director, was the host of the television program \\"School of Slander\\".

Though the dispute was officially resolved in 1731, effects of the boundary conflict persisted until well after both colonies gained statehood as part of the United States following the American Revolution. Background The dispute originated largely as an extension of a wider ongoing conflict between the colonial ambitions of benefactors of the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England. Much of the Dutch jurisprudence was based on the writings of the legal scholar Hugo Grotius, who emphasized claiming the land and interaction with the natives. The English did not generally accept Grotius' theories, in particular his Mare Liberum. When Henry Hudson had first explored the area in 1609, he was employed by the Dutch, so the Netherlands could base its claim on both first discovery and status as financial backer. In addition, the Dutch felt that ‚Äúthat territorial possession depended on recognition of the rights of indigenous people in regard to their territory as well as on a Dutch military presence to defend the claim from European incursion.‚Äù While the majority of the Dutch population of New Netherland clustered around the Hudson River and western Long Island, the Dutch still maintained forts and trading posts along the Connecticut River (e.g., Fort Hoop, in modern-day Hartford) and went on frequent expeditions to exploit the natural resources of the area (e.g., beaver hunting). By contrast, the exploding population of the neighboring New England Colonies placed ever more farms and settlements across Connecticut and Long Island Sound. Connecticut Colony also based its claims on conquest. Following the end of the Pequot War in 1638, Connecticut had signed a treaty with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes ceding all of the Pequot lands to Connecticut. The English also rejected the claim that Hudson's discovery secured the area for the Dutch: Hudson was an Englishman and had not been hired to explore the area, but had rather discovered it by accident. Another English objection to Dutch control was based in dealings with the natives. The English believed the Dutch had endangered the \\"adjoining Countries most wickedly, feloniously, and traitorously, contrary to the Marine and Admirall Laws of all Christians, [by selling] wholesale guns, powder, shot and ammunition to the Indians, instructing them in the use of our fights and arms.\\"Plantagenet, Beauchamp. 'A Description of the Province of New Albion' . 1648. The Dutch claim to the land was further weakened when Peter Stuyvesant justified trading guns by citing pressure from the natives. Treaty of 1650 between New Netherlands and Connecticut Anglia Nova, displaying Dutch claims prior to 1650, 1635 1685 reprint of 1650 map of New Netherland, which is not a completely correct representation of the situation at the time. The border with New England had been adjusted to 50 miles west of the Fresh River, while the Lange Eylandt towns west of Oyster Bay were under Dutch jurisdiction. In 1650, the Treaty of Hartford sought to set the border between New Netherlands and the colonies of Connecticut. The main land was split by a line 50 miles from the Connecticut River and Long Island was divided into an East (Connecticut) and West (New Netherland) at Oyster Bay. However, the treaty was never ratified back in England, which left the border unresolved when the Province of New York was created by a sea-to-sea grant in 1664, just two years after Connecticut had been issued a sea-to-sea charter in 1662. The colonies of New York and Connecticut =Governor Nicolls and the 1664 agreement= The settlers from Connecticut and New York jostled over their respective claims. Long Islanders who had arrived from New England were very resistant to becoming New Yorkers. Local government under the Duke's charter gave no guarantee of assembly or ‚Äúother privileges to which [New Englanders] had become accustomed.‚Äù In 1664, Charles II of England sent royal commissioners, led by Gov. Nicolls, in part to ‚Äúend unneighbourly and unbrotherly contentions‚Äù about the borders. The commissioners met with John Winthrop and Connecticut commissioners in November 1664. As part of the agreement, announced in December 1664, the main land was divided ‚Äúby the consent‚Äù of the commissioners with a north-northwest line at the mouth of the Mamaroneck River. Long Island, which was explicitly mentioned only in the grant to the Duke of York, was entirely given to New York. Though nominally an agreement, the ‚Äúlanguage of the agreement, however, gave it the character of a declaration or order to which Connecticut submitted as a subordinate.‚Äù The new line was west of the 1650 agreement, but it kept Westchester for NY. The line also cut off the Hudson around West Point, making Albany a part of Connecticut. Because few Europeans lived along the Hudson, it's unclear whether the line's intersection with it was known by the commissioners at the time. In 1665, Commissioner George Cartwright reported ‚ÄúThe Bounds betwixt the Dukes province and Connecticut were mistaken by wrong Information, for it was not intended they should come nearer to Hudsons river then 20 miles, Yett the line was sett doune by the Commissioners to goe from such a Point Nor-nor-west whereas it ought to goes just North, otherwise the line will go into Hudsons river.‚Äù In 1675, a New York review of the boundary claimed there was a verbal agreement that the line should be at all times 20 miles from the Hudson; and in 1683, Gov. Dongan heard witnesses testify that the Connecticut commissioners had assured Gov. Nicolls that ‚Äúthe river Mamranet was twenty miles every where from Hudson's River.‚Äù However, the agreement explicitly required royal approval, and since it concerned the grant to the Duke of York it required his approval as well. Neither approval was ever given. =Governor Lovelace and the return of New Amsterdam= Upon replacing Gov. Nicolls, Gov. Lovelace did not actively press the Duke of York's claims under his grant. The government of New York was less stable than that of Connecticut. It was economically weaker and had to unite a much more heterogeneous population. For a short period in 1673, New York reverted to New Amsterdam under Dutch control. The Dutch had by this time ratified the 1650 agreement. This would mark a significant loss to Connecticut, which pressed for adherence to the 1664 agreement and the ouster of the Dutch. =Governor Andros and New York's 1674 patent= Following the Treaty of Westminster, New York was once again under English control. Gov. Andros returned to New York in 1674 with a new patent, again claiming all lands up to the Connecticut River. Gov. Andros showed a markedly aggressive tack in his negotiations with Connecticut. In May 1675, Andros sent a letter asking for land west of the Connecticut River under the Duke's new patent. When Gov. Winthrop objected, Andros sent a representative in June to demand Connecticut's submission, threatening to send soldiers against any rebellion. During this time of high tensions between the colonies, King Philip's War broke out in 1675. Andros attempted to use this to consolidate lands under the Duke's patent. At the start of the war, Andros sent troops to Fort Saybrook, nominally to defend. However, Winthrop's troops arrived first, and held the fort themselves. Andros requested that Winthrop temporarily relinquish Connecticut's claim to the area in order to strengthen the united defense. =Governor Dongan and the 1683 agreement= In the 1680s, the Duke of York's influence in England grew stronger, and Gov. Dongan was encouraged to seek a speedy resolution to the border dispute after his arrival in 1683. John Pell, a Westchester justice, granted a warrant requiring the constables of Rye, Greenwich, and Stamford to appear at a NY Court of Assizes in Oct 1683. Gov. Dongan told the court that Connecticut had violated the 1664 agreement and warned ‚ÄúIf you do not submitt to let us have all the land within twenty miles of Hudson's River, I must claime as far as the Duke's Pattent goes; which is to the River Connecticut. There is land enough for us all, and I love not to do my neighbors ill offices.‚Äù The border agreed upon in 1683 is the modern border; giving Rye to New York but allowing Connecticut to retain Greenwich and Stamford. ‚ÄúThe boundary would begin at the northwestern corner of Greenwich, proceed along a line eight miles north of and parallel to the Long Island Sound, then turn due north, extending to Massachusett's southern line.‚Äù In respect of the 1664 oral agreement, because Greenwich and Stamford were less than 20 miles from the Hudson the line was more than 20 miles away in the north, granting New York ‚Äúequivalent lands‚Äù in largely unpopulated areas. However, the 1683 agreement was never ratified back in England. As the Dominion of New England became a reality and quo warranto proceedings were begun against the Connecticut charter in 1686, Gov. Dongan sought to have Connecticut subsumed by New York instead. Despite repeated attempts and conversations with Connecticut leaders, Dongan was informed by the General Court of England that it would be impossible and Connecticut would become part of the Dominion. =Governor Fletcher, Governor Bellomont, and the 1700 Order in Council= Following the 1688 Revolution, New York representatives in England continued to press for the annexation of Connecticut and the surrounding New England colonies, emphasizing New York's status as a royal rather than proprietary colony. Locally, private parties continued to dispute claims. In 1692, landowners in Rye and Bedford (New York, per the 1683 agreement) went to Connecticut General Court to seek protection. A month later, in November, some of these men were made to appear in New York courts and ‚Äúacknowledge their fault in making their addresses to the Colony of Connecticut to be taken into that pretended Government.‚Äù In 1693, Gov. Fletcher commanded a Connecticut militia in Hartford as part of an intercolonial defense force called for in the royal commission. Fletcher, by his own admission, was bumptious and bellicose; Fitz- John Winthrop was later able to use this event to remove Fletcher from office in 1697. Before being replaced by Gov. Bellomont, Fletcher referred the dispute to Whitehall. Gov. Bellomont and Gov. Winthrop pressed their respective cases. Winthrop argued that the 1683 agreement was invalid because it had never been ratified in England. But the March 1700 Order in Council sided with New York and the 1683 agreement; the dispute had finally been settled by order of the king. Settling of the boundary A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows the Oblong. From Low's Encyclopaedia. The governments of New York and Connecticut were not quick to effectuate the 1700 Order in Council. Between 1700 and 1717, neither attempted to actually survey and settle the border, leaving the issue to individual landowners. During this time, New York issued patents extending well beyond the boundary, and some New York patent holders even controlled land as far as the Housatonic River. Beginning in 1717, Connecticut began to attempt to survey the line; New York had more trouble securing the appropriate funds because New York's royal patent made new land less profitable to individual citizens. In 1725, in order to effectuate the Order in Council, New York and Connecticut reached a working boundary agreement. The agreement created the Wilton and Ridgefield Angles to better follow the Hudson and to keep as much of Ridgefield in Connecticut as possible, as well as settled on the \\"equivalent land\\" that New York would receive in exchange for the Connecticut panhandle (i.e., the Oblong). The final survey was made and the Oblong was formally signed over by Connecticut in May 1731, ending the territorial dispute between Connecticut and New York. Disputes by and between individual landowners, however, continued. For example, the Philipse family owned all of what is now Putnam County, New York, but did not enforce their ownership of the land within the Oblong, allowing hundreds of squatters to move in, mostly from Connecticut. These settlers were allowed to stay for decades, and a small village even sprung up on the Philipse land (now the hamlet of Patterson, New York). The issue was not resolved until the Philipse's land was confiscated after the Revolution, and the settlers were finally given deeds.

The model is based on the notion that people are evolutionarily predisposed to first assess a stranger's intent to either harm or help them (warmth dimension) and second to judge the stranger‚Äôs capacity to act on that perceived intention (competence dimension). Social groups and individuals that compete for resources (e.g., college admissions space, fresh well water, etc.) with the in-group or self are treated with hostility or disdain. These groups and individuals fall along the low end of the warmth spectrum. While, social groups and individuals with high social status (e.g., economically or educationally successful) are considered competent, and are found at the high end of the competence dimension's spectrum. Thus, lack of perceived threat predicts warmth evaluation and salient status symbols predicts impressions of competence. The model was first proposed by social psychologist Susan Fiske and her colleagues Amy Cuddy, Peter Glick and Jun Xu. Subsequent experimental tests on a variety of national and international samples found the SCM to reliably predict stereotype content in different cultural contexts and affective reactions toward a variety of different groups. The model has also received support in such domains as interpersonal perception. Dimensions = Warmth = Stereotype content model, adapted from Fiske et al. (2002): Four types of stereotypes resulting from combinations of perceived warmth and competence.Appraisals of warmth have a greater impact on interpersonal and intergroup relations than appraisals of competence. Warmth is, therefore, the primary dimension within the SCM. Assessments of an out-group or individual's potential threat level predicts the group or person's place along the warmth dimension's high/low spectrum. From an evolutionary perspective warmth is primary because having a keen understanding of a person‚Äôs competency is not as relevant if you already know that they are not trying to harm you. Early versions of the SCM predicted that intergroup or interpersonal competition drove ratings of warmth (low competition ‚Üí high warmth; high competition ‚Üí low warmth). In 2015, Kervyn, Fiske, and Yzerbyt expanded the SCM's original definition of threat also include to symbolic threats, based on Kinder and Sears (1981) Symbolic Racism theory, which steams from in-group fears over perceived threats to culture or value norms. In the same paper, Kervyn, Fiske, and Yzerbyt also broadened their concept of warmth and defined it as an umbrella term that encompasses both sociability and morality. This reconceptualization of warmth responded to earlier work by Leach, Ellemers, and Barreto (2007) who argued that the warmth dimension conflated two variables (1) sociability, which describes attributes such as cooperation and kindness, and (2) morality, describing an internal ethical sense. They proposed an alternative three dimension model, which retained competence and divides warmth into morality and sociability. Their plea for the importance of morality in intergroup perception was also echoed by Brambilla et al. (2011) and Brambilla et al. (2012). In addition to broadening the definition of warmth to include morality, Kervyn, Fiske, and Yzerbyt also countered that early theoretical definitions of warmth had, in fact, included adjectives related to morality even though morality measures were not included when warmth was later operationalized during empirical tests. = Competence = People or groups who appear \\"high in status\\" are judged as more competent than those with low status. The competence dimension definition and prediction on the bases of status has been robust in the literature, and as such, has not faced the same criticism as the warmth dimension. Durante et al. (2013) cross- cultural review of the literature reported an average correlation between status and competence of r = .9 (range = .74‚Äì.99, all p‚Äôs < .001).  Historical Background  Prejudice has been deconstructed and debated by social psychologists for over eight decades. Early stereotype research, exemplified by the work of Gordon Allport (1954), concentrated on negative stereotypes within a binary in-group/out-group model. In contrast to prior ‚Äúus‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthem‚Äù approaches, the SCM's 2x2 framework created new room for mixed out-group orientations i.e. groups stereotyped to be low warmth/high competence and low competence/high warmth. The multiple out-group categories accounted for a wider variety of out-group directed treatment than prior work. The SCM broke from former research literature with a mixed stereotype approach that formalized multiple out-group categories. However, the model's dimensions - warmth and competence - have a long history in psychology literature. In particular, Rosenberg, Nelson, and Vivekananthan's 1968 theory of social judgments, which included social (good/bad) and intellectual (good/bad), was an early version of the warmth competence dimensions. Fiske et al. (2002), also credited their decision to adopt a dual warmth/competence model to a 1997 study from Bogdan Wojciszke‚Äôs laboratory, which found that warmth and competence accounted for 82% of the variance in social perceptions of daily behaviors.  Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) Map  To further develop the SCM, Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick (2007) tested a causal model of stereotype development in each of the SCM's four quadrants, which linked social structure (environmental context) to the development of new cognitive explanations (stereotypes), which then provoke affect (emotion), and ultimately lead to action tendencies (behavior). The researchers refer to the integrated behavioral and stereotype content model framework as the behaviors from intergroup affect and stereotypes (BIAS) map. The BIAS map‚Äôs behavioral action tendencies include an active/passive spectrum and harm/facilitation spectrum. The active/passive spectrum distinguishes behaviors that are either intentionally directed at the out-group (active) or behaviors that affect the out-group but do not require noticeable effort (passive). The second behavior spectrum, harm/facilitation, is included in the BIAS Map to differentiate out- groups that the in-group is positioned to either assist or to harm. Each stereotype group quadrant is assigned two behavioral tendencies. Thus, common cultural stereotypes dictate if a social group will either be on the receiving end of cooperative behavior (active or passive) or be subjected to harmful behavior (active or passive). = The BIAS Map Quadrants =  1) (High) Warmth / (High) Competence  * Emotion: Admiration * Behavior: Active facilitation * Description: The in-group, i.e., the group to which an observer personally belongs, close allies, and societal reference groups (e.g., cultural default groups such as the middle class, heterosexuals) tend to be rated as high on both dimensions. However, there are differences between in- group perceptions between Western and Eastern cultures, with only Western cultures displaying this in-group favoritism.  2) (High) Warmth / (Low) Competence  * Emotion: Pity * Behavior: Passive facilitation * Description: According to stereotype surveys conducted in the U.S., some commonly pitied out-groups include the elderly and mentally disabled. Out- groups that are pitied are within the in-group‚Äôs moral framework, but are often isolated from society. As an example, the elderly, who are pitied, will either receive passive harm, often in the form of isolation in nursing homes, or active facilitation displayed through elderly charities or community service.  3) (Low) Warmth / (High) Competence  * Emotion: Envy * Behavior: Passive harm * Description: Out groups that are seen as lacking warmth and possessing high competency will evoke envy. Studies on US stereotypes identified wealthy Americans, Asian Americans, and members in the Jewish community in the high competency/low warmth out-group category.  4) (Low) Warmth / (Low) Competence  * Emotion: Contempt * Behavior: Active harm * Description: Out-groups that are appraised with low warmth and low competency are subject to the greatest amount of hostility. Groups that are subjected to the low/low category commonly include the homeless and welfare recipients.  Warmth and Competence Interactions  = Warmth and Competence as Distinct Dimensions = Warmth and competence are conceptually orthogonal, i.e. non overlapping, and correspondingly a high rating in one dimension can be companied with either a low or high definition in the other dimension without triggering cognitive dissonance. Warmth and competence also function separately within an individual's ego defense mechanism. A 2009 study by Collange, Fiske and Sanitioso found that when participants' own competence was threatened they were more likely to degrade (or diminish) their perceptions of target group members who had (high)competence (low)warmth stereotypes. This study supports the claim that ego defense mechanisms are dimension specific; if a person experiences a threat to their level of competence they will reduced their rating of others stereotyped to be highly competent, but will not downgrade their perception of those groups stereotyped to be high on warmth. = The Warmth/Competence Trade Off = Despite conceptual independence, appraisals of warmth and competence are not fully independent. A 2005 experimental study by Judd et al. reported a trade off between high and low assessments of warmth and competence when directly comparing the relative attributed of two social groups. When the study's participants read a profile about one group, which described them as high in one dimension (e.g. warmth) the study subjects increased their appraisal of the comparison group along the alternative dimension (e.g. competence). Thus there is a tendency toward ambivalent stereotypes when comparing social groups' relative warmth and competence.  Warmth and Competence in Other Disciplines  Studies on warmth and competence have had a large impact in social psychology and quickly touched upon related academic fields such as Management Studies or Advertisement. The concepts have also found application in the field of International Relations to explore inter-state engagements, with an article suggesting that in public diplomacy (where sovereign states enact relationships with foreign publics), states perceive foreign publics based on dimensions which are akin to warmth and competence: States fathom whether foreign stakeholders warrant caution based on their strategic importance (in parallel to warmth), and whether these publics possess resources that are favourable to the policy-makers' objectives (in parallel to competence).

While initially a speed metal band, its musical style has been variously described as progressive metal, grindcore and jazz. Common themes in band's music are horror film creatures, hyperbolic sexual fetishes and Chilean myths. Its frontman, Rodrigo Cuadra, became a TV presenter in the 1990s. Biography =Early years (1984‚Äî1988)= Dorso was formed in 1984 by Rodrigo Cuadra, who was 17 at the time. His vision for the band was for it to be a musical synthesis of extreme metal and progressive rock, drawing extensively from dark fantasy literature and gore films for inspiration. Dorso made its first public gig in a √ëu√±oa gym in 1984, with a setlist of heavy metal covers and original songs. By the time of the release of their first demo, Parajes de lo Desconocido (1985), Dorso was a trio led by its original frontman and two new hires, Gamal Eltit in guitars and Jaime Palma in drums. =1989‚Äî1995= Their first album, Bajo una luna c√°mbrica, was released in 1989. It featured an eclectic blend of prog rock-inspired thrash metal, retrospectively described as progressive metal, odd time signatures and traditional speed metal. The second album, Romance (1990) is considered by many as one of the best of the band. Eltit and the newly hired drummer Eduardo Topelberg left the band citing musical disagreements after recording Romance. Two new members joined the band, ex-Nimrod Marcelo Naves in drums and guitarist Alvaro Soms. This line-up went on to record Dorso's best-selling album to date, El Espanto Surge de la Tumba (1993). The album's heavy use of Spanglish, black humor and bilingual puns, as well as Soms' distinctive riff- writing became the defining characteristics of the band's sound. Their next album, Big Monsters Aventura was released to some success in 1995, with the eponymous song being featured on MTV's Headbangers Ball. This album featured more goregrind elements than its predecessor. =Dorso now (since 1998)= Following the release Disco Blood in 1998, the band went on to release 2 live albums followed by a short hiatus and the return of Eltit in guitars. In 2008 the band released Espacium, and in 2012 Recolecciones Macabras del Campo Chileno, featuring for the first time some doom and black metal elements, with lyrical themes revolving around Chilean myths and legends.

Biography Bob Mizer‚Äôs earliest photographs appeared in 1942, in both color and black and white, but his career was catapulted into infamy in 1947 when he was convicted of the unlawful distribution of obscene material through the US mail. The material in question was a series of black and white photographs, taken by Mizer, of young bodybuilders wearing what were known as posing straps‚Äîa precursor to the G-string. He served a nine-month prison sentence at a work camp in Saugus, California, for what now seems tame. At the time, male near- nudity was not only frowned upon, but illegal. In spite of societal expectations and pressure from law enforcement, Mizer built a veritable empire on his beefcake photographs and films. He established the influential studio, the Athletic Model Guild (AMG) in 1945, but by the time he published the first issue of Physique Pictorial he was operating the studio on his own at his home near downtown Los Angeles. He photographed thousands of men, building a collection that includes nearly two million different images and thousands of films and videotapes.Hanson, Dian, 2009.

In the 1950s, several other photographers were doing similar work, such as Alonzo Hanagan in New York City, Douglas of Detroit, Don Whitman of Western Photography Guild in Denver, and, on the West Coast, Russ Warner in Oakland and Dave Martin in San Francisco. Regardless of the attempts to suppress his work, Mizer continued to pursue his vision, influencing artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and David Hockney.\\"Beyond Beefcake in the Work of a Gay Pioneer\\", The New York Times, January 10, 2014 Over time he captured on film the career beginnings of a number of soon-to-be Hollywood actors, including Glenn Corbett, Tab Hunter, Robert Harrison, Dennis Cole and others. Examples of Mizer's work are now held by esteemed educational and cultural institutions the world over, and can be found in various books, galleries, and private art collections. New York University‚Äôs 80 Washington Square East Gallery presented what it called \\"the first major institutional solo presentation of Bob Mizer‚Äôs work to be shown anywhere in the world\\" in early 2014, where artists Bruce Yonemoto, Karen Finley and Vaginal Davis added to NYU's scholarship on Mizer. The New York Times reported that the exhibition \\"makes a good case for [Mizer] as an artist with interests and imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests.\\" In 1999, Beefcake, a docudrama directed by Thom Fitzgerald, was produced, inspired by a picture book by F. Valentine Hooven III (published by Taschen). Films Bob Mizer produced over 3,000 film titles from the early 1950s to the early 1980s. In August 1980, he began using the then-new technology of VHS, and recorded over 7500 hours of his photo sessions until his death in 1992. =Partial filmography= *Advice Without Consent (1955) *Alladin (1956) *Andy & The Angry Mummy (1963) *Motorcycle Thief (1958) *Love 2001 (1970) *Joe Dallesandro Posing (1966) *Tijuana Bandit (1964) References Further reading * Padva, Gilad. \\"Nostalgic Physique: Displaying Foucauldian Muscles and Celebrating the Male Body in Beefcake\\".

Early life  On May 9, 2003, Washington pleaded guilty to prohibitive sexual conduct after having consensual sex with his sister, Caylen. At the time, he was 16, and she was 15. Washington was processed as an adult and put in jail; he was released after one month. As a result of the charge, he is a registered sex offender.  High School and College career  Washington played one year of high school football as a junior while living in New Orleans. That year, he was awarded with all-league honors as a member of the Alcee Fortier High School football team. His family moved to Texas after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. After graduating from high school, Washington did not plan to attend college. He decided to go to college, however, after a car salesman suggested he continue his football career. He then enrolled at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas. While at Trinity Valley, Washington was named to the 2007 all-Southwest Junior College Football Conference first team. Washington then attended Abilene Christian University, playing on the football team for two years. Both years he was voted the Lone Star Conference Offensive Lineman of the Year.  Professional career  Though Washington excelled at the NFL Scouting Combine workouts he was undrafted. He was very agile and quick for a lineman, running the 40-yard dash in 5.09 seconds. After leaving school, Washington played for the Dallas Vigilantes of the Arena Football League (AFL) for two years before signing with the Calgary Stampeders in 2011. He was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on July 4, 2012, where he won his first Grey Cup. Washington was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos from the Argos in May 2014. In his first three seasons in Edmonton he started in 48 games for the club, including the 2015 Grey Cup championship victory. Following the 2016 season Washington signed a contract extension with the Eskimos. He was released by Edmonton on August 7, 2017, and was immediately signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. On July 22, 2018 Washington was traded with teammate Landon Rice to the Montreal Alouettes in the blockbuster Johnny Manziel deal.

Designed by George McCree and E. J. Frost, and later redesigned by Robert Foulis. Foulis, an early professional at Town & Country Club who was recommended to the membership by C.B. MacDonald. Club history As the first ‚Äúcountry club‚Äù in Minnesota, Town & Country Club was founded as a social organization inspired by the clubs in Saint Paul that were formed as a nucleus of the annual Winter Carnival. A residence on Lake Como was used as the first clubhouse in 1887. The Club moved in 1890 to its present home at the Marshall Avenue Bridge on the Saint Paul side of the Mississippi River. Today, this ‚Äúcountry club‚Äù is in the heart of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, but in 1890, it was in the far reaches of Saint Paul. The original Town & Country Club, a Saint Paul landmark, was designed by state capitol architect, Cass Gilbert, and built in the early 1890s for $25,000. The first round of golf in Minnesota was played at the Town & Country Club of Saint Paul in 1893. Golf began here as an afterthought. George McCree, a transplanted Scot, had migrated to Minnesota from Canada and was familiar with the game of golf. An early member recalled, ‚ÄúI took McCree out to the Club with my lawn mower in the back of my roadster to help lay out the course. Using an old driver and a twenty-five cent gutta percha ball, after a couple shots, McCree marked a spot with a stake - 'This is the first hole,' he said. In this fashion, the first five holes were laid out.\\" In 1895, E. J. Frost, a well-known amateur out of Chicago, was hired to lay out Town & Country Club‚Äôs first nine holes with the help of Charles B. Macdonald and Henry James Whigham. In 1897, $2,000.00 was budgeted to lay out the new course. On June 9, 1898, the new nine holes were opened for play. Also at this time, Robert Foulis, the first golf pro and expert maker of clubs, was acquired from St. Andrew‚Äôs Golf Club. The first greens keeper was also engaged at this time. Town & Country Club's golf course is the second oldest golf course in the United States still being played on its original land, behind only Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in New York. Town & Country Club is one of the first 25 member clubs of the United States Golf Association and is a founding member of the Western Golf Association.

When perfectly pure, the interface between fluids usually displays only surface tension. But when surfactants are adsorbed on the interface, because they lower the surface tension, the stress within the interface is affected by the flow for several reasons. * Change in the surface concentration of surfactants when the in-plane flow tends to alter the surface area of the interface (Gibbs' elasticity). * Adsorption/desorption of the surfactants to/from the interface.  Importance of surface rheology  The mechanical properties (rheology) of dispersed media such as liquid foams and emulsions is strongly affected by surface rheology. Indeed, when, they consist in two (or more) fluid phases, deforming the material implies deforming the constitutive phases (bubbles, drops) and thus their interfaces. The measurement of surface rheological properties is described by storage and loss moduli. In the case of a linear response to a sinusoidal deformation, the loss modulus is the product of the viscosity by the frequency. One of the difficulties of surface rheology measurements come from the fact that the adsorbed layers are usually rather compressible (at the difference of bulk fluids which are essentially incompressible), and both compression and shear parameters should be determined. This determination requires different type of instruments, for instance oscillating drops for the compression properties and oscillating bicones for the shear properties. These two methods allow investigating the variation of the parameters upon the amplitude of the deformation. This is very useful as the responses of adsorbed layers to deformations are frequently non-linear.

Background On 25 March 1746 a French ship named the Le Prince Charles, formerly HMS Hazard, which carried ¬£13,000 in gold, arms and other supplies to Inverness for the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart ran into the Kyle of Tongue while being pursued by the British frigate . During the night the crew and soldiers disembarked carrying the money, however the following day Captain George Mackay, son of the chief of the Clan Mackay, who supported the British government confronted them at a place named Drum Nan Coup and after a short fight Mackay captured the men and the money. The battle An account of the fight was reported in the London Gazette of 15 April 1746: > Aberdeen, April 6. Captain Mackay, Lord Reay's son, and Sir Henry Munro, son > of the late Sir Robert, both Captains in Lord Loudon's regiment, are just > come hither with letters from Captain O'Brian of Sheerness man of war, now > off this place giving an account that after chasing the Le Prince Charles > above 56 leagues he drove her ashore and obliged the French and Spaniards > who were in her to quit her and to land, which they did with five chests of > money to the value of ¬£12,000 and upwards, in order to join the rebels; but > the Lord Reay (Mackay) in whose country they were landed and whose house > Captain Mackay, Sir Henry Munro, Lord [?Captain] Charles Gordon, and Captain > MacLeod with some others of Lord Loudon's regiment were, with about 80 men > of said regiment, who had been driven thither by the rebels, marched out and > attacked them, and after killing three or four, and dangerously wounding > eight, took the remaining 156, officers, soldiers, and sailors prisoners, > who were immediately embarked on board the Sheerness, and the prize with the > Highland officers and men who made the capture are now here.....The money > that was landed out of the Hazard sloop, was taken by Lord Reay's men. Aftermath and significance Historian Ruairi MacLeod gives details of what was done with the money captured from the Jacobites. Captain George Mackay, Sir Harry Munro, Lord Charles Gordon, John MacLeod, Lieutenant Reid, and Ensign MacLaggan all received ¬£700 each of the captured booty. Ensign Aneas Mackay received ¬£200. Lieutenant Daniel Forbes received ¬£100. The sergeants each received ¬£50 and the privates each got ¬£7 or ¬£8 which was the equivalent to eight or nine months pay. Historian Angus Mackay in the Book of Mackay writes of the significance of the Skirmish of Tongue as having more to do with the overthrow of Charles Edward Stuart at Culloden than is generally realized by the fact that money and supplies had been cut off that were destined for the Jacobites. In the aftermath of the conflict at Tongue the Mackays continued to fight against the Jacobite rebels in the Highlands, defeating the Jacobite Mackenzie, Earl of Cromarty at the Battle of Littleferry.

Ibragimov, who was reportedly drunk, then went through the village and shot those whom he recognized as being Russians, while sparing those who were Chechens.

He was raised in Falls Church, Virginia and had three siblings. At age ten he started a business designing and selling greeting cards, raising enough money and winning a scholarship to attend the University of Virginia beginning in 1981. In college he studied Biophysics and Chemical Engineering, and supported himself by designing campus posters, T-shirts, and greeting cards, working as a staff political cartoonist for the Cavalier Daily and University Journal, and working summer jobs at the Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. He also served on the University of Virginia‚Äôs Honor Council and as an officer for the Virginia chapter of Delta Upsilon fraternity. During his undergraduate study, an engineering professor criticized his excessive doodling and unnecessary language in his lab notes, promptly Gerber to enroll in a fiction writing class in his final year, his only A+ grade of his entire college career. For his writing class he produced his first short story, A Fishing Day Correspondence, later published in The Virginia Quarterly Review, in 1985. Gerber did not write another work of fiction again until twenty years later. Gerber applied for and was rejected by Harvard Business School in 1987. Upon his second attempt at admission he did not complete the required personal essays in the application forms but instead constructed a large painted wooden puzzle of a pictogram detailing his life and accomplishments and shipped it to Harvard Admissions in a Zip-Loc bag. Gerber was accepted in Harvard University‚Äôs School of Business and graduated in 1992.

At first her name was \\"Mal√π\\", but the most fitting Ramba was launched by a journalist as he was referring to her aggressive look with guns and magazines. She has appeared in many films. Biography Carusio studied singing and then worked as a model and fashion model. She began her career as a porn star after a meeting a man in Genoa, Riccardo Schicchi, founder and manager of the agency \\"Diva Futura\\"; she was the first actress to join the agency in 1983. Her statuesque beauty of the Mediterranean type guaranteed her success almost immediately. In 1986 Carusio participated in the live show,delicious curves, alongside to Cicciolina, Moana Pozzi and Cornelia Oltean. The show was an incredible success, but her innumerable controversies caused a legal trial for a complaint of obscenity which ended with a sentence of six months and a fine for Riccardo Schicchi and the actresses. She made her film debut in 1987, in Abat-jour, a soft-core film directed by Lorenzo Onorati and in which she was the main actress alongside Aldo Sambrell and Baby Pozzi. Carusio retired around 1990, (apparently because of pressure from her Catholic family). Then, she rejoined the world of cinema with her previous name Mal√π, and she played in five erotic films since then.  Other Ramba  Riccardo Schicchi, perhaps disappointed by the resignation of Ramba just at the time of greatest success, has revived the Ramba name and around 1990, a new model with a nationality of French and Super Ramba, a model from Hungary was introduced in 1992.

Its offices were in Paris, Warsaw, and Bydgoszcz. Its manager in chief was a Frenchman, Charles Laurent. In the early 1920s, the Polish government decided to construct a rail line connecting Polish part of Upper Silesia with Baltic Sea coast. The Polish Coal Trunk-Line was one of the biggest investments of the Second Polish Republic, and its construction, until 1930, was funded by the government. However, the Great Depression caused growing budget problems for the Polish State Railways, and completion of the line was questioned. Under the circumstances, the Polish government decided that the newly created French-Polish Rail Association would take over construction of the middle sector of the line. The Association was officially created on April 21, 1931, in Paris. Its shareholders were the Polish Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and the French Banque des Pays du Nord, as well as industrial giant Schneider et Creusot, which since 1924 had been part of a French‚ÄìPolish Consortium for construction of the port in Gdynia. Furthermore, Schneider et Creusot was a shareholder of some Upper Silesian coal mines and steel plants, and for these reasons, the corporation was vividly interested in completion of the line. Founder‚Äôs capital was 15 million French francs. The French-Polish Rail Association took over construction of the following sectors of the line: * Herby Nowe - Inowroc≈Çaw, * Nowa Wie≈õ Wielka - Bydgoszcz Wsch√≥d Towarowa - Gdynia Port. Additionally, FPTK began construction of a line Chorzew Siemkowice - Czƒôstochowa, which was finished in April 1939. It joined the Polish Coal Trunk-Line with the industrial city of Czƒôstochowa. The Association was granted the use of the line for 40 years; however, the Polish government assured the right to buy the line after 20 years. In the agreement, the Poles made sure that during construction, Polish workers would be employed, and Polish material would be used. Trains of the Polish State Railways were allowed to use the line without restrictions. Military and mail transports were granted the same privileges as they enjoyed on all government-owned lines. To finance all projects, the Association took a loan from a French bank, with the Polish government as a voucher. On Wednesday, March 1, 1933, the 156-kilometer segment Zdu≈Ñska Wola Karsznice - Inowroc≈Çaw was opened, which resulted in immediate opening of rail cargo traffic along the whole line. The opening ceremony took place at the newly built rail station at Karsznice, and it was broadcast by the Polish Radio. The line, with double track along its route, was not completely ready until 1937. Due to a lack of finances needed to buy rail engines and cars, from 1933 to 1937, FPTK allowed Polish Railways to temporarily use the Trunk Line, until January 1, 1938, when the line was handed back to the Association. The national budget of Poland yielded an annual profit of 12 million zlotys from taxes and dividends from use of the line. In August 1938, in order to assure closer cooperation with authority of the port of Gdynia, FPTK became part of The Council of the Port. In the 1930s, general manager of the Association was a Frenchman Charles Laurent, and his deputy - Julian Piasecki. Since 1936, general office of FPTK was located in the office building in Bydgoszcz, which had been the headquarters of the Prussian Eastern Railway.

The nature of that coordination has led some scholars to conclude that the seeming interracial union activity was in fact bi-racial: a well-organized plan of parallel concerted activity with coordination and support between the groups, but with a clear divide along racial lines. Under this framework, cooperation was seen less a matter of ideological interracial solidarity among the working class and more a matter of pragmatism so that the working conditions of each distinct group would improve.Eric Arnesen, \\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers, ed. Calvin Winslow, University of Illinois Press, Chicago (1998) (p. 23). As discussed below, several factors may have allowed bi-racial union efforts to succeed at the port of New Orleans, including (a) the independent strength of the blackFor the sake of consistency throughout, this Article uses the racial descriptors \\"black\\" and \\"white.\\" Other possible descriptors for those groups include Black, African-American, White, and Caucasian. No implication or inference should be drawn as a result of the terms chosen in this Article. unions that compelled whites to enter into collaborative agreements with them; (b) the prior history of racial division or segmentation of labor; (c) the relative power of employers to control jobs; and (d) overall employment relations.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 47). Because dock work was generally unskilled (with the notable exception of screwmen) and of a short-term contractual nature, an employer could readily replace workers who refused to bend to the employer's terms. Black laborers were both numerous and available for work. In this type of competitive market, blacks and whites were pitted against each other by ship owners in an effort to keep wages down: if whites would not work for a lower wage, owners would look to blacks who would.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 26). Following this reasoning, \\"[o]nly control of the labor supply and solidarity across trade and racial lines could reduce this possibility. That meant that alliances between unions and, most importantly, between black and white unions, were essential to reducing competition between different groups for jobs.\\"\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 26). Alliances between the groups allowed both to exercise more control over the terms and conditions of their work, including wage rates and production expectations. Union leaders of both races recognized the difference that an alliance made in those terms and conditions, prompting a pragmatic continuation of the biracial system. 50-50 or Half-and-Half New Orleans dockworkers maintained a long-standing tradition known as \\"50-50\\" or \\"half- and-half.\\" Under this arrangement, both black and white workers insisted that any work crew hired by ship owners be 50% black and 50% white. Workers would labor side by side, performing the same work for the same pay. This was generally seen as a way to prevent employers from undermining one group by playing to the other: both black and white union leaders recognizes that when blacks and whites were hired in alternating groups as they were in the mid-1890s, unions weakened and race riots or other tensions could ‚Äì and did ‚Äì flare up.Rosenberg, Daniel, New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 SUNY Press, Albany (1988) (pp. 69, 71); Arnesen, Eric, Waterfront Workers of New Orleans: Race, Class, and Politics Oxford University Press, New York (1991) (pp. 143-44). In October 1901 the separate black and white unions created a Dock and Cotton Council that overarched unions of black and white screwmen, longshoremen, teamsters, loaders, and other work classifications at the waterfront. Leadership positions on the Council were generally divided according to the 50-50 system, with the presidency and financial secretary position held by white workers and the vice-presidency and corresponding secretary position held by black workers. Committee positions were similarly assigned.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p.73). By 1903, the Council oversaw eight separate unions of black and white dockworkers with a total of approximately 10,000 members and helped ensure that all unions adhered to the 50-50 rule.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 74). Over time, it also assisted the member unions in negotiations with employers and were kept informed of the unions' organizational and racial relationships. As the overarching union body, the Council was also empowered to call for a general port strike.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 74). Limits On Racial Cooperation Both black and white unions insisted that they had no interracial equality or ideological leanings.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 23). Black workers announced that they wanted a stable waterfront, not social equality with white men, and did not want to be used by employers to drive a wedge between the races.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 30). The structure and operation of the Dock and Cotton Council has also been seen as racially stratified by some scholars. Although black and whites were elected equally to officer positions and conference committees, and work operated under the 50-50 system, white workers consistently held the presidency and were the only ones allowed to hold foreman positions. Black workers vehemently protested their exclusion from foreman jobs, but faced resistance from white waterfront laborers who did not want to take orders from a black man. In order to preserve the overall alliance, black unions retreated from the foreman controversy.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 31). Screwmen New Orleans screwmen were responsible for tightly compressing and packing cotton bales into the holds of ships. This critical task put them at the top of the labor force on the docks and allowed them to insist on the highest wages; their work was highly skilled, required immense strength, and was indispensable to the smooth operation of the waterfront. However, in contrast to other waterfront laborers, white screwmen had resisted cooperation with their black counterparts. In the 1880s, the white screwmen refused the 50-50 arrangements and voted for a quota system that allowed only 20 black screwmen crews per day.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 27). Another account put the limit at 100 black screwmen at any one time.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 82). The locals had separate contracts with different terms, and there was no way to support workers in labor disputes. In addition, rumors began to spread that shipping agents were trying to find ways to remove the 75-bale per day limit instituted by white screwmen by using black screwmen who would work for lower wages with no limit on bales stowed.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 125-26). A black shipping company also emerged.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 125). Such types of racial divisions led to riots in the mid-1890s as black screwmen attacked their white counterparts, whites responded with equal violence, and numerous deaths resulted.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 27); Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (pp. 127-29). By the turn of the twentieth century, however, screwmen of both races faced new pressures and demands from employers with the advent of new shipping technologies, larger ship size, and the shippers' search for non-union labor.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 122). Now, \\"speed, not skill, was central to profitability.\\"\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 28). In part as a response to the high wages that screwmen commanded (regardless of how many bales were stowed) and the results of cooperation between black and white workers overall on the waterfront, employers introduced a new system of loading known as 'shoot-the-chute.' This system required crews of 4 to 5 men to throw down between 400 and 700 bales or more of cotton per day into the holds of the ships where other workers waited to pack them.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 163). Moreover, in contrast to earlier years, no limit was placed on the number of bales required to constitute a day's work ‚Äì men would work until told to stop, not until they reached a set number of bales. There was also concern that the faster pace would mean that there would be less work left for subsequent days, leaving workers idle (and unpaid).New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 83). The definition of a fair day's work was central to the dispute, and in April 1902 the employers' Steamship Conference declared that (1) the employer had the right to direct where employees work; (2) that the employer's orders must be obeyed, even if the employer's agent was not a union member; (3) only Conference members could determine the \\"character of the stowage of the cotton\\"; and (4) the employer had the right to expect as much work as could reasonably be done.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 166). Both black and white screwmen fiercely resisted shoot-the-chute and the lower working conditions it represented for them, as well as the Conference's view of a day's work. In order to effectively stand against their employers, the two screwmen unions agreed to a uniform wage scale in April 1902.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 28). This contract also provided for equal work distribution among black and white screwmen, but forbade them from engaging in sympathy strikes or striking for higher wages.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 82-83). As scholar Eric Arnesen analyzed the situation, \\"white workers reasoned accurately that success lay in reducing all possible divisions between black and white workers and preventing a revival of a split labor market on the docks.\\"\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 28). Black screwmen found a somewhat different reason for joining with their white counterparts, namely, a sense that they were being unfairly used by owners as a way to attack the white workers and starve them out of work ‚Äì and being paid lower wages in the process.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 28). In the fall of 1902, the black and white screwmen unions agreed that they would present all demands to employers jointly, renew the 50-50 work-sharing agreement from the spring, and maintain mixed-race work crews. Embracing 50-50 even further, they insisted that they would not recognize a foreman who was not a member of either the black or white screwmen's union.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 29). Moreover, 100 to 120 bales of cotton would be a day's work ‚Äì not the 400 and 700 demanded under shoot-the-chute.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 83); Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 164). The screwmen's alliance was deemed generally successful and firmly adhered to by both black and white unions. From 1902 through 1903, they launched a series of strikes (and responding lockouts from employers) that ended in the realization of their production rate and 50-50 demands. Notably, the screwmen enjoyed the backing of other waterfront unions ‚Äì both black and white ‚Äì and the newly formed Dock and Cotton Council.\\"Biracial Waterfront Unionism\\" in Waterfront Workers (p. 29); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 83-84). The first strike began on November 3, 1902 when screwmen struck all employers who did not adhere to the new joint contract demands. Despite the fact that employers accused black unions of breaking the terms in their earlier separate contract and threatened them, the strike remained united and ended in early December 1902; by December 25, screwmen were packing on average 110 bales per day.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 85). In response to the screwmen's success, employers instituted two lockouts in 1903, again centering on the shoot-the-chute system and the required number of bales that screwmen would have to stow. In April, employers demanded no limits on the number of bales stowed, the end of 50-50, restoration of shoot-the-chute, and a restoration of the power to give work assignments.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 85); Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 166). When both black and white workers refused and described the demand as \\"so objectionable and so inimical\\" that they could not accept,Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 167). they were locked out for approximately three weeks. Negotiations continued through the spring and summer, with employers agreeing on 50-50 but insisting on the higher pace and threatening to move work elsewhere. Although rumors of a split between the black and white unions surfaced, no break actually occurred.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 87-88). With no contract by September and no definition of a fair day's work, workers worked at their own pace and, again, the black and white unions affirmed their cooperation.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 167). The screwmen were again locked out on October 1, 1903, this time supported by black and white longshoremen. Shippers filed several lawsuits and restraining orders against the screwmen, and city leaders (including Mayor Paul Capdevielle) unsuccessfully attempted to mediate.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 168). Scholar Daniel Rosenberg noted that even imported strikebreakers sometimes quit when they learned of the lockout and both protests and violence rapidly broke out.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 88-89). Ultimately, the two-week lockout ended when employers proposed terms requiring screwmen to produce 160 hand-stowed bales per day. After intense debate in a joint meeting of the black and white screwmen, the proposal was accepted and the shipping lines admitted defeat.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 168). Shippers experienced more than $400,000 in losses while screwmen lost $50,000 in wages and prevented any bales of cotton from leaving the port of New Orleans between October 1 and October 10, 1903.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 90). The 1907 General Levee Strike In the autumn of 1907, both black and white longshore workers launched an extended general strike against their shipping company employers.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 196); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 115). As in 1902-03, screwmen were the focus of the initial conflict, which one scholar identifies as resentment on the part of shippers and steamship agents that the screwmen (and other dockworkers) had nearly seized complete control over their terms of work and won the 160-per-day bale limit.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 196). When the 1903 contract expired on September 1, 1907, employers employed a 'parity' argument, demanding that New Orleans screwmen stow as much cotton as their counterparts in Galveston, Texas ‚Äì a rate which employers initially claimed to be 200 bales per day but quickly escalated to what scholars peg at 240, or even 300 bales per day.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 196); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 119-20). On October 4, all of the shipping lines locked out the screwmen, black and white alike. Pursuant to a call from the Dock and Cotton Council, 9,000 dockworkers, black and white, struck the New Orleans port that evening in a show of solidarity with the screwmen.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 121-22). Freight handlers from the Southern Pacific line also struck, ending any work on the port.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 122). Individual black and white waterfront unions reinforced the Council's message, asking their members to stay away from the ports, insisting that they would hold firm across racial lines, and noting that if the employers played one racial group against the other, they would all face starvation wages.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 123). Employers responded by immediately bringing in thousands of black and white strikebreakers. During the first week of the strike, the breakers unloaded freight trains and stowed cotton. Although some crews worked at a 200 bale per day rate, they could not keep up that rate and were considered by some to be less efficient than expected.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 125). Some of the replacements quit when they learned they were being used as strikebreakers, and others quit in response to the protests of the New Orleans waterfront workers.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 125-127). The families of dockworkers also confronted strikebreakers, as did some members of the strikebreakers' own families who felt solidarity with the dockworkers.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 131-33). Yet the New Orleans strikers remained generally peaceful.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 126). During the second week of the strike, employers launched strong attempts to create a racial break among the black and white strikers. Some employers began calling for an end to the screwman trade altogether (to be replaced by general dock labor); a combination of events that led some observers to conclude that the employers' goal was not to reach settlement but rather to destroy the screwmen's union.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (pp. 197-98); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 122-23). They also appealed to the non-screwmen, noting that they were losing wages over a battle that was not their own. Shippers also revived the White League, a group designed to intimidate black strikers. Despite the attempts, strikers remained united.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 127-28). On October 11, black and white screwmen proposed a return to work at the rate of 160 bales per day, pending an investigation into port charges and conditions. The New Orleans mayor endorsed this proposal, but employers refused and insisted on the 200 bale per day rate. In turn, the screwmen rejected the employers' demand and held to the 160 bale rate.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 128-29). During this process, rumors began to spread claiming that the black and white screwmen had begun to splinter, as had the unity between the screwmen and the other waterfront job classification; however, no split materialized.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 128). Instead, the union agreed that it would accept the mayor's proposal of 180 bales per day on the condition that this rate stand as a final settlement, pending no further action or investigation. This was rejected by management, and prompted claims in the newspapers that the workers were inflexible.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 129-30). The general strike ended on October 24, 1907 with a compromise plan endorsed and urged by the city's mayor, who was under pressure due to ongoing financial losses resulting from the disruption of work.New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 133-34). Under the proposal, screwmen would agree to return to work at the rate of 180 bales per day pending binding arbitration of their conflict; shipping agents reluctantly agreed as well.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (pp. 198-99). In response to union demands, the agreement also included provisions for an investigation into the port's viability and conditions based on workers' allegations that they were unfairly being blamed for general economic and trade problems.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 199). Racial divisions quickly formed as the screwmen appointed their representatives to the investigatory committee along the 50-50 principle ‚Äì and white ship owners refused to work with the black representatives.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 199-200); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (pp. 135-38). After no resolution could be reached, the mayor and Louisiana governor Newton C. Blanchard instructed the state assembly to form a five-person committee to investigate all charges and regulations affecting the New Orleans port, including labor and related elements.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 200); New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923 (p. 140-41). This committee began work in January 1908 and continued through mid-May of the same year. A particular focus was the nature of cross-racial action; they viewed the screwmen's 50-50 rule as undesirable, particularly as it risked fostering what they considered inappropriate social equality. White supremacy rhetoric also existed, but although the commission called for an end to cross-racial cooperation, the workers ignored the instructions and the commission could not enforce their position.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (pp. 200-202). Ultimately, the commissioners concluded that labor was not overpaid and worked under the same conditions as their counterparts in other locations. On the question of bale- rate, it ruled that 187 bales of loose cotton per work crew would constitute a day's work.Waterfront Workers of New Orleans (p. 202).

It was built on the Waterloo to Reading Line. It opened in 1918 and was closed by British Railways on 6 January 1969. Part of the site is now being rebuilt to stable Class 701 EMUs for South Western Railway (SWR). History During the early years of the twentieth century the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) experienced a substantial growth in its freight traffic to and from London, and for transfer to other railways. By 1910 this traffic was beginning to overwhelm the existing facilities at Nine Elms. Plans were therefore made for a hump marshaling yard and motive power depot at Feltham. The purchase of of land was confirmed in 1911, with additional land being purchased in 1915. This location gave excellent access to the company main lines as well as direct links to the Great Western Railway and London and North Western Railway, and to the Midland Railway, Great Northern Railway and Great Eastern Railway via the North London line. The plans were confirmed on 30 March 1916,The National Archives - RAIL 411/271 ‚Äì Traffic Committee 30/03/1916 ‚Äì 507 Feltham Marshalling Sidings. and work started soon after with the help of around 200 German prisoners of war. The first nine ‚Äòdown‚Äô sidings were opened on 9 December 1917 and the remainder by 2 October 1921. The yard was completed in 1921 and incorporated two gravity shunting humps and equipped with the latest automated technology including electrically operated points, and widespread use of Track circuits. In 1929 the new SR Z class shunter were trialled at Feltham before entering service across the Southern network. With of track, (the longest siding being in length and the shortest being ), it could handle 2,500 wagons a day. These were brought in by 50 down and 26 up trains, and being removed by 18 down and 46 up services. This was, probably, the busiest marshalling yard in the country at that time. Up to 3,390 wagons could be sorted per day and an incoming train of wagons could be sorted in 12 minutes. The yard fulfilled an important part in the rail network for over four decades, especially during World War II, passing in to Southern Railway ownership in 1923 and British Railways in 1948. However, with the reduction of freight traffic carried by rail in the 1960s the yard became redundant and closed on 6 January 1969. Part of the yard is occupied by the Royal Mail's Jubilee Mail Centre, which handles work for the TW, KT, GU postcode areas as well as parts of South and West London.

The shed was with six roads and could accommodate 42 locomotives. There were inspection pits throughout and a 50-ton engine-hoist. There was also an electrically driven turntable and an electrically operated coaling plant. In 1921 Robert Urie, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LSWR introduced four large 4-8-0 shunting tank locomotives of the G16 class specifically to operate the yard, and five similar H16 class of 4-6-2T to undertake the transfer freight workings from Feltham. In addition the depot had a large allocation of H15 and S15 4-6-0 locomotives for heavy freight duties. The G16 and H16 locomotives were all withdrawn between 1959 and 1962, and the depot was closed by British Railways in 1967.

He was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2013. He played college football at LSU. Wing achieved fame during several nationally televised games for his accuracy and leg strength in LSU's punting game. He was also the first college football player to be penalized under a new rule regarding on-field taunting during scoring plays. Early life Wing was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His parents are Kathi and David Wing, the latter of whom punted professionally for the Scottish Claymores for a time after unsuccessfully trying out with the Detroit Lions. Growing up, Wing played Australian rules football which he says has contributed to his ability to punt so accurately. The younger Wing was cut from his TAC Cup club, the Sandringham Dragons, ending his Australian rules career. At that time, family friends of the Wings in Baton Rouge, Louisiana offered to host him for his senior year of high school as part of a student exchange program while trying out American football punting. He attended Parkview Baptist High School, where he was named All-State, and received a scholarship offer from LSU. Notably, he did not recognize LSU head coach Les Miles when the latter made his first visit to recruit him; he had to be told who Miles was. His family moved to Baton Rouge during the 2011 season in order to be with him during his LSU career. College career In Summer 2011, Wing was arrested for simple battery of Cameron Chabert, and was issued a misdemeanor summons. As a redshirt freshman, Wing averaged 43.0 yards per punt in 42 punts with a long of 73 yards through 12 games. That same year, he landed 20 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line. Some have credited Wing with being the crucial element in top-ranked LSU's 9‚Äì6 overtime win at #2 Alabama in the 2011 season. From LSU's red zone Wing kicked a 73-yard punt, hitting a camera wire, forcing overtime. Wing gained notoriety during a game against the Florida Gators by stretching his arms out during a fake punt play on his way to a 52-yard touchdown. Due to a new rule taking effect that season, Wing was flagged for taunting, and the touchdown was nullified. Going into the BCS National Championship Game against Alabama, opponents had attempted to return Wing's punts only 17 times for a total of 6 yards. During 2011 and 2012, Wing averaged 44.6 yards per punt, which is the highest in school history for a player with at least 100 punts. However, Wing was suspended from the 2012 Chick-fil-A Bowl for an undisclosed violation of team rules. On 4 January 2013, Wing announced that he would enter the 2013 NFL Draft. Professional career =Philadelphia Eagles= After Wing went undrafted in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Philadelphia Eagles signed him to compete with Donnie Jones as the team's punter. On 25 August 2013, Wing was released by the Eagles. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 2014, Wing signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers to serve as the punter and holder for field goals and PATs. In the fourth quarter of a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his punt went only 29 yards, giving the ball to the Buccaneers at the Steelers' 46-yard line with 40 seconds to go. The Buccaneers scored the game-winning touchdown a few plays later. In a game against the Baltimore Ravens on 2 November 2014, following a botched snap on the extra point for which Wing was the holder, he completed a pass to Matt Spaeth for a two-point conversion, and thus became the first Australian player in NFL history to score from a pass. =New York Giants= On 4 September 2015, Wing was traded to the New York Giants for a seventh round draft pick. After the Giants acquired Wing from the Steelers, veteran punter Steve Weatherford was released the same day. In 2015, he punted 76 times and had a 44.5-yard gross average and a 38.9-yard net average. 33 of his punts were downed inside the 20-yard line, which tied the Giants‚Äô single-season record set by Brad Maynard in both 1997 and 1998. On 11 July 2016, Wing signed a 3-year contract extension with the Giants. The extension was reportedly worth three years and $6.45 million. Wing earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for two weeks in a row. In Week 14 against the Dallas Cowboys, Wing pinned the Cowboys inside the 20-yard line five times and in Week 15 for booting seven punts averaging 40 yards downing two inside the 20-yard line. On 10 March 2018, Wing was released by the Giants. =Memphis Express= In 2018, Wing signed with the Memphis Express of the AAF for the 2019 season. He was waived on 27 February 2019.

Neighbour countries Modern Argentina was once part of a Spanish viceroyalty, the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, whose administrative capital was Buenos Aires. The Argentine War of Independence broke the ties to Spain, but started as well a process of balkanization, as the administrative dependencies of the viceroyalty had weak links with each other and support to Spanish Monarchy was still strong in Upper Peru, Salta and scattered areas elsewhere. Once the wars of independence and the civil wars ended, the viceroyalty was replaced by four countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Revisionist historian Vicente Quesada began the territorial nationalism in Argentina, envisioning the territory of the Viceroyalty as a sort of \\"Great Argentina\\", the national limits the country should have had, which fell into Balkanization by a mixture of foreign interventions by Britain and Brazil, the apathy of the Unitarian Party, and poor Argentine diplomacy.Cavaleri, pp. 11-13. This view, disdainful of the neighbour countries, was crafted in the 1880s decade, influenced by the Argentine territorial expansion caused by the Conquest of the desert and by the Great European immigration wave to Argentina.Cavaleri, p. 14. According to Quesada, Juan Manuel de Rosas and Bartolom√© Mitre would have led policies attempting to revert the balkanization, at least partially.Cavalieri, p. 17. However, there is no documented interest of Rosas in the annexation of Bolivia, or just the Tarija province, maintaining the apathy of Bernardino Rivadavia over it.Cavalieri, p. 20. According to the mainstream Uruguayan historiography, the main goal of Rosas during the war with Uruguay was to destroy the economic power of Montevideo, a rival port of Buenos Aires since colonial times.Cavalieri, p. 21. Paraguay stayed neutral during the Argentine Civil Wars during Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia's rule, not allowing even the political asylum of the Unitarians; Rosas stayed in good terms with Paraguay for this. When Carlos Antonio L√≥pez proclaimed the independence of Paraguay in 1842, Rosas did not take a defined position towards it (he did not accept nor reject it) but sold weapons to L√≥pez and did not take any military action against Paraguay, in order to maintain him in a neutral position in the civil wars.Cavalieri, p. 22. Falkland Islands It considers the archipelago part of the Tierra del Fuego Province, along with South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The Argentine claim is included in the transitional provisions of the Constitution of Argentina as amended in 1994: In June 2009, the Argentine government said it intended to regain sovereignty over the Falkland Islands by peaceful means. Aerial photo of the disputed South Patagonian Ice Field Southern Patagonian Ice Field of the Chile‚ÄìArgentina border, between Mount Fitzroy and Cerro Murall√≥n, remain undefined, on the extrapolar ice field of Southern Patagonia. This desolate uninhabitable region is the last remaining border dispute between Chile and Argentina, outside of Antarctica. On 1 August 1991 the governments of Chile and Argentina had agreed on a borderline, but it was never ratified by the Argentine parliament due to its supposed favoring of Chile. The Argentine Parliament believed the border needed to be pushed farther west to encompass a larger part of the ice field as it provides a large deposit of fresh water, but the Chilean government felt it was already pushed too far west thinning their already thin strip of land in the region. The dispute would come up for demarcation again in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2009; however no official boundary has ever been reached.

The Bears concluded their pre-season against Abilene Christian University. The Bears began regular season play ranked #12 in both the AP and USA Today Coaches Pre-season polls. Coaching Scott Drew guided the Bears to school records in both conference wins (12) and wins overall (30). It was his ninth season as head coach. NCAA tournament In the 2011-12 season, Baylor had one of its best seasons since 2008-09, going 27-7, with their highest ranking being #3. They also won the Continental Tires Las Vegas Classic. These efforts lead to a #3 seed in the South region of the NCAA Tournament. In Baylor's second-round game of the tournament, there were a number of stand out performances. Bears sophomore Brady Heslip, hit nine 3-pointers on the way to a new career high of 27 points. Heslip help lead the Bears to a victory over the 11th seed University of Colorado, which earned them a spot in the final 16 to face Xavier University. In the sweet 16 game vs Xavier University, Baylor shot out of the gate with a commanding 20-4 lead, only to have that lead cut to 7 at half time. The non-existent paint game of the Baylor Bears in the second and third rounds was finally existent in the game against Xavier.

Point guard Pierre Jackson added 15 and Perry Jones III had 14 points. Burlington, Ontario's Brady Heslip helped clinch the victory by knocking down 4 crucial free throws in the last minute. On Sunday, March 25, 2012, the Baylor Bears played The University of Kentucky in an Elite 8 match up to see who would advance to The Final Four in New Orleans. The Bears were unable to match the size and athleticism of the Kentucky players. Kentucky dominated the first half and led by 20 points going into half time. Kentucky managed to absorb a 9-1 Baylor run midway through the second half and got back to playing their up-tempo game, leading them to the 82-70 victory over the Bears. Unfortunately for the Bears, their season came to an end in this Elite 8 match-up. \\"Kentucky are the most athletic team in the country; they forced us into turnovers and tough shots. They converted in transition and really showed their athleticism and sped the game up. They defended well too.\\" Quote from Brady Heslip. One of Baylor's four senior's, Quincy Acy, had an outstanding year as a Small Forward not only in the Final Four tournament but the regular season, and pre-season. He scored double-digits in the points column in a number of games, including setting a career high in blocks with 6 in a single game. Acy was named the Big 12 \\"Best Athlete\\" by Sporting News. Quincy will be graduating this year (2012) and is an eligible prospect for the upcoming NBA Draft. While Baylor will be losing a strong player and leader, they have a number of junior's and sophomore's with the talent and ability to step up into a leadership role for the 2012-13 season.

The conflict began when Poland's status expired as one of the Entente's most favoured nations in trade with Germany.Nonreciprocal most favoured nation status for all Allies of World War I (Entente) countries was determined in the Versailles treaty. Berlin then decided to raise customs duty, which primarily affected the Polish coal industry, Poland's main export to Germany. In return, Warsaw also raised duty on German goods. Germany's purpose in the war was to cause a breakdown of Poland's economy and gain political concessions. They included revanchist claims to Polish territories.Historia Polski, Tom 2, Henryk Samsonowicz, page 45 \\"Chciano rzuciƒá Polskƒô na kolana, wymusiƒá na niej ustƒôpstwa terytorialne\\" Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN 2007 Background In 1918, Poland gained independence after 123 years of foreign dominance. The economy of the newly created country was bad, the result of several wars fought on Polish soil between 1914 and 1921, and of many years of division between three partitioning powers. In 1919, industrial production on Polish lands fell by 70% in comparison to 1914, and the government in Warsaw had a difficult task. The country was divided into different economic and political systems, with several kinds of currency in circulation. The Baltic Sea port of the Free City of Danzig was not part of Poland. The lands of former Congress Poland, which before 1914 had been responsible for 15% of industrial production of the Russian Empire, were cut off from eastern markets after the creation of the Soviet Union. In addition, the collapse of Austria-Hungary destroyed the 19th century economic ties of Galicia with Austria and Bohemia. Poland's closest ally, France, was far away, and trade with Paris was limited. Germany emerged as a main trade partner and market for Polish products. In 1925, 40% of Polish foreign trade was with Germany, and Poland's western, most developed provinces, the Polish part of Upper Silesia, Greater Poland and Pomerelia, were even more dependent on Germany, their powerful western neighbor. Until 1925, Polish Upper Silesia sold half of its coal to Germany; in Poland, there was little demand for the rest because industrial production in Polish territory was a fraction of what it had been; in 1921, it was a mere 35% of its 1913 level. Polish-German relations After World War I, the German Empire lost its eastern Province of Posen and West Prussia to Poland, partially after uprisings by the Polish population in Greater Poland and Silesia. These areas (Greater Poland and Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania) had been taken by Prussia in the Polish Partitions. Further territorial claims of Poland were settled in the East Prussian plebiscite and the Upper Silesia plebiscite. While Germany controlled the territories, more than 154,000 German colonists settled in the region, in addition to at least 378.000 German military and officials which were stationed in Polish territories.Germany and Poland: from war to peaceful relations, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wszeb√≥r Kulski, page 24, Syracuse University Press, 1976 Polish Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. In the early interwar period, in Germany, the Second Polish Republic was regarded a \\"temporary state\\" (\\"Saisonstaat\\") and tensions between the two nations were high. The German-Polish border was never officially accepted by Germany and from the start of 1919 German foreign policy aimed at revising the Versailles Treaty and acquiring once more Polish territories.Encyklopedia historii Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej Andrzej Garlicki, page 328, Wiedza Powszechna 1999 To pursue its goals of territorial revisionism, Germany emphasized the presence of a German minority in Poland.Stosunki polsko-niemieckie 1919‚Äì1932:XVII Konferencja Wsp√≥lnej Komisji PodreÃ¶cznikowej PRL-RFN Historyk√≥w, 11 -17.

On 30 August 1924 in Vienna Convention, both governments agreed on the eviction of 28,000‚Äì30,000 Germans living in Poland who had chosen German citizenship (\\"Optanten\\" in German) and of 5,000 Poles living in Germany who had chosen Polish citizenship (\\"Optanci\\" in Polish).Stosunki polsko-niemieckie 1919‚Äì1932:XVII Konferencja Wsp√≥lnej Komisji PodreÃ¶cznikowej PRL-RFN Historyk√≥w, 11 -17. VI. 1984 r.,Augsburg, Antoni Czubi≈Ñski, Zbigniew Kulak, Gemeinsame Deutsch-Polnische Schulbuchkommission, Komisja Podrƒôcznikowa Historyk√≥w PRL i RFN, page 44 Instytut Zachodni, 1990 The Weimar Republic, which in 1926 became a member of the League of Nations, enjoyed a period of relative prosperity, which had a positive effect on Poland. The population in the territories of Silesia and parts of Poland of the former Prussian partition, a significant minority of them ethnic Germans, became Polish citizens. Ethnic Germans were entitled to \\"opt\\" for German citizenship and leave the country; this group was called \\"Optanten\\". The Polish government sought to keep the granting of citizenship in tight limits; people who left the area in the post-war turmoils (the majority of whom were former German military personnel and officials stationed on Polish territory) were regarded \\"tacit Optants\\". According to the Minorities Treaty (also called the \\"Little Versailles Treaty\\") signed by Poland, all former citizens of partitioning powers who rejected Polish citizenship had to leave the country by 10 January 1923. This concerned citizens of Russia, Hungary, Austria and Germany, though in the case of Germans opting for German citizenship, there was no precise date established for them to leave. Per the treaty of Versailles, the victorious countries, including Poland, were authorized to liquidate the property of German nationals. Helmut Lippelt writes that Germany used the existence of the German minority in Poland for political purposes and as part of its revanchist demands, prompting Polish countermeasures. Polish Prime- Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski stated in 1923 that the de-Germanization of these territories had to be ended by vigorous and quick liquidation of property and eviction of German \\"Optanten\\"; German nationalists were to be convinced that their view of the temporary state of Poland's western border was wrong. To Lippelt this was partially a reaction to the German claims and partially nationalism, urging to exclude the German element. In turn, German policy was fueled by anti-Polish prejudice. German Foreign minister Gustav Stresemann In 1925, Gustav Stresemann proposed an agreement with France (the Locarno Treaties) and made it clear that in doing so, he intended to \\"gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and [...] concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East\\". Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have \\"prematurely\\" stabilized the Polish economy. In response to a British proposal, Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London, \\"[A] final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong\\". According to Stresemann's letter, there was to be no settlement \\"until [Poland's] economic and financial distress ha[d] reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness\\". However, Stresemann did not intend to provoke a trade war. The German press openly praised the trade war, hoping it would lead to destruction of the Polish state. As the Frankfurter Zeitung wrote on 14 June 1924, \\"Poland must be mortally wounded after the trade war. With her blood her strength will flow away as well, and finally her independence\\" Customs war between Poland and Germany In the immediate post-World War I period, trade between both nations was regulated by the Treaty of Versailles and by the Geneva Convention on Upper Silesia (1922). The Treaty of Versailles required Germany to give most favoured nation status unilaterally to all Triple Entente countries as well as to its newly created eastern neighbors. The export of goods produced in the former territories of the German Empire now in the Second Polish Republic was generally tax-free, to avoid economic collapse of the territories\\"Wielkie mocarstwa wobec Polski 1919‚Äì1945: od Wersalu do Ja≈Çty\\" Jan Karski p. 80, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sk≈Çodowskiej 1998 According to the Geneva Convention, Germany was obliged to allow export of specified quantities of coal from the Polish part of Upper Silesia. Both documents were valid until 15 June 1925. In June 1924, a new customs law was passed in Poland. Its aim was to protect the Polish market from foreign competitors and cover increased financial needs. It was supposed to serve as a basis for future trade agreements. While divergent terms were settled in bilateral treaties between Poland and France, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Greece, the taxes on other imports were raised 100%. Poland asked for renewal of the trade privileges but refused to grant most favoured nation status to German goods. In the negotiations of early 1925, Germany tried to buy time by raising trade and minority issues, such as the \\"Optanten\\" problem, liquidation measures and settlement rights; on 15 June, the relevant clauses of the treaty would expire. Germany demanded Poland to give up undisputed rights from the Treaty of Versailles and to revise the Vienna Convention, closed six months earlier. The Germans hoped that Poland would make concessions, and once again, German businessmen would follow German trade across the border. That was a sensitive issue for Poland, having just thrown off German political and economic influence. Also, Germany demanded privileges for the German minority. Polish Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski In January 1925, when Germany recovered its trade policy sovereignty, all purchases of Polish coal were stopped and customs duties raised on all Polish-made products. Some Polish exports were subject to a German embargo. Warsaw responded by raising tariffs on German goods. Negotiations began in Berlin on 3 March 1925. Germany demanded more privileges for the German minority in Poland as a pre-condition for resumption of the coal trade, but Warsaw refused. The zloty lost value, with a reduction of the Polish industrial output. The most-affected area was Polish Upper Silesia, the most developed part of the nation but also the one most dependent on trade with Germany. In November 1925, the government of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski collapsed. Germany also blocked Polish attempts to get a British loan from, as Germany planned to annex Polish territory after the fall of the Polish state. When Polish delegations tried to reach a peaceful understanding with Germany on 10 December 1926, Stresemann rejected the talks by saying there would be no normalization of German-Polish relations until the \\"border problems\\" were resolved. To clarify, he identified Upper Silesia, Pomerania and Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) as \\"border problems\\". Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht agreed and stated that any economic agreements with Poland must be preceded by Poland's relinquishment of Upper Silesia and the Polish Corridor to Germany. Robert Spaulding wrote that over time \\"German political demands grew fantastic\\". Officially, the customs war lasted until March 1934 and was settled after the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact. Poland was aided to some extent by Czechoslovakia, Austria and Italy, whose governments reduced rail tariffs on Polish exports and transit, increasing export of Polish coal to there. Also, Scandinavian markets also opened to Poland because of 1926 United Kingdom general strike. Aftermath German ambassador Hans-Adolf von Moltke, Polish leader J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and J√≥zef Beck, Polish Foreign minister, meeting in Warsaw on 15 June 1934, three months after the end of the Polish-German customs-war The Polish government, facing a breakdown in international trade, was forced to initiate a program of internal investment, which resulted in the growth of local production. Unemployment was reduced by a mass public works program, with two important components, the construction of the new Baltic Sea port of Gdynia, and the Polish Coal Trunk-Line, a rail connection between Upper Silesia and Gdynia. Since the zloty had lost much of its value, export of Polish coal to Scandinavia became profitable. Paradoxically, the war had some positive consequences. Poland found new trade partners, and a program of modernization of the country was accelerated. Also, the port of Gdynia enjoyed dynamic growth. At the same time, growing poverty and unemployment resulted in strikes and demonstrations; the political mood was radicalized. One of the consequences of the war was The May Coup d'√âtat of 1926, carried out by Jozef Pilsudski. For Germany, the customs war had a negligible effect, as exports to Poland were only 4 to 5% of German international trade.

Musculoskeletal problems also called mechanical because many of them linked to vertebrae physical motions. Description Back pain itself is not considered a diagnosis, but rather a symptom of underlying (in most cases musculoskeletal) problems. following: * Vertebrae misalignment, which can cause nerve interference (also called subluxation), muscle tension, or muscle spasm * Strained muscles * Sprained ligaments * Ruptured disks, which also called \\"slipped\\", or herniated disks * Degenerative discs (lose their cushioning ability). The degeneration usually caused by repetitive strain, or injury, or aging. * Irritated joints  Back pain recurrence risk reduction  * Use safe lifting technique, don't bend over, and maintain your back straight when lifting heavy objects * Push instead of pulling when moving heavy objects * Stay active: regular exercises and physical activities help to maintain back muscles and ligaments strong. In turn, strong back muscles provide better support for spine to keep the vertebrae properly aligned, which can ease the back pain and reduce the risk of chronic back pain returning. Although, for acute back pain exercises usually not recommended and physical activity should be slow, but it is critical to keep moving as much as possible, because inactivity leads to weakening back muscles and ligaments, and to gain more weight, which might exacerbate back pain. * Sit Up Straight! The way you sit may either cause or help to prevent back pain. * Maintain proper posture: In many cases poor posture (also called bad posture) is the root cause of back pain because of more stress on the disks and less back muscles activity. Most common bad posture samples are round back, sway back, forward head, excessive anterior and exterior pelvis tilts. Proper standing, sitting, and lifting techniques help to reduce the risk of back pain returning. Good posture trains and strengthens back muscles naturally. Maintaining good posture when walking, standing, and sitting in addition to standard medical treatments (and alternative therapies such as chiropractic manipulations) is likely to address the roots of many back pain problems.

He has been represented and shown by galleries in New York, Paris, Berlin, Italy, Mexico City.Gomez, Edward M. \\"Discovering Art With the Aura of the Outsider,\\" The New York Times, February 20, 2000 A master draftsman, Zindato has developed a labor-intensive, meticulously detailed drawing technique, using nib pens and fine-haired brushes on paper, to create semi-abstract images packed with mysterious motifs and elaborate patterns. Set against brightly colored backgrounds, Zindato‚Äôs drawings read, from a distance, as abstract. Viewed closely, however, they reveal the artist‚Äôs intricate pattern-making, with its dynamic swirls, eddies, and enigmatic symbols: eyeballs, floating heads, wave-like ripples and hand-drawn letters, resulting in an interlocking visual experience of micro and macro dimensions. His method has earned him the admiration of connoisseurs of self-taught art. His art reflects the colors of his travels in India, Mexico, Haiti, Morocco, between others, and suggests affinities with pre-historic cave paintings, indigenous cultures, shamanism, African textiles, Australian Aboriginal art, Middle-Ages illuminated manuscripts, 20th century spiritualism, Psychelic iconography, Buddhist Mandalas, Native-American decorative patterns.Gomez, Edward M. \\"Domenico Zindato at Phyllis Kind,\\" Art in America April 2008  References   Further reading  Charles Russell, Groundwaters: A Century of Self-taught and Outsider Artists, Prestel Edward M.

The common name for this plant is Hill's thistle.  Description  Hill's thistle is a low-growing thistle usually reaching in height, with a taproot system that runs deep into the ground. It is a perennial plant usually living for three years, and flowers in July and August. The plant's leaves are an elliptic-oblong shape with serrated edges, have tiny prickles, and have one central vein with smaller veins branching from it. The top of the stem holds a composite flower head, each consisting of many individual disc florets but no ray florets. The flowers of this plant are usually purple though sometimes pink or white. Hill's thistle tends to looks very similar to Cirsium vulgare during its seedling and rosette stages; one can easily be mistaken for the other.Flora of North America, Hill‚Äôs thistle, Cirsium pumilum (Nuttall) Sprengel var. hillii (Canby) B. Boivin  Habitat  Hill's thistle thrives in areas that are open, sandy, and dry. It also grows well in areas that are susceptible to fire and areas lacking tall vegetation. Its preferred habitats include sand prairies, sand dunes, open wooded areas, and limestone plains with thin soil and little vegetation. Natural fires are important for Hill's thistle because they burn large trees and debris, which reduces competition and allows it to grow.  Range  Hill's thistle is an endemic species to North America, found only in Canada and the United States. It is found around the Great Lakes, in the southern part of Ontario, as well as Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map, Cirsium hillii  Importance to humans and the ecosystem  Hill's thistle is not used for medicine, food, or fibres. This lack of utility may be beneficial to its persistence in the wild, as it has been suggested that samples only be collected for scientific reasons. It does, however, play an important role in its ecosystem because it is consumed by whitetail deer. Multiple plants grow near Hill's thistle, such as big and little bluestem, blazing star, rough fescue, pale agoseris, juniper, hair grass, western sunflower, and field chickenweed. Because Hill's thistle is one of the first plants to colonize its habitat, perhaps it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and benefits these other plants.  Conservation  The Committee of the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada last examined Hill's thistle in 2004 and named it as \\"threatened\\" due to its \\"rarity, restricted range, and human factors, which make it susceptible to extinction,\\". The plant's main threats include aggregate demand, shoreline development, and invasive species. Human recreation and development encroachment may also negatively impact Hill's thistle. Hill's thistle generally only lives to be 2 or 3 years old, typically flowering at 3 years. This could pose a problem in terms of conservation because, if fewer plants survive to the flowering stage at the end of their life, there will be less production of offspring. Lack of disturbance by natural fires is another reason why Hill's thistle is threatened. This plant needs an open, dry, grassy environment in order to thrive. Areas where it previously succeeded are now managed to prevent fires, allowing the invasion of shrubs and trees, which outcompete the open-habitat species. Hill's thistle is a rare species found in relatively few places around the globe and thus ongoing conservation efforts are essential for its survival. Suggestions for the conservation of this species include reducing shoreline development and aggregate demand in its habitat. Conservation efforts should also focus determining how management of fires affects seedling establishment and what can be done in regards to fire reduction.

On July 1, 1996, it was completely restructured as the Federal Commission on Securities Market, which is what it is known as today. From that point on, various resolutions were made to further assert its strength and the safety of financiers. In the early 1990s, Anatoly Chubais was put in charge of privatization in Russia. The purpose of these efforts was to attempt to remove power from the Communist Party. Dmitry Vassiliev was chosen by Chubais to spearhead the management of the privatization efforts. During the process, Chubais agreed to give up to 40% of the privatized initiatives to the manager of the initiative in order to attract people to the privatization efforts. Chubais also had a back-up plan which allowed those managers and workers to purchase 51% of their initiative at a reduced cost. The only issue was that privatization required the purchase of ownership shares and not many people had the funds to be able to make those purchases due to inflation. To combat this issue, Chubais created vouchers but there was another issue that arose. Although there was much support from the public for privatization, there were no state initiatives that wanted to be privatized. Soon after the privatization of the Bolshevik Biscuit Factory, Yegor Gaidar was replaced as prime minister by Viktor Chernomyrdin who considered the prior attempts at privatization to be criminal acts. Despite Chernomyrdin's claims, privatization continued to progress and about 2/3 of the initiatives were privatized by 1994. Although privatization did remove power from the Communist Party, millions of Russians were impoverished while a small number of Russians became very wealth. Today, the beneficiaries of the Russian privatization efforts are commonly referred to as oligarchs.Freeman, C. (2000). Sale of the century. New York: Crown Publisher.

There are more than 20 nominal species, varying in size between 8 and 200 micrometers. Peranema cells are gliding flagellates found in freshwater lakes, ponds and ditches, and are often abundant at the bottom of stagnant pools rich in decaying organic material. Although they belong to the class Euglenoidea, and are morphologically similar to the green Euglena, Peranema have no chloroplasts, and do not conduct autotrophy. Instead, they capture live prey, such as yeast, bacteria and other flagellates, consuming them with the help of a rigid feeding apparatus called a \\"rod-organ.\\" Unlike the green euglenids, they lack both an eyespot (stigma), and the paraflagellar body (photoreceptor) that is normally coupled with that organelle. However, while Peranema lack a localized photoreceptor, they do possess the light- sensitive protein rhodopsin, and respond to changes in light with a characteristic \\"curling behaviour.\\" O.F. M√ºller's Vibrio strictus The earliest record of a Peranema is in O.F. M√ºller's Animalcula Infusoria of 1786, which describes an \\"elongated linear\\" creature, \\"stretched out at the front.\\" M√ºller named it Vibrio strictus, placing it among the \\"long-necked\\" infusoria, along with Lacrymaria olor and Dileptus. The species Peranema trichophorum was seen and described in 1838 by C.G. Ehrenberg, who, like M√ºller before him, took the flagellum for a necklike extension of the body, and placed it in the ciliate genus Trachelius. Peranema was correctly identified as a flagellate by F√©lix Dujardin, who created the genus in 1842, giving it the name Pyronema, for its pyriform (pear-shaped) body. However, because that name had already been applied to a genus of fungi, he amended the genus to Peranema, formed from the Greek œÄŒ≠œÅŒ± (a leather purse or sack) and ŒΩŒÆŒºŒ± (a thread). Unfortunately, this name had also been claimed earlier, for a genus of ferns first collected in Nepal. As a result, botanists, following the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, customarily refer to the protist Peranema as Pseudoperanema; whereas protozoologists, following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, have continued to call the genus by the name Dujardin gave it. Appearance and characteristics Peranema Peranema's basic anatomy is that of a typical Euglenid. The cell is spindle or cigar-shaped, somewhat pointed at the anterior end. It has a pellicle with parallel finely-ridged proteinaceous strips underlain by microtubules arranged in a helical fashion around the body. With this type of pellicle, which is shared by many Euglenids, the spiraling microtubular strips are able to slide past one another, giving the organism an extremely plastic and changeable body shape. This permits a type of squirming motility, sometimes referred to as \\"Euglenoid movement\\" or \\"metaboly\\". When it is not gliding or swimming (poorly), Peranema can move by metaboly, progressing with wavelike contractions of the body, reminiscent of peristalsis. At the anterior of the cell, there is a narrow aperture, opening into a flask-shaped \\"reservoir\\", from which the organism's two flagella emerge. At the bottom of this reservoir lie the basal bodies (centrioles) from which the flagella extend. One flagellum is relatively long and conspicuous, and when the Peranema is gliding it is held stiffly in front. At the tip of the flagellum, a short segment beats and flails in a rhythmic manner, possibly as a mechanism for detecting and contacting potential prey. Peranama usually glides belly-down, without rotating. The second flagellum is difficult to see with bright field microscopy, and was entirely overlooked by early observers. It emerges from the same reservoir as the larger propulsive flagellum, but turns toward the posterior. It does not sit freely, like the trailing flagella of Dinema and Entosiphon, but adheres to the outside of the cell membrane, in a groove along its ventral surface. Next to the reservoir, lies Peranema's highly developed feeding apparatus, a cytostomal sac supported on one side by a pair of rigid rods, fused together at the anterior end. The use of this \\"rod-organ\\" in feeding has attracted considerable scholarly interest. Some early researchers speculated that it might assist Peranema in tearing up and consuming its food; while others held that it was actually a tubular construction, serving as a cytopharynx. In 1950, Y. T. Chen accurately identified it as a structure separate from the reservoir, which could be used by Peranama to cut and pierce its prey. Brenda Nisbet questioned this, on the grounds that, when examined closely with an electron microscope, the rod-organ is blunt, and therefore an improbable instrument for either cutting or piercing. Since the rod-organ had been seen to move back and forth during feeding, Nisbet argued that its primary function is to create suction, drawing prey into the cytostome. In 1997, Richard Triemer returned to the subject, to confirm Chen's opinion that Peranema has a dual feeding technique. It can swallow prey whole, pulling large flagellates through the cytostome, in a manner similar to that proposed by Brenda Nisbet. However, it can also choose a more elaborate style of attack. Sometimes, it will press its cytostome against its prey, and then move the rod-organ up and down, using a rasping motion to chew a hole in its victim's cell membrane. After consuming some of the protoplasm, the Peranema may then insert its large flagellum into the hole, using it to churn up the contents of the cell so that they may be more easily sucked out. This continues until nothing is left of the prey but the tattered remnants of its pellicle. Phylogeny and classification Peranema, as drawn by William Saville-Kent in 1880 When Dujardin created the genus Peranema in 1841, he was unable to detect the second flagellum and classified it with other ostensibly uniflagellate \\"Eugl√©niens,\\" Astasia and Euglena. In 1881 Georg Klebs drew a taxonomical distinction between colorless uniflagellates that live by phagotrophy (Peranema and Astasia) and the green uniflagellates that photosynthesize (Euglena). This distinction was generally abandoned after the publication, in 1952, of a major revision of the Euglenoids. In 1997, a combined morphological and molecular analysis of certain Euglenoids identified Peranama trichophorum, Euglena gracilis and Khawkinea quartana as a distinct monophyletic lineage, with P. trichophorum basal to the other two species.

She was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and has also lived in Texas, Louisiana, Washington and Montana. She emigrated to Canada with her husband Rob Porter, from the fourth generation of a Saskatchewan farm family, and resides in North Saanich, British Columbia. She has received praise for her young adult novels, especially The Crazy Man. Her poetry won the Prism International Poetry Prize, the Vallum Magazine Poetry Prize, and has appeared in literary magazines in Canada and the U.S.  Biography  = Early life = Porter lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico until halfway through kindergarten. Her father, who worked for an insurance company, was transferred, and then the family moved to Dallas, Texas. When Porter was 12 years old, her father was transferred to Monroe, Louisiana, where she attended Robert E. Lee Junior High. She remembers her school as being very strict; she had to address all her elders as \\"Yes, Ma'am, No, Ma'am, Yes, Sir, No, Sir.\\" She was first introduced to racism at her school when everyone treated the African American staff with no respect by calling them by their first names and playing around with them. She recalls becoming very interested in world politics and the civil rights movement by watching the evening news every day. Porter was first introduced to poetry while flipping through the back of her English language arts book in class. She picked up books from the library, books of poetry and pieces that usually were short, the length she felt she could read. She was also introduced to poems by Robert Frost, particularly \\"Desert Places\\". She believed she was always destined to be an author, and remembers always wanting to play the game \\"Authors\\" instead of \\"Scrabble\\" as a child. = Later life = Porter finished her undergraduate degree at Southern Methodist University. She now holds an MFA in poetry writing from the University of Montana. When she first entered university, she was very interested in languages. She studied the German language for a few years and was interested in becoming fluent in some other languages and becoming a translator. Porter also is an accomplished musician, noted particularly for her abilities in piano, guitar, and singing, and was encouraged by university faculty to major in music. Porter was 19 years old when she took her first writing course with John Skoyles. Other teachers were Jack Myers, Richard Hugo, and later Lorna Crozier, and Patrick Lane. Soon after earning her MFA she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Bread Loaf Writer's Conference in Vermont. Porter met her husband in a bell choir. She and Rob traveled a lot together before having children; they lived in New Mexico at the National Solar Observatory near Cloudcroft, and then moved to Seattle before moving to Ulm, Montana to be closer to Rob's family, who were in Calgary. The family now resides near Sidney, British Columbia. Porter has been a professor at the University of Victoria as a sessional instructor. For generations, her family has gone to Saskatchewan every summer to work on the farm.  Analysis  = Influences = Pamela Porter has said that her first influence was the Bible. She was raised in a family of stalwart Presbyterians who was strict followers of their religion. She learned to read at the age of five as her father held his finger beneath the words in a hymn book. She has early memories of hearing the King James Bible read aloud; this gave her an introduction to literature and diverse vocabulary at a young age. Porter's second influence was Robert Frost. She has said that The Complete Poems of Robert Frost was the only book of literature in her house; her mother received it as a gift. No one had opened it until Porter pulled the book down from a high shelf and began to read it. Other influences on Porter include Li-Young Lee, Carolyn Forche Lorna Crozier, and Patrick Lane. She leans towards \\"poets who make effortless music with language while still holding their humanity close.\\" = Cultural impact = Porter's work has had a great impact on juvenile audiences. Young readers voted The Crazy Man across Canada as their favorite book of the year. Her books are distinguishable from other children books as their themes deal with real life issues and are often based on serious subjects, and are written in verse rather than conventional prose. They involve difficult and challenging experiences that children have encountered or will encounter in their lives, and are stories that many children can relate to. A prime example is The Crazy Man, which deals with the abandonment of one parent or another or sometimes both, thus telling the story of how people heal from tragedy and what they do to arrive at the point of healing, and even of gratitude. However, as Porter is first and foremost a poet, her adult poetry is gaining a wider and more expansive readership. She has also been deeply involved with rescuing animals, including dogs, cats, horses, and a rabbit, and taking them in as her own. Porter claims her love for animals was always in her, but she began to adopt animals while living on a ranch in Montana and Saskatchewan.

Among his few compositions always mentioned by his contemporaries are his both symphonies, violin concertos, piano pieces and an oratorio, although none of them is known to be preserved. Biography =Life= Peter Lem was born in Copenhagen and received his first education from his father, John L., accountant for Skillings-Ligkassenthen, and his mother Kirstine, n√©e Tonnesen. Still as a child he drew the attention of concert master Johann Hartmann, of whom he became a pupil. As a twelve-year- old child he could perform \\"even the most difficult concertos and solos, not without admiration from those who listened to him\\", which was read in the Adresseavisen after the boy had had his debut as soloist and member of Det musikalske Selskab at a concert in R√•dhusstr√¶de (City Hall Street) on 1 February 1770. The following year he was admitted to the Royal Chapel and traveled with royal subsidy abroad to seek further education, staying especially in Vienna and Italy, and returned to Copenhagen in 1783. On 11 February 1784 he gave a concert at the Royal Danish Theatre, where he received tumultuous applause for his extraordinary skill, his tasteful performance, particularly in the adagio, and his uncommonly elegant bowing. In 1785 he began teaching violin playing in the Chapel, succeeding Hartmann in 1793 as concert master, an honor which at the time was very rare. Shortly after that he was appointed professor. =Legacy= Lem's importance for the development of live concerts in Copenhagen was very significant and groundbreaking in several directions, not only as a virtuoso and soloist, but also as a chamber music player and leader of Det harmoniske Selskab. He made large profits as a concertist and also as a teacher to his young students. From his public activities he drew back relatively early, by reason of infirmity spending his last years in seclusion. He died in Copenhagen on 12 January 1828, leaving his spouse Regina, Countess Magliani, widow. She survived him by 4 years (d. 23 May 1832). His compositions are only a few, among them a violin concerto and two symphonies written for his 1784 concert, and an oratorio: Christ Church, written for his 1785 Violin Concerto. Published in Vienna and in his native land is only his 12 Minuets for small orchestra written in 1784. He played for the last time in 1811.

Representative Eddy Gonzalez and Representative Jose F. Diaz currently serve as the Chair and Vice Chair of the Delegation, respectively. All Chair and Vice Chair serve one year terms. The current Director of the Miami-Dade County Delegation is Alex Dominguez. He has been with the Delegation since February 2009. Function The Delegation's office primary function is to assist the Legislative Delegation in its daily activities. Those activities range from representing the Delegation members at various community meetings, writing press releases for all legislative achievements/awards of the members, assists citizens in communicating with the members, organizing public hearings and acting as a liaison between the Intergovernmental Affairs Office and the Delegation as needed. Public hearings Each year, the Delegation office organizes public hearings which affords the general public, governmental entities and community groups the opportunity to express/request assistance with various projects/issues. The hearings are held in various locations around the County with one normally scheduled for the Commission Chambers. The Delegation formulates its list of legislative priorities from the information obtained at those public hearings. From that list and what the County submits, the Delegation will vote during the first week of the Legislative Session on their list of Critical/Priority Issues.

They are present in low and mountain cloud forest in Southeast Asia. The genus was described originally from Vietnam by Andr√© Joseph Guillaume Henri Kostermans, and published in 1973. The type species is Cinnadenia paniculata. Description They are trees up to 40 m high, mostly 30 m high, and are hermaphrodites. Some species are slow-growing canopy trees. The leaves are alternate, entire, and elliptical or narrowly elliptical; they are 10 to 25 cm long and 3‚Äì8 cm wide. Many species have valuable timber; others have the wood and bark pleasantly scented, like most of the genera of the Lauraceae, such as Cinnamomum. The oils extracted are used as ingredients in the manufacture of perfumes. Ecology They grow in evergreen tropical forests. Species in less humid environment are smaller or less robust, with less abundant and thinner foliage and have oleifera cells that give trees a more fragrant aroma. It is present in the Himalayas mountain cloud forest in Bhutan, Assam, Myanmar, and Vietnam. They grow also in evergreen lowlands tropical laurel forests. They do not form large stands, but rather small groups of trees with a density of up to one individual per five hectares. The ecological requirements of the genus are those of fog moisture precipitating almost continuously in a natural habitat, cloud-covered for much of the year. These species are found in tropical forests, subtropical temperate evergreen, or montane evergreen forests, which are a type of rainforest or cloud forest. The ecosystem is characterized by high humidity, no seasonal changes, and a wide variety of botanical and zoological species, but also highly fragile against external aggressions. The temperate evergreen and evergreen forests are typically multispecies with evergreen and hardwood trees, reaching up to 40 m in height. The forests are made up of laurel-leaved evergreen hardwood trees, harbouring a rich biota of understorey plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It is present in tropical and subtropical montane rainforest, laurel forest, in the weed-tree forests in valleys, mixed forests of coniferous and deciduous broad- leaved trees, Tsuga forests; from northern Vietnam to the Himalayas. Cinnadenia species require continuously moist soil, and do not tolerate drought. The laurel trees falls within the broad-leaved forests; mid-montane deciduous forests; and high-montane mixed stunted forests. Some species growing to high altitude forests at . Three taxa are commonly found at tree line: an evergreen, needle-leaved gymnosperm (Abies pindrow Spach.), an evergreen, broad-leaved sclerophyllous oak (Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.), and a deciduous, broad-leaved birch (Betula utilis Don). Vernal flowering is common at this elevation in Central Himalaya. In general, in their elevational distribution and structural-functional attributes, these high-altitude forests are similar to other forests of cool temperate zones in Himalaya. The most known trees are used by the timber industry. Cinnadenia malayana is on the Red List of Threatened Species.

History  There has historically been some difficulty in identifying people as Koli or as Bhil people in what is now the state of Gujarat. The two communities co-existed in the hills of that area and even today there is confusion regarding their identity, not helped, in the opinion of sociologist Arvind Shah, by there being \\"hardly any modern, systematic, anthropological, sociological or historical study\\" of the Kolis. Sources from the medieval period suggest that the term koli was applied generically to lawless people, whilst British colonial studies considered it to be a vague collective noun for varied communities whose sole common feature was that they were inferior to the Kunbis. At some stage, koli became accepted as a caste and thus superior to the tribal Bhils. = Early = Records of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and dacoits. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not Rajputs, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of hypergamous marriage, which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status. There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups. Through the colonial British Raj period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants, although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers. By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the Patidar community due to the land reforms of the Raj period. = Twentieth century = During the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed sanskritisation. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the ritual title of Kshatriya. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers ‚Äî around 4 - 5 per cent of the population ‚Äî were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a criminal tribe by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience. In 1947, around the time that India gained independence, the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an umbrella organisation to continue the work begun during the Raj. Christophe Jaffrelot, a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \\"... is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests. ... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\\" The relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as Backward Classes in the Indian scheme for positive discrimination. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the Indian National Congress and then, by the early 1960s, with the Swatantra Party. By 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged. Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal Bhils, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \\"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\\". The Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the Brahmins and Patidars. Their many JƒÅtis include the Bareeya, Khant and Thakor, and they also use Koli as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.  Classification  , various communities bearing the Koli name appear in the central lists of Other Backward Classes maintained by the National Commission for Backward Classes, although at least one is also in part recognised as a Scheduled Tribe. These classifications have been in force since at least 1993. The Government of India classified the Koli community as Scheduled Caste in the 2001 census for the states of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.  Koli Christian  While the Koli are mostly Hindu, in Mumbai, Converted Native Christians include autochthonous Koli East Indian Catholics, who were converted by the Portuguese during the 16th century.

The major combatants - Germany and Japan on the one side and Britain, the United States and the USSR on the other - manufactured huge air forces which engaged in pitched battles both with each other and with the opposing ground forces. Bombing established itself as a major strategic force, and this was also the first war in which the aircraft carrier played a significant role. As with Aviation in World War I, military investment during World War II drove aviation forward in leaps and bounds. The streamlined cantilever monoplane quickly proved its worth in almost every role, although a few older biplanes remained in niche roles for much of the war. Engine power and aircraft performance increased steadily, with jet and rocket engines beginning to make their appearance by the end of the war. Avionics systems increased in sophistication and became more widespread, including power-assisted flight controls, blind flying instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking. The development of civil aviation stagnated until peace could be restored, and in the combatant countries many existing civilian aircraft were pressed into military service. However military technologies developed during the war would revolutionise postwar aviation. In particular, the widespread construction of aerodromes with serviceable runways would provide the basis for a postwar move of long-range passenger flights from flying boats to landplanes. Aircraft =Airframes= The streamlined cantilever monoplane quickly proved its worth in almost every role, although a few older biplanes and other obsolescent types remained in niche roles for much of the war. Key design features during this period included: *Stressed-skin semi-monocoque construction, typically of aluminium light alloy but sometimes of wooden or mixed construction. *A clean, unbraced cantilever monoplane wing. *Conventional tail or empennage, with bombers often adopting twin tail fins, believed to improve stability during the bombing run. *retracting landing gear of conventional configuration with a tailwheel or tailskid. *Landing flaps. *Variable-pitch propellers in tractor configuration. *Fully enclosed cockpit. The retracting undercarriage gave landplanes a significant performance advantage over the equivalent seaplane, whose floats caused additional drag. In other respects, the evolution of seaplane design paralleled landplane developments. Seaplanes, typically flying boats, remained in use for long- range maritime operations. Smaller craft, typically floatplanes, remained in other niche areas such as mountain lakes where a runway was not feasible.Munson, K.; \\"Flying boats and seaplanes,\\" Blandford (1971) Experiments on other configurations continued throughout the war, especially in Germany. A small number of twin tailboom types entered production, and some slower types designed for roles such as Army observation retained the older fixed undercarriage. Towards the end of the war the first jet aircraft entered service; the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance bomber, Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe (Swallow) fighter and Gloster Meteor fighter. The Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet (Comet) interceptor was both rocket powered and of tailless configuration. Both of the Messerschmitt types had swept wings to delay the onset of small shock waves and the accompanying drag at transonic speeds. Other German types delivered to front-line units in the last days of the war included the rocket- powered vertical-takeoff Bachem Ba 349 Natter (Adder) interceptor ‚Äî the very first manned, rocket-powered aircraft to launch vertically as designed ‚Äî and the jet-powered Heinkel He 162 Spatz (sparrow) light fighter.Green (1970) Other variations were flown but never entered production, sometimes independently by different countries. These included the canard or tail-first configuration in combination with a pusher propeller, the flying wing, the slip-wing which took off as a biplane and then discarded the upper wing, and twin centrally-mounted engines in push-pull configuration with a tractor installation at the front and a pusher installation in the rear.Green (1970) Gliders Military gliders such as the British Airspeed Horsa and specialised tugs such as the German Heinkel He 111Z were developed by a number of countries during World War II, for landing assault troops and equipment behind enemy lines. These gliders were characterised by a steep gliding angle and short landing run, allowing a short time in the air and precision landing. However they were highly vulnerable and their dependence on surprise severely limited their success. The British used them extensively in the battle of Arnhem and suffered huge losses. Rotorcraft Rotorcraft had been produced before the war in the form of the autogyro and many, such as the Avro Rota, a license-built Cierva design, continued in use throughout the war. The Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 Bachstelze (Wagtail) unpowered rotor kite was towed behind submarines for use as an observation platform. In 1942 the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) observation platform became the first true helicopter with a power-driven rotor to enter production. Two years later it was followed in Germany by the twin-rotor Focke Achgelis Fa 223 Drache (Kite) transport helicopter and in America by the Sikorsky R-4.Wood and Gunston (1977) The R-4 was far the most-produced type and was introduced into RAF service as the Hoverfly I, where it was progressively replacing the Avro Rota autogyro by the end of hostilities.Munson, K.; \\"Helicopters and other rotorcraft since 1907,\\" Blandford, Revised Edition, 1973. =Engines= Engine power and aircraft performance increased steadily throughout the war, with liquid-cooled inline and vee engines competing with air-cooled radials much as they had competed with air-cooled rotary types in the First War. As an example, at the start of the war the Rolls-Royce Merlin III liquid-cooled V-12 engine developed just 1,000 hp while at the end its derivative the Rolls-Royce Griffon 61 offered 2,035 hp.Gingell (1976), Page 47. In the early stages of the war German fighters, especially the Messerschmitt Bf 109, were very fast and maneuverable and had the advantage over the British types of a fuel- injected engine. This allowed them to fly upside-down or to perform other negative-G manoeuvres without fear of the engine cutting out, as happened to the British types fitted with carburettors. On the other hand, the carburettor combined with a turbocharger gave better performance at altitude.Gingell (1976) However, as the war wore on, Germany's critical inability to produce piston aviation engines of at least 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) maximum power and above that possessed proven front-line reliability, prevented them from fully developing more advanced strategic and tactical combat aircraft designs that would require such powerplants. Meanwhile, jet and rocket engines had been under steady development, the rocket especially in Germany and the jet both there and in Britain. By the end of the war they were beginning to make their appearance in operational types. The German and British jet technologies differed significantly. The axial-flow jet, in which air passes continuously backwards through the engine, was recognized as the most efficient design but required highly advanced new technologies in both materials and precision manufacture. While the Germans opted for this approach, the British chose the simpler and more robust centrifugal compressor in which the air is first flung outwards, using centrifugal force to help compress it, before being burned and returned to the axial-flow turbine stage. This resulted in a shorter but wider engine for the same airflow and output power. The Hungarian Jendrassik Cs-1, in 1940 the world's first turboprop, was of axial-flow design with similarly revered-flow combustion but was cancelled due to other priorities.Green, W. and Swanborough, G.; \\"Plane Facts\\", Air Enthusiast Vol. 1 No. 1 (1971), Page 53. The pulse jet was a crude jet engine which produced too much vibration to be usable for manned aircraft but found a niche in the V-1 flying bomb. =Armament= At the start of the war, the British Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters had eight machine guns against typically four on the Messerschmitt Bf 109, giving them far greater firepower. The early marks of Spitfire and Hurricane had machine guns that were, however, of the .30 calibre (7.62mm) class, with less hitting power than heavier calibre weapons firing non-explosive bullets - the Germans' MG 131 machine gun, the Japanese Ho-103 machine gun, the Soviets' Berezin UB and particularly the \\"light- barrel\\" AN/M2 version of the American Browning M2 machine gun, all of the .50 calibre (12.7mm) size, became very widely used as primary offensive and defensive aircraft armament by the end of World War II. The Bf 109 could also be fitted with a cannon, and later variants with up to three. These guns have exploding shells instead of solid bullets but are larger and heavier than ordinary machine guns and opinions differed on both sides as to which type was better. Some aircraft were made in both variants, while others could be modified in the field to fit either or both types. As the war progressed, higher aircraft speeds, cockpit armour and stronger airframes led to a steadily increasing preference for cannon.Galland (1973).Bader (1975). Later in the war the British and American forces made extensive use of unguided rockets for ground attack, while the German Bachem Natter point-defence interceptor had a battery of rockets in the nose intended to be fired into an oncoming bomber formation. =Avionics= Avionics systems increased in sophistication and became more widespread, including power-assisted flight controls, blind flying instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking. Ground activities =Manufacturing= Aircraft manufacturing remained a high priority throughout the war for all the key combatants and was a major part of their economic output. Women, and in Germany slave labour, were extensively employed due to the military call-up of able-bodied men. Due to the threat of bombing, especially in Europe, manufacturing became progressively more dispersed. When British and American bombing raids started in earnest, Germany moved much of its production into underground factories. Strategic materials such as aluminium for airframes and petroleum oil for fuel were in limited supply and soon became scarce. Many manufacturers, especially in the Soviet Union and, later on, in Germany turned to more readily-available raw materials such as timber and coal. The de Havilland Mosquito fighter- bomber was a rare British example of a wooden aeroplane. =Airfields= At the outbreak of war there were relatively few aerodromes capable of supporting military aircraft operations. Land-based aircraft with retracting undercarriage had superior performance to the equivalent seaplanes, leading to the widespread construction of aerodromes throughout all theatres of campaign. After the war many of these would become civil airports, providing the basis for a move of long-range passenger flights from flying boats to landplanes.Munson, K.; \\"Flying boats and seaplanes,\\" Blandford (1971), Page 12. The increasing sophistication of warplanes meant that ground facilities also became more sophisticated. The high-powered engines in use could no longer be started by hand-swinging the propeller, but powered starting systems had to be provided, whether mechanical as with the Hucks starter or electrical as with the wheeled battery pack or trolley accumulator used for aircraft such as the Spitfire, which had an inbuilt electric starter motor. Military aviation Aviation during this period was dominated by the conduct of the war, and the war in turn by air power. Aviation was heavily involved in the development of military technologies, strategies, tactics and events throughout the war. At the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939, the German Luftwaffe had amassed an attack force of modern all-metal cantilever monoplanes designed to support the Blitzkrieg style of warfare at relatively short range and manufactured by a large and organised industry. Pilots had been well-trained, both in flying clubs and in some cases the Spanish Civil War. Other European air forces, especially the British RAF were struggling to re-equip with similarly modern types and to train up aircrew. Early German successes, with the notable assistance of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber, overran Europe and left Britain open to attack. During the ensuing Battle of Britain, the British fighter squadrons had to quickly relearn the old tactical lessons from the first war. Initially the RAF fighters flew in a tight three- fighter arrowhead formation, soon changing to the looser four-aircraft arrangement which the Germans called the \\"finger-four.\\" They soon also relearned the value of climbing above your opponent before attacking. At the same time, the development of an early radar warning system by the British provided a new way to track German attack formations as they gathered over the European coast and flew across the English Channel. The radio communications, provided to every pilot, also required new protocols such as radio silence before engaging the enemy. Later on, the British and Americans developed large long-range heavy bombers, causing great damage to the German war effort and substantial casualties. While the British favoured unescorted night bombing, the Americans preferred to mount daytime raids, escorted by long-range fighters. In the Pacific war, both sides made extensive use of aircraft carriers and carrier-to-carrier engagements became pivotal turning points in several campaigns. Civil aviation Civil aviation continued in non- combatant countries. In countries engaged in warfare, many civilian aircraft were pressed into military service. Some civilian operations were maintained, for example BOAC continued making overseas passenger flights, often camouflaging its aircraft.

Freemasons trained in masonry assisted the President in laying the cornerstones. Hoover personally oversaw the dedication of the cornerstone at the Labor end of the building. His words were broadcast over loudspeaker to the workers at the ICC end of the structure, who placed the ICC cornerstone simultaneously at the President's instruction (becoming the first time in Washington history that a single person dedicated two cornerstones at the same time). William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), attended the laying of the cornerstone for the Labor building. The building was designated by Congress as a contributing structure to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site in 1966, and it was subsequently listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Agency occupants The Department of Labor was the original occupant of the building. It vacated the building in 1979 when its employees moved to the Frances Perkins Building.

Plot Thee, a struggling 40-year-old marketing officer, moves from Bangkok to Laddaland, an upmarket housing estate located in Chiang Mai, bringing along his wife, Parn, his rebellious teenage daughter, Nan, and lively young son, Nat. Thee is certain that the move is the best option to answer all of his financial problems relating to the company he works for, which sells dietary supplements, despite his wife's concern over the hefty mortgage payments required to purchase the new house. Thee also hopes to mend his relationship with Nan, who is resentful of her parents due to spending much of her life with her maternal grandmother as per an agreement between Thee and Parn's mother ‚Äî Nan was born out of wedlock when her parents were still in high school, and Parn's mother, who never accepts Parn's relationship with Thee, demands Nan in return for their continued relationship. Nan is unimpressed despite Thee's best efforts to make good of the situation and wishes to return to her grandmother. While Laddaland appears to be a relatively ordinary, if quiet, neighborhood, Thee and his family realize that something is wrong with the environs, since the place seems to sow discord on the families to commit violence. A Burmese housemaid is found dead in a grisly murder. Somkiat, Thee's next-door neighbor, regularly beats his wife and son while mistreating his elderly mother; the entirety of the family eventually perish when Somkiat commits murder suicide, with his son's death being the most horrific as he disfigures his face by vertically cutting it. Meanwhile, Nan experiences supernatural phenomena when she is swayed by her friends to visit the house where the Burmese maid was killed, but Thee's inability to believe them causes her to move to her boarding school until the end of her term. Thee and Parn also eventually succumb to the discord, Thee because of his discovery that his company is a fraud and his boss is taking away all of his money, forcing him to work in odd jobs such as being a shop clerk, and Parn because of the stress of Nan's absence and her own supernatural experiences. Nat is the only one who remains uncorrupted from the violence and is happy to live there, but his friendship with an imaginary friend that turns out to be Somkiat's deceased son only worries Parn even further. The dysfunction reaches its nadir when Nan, on the day of her return from boarding school, is haunted by the spirit of Somkiat's wife and mother next door and has to stay at a mental hospital so she can be calmed down. Parn lashes out at Thee and says that she and the children will move back to her mother. Thee discovers Nat missing that night and searches Somkiat's house, where he is haunted by the spirit of Somkiat's son. He is followed by Parn, who finds Thee shooting at a wardrobe where Nat is hiding in his hide-and-seek game with Somkiat's son. Nat survives the shot, but Thee, thinking that he had killed his son, commits suicide. Parn drives her children back to her mother in Bangkok after the tragedy. She recounts to Nan of how she became accustomed to Thee, how she lost her dreams when she discovered her pregnancy, and how in spite of everything, Thee always tries to do his best and love his family. The film ends with flashbacks showing Thee and his family in happier times. Release Ladda Land was released in Thailand on April 28, 2011. The film received an international premiere at the 17th Busan International Film Festival on October 11, 2011. Laddaland was a big hit in Thailand where it premiered at number one in its first week, beating out the American film Thor. The film was shown for six weeks in Thailand where it grossed a total of $3,877,740. The Hollywood Reporter suggested in their review that the film was such a big hit in Thailand due to circumstances in the film being based on an actual condo development in Chiang Mai that is rumoured to be haunted. Reception Variety gave the Laddaland as positive review referring to it as \\"tasty T-horror\\" and that it was a \\"well-made chiller is ideal for fest sidebars, and should reap strong worldwide ancillary.\\" The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, referring to the film as \\"sleekly designed\\" but that \\"some of the CGI are rough round the edges\\". The reviewer felt that Laddaland was also inferior compared to the Thai horror films Shutter (2004) and Alone (2007). Film Business Asia echoed The Hollywood Reporter's sentiments gave the film the a 6 out of 10 rating, and stating that it was a \\"technically effective horror movie\\" but one that \\"leaves the audience short-changed on a story level.\\" Laddaland won six awards at the Thailand National Film Association Awards.

Based on the hazard and exposure considerations, the risk assessment conducted by Health Canada concluded that C. maltaromaticum strain CB1 is not considered to be toxic to the Canadian environment or human health as described in Section 64 of CEPA 1999.http://www.ec.gc.ca/subsnouvelles- newsubs/default.asp?lang=En&n;=5F5B3F64-1  References  External links *Genus Carnobacterium at Bacterio.net Category:Lactobacillales Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Carnobacterium"},{"id":"33703801","text":"Cyllene (1895‚Äì1925) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career that lasted from 1897 until 1899, Cyllene won nine of his eleven starts, winning major races and being regarded as the best horse of his generation at two, three and four years of age. In a stud career which began in Britain and ended in Argentina, Cyllene became an important and influential stallion. He sired four winners of The Derby and is the direct male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. Background Cyllene, a chestnut horse with a white stripe and two white socks was bred by his owner, Charles Day Rose at the Hardwicke Stud near Pangbourne in Berkshire. He was a small, late foal, born in May and was never entered in the Classics as he was thought unlikely to be strong or mature enough to compete at the highest level at an early age. Cyllene was trained throughout his racing career by William Jarvis at Waterwitch House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Rose thought so highly of Cyllene that he arranged a \\"luxurious\\" private train to ensure that the colt returned to Newmarket promptly after his races. Cyllene's most regular rider was the 1899 Champion Jockey Sam Loates. Cyllene's sire, Bona Vista was a high class racehorse who won the 2000 Guineas in 1892. He was considered a failure as a stallion and in the year of Cyllene's birth he was sold and exported to Hungary. Arcadia, Cyllene's dam, won two races and was a half sister to Van Dieman's Land, who ran third in the Derby. Racing career =1897: two- year-old season= In the spring of 1897, Cyllene won small races at Liverpool and Gatwick \\"in good style\\". He was then sent to Ascot for the Triennial Stakes where he defeated Nun Nicer, a filly who won the following year's 1000 Guineas, establishing himself as one of the best of an apparently \\"above the average\\" generation. At Sandown in July he won the National Breeders' Produce Stakes by a head to take one of the season's most valuable two-year-old prizes, despite being unable to obtain a clear run until the closing stages. After a break of three months he returned to the racecourse in October for the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse in which he narrowly failed to give ten pounds to Dieudonne, a colt who went on to win the Middle Park Stakes later in the month. =1898: three-year-old season= As he was ineligible to run in the Classics, Cyllene's three-year-old campaign was somewhat restricted. He was disappointing on his debut, finishing third at odds of 2/11 in the Column Produce Stakes at Newmarket in April but was never beaten again. In May he easily won the Newmarket Stakes by four lengths in record time, and was then rested until autumn. Before he returned, the form of his Newmarket win was boosted when Jeddah, who had finished fifth in the race, won The Derby. In September he produced his best performance to date to win the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket by six lengths from a field which included Dieudonne and the Classic winners Airs and Graces and Chelandry. On his final start of the year he won the Sandown Park Foal Stakes by four lengths, taking his winnings for the season to ¬£14,563. =1899: four-year-old season= Cyllene's four-year-old season was compressed into a three-day period in June at Royal Ascot. At the start of the meeting he won the Triennial Stakes which served as a warm-up for the Ascot Gold Cup two days later. Racing over two and a half miles in the Gold Cup, Cyllene turned the race into a \\"procession\\", taking the lead two furlongs out and pulling clear to win by eight lengths from Lord Edward and the Prix du Jockey Club winner Gardefeu. According to one correspondent, Cyllene \\"simply played\\" with the top quality field, with his jockey Sam Loates having time to stroke the horse's neck and touch his cap to the cheering crowd in the closing stages. The effects two races on firm ground meant that Cyllene's connections abandoned plans to run him for a third time at the meeting (in the Hardwicke Stakes) and the colt was given an extended rest. In autumn there was much anticipation of a meeting between Cyllene and the Triple Crown winner Flying Fox, with Charles Day Rose being reported as saying that he \\"looked forward to beating\\" the outstanding three-year-old in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. When Cyllene returned to serious training however, it was decided that the risk of the horse breaking down was too great and he was retired to stud without racing again. Assessment Assessing the two-year-olds of 1897, at least one correspondent believed that Cyllene was \\"on sheer merit\\" the best of a \\"pretty smart lot\\". At the end of his three- year-old season there was little doubt that Cyllene was the best horse of his generation in England, with the only debate concerning the identity of the second best. An \\"English turf writer\\" confidently asserted that if Cyllene had been entered in the Classics he would have \\"swept the board\\" and been regarded as a \\"second Ormonde\\". In June 1899, shortly before his runs at Royal Ascot, Cyllene was rated by the Daily Mail's correspondent as one of the three best horses in England, alongside the Australian-bred Newhaven and the three-year- old Flying Fox. At the end of the season another correspondent rated him the second best horse of the year behind Flying Fox. Stud career =England= Cyllene stood as a stallion at the Hardwicke Stud from 1900 until 1905. He was then sold for 30,000 gns to William Bass and was moved to the Egerton Park Stud at Newmarket where he was based until 1908. He was not a popular stallion at first, and attracted relatively few top class mares despite a modest stud fee of between 100 and 150 gns. Despite this he soon proved to be outstandingly successful, siring the Derby winners Cicero, Minoru, Tagalie and Lemberg. More important in the long term was Polymelus who sired three Derby winners (Fifinella, Pommern and Humorist) and Phalaris, the most influential sire of the 20th Century. =Argentina= In January 1908 Cyllene was sold for ¬£25,000 to the Ojo de Agua in Argentina and was exported in July. After his departure Cyllene's progeny made him Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in both 1909 and 1910,. In Argentina he was Champion sire in 1913 and got the winners of four Argentinian classics. Cyllene died at the age of thirty in 1925 and was buried at the Ojo de Agua cemetery.

It is an extended episode. It aired on MTV on November 10, 2011, along with \\"Drones\\", another extended episode. Plot Beavis and Butt-Head are seen in Mr. Stevenson's garage, playing with his tools. After Stewart says not to play with his dad's tools, they ignore him and Beavis starts screwing a screw into an action figure's butt. Beavis, not realizing the screw would go into hand, starts bleeding from his hand after screwing it. Butt-Head tries to remove it with a drill, but he accidentally tightens the screw, penetrating Beavis' other hand as well. Stewart tells him to take Beavis to the hospital. At the hospital, Beavis gets the action figure and the screw removed from his hands. Beavis is given painkillers, but against the doctor's advice he takes several at once and he transforms into his alter-ego, The Great Cornholio (or simply Cornholio). A group of cultists in the hospital notice that Cornholio speaks in tongues and has a hole in each of his hands and mistakes them for stigmatas, thinking he is the new messiah. After taking Cornholio and Butt- Head to a cult meeting, Cornholio demands large quantities of toilet paper. The cult members start to look wherever they can for toilet paper for Cornholio. Cornholio addresses the cult members until his hyperness wears off and he becomes Beavis again. The duo decide that the place sucks and they leave without realizing that they had a chance of having sex with the women there. The next day, the cult members come to the duo's house and Beavis tells them that Stewart is now the beloved and the duo are oblivious to the fact that they are actually taking Stewart for sex, much to his delight.

The species is restricted to equatorial Africa. Taxonomy and etymology Jameson's mamba was first described in 1843 by Thomas Traill, a physician, doctor, zoologist and scholar of medical jurisprudence. In 1936, in addition to the nominotypical subspecies D. jamesoni jamesoni, Arthur Loveridge described a new subspecies D. jamesoni kaimosae; the latter is commonly referred to as the eastern Jameson's mamba or the black-tailed Jameson's mamba. The origins of the specific name, jamesoni, are not fully understood, but it is possible that Traill named the species in honour of Robert Jameson (1774‚Äì1854), who was a contemporary of Traill's and was the Regius Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh University where Traill studied.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Dendroaspis jamesoni, p. 133). Also, Traill was a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society, which was founded by Jameson.Scholarly Societies Project , Wernerian Natural History Society. The subspecies D. jamesoni kaimosae takes its subspecific name from the type locality, the Kaimosi Forest in western Kenya. Analysis of the components of the venom of all mambas places Jameson's mamba as sister species to the western green mamba. Description thumb Jameson's mamba is a large, slender elapid snake with smooth scales and a long tapering tail which typically accounts for 20 to 25% of its total length. The average total length (including tail) of an adult snake is approximately to . It may grow as large as . Adults tend to be dull green across the back, blending to pale green towards the underbelly with scales generally edged with black.Clinical Toxinology Resource (Dendroaspis jamesoni ) The ventral side, neck and throat are typically cream or yellowish in colour. Jameson's mamba has a narrow and elongated head containing a small eye and round pupil. Like the western green mamba, the neck may be flattened. The subspecies D. jamesoni kaimosae, which is typically found in the eastern part of the species' range, features a black tail, while central and western examples typically have a pale green or yellow tail. No significant sexual dimorphism has been observed between male and female snakes. =Scalation= The head, body and tail scalation of the Jameson's mamba: *Dorsal scale rows at midbody: 15‚Äì17 *Ventrals: 202‚Äì222 *Subcaudals: 94‚Äì106 *Anal plate: Divided *Upper labials: 8 *Upper labial touching eye: 4th *Preoculars: 3 *Postoculars: 3 *Subocular: 1 Distribution and habitat Jameson's mamba occurs mostly in Central Africa and West Africa, and in some parts of East Africa. In Central Africa it can be found from Angola northwards to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and as far north as the Imatong Mountains of South Sudan. In West Africa it ranges from Ghana eastwards to Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. In East Africa it can be found in Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. The subspecies D. jamesoni kaimosae is endemic to East Africa and chiefly found in western Kenya, where its type locality is located, as well as in Uganda, Rwanda and adjacent Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a relatively common and widespread snake, particularly across its western range. Found in primary and secondary rainforests, woodland, forest-savanna and deforested areas at elevations up to high, Jameson's mamba is an adaptable species, found in areas where there has been extensive deforestation and human development. It is often found around buildings, town parks, farmlands and plantations. Jameson's mamba is a highly arboreal snake, more so than its close relatives the eastern green mamba and western green mamba, and significantly more so than the black mamba. Behaviour and ecology Jameson's mamba is a highly agile and almost exclusively arboreal snake. Like other mambas it is capable of flattening its neck in mimicry of a cobra when it feels threatened, and its body shape and length give an ability to strike at significant range. It is not typically aggressive in nature and will almost always attempt to escape. =Diet and predators= Jameson's mamba will chase prey, similar to other mamba species. When prey is caught, Jameson's mamba will strike until the prey dies. Since this species is arboreal, birds make up a large portion of its diet. Small mammals such as mice, rats, and bats and small lizards are also preyed upon. The main predators of this species are various birds of prey, including the martial eagle, bateleur, and the Congo serpent eagle. Other predators may include the honey badger, other snakes, and species of mongoose may also occasionally prey on the Jameson's mamba. Venom Like other mambas, the venom of the Jameson's mamba is a highly neurotoxic venom. Its other components include cardiotoxins, and fasciculins. Its venom may also have hemotoxic and myotoxic components to it. The average venom yield per bite for this species is 80 mg, but some specimens may yield as much as 120 mg in a single bite. The SC for this species according to Brown (1973) is 1.0 mg/kg, while the IV is 0.8 mg/kg. Untreated envenomation may cause death within 30 to 120 minutes. However, the average death time for untreated bite victims is usually two to three hours post-envenomation, but it may take up to four to six hours or longer. The mortality rate of untreated bites is not exactly known, but it is said to be very high.

The district was rebranded the Centennial Park District and is now under the management of Central Atlanta Progress. The area was mostly one of industrial and warehouse use (see map) and was in decline after the mid-20th century, even after Centennial Olympic Park was built for the 1996 Olympics. Developer Legacy's stated goals were to create a district within Downtown Atlanta that would contain entertainment, hotel accommodations and restaurants all within walking distance of each other and of the nearby Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Philips Arena, Georgia World Congress Center, CNN Center, World of Coca-Cola and Georgia Aquarium. It would lure visitors to stay, dine, and be entertained near those facilities and attractions instead of in the Peachtree Center area of Downtown or even Buckhead. Whereas a few years prior, few facilities existed in the area, by 2011, the district counted 25 restaurants and 6 hotels, the Ventana events center and a helipad. The area is set to add the College Football Hall of Fame and Times Square South to its roster of attractions. Currently the District is home to a variety of attractions, restaurants and lounges, event spaces, hotels, and office and retail spaces. College Football Hall of Fame The College Football Hall of Fame moved to a new facility on the southwest side of Marietta Street, between Foundry and Baker Streets, and opened in 2014.

It became one of the many small battles fought on American soil during the Mexican Revolution and resulted in an increased effort by the United States Army to defend the international border. At least seven people were killed in the raid and several more from among those wounded by gunfire may have died immediately afterwards. Background In January 1915 a group of Mexican rebels drafted the Plan of San Diego which called for Mexicans in the American border states to rebel against the U.S. government and kill the white inhabitants. However, the overall plan was unrealistic and changed many times so the Seditionistas, as they were called, only launched small raids into Texas from the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Norias Ranch is located about seventy miles north of Brownsville and about sixty miles from Kingsville. At the time, Norias was the headquarters for the southernmost portion of the 825,000-acre King Ranch and was also used by the Missouri Pacific Railroad to water their trains. The site itself resembled a small town; it included a large two story wooden ranch house, owned by Caesar Kleberg, a small train station, a section house, a corral and a few other buildings. On August 7, Caesar Kleberg was in Kingsville when he learned that a large group of armed Mexican men were riding on horseback through the Sauz grazing division of the King Ranch with the intention of attacking Norias. Kleberg immediately informed the United States Army commandant at Fort Brown, near Brownsville, Texas, who informed Adjutant General Henry Hutchings. Hutchings organized a force of thirteen Texas Rangers, including Captains Harry (or Henry) Ransom, Monroe Fox, and George J. Head, plus eight cavalrymen, under Corporal Watson Adams, to go to the Norias Ranch by train and investigate the situation. Upon arriving, a ranch foreman named Tom Tate led Hutchings, the Texas Rangers, and a few local peace officers to the Sauz Ranch. While they were gone a second train arrived at about 5:30 pm, dropping off the Customs Inspectors D. P. Gay, Joe Taylor, and Marcus Hinds, as well as a deputy sheriff of Cameron County, Gordon Hill. All four were heavily armed with rifles and pistols.Cavazos, pg. 8-14 Raid Now there were a total of seventeen men, four women and one baby girl at the ranch, including Sheriff Hill, the eight soldiers, the three customs inspectors, four male ranchers and one railroad foreman. Later that night, as the sun was going down, the people at Norias had just finished eating dinner when they retired to the porch of the ranch house. Shortly thereafter, Inspector Hinds noticed a group of men on horseback approaching the ranch from the south, displaying a red flag. Initially he thought the men were Texas Rangers, returning from their patrol, but when they closed to about 250 yards away they opened fire on the house. At the same time, a second group of rebels attacked from the east and opened fire within ninety yards of the Americans as they took cover behind the railroad embankment near the section house to return the fire. One of the ranchers, a black man named Albert Edmonds, telephoned Caesar Kleberg, asking for his help. Kleberg told Edmonds that there was a train in Kingsville loaded with \\"armed men, supplies, and medical people\\" but it could not leave because there was no one yet available to drive it to Norias. When the train did finally arrive the fighting was already over. The four women dispersed when the shooting began. One hid inside a boxcar with her husband, the railroad foreman, and her baby while two others went into the ranch house. A fourth woman, named Manuela Flores, hid inside the section house. Within the first few minutes of the battle, four of the Americans were wounded, including two soldiers and the ranchers George Forbes and Frank Martin. Forbes got hit in the lungs as he was bringing the wounded into the house, and both he and Frank Martin would later die of their wounds. Dad Martin, the father of Frank, shot and killed the horse of the Mexican commander and stopped the initial charge, but the rebels dismounted and regrouped for a second attack on foot. Eventually the Americans withdrew to the safety of the ranch house but its thin walls provided little protection. Because of this, Dad Martin had the two women and the wounded covered in mattresses while he and the remaining men went back outside to draw the Mexicans' fire away from the house. Once outside the Americans took cover behind a roll of wire fencing and a steel trough. When they returned fire the rebels took cover in the section house, a second building nearby, and from behind a pile of railroad ties. It was at this time that Manuela Flores was found hiding and subsequently killed by the raiders. When the defenders began to run low on ammunition Dad Martin ran from behind the wires back inside the house. He first checked on the women and the wounded, telling them to stay down under the mattresses and then he retrieved the ammunition and went back outside to distribute it. All of this was done under a \\"steady stream of bullets\\" but Dad would survive the two-hour engagement unhurt. Towards the end of the fight, the Mexicans launched one final charge on foot to dislodge the defenders before the sun set, but they were beaten back again, having made it to within forty yards of the Americans' position. During the charge, Inspector Joe Taylor shot and killed the rebel leader; however, it remains uncertain as to who the leader actually was. After being repulsed again the Mexicans retreated to their horses and strapped the wounded to them. According to the ranchers Pedro Longorio, Luis Solis, and Macario Longorio, at 2:00 am, on August 9, a group of fifty-two rebels, under the command of Antonio Roche and Dario Morada, forced them to feed and water their horses at the Cerritos division of the King Ranch. Another report says that Luis de la Rosca led some of the raiders and that his band of fifteen men joined with about twenty-five others for the attack on Norias. Either way, there were between forty-five and seventy Mexican rebels who participated in the fight, at least four of whom were killed and as many as twelve others were wounded.Weber, pg. 89-90 Aftermath Capt. Monroe Fox and two other Rangers on horseback with their lariats around the bodies of dead Mexican bandits, after the Norias Ranch Raid August 8, 1915 The Americans reported that they had killed five of the Mexicans but only four appear in pictures taken of the dead on the following morning of August 9 when Hutchings and the Texas Rangers returned. However, Dad Martin claimed that he was tasked with burying the bodies of ten rebels at the ranch on the day after the raid and that the five wounded Mexicans who were strapped to horses later died and were buried by their comrades somewhere on the ranch. One of the men at Norias tried to have Hutchings and the rangers pursue the raiders but by the time they were finished having their photographs taken with the dead rebels, the remaining raiders had fled across the Rio Grande into Mexico. While crossing at a place called Los Cavazos, the rebels encountered United States Army troops and some other Texas Rangers. During another brief fight, as many as a dozen more rebels were killed, with very few actually making it back to Mexico. A wounded rebel later said that he and the others thought there were only a few men at the ranch and that they planned to rob the store, destroy the night train, and burn Kleberg's ranch house. Dad Martin later discovered that the rebels had placed a price on his head when he captured a Mexican bounty hunter. Dad searched the Mexican and in his pocket he found a piece of paper with his name on it, as well as the names of the others who defended Norias and that of Caesar Kleberg and his father Bob. Next to the names was written down the amount of reward money offered for each victim.

History The theater was founded in October 1984 as Alias Stage by seven members of the graduating class of Trinity Rep Conservatory. They performed at the Riverside Mills in Providence's Olneyville neighborhood, but that space was destroyed by a fire on December 18, 1989. Alias reopened at the Atlantic Mills with a production of \\"The Dragon\\" on January 18, 1990, immediately adjacent to the Riverside Mills. The group moved to a semi-permanent garage space in the Providence Jewelry District in 1994, backed by a board of directors. In 1998, the theater staged its last performance as the Alias Stage with King Lear. They then changed their name to the Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre after receiving a donation of $100,000 from Alan Shawn Feinstein in memory of his sister. The theater remained in the cramped Jewelry District until October 2002, when they were in need of a larger space and financial re-organization. The Gamm announced a hiatus following a production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Shortly after, they hired Tony Estrella as Artistic Director and Yvonne Seggerman as managing director, and the Gamm reopened in November 2003 with a 135-seat house in an old police garage, part of the Pawtucket Armory Center. Their 34th season, in 2018‚Äì2019, was the first full season after relocating from Pawtucket to their new, permanent home on Jefferson Boulevard in Warwick at the old Ocean State Theatre building. A renovation is underway while they still produce their 35th season in 2019‚Äì2020, using elements of the original building fused with newer elements and technology to upgrade the theatre on a full scale. An additional 30 square feet will allow for a dedicated backstage space, dedicated wing space, a portable lighting and sound booth and a state- of-the-art rigging system. In addition, an on-site production workshop will mean that, for the first time, The Gamm's designers and production team will have a full array of artistic resources to bring new imaginative worlds to the stage. With an innovative, flexible design, the studio theatre's stage will be able to shift from partial thrust to full Shakespearean courtyard or an in- the-round stage. And the back wall of the studio box can open up to create a 300-seat traditional proscenium theater.

It lies on the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway. The station is known for a train crash in 1997, when a freight train with 22 petrol tankers derailed and exploded on the station premises. Infrastructure  The station has had three platform edges since its reconstruction in the 1990s: *the main platform next to the station building, which is 300 m long and 55 cm high, *an island platform, which is 300 m long and 38 cm high. An underpass that is reached by stairs connects the island platform with the main platform. History Friedrich Jage, a master mason and later an honorary citizen of Elsterwerda, built the then three-storey station building according to the specifications of the Berlin-Dresden Railway Company (Berlin-Dresdener Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft) in \\"American\\"-style timber construction. The station was opened with the Berlin-Dresden railway on 17 June 1875 without a public opening ceremony. The first railway station master was a Mr Bruttloff. Excursion trains ran from Berlin to Dresden for an industrial exhibition on 10 and 17 July 1875. The 22 kilometre-long Riesa‚ÄìElsterwerda railway was opened on 15 October 1875. In the following years, the railway became one of the strongest economic enterprises of the city and due to the good rail connections several industrial companies settled in Elsterwerda and nearby Biehla, causing significant population growth. The population increased from 1,739 in 1871 to 2,537 in 1895 and 4,224 in 1910. The station building in 1923 The station building in 2006 A highlight of the station was a visit by Wilhelm II, German Emperor on a special train on 27 August 1888, which stopped for about ten minutes at the station. There was a proposal in March 1894 for the construction of a railway line from Elsterwerda to Kamenz, but this was never realised, like many other railway projects at that time. Because the station was a border station between Prussia and Saxony, the operation of the station was shared between Prussian and Saxon officials. According to a personnel list of 21 November 1912, 129 Prussian and 24 Saxon railwaymen were employed in the station‚Äôs freight facilities. It was later said in the town that the Prussian and Saxon officials threw inkwells during disputes. In 1914, there were plans to build a railway line from Burxdorf via Elsterwerda to Ortrand and preliminary talks were held to promote the sale of the shares of the proposed company. This project eventually failed at the end of the 1920s. The first air raids on Elsterwerda were carried out by the Allies in April 1945 and the town was attacked by low-flying aircraft. The station and its facilities were bombed on 19 April 1945. An ammunition train that was stopped in the station was hit, caused explosions that caused severe damage on the railway premises and to the centre of the town. The upper storey of the station building was badly damaged and it was not subsequently rebuilt. After the end of the Second World War, clean-up and repair work on the railway premises soon began and so on 11 May 1945, the first train ran from the bridge over the Elbe in Niederwartha near Dresden via Elsterwerda to Berlin. As early as July 1945, 210 railwaymen were employed in Elsterwerda. Later, the administration of Elsterwerda station, which included the Elsterwerda locomotive depot and Elsterwerda-Biehla station, employed about 1,000 railway workers. After the reunification of Germany, there were radical changes at the Elsterwerda precinct and it lost its significance. The locomotive depot was closed and the operation of locomotives was moved to other locations. A similar fate also affected the track maintenance operations. Employees were dismissed or transferred. The station building was reconstructed from 1988 to 1991, receiving a completely different look. The new station layout was completed in March 1992. A siding runs from the station into the industrial area of Elsterwerda-West and there is also a container terminal. Memorial stone at Elsterwerda station =Train Derailment and Fire of 1997= There was a serious accident affecting the entire station area and the adjacent depot on 20 November 1997, when a freight train with 22 petrol-filled tank cars derailed at a set of points due to overspeed (90 km/h where 40 were ordered). Two ensuing explosions of the wagons and the huge fire caused severe damage to the station's buildings, infrastructure, the first fire trucks, other cars and the precinct. Two firefighters were killed by the explosion that happened after they arrived, and several others had to be treated for burns in hospital. A memorial stone was later erected in their honour in the grounds of the station. In total, 30 fire departmentsTranslating \\"Feuerwehren\\" with fire departments is not exact at best, and the earlier might as well mean fire stations or \\"L√∂schz√ºge\\" (two fire engines with full equipment and 18 personnel, plus other vehicles like a ladder; something like a fire company?) responded with 310 firefighters (working in shifts) and 62 vehicles, their operation lasted for 34 hours. Emergency rescue services attended with 14 vehicles and two helicopters. The accident investigation revealed: An engine replacement at the previous stop, Berlin-Gr√ºnau, in the middle of the night, required testing of the brakes. But several errors (lack of attention, misperception, deficient communication) by the driver and the assigned train preparation technician occurred. The first error, caused by the driver, was to not connect the main brake's hoses and to not open the respective valves after coupling the engine to the first wagon. Filling the brake system by the engine happened far too fast, without the driver noticing. The irresponsive, still activated brakes were misdiagnosed by the technician (who had to service three trains at the same time) to have a pressure higher than what the engine supplied. He did not report this to the driver, but reset the brakes by emptying their air reservoirs. The actual brake test never happened, but the driver later claimed to have received a positive confirmation. The technician, in turn, did not abort the departure of the train. As the result, the train left with all brakes dysfunctional, except the ones of the engine. This emerged as late as the train had to slow down before entering Elsterwerda station. The heavily damaged engine shed was later demolished and never rebuilt. The substantially damaged station building was renovated. 600 metric tonnes of petrol seeped into the soil and the sewage system during the disaster, and even after ten years, petrol was still being filtered out of the ground. In 2004, the station forecourt was completely rebuilt. Several of the buildings in this area were demolished and replaced by greenery and platforms for the bus station. The new works were formally inaugurated on 5 August 2004. Prospects From mid-2014 until mid-2015, 3.6 km of track and seven sets of points at the station are being renewed, the pedestrian underpass is being rebuilt with two lifts and a new 320 m long island platform is being built, while other tracks and sets are being dismantled. Between June 2014 and June 2016, it is intended that an electronic interlocking will be built for the Elsterwerda and Hohenleipisch area. Signalling on the 6 km-long section is to be replaced by the end of 2016.

Mosse Humanities building. Music Hall Music Hall This Victorian Gothic building, built in 1878 and initially named Assembly Hall, was designed by architect David R. Jones of Madison to house an 800-seat auditorium, a library, and a clock tower. Dedicated on March 2, 1880, the building originally held conventions, dances, and commencement ceremonies, along with its primary purpose of a library. After the library moved to a different building on campus, a portion of the hall was assigned to the School of Music in 1900. Shortly after renovations in the early 1900s, the building was officially named Music Hall in 1910. It remains an important music venue and is home to the university opera. This building also is home to the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, with part of the building being used as office space and classrooms.

Origins Mullen was born to Denis Mullen (1806‚Äì86) and Ellen Mulray (1816‚Äì88) in Ballinasloe, County Galway in June 1847. John had an older brother Patrick (born 1844), as well as younger siblings Ella (born 1849), Denis (born 1850), Kate (born 1853) and another who didn't survive. During the 1820s and 1830s, John's father Denis and uncle Thomas Mullen, \\"crafted barrels for the mills\\" of Ballinasloe, which had three oatmeal mills, two breweries and a flour mill. However, the advent of the Great Famine brought an end to whatever prosperity the family enjoyed. Emigrate to U.S. In 1856, the family emigrated to the United States, arriving in Boston. They settled at Oriskany Falls, Oneida County, New York, where Denis and Thomas purchased houses adjacent to each other, and close to the town mill, where John Mullen first worked at age fourteen. He soon dropped out of school to help support the family. At his first job with the Oriskany Flour Mill, he learned the operation and won the respect of the owner, who placed Mullen in charge of the mill before he was twenty. In 1867, Mullen headed west looking for a mill in need of a miller. He spent time in Illinois and Atchison, Kansas. He settled in Troy, Kansas, where he was in charge of the Banner Flour Mills, owned by Tracey and Parker Company. In the fall of 1871, Mullen left for Denver, where he worked for West Denver Flour Mill owned by O. W Shackleton and Charles Davis. Businessman In 1875, Mullen decided to operate his own mill. Mullen leased the old Star Mill in north Denver as a partnership with Theodore Seth. After a year, he bought him out and the company became J.K. Mullen and Company. During the following years, Mullen took over the Iron Clad Mill, Sigler Mill, Excelsior Mill and opened the Hungarian Mill in 1882. In 1885, the Colorado Milling and Elevator Company (CM&E;) was formed as a trust to help stabilize unpredictable flour prices; area millers elected Mullen as general manager, thereby increasing Mullen's industry influence. In addition to milling, Mullen was involved in the land and cattle business, including the J.K. Mullen Land and Cattle Company located in Lamar, the Platte Land and Cattle Company in Logan County; and the Riverside Land and Cattle Company in Larimer County. Among his contributions to the Colorado milling industry were his introduction of the Hungarian milling process (alternative to gristmill) and high-altitude flour. Over time, Mullen entered the financial sector, first as president of Union Savings and Loan Association, later a director at the First National Bank of Denver. Personal life Mullen married Catherine Smith on 12 October 1874. They had five daughters. All are buried in the Mullen plot at Mount Olivet Cemetery (Wheat Ridge, Colorado) He became known as a philanthropist because of his numerous donations of land and money. Among his most notable gifts: * Funds for the construction of the J.K. Mullen Memorial Library at The Catholic University of America (in Washington D.C.) and a fund to provide ten annual scholarships for Colorado men to the university * The land and one-quarter million dollars for building the J.K. Mullen Home for the Aged in Denver, presently known as the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged; * Funds for the erection of St. Cajetan's Catholic Church, a large Hispanic parish; * Major donations for the construction of the Immaculate Conception Cathedral; * Established the John K. and Catherine S. Mullen Benevolent Corporation in 1924. Honors In recognition of Mullen's efforts on behalf of the Catholic Church, the Pope twice knighted him, first as a Knight of the Order of St Gregory and later as a Knight of the Order of Malta. Death Mullen died of pneumonia on 9 August 1929, aged 82, with an estimated net worth of $4 million. He was the first person to lie in state at Denver's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. After Mullen's death, his daughters established in- state the Mullen Home for Boys in his memory.

Volume One: Kingdom Animalia. 584 pp General description The generally slender, bluish-white to milk-white, semitranslucent shell is more or less elongated and has a cylindro-conic shape. The apex is sinistral. The reversed, flattened or projecting protoconch consists of 1¬Ω to 3 whorls that are oblique or tilted from transverse to the axis. The teleoconch contains many planulate or more or less convex whorls. These are sometimes shouldered and are generally ornamented with less prominent longitudinal ribs ( = costulate). The intercostal spaces are smooth or crossed bv more or less distinct, incised, sometimes raised, spiral lines. The spiral lines often also appear on the base of the shell, which varies from short, little rounded (the body whorl is subangulated at the periphery), to elongate and well-rounded. The shape of the aperture varies from subquadrate with a straight columellar lip, to an elongate-ovate shape, well-rounded and produced below, with a curved columellar lip. The peritreme is generally discontinuous, rarely continuous. The outer lip is always thin and entire. The inner lip is more or less thickened and reflected, often with a plication or fold that is not always visible externally. The columella is vertical, not plicate. The columellar fold is single, varying in strength. The horny operculum is subspiral. The shell is usually smaller than in Pyramidella and larger than in Odostomia. The animal has wide tentacles, an elongated, flattened mentum, usually bilobed in front. The foot is large and anteriorly auriculated.Dall & Bartsch, A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, p. 19: 1909G.W.

It is an actively developed fork of the 2004 game Glest, which is no longer under development. In-game screenshot Gameplay MegaGlest is set in a fantasy world with seven factions: Magic, Tech, Indians, Egypt, Norsemen, Persian and Romans, which together form the Megapack. Each come with their own set of units, buildings and upgrades, advantages and disadvantages, which allows for variation in strategy while keeping a balanced gameplay. For example, the Tech faction uses traditional human warriors and has medieval mechanical devices in its arsenal, and are strong in melee combat while the Magic faction is designed for more advanced players with most of their units morphed from or summoned by others. Magic lacks the hand-to-hand combat strength of the Tech faction but features more versatile units. Tilesets are selected at the new game setup menu and determine the graphical nature of the MegaGlest game world. MegaGlest provides cross-platform online multiplayer LAN/Internet support. Because of the modability of the engine, MegaGlest can play games from a variety of player-created mods and total conversions, spanning very different themes. The Japanese mod is an artistic mod with units and buildings inspired by historic Japanese warfare. Prax is another fantasy- themed tech tree which bears some similarities to MegaGlest's Magic and Tech factions but improves upon them, bearing both units and structures with very different properties and making use of newer engine features. The Military Glest and Enemies and Allies mods have a contemporary warfare theme and the Vbros Mods have a variety of factions; British, Western, Pirates, Canadians, Crusaders, Dark Knights, USA, Moon, Chess, Penguins, and much more. Game engine While the term MegaGlest is usually used to refer to the complete game, the game engine, referred to as MegaGlest Engine, may also be used to create separate games. At this time, there is one released game which is built on the MegaGlest Engine: Annex - Conquer the World, another free and open source real-time strategy game, has a futuristic scenery with Manga elements, vehicle and hero units, and is therefore quite different from MegaGlest. Two more games are under development, planning to combine the open source engine with proprietary assets. Development MegaGlest, a cross-platform game, is a continuation of real-time classic Glest, which has not been developed since April 2009. The MegaGlest game intends to continue in Glest's spirit and with similar gameplay, while improving existing features and adding more functionality, and therefore continues to use the Glest versioning scheme. The MegaGlest engine is designed to be moddable, with game elements defined by editable XML files. While a map editor and a model viewer are included, additional game assets can also be developed using separate open source applications (such as Blender) and are stored in open and documented formats (PNG, JPEG, Ogg) and the software's own G3D Glest model file format. MegaGlest focuses on stable releases which provide reliable cross platform multi-player games while implementing new features and delivering new game content. The engine is continuously improved but this is of secondary exiguity after stability. Another Glest fork, GAE, was primarily oriented towards extending the game engine and providing more options for full conversions, and was more experimental in nature. In 2011 it was suggested that the two forks should merge, but due to different philosophies and goals amongst the developers of both forks this effort was called off during the planning stage.

Description  This orchid is a rhizomatous monocot, perennial herb growing to a maximum height around . There are 3 to 7 oval or lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately on the stem, each up to long by wide. The herbage is hairy and sticky. The inflorescence at the top of the stem contains one or two flowers. The flower has a dorsal sepal covering the petals and two lateral sepals. There are three petals: two flat white petals on either side and one central petal modified into a white or pink-tinged pouch with purplish spotting at the lip and inside, which is said to resemble a sparrow's egg. The fruit is a capsule. The plant may reproduce by seed but it more often reproduces vegetatively by sending up more stems from the rhizome.  Habitat  This species grows farther north than other Cypripedium. It grows in moist spruce forests at low elevations, tundra, dunes, and river terraces, lakeshores, and streambanks. It often grows on calcareous substrates. It is associated with plants such as white spruce (Picea glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii), western redcedar (Thuja occidentalis), red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea), willows (Salix spp.), horsetail (Equisetum spp.), longtube twinflower (Linnaea borealis), sedges (Carex spp.), one-sided pyrola (Orthilia secunda), and moss carpet (Pleurozium schreberi).  Range  Cypripedium passerinum is native to northern North America. It is widespread in Canada from British Columbia to Quebec, as well as all three northern territories. It also is found Alaska and in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, including inside Glacier National Park.  Importance to the Ecosystem  Little is known about the importance of C. passerinum to the ecosystem. In some studies, it has been noted that insects (e.g., moths, sawfly, and a leaf miner) have fed on them. Bees have been identified to pollinate other Cypripedium however unlike other Cypripedium, C. passerinum is self pollinating and therefore does not require a pollinator for reproduction. A variety of species grow with the Sparrow's Egg Lady Slipper, such as Linnaea borealis, Carex concinna, Orthilia secunda, and Pleurozium schreberi  Conservation  Cypripedium passerinum is an extremely rare plant and is at risk of becoming extinct. Its highly specific habitat requirements contribute to its risk of extinction. In the United States, C. passerinum is only found in two states, Alaska and Montana, and in locations that are threatened by oil and gas exploration.

The story is based on the legendary Generals of the Yang Family. The film was selected as part of the 2013 Hong Kong International Film Festival. Plot The film is set in the early Northern Song dynasty, AD 986, of northeastern China. Former Northern Han general and the patriarch of the Yang clan Yang Ye pledges allegiance to the new Han Chinese-ruled Song regime after Northern Han's fall. Years later Yang's seventh son, Yang Yansi, participated in a martial arts tournament with his father's rival Pan Renmei's son Pan Bao in his sixth brother Yang Yanzhao's place to win Later Zhou's former princess Chai Meirong's (who is Yang Yanzhao's childhood sweetheart) hand in marriage, which ended in the latter's death. The following morning Yang and Pan meet with the emperor about the issue; Yang executes 30 whiplashes to his young sons as punishment. Later, Song's border stations are burned, signaling an invasion from the Khitan-ruled Liao regime. The Khitan army hopes to take its revenge on the Yang Clan and their followers for a past defeat that killed a Khitan general ten years previously. It was noted that the leader of the invading Khitan army is Yel√º Yuan, son of the deceased Khitan general. Due to politics and Pan Bao's death, Pan Renmei is awarded with 50,000 troops to repel the Khitan army. As punishment, Gen. Yang is given a lesser task‚Äîto lead the charge and be the scout. When the two armies meet, Pan Renmei's lack of experience and inept leadership causes chaos among the Song army, and the Khitan forces emerge with a decisive victory. All the while Gen. Yang is trapped behind enemy lines in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain. The Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave. Pan, however, refuses to send troops to rescue Yang as revenge. This leaves Yang Ye's wife, She Saihua, devastated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him. It is later revealed that this is exactly what Yel√º Yuan wanted, and the sons fall into his deadly trap. Led by the eldest son, Yang Yanping, the seven brothers‚Äîincluding the two youngest, who unlike their brothers have never seen combat‚Äîset out with a small band of Yang Clan's elite soldiers to fight through an army of thousands to reach to the Wolf Mountain. When they finally arrive in the town, the Khitan army starts bombarding it with catapults and unleashes a fierce attack. The seven escape with their father, but are the only ones of the clan to survive; all the soldiers with them are killed. In the escape the father is wounded with a poisoned arrow. and he ultimately kills himself. The sons decide to bring their father's body home for a proper burial and to allow their mother to see her beloved husband one last time. Before sending off the seven sons, She Saihua visits a fortune teller, who gives her a slip of paper saying: \\"Seven will set off, six will return\\". By the end of the film, Yang Yansi dies after Pan's archers fill him full of arrows under his orders after he escaped from Wolf Mountain, and Yel√º Yuan personally hunts Yang Ye's surviving sons and kills five of them. However, Yang Yanzhao alone defeats and kills Yel√º in combat, seemingly proving the prediction wrong. It turns out, though, that the message was correct; what it actually meant was that Yang Yanzhao, who was son #6, was the one who would return and have a greater destiny than his siblings. He returned with his father's body, the brothers' weapons and Yel√º Yuan's severed head. Although four of Yang Ye's sons' bodies were recovered, two had never been found. After his father's and brothers' funerals, Yang Yanzhao marries Chai Meirong. His victory over Yel√º Yuan redeemed his father's failure to stop the Khitan army, and the Khitan empress had to halt her assault on the Song empire due to the loss of her general. Because of the sons' courageous actions, Yang Yanzhao rises to his late father's position as general and the Yang Clan developed a legendary reputation in China. Cast *Adam Cheng as Yang Ye - Gen.

In July 2019, the product was purchased by HCL Technologies. AppScan is intended to test Web applications for security vulnerabilities during the development process, when it is least expensive to fix such problems. The product learns the behavior of each application, whether an off-the-shelf application or internally developed, and develops a program intended to test all of its functions for both common and application-specific vulnerabilities. History AppScan was originally developed by Israeli software company Sanctum Ltd. (which was initially named Perfecto Technologies) and was first released in 1998. In 1999 Sanctum expanded its web security offering and launched one of the world's first Application firewall, named AppShield. The first version of AppScan was developed by a team led by Gili Raanan, and was running on a dedicated Linux server. AppScan version 2 was released in February 2001, adding policy recognition engine and knowledge database, an automatic and customizable crawler engine and attack simulator. Version 3 was released in April 2002, adding collaborative testing capabilities, where different tasks can be assigned to different testers; and a number of user interface enhancements in both the scanning and reporting sections of the program. By 2003 AppScan was used by over 500 enterprise customers and revenues reached $30m. In July 2004, Sanctum was acquired by Massachusetts based company Watchfire, which developed a web applications management platform named WebXM. AppScan became Watchfire's flagship product and Sanctum's R&D; center in Herzliya, Israel, became Watchfire's main R&D; location. In June 2007, Watchfire was acquired by IBM and incorporated into the Rational Software product line, enabling IBM to cover more of the application development lifecycle; with an addition of a tool to help developers make security intrinsic to the application. Watchfire R&D; center was incorporated into IBM R&D; Labs in Israel. In 2009 IBM acquired Ounce Labs, adding to the AppScan line a tool that finds and corrects vulnerabilities in software source code during the development process, which was renamed AppScan Source Edition. In June 2019, HCL acquired select IBM collaboration, commerce, digital experience, AppScan and BigFix solutions.HCL Technologies to acquire select IBM software productsHCL Technologies to Acquire Select IBM Software Products for $1.8B Editions * AppScan Enterprise Edition - Client-server version used to scale security testing. * AppScan Standard Edition - Desktop software for automated Web application security testing environment for IT Security, auditors, and penetration testers * AppScan Source Edition - Prevent data breaches by locating security flaws in the source code * AppScan on Cloud - Application Security Testing suite as a service.

The nuclear whorls are moderately large, obliquely deeply immersed in the first post- nuclear whorl, the peripheral portion only of the last volution projects above the edge. The four post-nuclear whorls are moderately rounded, and the shoulders are strongly crenelated. They are marked between the sutures by four spiral keels. The posterior two of these keels are a little more closely spaced than the rest. They are also marked by twenty axial ribs which do not extend entirely across the whorl but terminate at the sulcus which separates the third from the fourth keel. Each junction of an axial rib and a spiral keel is marked by a tubercle The tubercles of the first and second keel belonging to the same axial rib are somewhat fused, there being a less prominent constriction between them than between the second and third. The complete effect is that of an exclamation point. The fourth spiral keel is strong and rounded and decidedly elevated, a very slender extension of the axial rib reaches across the deep spiral sulcus, which like the sulci of the base is crossed by fine, subequally spaced, raised axial threads. The base of the shell is moderately well rounded, attenuated, and ornamented with five subequal and subequally spaced, somewhat flattened, spiral keels. The suboval aperture is rather large, and effuse at the junction of the outer lip and the columella. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is wavy, thin, and shows the external sculpture within. The columella is strong, curved, re- enforced by the attenuated base and provided with a strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.Dall & Bartsch, Notes on Japanese, Indo-Pacific and American Pyramidellidae; Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, vol XXX n¬∞ 1452; 1906 Distribution This species occurs in the following locations: * Pacific Ocean : off Japan * Northwest Atlantic (not valid - see remarks) Notes Additional information regarding this species: * Distribution: Massachusetts to North Carolina * Taxonomic Remark: The name Odostomia dux (type locality: Japan) has been applied to an American Atlantic species on the grounds that the type locality of Japan was incorrect.

The spaces enclosed by the ribs and cords are rectangular pits, which have their long axis parallel with the spiral cords. The sutures are channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a spiral groove. The base of the body whorl is well rounded, and marked by eight spiral cords which grow successively weaker and closer spaced from the periphery to the umbilical area. The wide grooves between the spiral cords are marked by slender, raised, axial threads, which correspond to the ribs on the spire. The aperture is ovate and somewhat effuse anteriorly.

The nuclear whorls are decollated. The six post- nuclear whorls are well rounded, appressed at the summit. They are marked by four equally strong but not equally spaced, incised, spiral lines between the sutures. The fourth of these is immediately above the periphery, while the first is as far below the summit as the third is posterior to the fourth. The second line divides the space between the first and third into equal halves, which are about one and a half times as wide as the spaces included between the third and fourth incised spiral. In addition to the spiral sculpture the whorls are crossed by numerous, fine, decidedly retractive, incremental lines. The periphery of the body whorl is somewhat inflated, well rounded. The base of the shell is moderately long and moderately rounded, crossed by 8 strongly incised, equal, spiral lines, which are a little stronger than those occurring on the spire. These lines become exceedingly closely spaced between the periphery and the umbilical area. The axial sculpture on the base is of the same character and strength as that appearing on the spire. All of the incised, spiral lines on base and spire are crossed by very slender, axial threads, which lend these channels a somewhat pitted appearance. The sutures are well impressed. The aperture is moderately large, oval, and effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip oblique, moderately long, somewhat reflected, and re-enforced for the greater part of its length by the attenuated base, provided with an oblique fold at its insertion.

The nuclear whorls are quite large, forming a moderately elevated, helicoid spire, whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is about one-fourth immersed. The five post-nuclear whorls are decidedly rounded, with the greatest convexity falling on the anterior third of the whorls, between the sutures, appressed at the summit. They are marked by decidedly sinuous, slender, axial ribs, of which about 18 occur upon the first and second, 20 upon the third, and 28 upon the penultimate turn. The intercostal spaces are about three times as wide as the ribs. In addition to the axial sculpture, the whorls are crossed by three equal and subequally spaced, spiral threads, which are almost as strong as the axial ribs. The first of these is situated at the posterior termination of the anterior third, between the sutures, while the third marks the periphery, the second being halfway between the two. The intersections of the spiral threads and axial ribs are lightly nodulose, while the spaces enclosed between them appear as almost square pits. The base of the shell is well rounded, marked by four slender, spiral threads and the feeble continuations of the axial ribs, which extend to the umbilical area. The sutures are strongly impressed. The aperture is ear-shaped. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is slightly curved, decidedly revolute, adnate to the base, provided with a strong, obliquo fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thick callus, which connects the insertion of the inner lip with the posterior angle of the aperture.Paul Bartsch, Additions to the West American Pyramidellid Mollusk Fauna, with Descriptions of New Species, Proceedings of the United States National Museum 42; pages 23; 1903 Distribution This species occurs in the Gulf of California.

It is yellowish-white, the exterior surface marked by irregular tumescences, giving it a much worn appearance. The three whorls of the protoconch are deeply immersed, having their axis at about a right angle to the axis of the succeeding turns. The six whorls of the teleoconch are moderately well rounded and faintly shouldered at the summit. The sutures are simple and well marked. The periphery and the base of the body whorl is well rounded, the latter somewhat elongated. The umbilicus is faint. The pyriform aperture is quite large. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is moderately thick. The columella is very oblique, fairly strong, revolute, with a strong fold somewhat anterior to its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a fairly strong callus.

The eight whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, marked by four strong, equal, and almost equally spaced spiral cords which are separated by three well-incised spiral grooves. The suture is subchanneled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a depressed cord which is not quite as strong as those between the sutures. The base of the shell is somewhat attenuated, well rounded.

Description The bluish-white shell has an elongate-ovate shape. Its length measures 3.2 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, only two- thirds of the last volution projects above them. The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded and somewhat inflated. They are marked by numerous incremental lines and five equally strong, but irregularly distributed, punctate, incised, spiral lines between the sutures. The two near the summit are placed closer to each other than any of the others, the space between the summits and the second line being about equal to the space enclosed between the first and second supra-peripheral lines. The third line falls on about the middle of the exposed portion of the whorls and is a little nearer to the second line than the one anterior to it. In addition to these five strongly incised lines there are numerous very fine and closely spaced spiral strife which cross all parts of the surface of the shell. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are inflated, the latter marked by lines of growth and eight strongly incised, punctate spiral lines, which are a little less strongly impressed and a little more closely spaced at the umbilical area than at the peripheral part of the base. These lines equal those of the spire in strength. The sutures are constricted. The aperture is very large, somewhat effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is curved, reinforced by the attenuated base and provided with a strong fold at its insertion.

The six whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, slightly contracted at the sutures, feebly shouldered at the summits. They are marked between the sutures by four broad low spiral bands which are separated by narrow, deeply incised lines. In addition to these bands, the first three and one-half whorls are marked by feeble axial ribs which are best developed near the summit of the whorls and scarcely reach the suture. The junction of the ribs and the cords form weak nodules. The sutures are strongly impressed but not channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded, marked by a low spiral cord.

The nuclear whorls number at least 2, forming a depressed helicoid spire, which is obliquely, almost one- half immersed in the first of the succeeding turns. The six post-nuclear whorls are moderately rounded. They are marked by strong, decidedly retractive, axial ribs and, on the first four turns, by three spiral cords which equal the ribs in strength; the middle one of these three cords is a little nearer that at the summit than to the one anterior to it. Of the ribs, 16 occur upon all the whorls. The intersections of the ribs and spiral cords form strong, compressed tubercles, the long axes of which coincide with the spiral sculpture. The spaces between the cords and ribs are well rounded, strongly impressed pits. The median cord on the first four whorls is a little stronger than the other two. On the penultimate whorl a slender, spiral cord makes its appearance, between the median and the supraperipheral cord, which on the last turn, immediately behind the aperture, attains a strength equal to that of the spiral cord at the summit. The entire surface of the spire is marked by numerous, very fine, incremental lines. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a deep channel across which the axial ribs extend feebly. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by four strong spiral keels, which are subequally spaced and grow somewhat weaker successively from the peripheral to the umbilical area. Immediately anterior to the last of these spiral keels there is a single, slender, raised spiral thread. The spaces between the spiral keels are crossed by slender continuations of the axial ribs and very fine lines of growth. The aperture is oval. The inner lip is oblique, strong, slightly reflected upon and adnate to the base. It is provided with a moderately strong fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.Proceedings of the United States National Museum 42:286 Odostomia (Chrysallida) heterocincta Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California.

Its length measures 2.8 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The five whorls of the teleoconch are moderately contracted at the sutures, strongly slopingly shouldered at the summit, where the angle of the shoulder falls on the second spiral keel. The whorls are marked by well developed, nodulous axial ribs, of which 20 occur upon all the whorls. The intercostal spaces are about twice as wide as the ribs, crossed by five equal spiral cords, which are about half as strong as the ribs and render them nodulous at their junction. The first spiral cord is a little posterior to the middle of the shoulder. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and cords are deep, rectangular pits, the long axis of which coincides with the spiral cords. The sutures are strongly marked, but not channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a spiral cord to the posterior extremity of which the axial ribs extend, but whose summits they do not cross. The base of the shell is short, well rounded. It is marked by nine spiral keels which are about as wide as the spaces that separate them, decreasing successively in strength and spacing from the periphery to the umbilical area. The grooves between the spiral cords are marked by numerous fine, axial raised threads. The aperture is oval, slightly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin.

Sea shells of Tropical West America. Marine mollusks from Baja California to Per√∫. (2nd edit.). Stanford University Press pp. 1064: Description The shell is very small, pupiform, vitreous. The whorls of the protoconch are smooth, deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only a portion of the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The early whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, later ones flattened, somewhat excurved at the shouldered and beaded summit, and slightly contracted at the sutures. The whorls are marked by strong rounded, tuberculated axial ribs, which are decidedly protractive on all but the last whorl; on this they are only moderately protracted. Of the axial ribs, 14 appear upon the first, 16 upon the second, 20 upon the third, and 24 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the ribs the whorls are marked between the sutures by four spiral cords, which almost equal the ribs in strength, forming tubercles at their junctions with the axial ribs. On the last whorl and one- half the summit drops below the peripheral keel and leaves this in the suture. The axial ribs, however, terminate at the posterior edge of it, and thus leave it without tubercles. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and cords appear as deep oval pits having their long axis parallel to the cords. Sutures are well marked but not channeled. The base of the body whorl is long, well rounded, and strongly inflated. It is marked by seven spiral cords, the four anterior to the periphery being equal and equally spaced, the other three growing successively smaller. The channels between the cords are very regular, marked by many slender axial riblets. The oval aperture is somewhat effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is obtuse.

Life Bromberg was born in Centerville, Iowa to David Bromberg, an immigrant from Germany, and Tonata Sobul, an immigrant from Poland.Iowa, Delayed Birth Records, 1856-1940 At the age of 16, Bromberg was chosen the winner of the prestigious George Bellows Award, a national art competition among high school students. First prize was a year's scholarship to the Pratt Institute in New York City, but he opted instead to accept a full scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art. He studied at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, with Boardman Robinson and Henry Varnum Poor, from 1932 to 1940. Bromberg completed three murals for the New Deal's Section of Fine Arts: Greybull, Wyoming, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and Geneva, Illinois. Bromberg married Jane Dow in Woodstock, New York, in December 1941. Technical Sgt. Manuel Bromberg, World War IIIn 1943, at the age of 26, Bromberg was appointed by George Biddle, Chairman of the War Department Art Advisory Board, as an official war artist. Bromberg was assigned to serve with the European Theater of Operations (England, France and Germany) and landed on Omaha Beach in June 1944. While in France, Bromberg met Pablo Picasso,https://waamblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/bromberg-on-left-with- picasso-in-paris-sutdio-1945.jpg Jean Cocteau, and Georges Braque.

Contingent claims are applied under financial economics in developing models and theory, and in corporate finance as a valuation framework.

This contingent claim valuation, uses option pricing models to measure the value of assets that share option-like characteristics. While these models were initially used to value traded options, there has been an attempt in recent years to extend the reach of these models into more traditional valuation. The fundamental premise here, is that ‚Äúdiscounted cash flow models tend to understate the value of assets that provide payoffs that are contingent on the occurrence of an event.\\" See Real options valuation generally, and #Applicability of standard techniques. (One major modification here is that these models often rely on a replicating portfolio as opposed to traditional risk neutral pricing.) Typical corporate finance \\"project\\" valuations would include patents, undeveloped natural resource reserves, and contingent value rights ‚Äì all of these exhibiting optionality.

Retrieved November 11, 2011 The FBW, overseen by the Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts, renders an expert opinion on films. Its two certification marks for outstanding quality are \\"worthwhile\\" (Wertvoll) and \\"especially worthwhile\\" (Besonders wertvoll). In case of winning a mark, screenwriters, directors and other film artists receive so- called reference points; these make it easier for filmmakers to receive subsidies for future projects. Likewise, films rated as \\"worthwhile\\" or \\"especially worthwile\\" are subject to lower entertainment taxes, depending on the specific state laws. Films are rated separately by genre. For example, the same jury rated two films ‚Äì Hellboy II: The Golden Army and Das wei√üe Band ‚Äì in the same meeting, and awarded them both an especially worthwhile. The first film to be reviewed and decorated by this institution was Peter Lorre's directorial debut, Der Verlorene. In 1988, the FBW was heavily criticized for awarding a worthwhile rating to Rambo III. The FBW and the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (Voluntary Self Regulation of the Movie Industry, also known as FSK), also based in Wiesbaden, work independently from each other. The FSK (similar to the British Board of Film Classification) manages a motion picture rating system with regard to the eligibility of films for children, and concentrates on how old viewers must be before they might be allowed to consume the examined media without the company of an adult. While the FSK has a remit to examine all media before they can be sold in Germany, the FBW audits all films that can be legally distributed in Germany. Films are audited on request, for a fee of about 20 Euros per minute. The 85 judges who adjudicate films in teams of five are paid on a nominal basis at 20 Euros per day, plus expenses. Because the FBW's ratings are valuable in marketing films and DVDs, most commercial productions are audited by the FBW ‚Äì even though any student filmmaker can have his or her short film rated by the FBW, too.

They have a glycosyl head group, in this case a rhamnose moiety, and a 3-(hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid (HAA) fatty acid tail, such as 3-hydroxydecanoic acid. Specifically there are two main classes of rhamnolipids: mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids, which consist of one or two rhamnose groups respectively. Rhamnolipids are also heterogeneous in the length and degree of branching of the HAA moiety, which varies with the growth media used and the environmental conditions. Rhamnolipids biosynthesis The first genes discovered in a mutagenesis screen for mutants unable to produce rhamnolipids were rhlA and rhlB. They are arranged in an operon, adjacent to rhlRI, a master regulator of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proteins encoded by rhlA and rhlB; RhlA and RhlB respectively, are expected to form a complex because of the operonic nature of the genes which encode these two proteins and because both proteins are necessary for production of rhamnolipids. Furthermore, it was supposed that the role of RhlA was to stabilise RhlB in the cell membrane and thus the RhlAB complex was labelled as the enzyme Rhamnosyltransferase 1 and is frequently cited as such although there is no biochemical evidence for this and RhlA has been shown to be monomeric in solution. RhlA was subsequently shown to be involved in the production of the precursor to RHLs, HAAs. RhlB adds a rhamnose group to the HAA precursor to form mono-rhamnolipid. Therefore, the products of the rhlAB operon; RhlA and RhlB, catalyse the formation of HAAs and mono-rhamnolipids respectively. RhlA is an Œ±, Œ≤ hydrolase (analysis by Fugue structural prediction programme). This fold is a common structural motif in fatty acid synthetic proteins and RhlA shows homology to transacylases. It has been shown using enzyme assays that the substrate for RhlA is hydroxyacyl-ACP rather than hydroxyacyl-CoA suggesting that it catalyses the formation of HAAs directly from the type II fatty acid synthase pathway (FASII). Furthermore, RhlA preferentially interacts with hydroxyacyl-ACP with an acyl chain length of ten carbon residues. The hydroxyacyl-ACP substrate of RhlA is the product of FabG, a protein which encodes the NADPH-dependent Œ≤-keto-acyl-ACP reductase required for fatty acid synthesis. It is a member of the FASII cycle along with FabI and FabA, which synthesise the precursors utilised by FabG. Another gene necessary for synthesis of di-rhamnolipids, rhlC, has also been identified. RhlC catalyses the addition of the second rhamnose moiety to mono-rhamnolipids forming di-rhamnolipids, hence is often labelled rhamnosyltransferase 2. Like rhlA and rhlB, rhlC is thought to be an ancestral gene controlled by the same quorum sensing system as rhlA and rhlB. The rhamnose moiety for mono- and di- rhamnolipids is derived from AlgC activity and the RmlABCD pathway, encoded on the rmlBCAD operon. AlgC produces sugar precursors directly for alginate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as rhamnolipids. In rhamnose synthesis, AlgC produces glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which is converted to dTDP-D-glucose by RmlA followed by conversion to dTDP-6-deoxy-D-4-hexulose and then dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose by RmlB and RmlC respectively. Finally, dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose is converted to dTDP-L-rhamnose by RmlD. The rhamnose can then be used in the synthesis of rhamnolipids by RhlB and RhlC. The complete pathway of biosynthesis of rhamnolipids has not been confirmed. In summary, mono- and di- rhamnolipids are produced by sequential rhamnosyltransferase reactions catalysed by RhlB and RhlC respectively. The substrate for RhlB is the fatty acid moiety of the detergent, produced by RhlA. The role of rhamnolipids for the producing cell The reason that Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces rhamnolipids is the subject of much speculation. They have been shown to have several properties, and investigations in a rhlA mutant that does not make HAAs nor rhamnolipids have attributed many functions to rhamnolipids which may in fact be due to HAAs. These functions fall broadly into five categories, described below. =Uptake of hydrophobic substrates= As mentioned previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to metabolise a variety of substrates including n-alkanes, hexadecane and oils. Uptake of these hydrophobic substrates is speculated to rely on the production of rhamnolipids. It is thought that rhamnolipids either cause the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface to become hydrophobic, promoting an interaction between the substrate and the cell, or secreted rhamnolipids emulsify the substrate and allow it to be taken up by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell. There is evidence that rhamnolipids are highly adsorbent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface, causing it to become hydrophobic. It has also been shown that production of rhamnolipids promotes uptake of hexadecane by overcoming the inhibitory effect of the hydrophilic interactions caused by LPS. Production of rhamnolipids is observed on hydrophobic substrates but equally high yields are achievable on other carbon sources such as sugars. Furthermore, although mono-rhamnolipids have been shown to interact with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell membrane and cause it to become hydrophobic, di-rhamnolipids do not interact well with the cell membrane because the polar head group is too large to penetrate the LPS layer. Therefore, although Rhamnolipids may play a part in interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with hydrophobic carbon sources, they are likely to have additional functions. =Antimicrobial properties= Rhamnolipids have long been reported to have antimicrobial properties. They have been shown to have activity against a range of bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.5 ¬µg/mL to 32 ¬µg/mL. Activity against several fungi such as Fusarium solani and Penicillium funiculosum have also been observed with MICs of 75 ¬µg/mL and 16 ¬µg/mL respectively. Rhamnolipids have been suggested as antimicrobials able to remove Bordetella bronchiseptica biofilms. The mode of killing has been shown to result from intercalation of rhamnolipids into the cell membrane causing pores to form which result in cell lysis, at least in the case of Bacillus subtilis. The anti-microbial action of rhamnolipids may provide a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by excluding other microorganisms from the colonised niche. Furthermore, rhamnolipids have been shown to have anti-viral and zoosporicidal activities. The antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids may confer a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in niche colonisation as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a soil bacterium, as well as competing with other bacteria in the cystic fibrosis lung. =Virulence= As mentioned previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a host of virulence factors in concert, under the control of the quorum sensing system. Many studies show that inhibiting quorum sensing down-regulates the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it has been shown that rhamnolipids specifically are a key virulence determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A variety of virulence factors were analysed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from pneumonia patients. Rhamnolipids were found to be the only virulence factor that was associated with the deterioration of the patients to ventilator-associated pneumonia. Several other reports also support the role of rhamnolipids in lung infections. The effect of rhamnolipids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence has been further noted in corneal infections (Alarcon et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2004). It has been shown that rhamnolipids are able to integrate into the epithelial cell membrane and disrupt tight-junctions. This study used reconstituted epithelial membranes and purified rhamnolipids to demonstrate this mechanism. In addition to inhibition and killing of epithelial cells, rhamnolipids are able to kill polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and macrophages and inhibit phagocytosis. In summary, rhamnolipids have been shown unequivocally to be a potent virulence factor in the human host, however, they are also produced outside of the host, for example in a soil environment. Rhamnolipids contribute to the establishment and maintenance of infection in cystic fibrosis patients in a number of ways, they disrupt the bronchial epithelium by disrupting the cell membranes, which promotes paracellular invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and causes ciliostasis, further preventing the clearing of mucus. They also solubilise lung surfactant, allowing phospholipase C access to cell membranes and are necessary for correct biofilm formation. =Biofilm mode of growth= There are three main phases of biofilm development and rhamnolipids are implicated in each phase. Rhamnolipids are reported to promote motility, thereby inhibiting attachment by preventing cells from adhering tightly to the substratum. During biofilm development, rhamnolipids are reported to create and maintain fluid channels for water and oxygen flow around the base of the biofilm. Furthermore, they are important for forming structure in biofilms; a rhlA mutant forms a flat biofilm. Biofilm dispersal is dependent on Rhammnolipids, however other factors such as degradation of the matrix and activation of motility are also likely to be necessary. It has been shown using fluorescence microscopy that the rhlAB operon is induced in the centre of the mushroom cap, followed by dispersal of cells from the polysaccharide matrix from the centre of these caps causing a cavity to form. A mutation in rhlA causes a failure in formation of mushroom caps at all. =Motility= Motility is a key virulence determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has three distinct methods of moving across or through a medium. Rhamnolipids are particularly important in swarming motility where they are postulated to lower the surface tension of the surface through their surfactant properties, allowing the bacterial cell to swarm. New evidence suggests that rhamnolipids are necessary to allow Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells to overcome attachment mediated by type IV pili. There is some discrepancy between the role of HAAs and RHLs in swarming motility. Some studies use a rhlA mutation to assess the effect on motility, which prevents the formation of HAAs and rhamnolipids. Studies that use a rhlB mutant show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can swarm in the absence of rhamnolipids, but HAAs are absolutely necessary for swarming. Rhamnolipids have been proposed to be important in regulating swarm tendril formation. Rhamnolipids and HAAs are also implicated in twitching motility, similarly the surfactant is thought to lower the surface tension allowing cells to move across the substratum. However, the role of rhamnolipids in twitching motility may be nutritionally conditional. Commercial potential of rhamnolipids Surfactants are in demand for a wide range of industrial applications as they increase solubility, foaming capacity and lower surface tensions. In particular, rhamnolipids have been used broadly in the cosmetic industry for products such as moisturisers, condom lubricant and shampoo. Rhamnolipids are efficacious in bioremediation of organic and heavy metal polluted sites. They also facilitate degradation of waste hydrocarbons such as crude oil and vegetable oil by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rhamnolipid surfactant itself is valuable in the cosmetic industry, and rhamnolipids are a source of rhamnose, which is an expensive sugar in itself. Other bio-based surfactants include sophorolipids and mannose-erythritol lipids.

It was allied with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City, San Francisco Bay Area Occupy groups such as Occupy Oakland, Occupy Berkeley, and Occupy San Francisco, and other public California universities. \\"Cal\\" in the name \\"Occupy Cal\\" is the nickname of the Berkeley campus and generally refers specifically to UC Berkeley. A major theme of the Occupy Cal demonstrations is the role of education in creating jobs and improving quality of life for society as a whole. Tuition increases for students, mandatory furloughs for professors and staff, firings or forced realignment of lower-ranking workers as part of the \\"Operational Excellence\\" reorganization, and raises for the highest paid administrators have further fueled discontent. Occupy Cal continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions through March 2012. Background Budget cuts, tuition increases, and unpaid furlough days affecting public California universities have been the target of protest by UC Berkeley students, faculty, and employees in recent years. The UC Regents has approved increased tuition fees nine times in seven years. In September 2009, several thousand students, faculty, and employees converged on Sproul Plaza to protest a proposed tuition increase of 32%. Simultaneous protests on University of California and California State University campuses occurred throughout the state. The statewide campus protests did not sway the UC Regents, however, and the 32% tuition increase was approved in November 2009, setting off another round of protests that included the temporary occupation of campus buildings. Protests continued through 2010 and 2011 with Occupy Cal being the most recent iteration of a multi-year protest for affordable public education. UC Berkeley has a long history of student activism. Berkeley spearheaded the Free Speech Movement in 1964 and was a leader in the opposition to the Vietnam War throughout the 1960s.http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/60s.html Timeline =November 9 protest and police response= On November 9, 2011, students and professors at UC Berkeley participated in a series of \\"teach- outs\\" around campus, a noon rally and march. Approximately 1,500 demonstrators attended the days' events. The march route included a Bank of America location adjacent to campus. Not long after demonstrators set up seven tents in front of Upper Sproul Plaza in the mid-afternoon, law enforcement officials from UC Berkeley Police, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office and other UC Police officers in riot gear arrived to remove the tents. Protesters linked arms to form a human chain in front of the tents to prevent officers from dismantling the encampment. Police used 36-inch riot batons to \\"jab\\" and push back the protesters and to break the human chain. Video footage of the afternoon confrontation shows police using batons and dragging two protesters by the hair, one of whom was UC Berkeley English professor Celeste Langan. 39 protesters, including Professor Langan, were arrested for charges including \\"resisting and delaying a police officer in the performance of their duties and failure to disperse when given a dispersal order.\\" Robert Hass, a UC Berkeley professor of poetry and former United States Poet Laureate, wrote about the police response in a November 19 New York Times opinion piece entitled \\"Poet-Bashing Police\\": > the deputies in the cordon surged forward and, using their clubs as > battering rams, began to hammer at the bodies of the line of students. It > was stunning to see. They swung hard into their chests and bellies. > Particularly shocking to me ‚Äî it must be a generational reaction ‚Äî was that > they assaulted both the young men and the young women with the same > indiscriminate force. If the students turned away, they pounded their ribs. > If they turned further away to escape, they hit them on their spines. Hass himself was hit in the ribs by a police officer wielding a baton. His wife Brenda Hillman was shoved to the ground by a police officer. =Reactions= UC Berkeley administration and police In response to questions about the officers' use of force, UC Police Captain Margo Bennett stated: Robert Birgeneau, UC Berkeley Chancellor, George Breslauer, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, and Harry Le Grande, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs initially released a \\"Message to the Campus Community\\" in which they stated, \\"It is unfortunate that some protesters chose to obstruct the police by linking arms and forming a human chain to prevent the police from gaining access to the tents. This is not non-violent civil disobedience.\\" The administrators also stated, \\"We regret that, given the instruction to take down tents and prevent encampment, the police were forced to use their batons to enforce the policy. We regret all injuries, to protesters and police, that resulted from this effort. The campus's Police Review Board will ultimately determine whether police used excessive force under the circumstances.\\" Following media criticism and statements of disapproval from the university community and academic departments Chancellor Birgeneau released a further \\"Message regarding events on campus\\" in which he stated, \\"I returned to Berkeley yesterday after a week-long trip to Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai where we successfully advanced some important new partnerships that will benefit our campus... While away, I remained in intermittent contact with Provost George Breslauer and other members of our leadership team and was kept informed, as much as possible, about the Occupy Cal activities on campus. However, it was only yesterday that I was able to look at a number of the videos that were made of the protests on November 9. These videos are very disturbing. The events of last Wednesday are unworthy of us as a university community.\\" Birgeneau also stated, \\"we cannot condone any excessive use of force against any members of our community,\\" and granted amnesty to students involved in the protests. Birgeneau's statement that he could not watch videos available on the internet while in Asia was widely met with cynicism from the university community. Police Review Board (PRB) released a report on May 29, 2012 reflecting on the events of November 9. They make it very clear that this is not something they typically do, but given the circumstances and the request of the chancellor to look into the case, the PRB was forced to investigate. They collected a variety of evidence and conducted interviews of key players to understand the scope of the events. They concluded that not all instances of police conduct were consistent with campus norms, and were disturbed by the inappropriate use of batons against students and faculty. PRB noted that deviations from police conduct standards will happen, no matter how comprehensive training is. They encouraged Berkeley campus police and leaders to review their report so as to better understand the scope of their actions and make future improvements to how they handle protests. BAMN is a newer organization fighting for civil rights 'By Any Means Necessary' and they responded to the PRB review strongly. BAMN wrote an article in which they proposed that the PRB should be boycotted now and in the future because they have a conflict of interest. This is a conflict of interest because they claim that the board is appointed by and answers to Chancellor Birgeneau, which would in turn taint their unbiased review. UC faculty and students The ASUC, UC Berkeley's Student Government, was \\"outraged by the brutal tactics used by the UCPD against students.\\" With support from other student governments including UC Davis, Brown, and Harvard, the ASUC, UC Berkeley's student government, passed a resolution condemning the police brutality against students on the November 9 Day of Action. The ASUC has worked to raise awareness of issues such as police brutality highlighted by the Occupy incident. In a packed auditorium at International House, Berkeley's Academic Senate also considered a resolution, which would have expressed no confidence in Birgeneau and other senior campus administrators, but the resolution failed. While much of the energy of Occupy dissipated during the campus winter vacation, subsequent encampments have been set up as recently as mid-February 2012 outside the International House at the corner of Bancroft and Piedmont. The Department of Integrative Biology stated, \\"We are deeply disturbed by the images of violence against members of the campus community, as well as the justification and defense of these acts that followed\\" The School of Social Welfare issued an open letter to the campus community stating, \\"We are outraged and appalled by the violent silencing of UC Berkeley student voices.\\" 70 faculty of the School of Law condemned the police action and called for \\"a reestablishment of the campus's reputation as a beacon of free speech\\". 2,363 faculty and staff stated \\"We express no confidence in the willingness of the Chancellor, and other leaders of the UC Berkeley administration, to respond appropriately to student protests, to secure student welfare, and to respect freedom of speech and assembly on the Berkeley campus.\\" Other reactions Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich responded to the Occupy Cal movement saying that he believe inequality is bad for everyone. Reich says that Median households are dropping, adjusted for inflation, and is worried about where people are going to get the money to keep the economy going. If there isn't money for the middle class to spend the economy will hurt across the board. =General strike on November 15= Occupy Cal General Assembly at night In response to the actions of police officers and other perceived failings of Chancellor Birgeneau and the UC Regents, the Occupy Cal voted to call for a general strike at UC Berkeley on November 15, 2011. The timing of the strike and protests was intended to coincide with a meeting of the UC Regents the next day, which was then cancelled by UC Regents and administrators from the UC Office of the President, citing \\"credible law enforcement intelligence\\". Many students and faculty did not attend classes and walked out, or incorporated teach-ins, or spent at least part of the day actively protesting. The UC Davis Faculty Association also voted to endorse the November 15 systemwide strike.Davis Faculty Association Endorses Occupy Cal‚Äôs Call for Strike Events included a downtown march past Berkeley High School and Berkeley City College, speeches, and resolutions. A small encampment was set up and allowed to exist for a day before being peacefully dismantled on November 17, with 2 voluntary arrests at 3:30 AM. Approximately 100 to 120 police in riot gear were used to dismantle the tents and make the arrests. Following that, tents were flown over Upper Sproul using balloons, including a banner claiming \\"Our Space\\". On November 18, newspaper reports indicate that UC Davis police officers used pepper spray on protesters sitting peacefully on the ground. On December 11, the last day to-date of the visible presence of Occupy Cal on the Mario Savio steps of Sproul Hall, a UC Berkeley student who took a vow of silence as a means of non-violent protest, was arrested, apparently under Section 5150 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code. UC Berkeley Anthropology Library Occupation 2012 On January 17, 2012 a proposal was brought to the Occupy Cal General Assembly to occupy UC Berkeley's George and Mary Foster Anthropology Library due to a recent decision by administration to reduce the library's hours and service offerings. Part of the overall trend of privatization and divesting of public resources, the university has reduced spending on its libraries by 12 percent since 2012. With mass approval by the General Assembly, members of Occupy Cal decided to lead a study-in of the anthropology library on January 19 to demand the reinstatement of the library's hours and resources. On January 19, 2012, following a noon-time rally by the larger Occupy Cal community, a group of roughly 100 students, faculty, and staff occupied the anthropology library and sent their demands to the administration. The non-violent study-in lasted 3 days and 2 nights, and involved several email exchanges between administration, and students and faculty. Following the cutting of the library hours, on January 19, 2012, Occupy Cal hosted a study-in of the George and Mary Foster Anthropology Library to demand reinstatement of the library's hours and services. On January 21, 2012, the occupiers were notified by the administration that their demands would be met and library hours would be reinstated. On January 21, 2012, the occupiers were notified by the administration that their demands would be met: library hours would be reinstated, and a replacement job would be created to achieve regular access to the library. While many non-tangible successes were achieved by Occupy Cal, the reinstatement of the anthropology library's hours represented a concrete, observable success to protect the accessibility and quality of education at the University of California, Berkeley. = Winning Lawsuit and Resolution = BAMN and twenty-nine protesters sued the UC-Berkeley Chancellor Birgeneau, other administrators, UCPD, and other Alameda County Sheriffs for $15 million for excessive force, false arrests, and violation of First Amendment rights from the November 9 protests. They cited other cases where excessive forced was used on Occupy protestors and instances where camping was allowed to strengthen their case. The lawsuit went on for a number of years and the organization BAMN fought hard to present evidence and legal precedent, showing that police and administrator actions were excessive and aimed at repressing political speech. BAMN encouraged people to attend the final hearing on Sept. 10, 2013, claiming that this was a major part of the movement and without the support of the community, the protests on Nov. 9th were in vain. The outcome of the lawsuit awarded the protesters $15 million for punitive and general damages.

He was inspired to start Gay Cable Network after seeing the effects AIDS had on a friend. The network went on to produce original programming, including coverage of Democratic National Conventions and Republican National Conventions between 1984 and 2000. Andy Humm, then a GCN correspondent, recounted years afterward that Maletta's wearing of a \\"spandex, a black leather jacket, the Gay Network T-shirt and a cowboy hat\\" at a backwoods Mississippi Hardee's while en route to the Republican National Convention caught the attention of other patrons, so much so that the place went \\"deadly silent.

It is located at kilometre 24.3 of Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway. Until 1919, the western part of the station was served by the Royal Prussian Military Railway. Location and infrastructure The station is located in Fontaneplatz to the west of the centre of the village of Rangsdorf. It is at ground level and consists of three platforms for passenger traffic. The entrance building of the former Military Railway is located to the west of the tracks and is now used as a residential building. The entrance building of the former Berlin-Dresden railway is located on the eastern side. A third entrance was built at the southern end during the development of the former Military Railway platform for suburban traffic in 1940. A footbridge connects the platforms and both sides of the station. The military station, which was later developed as a suburban station is listed as part of the Military Railway in the heritage list of Brandenburg. History Heritage-listed station building of the Military Railway The station, along with the Berlin-Dresden line of the Berlin-Dresden Railway Company (Berlin-Dresdener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was opened on 17 June 1875. Four months later, the Royal Prussian Military Railway (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Milit√§r-Eisenbahn), which was built parallel with the Dresden Railway, was opened to Zossen. The military station was available for passenger traffic from 1890 and a separate entrance building was opened for the military station on the western side of the railway tracks ten years later. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forbidden after the end of the First World War from continuing to operate the Military Railway. The approximately 30 kilometre-long track between Berlin and Zossen was dismantled in consequence and passenger trains then ran on the Dresden Railway. The entrance building of the Military Railway continued to be used as a residential building. Deutsche Reichsbahn planned the electrification of the Dresden Railway between Berlin Priesterweg and W√ºnsdorf by 1 October 1940. In fact, electrication was completed only as far as Rangsdorf and this was opened to traffic on 6 October 1940. A second edge was added on the west side of the platform of the military station for the electric services, while steam- powered trains running to W√ºnsdorf stopped on the east side of the platform. At the same time the pedestrian bridge was built between the two sides. The main platform on the Dresden railway was subsequently closed. The war prevented any further electrification. The S-Bahn services operated every 20 minutes and connected with the suburban services to W√ºnsdorf. There were no electric services from April 1945 to 1 October 1945 and in the interim steam trains operated. The second track of the Dresden Railways was dismantled for reparations to the Soviet Union and the earlier operation of mixed traffic on two tracks was replaced by steam-hauled and electric trains running on a single track. In 1952, the second track was rebuilt, but it was subsequently used only by S-Bahn trains. The trains ran at 30-minute intervals to Berlin. With the construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the S-Bahn service to Berlin was disrupted. At first trains ran to Mahlow as an isolated service. On 12 September 1961, this isolated service, however, was discontinued due to lack of carriage storage on the line and converted to steam-hauled operation. The steam trains then used on both tracks and the third rail of the western track was dismantled. The western edge of the suburban platform was no longer used. As suburban services no longer terminated in Rangsdorf, but now ran further north, they changed tracks several times near the suburban platform. The eastern platform in front of the station building was therefore returned to service in 1970. In 1982, the Dresden Railway was electrified with overhead wire. This fact complicates plans to restore S-Bahn services to the station, which have been discussed repeatedly since 1990 without resolution. In the course of the project to develop the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway for speed of up to 200 km/h that began in May 2013, an extensive remodelling of Rangsdorf station was approved by the Federal Railway Authority on 19 March 2013. In the summer of 2013 the station building, the footbridge, the loading platform, the loading dock and the pumping station were demolished. Next to each of the two main through tracks there will be a passing loop with a platform for regional services in each direction and to the north of the platforms there will be passing loops for freight trains. The level crossing south of the station will be replaced by railway bridges over the road and access to the platforms will be via stairs and lifts. The signalling and overhead line equipment will be renewed and the construction of noise barriers on both sides over a length of about one kilometre is also part of the project.

Born in Widnes, Cheshire, Attwood became interested in the stock-market at age 14, trading for the first time at the age of sixteen. After travelling to Arizona regularly to visit his aunts, Attwood moved there and eventually becoming mired in the bubbling rave scene and distributing ecstasy, smuggling up to ¬£4 million. He was arrested in 2002 and was released early in 2007 before being deported back to England. Following his release, Attwood became a public speaker and author, chronicling his experiences in prison. His story was featured worldwide on National Geographic Channel as an episode of Locked Up Abroad called \\"Raving Arizona\\". Random House published his life story as the English Shaun Trilogy.http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/authors/shaun-attwood Since his first book Hard Time was published in 2011, Attwood has authored books on his life and other topics. Early life Shaun Attwood was born in Widnes, Lancashire, on 28 October 1968, to a middle-class household, which he has described as \\"loving\\". After watching several films mentioning stock-markets, Attwood educated himself, with the help of his teacher in economics, on trading stocks by reading the Financial Times at fourteen. When he was sixteen, during the privatization of many public companies by the Thatcher government, Attwood attempted to invest in British Telecommunications. After inquiring with his father, a Labour supporter who disagreed with Thatcher government's actions, Attwood sought money from his grandmother who supported the Conservative party and eventually got ¬£50 which he invested and doubled. He regularly visited his aunts in Arizona where he became interested in living in the United States. Attwood attended Liverpool University, studying Business Studies and graduating in 1990. While attending university, Attwood began using Ecstasy in the Manchester rave scene which helped him with his anxiety. Ecstasy distributor: 1997-2002 As Attwood began to organise larger parties with his money, he started purchasing and eventually distributing large amounts of ecstasy in Los Angeles. This gradually turned into what the Phoenix New Times called an \\"empire‚Äù, with Attwood buying pills from the Netherlands to bypass the traffickers in Los Angeles. His operation became associated with the New Mexican Mafia, which offered protection following a night of partying where Attwood's associates helped a member of the New Mexican Mafia with hiding from the police. His main competitor in the Ecstasy market was Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano, a Mafia mass murderer and former underboss of the Gambino crime family. Gravano attempted to kill Attwood and many of Attwood's associates, which caused him to stop dealing and give up distributing, retreating to his then-girlfriend's apartment and living off money earned during his time distributing. Attwood estimated he smuggled up to ¬£4 million of drugs into Arizona which wasn't exclusive to Ecstasy and also included Xanax and ketamine. Evidence had already been collected against Attwood from his years as an Ecstasy kingpin, and, on 16 May 2002, he was arrested at the apartment. Attwood, who had attempted to cleanse himself of any connections to his previous life as a distributor, was caught after ten witnesses came forward. After serving two years in Maricopa County Jail prior to sentencing, Attwood pleaded guilty for a sentence of nine and a half years, and served the balance of his sentence in the Arizona Department of Corrections. Attwood is banned for life from entering the United States. While imprisoned, Attwood wrote about his experiences in prison. These accounts were posted online on a blog titled \\"Jon's Jail Journal\\" to preserve his anonymity; this began to draw international media attention to the conditions that prevailed under Sheriff Arpaio. While incarcerated Attwood submerged himself in literature, reading over 1,000 books in just under 6 years, including many classics. By studying original texts in psychology and philosophy, he sought to better understand himself and his past behaviour. Post-incarceration life In 2007, Attwood was released and deported to the UK, where he continues to maintain his blog, now under his own name, where he publishes letters and accounts sent to him by other prisoners. Having credited books for being the lifeblood of his rehabilitation, Attwood spoke out in outrage on The Wright Stuff at the ban on sending books to UK prisons introduced by Justice Minister Chris Grayling. Attwood visiting a school Attwood now gives talks to schoolchildren and other groups about the negative consequences of drugs and crime, and advocates against Sheriff Arpaio and his methods. Shaun has given several TEDx Talks on his experiences. The University of Basel, Switzerland hosted his 2017 talk on what facing 200 years in prison taught him about happiness. He has appeared on BBC, Sky News, CNN and TV in over 40 countries worldwide to talk about issues affecting prisoners' rights. After appearing on the True Geordie podcast, Attwood started his own 'True Crime' podcast and has a YouTube channel that reached 500,000 subscribers on 20 July 2020. He answers questions about what prison was like, interviews true-crime guests and retells stories of what happened during his time in prison. Shaun Attwood has conducted several interviews and has written on the case surrounding the underage sex trafficking ring around Jeffrey Epstein, and has interviewed conspiracy theorist David Icke regarding the September 11 attacks and the coronavirus pandemic..

Gilka, personal autobiography 1998 Gilka graduated from Marquette University in 1939 with a degree in journalism. Upon graduation, he published a four-page tabloid sized job description called \\"The Gilka Graphic\\", a chronicle of his experience and qualifications, which he sent to several hundred editors around the country.Milwaukee Sentinel newspaper July 5, 1939, p4 The job market was still at a depression low and he was hired by the Zanesville, Ohio Signal newspaper as a general reporter, sports editor, and photographer. At the Signal, he met and married Janet Andrews Bailey, a reporter at the Zanesville Signal in 1941. Their four children are Greer, Jena, Geoffrey, and Gregory. Janet died in 2004.Bruce Dale, photojournalist Gilka died at the age of 96 in an Arlington, Virginia hospice on June 25, 2013, after his third bout of pneumonia that year. Career World War II interrupted Gilka‚Äôs Zanesville career. He volunteered for the Signal Corps, in which he expected to be a photographer. Instead the Army made him an X-ray technician in the medical corps. He served in both the Pacific and European theaters and rose from private to captain. After his discharge in 1945, Gilka was offered a managing editor‚Äôs job in Zanesville but turned it down to go back to his home town and work as a copy editor and sports writer for the Milwaukee Journal. His continuing interest in photography propelled him to the picture desk, which he took over in 1952. Gilka was invited to join the staff of the National Geographic in 1958 and, after a stint as a picture editor, was named director of photography in 1963. In that role, he was responsible for making the photographic assignments for all the Society‚Äôs books and magazines. He pioneered a summer intern program for university students who sought careers in photojournalism. Scores went through the program. Some became staff members; others are on newspaper staffs scattered around the country. He also nurtured and hired photographers he met as a member of the University of Missouri photojournalism workshop faculty for nearly 50 years. For 17 years he was in charge of the Hearst annual photojournalism contest.Jay Talbot interview w REG, for Syracuse University project Gilka's Gorillas Words of encouragement from Bob Gilka were responsible for the development of dozens of fine photographers. During his years at National Geographic, they became known as \\"Gilka‚Äôs Gorillas\\"‚Äîprobably a result of Jane Goodall, naming one of her research chimps (Gilka) after him. At the Geographic he was a staunch supporter of photographers while they traveled throughout the world. He was always willing to defend expense account items such as \\"Cessna 185 aircraft\\" (the whole plane‚Äînot a rental)Book: Traveling the World for National Geographic, by Tom and Lynn Abercrombie, page 74 or obscure items such as \\"Mouse for rattlesnake, house for mouse, cheese for mouse\\". He had a sense of humor that often perplexed new photographers and visitors. On his office door a sign read \\"Wipe knees before entering\\"‚Äînext to his desk was a confessional kneeling bench. Photojournalist Ted Spiegel said of him, \\"Gilka understood empowerment before it was a buzz word. An assignment from Gilka endowed you with unique opportunities and empowered you to probe with responsibility.\\" While at the Geographic, magazine circulation rose from less than 2 million to over 10 million. He retired from National Geographic in 1985 and served as an adjunct professor of photojournalism at Syracuse University until 1992.

Created and directed by Sebasti√°n Borensztein, it stars Lito Cruz and Leonardo Sbaraglia.  Synopsis  The story is about the relationship established between Martin Mondragon, a young psychologist (Sbaraglia) and the man who seeks to collect a debt left by his grandfather a long time ago. The psychologist's grandfather had signed a pact with the devil, but died without delivering his soul. As set out on the contract, Mondragon's grandfather agrees to offer his (then unborn) grandson's soul as the guarantor of the deal. Jos√© Sagasti (Lito Cruz), Satan's agent, presents himself to Mondragon as the one in charge of collecting the old debt and informing the guarantor of his fate. Being a psychologist, Mondragon thinks to have run into a psychopath and dismisses his threats. But soon after their first meeting, Sagasti starts playing mind games and making Mondragon's life a living hell. Through its eight chapters, this mini-series recounts the struggle of Martin to avoid surrendering his soul to Sagasti, the envoy of the devil. Both characters give life to a confrontation that is waged on the earthly plane, and at the same time the one-upmanship also plays on the psychologies of both men.  Cast  * Lito Cruz ...

A Democrat, Roberts served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He served two terms in the Oregon House of Representatives and most of five terms in the Oregon Senate before resigning due to poor health. Roberts was married three times, including to Barbara Roberts, who was the first woman to serve as Governor of Oregon, and to Betty Roberts, who was the first woman to serve as a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. Early life and career Roberts was born in Boise, Idaho, in 1915 to Walter Scott and Mary Livezey Roberts. He received a bachelor's degree from Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon in 1938. In 1943, he married Mary Louise Charleson. Later that year, he earned a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1946, he was hired as a speech professor at Vanport College (later renamed Portland State University). He earned a doctorate from Stanford University in 1954. Roberts and his wife Mary Louise had two daughters, Mary Wendy Roberts and Leslie Roberts. The couple divorced prior to 1960, the year Frank married Betty Cantrell Rice, then a single mother of four and teacher in Portland. Early political career In 1960, Roberts was elected chairman of the Multnomah County Democratic Party. He ran unsuccessfully for the Oregon State Senate in 1962, but was successful in his second attempt at elective office, winning a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives in 1966. He was re-elected to a second term, but in 1970, redistricting forced him to run in another district and he lost in the Democratic primary. Roberts again unsuccessfully sought election to the Oregon House in 1972, but when an open Senate seat was available in 1974, he was elected to the first of six four-year terms representing District 4 in Portland. At the time of his retirement in 1993, Roberts was the longest- serving Oregon legislator. As a legislator, Roberts served on the Ways and Means Committee. He worked to expand social service programs for the poor, disabled, and elderly, expanding Head Start Programs to more children, and funding more medical care programs, such as prenatal care, to the poor. Later career Roberts and his second wife, Betty Roberts, divorced in 1965. She was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1964, and was later elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1969. In 1974, she ran unsuccessfully for both Governor of Oregon and as a replacement candidate for U.S. Senate. Betty later resigned from the Oregon Senate when she was appointed as a judge on the Oregon Court of Appeals, and later was the first woman to serve on the Oregon Supreme Court. Frank Roberts' daughter, Mary Wendy Roberts, also served in the Oregon House from 1973‚Äì75 and the State Senate from 1975‚Äì79, and served alongside her father and stepmother, Betty, for several years before being elected into statewide office as Commissioner of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries. Frank and Mary Wendy were the first, and to date, only, father-daughter team to serve simultaneously in the Oregon Legislative Assembly. In 1971, Roberts met Barbara Hughey Sanders, a single mother with an autistic son, who was lobbying for the right of disabled students to attend public schools. Roberts sponsored Sanders' bill, and befriended and married her in 1974. Barbara Roberts was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1980, Oregon Secretary of State in 1984 and 1988, and became Oregon's 34th governor in 1990. Later life Roberts had a heart attack in 1984, and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1987. Radiation treatment for his cancer destroyed the nerves in his legs and rendered him unable to walk. In 1993, with his cancer spread to his lungs, Roberts, then the longest-serving member of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, resigned from the Oregon Senate on September 1. He died at Mahonia Hall, Oregon's governor's residence, on October 31.

Watershed The three main watersheds of the southwest United States are the Colorado River Basin, the Great Basin, and the Rio Grande Basin. The Colorado River Basin includes parts of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. The Colorado River is the largest river in the Southwest United States. The Great Basin watershed includes parts of southern California, most of Utah, the northwest half of Nevada, and parts of Oregon and Idaho. The Rio Grande Basin includes most of New Mexico, some of western Texas, and a small portion of Colorado. Almost all of Arizona drains into the Colorado River. Most of New Mexico drains into either the Rio Grande or the Pecos River, its tributary. Other watersheds of New Mexico include the Canadian River in the northeast, the San Juan in the Northwest, and the Gila (tributary of Colorado River) in the southwest. Geography and climate The southwest United States has a very rugged and diverse geography, including the Rocky Mountains in the north, a large amount of rangeland, and deserts to the south. The Southwest United States also receives more sunlight than any other region of the United States, so it is warmer on average. =Arizona= There are two main physiographic regions which Arizona is a part of. North and east Arizona is part of the Colorado Plateau, and the Basin and Range is in southern and western Arizona. The Colorado Plateau is a flat, elevated land of soft sedimentary rock about 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level. Rivers cut deep canyons and gorges into the plateau, the largest of which is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, which is in the northwest corner of Arizona. There are also scattered mountains and mesas throughout the mostly flat plateau. The highest mountains in Arizona are the San Francisco Mountains in the northern part of Arizona. Almost all of Arizona lies in the Colorado River Basin. The largest tributary to the Colorado in Arizona is the Gila, which crosses the southern part of the state and meets the Colorado River at Yuma. The Salt River is the principal river of the Gila. There is usually little or no flow of water at the junction of these rivers because of heavy use upstream. In Arizona, there is little rainfall and low humidity. Annual precipitation varies from 2 to 14 inches throughout most of the state. The mountains of Arizona can receive as much as 30 inches. There are huge fluctuations in temperature between day and night. Temperatures frequently reach 100 ¬∞F in the summer, and they can fall as low as 0 ¬∞F in the winters in the Plateau Region. The Plateau Region is generally cooler than the southern Basin and Range. =Nevada= Nevada has some mountains in the north, but a majority of the state is rangeland and desert, being that most of the state resides within the Great Basin. There are three main geographic regions of Nevada: the Columbia Plateau, the Sierra Nevada, and the Basin and Range. Nevada receives less than 10 inches of rainfall per year, on average. The Columbia Plateau is in the northeast part of Nevada. This land is supported by lava bedrock, and there are many deep rivers and canyons entrenched into the landscape. There is also prairie land near the Idaho border. The Sierra Nevada is the mountain range which cuts across Nevada, running south of Carson City. A popular tourist attraction in the Sierra Nevadas is Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America. Lake Tahoe is very popular in the Southwest for its water sports in the summer, and the surrounding mountains have beautiful slopes which are great for hiking, or skiing in the winter. The majority of Nevada is described as the Basin and Range region. This region lies between over 150 mountain ranges which run north to south through the state. This region is to the east of the Sierra Nevadas. Between all of these mountain ranges are vast grasslands, with scattered buttes and mesas. There are also some alkali flats in the region. =New Mexico= New Mexico is covered by four main regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, the Colorado Plateau, and the Basin and Range. The Rocky Mountains cover north-central New Mexico and consist of southward mountain ranges coming from Colorado. The three main mountain ranges are the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the east and the San Juan and Jemez mountains in the west. Between these western and eastern ranges lies the Rio Grande Valley. The mountains of northern New Mexico stand 10,000 to 13,000 feet tall. The Great Plains are in eastern New Mexico. The northernmost section of this region is hilly and contains some lavacapped mesas and buttes. South of the Canadian River, the land is very flat. This region is referred to as the Llano Estacado, or the Staked Plain. West of the Llano Estacado is the Pecos Valley which stretches about 250 miles along the Pecos River. The Pecos Valley is low in elevation and flat, with some mesas and canyons. The lowest point in the state, Red Bluff Lake on the Pecos River, is 2817 feet above sea level. The Basin and Range region is in southwest New Mexico and a thin stretch goes northeast to Santa Fe. This region consists of barren mountain ranges spaced with dry basins. Most mountain ranges in this region are rounded and relatively low. The basins of this area contain salt flats, sand dunes, and lava flows. Most of New Mexico's main rivers carry little water for most of the year, with varying seasonal flows. Because of the undependable water supply, some rivers in New Mexico have been dammed to provide water for irrigation, power, domestic use, and recreation. New Mexico is very dry in most places except the mountains. The climate is known as a middle-latitude steppe climate. The mountains of New Mexico receive from 20 to 25 inches of rainfall per year. The Great Plains receive from 12 to 16 inches, and the southern and western portion of the state receive as little as 8 inches. Most of this rainfall occurs during summer thunderstorms. Native vegetation =New Mexico= New Mexico's mountain ranges support a wide variety of plant life. In the Rocky Mountains, the slopes have forests of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and aspen trees at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the forests include Engelmann spruce, firs, Rocky Mountain white pine, and various aspens. Above the timberline of the mountains is alpine tundra. Most other mountain ranges in New Mexico predominantly include ponderosa pine and Douglas firs. Most of the rest of the state is grassland, and in the west there is desert shrub vegetation interspersed with the grasslands. These areas include pinyon and juniper trees, sagebrush, yuccas, cacti, and creosote bushes. =Arizona= On the mountain slopes of Arizona, there are forests of Ponderosa pine, firs, and other evergreen trees. These trees, especially the Ponderosa pine, are the main source of Arizona's commercial timber. At lower elevations, the main natural trees are the pinyon, juniper, and oak. =Nevada= Nevada has vegetation similar to New Mexico and Arizona in many ways. Desert shrub ecosystems, of which sagebrush makes a huge part, cover nearly 55 million acres of the land. About 14 percent (or 9.2 million acres) of Nevada lies in Pinyon-Juniper forests, and the mountainous regions are covered with coniferous or alpine trees, depending on the altitude. History of agriculture Native Americans have been in the Southwest United States for at least 12,000 years. Although the agricultural practices of ancient Native Americans is largely unknown in the area, it is known that agriculture was widespread by the arrival of the Pueblos by 100 BC at the latest. The Pueblos relied heavily on hunting and fishing for sustenance at first, only growing pumpkins and corn. They stored their food in pits, and lived in either caves or huts made out of wooden poles and clay. Around 500 CE, the Pueblos began growing beans and domesticated the turkey and duck. It was around this time that agriculture became as important a part of survival as hunting and fishing, because they had a slightly more diverse agricultural diet. Once agriculture became more prevalent and useful, the Pueblos began to group together in larger numbers, forming groups of many connected houses, with basements full of stored food. Between 1000 and 1500 CE, Native American agriculture expanded greatly. Around this time, the Navajos and Apaches became the largest population in the area. They began to grow cotton, melons, squash, and chili peppers in addition to corn, beans, and pumpkins. The Native Americans in the Southwest used the most advanced agricultural techniques available at the time. They frequently employed the use of irrigation, crop rotation, and windbreaks to maximize their crop yield. These techniques were presumably borrowed from the people of Mexico and the Andes in the south. When the Spaniards arrived in North America in the 1500s, they brought bananas, wheat, sheep, and cows. All of these were incorporated into the diet of many Native American tribes of the Southwest. Modern agriculture Today, agriculture is vastly different from before Europeans came to the Americas. Because the Southwest United States is so dry and hot and the soil is inadequate compared to places like the Great Plains in the Midwest, much of the Southwest is used for grazing livestock. In fact, almost 60 percent of the land in Nevada is used for livestock grazing, and at least 35 percent in New Mexico and Arizona. Conversely, Nevada has the smallest amount of land used for crop production, while New Mexico has the most. Although there is a small amount of land that is specified as being dedicated to the growing of crops in the Southwest, crop production does play a large part in their economy. First of all, much of the land designated as cattle grazing land is also used to grow alfalfa hay. This is used to feed livestock, so cattle and sheep farmers tend to grow it to feed their animals, and sell it when they are in excess. =Livestock= In New Mexico, as in Arizona and Nevada, livestock is the principal economic generator in their agricultural industry. In 2007, the state produced over $3.0 billion worth of cattle and sheep. Of that, $1.3 billion was from the dairy industry, while $951 million was from the beef industry. That year, there were 1.5 million cattle and 130,000 sheep in the state. Arizona's livestock industry comprises over one third of its $2.4 billion annual industry. Nevada's main agricultural output is also beef, followed by hay and dairy products. =Crops= Most of the cropland in the Southwest United States is used to grow hay. This is mainly because there are better places in the United States to grow soil-intensive crops, such as the Great Plains and much of California. In New Mexico, 1.55 million tons of hay were grown in 2007. In Nevada, over 90 percent of the cropland is used to grow hay. Alfalfa hay is also the number one crop of Arizona. In 2008, Arizona's hay crop sold for $288 million. Other than hay, the southwestern states do produce a good amount of crops which grow well in warm climates. Arizona's crops, excluding hay, make about $1.9 billion per year. Cotton, lettuce, and wheat are the largest contributors in terms of money, but they also produce a significant amount of potatoes, lemons, tangerines, and cantaloupes. Over 49,000 dry tons of chili peppers were grown in New Mexico in 2007, 35 million pounds of peanuts were grown, and 63,000 acres were used for onion production. New Mexico is also a significant producer of pinto beans and grapes. Since Nevada uses 90 percent of its cropland to grow hay, it is not a major contributor to other crops. Nevada does grow potatoes, wheat, barley, and onions, as the rest of the southwest states do. They also grow mint and garlic. =Agricultural practices= Since most agriculture in the Southwest United States is in the form of raising livestock, there is not a tremendous concern with irrigation practices for crops. However, the Southwest employs the heaviest irrigation of any region, since the region is hot and dry, and the soil is generally not as conducive to plant growth as other areas of the country. =Environmental impact= It has been estimated that livestock, namely cattle, make up about 16 percent of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Also, although cropland takes up a small portion of land, irrigation for crops accounts for 80 percent of water consumption in the Southwest. A lot of this water is coming from the Colorado River, which is already almost completely used up by the time the water reaches Mexico. About half of irrigation water comes from groundwater in the Southwest, and this is also being used much faster than it is being replenished. If climate change raises the temperatures in the Southwest, then this will increase the amount of water that evaporates from the soil, plants, and bodies of water. Since the 1970s more water has been evaporated from reservoirs than is used by humans.

These species were considered to belong in the genus Cordyceps until molecular phylogenetics studies found these species to be more closely related to Ophiocordyceps and were considered to belong in that genus before they were transferred to the new genus Elaphocordyceps by Sung and colleagues in 2007. However, under the ICN's 2011 \\"one fungus, one name\\" principle, fungi can not have different names for their anamorphic and teleomorphic stages if they are found to be the same taxon.

Description The shell is greenish brown and roughly an equilateral triangle in profile with a slightly wavy thickened edge on the bottom of the whorl and sculpture consisting of fine diagonal spiral ridges. The single most striking feature is a brilliant spot of reddish-orange at the base of the umbilical pit which is bordered by a dark brown to black outer edge. Average height is 55 mm, and average diameter is 65 mm. Drawing with two views of a shell of Uvanilla olivacea The acute, imperforate shell has a conic shape. Its color pattern is olive-green or brownish. The 6‚Äì7 whorls are slightly convex, obliquely finely striate, longitudinally finely plicate. The folds stand at right angles to the striae, and are interrupted one-third of the distance from the suture to the periphery by two spiral impressed furrows. The linear suture is undulating. The peripheral carina is slightly nodose. The base of the shell is concave, radiately finely lamellose striate, with a somewhat nodulose rib revolving midway between the periphery and the center. The oblique aperture is silvery white within. it is angled and channelled at its outer side. The base is nearly straight. The arched columella is deeply excavated at the position of the umbilicus. The whole umbilical area is brilliant vermilion, with a black spiral rib. The oval operculum is black to yellowish inside, with a marginal apex, frequently concealed by growth of the last whorl. Its white outer surface is strongly bicostate.G.W.

Science Tribune. Life Ettre was born in Szombathely, Hungary and received a degree equivalent to a Masters of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1946 from the Technical University, Budapest. He later received a technical doctorate (Tech.) from the same institution. He and his wife, Kitty (Polonyi) Ettre (192?‚Äì199?) immigrated to the United States in 1958. They had one daughter. Work From 1946 through 1956 Ettre worked at pharmaceutical and chemical engineering firms in Hungary. In 1956 he was appointed to the position of head of the Industrial Department of the Hungarian Research Institute on Plastics in Budapest. He held the position of chemical engineer at Lurgi AG in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, where he began to work with gas chromatography. In the United States, Ettre worked at the PerkinElmer Corporation from 1958 until his retirement in 1990; he held the positions of Application Engineer, Product Specialist, Chief Applications Chemist, and Senior Staff Scientist, and finally Senior Scientist. Ettre's major research area was chromatography. His activities covered a variety of fields including surface area studies, trace analysis, detector response, reaction gas chromatography, the retention index system, headspace gas chromatography, and in particular the theory and practice of open-tubular (capillary) column gas chromatography. After his retirement, he focused on the history and evolution of chromatography and its relationship to other scientific disciplines. The history and variations of Hungarian philately in the period 1900 ‚Äì 1944 was one of his lesser-known activities, in which he authored several monographs published by the Society for Hungarian Philately. Academia Ettre was a Senior Lecturer and Adjunct Professor at several universities; Veszpr√©m University, Budapest, Hungary (1950‚Äì1952), the University of Houston, Texas, United States (1986‚Äì1968), Johannes Kepler University, Linz Austria, and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States (1977 - 1978, 1988‚Äì200?), where he was Adjunct Professor and Research Affiliate. Ettre served as an editor of Chromatographia from 1970 ‚Äì 1994, when he became a member of the journal's Advisory Board. He served on the Editorial Advisory Boards of the Journal of Chromatographic Science (1963‚Äì1994) and the Journal of Liquid Chromatography (1984‚Äì1993), and on the Editorial Advisory Boards of LC/GC Magazine in both the North America and Europe editions, as well as of the Magyar Kemikusok Lapja (Hungarian Chemical Journal). He was the author of the column ‚ÄúMilestones in Chromatography,‚Äù in LC/GC Magazine from 1999 until 2008. Ettre was a member of the Commission on Analytical Nomenclature of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (I.U.P.A.C.) from 1982 ‚Äì 1990, where he was responsible for the development of the \\"Unified Nomenclature for Chromatography\\" issued in 1993. He also served as a member of the Executive Committee of the American Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Committee E-19 on Chromatography (1966 ‚Äì 1973); as a foreign member of the Executive Committee of the (British) Chromatographic Society (1992‚Äì1997); and as an Executive Committee member of the Chromatography Subdivision of the Division of Analytical Chemistry of the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.). Leslie Ettre Award In 2008, the Leslie Ettre Award of the International Symposium on Capillary Chromatography was established by the PerkinElmer Corporation. The award is given each year to a scientist, 35 years old or younger, for the most interesting original research in capillary gas chromatography in environmental and food safety.

White is credited with being the co-creator, and the only American creator, of the original call for the Occupy Wall Street protests. His book, The End Of Protest: A New Playbook For Revolution, was published by Knopf Canada in 2016.  Biography  White \\"was born to a Caucasian mother and an African-American father\\". He attended Grand Blanc Community High School in Grand Blanc, Michigan. There he started a controversial student atheists club. As part of his experience he published an Op-Ed piece \\"Atheists Under Siege\\" in the July 21, 1999 issue of the New York Times. He was also interviewed on Politically Incorrect and received the 1999 Ruth Jokinen Memorial Student Activist Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation. He earned a B.A. at Swarthmore College and an M.A. and Ph.D. at the European Graduate School. At the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, White was working as senior editor for Adbusters magazine with Occupy Wall Street co-creator Kalle Lasn. White ran the Adbusters Twitter account, and sent the first tweet to use the hashtag #OccupyWallStreet from that account. As the Occupy Wall Street movement gained momentum, White served as the group's unofficial publicist, though he was located in Berkeley, California, and not New York. After a group of Occupy Wall Street activists sought to raise funds for the movement by selling posters, White, who had already left Adbusters, took over Adbusters' Twitter account to declare support for the sale. After Adbusters regained control of the account, White referred to his actions as a \\"playful insurrection\\".  Awards  In December 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle included White in a list of the \\"most fascinating people in the Bay Area 2011\\". In December 2014, Esquire Magazine named White one of the most influential people under 35 years of age. In 2018, White was awarded the Roddenberry Fellowship, Voqal Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at Bard College. In 2019, he was the Activist-in- Residence at UCLA. In the Fall of 2020, White is co-teaching a seminar at Princeton University. Political views White is in favor of a transaction tax on international financial speculation, the reinstatement of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act and revocation of corporate personhood. He is against advertisement and consumerism. He believes that \\"clicktivism\\", which denotes a form of internet-based activism and includes signing online petitions, is damaging to the possibility of political change. In January 2020, White attended the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The meeting is often attended by business and political leaders, whom White protested when he was a part of Occupy Wall Street.

In the 1940s he became one of the founding members of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Psicoan√°lisis (-APA- Argentine Psychoanalytic Association) and in the 1950s participated in the creation of the first private school of Social Psychology and the Instituto Argentino de Estudios Sociales (-IADES-, Argentine Institute of Social Studies). The originality of his theory is based on the dialectical view of the functioning of the groups and the relationship between dialectic, homeostasis and cybernetic.  Biography  Pichon-Rivi√®re was born on June 25, 1907 in Geneva, Switzerland, his parents were French. His father had two daughters and three sons from a first marriage, when she died, his father remarried with his sister-in-law, first cousin of his dead wife. Enrique is the only one born of this marriage and, consequently, the youngest of the family. Both Alphonse and Josephine, his parents, disowned their bourgeois origins, embracing progressive ideas and a rebellious attitude to cultural norms of the time, both were fans of \\"rebel\\" poetry such as Rimbaud and Baudelaire, with strong socialist convictions and rejected racism and sexist stereotypes that prevailed at the start of the 20th century. In 1910, his family went to Buenos Aires and later moved to Chaco. His father, who had been a soldier in the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, was sent by his family to England to learn about the textile industry, then the family decided to move to Argentina, for reasons that Enrique Pichon-Rivi√®re himself said he was unaware, and his father began to exploit land concessions granted by the Argentine State, where he tried to produce cotton, but without success. Thus, they had to move to Corrientes, a city on the Paran√° River, with permanent flood and forest environment, a place where he spent his childhood. He was influenced by the Guarani culture, he had daily contact with the indigenous and their peasant modest lives. There, he learned to speak French first and then the Guaran√≠ and Castilian. When Enrique was 6 or 7 years old, he learned what he called \\"the great family secret\\": his brothers and sisters were actually his stepbrothers and stepsisters. He attended high school in the city of Goya and, upon completion, he founded the Partido Socialista de Goya. In 1924 he began his medical studies in the city of Rosario, ending in 1936 in the city of Buenos Aires. In Rosario he worked for a while as \\"instructor of manners\\" for sex workers of Polish origin in a brothel (whorehouse). Later he studied Anthropology, leaving the career to devote himself to psychiatry and to psychoanalysis. He began his practice as a psychiatrist at the El Asilo de Torres (Tower Asylum), located in the vicinity of Luj√°n, Buenos Aires. Later, he moved to Buenos Aires, where he would work in another sanatorium and as a journalist in the newspaper La Cr√≠tica (\\"The Critic\\") (1930‚Äì1931), in this period he became interested in poetry, paying particular attention to the French Po√®te maudit and Isidore Ducasse. When he finished his studies, he began working at the Hospice of Mercy, now known as Interdisciplinary Psicoasistencial Hospital \\"Jose Tiburcio Borda\\", a place which played professionally for 15 years. In the early 1940s, founded with Angel Garma, Celes Ernesto Carcamo, Marie Langer and Arnaldo Rascovsky, the Asociaci√≥n Psicoanal√≠tica Argentina (APA) (Argentine Psychoanalytic Association) of which then he would leave, becoming interested in the social aspect and activity of society groups, leading him to work at the Escuela de Psicolog√≠a Din√°mica (School of Psychology) of the then called Escuela de Psicolog√≠a Social (School of social Psychology). In 1937 he married with the renowned psychoanalyst Arminda Aberastury, who was known for her friendship with his brother, Federico, and she was one of the members of the newly formed APA; Aberastury influenced in the theories developed by Pichon-Rivi√®re, given the expertise that she had made in the studies of Melanie Klein and Sophie Morgenstern methods. In 1953 Enrique created the first private school of Social Psychology. In 1955, together with Gino Germani and with the support of the Faculty of Economics, Institute of Statistics, Faculty of Philosophy and Psychology Department and the Faculty of Medicine at Rosario founded the Instituto Argentino de Estudios Sociales (Argentine Institute of Social Studies -IADES-), assuming the role of director. In 1972, his wife Aberastury decided to commit suicide, according to some people close to the family for a skin disease that had disfigured her. Pichon-Riviere began a relationship with his former student and collaborator Ana Quiroga, whom he met in 1965.

He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Boston Red Sox on May 2, 2012, and played with them through 2014. He also played in MLB for the San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers and Texas Rangers. A fifth round draft pick in the 2007 MLB draft out of Liberty- Eylau High School in Texarkana, Texas, Middlebrooks signed with the Red Sox for $925,000, bypassing his commitment to Texas A&M; University. Middlebrooks was originally a shortstop, but the Red Sox converted him into a third baseman in the minor leagues. He represented the United States in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. Following Middlebrooks' emergence as the Red Sox's starting third baseman in 2012, the organization traded former All-Star Kevin Youkilis. After struggles in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the Red Sox traded Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres before the 2015 season. He signed minor league contracts with the Brewers and Rangers before the 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively. Amateur career Middlebrooks attended Liberty-Eylau High School in Texarkana, Texas. He played shortstop and pitched for the high school baseball team. As a pitcher, he could reach with his fastball. Liberty- Eylau won the Class 3A state championship in 2006, Middlebrooks' junior season. In his senior season, Middlebrooks had a .555 batting average with 22 stolen bases and 48 runs batted in (RBIs) in 38 games, and a 13-0 win‚Äìloss record as a pitcher. He was named to the Class 3A All-State First Team and Class 3A Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association. In addition to baseball, Middlebrooks played American football and basketball in high school. A quarterback, placekicker and punter, he played on the school's football team, which also featured LaMichael James. He was named an All-State punter. Middlebrooks admits that he preferred football, until he realized during his junior year that he had the opportunity to be selected in the Major League Baseball draft. In November 2006, he committed to attend Texas A&M; University on a full scholarship to play baseball and football for the Texas A&M; Aggies. Professional career Middlebrooks was an athletic defensive player and hit for power and was also credited for his contact skills, although he was not considered the most patient hitter. His throwing arm was well regarded, and his baserunning was rated as average. =Boston Red Sox= Minor leagues Middlebrooks had been projected as a first round talent in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. However, the belief that he would follow through with his scholarship to Texas A&M; led Middlebrooks to fall in the draft. The Boston Red Sox drafted Middlebrooks in the fifth round of the draft, selecting him as a shortstop, rather than as a pitcher. He received a $925,000 signing bonus to renege on his commitment to Texas A&M.; Middlebrooks made his professional debut in 2008 with the Lowell Spinners of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League, where he batted .254 with one home run. He described himself as developmentally behind other players at his level because of the time he had devoted to football. Initially a shortstop, Middlebrooks made the transition to third base as he added muscle, increasing from at the time he was drafted to . In 2009, Middlebrooks played for the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, where he batted .265 with seven home runs and 57 RBIs. He was promoted to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 2010 and responded by batting .276 with 12 home runs and 70 RBIs. Middlebrooks began the 2011 season playing for the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League. He played in the Eastern League All-Star Game, hitting a double in the game. Middlebrooks also participated in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game, starting at third base and going 1-for-2. Through August 2011, Middlebrooks batted .306 with 18 home runs and 80 RBIs for Portland, at which point he was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League. Joe McDonald of ESPN.com called Middlebrooks \\"Boston's likely [third baseman] of the future\\" upon his promotion from Portland to Pawtucket. He hit .161 in 16 games with Pawtucket to close out the 2011 season. After the 2011 season, the Red Sox assigned Middlebrooks to the Arizona Fall League, where he hit four home runs in 13 games and was named to the Rising Stars Game. In November 2011, Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin, and Drake Britton were added to the Red Sox 40-man roster to protect them from being selected in the Rule 5 draft. Heading into the 2012 season, Baseball America rated Middlebrooks as the Red Sox' best prospect and 51st best prospect overall. Starting the 2012 season with Pawtucket, Middlebrooks hit .333 with nine home runs and 27 RBIs in 24 games and 93 at- bats. Meanwhile, Red Sox starting third baseman Kevin Youkilis struggled, opening the 2012 season batting .219. As Youkilis struggled, Middlebrooks appeared to be ready for a promotion. 2012 season The Red Sox promoted Middlebrooks to the major leagues on May 2, 2012, when Youkilis was placed on the disabled list. He made his MLB debut that day, drawing a walk in his first plate appearance and recording two hits. On May 6, he hit a game-tying grand slam for his first major league home run in what was eventually a 17-inning loss to the Baltimore Orioles. In his first 41 games with the Red Sox, Middlebrooks batted .326 with nine home runs and 34 RBIs, the most RBIs to start a career for a member of the Red Sox since Walt Dropo recorded 37 RBIs in his first 41 career games dating back to 1949‚Äì50. Bobby Valentine, the manager of the Red Sox, initially alternated between Middlebrooks and Youkilis at third base. However, Middlebrooks' emergence led the Red Sox to trade Youkilis on June 23. Middlebrooks was named American League Player of the Week for the week ending June 24. Middlebrooks broke a bone in his right hand when he was hit by a pitch in a game against the Cleveland Indians on August 10, ending his rookie season with a .288 batting average, 15 home runs and 54 RBIs in 75 games played. 2013 season Middlebrooks with the Pawtucket Red Sox in 2014 On April 7, 2013, Middlebrooks hit three home runs in a 13‚Äì0 Red Sox victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in Toronto. Two of his home runs were hit off of pitcher R.A. Dickey. However, he lost playing time to Jos√© Iglesias after he strained his back in May. After he batted .192 on the season, the Red Sox optioned Middlebrooks to Pawtucket on June 25, 2013. The Red Sox opted not to promote Middlebrooks when they traded Iglesias on July 30, using Brandon Snyder and Brock Holt instead. After Middlebrooks made adjustments, the Red Sox recalled him from Pawtucket on August 10. In Game 3 of the 2013 World Series, Middlebrooks was ruled to have obstructed future teammate Allen Craig after diving for an errant throw at third base. The play awarded Craig the game winning run for the Cardinals. The Red Sox won the series over the Cardinals. 2014 season In 2014, Middlebrooks missed 19 games in April due to a strained calf. In May, he broke a finger, and again went on the disabled list. He had been struggling at the plate to begin the season hitting just .197 with two home runs in 21 games. As he rehabilitated his injury in the minor leagues, Middlebrooks began playing in the outfield, due to the Red Sox' signing of Stephen Drew. After the Red Sox traded Drew, they hoped that Middlebrooks would improve his performance with more regular playing time. Middlebrooks continued to miss time later in the season due to lingering effects of the hand injury. He finished the 2014 season with a .191 average in 215 at-bats. =San Diego Padres= During the 2014‚Äì15 offseason, the Red Sox signed free agent Pablo Sandoval, a third baseman. On December 19, 2014, the Red Sox traded Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres for Ryan Hanigan, whom the Padres had acquired earlier the same day. Middlebrooks competed with Yangervis Solarte to be the Padres' starting third baseman in spring training. With Middlebrooks batting .212 on the season, the Padres optioned Middlebrooks to the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) on July 22. On December 2, 2015, the Padres non-tendered Middlebrooks, making him a free agent. =Milwaukee Brewers= On December 15, 2015, Middlebrooks agreed to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers assigned him to the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the PCL to start the 2016 season. Middlebrooks batted .282 with 10 home runs and 47 RBIs for Colorado Springs, before he was promoted to the major leagues on July 4. After batting .111 in ten games for Milwaukee, he went on the disabled list with a strained leg. The Brewers activated him from the disabled list and outrighted him off of the 40-man roster on August 30. =Texas Rangers= Middlebrooks signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers on November 11, 2016. He began the 2017 season with the Round Rock Express of the PCL. He spent most of 2017 with the Express until he was called up by the Rangers in September. He became the first player in over 100 years to hit a pinch-hit triple in both games of a doubleheader on September 6, 2017, against the Atlanta Braves. =Philadelphia Phillies= On January 3, 2018, Middlebrooks signed a minor-league contract that included an invitation to spring training with the Philadelphia Phillies. On February 25, Middlebrooks broke his leg in a spring training game against the Orioles, and because of this injury, he did not appear in a game during the 2018 season. He elected free agency on November 2, 2018, and on January 10, 2019, he announced his retirement. Personal life Middlebrooks grew up in Texarkana, Texas. His father, Tom, serves as the head baseball coach and assistant football coach at Liberty- Eylau, and his younger sister, Lacey, played softball for the University of Tulsa. She is now an assistant softball coach at Columbus State University in Columbus, Georgia. Middlebrooks' mother, Julie, and youngest sister, Mary, are artists; Julie is an art teacher. He has been friends with Ryan Mallett of the Baltimore Ravens since they met in a football camp after Mallett moved to the Texarkana area in the seventh grade. Middlebrooks was engaged to Ann Lux, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader; however, they broke up in August 2012. They are from the same hometown and have known each other since age 12. Later in 2012, Middlebrooks began dating Jenny Dell, a field reporter who covered the Red Sox for the New England Sports Network. They became engaged in July 2014, and were married in February 2016. Middlebrooks and Dell had their first child, a daughter named Madison Dell Middlebrooks, in October 2018. A second daughter, Makenzie Grey, arrived in December 2019. Dell struggled to get pregnant and used fertility treatments.

It was aired on the channel space of the preschool- oriented cable channel Nick Jr.. The brand debuted online in November 2011, ahead of its television launch in October 2012. The block carried ad-supported comedy programming targeting an adult female demographic, particularly mothers, from 10:00 p.m ET nightly. The launch of NickMom initially generated controversy; as Nick Jr. only operated a single feed out of the Eastern Time Zone, the usually child-oriented network would transition into content inappropriate for such audiences in the early evening or afternoon depending on time zones. On launch, viewership of the block was significantly lower than that of the children's programming it replaced, and other 24-hour preschool networks such as Disney Junior, Sprout, BabyFirstTV and BabyTV took advantage of the gap in programming to build their own audiences. On September 28, 2015, NickMom ended its three-year run, and Nick Jr. once again became a 24-hour channel. The NickMom website was also shut down by Viacom and the domain now redirects to Nickelodeon's Parental Resources section of the Nick site. History =Launch= In November 2011, Viacom announced that it would launch a new block on Nick Jr. for the 2012-13 television season known as NickMom, which would be aimed towards young mothers, as part of the company's \\"cradle-to-grave\\" strategy where viewers grow into watching other Viacom networks (from Nick Jr. to Nickelodeon, then MTV, VH1 and then TV Land and formerly, CBS and Showtime). The company explained that \\"today's moms who grew up with Nickelodeon have a renewed relationship with us through their kids\\", and that the new brand would \\"offer a destination that is unique in today's entertainment landscape with content that taps into Nickelodeon's comedic DNA\\". Unlike Nick Jr.'s main programming, which was commercial-free at the time, NickMom was to be commercially supported, having recently reached sponsorship deals with General Mills and Reckitt Benckiser. Over 30 projects were in development for the block at the time of the announcement. =Closure= On September 9, 2015, the network's Twitter and Facebook accounts released a statement explaining that the NickMom programming block and website would cease operations by the end of September 2015 and by the beginning of October 2015 due to Viacom's 2015 cutbacks involving acquired programming and also due to the programming block's low ratings. NickMom ended its three-year run at 2 a.m. ET on September 28 after a showing of the movie Guarding Tess, three days shy to its third anniversary, without embellishment at its end. Shortly after, the network's website address was redirected to Nickelodeon's site for parental resources. Programming Original programming which launched with the block included Parental Discretion with Stefanie Wilder-Taylor, MFF: Mom Friends Forever, NickMom Night Out, and What Was Carol Brady Thinking?, featuring comedic commentary from Carol Brady within episodes of The Brady Bunch in the style of Pop-Up Video (Florence Henderson herself had no involvement in What Was Carol Brady Thinking?, with commentary penned by writers not involved with the original series). By June 2013, some of the programs and movies (Yours, Mine and Ours (2005), Imagine That, Nacho Libre, and The Spiderwick Chronicles) airing on the block had been replaced with syndicated shows already airing on Nick at Nite (or with their rights dormant on that channel), such as The New Adventures of Old Christine and Yes, Dear. Not including Instant Mom (whose second season aired on Nickelodeon and NickMom, but moved to TV Land for its third), the majority of the block's original shows were canceled due to low ratings or creative differences. In 2015, Movie feature presentations were added to the schedule, with family-friendly movies such as Babe and its sequel Pig in the City most prevalent, along with other female-focused titles such as Eat Pray Love. After acquiring its syndication rights, NickMom began airing the 2010 iteration of the NBC family drama, Parenthood, in April 2015 (rights for that show transferred to Up after NickMom's demise as a complement to Gilmore Girls being carried by that network recently and featuring Lauren Graham as a star in both series). Controversy The block launched with heavy controversy. As Nick Jr. operated on only one feed that broadcast on a default Eastern Time Zone schedule without a secondary feed for the Pacific Time Zone, NickMom programming started at 7 p.m. Pacific Time, and in time zones further west outside the continental United States, 6 p.m. in the Alaska Time Zone, and 5 p.m. in the Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone (4 p.m. from mid-March to early November, as Hawaii does not observe DST). Many parents found the scheduling inappropriate, given the supposed sexual, coarse, and child-bashing humor, and uncensored light profanity of the network's launch schedule of programming. Parents also felt that the purpose and lure of the network with full-time preschool programming was nullified in the pursuit of increasing ratings with content not meant for children. The inappropriate scheduling due to one feed was rectified in mid-February 2013, when VMN launched a second Pacific Time Zone-based feed for Nick Jr. which also applied to NickMom. The content of the block's website was also criticized early on for the same reasons, along with earlier allegations that the staff of the network's website took content from other websites, including pictures of children, without any attribution or credit, and without permission. Subsequently, Nielsen ratings for the NickMom block's first week plunged 75% from that same period the year prior when Nick Jr. and Noggin programs aired in the timeslot, with some shows registering a \\"scratch\\" as being unrated due to a low sample size. Petitions were organized to encourage advertisers to pull their sponsorships from the block, with some online parenting community forum members demanding that children's programming return to the channel during that timeslot. Fisher Price and the General Mills brands Cheerios and Green Giant later pulled their advertising from the block by October 26, due to consumer reactions on social media. General Mills returned to advertising during the NickMom block once some of the more controversial shows were canceled or replaced with Nick at Nite-sourced content. A 2013 report from SNL Kagan and distributed by the Parents Television Council, which was opposed to the block, reported Nick Jr. as a network had a large loss of half their viewers in primetime, and of advertisers during the time the most racy of NickMom content was available before the addition of Nick at Nite content, along with a surge in the ratings of competitors Disney Junior and Sprout, which continued to air preschool- targeted programming in primetime. The report noted the ratings were among the lowest in primetime for cable networks. Although the report also listed that the network had a cash flow of -27%, Nick Jr. ran traditional advertising only during the NickMom block and sustained advertising for the rest of the broadcast day, and mainly was a loss leader as part of Nickelodeon's portion of the Viacom digital cable network suite; those networks usually make little money for the company and feature little to no advertising.

It has been described as \\"a bizarrely funny saga of a quintessential Russian institution, the interminably long line.\\" The Library Journal describes Sorokin‚Äôs work as being an ‚Äúavant- garde experiment\\" with a \\"flair of nonsense.\\" The Queue does not follow a traditional narrative style. Instead, it is told in dialogue form, so as to make the reader feel like they are part of the line. As described by the Library Journal, the text lacks description, setting, or stage direction. Instead it is filled with nothing but voices: snatches of conversation, rumors, jokes, howls of humor, roll calls, and sexy moans. Plot summary A man is waiting in a seemingly endless line, but for what? The Queue begins with a cacophony of voices and the protagonist, Vadim, encountering a lady named Lena. As the day progresses the queue-goers realize that they have no choice but to come back the next day to finally receive their items. A woman comes along handing out numbers so that the next day there will be limited chaos. Vadim and Lena end up spending the night in the park on benches along with other members of the queue. And again the same process begins all over again; people sharing their speculations of what‚Äôs being sold, others trying to figure out the rate that the line is moving, and the occasional break from waiting in the queue to get food or drink‚Äîessentially waiting in other queues. After this ensues yet another roll-call emphasizing just how many people are waiting for unknown objects. Finally after two days of waiting it appears that the end of the line is in site, but suddenly it begins pouring and Vadim seeks shelter. He is taken into an apartment owned by a lady named Lyuda. After a simple meal and an intelligent discussion, the two of them make love and fall asleep. The next morning Lyuda reveals that she works at the store everyone is queued up for, and that his days of waiting were in vain. Character Descriptions ;Lena: Lena is the young protagonist of the novel. She is first introduced in the novel while she is waiting in line for an unknown product. Lena studies at the Textiles Institute. She is unsure what her place is society is, and seeks to find an identity through relationships. ;Vadim: Vadim is the other protagonist in the novel, who is first introduced when he meets Lena in line. Vadim is part of the Intelligentsia class, making his role in Post Soviet Russia a complicated matter to find. He studied history at Moscow State University, and works editing articles for a technical journal. ;Volodya: Volodya is young boy waiting alongside his mother in line. Unlike the many other characters of The Queue, Volodya is innocent and unaware of the wrongs in society. ;Lyudmila: Lyudmila is introduced in the latter part of the novel, is Vadim's key to no longer having to wait in line. She begins a spur of the moment romance with Vadim, when she seems in him in line and decides to bring him back to her house. Lyumila works at the Moskva stores, the ones distributing the goods in the line. Lyumila controls the movement of the line, and has little consideration for the many people waiting for their goods. ;The Collective: The Collective is the group of people in line. They are represented by indiscriminate voices. ;The Voice: The Voice is a nameless authority which keeps the line in order. Major Themes ;Ordinary Life: Most of the chatter up and down the queue is the kind one hears every day‚Äîit's deliberately, sometimes comically ordinary.Blaire, Elaine. \\"The Wait: on Vladimir Sorokin\\". The Nation. 25 March 2009. Retrieved 2011-12-01. This use of ordinary life within the Soviet Union demonstrates how \\"queues\\" or lines in this time period were a fundamental part of life, and the conversations which took place demonstrated how common lines had become. In fact people would refuse to buy anything without a queue because no long line means there must not be anything worth waiting for. But, if there was a queue people would line up for items they had absolutely no need for.Zemtsov, Ilya. \\"Encyclopedia of Soviet Life\\". Transaction Publishers, 1991, p. 263. ;The Passage of Time: The main character, Vadim, demonstrates the extreme length of time that large amounts of Russian citizens were willing to stand in line for an unknown, always changing items. ;Queue: Sorokin's novel parodies the Russian queue with a mix of truth and hyperbole. Lines were such a recognizable facet of the Russian experience during the Soviet Union, that the commercial newspaper Kommersant announced, were the \\"laws of our time\\". Literary Significance One of The Queue‚Äôs primary and most distinctive literary features is in its peculiar structure. The Queue is composed exclusively in dialogue, and the reader is limited to small exchanges that take place among the people waiting in line. Although a narrator never interferes with these conversations, characters do emerge from the chatter, based upon their distinct voice and interactions with others in the line. Elaine Blair writes, \\"In his fidelity to quotidian street conversation, Sorokin thumbs his nose at Socialist realism: he offers exactly the realism that would never be permitted in official Soviet writing\\".Blaire, Elaine. \\"The Wait: on Vladimir Sorokin\\". The Nation. 25 March 2009. Retrieved 2011-12-01. Some see The Queue as a comment on Soviet society, according to Mary Zirin \\"This novel reduces to delightful absurdity the rough democracy of the long lines that Soviet people-in-the-street endure in order to buy \\"luxury\\" goods.\\"Zirin, Mary. \\"The Queue (Book)\\" Library Journal. Vol. 113 Issue 11, p69. Accessed Dec 5, 2011. This literary use forces the reader to recognize subtle distinctions in voice, to determine which character, known or unknown is speaking. Also, the entire setting of The Queue is not created through descriptions, but only through casual references to the weather or location. Publication History Enjoying the Queue in Finnish The Queue, Sorokin's first novel, was initially banned in the Soviet Union but was published by the famed √©migr√© dissident Andrei Sinyavsky in France in 1985. An English translation was published by Readers International in 1988.(). The novel was later published in the United States. The English translation, by Sally Laird has received criticism for rendering the text with British idioms. Slang language like \\"a bit of alright,\\" wogs,\\" \\"here's our cuppa,\\" and \\"don't fancy that\\" have been said to distract from the overall meaning of the novel. Development History ‚ÄúMore and more people in the Soviet Union have found that diligent and conscientious work for official goals is not rewarded as much as the abuse of their position in public sectors for their personal interests or their activity in the second economy and other spheres of illegal civil society, and it does not provide the rewards of devotion to family, friends, and loved ones.\\" Ultimately, the novel speaks to the injustice in Post-Soviet society. There is no functional way to move ahead in life, unless an individual succumbs to corruption. The only sanctuary one has is in their family and friends. Explanation of Novel's Title The title The Queue represents the central focus of the novel. Instead of the book being based on the characters, it is centered on the collective movement of the line as everyone waits for their elusive items. \\"The Russian queue was not simply a social presence, but was also a social principle one that regulated social entitlements in time. It enshrined the social and psychological idea of consumption through state distribution...people stay in the queues for cars or apartments for years.\\" Pop Culture References Throughout the novel there are several references to Western culture and consumer items. In one instance the topic switches over to one of the latest Beatle‚Äôs songs‚Äîwith a great majority of people in the line being able to sing along. Even Ronald Reagan is mentioned in the discussion of American politics with the topic revolving around the debate of free speech, and whether it can truly be possible. Russian institutions are also discussed with references to Moscow University, Teachers Training, and Steel and Alloys Institute.Sorokin, Vladimir. \\"The Queue\\".

Early Years in Germany  Dober learned the trade of pottery from his father. He was converted at age 17 while visiting the Moravian church at Herrnhut. Ibid. On July 24, 1731, he heard a talk given by Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf about missions to the slaves of the Caribbean. In his talk, Zinzendorf described a former slave from the Danish island of St. Thomas named Anthony Ulrich, who believed that the slaves would be very receptive to Christian missionaries. Dober, along with his friend Tobias Leupold, felt called to go to the Caribbean, and they began to prepare for this work. Although they initially met with opposition from the Moravian Brethren, the doubts were eventually settled by drawing lots. Dober's lot read, \\"Let the lad go, for the Lord is with him,\\" but Leupold's said that he must wait. Instead, David Nitschmann was chosen to go with Dober to help start the Caribbean mission. A Brief Survey of the First Moravian Mission, by Donald C S Johnson, Grace Baptist Church of Victoria  Mission in St. Thomas  On August 20, 1732, Count Zinzendorf blessed the two young men, and after a prayer meeting sent them on to Copenhagen, where they were to find a ship bound for St. Thomas. In Copenhagen, they again met with opposition to their plans. Even Anthony Ulrich, who had originally proposed the idea, began to have second thoughts. Ibid. Christian History and Biography, Missionaries Against Terrible Odds Von Plesz, the King‚Äôs Chamberlain, asked them how they would live. ‚ÄúWe shall work,‚Äù replied Nitschmann, ‚Äúas slaves among the slaves.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù said Von Plesz, ‚Äúthat is impossible. It will not be allowed. No white man ever works as a slave.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù replied Nitschmann, ‚ÄúI am a carpenter, and will ply my trade.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut what will the potter do?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe will help me in my work.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go on like that,‚Äù exclaimed the Chamberlain, ‚Äúyou will stand your ground the wide world over.‚Äù History of the Moravian Church, Chapter VI, The Foreign Missions and Their Influence Although the Danish West Indian Company refused to grant them passage, the two men eventually found sympathy at the Danish court, and with the help of a court officer they obtained berths on a ship bound for the West Indies. Leaving Copenhagen on Oct 8, 1732, they arrived in St. Thomas two months later on December 13. Ibid. While in St. Thomas, they lived frugally and preached to the slaves, and they had a certain amount of success. The Missions of the Church of the United Brethren, pages 241-246. Dober returned to Germany in 1734 (David Nitschmann had only gone to help Dober get settled and had left after only a few weeks), but other Moravian missionaries continued the work for fifty years afterward, establishing churches on St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John‚Äôs, Jamaica, Antigua, Barbados, and St. Kitts. Moravian missionaries baptized 13,000 converts before any other missionaries arrived on the scene. History of the Moravian Church  Later Years  Dober returned to Europe since he had been chosen to serve as Chief Elder of the Moravian Brethren. As the work began to spread across the world, he realized that he could not do the job any more and it was his 1741 offer to resign that occasioned the Moravian Unity's realization that Jesus Christ is the only Head and Chief Elder of the Church. He married Anna Schindler on July 13, 1738, but she died during childbirth on December 12, 1739. In 1743 he remarried, this time to Anna Gertrude Engel. Thereafter he was consecrated a bishop, and served in Livonia from 1745. Throughout this period he made several trips to England, Holland, and Silesia. After Count Zinzendorf died in 1760, he returned to Herrnhut, where he served on the directing board of the Moravian Brethren and spent his last years. He died on April 1, 1766 and was buried in God's Acre, the community's graveyard on the Hutberg Hill in Herrnhut, Saxony, Germany. The Missions of the Church of the United Brethren, pages 241-246.  The Story of the Moravian Slaves  A popular misconception is that Dober and Nitschmann sold themselves into slavery in order to gain access to the African slaves of St. Thomas. Dreaming Beneath the Spires: John Leonard Dober and David Nitschman Emancipation of the Freed: John Leonard Dober and David Nitschman In fact, although they expressed willingness to do this, white slavery was not allowed in any of the West Indian islands, so they plied their individual trades to support themselves.

Rocky Point was located at a natural ford on the Missouri River. In prehistoric times, American bisons trailed down through the breaks to Rocky Point to cross the river. During the Missouri River steamboat era (1860s to 1880s), the buffalo trail system leading to and from the ford caused Rocky Point to become a steamboat landing, which received freight for mining camps in the Judith Mountains (to the south) and in the Little Rocky Mountains (to the north) and also for Fort Maginnis built in 1880. In the 1870s and 1880s, Rocky Point had a store, hotel, two saloons, a feed stable, a blacksmith shop and a ferry. Due to its remote location in the Missouri Breaks, in the 1870s and 1880s Rocky Point became a refuge for outlaws who turned to rustling cattle and horses until rancher- vigilantes took punitive action in 1884. From 1886 to 1936 it had a post office near by which was known as Wilder and so the community of Rocky Point was sometimes also called Wilder. The community at the Rocky Point ford continued through the homesteading years from 1900 to 1918, but faded away when the ferry ceased to function in the 1920s, and it finally disappeared in 1936 when the Army Corps of Engineers condemned and bought up land adjacent to the Missouri River that might possibly be affected by Ft Peck Dam, then being built. Today some historic but deteriorating structures still remain on the site, which is now on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Being on public lands the Rocky Point ford area may be approached by \\"dirt\\" roads and visited, but the roads become impassable when wet. Before 1900 ‚Äì steamboat landing, wood hawk yard, Missouri River crossing point and ferry =Prehistoric crossing point on the Missouri= At Rocky Point the Missouri River flows over a Bearpaw shale reef. This provided a rocky bottom and a low-water ford.Axline, Jon, Conveniences Sorely Needed: Montana's Historic Highway Bridges, 1860-1956, Montana Historical Society Press, 2005, p. 119, 120. This geologic feature made Rocky Point a crossing point on the Missouri for migrating buffalo since prehistoric times. The migrating buffalo established trails from the broad grassy plains on the north and south of the river, down through the breaks to the site of Rocky Point. =Steamboat landing ‚Äì 1860s to the 1880s= With the discovery of gold in the Montana Territory in the early 1860s, the Missouri River became the main thoroughfare by which passengers and freight, particularly bulky freight, was moved by steamboats between the gold fields in the Montana Territory, and the \\"states\\". In Montana the river ran through the Missouri Breaks for hundreds of miles. The breaks are steeply eroded badlands that severely limit access to the Missouri River. Rocky Point naturally became a steamboat landing because of its system of prehistoric buffalo trail system that led from the ford up through the breaks to the plains that lay north and south of the river. The steamboat era lasted from the mid-1860s until the coming of the railroad in the mid to late 1880s. After 1874, when the Northern Pacific Railroad reached Bismark, the riverboats usually brought freight from that river port to the terminus port at Ft. Benton, Montana. Rocky Point's steamboat landing received and sent only the freight and passengers generated by local demand in the surrounding sparsely settled area. The upriver terminus port for Missouri River steamboats was Ft. Benton, Montana Territory. Steamboats had to get up to Ft. Benton on the spring rise in the Missouri River flow, caused by the outflow of snow melt from the mountains. High water was in June, after which the level in the river fell. During low-water periods many larger boats bound for Fort Benton were forced to unload at points lower down on the river. These unloaded cargoes were either freighted overland, picked up by smaller boats or stored until the next high-water season. Some of this interrupted freight traffic during low water seasons on the Missouri brought business to the Rocky Point landing, but in low water the steamboats attempted to reach Cow Island landing, further up the river, because from Cow Island there was a better freight route up Cow Creek to Fort Benton. Gold discoveries in the Judith Mountains, at Maiden, and in the Little Rocky Mountains increased interest in Rocky Point as a landing point for the mill machinery coming by boat. The mines in the Judith Mountains, to the southwest of Rocky Point were discovered in 1880. The gold strikes in the Little Rockies (a small outlier mountain range on the Eastern Montana plains) was first made as a placer gold strike in 1884 but this placer strike only lasted a few years. By 1881 Rocky Point was the designated Missouri River steamboat landing point for people and goods coming and going from Fort Maginnis, Montana Territory, 63 miles away.Annual report of the Secretary of War By United States. War Dept, 1881, Vol. 1, Washington Government Printing Office, p. p. 68 indicating Rocky Point as the Missouri River steamboat landing for Ft. Maginnis, Montana Territory, 63 miles away. The Northern Pacific Railroad completed its line through the southern portion of Montana in 1883, which severely reduced steamboat traffic to Ft. Benton. In 1887 the Great Northern Railroad built through the area just north of the Missouri River breaks, and this finally terminated steamboat traffic on the Missouri. =Wood hawk yards ‚Äì 1860s to the 1880s= Wood hawk yards developed along the Missouri River to supply fuel to passing steamboats. At these remote locations men known as wood hawks would harvest trees from cottonwood groves along the river, and stack the wood in cords along the river banks. Steamboats traveling on the Missouri would stop and buy the cords of wood to burn for fuel. The flat on the south side of the river near Rocky Point became one of the many wood hawk camps along the river. In 1868 Lohmire and Lee were located there. In 1871 fugitives from an Indian encounter sought refuge at a woodchopper's cabin there. =Buffalo hide hunters ‚Äì late 1870s to 1883= After 1876, military campaigns against Indian tribes reduced the danger from roving and hostile bands of Indians on the Eastern Montana plains. Buffalo hides had a market because they were used for belting for industrial machines. As the threat from Indian bands decreased, commercial market hunters for buffalo, sometimes called \\"hide hunters\\", began to roam over the Eastern Montana prairie and kill buffalo in large numbers, taking only the hide. Commercial hunters in the vicinity of Rocky Point brought their hides down to the steamboat landing, where a middleman‚Äîusually a local merchant‚Äîbought the hides and then shipped them east by steamboat. By 1883 there were so few buffalo left that the day of the commercial market hunter came to an end. =Missouri River crossing point for cattle herds= As cattle replaced buffalo on the plains of Eastern Montana the ford at Rocky Point became a crossing point for large cattle herds. A large rancher trailing a herd to the ford at Rocky Point during a drought had this experience. > \\"At last we were nearing the Missouri River, intending to cross at Rocky > Point. The wind was from the north and cattle smelled the water and broke > for it. No power on earth could stop the poor thirsty beasts; bellowing and > lowing they ran pell-mell for the water, with the cowboys in hot pursuit. > There was a point of quicksand in the river just above the ford and before > the men could prevent it the cattle had plunged into it and were miring > down. A small steamboat tied at the landing used their donkey engine to help > drag out some of them, but we lost seventy head in spite of our best > efforts. After this mishap we crossed the herd without further trouble and > from here on there was more water and better grass.\\"Stuart, Granville, > Pioneering In Montana, University of Nebraska Press, 1977, , p. 233. =Ferry= The trail system down to the ford at Rocky Point made it a natural point to have a ferry. As long as Rocky Point was used as a Missouri River crossing point in the breaks, the ferry continued, from the 1880s to the late 1920s. By 1885 John Tyler was the ferryman. Stock detective Charles Siringo journeyed from Lewistown, Montana to the Little Rocky Mountains, and described his crossing of the Missouri River at Rocky Point. > \\"I arrived in Rocky Point on the south bank of the Big Muddy river three > hours after dark. Here I found old man Tyler and his son running the ferry > and keeping a small Indian trading store.\\"Siringo, Charles A., A Cowboy > Detective: A True Story of Twenty-two Years With A World-Famous Detective > Agency, W.B. Conkey Company, 1912, p. 328. In 1907 Elmer Turner bought the ferry at Rocky Point from Tyler, and he ran the Ferry until 1927 when he dismantled it and used the lumber in buildings at Rocky Point. Gumbo mud in the Missouri Breaks When the clay dirt of the Missouri Breaks becomes wet, it first becomes slick then it becomes sticky and clumps up around any surface that comes in contact with it. The sticky nature of the mud is because the clay has a high bentonite content. The Missouri Breaks are notorious for this sticky \\"gumbo mud\\". Travelers to Rocky Point in wet weather encountered this mud. It was exhausting to travel through. Charley Siringo a famous stock detective rode horseback to Rocky Point on his favorite mare, intending to cross the Missouri River, on his way from Lewistown to Landusky in the Little Rocky Mountains. After Siringo had started into the Missouri Breaks (which he refers to as the \\"Bad Lands\\"), he encountered the \\"sticky mud\\" of the Missouri Breaks: > ... the sticky mud of the 'Bad Lands' was something fearful. It would stick > to the mare's feet till the poor animal could hardly gallop. I had seen many > kinds of sticky mud in my life, but nothing to equal this\\"Siringo, Charles > A., A Cowboy Detective: A True Story of Twenty-two Years With A World-Famous > Detective Agency, W.B. Conkey Company, 1912, p. 327. When Siringo dismounted, > \\"I found I couldn't get my foot in the stirrup, owing to the mud that was > stuck fast to it. Here my early cowboy training in the art of fancy swearing > came in play, as it seemed to relieve my mind, while the mud was being > scraped off my foot with a knife.\\" When he finally got to Rocky Point Siringo's mare was exhausted. > \\"My mare had only traveled 30 miles, but she had carried about 75 pounds of > mud across the 'Bad Lands,' hence she was almost played out on arriving at > Rocky Point. I had often heard of the 'Bad lands' and wanted to visit them, > but now that desire had vanished.\\" Settlement in Montana Territory In the Missouri Riber Breaks a ferry and a place to cross stock over the Missouri River were rare, and a community grew up at Rocky Point. Rocky Point became a meeting place and center of trade for miners, woodhawks, trappers, buffalo hunters, whiskey traders, ranchers and cowboys. Rocky Point served legitimate local businessmen and ranchers, but also became a place where thieves and outlaws lived. In 1880, C.A. Broadwater, Helena merchant and entrepreneur, moved his warehouse upriver from Carroll landing to the vicinity of Rocky Point. He erected buildings and named the settlement Wilder after Amherst H. Wilder, his business associate from St. Paul, Minnesota. Broadwater received shipments being forwarded to Ft. Maginnis. He requested military aid and a detachment of 19 men was sent Wilder in order to guard government freight until it was shipped to Ft. Maginnis. In 1885, Rocky Point had grown to one store, one hotel, one feed stable, two saloons, a blacksmith shop and the ferry run by Jimmy Taylor. The store was run by R.A. Richie and a warehouse 40 ft. x 90 ft. was run by M.F. Marsh who also ran his bar and hotel. Teddy Blue Abbott, a cowboy who later became a ranch owner and who wrote a book about his life had these observations about Rocky Point in the 1880s. > \\"There were a few stores at Rocky Point, and a saloon run by a man named > Marsh, and three white women. One was Mrs. Marsh, a very nice lady who kept > the eating house. She had a daughter. And there was also a woman they called > Big Ox, who was one of those haybags that used to follow the buffalo camps. > They had the damnedest names, those big old fat buffalo women. ... We was in > a wilderness and we had to make the best of it. As for Big Ox, I have heard > men say that when a man is starving he would eat crumbs and worse than > crumbs.\\"Abott, E.C., and Smith Helena Huntington, We Pointed Them North, > Recollections of a Cowpuncher, University of Oklahoma Press, 1954, , p. 121. Refuge and gathering place for outlaws and rustlers in the early 1880s In the 1870s Rocky Point lay in the heart of the Missouri Breaks where extensive badlands run along the Missouri River for hundreds of miles. This area lay on the margins of several territorial counties and was thus remote from any county seat. The appearance of a county sheriff or his deputy in the breaks was a rare event, and the presence of law enforcement was nonexistent. Persons in trouble with the law gathered at Rocky Point because it provided a refuge that was remote from interference by law officers.Stuart, Granville, Pioneering In Montana, University of Nebraska Press, 1977, , p. 198. If the Sheriff of one county showed up, the outlaws could saddle up and swim their mounts across the Missouri, and be in another county beyond the sheriff's jurisdiction and thus beyond the risk of arrest. The outlaws resided in the river bottoms and masqueraded as buffalo hunters, Indian traders or wood hawks. Rocky Point in the 1870s and 1880s was well known to be a tough town. Extending out from the Missouri Breaks, both to the north and south, were the vast grasslands of the Eastern Montana prairies. In the early 1880s the buffalo on these ranges were hunted to near extinction, and were replaced by large herds of cattle, most trailed up from Texas. Large ranches developed, based on a deeded \\"homeplace\\" located along water courses, but grazing cattle on adjacent broad stretches of public lands, referred to as \\"open range\\". These ranches kept large herds of horses. This environment provided an opportunity for thieves residing in the breaks‚Äîthey rustled stock from herds on the plains on one side of the Missouri River, drove them into remote reaches of the breaks, changed their brands, and then drove the stock to the other side of the river, to reach communities where the stock could be sold. Rustling horses was most common because horses could be driven much faster than cattle. Rocky Point was associated with this system of rustling because stolen stock could be crossed from one side of the river to the other at the Rocky Point Ford. The thieves would range south as far as Wyoming, and north as far as Canada. As the incidents of horse stealing became more and more common in the area, the consensus of the surrounding ranching community was: \\"There were rustlers' rendezvous at the mouth of the Musselshell, at Rocky Point and at Wolf Point [in Montana Territory]\\". Vigilantes visit in 1884 In 1884 Granville Stuart, an early pioneer and rancher (operator-owner of the large DHS ranch located south of the breaks near Fort Maginnis) organized a strike force that went into the breaks, seeking out and summarily hanging (or shooting it out with) suspected rustlers. Estimates of rustler casualties ran from a low of 13 to a high of 35, but probably were closer to 18 or 20. Rocky Point was visited by the vigilantes in 1884. > \\"At the time the vigilante committee started for the mouth of the > Musselshell, another party left for the vicinity of Rocky Point where two > notorious horse thieves, known as Red Mike and Brocky Gallagher, were making > their headquarters. They had stolen about thirty head of horses from Smith > river, changed the brands and were holding them in the bad lands ... When > the vigilantes arrived at Rocky Point the men were not there but had crossed > over to the north side of the river. The party followed after, and captured > them and recovered some of the horses. Both men pled guilty to horse > stealing and told their captors that there were six head of the stolen > horses at Dutch Louie's ranch on Crooked Creek.Stuart, Granville, Pioneering > In Montana, University of Nebraska Press, 1977, , p. 206. Both Red Mike and Brocky Gallagher were hung by the vigilantes. As a result of the vigilantes' attentions, rustling declined in the breaks. Acquisition of the alternative name of Wilder, Montana, and continuation into the 20th century The end of the Missouri River steamboat era came with the completion across Montana of the Northern Pacific Railroad line in 1883, followed by the construction into Montana of the Great Northern Railroad line in 1887. Rocky Point was still a crossing point on the Missouri, but it was not located between any major towns and only attracted limited traffic. In 1886 a post office was created in the Rocky Point area, and given the name of Wilder, which name originated with C. A. Broadwater (see above). The Wilder post office operated from 1886 to 1939. Robert A. Richie became the first postmaster. In 1888 Welter S. Collins was postmaster. In 1889 Philander D. Freese was postmaster at Wilder. Fredrick J. Bourdon then became postmaster and in 1895 A. L. Monroe took the job. Three months later James Tyler became the postmaster. After the creation of the post office, the general community at the crossing point on the Missouri was still known as Rocky Point, but the post office was known as Wilder, and sometimes the community was also referred to as Wilder. As long as the ferry functioned, Rocky Point remained a local gathering place. It became a polling place for elections. During the election of 1878 there was a polling place at Rocky Point. In 1886 there were 53 votes in the election and the judges were: Richie, the postmaster, Tyler, a store owner and ferry operator, and Pike Landusky, a miner and bar owner and generally colorful character. In 1888, Marsh's saloon at the Rocky Point ford burned down and he rented a building from E. C. Bartlett. R.A. Richie moved away to Glasgow where he died of typhoid fever. In 1889 Montana became a state. At that time Rocky Point was in Choteau County, but all of Choteau County south of the Missouri River was traded off to Fergus County for $2500 and Wilder became part of Fergus County. In 1900, Rocky Point still remained a river crossing with a ferry, an operating store and bar to serve the area. Tex Alford ran a saloon across the river. After 1900 homesteaders began to arrive in greater numbers on the Eastern Montana prairie. In 1905 Margaret Frost was the postmaster at Wilder. In 1907 Elmer Turner took over the store at Rocky Point and the Wilder post office. He also bought the ferry at the Rocky Point crossing from Tyler. Turner homesteaded and lived at the ford until 1935 when the government purchased all the land in the Missouri valley for the Fort Peck Dam. In 1918 the Wilder Post Office was moved from the area close to the ford, to Luella M. Belyea's homestead on top of the river hill. Mr. Elmer Turner maintained the ferry at Rocky Point/Wilder until the winter of 1929 when he used the lumber to roof a new log shop and in another building which still stands. Elma M. Webb took over the Wilder post office on 4 November 1920. The original handmade boxes, counter and shelves from the river were installed in her home where she also ran a store. During Elma Webb's tenure from 1920 to 1935, the mail came from Roy on Monday and Friday of each week. After the ferry was dismantled in 1929, Rocky Point ford ceased to function either as a ferry or a community, but the concept of community continued at the Wilder Post Office, though no longer at the site of the original ford. Local people continued to congregate at the Wilder Post Office and store in the home of Elma Webb. Wilder was voting precinct #30 and was a polling place from its origin until 1942 when the last election was held at the Little Crooked School house with John Mauland, Edith McNulty and Ray McNulty as judges. Upon the death of her husband, Elma Webb leased her place to Elna Brumfield Wright and turned the Wilder Post Office over to her on 15 December 1935. Elna put the store/post office charge of her brother-in-law, Stanley Wright, on 4 June 1936. Bertine Mathison leased the Webb place and became postmaster in 1937. Fire destroyed the building and the Wilder Post Office was discontinued 30 November 1939, which also spelled the end of Wilder as a successor to Rocky Point. Consideration as a site for a highway bridge in 1931 In 1931 Rocky Point was considered as a site for bridge over the Missouri River to connect a north-south highway which was projected to be built through the Missouri Breaks to connect Lewistown (south of the breaks) and Malta Montana (north of the breaks). The positive features of Rocky Point bridge site were # a good foundation in the Bearpaw Shale at the site, and # the river channel was not prone to wander at this place. In addition, in comparison to other sites, Rocky Point had a lower estimated price for both the bridge and for the approach roads through the breaks. However, before the Montana legislature could take action, the 1930s depression caused all road building plans to be placed on hold.Axline, Jon, Conveniences Sorely Needed: Montana's Historic Highway Bridges, 1860-1956, Montana Historical Society Press, 2005, p. 119. By the time interest in the highway project revived in the 1950s Rocky Point was passed over in favor of another location upstream where the bridge was eventually built. Absorption into the Ft. Peck Dam project in 1935 In 1936 the land at site of Rocky Point became the property of the U.S. government when the Army Corps of Engineers condemned and bought up all the river bottom land that might possibly be affected by Ft Peck Dam, then being built. This ended all community activity at the site of the river ford at Rocky Point. All the families who had lived on the ranches and homesteads along the Missouri River moved away. The lands at the Rocky Point ford have remained in federal control since that time. They are now part of the Charles A. Russell Wildlife Refuge operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Several historic structures still exist down along the Missouri near the site of the Missouri River ford. They are in deteriorating condition. Field trip Approach roads and site are on public lands in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge is easily accessible on public roads. The coordinates and a \\"Google Earth\\" review, or utilization of a DeLorme atlas of maps will provide directions from U.S. Highway 191 to Rocky Point. Off the highway, roads are mostly all \\"dirt\\". They are inaccessible when wet. Although the description by Charles Siringo quoted above of the difficulties with sticky mud in the breaks is over a hundred years old, it is still applicable. The website for the Charles M. Russell national Wildlife Refuge has downloadable maps, and provides information on \\"Current Refuge Road Conditions\\" on the home page, specifically noting impassable places, but warns that their list may not be complete or up to date.Charles M.

This species was first described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1852. He was an army surgeon who worked for 20 years for the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia, amassing a collection of over 12,000 fish which he took home with him when he returned to Holland. They are mostly lodged in the Natural History Museum in Leiden. Distribution and habitat The whitenose whipray is found in the eastern Indian Ocean and the western central Pacific Ocean, its range extending from India to Malaysia and Indonesia; it is a demersal fish and is usually found over soft substrates in water that is shallower than , including the lower reaches of rivers and estuaries. One individual was found in a saltwater lagoon. Uses The species is caught in large quantities by bottom trawling, demersal tangle netting, trammel netting, and Danish seine fishing in India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The flesh is consumed fresh or preserved by salting and drying, and the vertebrae are dried and exported to the Far East. The skins are dried and used in the manufacture of bags, wallets, belts, and shoes. Status This demersal whipray is threatened by overexploitation, as it is fished intensively over much of its range. In Indonesia, fishing vessels must travel for much greater distances to find acceptable quantities of fish. In India, too, where it is heavily fished, the catch rate is also declining from overfishing, as well as pollution and coastal degradation. Little is known of this fish's reproductive rate, but it is likely to be similar to other elasmobranchs.

The name is French for \\"smooth rope\\".  Description  Corde lisse moves are normally a combination of held postures and drops using a rope that hangs from the ceiling. These ropes are normally made from soft cotton about 30-35mm thick. The technique is closely related to both silks, (another aerial circus skill performed on one or two long strips of strong fabric, often in bright colours), and Spanish web. It requires great skill and strength. Performers do not have any kind of safety net or safety line, relying on their own strength and ability to prevent a fall. It is possible for two (or more) people to perform on the same rope, although more than two is rare. The performers can hang off each other or be at different heights on the rope. The most famous use of aerial circus skills such as these has been for the BBC's test-card. Cirque du Soleil also uses corde lisse, aerial silks and trapeze in some of their shows. There are many schools and circus centers that teach rope throughout the world.  Corde lisse skills  There is no single naming convention for the skills on a corde lisse.

The New York Times Before settling in its current location in 1955, the Studio moved regularly over an eight-year period: In January 1948, it was a dance studio on East 59th Street. In April of that year, a move to the CBS Building at 1697 Broadway, near 53rd Street, established some semblance of stability; the Studio would not move again until the summer of 1952. From that point, the old Theatre Guild rehearsal rooms on the top floor of the ANTA Theatre became home, as they would remain until October 1954, when theatre renovations reduced the Studio to renting space twice a week. This it did at the Malin Studios at 1545 Broadway, room 610. This arrangement continued throughout the 1954‚Äì1955 theatrical season, even as the Studio was acquiring and renovating its current venue. In 1955 it moved to its current location in the former West 44th Street United Presbyterian Church, a Greek Revival structure which was built for the Seventh Associate Presbyterian Church in 1858 or 1859. It was one of the last churches to be built in that style in New York City. Graduate drama school From September 1994 through May 2005, the Studio collaborated with The New School in the education of master‚Äôs-level theatre students at the Actors Studio Drama School (ASDS). After ending its contract with The New School, the Actors Studio established The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in 2006.

King George was described variously as a square-rigged ship and a three-masted schooner, known in America during the later 19th century as a \\"tern\\". The confusion is due to her being modeled on the Baltimore-built three-masted schooners that had sail plans which resembled the square-rigged ships. These ships came into use in the later half of the 18th century,Chapelle, Howard I., The search for speed under sail, 1700-1855, Bonanza, New York, 1967, pp.169-170 and would have been known to James Underwood, the shipyard builder. Their distinctive sail plan feature was in having the extremely large fore and main courses, and only the fore and main topsails, with the mizzen mast rigged with the mainsail and main-topsail in place of the spanker, a plan based on the two-masted Boston pilot schooner that eventually evolved into the famed Baltimore clippers in the 1830s.Building the Baltimore Pilot Schooner Arrow, Michael Higgins The fore and staysail booms were omitted to allow stowage of extra whaling boats and other equipment. James Underwood undertook to build the ship with Messrs. Kable and Co. as partners and using a bond of ¬£2,000 from Simeon Lord, a prominent colonial personality. One difficulty in securing permission to build the ship was due to the proclamation by Governor King of disallowing the building of any ship that could compete with the East India Company's trade in the Asian waters. Later Lord would try to get around the provisions by asking permission to send King George to Fiji for sandalwood, and then to China for \\"a cargo\\".G. J.

The games have drawn comparison to the Professor Layton series, which is also published by Level-5. A third branch of the series, entitled Mystery Room, was also planned, but the title was ultimately rebranded as a spin-off of the Professor Layton series, entitled Layton Brothers: Mystery Room. Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino stated in 2008 that more Atamania titles were under consideration, but aside from Mystery Room, none have since been announced. Sur≈çn to Makuhƒìru no Nazo no Sut≈çrƒ´ In , the player is tasked with solving lateral thinking puzzles, a type of puzzle created by authors Paul Sloane and Des MacHale. In lateral thinking puzzles, the player is given bare details about a strange circumstance, and the goal is to deduce what happened through a series of yes‚Äìno questions. For example, a girl takes an umbrella to school, knowing it was sunny outside. A player would then be asked why she would do such a thing, and be given the option of asking yes‚Äìno questions to figure out the answer. The player might then ask whether or not it rained the day before, and, if that were the case, eventually conclude that she was returning an umbrella that she had borrowed the day prior. In Nazo no Monogatari, the player is capable of asking questions by connecting two words or phrases, causing a question to automatically be generated from them. In order to solve a puzzle, the player is asked to complete a multiple-choice quiz with many possible answers in order to ensure that they have found the correct solution to the mystery. Nazo no Sut≈çrƒ´ sold 144,000 units within the first month of its release on May 21, 2009; it would receive a sequel the same year on September 3, entitled . Nazo no Sut≈çrƒ´ 2 introduced a \\"mystery challenge\\" mode, which adds new challenges to the game as a player progresses through the game's story mode.

Tago Akira no Atama no Tais≈ç Tago Akira no Atama no Tais≈ç is based on a series of puzzle books of the same name written by Akira Tago, who has taken part in the development of puzzles in both this series and the Professor Layton series. In Atama no Tais≈ç, the player reads through storybooks based on Akira Tago's puzzle books, and is presented with puzzles to solve at their leisure. If a player is not able to solve a puzzle in the game, they have the option of revealing the answer to the puzzle. There were four Atama no Tais≈ç games released, in sets of two. The first set was released in Japan on June 18, 2009. It consisted of and . The second pair was released on October 8, 2009; it consisted of and .

The series has sold comparatively poorly: the first episode was the seventh best-selling game on Japan on the week of its release at 10,000 units, charting below Nazo no Monogatari despite the latter having been released several weeks earlier. Mystery Room At the company's annual conference in 2009, Level-5 announced a third branch of the series, entitled Mystery Room. In Mystery Room, the player would follow the lives of Poccho and Sly, two genius detectives in the fictional Brewster Detective Agency, the top-rated agency in the United States. The two worked in the \\"Final Investigation Room\\", and would solve crimes based solely on information they have gathered from other detectives. The game was to be played by selecting a crime from a list of options, and then using the touch screen of the Nintendo DS to examine materials. The game was originally planned to release in 2010, but the title was not released and all but its trailer was removed at the last moment from Level-5's 2010 presentation at the Tokyo Game Show. The title was later given a \\"Spring 2011\\" release date, but it would again be delayed indefinitely to \\"deliver a product of desired quality.\\". Mystery Room appeared again at Level-5's annual conference in October 2011, where it was announced that the Nintendo DS version of the game had been cancelled, and the title had been ported to Apple's iOS, where it would be released as Layton Brothers: Mystery Room, a spin-off of the Professor Layton series featuring the son of Professor Hershel Layton.

Hervanta in Tampere, Finland is mostly known its residential tower blocks, but there are also some commercial services. A commuter town is a populated area that is primarily residential, rather than commercial or industrial. People who live in commuter towns usually work in other places. Routine travel from home to work and then from work to home is called commuting, which is where the term comes from. A commuter town may be called by many other terms: \\"bedroom community\\" (Canada and northeastern US), \\"bedroom town\\", \\"bedroom suburb\\" (US), \\"dormitory town\\", \\"dormitory suburb\\", or, less commonly, \\"dormitory village\\" (Britain/Commonwealth/Ireland). In Japan, a commuter town may be referred to with the wasei-eigo coinage . The term \\"exurb\\" was also used starting in the 1950s for a commuter town, but especially since 2006, is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built than the suburbs to which the exurbs' residents commute. Commuter towns have been widely studied in numerous studies and found to contribute to stress, waste of productivity and detrimental to overall well-being of society.  Distinction between suburbs and commuter towns  Camarillo, California, a typical U.S. bedroom community made up almost entirely of homes, schools and retail outlets Suburbs and commuter towns often coincide, but are not synonymous. Similar to college town, resort town and mill town, the term commuter town describes the municipality's predominant economic function. A suburb, in contrast, is a community of lesser size, density, political power and/or commerce comparative to a nearby community that is usually of greater economic importance. A town's economic function may change, for example when improved transport brings commuters to industrial suburbs or railway towns in search of suburban living. Some suburbs, for example Teterboro, New Jersey and Emeryville, California, remained industrial when they became surrounded by commuter towns; many commuters work in such industrial suburbs but few reside in them; hence, they are not commuter towns. As a general rule, suburbs are developed in areas adjacent to a main employment center, such as a town or a city, but may or may not have many jobs locally, whereas bedroom communities have few local businesses, and most residents who have jobs commute to employment centers some distance away. Commuter towns may be in rural or semi-rural areas, with a ring of green space separating them from the larger city or town. Where urban sprawl and conurbation have erased clear lines among towns and cities in large metropolitan areas, this is not the case.  Causes  Commuter towns can arise for a number of different reasons. Sometimes, as in Sleepy Hollow, New York or Tiburon, California, a town loses its main source of employment, leaving its residents to seek work elsewhere. In other cases, a pleasant small town, such as Warwick, New York, over time attracts more residents but not large businesses to employ them, requiring denizens to commute to employment centers. Another cause, particularly relevant in the American South and West, is the rapid growth of small cities. The earlier creation of the Interstate Highway System was one cause of the greatest growth was seen by the sprawling metropolitan areas of those cities. As a result, many small cities were absorbed into the suburbs of the larger cities. Often, however, commuter towns form when workers in a region cannot afford to live where they work and must seek residency in another town with a lower cost of living. The late 20th century dot-com bubble and United States housing bubble drove housing costs in Californian metropolitan areas to historic highs, spawning exurban growth in adjacent counties. For example, most cities in western Riverside County, California can be considered exurbs of Orange County, California and Los Angeles County, California. , over 80% of the workforce of Tracy, California was employed in the San Francisco Bay Area. A related phenomenon is common in the resort towns of the American West that require large workforces, yet emphasize building larger single-family residences and other expensive housing. For example, the resort town of Jackson, Wyoming has spawned several nearby bedroom communities, including Victor, Idaho, Driggs, Idaho, and Alpine, Wyoming, where the majority of the Jackson workforce resides. On Long Island, New York, many of the workforce who serve The Hamptons also reside in communities more modest and more suburban than their workplace, giving rise to a daily reverse commuter flow from more dense to less dense areas. In certain major European cities, such as Berlin and London, commuter towns were founded in response to bomb damage sustained during World War II. Residents were relocated to semi-rural areas within a radius, firstly because much inner city housing had been destroyed, and secondly in order to stimulate development away from cities as the industrial infrastructure shifted from rail to road. Around London, several towns ‚Äì such as Basildon, Crawley, Harlow, and Stevenage ‚Äì were built for this purpose by the Commission for New Towns. In some cases, commuter towns can result from negative economic conditions. Steubenville, Ohio, for instance, had its own regional identity along with neighboring Weirton, West Virginia until the collapse of the steel industry in the 1980s. Combined with easier access to the much larger city of Pittsburgh via the Steubenville Pike and the Parkway West, Steubenville has shifted its marketing efforts to being a commuter town to Pittsburgh, as well as one with a lower cost of living in Ohio compared to tax-heavy Pennsylvania. In 2013, Jefferson County, Ohio (where Steubenville is located) was added to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area as part of its larger Combined Statistical Area.  Effects  Where commuters are wealthier and small town housing markets weaker than city housing markets, the development of a bedroom community may raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a process akin to gentrification. Long-time residents may be displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This can also be influenced by zoning restrictions in urbanized areas that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to places of employment. The number of commuter towns increased in the US and the UK during the 20th century because of a trend for people to move out of the cities into the surrounding green belt. Historically, commuter towns were developed by railway companies to create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of development was the Metropolitan Railway (now part of London Underground) which marketed its Metro-land developments. This initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city London to suburbs such as Harrow and out of London itself, to commuter villages in Buckinghamshire or Hertfordshire. Commuter towns have more recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure, thus spurring the development of roads and public transportation systems. These can take the form of light rail lines extending from the city centre to new streetcar suburbs and new or expanded highways, whose construction and traffic can lead to the community becoming part of a larger conurbation. In the United States, it is common for commuter towns to create disparities in municipal tax rates. When a commuter town collects few business taxes, residents must pay the brunt of the public operating budget in higher property or income taxes. Such municipalities may scramble to encourage commercial growth once an established residential base has been reached. A 2014 study by the British Office for National Statistics found that commuting also affects wellbeing. Commuters are more likely to be anxious, dissatisfied and have the sense that their daily activities lack meaning than those who don't have to travel to work even if they are paid more. In Belgium, the development of traditional rural Flemish towns surrounding Brussels into commuter towns is causing major language tensions, as most of the newcoming commuters are French-speaking or even international English-speaking families with no attachment to the Flemish roots. The Flemish movement in the Brussels- Halle-Vilvoorde area, with demands such as the strict enforcement of the Dutch language (restaurants with bilingual menus have been assaulted by activists, etc.)  Exurbs  The term \\"exurb\\" was also used in the United States and elsewhere, starting in 1955 for a commuter town, as the word exurb ( a portmanteau of \\"extra & urban\\") was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book The Exurbanites, to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the suburbs that are commuter towns for an urban area. However, especially since a landmark report by the Brookings Institution in 2006, the term is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built than the suburbs to which the exurbs' residents commute. Exurbs vary in wealth and education level. In the United States, exurban areas typically have much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, though this is not necessarily the case in other countries. They also typically have average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties, and some have some of the highest median household incomes in their respective metropolitan area. However, depending on local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than suburbs nearer the city. = Then and now = Commuters from early exurbs, such as the end of Philadelphia's Main Line and the Northern Westchester region of Westchester County, New York, reached the city center via commuter rail and parkway systems. Today's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise lightly developed areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural, wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs. Exurbs may have originated independently of the major city to which many residents commute. Most consist almost exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs were organized on the principles of the garden city movement. Yesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as Forest Hills and Garden City, New York, often become a later decade's suburbs, surrounded and absorbed into a belt of infill. = Planning = Many suburbs within a metropolitan city proper enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period, after which growth slowed for several decades; however, since the 1990s extensive development has occurred outside of cities. There have also been significant growth differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many developments typical of exurbs, such as the proliferation of big box retailers, lie just on the outside, due to older suburbs' being restricted by inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are free to develop and grow. Some architects, environmentalists, and urban planners consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted planning. Comparatively low density towns - often featuring large lots and large homes - create heavy motor vehicle dependency. Others argue that exurban environments, such as those that have emerged in Oregon over the last 40 years as a result of the state's unique land use laws, have helped to protect local agriculture and local businesses by creating strict urban growth boundaries that encourage greater population densities in centralized towns, while slowing or greatly reducing urban and suburban sprawl into agricultural, timber land, and natural areas.

They are important animal models for studying the role of genes which have been sequenced but whose functions have not been determined. By causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse, and observing any differences from normal behaviour or physiology, researchers can infer its probable function. Mice are currently the laboratory animal species most closely related to humans for which the knockout technique can easily be applied. They are widely used in knockout experiments, especially those investigating genetic questions that relate to human physiology. Gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only been possible since 2003. The first recorded knockout mouse was created by Mario R. Capecchi, Martin Evans, and Oliver Smithies in 1989, for which they were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Aspects of the technology for generating knockout mice, and the mice themselves have been patented in many countries by private companies.  Use  A laboratory mouse in which a gene affecting hair growth has been knocked out (left), is shown next to a normal lab mouse. Knocking out the activity of a gene provides information about what that gene normally does. Humans share many genes with mice. Consequently, observing the characteristics of knockout mice gives researchers information that can be used to better understand how a similar gene may cause or contribute to disease in humans. Examples of research in which knockout mice have been useful include studying and modeling different kinds of cancer, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, substance abuse, anxiety, aging and Parkinson's disease. Knockout mice also offer a biological and scientific context in which drugs and other therapies can be developed and tested. Millions of knockout mice are used in experiments each year.  Strains  A knockout mouse (left) that is a model for obesity, compared with a normal mouse. There are several thousand different strains of knockout mice. Many mouse models are named after the gene that has been inactivated. For example, the p53 knockout mouse is named after the p53 gene which codes for a protein that normally suppresses the growth of tumours by arresting cell division and/or inducing apoptosis. Humans born with mutations that deactivate the p53 gene suffer from Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a condition that dramatically increases the risk of developing bone cancers, breast cancer and blood cancers at an early age. Other mouse models are named according to their physical characteristics or behaviours.  Procedure  The procedure for making mixed- genotype blastocyst. Breeding scheme for producing knockout mice. Blastocysts containing cells, that are both wildtype and knockout cells, are injected into the uterus of a foster mother. This produces offspring that are either wildtype and coloured the same colour as the blastocyst donor (grey) or chimera (mixed) and partially knocked out. The chimera mice are crossed with a normal wildtype mouse (grey). This produces offspring that are either white and heterozygous for the knocked out gene or grey and wildtype. White heterozygous mice can subsequently be crossed to produce mice that are homozygous for the knocked out gene. There are several variations to the procedure of producing knockout mice; the following is a typical example. #The gene to be knocked out is isolated from a mouse gene library. Then a new DNA sequence is engineered which is very similar to the original gene and its immediate neighbour sequence, except that it is changed sufficiently to make the gene inoperable. Usually, the new sequence is also given a marker gene, a gene that normal mice don't have and that confers resistance to a certain toxic agent (e.g., neomycin) or that produces an observable change (e.g. colour or fluorescence). In addition, a second gene, such as herpes tk+, is also included in the construct in order to accomplish a complete selection. #Embryonic stem cells are isolated from a mouse blastocyst (a very young embryo) and grown in vitro. For this example, we will take stem cells from a white mouse. #The new sequence from step 1 is introduced into the stem cells from step 2 by electroporation. By the natural process of homologous recombination some of the electroporated stem cells will incorporate the new sequence with the knocked-out gene into their chromosomes in place of the original gene. The chances of a successful recombination event are relatively low, so the majority of altered cells will have the new sequence in only one of the two relevant chromosomes ‚Äì they are said to be heterozygous. Cells that were transformed with a vector containing the neomycin resistance gene and the herpes tk+ gene are grown in a solution containing neomycin and Ganciclovir in order to select for the transformations that occurred via homologous recombination. Any insertion of DNA that occurred via random insertion will die because they test positive for both the neomycin resistance gene and the herpes tk+ gene, whose gene product reacts with Ganciclovir to produce a deadly toxin. Moreover, cells that do not integrate any of the genetic material test negative for both genes and therefore die as a result of poisoning with neomycin. #The embryonic stem cells that incorporated the knocked-out gene are isolated from the unaltered cells using the marker gene from step 1. For example, the unaltered cells can be killed using a toxic agent to which the altered cells are resistant. #The knocked-out embryonic stem cells from step 4 are inserted into a mouse blastocyst. For this example, we use blastocysts from a grey mouse. The blastocysts now contain two types of stem cells: the original ones (from the grey mouse), and the knocked-out cells (from the white mouse). These blastocysts are then implanted into the uterus of female mice, where they develop. The newborn mice will therefore be chimeras: some parts of their bodies result from the original stem cells, other parts from the knocked-out stem cells. Their fur will show patches of white and grey, with white patches derived from the knocked-out stem cells and grey patches from the recipient blastocyst. #Some of the newborn chimera mice will have gonads derived from knocked-out stem cells, and will therefore produce eggs or sperm containing the knocked-out gene. When these chimera mice are crossbred with others of the wild type, some of their offspring will have one copy of the knocked-out gene in all their cells. These mice will be entirely white and are not chimeras, however they are still heterozygous. #When these heterozygous offspring are interbred, some of their offspring will inherit the knocked-out gene from both parents; they carry no functional copy of the original unaltered gene (i.e. they are homozygous for that allele). A detailed explanation of how knockout (KO) mice are created is located at the website of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2007.  Limitations  The National Institutes of Health discusses some important limitations of this technique. > While knockout mouse technology represents a valuable research tool, some > important limitations exist. About 15 percent of gene knockouts are > developmentally lethal, which means that the genetically altered embryos > cannot grow into adult mice. This problem is often overcome through the use > of conditional mutations. The lack of adult mice limits studies to embryonic > development and often makes it more difficult to determine a gene's function > in relation to human health. In some instances, the gene may serve a > different function in adults than in developing embryos. > Knocking out a gene also may fail to produce an observable change in a mouse > or may even produce different characteristics from those observed in humans > in which the same gene is inactivated. For example, mutations in the p53 > gene are associated with more than half of human cancers and often lead to > tumours in a particular set of tissues. However, when the p53 gene is > knocked out in mice, the animals develop tumours in a different array of > tissues. There is variability in the whole procedure depending largely on the strain from which the stem cells have been derived. Generally cells derived from strain 129 are used. This specific strain is not suitable for many experiments (e.g., behavioural), so it is very common to backcross the offspring to other strains. Some genomic loci have been proven very difficult to knock out. Reasons might be the presence of repetitive sequences, extensive DNA methylation, or heterochromatin. The confounding presence of neighbouring 129 genes on the knockout segment of genetic material has been dubbed the \\"flanking-gene effect\\". Methods and guidelines to deal with this problem have been proposed. Another limitation is that conventional (i.e. non-conditional) knockout mice develop in the absence of the gene being investigated. At times, loss of activity during development may mask the role of the gene in the adult state, especially if the gene is involved in numerous processes spanning development. Conditional/inducible mutation approaches are then required that first allow the mouse to develop and mature normally prior to ablation of the gene of interest. Another serious limitation is a lack of evolutive adaptations in knockout model that might occur in wild type animals after they naturally mutate. For instance, erythrocyte-specific coexpression of GLUT1 with stomatin constitutes a compensatory mechanism in mammals that are unable to synthesize vitamin C.

Lenovo's tablet offerings are available in both ThinkPad and IdeaPad variants. While the ThinkPad Tablets are designed for business, the IdeaPad tablets, like the laptops of the same name, are meant for home and personal use. These tablets are different from Lenovo‚Äôs X Series tablets, which are laptop/tablet hybrids and which use Microsoft Windows as their operating system. Description Released in August 2011, the ThinkPad Tablet is the first in Lenovo‚Äôs line of business-oriented Tablets with the ThinkPad brand. The tablet has been described by Gadget Mix as a premium business tablet. Since the Tablet is primarily business-oriented, it includes features for security, such as anti-theft software, the ability to remotely disable the tablet, SD card encryption, layered data encryption, and Cisco Virtual Private Network (VPN). Additionally, the ThinkPad Tablet is able to run software such as IBM's Lotus Notes Traveler. The stylus could be used to write notes on the Tablet, which also included software to convert this handwritten content to text. Another feature on the Tablet was a drag-and-drop utility designed to take advantage of the Tablet's touch capabilities. This feature could be used to transfer data between USB devices, internal storage, or an SD card. Slashgear summarized the ThinkPad Tablet by saying, \\"The stylus and the styling add up to a distinctive slate that doesn‚Äôt merely attempt to ape Apple‚Äôs iPad.\\" The ThinkPad Tablet was discontinued upon the launch of the Windows 8-based ThinkPad Tablet 2 in October 2012. At the same time, Lenovo discontinued the use of Android on its ThinkPad-branded tablets; subsequent models, beginning with the Tablet 2, have exclusively used Windows as their operating system. Design and Development David Hill of Lenovo said he believed the ThinkPad Tablet to be \\"the weapon of choice for business success\\". In his article on the development of the Tablet, he indicated that every design detail was subjected to multiple design reviews, including basic elements such as the placement of the logo. =Digitizer pen= A challenge was indicated to be designing and integrating a digitizer pen into the Tablet, which already had a \\"crowded interior\\". This required a study of pen barrel diameter and the balancing of batteries, digitizer technology components, ergonomics, and storage space constraints for the pen itself. Additionally, dowel rods were used for diameter studies and sharpened pencils were used to study the appropriate length with users. The final pen developed based on this was 120 mm long. Lenovo ThinkPad 1 Pen =Folio keyboard= The ThinkPad Tablet was launched with an optional, dedicated . The folio offered a Lenovo keyboard and an optical trackpoint. The presence of this folio was appreciated by PC World as well, with the reviewer calling the folio the Tablet‚Äôs best feature. The folio was designed to offer users of the ThinkPad Tablet a typing experience similar to that of a ThinkPad laptop, as well as cursor control. The full-size keyboard on the folio reputedly offered users the same typing experience as that of the ThinkPad X1. Using a standard strain gauge based TrackPoint would have increased the folio thickness, making it necessary for innovation in the implementation of cursor control. Optical sensor technology was chosen for this, providing capabilities for traditional TrackPoint placement as well as the familiarity of a Touchpad. =ThinkPad Tablet Dock= The ThinkPad tablet dock is useful to charge the tablet. It only supports the tablet in vertical mode. IBM ThinkPad Tablet dock On the back side there in audio outport port, microphone input port, a micro USB port and support for the Thinkpad 20V power adapter. On its side it has a full size USB port. IBM ThinkPad Tablet dock Security According to Lenovo, eight major security vulnerabilities typical for tablet devices have been addressed in the ThinkPad Tablet. These are: *Encryption: The ThinkPad Tablet's internal storage device and removable SD card are encrypted via functionality built into the Android OS used on the tablet. *Anti-malware: The ThinkPad Tablet offers McAfee anti-malware preloaded, with options to upgrade to a corporate managed anti-malware solution. *Data Leakage: Features on the Tablet allow the USB ports, SD card slot, camera and microphone to be disabled and controlled by an IT administrator. The Tablet is certified by Good Technology, which encrypts email as well and prevents email data from being copied from the Tablet. *User authentication: In addition to Android's support for a user-defined PIN password, the ThinkPad Tablet also includes the capacity to lock the Tablet using Active Directory credentials. *Application control: Lenovo offers preloaded images on the ThinkPad Tablet, allowing users to customize the applications on the Tablet. Additionally, IT departments can create customized App Shops to restrict the applications that can be downloaded and installed to the Tablet. The Tablet also included Citrix receiver, which allows businesses to host and run applications on their own servers. *Anti-theft and recovery: The ThinkPad Tablet includes Absolute Computrace with Persistence, allowing Tablet data to be remotely wiped in case of loss or theft. *Rooted device detection: The ThinkPad Tablet automatically detects if it has been rooted, sending a report to a company's IT department. This allows an IT department to determine if the Tablet should be retrieved from the user or if access to resources should be restricted. Business-grade features According to Matt Kohut, the ThinkPad Tablet is the industry's first business-class Tablet because Lenovo is \\"the only vendor who can provide a full suite of services to make our customers more productive and secure.\\" He substantiated this by discussing the warranty on the ThinkPad Tablet, ThinkPad Protection, custom 'images' and asset tags. The warranty on the ThinkPad Tablet was a standard one year which could be upgraded to three years. This was indicated as being different from other Tablet warranties, which were anywhere between 90 days and a maximum of two years. ThinkPad Protection was described as being a method to protect the Tablet against common accidents. Again, Matt Kohut claimed that accidental damage protection was not on offer by many leading Tablet vendors, even at additional cost. The custom image allowed businesses to deploy Tablets that adhere to company security policies and with company applications preloaded. Finally, custom asset tags were also available and designed to attach to the bottom of the Tablet. Specifications Buttons and ports on a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet The ThinkPad Tablet offered the following specifications: *Processor: NVIDIA Tegra 2 Dual-Core 1 GHz processor *Operating system: Android 3.1 (Upgradable to 4.0) *Display: 10.1 inch, 1280x800, 16:10, IPS, multitouch display screen *Weight: starting at 1.65 lbs *Battery life: up to 8 hours *Storage space: up to 64GB storage *Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G *Ports: USB 2.0, micro-USB, mini-HDMI *Speakers and Connectors: SD card reader, Mini-HDMI out, SIM card slot (on selected models), mic, headphone *Card reader: 3 in 1 *Camera: 2 megapixel (front), 5 megapixel (rear) *Additional features: accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor Reviews In its review, PC World listed the pros of the ThinkPad Tablet as the full size USB port and SD card slot, the optional keyboard portfolio carry case, and the digitizer pen. The cons were listed as the thickness (14mm) and the bland design. The Tablet was described as serving \\"both work and play with key security and manageability features\\". The Corning Gorilla glass display uses IPS (in-plane switching) technology and offers a 178-degree viewing angle. Locked bootloader Some models of this tablet came with a locked bootloader. This means if the Android software and Recovery Menu fails, the tablet will brick with a software error without a way to recovering it. The only solution Lenovo offers is to replace the motherboard of the tablet. Lenovo has explained that this happens because the tablet contains DRM protected software and Lenovo proprietary code on the Android image.Re: Thinkpad Tablet 1: Errors on Recovery Menu, forums.lenovo.com Hardware issues Users on different forums have reported that the following hardware components on this tablet are prone to failure: * The on/off switch.Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, forum.xda-developers.com * The micro-USB port.

Shanghai Jiao Tong University is a C9 League university and a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University. Name The word \\"Jiao Tong\\" (), formerly romanized as \\"Chiao Tung\\", means transportation or communication. It reflects the university's root ‚Äî it was founded by the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the late Qing dynasty. History In 1896, the Nanyang Public School () was founded in Shanghai by the imperial edict of the Guangxu Emperor, under the Business and Telegraphs Office of the Qing imperial government. Four schools were established: a normal school, a school of foreign studies, a middle school, and a high school. Sheng Xuanhuai, the mandarin who proposed the idea to the Guangxu Emperor, became the first president and is, along with missionary educator John Calvin Ferguson, regarded as the university's founder. The Ministry of Commerce assumed administration of the college in 1904, and in 1905 changed the college's name to Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry. In 1906, the college was placed under the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Its name was changed to Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. When the Republic of China was founded, the college was placed under the Ministry of Communications and its name was once again changed, this time to Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry. In 1918, the Republic of China government founded the School of Management. After a merger with two other colleges in 1920, the name changed to Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung. The college achieved world renown in the 1930s and was referred to as the \\"Eastern MIT\\". In 1938, the Ministry of Education assumed administration of the university and renamed it to National Chiao Tung University (), the name by which daughter institution National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, is known to this day. In 1943, the graduate school was founded. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, neither the Communist Party of China (CPC) nor the Kuomintang KMT trusted each other or were actively cooperating. After American-sponsored attempts to negotiate a coalition government failed in 1946, the Chinese Civil War resumed. The CPC defeated the Nationalists in 1949, forcing Chiang's government to retreat to Taiwan. During the evacuation, a part of the faculty and alumni was taken to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek, founding National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan in 1958. After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Chiao Tung lost its \\"National\\" appellation and became Chiao Tung University to reflect that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. In the 1950s, the pinyin romanization system was developed in Mainland China and Chiao Tung University changed its English name to Jiao Tong University. Shanghai Second Medical University was merged into Shanghai Jiao Tong University on July 18, 2005, under the name Medical School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Since the reform and opening-up policy in China, SJTU has grown substantially. It is comprises five campuses, including Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan, Qibao, and Fahua (Ê≥ïÂçé), taking up an area of about 3,225,833 square meters. In 2013, Fran√ßois Hollande inaugurated the SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology (SPEIT), an institution based on the French engineering education system. The four founding member universities are √âcole Polytechnique, ENSTA ParisTech, Mines ParisTech and T√©l√©com ParisTechOverview , SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology The university was also a producer of the Academic Ranking of World Universities until 2008.

Building of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Zihong Road Most buildings on campus were influenced by American architecture. The main gate, built in 1935, is of traditional Chinese style reflecting the University's earlier status as the \\"Imperial Polytechnic College\\". he main gate approaches were via a series of marble bridges, similar to, although smaller than, those built in front of Tiananmen. However, recent road expansions have demolished the river as well as most bridges. A copy of this famous gate scene has been built on the east of the Minhang campus. The construction of the campus never came to an end in the past century. Existing buildings: the Middle College building (built in 1898), the original library (built in 1919), the gymnasium (built in 1925), the administrative building (built in 1933), the Xinjian building (built in 1953), the new Upper College building (built in 1955), the second teaching building (built in 1960), Bao Zhaolong library (built in 1985) and Haoran high-tech building (built in 1996) were constructed one after another. The university's School of International Education is located here, where many international students take classes throughout the academic year (however, most international students who take degree courses are in Minhang campus). The campus still houses various scientific research institutions, State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, for instance, although most moved to the new campus since 1987. =Minhang Campus= The Siyuan Lake, Minhang Campus The Minhang campus is located in the Minhang District on the outskirts of metropolitan Shanghai. This young campus, which was founded in 1987, covers 2,822,903m2 once farmland. Zizhu Science Park, where Intel, ST Microelectronics, Microsoft, Sandisk, and other high- tech companies placed their research and development centers, south of this campus. Currently, most of the university's administrative and academic framework and the majority of undergraduate and graduate students are situated at this campus, and the campus has three libraries and seven dining halls. =South Chongqing Road Campus= It used to be the campus of Shanghai Second Medical University, which is located in the Luwan District of Shanghai. The Aurora University (Shanghai), a pre-eminent Catholic university in Shanghai, was located there before 1952. =Qibao Campus= In 1999, Shanghai Agricultural College was merged into SJTU. Its campus, located at 2678 Qixin Road (postcode 201101), became the Qibao Campus of SJTU. =Shangzhong Road Campus= In 2006, Shanghai Jiao Tong University sold this campus to Shanghai High School. =Fahuazhen Road Campus= This campus is where Jiao Tong's Antai College of Economics and Management and the School of Continuing Education are located. =Lingang Campus= This campus is located at No 3 Yinlian Rd in the Lingang area. Jiao Tong's China-UK Low Carbon College moved to this campus in Step. 2018.  Notable alumni  Today, associations organized by Jiao Tong's alumni can be found in the United States, Japan, European Union countries, Canada, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. They call themselves Jiao Tong (Jiaoda) people. The routine services of these alumni associations include: updating contact lists, holding conferences, conducting Sino-foreign cultural exchanges, and keeping contact with other alumni associations throughout the world. Students from SJTU have won top prizes in various competitions, including ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Electronics Design Contests. Famous alumni of SJTU or its predecessors include Jiang Zemin, James S.C. Chao Lu Dingyi, Ding Guangen, Wang Daohan, Qian Xuesen, Wu Wenjun, Zou Taofen, Mao Yisheng, Cai Er, Huang Yanpei, Shao Lizi, Wang An, David K. Cheng, Jimmy H. C. Lin and many more. More than 200 of the academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering are alumni of Jiao Tong University.

He had been company president for six months, and two weeks prior had been promoted to chief executive officer, when he exposed \\"one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese corporate history\\", according to The Wall Street Journal. Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, the board chairman, who had appointed Woodford to these positions, again assumed the title of CEO and president. The incident raised concern about the endurance of tobashi schemes, and the strength of corporate governance in Japan. Apparently irregular payments for acquisitions had resulted in very significant asset impairment charges in the company's accounts, and this was exposed in an article in the Japanese financial magazine FACTA and had come to Woodford's attention. Japanese press speculated on a connection to Yakuza (Japanese organised crime syndicates). Olympus defended itself against allegations of impropriety. Despite Olympus' denials, the matter quickly snowballed into a corporate corruption scandal over concealment (called tobashi) of more than 117.7 billion yen ($1.5 billion) of investment losses and other dubious fees and other payments dating back to the late 1980s and suspicion of covert payments to criminal organisations. On 26 October, Kikukawa was replaced by Shuichi Takayama as chairman, president, and CEO. On 8 November 2011, the company admitted that the company's accounting practice was \\"inappropriate\\" and that money had been used to cover losses on investments dating to the 1990s. The company blamed the inappropriate accounting on former president Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, auditor Hideo Yamada and executive vice-president Hisashi Mori. By 2012 the scandal had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75‚Äì80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported ¬£10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 per cent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base.  Background  Olympus Corporation, a major Japanese manufacturer of optical imaging, laboratory and medical equipment listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange had, according to its accounts for the year ended 31 March 2011, consolidated net sales of ¬•847.1 billion (US$10.6 billion) in the year, and total shareholders' equity of ¬•262.5 billion (US$3.3 billion). The group employs close to 40,000 people around the world. Its assets of ¬•1 trillion (US$13.3 billion) as at 31 March 2011 included ¬•175.5 billion (US$2.2 billion) of goodwill, an intangible asset. Under the leadership of Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, who became president in 2001, the company's revenues increased from ¬•467 billion to ¬•847 billion while the profits were a relatively constant ¬•35 billion. alt=white 3-storey building; in the foreground is a vertical blue banner with the Olympus logoDuring the 1980s, many Japanese corporations relied on investments to bolster dwindling profits, particularly in its exports which had been eroded by a strong yen. Toshiro Shimoyama, Olympus president from 1984 to 1993, admitted to the Nikkei industrial daily newspaper in 1986: \\"When the main business is struggling, we need to earn through zaitech\\" (meaning financial engineering). Olympus invested in financial derivatives and other risky investments to boost profits. However, Shimoyama said he \\"does not remember\\" any attempt to conceal losses (tobashi) during his tenure as president: \\"As president it wasn't the case where all financial reports would come to me, so I have no memory. During that time Masatoshi Kishimoto was the treasurer ... I wouldn't have heard financial details.\\" Kishimoto, Olympus president from 1993 to 2001, in turn denied involvement in concealing losses, and instead suggested possible implication of Hideo Yamada, whom he said he supervised poorly. In 1991 Olympus had to take losses of ¬•2.1 billion on the value of its investments after the investment bonanza ended. In June 1998, Olympus was subject of market rumours that it had suffered sizeable trading losses on derivatives which caused its shares to plunge by 11 per cent. The rumours were emphatically denied by Olympus, which subsequently announced record profits. In September 2011, Olympus announced that it had written off part of a ¬•45 billion investment in emerging market bonds. The company further disclosed during its interim results in October 1999, that it had lost nearly ¬•17 billion from interest rate and currency swaps. The company also reported that it had lost ¬•2.9 billion in the Princeton Economics International Ponzi scheme. According to Bloomberg, the annual report of Olympus Corporation for the year ended 31 March 2010 showed a ¬•15.5 billion ($201 million) prior period adjustment for \\"loss related to the purchase of preference shares from [an unnamed] third party\\"; goodwill on its balance sheet also increased by ¬•13.5 billion yen to account for the purchase. BusinessWeek noted that ratio of a company's debt relative to its equity ranks Olympus among the top 2 percent most highly geared of Japan's largest companies, while The Financial Times commented that its capital base ‚Äì an equity ratio in 2011 of below 14 percent ‚Äì is the weakest among its peer group. Olympus is the only Nikkei 225 constituent whose intangible assets ‚Äì principally goodwill of around ¬•168 billion ‚Äì exceeds net assets (¬•151 billion). = External growth = Having spent some US$4 billion during this period under the stewardship of Kikukawa, the company's aggressive strategy of external growth was not without criticism. According to an Olympus employee, the acquisitions process and funds movements were under the tight control of a small circle of executives in the 'Financial Affairs Group'. Japanese business daily is quoted as saying more than a hundred businesses were acquired during Kikukawa's tenure, and that the majority were unlisted and loss-making. The investments were in diverse sectors such as pet care and DVD production, and often had little connection with the core Olympus business. The most significant acquisition was the British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, acquired in 2008 at a cost of $2 billion ‚Äì the equivalent of almost 5 times turnover and 27 times EBITDA. In the same year, Olympus also paid out ¬•73.5 billion ($965 million) when it acquired three \\"small venture firms\\" ‚Äì Altis, Humalabo, and NewsChef. By contrast, in 2009 Olympus sold the profitable diagnostics unit it had built up over 40 years to Beckman Coulter for $1 billion ‚Äì approximately two times turnover ‚Äì to free up capital. Exposure of the scandal  =Woodford's background and inquiries= British-born Michael Woodford was an Olympus veteran of 30 years, and previously executive managing director of Olympus Medical Systems Europa. As European Director in 2008, Woodford had noticed the \\"strange goings-on at the company\\" such as the Gyrus acquisition, which should have been within his scope but was instead handled from Tokyo. (Woodford had set out to resign over the matter but stayed with Olympus after being reassured on the acquisition and being promoted to oversee Olympus' European businesses and appointed to the main Olympus board). However, on 30 July 2011, the matter surfaced again, when Woodford's attention as President was drawn by German colleagues to an article in Facta that alleged Olympus had made undisclosed payments for a series of acquisitions some of which were outside its \\"core\\" camera and endoscope business, most notably a sum of $687 million apparently paid to advisers as part of the Gyrus acquisition. Woodford said that he asked Hisashi Mori and some confidants about the Facta report, and stated also that at a lunch meeting in August with Kikukawa and Hisashi Mori, Olympus' compliance officer, Kikukawa revealed he ordered staff not to tell Woodford about the allegations because Woodford was \\"too busy\\" dealing with other matters. Kikukawa dismissed the article as \\"tabloid, sensationalist journalism\\". Upon learning about a second article referring to payments by Olympus to \\"anti-social forces\\", a euphemism for yakuza (Japanese criminal organisations), The Japan Times notes that from the start, Facta remained the lone Japanese journal to scoop the Olympus accounting irregularities until the scandal broke in Western media sources after Woodford exposed the matter. Woodford began to write a series of six letters to Mori and/or Kikukawa regarding his concerns as to governance issues \\"relating to the company's M&A; (acquisitions) activities\\". Woodford copied later letters to the company's auditors, and threatened to resign if he did not receive satisfactory responses about the 2008 Gyrus acquisition costs, and the goodwill impairment of around $600 million made that year for the other acquisitions. On 1 April 2011, Woodford was promoted to the post of president and chief operating officer, replacing Kikukawa and becoming the first ever non-Japanese chairman of Olympus. =Woodford's appointment as CEO = Six months after Woodford's appointment as COO and President, on 1 October, Olympus elevated him to its chief executive officer, stating that since his appointment as president/COO, \\"the Board have been extremely pleased with the progress made under Mr. Woodford's leadership in this role, which has exceeded the expectations at the time of his appointment.\\" At the time of Woodford's appointment, he was regarded as an unlikely choice. Reuters reports there were rumours that he only got the job because he would be \\"easy to control\\"; some Japanese observers saw Woodford, who speaks no Japanese, as the chairman Kikukawa's new pet. An article in Facta underlined the sceptics' views, saying \\"The fact that the company picked a bottom-ranking foreign executive director with virtually no significant responsibilities from amongst a total pool of 25 potential candidates, including the vice-president who was responsible for medical instruments ... set tongues a-wagging.\\" Woodford's promotion was announced through a press statement without calling a news conference. The press release, which was full of praise for Woodford, mentioned his success in cutting costs and presented him as the \\"new global face of Olympus\\". According to Woodford, Kikukawa had reminded him privately upon appointing him president: \\"I am the one who has the authority to hire and fire, and to decide remuneration for board members and the next tier down of management,\\" thus signalling Woodford was \\"little more than his puppet\\". The New York Times similarly suggested that the promotion may have been intended to instill Woodford with a greater sense of loyalty to the board, and Woodford suggested it was done to reduce his motivation to resign. Nikkei Business noted that the announcement was made only in its English web page, and after talking to Olympus, it commented: \\"Woodford's title had changed from COO to CEO, but it did not signify any real change in the company's leadership. Woodford himself was soon to realise that his appointment to CEO was in name only.\\" = Woodford's removal as CEO= If the intention of the promotion was to deter Woodford's questions, it did not have the intended effect. Following his appointment, Woodford persisted in pressing the issue of the questionable transactions, and, based on his belief that an internal probe would not get all the necessary answers, he also engaged accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to give substance to his suspicions. Woodford copied his final two letters to senior members of the Ernst & Young organisation (auditors to Olympus) in Japan, Europe and the United States, as well as their global chairman and CEO. PwC's report highlighted that as part of the deals, a \\"success fee\\" ‚Äì an intermediary's fee for closing an acquisition deal ‚Äì of $687 million for the Gyrus acquisition was paid to two small firms, US-based Axes America LLC and Cayman Islands-based Axam Investments Ltd. PwC also examined the transactions resulting in the $600 million write-down. Kikukawa convened an emergency board meeting on 14 October, and then, arriving late, cancelled the circulated agenda and asked the board to consider removing Woodford from his post of chief executive. Woodford was not allowed to speak or vote; the motion was carried unanimously, although he retained his seat on the board of directors.\\"Olympus Corporation Resolved Dismissal of President Michael C. Woodford\\". Olympus Corp. Archived from the original on 25 November 2011. Retrieved 25 November 2011 Kikukawa circulated a staff email the same day, stating that the departure was due to differences in management style, and that Woodford had \\"ignored established decision-making processes and created many wedges among the managers and within the organization ... vastly different to what we had expected of him, which was to accelerate decision-making and speed up the management.\\" After Woodford's removal, Kikukawa was re-appointed president and CEO of Olympus. One week later, he accused Woodford of having created \\"a gang\\" of direct reports that circumvented Mori, his supposed immediate subordinate. Kikukawa resigned on 26 October \\"to restore confidence in the company under the new management\\". At the press conference, he declared Olympus to be clean, continued to accuse Woodford of attempting to seize power, and maintained Woodford was \\"autocratic\\", and that his alleged offences \\"included intimidation of my own staff.\\" By contrast, Woodford alleged that his forced departure was linked to several prior acquisitions and payments he questioned, particularly the US$2.2 billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, and said on Bloomberg Television: \\"The board has to go, they're all toxic, they are all contaminated.\\" On 30 November, Woodford announced that he would resign from the Olympus board, saying that his decision was unrelated to the official investigations in Japan, the UK, and the USA. He added that his resignation was necessary in the context, and that he was \\"committed to ensuring that Olympus has the best possible opportunity to succeed going forward, starting with a new and untainted board of directors.\\" = Company's initial announcements following Woodford's departure= During a conference call with investors on 17 October (reported in a Morgan Stanley research note), Olympus Executive Vice-President Hisashi Mori said the company might sue Woodford for releasing internal information to news media. Olympus issued statements on 19 October defending the acquisitions of Altis, News Chef, and Humalabo, saying that they \\"were determined to have great potential in the medical and health care industries.\\" Press reported that although the three companies had \\"minuscule capital funds\\", their combined business value was estimated at between ¬•96.9‚Äì124.6 billion (US$1.3‚Äì1.6 billion). Olympus denied that the acquisitions were unrelated to the core business. The description given of the companies on 19 October, and how they fit into the group's strategy, were contradicted by the later statement: initially, Altis was described as being engaged in \\"environmental solutions business proposing resources recycling and CO2 reduction focused on petrochemical plants.\\" In a 27 October disclosure, the unit was \\"mainly engaged in recycling business for medical waste.\\" Humalabo was described initially said to undertake \\"research and development/sale of skin improving substances using [a fungus known as] basidomycota\\", but in the later statement was said to be \\"mainly engaged in development of [health] supplements with ingredients extracted from shiitake mushroom mycelium.\\" While the basic description of News Chef as a maker of cookware for microwave ovens was not changed, Olympus added that \\"disease prevention and prognosis through foods\\" was one of its objects. Olympus said on 19 October that the value of the stakes in the three companies had been impaired by ¬•55.7 billion ‚Äì more than three-quarters of the acquisition cost, blaming it on \\"worsened external environment following the 2008 recession.\\" However, it later admitted that \\"the business prospect diverged from the assumption we had at the time of the investment.\\" At a press conference in Tokyo on 27 October, president Takayama blamed Woodford for the decline in the company's share price, saying \\"If this secret information had not been leaked, there would have been no change in our corporate value.\\" Takayama said the amounts paid for Gyrus \\"will pay off considering what value we will gain from the Gyrus acquisition in the future.\\" He further justified the purchase of the three small Japanese companies as part of a strategy \\"to find new growth areas to reduce our over-reliance on the endoscope business.\\" However, Mori, who was the main speaker, and Takayama were criticised by impatient journalists for their responses that meandered without addressing the issues. =Olympus' internal investigation= Olympus delegated the task of selecting members of its third-party panel to investigate the allegations to two men who were appointed to the board in June: Yasuo Hayashida, a physician and visiting professor at Juntendo University, and Hiroshi Kuruma, a former executive at Nikkei Business. On 1 November, Olympus announced the composition of its third-party panel, headed by lawyer and former Supreme Court justice, Tatsuo Kainaka. The panel would include four lawyers and one certified public accountant. In the week of 6 November, Olympus announced that Hisashi Mori had been dismissed and auditor Hideo Yamada had resigned. At a press conference, Takayama revealed he had known \\"absolutely nothing\\" about the scheme until Mori informed him earlier in the week. He said Kikugawa, Mori ,and Yamada were not responsible for the initial investments, but had covered up the losses \\"with the company's best interests at heart\\". alt=a bespectacled oriental man in a dark suit bowing with brown curtains as backdrop At the news conference, Takayama bowed as he apologised for the \\"highly inappropriate disposal\\" of the losses. The Financial Times said Takayama had not addressed \\"the size and origin of Olympus' past losses; the identity of the executives who approved the initial cover-up; the exact means by which it was executed; and the reason it took so long to dispose of the bad assets.\\" Ahead of the much-awaited board meeting on 25 November, to be attended by Woodford, two directors ‚Äì Kikukawa and Mori ‚Äì announced their resignation; Yamada, who enjoyed observer status on the board, also resigned. Separately, current president Shuichi Takayama said the board members would resign once \\"the path to Olympus' revival became clear.\\" However, Woodford said: \\"If they have an iota of care for the company then they should ... resign in the near future.\\" According to Olympus, eight executives including Takayama were to take pay cuts of between 30 and 50 per cent starting December, to take responsibility for the accounting scandal; Takayama's salary would be halved. In mid-January 2012, Olympus published its panel's report. It decided that five individuals were responsible: auditors Minoru Ota and Katsuo Komatsu, outside auditors Makoto Shimada and Yasuo Nakamura, and standing auditor Tadao Imai. Ota was held responsible for ¬•3.7 billion, having been the head of the accounting division at the time the losses were made in the 1990s, the others were held jointly responsible for around ¬•4.7 billion for overlooking the illegal activities. The report cleared KPMG and Ernst & Young of any responsibility for the accounting fraud at the company and concluded that the scheme had been too well concealed. The report said: \\"The masterminds of this case were hiding the illegal acts by artfully manipulating experts' opinions.\\"  Regulator and law enforcement action  Following his dismissal, Woodford quickly travelled back to London, where he passed on a file of information to the British Serious Fraud Office, and requested police protection. He hinted that the payments may have been linked to \\"forces behind\\" the Olympus board; Japanese newspaper Sankei went further, to suggest that the payments could be linked to the Yakuza. The Financial Times reported that relevant authorities in several jurisdictions were investigating the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which had also been given files about the suspicious transactions by Woodford, opened its case in mid-October; other federal law enforcement agencies, including federal prosecutors in Manhattan, had also taken an interest. The SEC was said to be examining Axes America. Experts speculated that US investigators were assessing whether there were kickbacks to Olympus officials or whether money laundering or other illicit acts were involved. The British Serious Fraud Office and the FBI were said to be working with the Japanese Financial Services Agency. Olympus disclosed that they were being investigated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, while unnamed sources said that a unit of the Tokyo police dealing with organised crime may also be involved in the investigation. The Japanese Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are also reported to have taken an interest in the case. The New York Times published details of an official investigators' memorandum prepared for the SESC, the Tokyo prosecutor's office and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department which stated the true magnitude of losses was ¬•481 billion ($6.25 billion). It said that of the \\"questionable acquisition payments, investments and advisory fees\\" made between 2000 and 2009, only ¬•105 billion has been accounted for in some way. Investigators named Tsubasa Net, a software maker acquired by Olympus through ITX in 2005, as \\"a front company\\" with known affiliations with the Yamaguchi Gumi, the largest of Japan's yakuza organisations. Altis, Humalabo and News Chef ‚Äì acquisitions advised by Global Company ‚Äì were also identified as front companies with links to organised crime. The headquarters of Olympus Corp. was visited by Japanese prosecutors on 21 December 2011 as part its investigation; NHK TV said the home of Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former Olympus president, was also targeted by authorities looking into wrongdoing. Japanese authorities arrested seven individuals in connection with the case on 16 February 2012. These were former Olympus president Kikukawa, the former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori, former internal auditor Hideo Yamada. Also arrested were bankers Akio Nakagawa, Nobumasa Yokoo, and their associates Taku Hada and Hiroshi Ono. Other external responses and actions = Auditors = The accounts of Olympus were audited in the 1990s by the Japanese affiliate of then 'big five' accounting firm Arthur Andersen until the latter collapsed in 2002, when KPMG Azsa became its auditor. KPMG remained the auditor up until 2009, after which the Ernst & Young ShinNihon (EY) took over. At no point were any major issues signalled by the company's auditors; The Financial Times (FT) reported that KPMG had raised some questions when the firm audited Olympus, but audit reports were always unqualified, and EY signed off on \\"clean\\" audit reports in 2010 and 2011. According to an email sent by former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa that Michael Woodford made public, Olympus had replaced KPMG with EY after the former expressed disagreement with the accounting treatment of the Gyrus acquisition. The FT queried why, this being the case, KPMG had signed off on the 2009 accounts. Tsutomu Okubo raised a question in the upper house of the Diet as to why the auditors apparently failed to stop the cover-up; the Japanese Institute of Certified Accountants said that it would look into the auditors' role. According to a letter filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the auditors to Gyrus resigned \\"partly because of its client's accounting for the securities\\". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts because they could not ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the accounting treatment of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were \\"circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be brought to the attention of the company's members or creditors.\\" Ernst & Young, the firm that succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine- month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: \\"It's pretty evident to me there was very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit.\\" However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¬•71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over. Although the Olympus inquiry had questioned the auditors' signing off on the accounting treatment of preferred shares, and whether the handover from KPMG to Ernst & Young in 2009 was thorough, EY's own review in turn questioned \\"the thoroughness and accuracy\\" of the Olympus inquiry's findings. The EY concluded there were \\"no problems with the handover in terms of the guidelines,\\" but were looking into what more could have been done. It further said that its powers of investigation were limited by their inability to question the outgoing audit firm. = Stock market and stakeholder reactions = Olympus had a market capitalisation of ¬•673 billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By the end of the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¬•422 billion ($5.5 billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund which was one of the principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2 percent stake on the first hint of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 per cent to 5.11 per cent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 per cent to 7.6 per cent. Some major foreign institutional investors have pushed to bring back ousted chief executive Michael Woodford: UK fund manager Baillie Gifford, Harris Associates, and Southeastern Asset Management, owning respectively 4 percent, 5 percent and 5 percent stake, all believed he was the best candidate to lead the clean-up. Other investors have demanded more disclosures from the company about the state of its affairs. Domestic investors, including Nippon Life Insurance (8.4 percent stake), demanded \\"prompt action\\". alt=graphic showing share price movements showing drop on 13 October from 2500 yen, with wild gyrations thereafter, hitting a low of 460 yen on 11 November On 2 November, a shareholder from Nara Prefecture was reported to have asked the company's auditor to bring a case against former executives of Olympus to court to reimburse ¬•140 billion ($1.79 billion) to the company, failing which he will sue them through another rights group, Lawyers for Shareholders' Rights. Two American law firms announced that they were initiating 'investigations' of Olympus Corporation and some of its directors and were seeking investors who purchased Olympus ADRs between 7 November 2006 and 7 November 2011 on the grounds that the company's share price had been inflated through false accounting and that directors had hidden substantial losses by \\"false statements and material omissions\\". The quotation price of Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75 percent since the scandal erupted. The price continued to be volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¬•100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of unsatisfied buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834 yen at one point on 16 November. Many long-time employees of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt betrayed by the executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable. While foreign shareholders supported Woodford's proxy fight to replace the Olympus board, he failed to gain support from Japanese institutions; Sumitomo Mitsui bank, identified as the company's main creditor, warned Woodford that he would fail. Woodford was disappointed by their silence, but acknowledged that even had he won a shareholder vote to become chief executive, the antipathy towards him of major shareholders and creditors, and the discomfort within the company about his decision to publicly disclose the accounting irregularities, would have made running the company difficult. On 6 January 2012, on failing to secure support from Japanese institutional shareholders, Woodford said that the 12-week public scandal had taken an enormous emotional toll on him and his family, and announced that he would abandon his proxy fight to take control of the Olympus board. Instead, his lawyers had initiated legal proceedings in London seeking unspecified damages for dismissal from his four-year contract. Olympus convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting for 20 April 2012 to vote on its proposal for the new board and to approve the restated accounts. The board slate consisted of 11 candidates, the majority of whom were \\"completely independent\\" of Olympus. The company controversially sought to promote its executive officer, Hiroyuki Sasa, to president; its candidate for chairman was Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former senior executive of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. ‚Äì the largest creditor of Olympus. Another proposed director is Hideaki Fujizuka, formerly with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. While the company argued the candidates were well-qualified, a shareholder advisory firm urged investors to vote down the proposed president citing his lack of experience as a corporate manager of a turnaround situation; it also expressed concern that the ex-bankers may put banks' interests ahead of shareholders'. ISS also recommended shareholders not to approve the accounts on grounds that it could undermine any legal recourse they may want to pursue in future. Foreign shareholders oppose the nominations, citing \\"undue influence\\" of the creditor banks. = Corporate governance concerns = Masaki Shizuka of the TSE expressed the concern that \\"investor confidence in information provided by the company may decline.\\" Tsutomu Okubo, who is to chair a new working team to discuss reforms to the company act to strengthen corporate governance, questioned whether the corporate auditor system was functioning properly, and whether the company's accountants were acting as a proper check on management. Toshio Oguchi, representative director of Governance for Owners in Tokyo, argued that the affair pointed to a dysfunctional board: \\"Even if they didn't know about the tobashi, the fact that the board approved the payment cannot have been a correct decision.‚Äù The acquisition price tag was justified using sales forecast for the three companies ‚Äì Altis, Humalabo and News Chef ‚Äì of ¬•88.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 2013 ‚Äì which CFO Asia said was \\"practically impossible to achieve\\". It further noted that the combined sales targets for the three companies for the fiscal year to March 2012 were subsequently reduced by 93 percent to a combined ¬•6.5 billion (US$85.7 million). Despite the suspicions of wrongdoing, Olympus strongly denied suggestions that the transactions were \\"something illegal or unauthorized\\". CFO Asia said that if there was truly no corporate malfeasance, there are \\"uncomfortable questions about the competence of the internal and external teams that evaluated the three acquisitions, as well as the capabilities of the senior managers and board members that accepted the sky- high valuations and approved the deals.\\" Nikkei Business said similarly that the size of the losses \\"could very well call management responsibility into question\\". In a commentary in the Financial Times entitled \\"Olympus's deceit was dishonourable\\", John Gapper noted that \\"It is still possible to believe that the accused trio of directors ... thought they were behaving honourably ... [in hiding] failure discreetly and not to make their predecessors lose face.\\" He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was \\"a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down ‚Äì the 'advisory fee' was especially creative\\". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough questions about why the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned. Bloomberg View columnist William Pesek said: \\"Japan's corporate culture of denial, of ignoring problems and letting them fester, keeps running up against a globalized world that values agility, innovation and transparency. Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance.\\" While he also observed that the independence of the directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. \\"Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked.\\" Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price \\"trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they lose sight of the fact that they manage businesses, not share prices.\\" During a press conference in early November, Financial Services minister Shozaburo Jimi said the market should not call into question the standards of corporate governance of other listed companies just because of Olympus. However, some journals linked the case of Daio Paper Corp, also subject of a scandal involving diversion of funds by its chairman. = Other commentary = Floyd Norris of The New York Times said the cause of the losses was rooted in the Plaza Accord that caused the value of the dollar to slide from 250 yen in 1984, to 121 yen by the end of 1987, heavily penalising Japanese exports. \\"It turns out that it was an effort to make the company's [balance sheet] accurate ... It now appears the chairman reacted with righteous indignation. He had not stolen; he had only tried to clean up a mess without damaging the reputation of generations of Olympus executives.\\" Floyd says that the third-party investigation report commissioned by Olympus infers \\"there had been no need to tell Mr. Woodford about what had happened because the fraud was finally behind the company when Mr. Woodford took the job.\\" Financial Times questioned why the Japanese auditor firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US. The Economist said that the Olympus scandal \\"is not an accounting misdeed‚Äîit is a mindset. Olympus, and the response of Japanese officialdom, is less about a single sad incident as it is a view about the malleability of rules, and the subjectivity of their enforcement. Until Japan's institutions of governance‚Äîthose internal to the corporations, as well external regulators and prosecutors‚Äîchange, Japan cannot change.\\"  Aftermath  = Woodford after the scandal = During 2011 and 2012, Woodford was recognised as \\"Businessperson of the Year\\" for bravery and whistleblowing by The Sunday Times, The Independent and The Sun, and \\"Person of the Year\\" at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal \\"Boldness in Business Awards\\" in March 2012. He consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws, and road safety, and states he had given several millions of pounds to charities. Woodford, who stated he had received death threats over his exposing of the cover-up, settled a lawsuit against Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal for ¬£10 million in 2012. A book and film were also undertaken. Woodford stated his concerns that, far from learning from the scandal, Japan's response was to become even more secretive and unsupportive of change in areas highlighted by the scandal. = Olympus and wider aftermath after the scandal= In 2012, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 per cent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base. In July 2013, Kikugawa and Mori were both sentenced to 3 years in prison, 5 years suspended. The auditor who had been party to the fraud was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 4 years suspended. Olympus was fined 700 million yen ($7 million USD). In April 2014, six banks filed a civil suit against Olympus over the fraud, seeking an additional 28 billion yen in damages. The corporate culture exposed by the scandal is seen as the inspiration for the record-breaking drama Hanzawa Naoki.  Details of the suspect transactions  In the early 1990s, Yamaichi Securities was Olympus' main broker, but went bankrupt after accumulating ¬•260 billion in tobashi investment losses. In 1998, Nomura succeeded as Olympus' main broker. Prompted by the Yamaichi collapse, new \\"mark to market\\" accounting rules were made mandatory in 1999, from which time companies were obliged to disclose losses on their securities investments in a timely manner. Thomson Reuters reported that a fee of US$687 million, equal to 31 percent of the Gyrus acquisition price, was paid to a middle-man, whereas this is usually 1‚Äì2 percent. As part of his proof, Woodford released the report from PwC which showed that the sum of $670 million of the advisory payments was paid over to AXAM Investments Ltd., a Cayman Islands company. In June 2010, three months after receiving its final fees from Olympus, it was struck off by local company registry for non-payment of licence fees. Olympus revealed that the Axes fee included fees paid to Perella Weinberg Partners UK, who acted as financial advisor, and US law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who acted as legal advisers. The Telegraph said it has seen documents indicating a \\"Mr Sagawa\\" was a director of Axam Investments and Axes America that received a $687 million advisory fee for the Gyrus acquisition. The Financial Times said its principals were former Nomura employees. The link to the scam caused Nomura shares to fall, though the bank denied involvement, claiming it was \\"based on speculation and not on fact\\". Akio Nakagawa and Hajime Sagawa, both of whom started their careers at Nomura Securities and were also colleagues at Drexel Burnham Lambert and PaineWebber, were behind Axes, according to Reuters. Nakagawa, who was once head of equities at PaineWebber in Japan in the early 1990s, had long-standing relationship with Olympus. A former Paine Webber banker attested that Nakagawa and Sagawa were handlers for Olympus, and they made use of Bermuda-based funds valued at \\"hundreds of millions of dollars\\" to manage its balance sheet using Japanese accounting loopholes. Axes America, having negotiated the success fee for Gyrus in a combination of cash and stock, then transferred the stock component to AXAM Investments, an affiliate registered in the Cayman Islands. In 2010, the stock was sold back to Olympus for $620 million. Nobumasa Yokoo, former banker who had dealt with Olympus when he worked for Nomura, is also cited as being behind certain other of the transactions under the spotlight. Having founded Global Company in the late 1990s, he persuaded Olympus to invest ¬•30 billion in their venture capital fund in 2000. In 2003, Olympus made a piecemeal acquisition of an information technology group, ITX. Akinobu Yokoo, Yokoo's older brother, was chief financial officer for ITX. The elder Yokoo became a group executive officer after Olympus became majority owners. Nobumasa Yokoo also introduced three small, unprofitable companies in which he was shareholder and executive that Olympus acquired for ¬•73.4 billion ‚Äì News Chef, a maker of microwave cookware, Altis and Humalabo. According to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Olympus acquired the companies from Cayman Island-based funds between 2007 and 2010. Nikkei Business reported informed sources deriding these as \\"shell companies\\". Part of the transaction took place on 25 April 2008, when Olympus paid the equivalent of 7 million to funds named Dynamic Dragons II and Global Targets. Seventeen Cayman and BVI special purpose vehicles were used to make payments; funds flowed through Commerzbank AG, Societe Generale SA and LGT Bank. The WSJ noted that there were a large number of frequent and complex corporate changes (name and ownership) but determined from the paper trail that Dynamic Dragons II \\"was part of a network of elusive Japanese firms and financiers that often invested together, and whose ties and identities were constantly shifting.\\" Kenji Takasago, associate professor at Kobe University suggested the complexity of the scheme was to obscure the money trail. Jake Adelstein, former crime reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun, said these three acquired companies \\"shared addresses and office space with several other companies with different names but sometimes the same employees, creating a web of real and paper companies that make tracking the money very difficult.\\" He also alleged that Japanese authorities considered one of the auditors involved \\"a corporate blood brother ... to the Yamaguchi-gumi.\\" Sankei Shimbun said there were perhaps 10 brokers involved in the acquisition schemes, and that while they \\"are not members of crime syndicates themselves ... [some] ... conduct economic activities together with antisocial forces ... There is the possibility that Olympus has supplied cash (to organised crime) as a result.\\" However, the investigatory panel set up by Olympus rejected reports the allegations that the acquisition funds could found their way to organised crime. Panel chairman Tatsuo Kainaka said \\"Our committee has confirmed no such facts in its investigations so far.\\" = Structure of Gyrus commission = In mid June 2006 Olympus paid US-registered Axes America the sum of $3 million in \\"basic fees\\", and agreed to pay a \\"completion fee of 1 percent of the acquisition price in addition to the basic fee for advisory work relating to acquisitions.\\" One year later, the agreed rate of \\"completion fee\\" to Axes was increased to 5 percent, payable in a mixture of cash, share options and warrants; it disbursed a further $2 million. When the Gyrus acquisition was announced, Olympus paid over $12 million, being the cash portion of the agreed \\"completion fee\\". In September 2008, to top up the cash part of the advisors' success fee, Gyrus issued ¬•176.98 million of preferred stock to the AXAM against the advice of company auditors, according to Nikkei Business Daily. Olympus paid over a further $50 million, nominally as cash settlement for warrants. Regulatory disclosures in the UK show that the preferred stock was allotted on 30 September by Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, Hisashi Mori and Akihiro Nambu (the latter being head of investor relations for Olympus). The identity of the beneficiary ‚Äì Axam Investments ‚Äì was only made publicly known more than 18 months later. Three days after the preferred stock was allotted and without the benefit of professional advice, a \\"supplemental agreement\\" was signed by Olympus officers that gave AXAM power of veto over \\"any important decision in the Gyrus business\\". A buyback of preferred shares for $530‚Äì590 million was authorised by the Olympus board. Axam subsequently negotiated a further increase in the value of the shares, for which Olympus finally paid $620 million in March 2010. According to a UK corporate filing for Gyrus, the value of the securities at the time was disclosed as $177 million. Bloomberg notes that executives Olympus had delayed accounting for the true cost of the 'success fees' of Gyrus until March 2011, by which time Axam Investments had been struck off by the Cayman Islands registrar for nine months.

Shively is accessed by County Route 3. It is situated 7.2 miles from Harts and 9.3 miles from Chapmanville. Geography Shively is generally understood to represent the Smokehouse Fork and Buck Fork sections of Big Harts Creek. History Smokehouse Fork, known also in early records as the \\"Forks of Hart,\\" derives its name from Stephen Hart (Heart), an early settler, or his father, who erected a smokehouse to cure venison at the mouth of the fork. Early settlers of Smokehouse and Buck forks include members of these families: Butcher, Bryant, Conley, Dingess, Elkins, Farley, Hensley, Lambert, Mullins, and Tomblin. Key events of the Lincoln County Feud occurred at the homes of Henderson and Hugh Dingess on Smokehouse Fork in 1889. At that time, the lower section of Smokehouse Fork was included in Lincoln County. Shively is named for Charles Nelson Shively, who settled locally from Georges Run, Ohio about 1908. The name appears on a 1910 topographic map of Big Harts Creek at the mouth of White Oak Fork of Smokehouse Fork of Big Harts Creek. Later, the name appears in the lower section of Smokehouse Fork at Wolfpen Branch where the final post office building stands today. Economy Timbering served as the community's primary industry. During the 1880s and 1890s, Albert Dingess, Sr., was a leading timberman on the fork. In the 1890s, C. Dingess & Company operated a local timber firm. Several splash dams were constructed on Smokehouse Fork. Post Office Shively Post Office was established as early as 1923. A. Butcher was postmaster in 1923-1924 and mail was received tri-weekly. Ina E. Adams served as acting postmaster beginning on December 4, 1925. She served as postmaster from January 18, 1926 to August 2, 1935. John S. Butcher assumed charge of the post office on August 2, 1935. He served as postmaster from October 25, 1935 to January 1, 1949. Sallie Farley Adkins assumed charge of the post office on January 1, 1949. She served as postmaster until her resignation on July 22, 1958. Nora St. Clair assumed charge of the post office on July 22, 1958. Education Historically, the following schools have served the community: Browns Run School (est. 1892), Buck Fork School (est. 1894), Hugh Dingess School (est. 1897), Conley School (est. 1897), George Mullins School (est. 1910), and White Oak School (est. 1923). Only Hugh Dingess Elementary School remains open today. The 1925-1926 West Virginia Educational Directory lists a few teachers with Shively addresses: Ina Adams, Anna Butcher, and Lester H. Cross. Today, residents of Shively attend Chapmanville School, Harts PK-8 School, Chapmanville Middle School, and Chapmanville Regional High School.

Boucher (January 9, 1931 ‚Äì March 24, 2003) was an American city manager who served as town manager of Saugus, Massachusetts, and village manager of Ellenville, New York, and Maywood, Illinois. Early life and career Boucher graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in public administration. After interning in the state of Illinois, Boucher was a schoolteacher in Wyoming and Louisiana and ran an economic consulting business in Littleton, Colorado that specialized in local government. Buffalo, New York In December 1966, Boucher was appointed by Mayor Frank A. Sedita to serve as executive director of the Citizens Advisory Committee for Community Development in Buffalo, New York. Boucher's primary duty was to conduct a preliminary management survey to improve the efficiency of city government. On March 15, 1967 he reported that 1,400 to 1,600 jobs could be cut from the city payroll. His statement upset many high-ranking Democrats, including Mayor Sedita. After the statement, Boucher was described as \\"walking on eggshells\\" and being a \\"marked man\\" at City Hall. Boucher resigned in August 1967 after his management survey was completed. Saugus Town Manager On July 31, 1967, Boucher was chosen by the Saugus Board of Selectmen to serve as Town Manager on a six-month trial basis. During his tenure as manager, the town fought the state government to close the M. DeMatteo dump on Massachusetts Route 107. After the town declined a request by State Health Commissioner Alfred Frechette to keep the dump open, Governor John A. Volpe signed an emergency order that would reopen the dump. The town refused to comply with this order and the dump was not reopened until the state Department of Public Health was granted temporary restraining order by the Suffolk Superior Court. The state agreed to shut down the facility by December 1, 1967, however the dump remained open pass this deadline and the issue was once again brought before the courts. Boucher was also involved in a controversy over the new Saugus Junior High School. On October 4, 1967, he announced that he was launching an investigation into defects in the construction of the school. He later alleged that $200,000 in funds might have been misused and that he wanted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate if it had jurisdiction. Boucher met with an FBI agent on October 17 to turn over documents relating to alleged misuse of federal funds spent on equipment for the school. In November 1967, Boucher was hospitalized after a recurrence of a respiratory ailment. On February 20, 1968, the Board of Selectmen voted unanimously not to renew Boucher's six-month contract. Ellenville Village Manager On November 16, 1968, Boucher was appointed Village Manager of Ellenville, New York. Upon taking office, Boucher formulated a ten-point \\"program of progress\\", which consisted of centralizing purchasing, updating equipment and work methods, improving snow removal, implementing new budget procedures, hiring professional leadership for the street department, and creating programs for street renewal, narcotics control, youth, tree replacement, and the development of Mount Cathalia as a recreational facility. Of his ten points, Boucher was able to implement the first five, which he said resulted in \\"countless tax savings\\" for the people of Ellenville. In July 1969, Ellenville Trustee Rivan Krieger moved to remove Boucher from office after Boucher signed a check (worth $11.63) that should've gone to the New York State Employee's Retirement Fund over to himself. He was later accused of having falsely claimed be a graduate of two colleges. In August 1969, Boucher resigned, citing \\"political pressure\\" and his \\"deteriorating\\" relationship with the Ellenville Board of Trustees. Maywood Village Manager In March 1970, Boucher was named Village Manager of Maywood, Illinois. On May 6, 1970 he was arrested and charged with theft by deception, improper use of license plates, and failure to register a vehicle in Illinois. Boucher was accused of using the same camper truck as collateral for two loans, failing to register in the state of Illinois a 1970 Cadillac he purchased in Louisiana, and using New York plates issued to a different car on his Cadillac. On May 15, the village board voted to suspend him indefinitely without pay pending an investigation. The investigation found \\"gross irregularities in his application for employment\\". Boucher had falsely claimed to have earned bachelor's and master's degrees in public administration from Northwestern University. He had also claimed to served as city manager of Juneau, Alaska from 1958 to 1960, when he had actually been teaching. On May 28 the board voted to fire him. On April 26, 1971, he pleaded guilty to theft of property under $150. Boucher admitted to securing a $2,500 loan from the Maywood Employees Credit Union and pledging the title of a camper truck as collateral. Although the agreement for this loan stated that the title was unencumbered, there was in fact an outstanding lien. On May 15, 1971, he was sentenced to three years probation and order to repay the $2,500 and $300 interest at the rate of $200 a month. In August 1971, Boucher's probation was revoked after he failed make any of his scheduled payments to the credit union. At his revocation hearing, Boucher testified that he was unable to secure employment and that his main sources of income were a welfare stipend of $256 a month, which he sent to his brother, who was caring of his children, and unemployment benefits of $74 a week which he used to pay his rent and to care for his wife, who was in an institution. He was sentenced to one year in Cook County Jail. Boucher appealed the order revoking his probation to the Illinois Appellate Court on the grounds that his rights under the Illinois and United States Constitutions were violated because his imprisonment would be \\"tantamount to imprisonment of an indigent for failure to pay a debt\\". The appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court of Cook County's decision on March 14, 1973. The Supreme Court of Illinois granted leave to appeal and on May 20, 1974, vacated the appellate court's decision. Personal life Boucher was married to Betty Boucher. They had three children. While they were in Saugus, Betty Boucher pushed for the creation of a town theater company. At her urging the Saugus Towncriers, now known as the Theatre Company of Saugus, was founded. Boucher's hobbies included collecting rare books, listening to classical music, photography, fossil hunting, skiing, hiking, and sailing.

All Under Heaven: Recipes from the 35 Cuisines of China. Page 208. Ten Speed Press. Kindle Edition. The flavor may vary from one region to another, but the basic ingredients remain the same: ground pork marinated and boiled in soy sauce served on top of steamed rice. It is a type of gaifan dish.  Origin  How the dish was developed is not as clear. According to a study by a professor from the a similar meat sauce dish dates back to at least China's Zhou Dynasty. The Book of Rites records: \\"In a saucepan cook meat, and stir after adding seasoning until mostly browned sauce, then pour the meat sauce on cooked rice.\\" There is also a description of these foods in the novel \\"Water Margin\\" by Suzhounese writer Shi Nai'an.Huimin Zhou, The best drinking party: Cultural history on the table, SanMin Book, 2018-01-05,ISBNÔºö9789571463582 (Version (Traditional) In time, the dish developed into countless regional variations. These different varieties can be found all over China with the Taiwanese version bearing strongest resemblance to those found in Southern Fujian. This gives credence to the theory that minced pork rice was brought to Taiwan by Fujianese immigrants.  Etymology  According to Shuowen Jiezi (Ë™™ÊñáËß£Â≠ó, Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters), the word \\"Lu (Êª∑)\\" has the closest meaning to \\"cooking in thick broth or sauce.\\" This gives the term \\"Êª∑ËÇâÈ£Ø\\" the direct meaning of \\"rice with braised meat.\\" However, for several decades, many Taiwanese people have used the homophone \\"È≠Ø\\" instead of \\"Êª∑\\". Although people still use the original character in China, \\"È≠ØËÇâÈ£Ø\\" has become the most common name seen in Taiwanese restaurants and street vendors. È≠Ø is the ancient name for the Chinese province of Shandong, which led the Michelin Green Guide Taiwan to write in April 2011 that minced pork rice originated from Shandong. This confusion then led to a fierce debate in which most Taiwanese insisted that minced pork rice was in reality a true symbol of Taiwan, while others viewed it as a Chinese dish that caught on in Taiwan. Since minced pork rice was first recorded in the Zhou Dynasty, it is entirely possible that the dish did originate in Shandong or close by in the region of North China.Huimin Zhou, The best drinking party: Cultural history on the table, SanMin Book, 2018-01-05,ISBNÔºö9789571463582 (Version (Traditional) Taiwanese gourmets Hu Tianlan and Zhu Zhenduo agree that it is highly likely that the dish originated from Shandong based on historical records and the cooking style bearing a strong resemblance to Shandong cuisine.  Preparation  As the origin of the flavor, the sauce is the key to making minced pork rice. The most popular way of preparation seen in Taiwan is stir-frying the ground meat with sliced shallot in oil, and then boiling it in soy sauce. In the frying process, one may customize the flavor by adding seasonings such as sugar, rice wine, pepper and other spices. When finished, the dark-brown meat sauce is called \\"bah-s√≤ (ËÇâÁá•)\\", and is also served with noodles, soup, vegetables and many homemade Taiwanese dishes. The dish is commonly served with stir-fried vegetables and a marinated hard boiled egg on the side.  Regional varieties  While minced pork rice is an important icon in typical Taiwanese folk cuisine, the variety of methods to customize flavors is so wide that it creates considerable differences between regions. In southern Taiwan, where people name it by the sauce \\"bah-s√≤-pnÃÑg (ËÇâÁá•È£Ø)\\" instead of the meat, minced pork rice is preferably served with pork with less fat. People in the north of Taiwan favor a greasier version of meat sauce with rice, sometimes even with glutinous rice mixed in. In southern Taiwan, while \\"bah-s√≤-pnÃÑg\\" is seen on the menu indicating minced pork rice, \\"l√≥Õò-bah-pnÃÑg (Êª∑ËÇâÈ£Ø)\\" remains on the very same menu, referring to another dish where braised pork belly covers the rice. The same rice with braised pork belly is known as \\"kh√≤ng-bah-pnÃÑg (ÁÑ¢ËÇâÈ£Ø)\\" in northern Taiwan. Minced pork rice can also be found in China, and a wider selection of vegetables such as corn is eaten along with it.

Prior to 1914, the Carrancista faction was responsible for most attacks along the border, but in January 1915 rebels known as Seditionistas drafted the Plan of San Diego and began launching their own raids. The plan called for a race war, to rid the American border states of their Anglo-American population, and the annexation of the border states to Mexico. However, the Seditionistas were never able to launch a full-scale invasion of the United States so they resorted to conducting small raids into Texas. Much of the fighting involved the Texas Ranger Division, though the United States Army also engaged in small unit actions with bands of Seditionist raiders. Seditionista campaign The height of the fighting was in 1915. On January 6, Basilio Ramos and a group of his followers drafted the Plan of San Diego, in San Diego, Texas, to try and bring the American border states under the rule of President Venustiano Carranza. Calling themselves the Seditionistas, the rebels then began attacking small American outposts and settlements along the Rio Grande, many of which were guarded by United States Army soldiers. The first attack took place on July 4, 1915, when a band of approximately forty mounted rebels crossed the border and raided Los Indios Ranch in Cameron County. The first bloodshed did not occur until five days later though, on July 9, when an employee of the King Ranch killed one of the raiders near the Norias Ranch. On July 11, two Mexican-American police officers were shot, from a distance, near Brownsville, both died.ODMP memorial Deputy Constable Falcon and Deputy Sherriff Cuellar American authorities said \\"the Mexican officers knew of the plans [Plan of San Diego] of their fellows before the real beginning of the operations and that this was the cause of the several efforts to assassinate them.\\" Over the next two weeks there were various reports of raids, attacks on police officers, and assassination attempts on local land owners. By the end of July, the raiders were trying to cut off communications to the people in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and disrupt railroad transportation. On July 25, they burned a bridge belonging to the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway and then cut some telegraph wires near Harlingen. A few days after that, the Governor of Texas, James E. Ferguson, sent the Texas Ranger Captain Harry Ransom into the Lower Rio Grande Valley to lead a \\"pacification campaign.\\" According to author John William Weber, Ransom was in charge of an \\"assassination squad\\" that conducted a \\"scorched-earth campaign of annihilation\\" against both guilty and innocent Mexicans.Plan of San Diego  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)Weber, pg. 79-94 Some people suspected that the current fighting would ignite a full- fledged war between the United States and Mexico. One South Texan wrote; \\"I have never been satisfied with the Alamo and Goliad events, and always have felt that there was something yet due the Mexicans from us, and if there is a second call and for a war, the Mexicans will certainly get what is due them from the Texans.\\" On July 29, a Mexican named Adolfo Munoz was killed near San Benito for \\"scheming to rob a local bank and having connections with armed raiders.\\" Cameron County Deputy Sheriff Frank Carr and the Texas Ranger Daniel Hinojosa arrested Munoz but, according to the officers, when they were leaving San Benito a party of eight armed men, wearing masks, forced them to give up Munoz. On the next day, Munoz's body was found about two miles from town, \\"riddled with bullets\\" and hanging from a tree. The lynching, whether perpetrated by the rebels or by the Texans, created an atmosphere of distrust among the local Mexican population for the Texas Rangers and other American police forces. J. T. Canales said; \\"every person who was charged with a crime refused to be arrested, because they did not believe that the officers of the law would give them the protection guaranteed them by the Constitution and the laws of this State.\\" A lawyer in San Benito, named William G. B. Morrison, said that Munoz's lynching was \\"the spark that fired the flame among the white people.\\" However, a federal investigator said that the lynching was \\"an expression of the indignation of the people against the repeated failure to enforce the laws.\\" John William Weber says that \\"personal conflict\\" was the cause of some of the violence. Weber says the \\"most important example\\" was that of Aniceto Pizana, the owner of Los Tulitos Ranch. Pizana's neighbor, Jeff Scrivener, was known for wanting Pizana's land so in early August he told American authorities that Pizana was in league with the rebels and had harbored some of them during one of their raids. Despite this accusation, no evidence suggests that Pizana ever had any significant ties with the rebels, though he was a friend of Luis de la Rosca, a known raider who owned a store in Rio Hondo. In response to Scrivener's claim, a force of about thirty Texas Rangers, United States Army soldiers, and some deputy sheriffs attacked the Los Tulitos Ranch on August 3. During the gunfight that followed, one soldier was killed, and three other people were wounded, including two deputy sheriffs and Pizana's son. Pizana himself got away and according to Weber he joined up with Luis de la Rosca after the attack on his ranch. From then on Rosca and Pizana became the \\"primary military leaders of the Plan [of San Diego].\\" On August 6, Luis de la Rosca led a raid on the town of Sebastian, killing A. L. Austin and his son Charles. Austin formerly served as the president of the Law and Order League which, according to federal investigators, \\"had driven several bad men out of that section [Sebastian, Texas]\\" and was therefore an ideal target for the raiders who thought of him as a racist. Within the next few days after the deaths of the Austins, several local Mexicans were killed by either the Texas Rangers or vigilantes. A posse led by the Texas adjudant general, Henry Hutchings, and Captain Ransom killed three people alone. Meanwhile, the rebels were destroying railroad property by ripping up tracks, burning bridges and attacking the repairmen who were sent to fix the problems. The \\"most daring\\" raid during the Seditionistas' campaign occurred at the Norias Ranch, the headquarters for the southernmost division of the King Ranch. On the night of August 8, somewhere between forty-five and seventy rebels attacked Norias which was defended by a squad of American cavalrymen, a few policemen and a few ranchers. During the two-hour battle that followed, at least a dozen people were killed or wounded and possibly many more before the rebels retreated back towards Mexico. Another battle was fought on the next morning when the Mexican raiders encountered a force of Texas Rangers and soldiers as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande. The Americans reported that as many as twelve more rebels were killed and that very few made it across the river. For the next few weeks western Texas was plagued by \\"almost daily killings\\", the most notable of which occurred on October 19. That day a band of raiders derailed a train six miles north of Brownsville and killed several white people on board, leaving the Mexican passengers unhurt. When Captain Ransom arrived at the scene he found four Mexicans in the vicinity and executed them all. On October 21, Rosca and Pizana led in between twenty-five and 100 rebels in the last important raid of the Seditionista campaign. Like most of the raids it was a failure for the rebels. This time a squad of eight army signalmen were besieged by the Mexicans at Ojo de Agua until being relieved by twelve men from the 3rd Cavalry, under Captain W. J. Scott. At least seven rebels died as result of the battle and at least seven others were wounded. The Americans suffered one civilian death, three soldiers killed and eight wounded.Pierce, pg. 97Investigation of Mexican Affairs, pg. 1247Norias Ranch Raid  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) By December 1915 the threat of Mexican raiders was slowly diminishing but in the summer of 1916 a series of minor attacks began, all them occurring around Laredo, Texas. That year Luis de la Rosca recruited his Villista cousin Jose Morin to capture San Antonio but a baker in Kingsville, known as Victoriano Ponce, informed the Texas Rangers who arrested both men in May. The two were apparently murdered by the rangers because they were never seen again after their arrest. According to United States Army investigators, over 300 Mexicans had been killed during the Seditionistas' campaign.

The investigation initially focussed on possible failure to remove one of the flight control chocks, defective flight instruments, misuse of the wing flaps, structural failure of the tailplane, defective elevator control system, misuse of the automatic pilot, and incorrect loading. Control chocks for the left aileron, one elevator and the rudder were found correctly stowed in the remains of the aircraft's rear fuselage compartment. Searchers were unable to find the chock for the other elevator or the right aileron, either at the crash site or on the ground between the runway and the crash site. On the morning after the accident an MMA apprentice found the missing elevator chock on the tarmac close to where VH-MME was positioned for an engine test run the previous afternoon. The investigators carried out a flight test on a DC-3 to determine what effect, if any, was caused by installing an aileron chock on the elevator. They found there was no effect and the presence of the chock did not prevent the pilot having full control of the elevator. Staff of the Department of Civil Aviation calculated the most likely position of the centre of gravity on the fatal flight and found it was about 3.3% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord behind the rear limit. They carried out some flight tests in a DC-3 with its centre of gravity 4.7% of MAC behind the rear limit and found there was a loss of longitudinal static stability that made it difficult to trim the aircraft for a constant airspeed but the low-speed flight handling qualities had not deteriorated seriously. They concluded that the incorrect position of the centre of gravity did not adequately explain the accident and there must have been some other cause, possibly highly unusual. The investigation ended without determining the cause.\\"Air Tragedy Inquiry\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 29 September 1949, p.16 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011  Inquest  In August 1949 the City Coroner, R. P. Rodriguez, conducted an inquest into the deaths of the 18 people on board the aircraft. A dispatch officer with MacRobertson Miller Aviation observed the aircraft take off normally, then climb to an almost vertical position, roll over and dive vertically towards the ground, twisting as it did so. Written evidence from the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower stated that he observed the aircraft turn through 180 degrees as though in a spiral turn or spin. Some witnesses who lived at the South Guildford housing camp believed one of the aircraft's engines had failed by the time of the crash. The City Coroner was satisfied both engines were operating normally during the takeoff and up until the time of the impact. A medical officer conducted post-mortem examinations of the bodies. He confirmed there was no indication of alcohol in the bodies of any of the pilots. All on board died of multiple injuries before being burned. A resident of the housing camp who was one of the first witnesses to arrive at the crash scene told the City Coroner she saw the air hostess in the cockpit, standing beside the pilot. The City Coroner was satisfied that the aircraft was airworthy and neither MacRobertson Miller Aviation nor the pilot did anything negligent to cause the fatal crash.  Inquiry  On 28 September 1949 the Minister for Civil Aviation, Arthur Drakeford, announced that a court of inquiry would be held to investigate the accident because the investigation by the Department of Civil Aviation had been unable to determine the exact cause. Mr Justice Wolff of the Supreme Court of Western Australia was appointed to chair the inquiry. The inquiry commenced on 12 December 1949.\\"Air Disaster Inquiry\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 5 October 1949, p.24 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 = Observations = The inquiry received evidence from the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower at the time of the takeoff. He observed the aircraft climb at a steeper rate than any airline-operated aircraft he had seen previously. When the aircraft was at a height of about the left wing dropped sharply, as if in a stall. The nose dipped and the aircraft seemed to rotate through 180 degrees before dropping vertically. A ground engineer also saw the aircraft climb abruptly before it nosed over and twisted twice as it dived to the ground. = Aircraft loading = The inquiry heard that on 27 June 1949 the Department of Civil Aviation sent a letter to MacRobertson Miller Aviation advising that the methods used by its operational personnel to check the weight and balance of company aircraft did not conform to the appropriate requirements, and that approved methods must be used in the future. In response, the Operations Manager for MacRobertson Miller Aviation sent specific instructions to pilots on 30 June. On 1 July, the day before the accident, the Operations Manager discussed his instructions with the pilots of the accident flight. Staff involved with the loading of aircraft were instructed to use the method of Index Units to check that the centre of gravity of an aircraft was within limits. The employee who loaded the freight and passengers' luggage on the accident flight told the inquiry that after the freight was loaded, a check of the aircraft weight and balance showed that about of freight should be removed. Freight weighing was then removed. However, this employee believed the Load Sheet column labelled Index Units was not completed. There were suggestions the aircraft had been incorrectly loaded with in the rear baggage locker when it was assumed only would be carried there.\\"Loading Discussed Before Crash\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 16 December 1949, p.12 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011\\"Load Distribution In Crashed DC3\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 15 December 1949, p.8 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 The accuracy of statements regarding 1,400 lb was challenged. = Control chocks = The inquiry heard that the first officer had been unable to find all the control chocks normally used to lock the control surfaces on the aircraft while it was parked. There were concerns that one of the aircraft's control chocks might have been left in position instead of being removed before takeoff. The inquiry heard that all chocks were eventually accounted for.\\"Chock Found On Tarmac After DC3 Crash\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 14 December 1949, p.13 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 There was also a concern that one of the aileron chocks might have been inadvertently inserted in the elevator circuit. Chief Inspector James Harper told the inquiry that he made some test flights in a DC-3 aircraft in a similar configuration to the Fitzroy on the accident flight. One test showed that the DC-3 could be flown satisfactorily even with an aileron chock in the elevator circuit. Harper was satisfied the aircraft did not take off with the elevator locked. = Pilot competency = The pilot in command of the aircraft on the accident flight was Captain William Norman. Captain Cyril Kleinig, an approved checking pilot with MacRobertson Miller Aviation, gave evidence to the inquiry. He had flown with Captain Norman on many occasions and described him as competent. A pilot who had flown the Fitzroy to Carnarvon and return the day before the accident told the inquiry the aircraft had behaved normally. He also said he had flown with Captain Norman many times and found him to be careful and competent, and more meticulous than most in performing his cockpit drills. = Air hostess = Two residents of the housing camp who were among the first to arrive at the crash scene told the inquiry they could see two bodies in the wreckage of the cockpit ‚Äì a male and a female, both wearing uniform, so they presumed the bodies were those of the pilot and air hostess. One described the female as having fairly long blonde hair. The superintendent of air navigation and safety in the western region of the Department of Civil Aviation said the bodies of the pilot and first officer were found in their correct seats in the cockpit. Particular attention was paid to the body found closest to the rear of the cabin, a few feet (a metre) forward of the hostess's seat. The body was that of a female. Another witness was an employee of MacRobertson Miller Aviation who raced from the airport to the scene of the crash. He contradicted the evidence that the body of a woman could be seen in the cockpit. He told the inquiry the air hostess had red hair. = Irregularities = The inquiry exposed certain irregularities in MacRobertson Miller Aviation's operations. These irregularities centred on the loading of aircraft, proper completion of Load Sheets, and administrative methods.\\"Irregularities Exposed In Crash Inquiry\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 21 December 1949, p.14 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 = Counsels' summaries = The Department of Civil Aviation was represented by Henry Winneke.\\"Counsel's Submissions At Air Crash Inquiry\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 22 December 1949, p.11 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 Mr Winneke suggested to the inquiry that the immediate cause of the accident was that the pilot lost flying control of the aircraft. He said the reason for this loss of control was unknown although incorrect loading of the aircraft may have contributed. He acknowledged the excellent work done by the Department's accident investigators in attempting to determine the cause. George Pape, counsel representing MacRobertson Miller Aviation, warned against speculating on what might have caused the crash and urged the court to make an explicit finding that loading of the aircraft was not a possible factor contributing to the cause of the crash. The inquiry sat for seven days and adjourned on Wednesday 21 December 1949. =Report and findings= The report and findings of the inquiry were not released until 8 March 1950 when the new Minister for Civil Aviation, Thomas White, tabled them in the House of Representatives. The report confirmed that the crash occurred because the aircraft stalled and the pilots were unable to regain control. However, the evidence was not sufficient to allow determination of what caused the stall. The report conceded that over-loading of the aircraft's rear baggage compartment may have contributed to the stall.\\"Critical Report On Air Crash\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 9 March 1950 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012\\"Drastic Penalty For W.A. Airline Avoided\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 9 March 1950, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012 The inquiry acknowledged that the operator, MacRobertson Miller Aviation, had distributed instructions about aircraft loading to its pilots on 30 June but considered more should have been done. On the night of the accident the pilot in command had not checked the loading calculations performed by the two men responsible for loading the aircraft, as he was required to do, although the inquiry acknowledged there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the pilot in command was responsible for the accident. The inquiry considered the man responsible for loading the rear baggage compartment possessed inadequate knowledge of aircraft loading and had been untruthful. He had invented his story to hide his over-loading of the compartment.\\"Air Crash Report\\" The Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì 9 March 1950, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012\\"Air firm was warned, days before crash\\" The Argus ‚Äì 9 March 1950, p.8 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012 The inquiry was critical of the operator and the Department of Civil Aviation. In particular, it was critical of the operator's poor standards of maintenance of aircraft instruments. For this reason, the inquiry recommended the operator's airline licence should be suspended or cancelled. It also considered the Department should have made more checks of the operator's methods and record keeping. The Minister declined to take action against the operator, saying its maintenance record keeping had improved significantly since the accident. He also cited the hardship that would be inflicted on many remote communities in Western Australia if the operator's airline licence were to be suspended or cancelled. The Minister said his Department would be extra vigilant towards the operator but conceded there were limits to what could be done without significant increases in staff numbers.\\"Air-Crash Inquiry Findings\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 9 March 1950, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012 The inquiry was also critical of the lack of qualifications and experience of the pilot in command, the late Captain Norman. It said Norman should not have been promoted to Captain, and evidence from Captain Kleinig in support of Captain Norman was worthless. It recommended that promotion of a pilot to Captain of an airliner should be at the discretion of the Department of Civil Aviation, and that the Department should take account of all records and reports of tests relating to the applicant. The Managing-Director of MacRobertson Miller Aviation, Mr E.C. Gare, rejected claims of incorrect loading on the night of the accident. He also defended Captain Norman, saying he had 3,500 hours flying experience and an unblemished record.\\"Comment By M.M.A.\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 9 March 1950, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 5 March 2012  Aircraft  The aircraft was constructed as a Douglas C-47A-20-DL transport aircraft with a Douglas serial number 9350. It was completed in April 1943 and assigned the military serial number 42-23488. It was delivered to the US Army Air Force in Brisbane in May 1943. In July 1946, it was acquired by MacRobertson Miller Aviation and ferried from the Philippines to Perth, where it was converted from a military C-47 to a civil DC-3 with seating for 21 passengers.\\"Airport Round-Up\\" The West Australian ‚Äì 15 March 1947, p.14 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 11 November 2011 It was registered by MacRobertson Miller Aviation in March 1947 and named Fitzroy.

It stars Jon Taffer, a long-time food and beverage industry consultant specializing in nightclubs, bars, and pubs, who offers his professional expertise plus renovations and equipment to desperately failing bars in order to save them from closing. The show premiered on what was then known as Spike in the United States on July 17, 2011. In the UK, the show originally aired on 5*, later moving to Spike (UK). A spin-off series titled Marriage Rescue premiered on June 2, 2019.http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/05/02/paramount-network-expands- rescue-franchise-starring-jon-taffer-950113/20190502paramount01/ On September 22, 2020, it was announced that the series will move to another ViacomCBS network, as part of the Paramount Network's upcoming programming shift to television films and miniseries. Overview The series stars Jon Taffer, owner and chairman of bar/nightclub consulting firm Taffer Dynamics, Inc. Taffer is a bar and nightclub owner who has started, flipped, or owned numerous establishments in a career that spans over three decades. Bar owners submit an application via the Paramount Network website to have their failing establishment \\"rescued\\" by Taffer and his team of experts.Spike's Bar Rescue is Casting for Season 3 A typical episode begins with Taffer's team performing reconnaissance and surveillance on a struggling bar to determine its operational and service weaknesses. For the recon, one or more team members and/or local residents enter the bar, order food and drinks to gauge their quality, and form an opinion of the atmosphere and service. The surveillance involves hidden cameras, pre-installed with the owner's consent, through which Taffer and his team watch the kitchen and customer service areas. He then introduces himself to the owner(s) and staff to discuss his findings, and to describe the changes he believes should be made (management, customer service, cleanliness, etc.) in order to make the bar profitable. He also examines the bar's financial records to find possible cost savings. During these meetings, Taffer exhibits a brusque, no-nonsense, and confrontational attitude intended to goad the owner(s) and staff into making drastic changes to the way the bar is run ‚Äì including the firing of inept and/or dishonest employees when necessary. Taffer's team members train the staff on methods of improving food/drink preparation, customer service, and efficiency, frequently concentrating on a more limited selection of recipes than the bar typically offers. After the initial training, Taffer puts the bar through a \\"stress test\\" (similar to a soft opening), inviting in a large crowd of patrons in order to determine how well the staff can use their newly learned skills to deal with the pressure of a busy night. He uses market research, technological tools, and partner companies to scientifically measure the bar's performance. After discussing the stress test's results with owners and staff, Taffer meets with his experts to begin devising a new concept for the bar. The experts put the staff through a second, more extensive phase of training, overhauling the menu to fit the new concept. Once this phase is complete, Taffer closes the bar for a few days so that construction crews can redesign the interior. Deep-cleaning and structural work are performed when necessary. After the overhauled bar (often re-branded with a completely new name or a variation of the old one) is unveiled, Taffer takes the owners and staff on a tour to point out its new features. During the grand re-opening, he observes the overall improvement as a large crowd again packs the bar. An epilogue segment describes the changes in the bar's success or failure since the re-opening, through a combination of text and interviews with the owners and staff. Bars are not required to keep the changes that Taffer implements, and some have reverted to their original names, concepts, and/or menus since being featured on the show. The bars featured on the show are already in dire financial and operational situations by the time Taffer intervenes, posting a significant challenge to a turnaround. Despite this, data shows that over half the bars featured, 92 of the first 166 featured through the midway point of season 6, have remained open, with the remaining 74 unable to overcome their challenges. Production The series is from The Biggest Loser producers J.D. Roth and Todd A. Nelson for 3 Ball Productions/Eyeworks US. Spike announced picking up 10 episodes of Bar Rescue in January 2011. The show began shooting in April 2011. It was renewed on September 14, 2011 for a second season in the summer of 2012, from which the first episode of that season aired on July 29. Season 3 of the show premiered on February 10, 2013. On May 9, 2013, Spike TV renewed Bar Rescue for a fourth season of 20 more episodes. On March 21, 2014, Spike TV ordered 20 more episodes of Bar Rescue. On June 27, Taffer announced on his Facebook page that he would begin shooting 30 episodes for season 4 after a week-long trip to Paris. The first half premiered on October 5, 2014 while the second half premiered on February 8, 2015. On May 30, 2015, Taffer announced on his Facebook page that he finished shooting season 4. It was announced that the remaining episodes for season 4 would air beginning Sunday, June 21, 2015. In May 2015, Taffer announced season 5, with at least 20 episodes, on his Facebook page, with an update from Spike, issued in July 2016, that they had increased the fifth season to a total of 30 episodes. A sixth season was announced with a March 11, 2018 start date. On May 2, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season with 12 episodes. The seventh season's roll-out from March 2020 until June 2020 was a victim of unfortunate timing, starting at the first height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Due to stay-at-home orders throughout the country and takeout food- only non-alcohol restrictions placed on the industry, the majority of the bars featured in the season were unable to take advantage of the post-episode publicity boost usually afforded the featured bars. It also effectively froze the show indefinitely from any future filming or planning for a presumptive eighth season. Failed rescues The bars featured on the show are already in dire financial and operational situations by the time Taffer intervenes, posting a significant challenge to a turnaround. Nearly half the bars featured, 74 of the first 166 featured through the midway point of season 6, were unable to overcome their challenges. For example, the changes the show made to Downey's Irish Pub, featured in the July 24, 2011, episode \\"Downey's and Out\\", were not enough to prevent a planned sheriff's sale on August 2, 2011, due to $2.4 million owed to the city of Philadelphia and Wells Fargo bank, including $125,881 in business-privilege, wage, liquor and other taxes. Breakwall (from the season 1 episode, \\"Beach Bummer\\") closed in January 2012. Season 1's Swanky Bubbles, after reverting to its original title, has also closed its doors. The show's first rescued bar of season 2, Piratz Tavern, reverted to its original pirate theme and would later close in April 2015 (see below). The Chicken Bone, Canyon Inn, Angry Ham's Garage, Weber's Place, The Brixton, ZanZbarBar Rescue: Back to the Bar, aired 5 April 2015 Stand Up Scottsdale!, and KC's reverted to their original names. The Chicken Bone brought back its previously popular menu, while Angry Ham's replaced unpopular items with previously popular items from its original menu. Season 2's J.A. Murphys was sold by the owners shortly after the makeover, becoming a Mexican restaurant.Bar Rescue, \\"Taffer's Top 10: Toughest Rescues\\", airdate June 29, 2014 Stand Up Scottsdale reverted to its original name due to problems with becoming a franchise of The Laugh Factory. Rocket Room 6 in Austin, Texas, reverted to its old name, The Brixton, 6 weeks after its relaunch. The owner continued his use of social media to insult critics who were documented in the show, although the bar was not closed. The Rocky Point Cantina in Tempe, Arizona, closed after a repaint of the bar triggered a code inspection, which uncovered years of modifications to the building that had been completed without building permits. The bar owner opted to close the bar rather than bring his building up to code.\\"Bar Rescue\\" goes bad: Work permits were not obtained =Piratz Tavern= The pirate-themed Piratz Tavern in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been rebranded Corporate Bar and Grill by Taffer, reversed all of the changes Taffer made to the bar shortly after their episode was filmed. The owner released a YouTube video called \\"Piratz Revenge\\", showing the \\"Corporate\\" sign created by Taffer's team being shot at and burned in effigy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSPkbJohdyo The video was heavily disliked by YouTube viewers, and garnered a positive rating of only 4%. Taffer of their decision, \\"If you had a pirate concept that had failed for five years and had a new concept, would you go back to the concept that failed for five years or try something new? It defies logic that someone would go back to a (failed) concept just because they don't like the new name.\\" The owners blamed the \\"negative publicity\\" on the show. Piratz was revisited as part of the April 5, 2015 episode, in which Taffer grades the bar an \\"epic fail\\", and the owner sought a second rescue. Within a week of the revisited episode's premiere, however, Piratz decided to close its doors for good. In a \\"Back to the Bar\\" episode, the owners made amends with Taffer and announce that they plan to open a new bar, Bar Refuge, within the next year in Florida. They also appeared alongside their daughter in the episode \\"Getting Freaky at the Tiki\\" as recon spies for The Tiki Lounge. =LABrewCo failure= Taffer's most expensive rescue also resulted in his biggest failure. His visit to The Los Angeles Brewing Company during season 4 saw him put $1 million into updating the bar, which included the installation of a self-service beer tap and an in- house brewing system, which was intended to allow the bar, which was rebranded as LABrewCo, to start serving its own beer. Four months after the rescue, the brewing system was discovered to have never been used, the self-serve tap was disconnected, and the owner had reverted changes to the bar taps and the menu. In addition, LABrewCo's liquor license had been suspended and the business was put up for sale. =The Dugout= Taffer's redesign of baseball-themed bar The Dugout, across the street from Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois, resulted in a series first: Taffer redesigned the bar, but didn't hold a grand reopening. The owner, Ed, previously owned the building while the bar was owned by a tenant. After months of no rent paid, Ed evicted the owner and took over. Not wanting a bar, Ed refused to take advantage of the massive potential profit: the bar was across from Wrigley Field. This frustrated his staff to no end and his constant drinking and attitude made him no shortage of enemies. Every attempt by Taffer and his experts to get through to Ed failed miserably, as he would barely react, let alone show emotion, earning him the nickname \\"Smiling Ed\\". In the end, Taffer only showed the staff the newly dubbed \\"Press Box\\" and left the next move up to them. When Ed showed up drunk, several staff members quit and Taffer left. As of now, the bar is still open. However, Ed has split it into two parts: The Dugout on the bottom floor and the Press Box on top. He also still shows little interest in saving the bar and no gratitude towards Bar Rescue. Walkouts Throughout the series, Taffer has walked out of a bar without rescuing it three times. = O'Face Bar = Taffer's first walkout was the trailer-themed O'Face Bar in Council Bluffs, Iowa in the season 3 \\"Punch Drunk and Trailer Trashed\\" episode. The owners, Matt and Karen, named the bar after a vulgar expression and engaged in terrible behavior to their staff. In one of Bar Rescue's most infamous moments, Matt and Karen responded to a staff member fight by firing the victim, bartender Cerissa, instead of its instigator, manager Amanda, (as Jon demanded), because they liked Amanda more. Jon was infuriated and almost left on the spot. The owners made amends by firing Amanda and apologizing to Cerissa, but this cost a day of training. Their treatment of customers was little better. Matt refused to give customers the recipe to their signature O'Gasm shot and bartender Dave was irresponsible with fire. After an abysmal stress test, they wasted still more time by bickering and family drama. Karen blamed security guard Syck, one of the bar's only decent people, for shortcomings. Karen also had a drinking problem and carried her own bell to ring when she wanted more alcohol. (The entire staff drank at work, but not to the extremes Karen displayed). She had a lousy attitude, refused to accept personal responsibility and habitually blamed Matt, who in turn berated anyone who snapped at her. Yet another memorable scene showed the staff and owners occupied with arguing in the backroom instead of training, while Jon and his experts waited in vain at the bar. Jon had to go in the back room, break up the fight and list each action that resulted in his decision to declare their bar unworthy of rescue. The final straw for Jon was his background check of the staff, which exposed evidence of criminal acts, a video of Matt slapping Dave and offering Syck a raise to throw him through a window. Matt showed no remorse. Jon refused to involve himself with, or risk his reputation, for people with such a lack of morals and professionalism. He refused to rescue their bar and walked out, telling Matt and Karen that they needed psychiatric help and marriage counseling more than they needed a bar rescue. An incensed Matt yelled at Syck while the latter gave his final thoughts. Syck was later fired and Amanda rehired. In a follow-up episode of \\"Back to the Bar\\", Jon learned that the bar's owners had remodeled it, but its negative depiction and dreadful brand identity were unchanged. Drink and food sales were unimproved, although Matt displayed promise by removing a regular who acted inappropriately toward a female spy. = Return to Second Base = Jon's second walkout occurred in the season 4 \\"Second Base, Third Strike\\" episode. This began as a planned re-rescue of baseball-themed Second Base in Orange, California, (the prior episode \\"Bikini Bust\\", when it was called Extremes Sports Bar). At first Gary, who was promoted to manager at the end of \\"Bikini Bust\\", appeared to be at fault because he did not seem to do his job and blamed successful bars nearby for stealing customers. At one point Gary became so agitated he pushed down a retaining wall. Instead Jon discovered that owner Terry didn't give his staff tools or funds required to operate his bar, constantly replaced old bartenders with new ones he didn't even meet and abandoned Jon's menu and uniform changes. Terry invested all of Second Base's funds into a (supposedly) more successful new bar instead of making improvements or even covering basic operating expenses for Second Base. He refused to listen to criticism and badmouthed Jon and his expert Lisamarie Joyce. Despite this he still expected Jon to come in and save his bar again without personal effort. Jon, with his characteristic insistence on owner responsibility, had no intentions of cooperating with this notion. After a stress test which Jon deemed one of the worst he has ever seen, he gave Terry an ultimatum: he would re-remodel the bar, but only if Terry put up $30,000 of the expense himself. Terry now claimed his new bar lacked enough success to support Second Base and refused. Angry, disgusted and disappointed because one of his favorite bar concepts ever had been ruined, Jon called Terry a slime bucket and departed. Terry's final excuse to Jon was that he would‚Äôve agreed to contribute to the new remodel if he had the money, to which Jon replied to Terry that he would‚Äôve had the money if he ran Second Base the right way. Jon did, however, promise to assist Second Base's staff in finding new jobs. = Black Light District = Jon's third walkout was the punk rock-themed Black Light District in Long Beach, California in season 4's \\"Drunk on Punk\\" episode. Owner Dave refused to accept any changes to the building, drink menu, or music choices. He would only play punk rock, deeming anything else as \\"selling out.\\" He made it clear he'd rather have his bar close than play another genre. He displayed an immense ego, going so far as to insult customers who criticized the music along with Jon and mixologist Phil Wills. He sneered at Phil's attempt to prepare a fruit-based drink menu that sold well at other music-themed bars. The Vandals bassist Joe Escalante, who acted as a recon spy, pointed out that as much as he himself loved punk rock, it was a specialized genre unlikely to keep a bar in business by itself. Instead of finding fault with Escalante's knowledge or logic, Dave chose to respond with a personal attack. He mocked Escalante's \\"grandpa sweater\\" and implied that the 35-year veteran of the punk scene was too old to \\"get\\" punk. The insulted bassist departed from the episode. The only change Dave was interested in was the addition of a kitchen. Jon found this ludicrous since Dave couldn't even run a bar right. Dave's bar was filthy and he proved more of a hindrance than help during Stress Test. When Dave told Jon to his face to leave, insisting he knew better, Jon happily complied. The staff, especially jilted investor Gabe, was dismayed by Dave's apathetic attitude and the hope Jon took away with him. Legal issues =Lawsuit= Jon and Nicole Taffer, along with the show's production company Bongo LLC, have been sued by Dr. Paul T. Wilkes from Bar 702 (formerly Sand Dollar). In episode \\"Don't Mess with Taffer's Wife\\", Wilkes is shown to hit on Nicole, and Jon yells at him in retaliation. However, Wilkes stated that the producers ordered him to be sleazy and make offensive comments on women, and texted him to \\"Hit on Mrs. Taffer hardcore!!\\" After Wilkes did so, Wilkes states that Taffer called the control room to tell them to have a drink near the spot where he intended to confront Wilkes, so he could throw it in his face, and said to a colleague, \\"Now I'm going to show you why my show is Number One.\\" According to Wilkes, Taffer came in to confront him and showed him footage of his audition tapes, in which he insulted the way Taffer dressed. Taffer then physically assaulted Wilkes, leading to a scuffle, resulting in a hyperventilating Taffer collapsing onto the floor. Wilkes stated that he suffered from emotional distress and symptoms such as migraines, nausea, vomiting, night terrors, crying spells, severe depression, and anxiety attacks as a result of the confrontation. As of August 11, 2017, the case was dismissed with prejudice at the request of Dr. Wilkes after it settled in arbitration for a confidential amount. As a result, the \\"Don't Mess with Taffer's Wife\\" episode no longer airs in reruns on Paramount Network or appears on the network's website and apps. =Nashville rescue/Wayne Mills murder= During the taping for season 3, Taffer visited BoondoxXx BBQ & Juke Joint in Nashville, Tennessee and worked with owner Chris Ferrell, who was noted for having a hot temper. The rescued bar was renamed Pit & Barrel and the episode featuring the bar was to air on November 24, 2013, but on the night before the episode was supposed to air, Ferrell was arrested by Nashville police for shooting and killing country singer Wayne Mills during an argument inside the remodeled Pit & Barrel. Spike immediately pulled the episode from its originally scheduled premiere slot in primetime. However, it failed to remove the episode replay carried three hours later at 1 a.m. ET/10 p.m. PT from its broadcast automation system, thus it still aired. The network drew criticism for the error, in light of the circumstances. Since the accidental airing, the episode has never re-aired, though it has been distributed on file-sharing websites. Ferrell stood trial for the murder of Mills and asserted he acted in self-defense, claiming that Mills had violated the bar's nonsmoking rule and had threatened to kill him with a broken beer bottle. The jury convicted Ferrell of second-degree murder in March 2015 after a long-delayed trial, and he was given a 20-year sentence without the possibility of parole. The verdict and sentence are being appealed. Series overview International broadcast In the UK, the show airs on 5*, starting from January 8, 2014.

The stone, erected before 1866, marked the border between the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick. Originally this spot was a tripoint. During the division of Germany the border between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany ran past the Dreieckiger Pfahl. Today it marks the border between the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony, the post lying just within the Lower Saxon side. During the Cold War it was accessible from the west. The historic stone stands at an elevation of about 870 metres, around 2.5 kilometres east of a car park on the B 4 federal road between Torfhaus and Oderbr√ºck. The first recorded mention of a boundary stone being located here dates to the year 1727. On a map of the Upper Forest of Braunlage (Oberforst Braunlage) is the note \\"drey Eckjer Pfahl anno 1698\\". From a description of the Harzburg Forest (Harzburger Forsten) the original stone is described thus: ...which translates roughly as... The boundary markers were subsequently replaced on a regular basis. In 1736 a wooden post was erected and, in 1791, one made of stone. In 1844 a new post was made in oakwood. The present triangular stone was erected before 1866. It bears the No. 1 and, on its northeastern and southwestern sides the letters KH for Kingdom of Hanover, and on the southeastern side the letters HB for the Duchy of Brunswick (Herzogtum Braunschweig). The original triangular shape was retained. In 1894 a railway station was planned at the site of the Dreieckiger Pfahl. Engineer Louis Degen, who had drawn up plans for a Harz railway running on the territory of Brunswick from Walkenried via Wieda to Braunlage (later called the South Harz Railway), envisaged an extension of the line to the most northerly point of this piece of Brunswick terrain ‚Äì the district of Blankenburg. Previously, in 1892, the construction of a road requested by several parishes in the West Harz, which would have branched off at the Dreieckiger Pfahl from the road from Torfhaus/Oderbr√ºck to Schierke and run to the Brocken Road, had been refused by the Chamber of the Principality of Stolberg-Wernigerode. The station was to have been equipped with a run-around loop. However the railway was only built as far as Braunlage. A goods track ran to the north of Braunlage to the granite quarry on the Wurmberg mountain. But it never reached the Dreieckiger Pfahl. Until 1945 there was a small restaurant at the Dreieckiger Pfahl, which was mainly frequented by hikers to the Brocken. The building was burnt down by American troops in April 1945, because SS and Wehrmacht soldiers as well as Hitler Youth had been hiding in huts in this area. The pub was never rebuilt. Today, there is a rest area for hikers and mountain bikers in the vicinity of the Dreieckiger Pfahl as well as box no. 168 on the Harzer Wandernadel network of hiking checkpoints.

He was killed in a shooting accident on board a train. Family and education Jones was born in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of William Jones of Lochmaben. He was educated at Oswestry School where he became the first pupil to be awarded a scholarship. In 1872, he went up to Brasenose College, Oxford where he was a \\"brilliant scholar\\" attaining first class honours degrees in Mathematics in 1875 and Natural Sciences in 1876. Football career Whilst at university, Jones played \\"soccer\\" and was described in one match report as \\"an admirable centre player\\". In January 1877, he played for North Wales in a match against Sheffield in which his performance earned him a call-up to the Wales team for their international match against Scotland on 5 March 1877. The two countries had met for the first time a year earlier in Partick, Glasgow; the second international meeting between the two countries was played at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham and was thus the first international football match played in Wales. Despite \\"the Welsh team (playing) more brilliantly than ever before\\", they lost 2‚Äì0. He played a match for Shrewsbury Town in January 1878. Later career and death In May 1877, Jones became a master at Clifton College, Bristol. Whilst at the college he joined the 2nd Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteer Corps, being promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant in January 1878. A month later, on 16 February 1878, he was in charge of a party from the Clifton College Cadet Corps who had been practising at the firing range at Avonmouth. In the evening, the party returned by train from Avonmouth to Hotwells, close to the college. At Sea Mills, one of the cadets, Edward George Hemming (the son of an eminent barrister), was demonstrating the poor technique of another cadet by waving his Snider-Enfield rifle around when the rifle, which had not been unloaded, discharged. The bullet went through the compartment wall hitting Jones, killing him instantly. At the coroner's inquest on 18 February, the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, summing up: > In a case like this one could not help feeling deep sympathy with the family > of the deceased but he could not help thinking that they should extend their > sympathy to the young man who had been the innocent cause of the death of > this young officer. Memorials Jones is commemorated with a memorial window at Oswestry school and a brass plaque in the ante-chapel at Clifton College: > In memory of Alexander Fletcher Jones, B.A. > A Master in this College, Who was killed by the accidental discharge of a > rifle at Sea Mills, February 16th, 1878, Aged 24 years. > \\"Peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good > fruits.\\" ‚Äî Jas. iii. 17.

The venue is the Royal Plaza at Bangkok, Thailand, in front of the Dusit Palace and its Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Introduction All three branches of the armed forces take part in the parade, as seen in the composition of the Massed Military Bands, Bugle Squads and the Colour Parties of the 13 military units participating. The parade is notable for the colourful uniforms on display; pith helmets with heavy plumes resembling bearskins are worn, except for the lone cavalry unit in attendance - with British-style cavalry helmets and Thai lances on horsebacks - and the Naval Cadets. These uniforms are a nod to the British military traditions in the Royal Thai Armed Forces since the time of King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) in the final years of the 19th century, with a combination of the British and German military drill and ceremonial. The general public also attend the parade celebrations, and Thai television stations broadcast this to the entire nation. Of the 13 participating battalions most are from the Royal Thai Army with two battalions, one each from the Royal Thai Navy and Royal Thai Marine Corps and another two battalions coming from the Royal Thai Air Force; all in full dress uniforms. Of all of them, most are active military units, the rest are military academies of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, represented by cadet battalions of the academies themselves led by their commandants. The tradition started in 1953 by King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), as a simple colours ceremony for the new colours of the 1st Infantry Regiment, King's Own Bodyguard and has now grown into a national military tradition through the years. Since 2009, however, Trooping the Colours is not held, however the oath taking part of the ceremony is retained, plus the ceremonial march-in and march-out of the troops and the Massed Bands, the Royal Salutes and the Royal 21-Gun Salute. The parade itself came back in 2014 after a 5-year break, but this time before the King's birthday celebrations. History of the ceremonial parade On Dec. 5, 1953, the 1st Inf. Regiment The King's Guards of the Royal Thai Army received their Colours from King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in his capacity as Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, in Bangkok, and trooped it in his presence, thus beginning this national military tradition. This has now grown from being a purely infantry activity to becoming an Armed Forces-wide celebration over the years, with the original unit now being joined by 12 other units representing the Royal Thai Armed Forces. They form the Thai counterpart to the British Household Division: 14 foot units and 1 to 2 mounted units parade past the Royal Family on that day, 3 from the military academies of the RTAF and the rest from units within the Armed Forces.

In patients with severe lung hyperinflation, IPPB may decrease dyspnea and discomfort during nebulized therapy.  Contraindications  Most contraindications are relative, such as nausea, hemodynamic instability, tracheal fistula, singulation and hemoptysis.

Founded by Nicholas White in 2011, The Daily Dot is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The site, conceived as the Internet's \\"hometown newspaper\\", focuses on topics such as streaming entertainment, geek culture, memes, gadgets and social issues, such as LGBT, gender and race. In addition, an e-commerce arm produces branded video for advertisers and sells items from an online marketplace. History The Daily Dot was established in 2011 by Nicholas White, whose goal was to cover Internet communities such as Reddit and Tumblr in the same manner as hometown newspapers cover their own communities. White's family has been in the newspaper business since buying the Sandusky Register in Ohio in 1869, and White was a reporter and executive with the family's media company before establishing the site. White launched The Daily Dot with $600,000 and a handful of full-time reporters. Many of the site's early stories were filed to a Google Doc and reported on Facebook and Twitter. After establishing a headquarters in Austin, Texas, the company added other offices but many staff worked remotely from other locations. It raised a $10 million private investment to add staff, produce digital content and develop its internal creative agency in 2015, ramping up its output to 50-70 stories a day. Its coverage has focused on \\"under-reported\\" areas while emphasizing progressive issues such as body-positivity and feminism. White has also highlighted the need to diversify his staff. \\"Journalism has been dominated by a few select types of voices. We have an opportunity to break from that cycle,\\" he has said. The Daily Dot has pursued several content strategies while building its online presence. In 2012, it was one of the first major sites to launch dedicated esports coverage. In 2016, the company sold that section, Dot Esports, to Gamurs, an Australian esports multimedia operation. In 2014, it purchased The Kernel, a competing website, and turned it into a weekly Sunday edition featuring long-form editorial built around a single theme. The Kernel founder and editor-in-chief Milo Yiannopoulos stepped down following the acquisition. The Kernel ceased regular publication in 2016. It also has collaborated on video projects with partners including HLN, on a co-branded series called Next Sex; the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for which it produced a public service announcement encouraging vaccination featuring Sesame Street character Elmo and former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy; and television cooking personality Alton Brown, which has garnered more than 6.7 million views on YouTube. In January 2016, the site launched VIP Voices, a collection of op-eds from high-profile contributors on Internet issues in public discourse. Contributors include Mayor Bill de Blasio, Representative Ted Lieu, and Senator Mike Lee. In 2018, The Daily Dot sued the New York Police Department to access handgun license applications filed by Donald Trump and two of his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. The suit alleges that the NYPD declined a request made by The Daily Dot under New York's Freedom of Information Law to release the information, citing privacy and safety concerns; the site argues the information should be public. The company had a full-time staff of 76, in addition to 222 freelance contributors, in early 2016 before laying off 40% of its total staff in September 2016. White, who called the layoff a \\"restructuring\\", said the move was necessary to refocus resources on growing areas such as video, e-commerce and sales. The site's e-commerce videos, produced in conjunction with advertisers, are shared on Facebook and generate revenue by sharing a portion of sales. In addition, the site has built two online storefronts, the Bazaar and The Daily Dot Store, on which it sells items. Coverage and awards The Daily Dot's coverage is split into several sections: *Debug - covers gadgets, platforms and software; *IRL - covers topics including gender, LGBT issues and sex; *Layer 8 - covers topics such as Internet rights, cybercrime, information security and other issues; *Parsec - focuses on gaming, science, comics, fashion and nostalgia; *Unclick - devoted to memes and other Internet topics; *Upstream - devoted to streaming entertainment. The site's coverage has been recognized by the following outlets: 2017, finalist, CJ Affiliate CJ You Innovator of the Year Award. 2016, finalist, The Webby Awards, Best Individual Performance in Online Film and Video (for Alton Brown collaboration). 2016, finalist, Digiday Publisher of the Year and Best Native Advertising. 2015, cited among works of outstanding journalism by The Atlantic for \\"How to Destroy an American Family\\", which chronicled the toll of continued cyberattacks on an Illinois family. In 2015, finalist, Digiday Publisher of the Year, for its investigation of a data breach at global intelligence firm Stratfor. 2015, honoree, The Webby Awards, Websites-News.

The goddess is also supposed to be the special guardian of the Cauvery embankment here. The river takes an awkward turn just here, and the villagers say that there is a considerable danger of inundation. The goddess is the recipient of numerous vows from the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring taluks, especially on the 18th of Adi (July‚ÄìAugust), the Padinettam perukka day. A bank runs south from the river at this point and is said to have been erected to mark the boundary of the Chola and Chera kingdoms.\\"Hemingway, F. R. Trichinopoly. Madras District Gazetteers.

The occurring problems from EPPPs are in parallel explained under environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). The European Union summarizes pharmaceutical residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil together with other micropollutants under ‚Äúpriority substances‚Äù.DIRECTIVE 2013/39/EU of 12 August 2013 amending Directives 2000/60/EC and 2008/105/EC as regards priority substances in the field of water policy Pharmaceutical drugs have various known and unknown effects on the environment. Background Pharmaceuticals comprise one of the few groups of chemicals that are specifically designed to act on living cells, which presents a special risk when they enter, persist and are dispersed into the environment. With exception for downstream sewage treatment plants, the concentration of pharmaceuticals in water is probably extremely low. However, the effect that the chronic exposure to environmental pharmaceuticals chemicals adds to the effects of other chemicals in the cocktail is still not studied. The different chemicals might be potentiating synergistic effects (1+1=3). An extremely sensitive group in this respect are foetuses. EPPPs are already found in water all over the world. The diffuse exposure might contribute to * extinction of species and imbalance of sensible ecosystems, as many EPPPs affect the reproductive systems of for example frogs, fish and mussels; * genetic, developmental, immune and hormonal health effects to humans and other species, in the same way as e.g. oestrogen-like chemicals; * development of microbes resistant to antibiotics, as is found in India. = Environmental classification of pharmaceuticals = In Sweden, the industry together with universities and health care sector has developed a method for environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs.Gunnarsson B, Wennmalm √Ö. (2006) Environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs. In: Environment and Pharmaceuticals. Stockholm: Apoteket AB, 2006Environmentally Classified Pharmaceuticals 2011 . Stockholm: Stockholm County Council, 2011 Environmental risk refers to the risk of toxicity to the aquatic environment. It is based on the ratio between predicted environmental concentration of the substance (PEC) and the highest concentration of the substance that does not have a harmful effect in the environment (PNEC). Environmental hazard expresses the inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of the substance in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The toxicity tests used are acute toxicity of fish, acute toxicity of Daphnia sp. and growth inhibition test of algae. Most medications on the Swedish market are now classified. This gives the health care possibilities to make better choices when prescribing medicines. =Exposure= Concentrations in surface waters, groundwater and partially treated water are typically less than 0.1 ¬µg/l (or 100 ng/l), and concentrations in treated water are generally below 0.05 ¬µg/l (or 50 ng/l).(ny 8 WHO) However, all water on the earth is part of the same stable pool, and as larger amounts of pharmaceuticals are consumed, there is a risk that the concentration of pharmaceuticals in drinking water will increase. =Release into the environment= Pharmaceuticals reach the environment mainly in three ways: *They are excreted from humans and animals, intact or metabolized, mainly into the urine, passing on to the environment directly or via sewage treatment plants. *Unused pharmaceuticals reach the environment either via household wastewater or via urban solid garbage handling. *Manufacturing plants producing the active substances might unintentionally release pharmaceuticals into the environment. Due to improved measurement methods pharmaceuticals may be detected today in concentrations that probably have been present already for decades but could not be measured before. Many pharmaceuticals are (after consumption) excreted or washed off: investigations have shown excretion rates between 30% and 70% of orally taken substancesEco- directed sustainable prescribing: feasibility for reducing water contamination by drugs, 2014 and even higher rates considering externally applied ointments or gel.BIO Intelligence Service (2013), Study on the environmental risks of medicinal products, Final Report prepared for Executive Agency for Health and Consumers‚Äù Some pharmaceuticals are degraded to various extents in sewage treatment plants, but others leave the plant in active forms. Active residues of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface water, and they may persist in the environment for long periods of time. Large amounts of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals have been found downstream from sewage treatment plants in sub catchments where the discharge of hospital waste water plays a major role noPILLS in waters, 2015 or in catchments with pharmaceutical industries. EPPPs from treated sewage sludge used as fertilizer are absorbed by soya, and antibiotics have been found in the leaves. Drinking water There are various pathways how pharmaceutical substances may enter drinking water. Predominantly, drinking water procurement comes from drinking water reservoirs, groundwater and bank filtration. If treated waste water is discharged in catchments with drinking water procurement the not eliminated pharmaceutical substances may be detected in the drinking water. The Netherlands for example gain 37% of their drinking water from surface water, mainly from bank filtration at Rhine and Meuse. Here certain attention is paid to pharmaceutical residues. In Germany drinking water catchments and rivers EPPPs have been detected already, especially radiocontrast agents.Regionaler Themenbericht des Landes Niedersachsen Arznei- und R√∂ntgenkontrastmittelr√ºckst√§nde im Grundwasser Moreover, pharmaceutical residues here partly have their origin in agriculture.Bayerisches Landesamt f√ºr Umwelt An evaluation of the German Federal Environment Agency of regional investigations carried out between 2009 and 2011 showed in total 27 different pharmaceutical substances in concentrations of more than 0.1 microgram per litre in German surface waters and up to 150 substances have been detected in total. Besides the radiocontrast agents especially the painkiller diclofenac showed relevant concentrations.Hintergrundpapier des Umweltbundesamtes, 2014 For many micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals no threshold values in drinking water purification or waste water treatment are obligatory by now as the knowledge about effects is lacking or insufficiently proven.German Federal Environment Agency \\"Arzneimittel und Umwelt\\" Some of these environmental pharmaceuticals chemicals are well known to have serious genotoxic effects in humans. Half-life in nature varies depending on the environment (air, water, soil, sludge), but is more than one year for several compounds.Tysklind M et al. (2006) The spread of drugs in soil and water. In: Environment and Pharmaceuticals. Stockholm: Apoteket AB.Westerlund E. (2007) Screening of pharmaceuticals in Sk√•ne . L√§nstyrelsen i Sk√•ne l√§n. [In Swedish] Concentrations of EPPPs can vary from 1 ng to 1 mg per litre (2). Serious effects of EPPPs on water-living organisms, especially on reproductive systems, have been already shown, as well as on microbial communities.Larsson J et al. (2006) Hormones and endocrine-disrupting substances in the environment. In: Environment and Pharmaceuticals. Stockholm: Apoteket AB.Pharmaceuticals in the environment. Results of an EEA workshop. (2010) Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. This would be of much less concern if the population were to keep their excrement out of the wastewater via the use of the urine-diverting dry toilet or systems that recycle treated blackwater to flush toilets again indefinitely. Assessment * Pharmaceuticals are special kinds of chemicals. They are manufactured to be biologically active in living organisms. * The levels of pharmaceuticals in surface or drinking water are generally below 1 mg per litre, often measured in ng per litre (2, 8). This low concentration might appear to guarantee that they hardly pose any problem to public health. Assuming a concentration of 100 ng/l of a pharmaceutical that in humans has DDD (defined daily dose) of 10 mg implies that a volume of 100,000 litres would be required to make up one single DDD. Such calculation does not take into account the vulnerable population exposure for example during the period of development. * Therapeutic levels of Levonorgestrel (a sex hormone) has been found in Rainbow trout downstream a sewage treatment plant. Laws and regulations Environmental Pharmaceutical Persistent Pollutants, EPPP, have to be looked at in their entirety of the product chain.Dutch National Institute for Health and the Environment: Pharmaceutical product chain Pharmaceutical residues may enter the environment in various phases and therefore the influence or impact regarding environmental effects can be regulated on different levels: * on the scientific and industrial level of development and production, * on the governmental and administrative level of authorization, market regulation and legislation, * on the level of health insurances and their influence on production and consumption, * on the distribution level with physicians and their prescriptions respectively in pharmacies and stores, * on the level of patients with individual consumption pattern, disposal behavior etc. and finally * in the field of waste management, waste water treatment and drinking water supply. Pharmaceuticals differ from other anthropogenic chemicals with respect to legal requirements and depending on the countries and cultural frame. Partly they are excluded in laws and regulations which control manufacture, marketing, use, and disposal of other consumer products of a chemical character (solvents, paints, glues etc.). As a consequence the possible negative environmental impact of pharmaceuticals may be less documented, in comparison to other consumer chemicals. = Laws and regulations in the European Union = In the European Union (EU) today more than 3,000 pharmaceutical substances are approved.PILLS project report, 2012 In 2013 the EU started initiatives to address to the task of pharmaceutical residues in the water cycle. Here the Commission was proposing to add 15 chemicals to the watch list of substances in the Water Framework Directive (WFD)EU Water Framework Directive webpage that are monitored and controlled in EU surface waters, including 3 pharmaceuticals (besides industrial chemicals, substances used in biocides and plant protection products): ‚ÄúThe contamination of water and soil with pharmaceutical residues is an emerging environmental concern. In evaluating and controlling the risk to, or via, the aquatic environment from medicinal products, adequate attention should be paid to Union environmental objectives. In order to address that concern, the Commission should study the risks of environmental effects from medicinal products and provide an analysis of the relevance and effectiveness of the current legislative framework in protecting the aquatic environment and human health via the aquatic environment.‚Äù The two hormones estradiol and ethinylestradiol and the painkiller diclofenac are present on the list since 2013 and in 2015 three macrolide antibiotics were added, too.EC IMPLEMENTING DECISION establishing a watch list of substances for Union-wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to Directive 2008/105/EC, 2015. In 2018, due to \\"sufficient high-quality monitoring data are available for the substances tri-allate, oxadiazon, 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol and diclofenac, those substances should be removed from the watch list\\" and that \\"new ecotoxicological information for the macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin and azithromycin, for methiocarb, and for the neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam, which led it to revise the predicted no-effect concentrations for those substances\\". The objective of the implementation of the WFD watch list is to update the available information on the fate of the listed substances in the aquatic environment and consequently, to support a more detailed environmental risk assessment. A preparatory‚Äústudy on the environmental risks of medicinal products‚Äù was commissioned by the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers and published in December 2013. This ‚ÄúBIO IS study‚Äù discusses a wide range of legislative and non-legislative ‚Äúfactors of influence‚Äù and related possible solutions. According to the 2013 Directive ‚Äúthe Commission shall [‚Ä¶until September 2015] develop a strategic approach to pollution of water by pharmaceutical substances. That strategic approach shall, where appropriate, include proposals enabling, to the extent necessary, the environmental impacts of medicines to be taken into account more effectively in the procedure for placing medicinal products on the market. In the framework of that strategic approach, the Commission shall, where appropriate, by 14 September 2017 propose measures to be taken at Union and / or Member State level, as appropriate, to address the possible environmental impacts of pharmaceutical substances [‚Ä¶] with a view to reducing discharges, emissions and losses of such substances into the aquatic environment, taking into account public health needs and the cost effectiveness of the measures proposed.‚Äù Beyond the precautionary approach the EU was already aiming at proper disposal practices since 2004. An EU directive for human pharmaceuticals explicitly requires that all member states should establish collection systems for unused or expired medicines. Such systems were already in use in several member states at the time the legislation went into action in 2004.EU DIRECTIVE 2004/27/EC amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use The disposal regulations in the EU member states are still rather different, ranging from recommendations to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste that goes nearly completely to incineration (Germany)Recommendations of the Federal Ministry of Health, Germany 2015 with temperatures usually between 900 ¬∞C - 1.300 ¬∞CGerman association of thermal waste treatment, 2015 to collection systems where leftovers are considered to be ‚Äúhazardous waste‚Äù (Luxembourg).Program Superdreckskescht Luxembourg, 2015 In France, the Cyclamed take-back programwebpage of the French cyclamed take-back program enables people to bring back unused or expired pharmaceuticals back to the pharmacies. Wrong disposal via sink or toilet and hereby to the wastewater system still seems to be a problem in many EU member states: investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least ‚Äúrarely‚Äù via the toilet or sink. This is one of the aspects considered in the above-mentioned EU strategic approaches. Moreover, regarding the market authorization for pharmaceuticals approved for marketing in the EU before 2006 the environmental assessment criteria have been different. In case the active substance of a human medicinal product today is assessed to be a hazardous substance or assessed to pose a risk to the environment: no refusal of the product is possible, even though in 2012 about 1,200 pharmaceutical substances were identified to be potentially relevant for an environmental monitoring.Nicole Adler, German Federal Environment Agency, 2015 Effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment =Estradiol (estrogen, synthetic hormone)= Concentrations in surface water alone are not sufficient to assess the risk of negative environmental effects in the aquatic environment. Synthetic hormones are endocrine disruptors. Thus, estrogenic compounds like ethinylestradiol (estrogen hormone) at concentrations < 1 ng per litre may cause both vitellogenin production (a frequently used index for feminization of male fish), and structural change in their sex organs. It has also been demonstrated that fish exposed to sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent can take up and concentrate estrogenic compounds, including ethinylestradiol, to very high internal levels. These observations on feminization of fish by estrogenic compounds in STP effluents have been observed in many countries, and have also been observed in other species, like frogs, alligators and molluscs. =Cardiovascular medicines= Other examples of environmental impact in the aquatic environment of human medication concern both cardiovascular and neuro-psychiatric medicines. The non-selective beta- blocking agent Propanolol was found to cause a significant decrease in egg production in Medaka fish, at a concentration close to that demonstrated in the sewage treatment plants (STP) effluents. Gemfibrozil (cholesterol and triglycerides lowering drug) often appears in the effluent from STPs. At concentrations close to those reported in STP effluent, Gemfibrozil lowers the blood levels of testosterone in fish. =Citalopram / Fluoxetine (serotonin reuptake inhibitor anti depressants, SSRIs)= Some SSRIs have been shown to accumulate in exposed fish. Citalopram has been detected in liver from wild perch in low ¬µg per kg levels, and fluoxetine affects the serotonin system in the same way that it does in humans. Fluoxetine has also been shown to affect swimming activity in shellfish; whether this is linked to a disturbance of serotonin function in the brain is still unknown. =Antibiotics= High levels of antibiotics in the water are a cause for alarm as there is an increased risk of selecting resistant bacteria, an issue of global concern. This can lead to some highly effective antibiotics becoming ineffective. There are several examples: In India, bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin have been found downstream pharmaceutical plants, genes for multi resistance were found in drinking water, and multi resistant Salmonella in water sprayed on vegetables. From Europe we know about the epidemic with multi resistant EHEC in summer 2011, originating from water sprayed vegetables. The term \\"eco- shadow\\" has been introduced to describe the ecological impact of antibiotics. Antibiotics with a wide spectrum that are also stable will have a greater impact on the bacterial flora (a long eco-shadow) than those with a narrow antibacterial spectrum which disintegrates more rapidly (a short eco-shadow). The ecological effects of tetracyclines and quinolones have been observed. They are not metabolized in the human body and are therefore excreted unmodified. When entered into the environment they are poorly degraded. They can be toxic to other animals, affecting particularly microorganism and fish. In the effluent from a sewage treatment plant in India, several broad spectrum antibiotics were found in concentrations toxic to bacteria and plants. In the sewage treatment plant itself, there were enterococcae resistant to all known antibiotics. The development of resistant bacteria in sewage treatment plants is stimulated by high concentration of antibiotics (e.g. in plant sewage), large amounts of bacteria (e.g. from human sewage water that is added in plant sewage), and selection of Information that can be used to assess the nominated issue have been observed. Gaps in knowledge Effective environmental detection methods have to be developed and global detection strategy applied to map the current global situation. There are currently no test methods to assess whether negative effects may occur after long-term environmental diffuse exposure in humans, during the vulnerable periods of development, on aquatic micro-organism or how it may affect other animals. Therefore, the precautionary principle must be guiding. Concentrations in surface water alone are not sufficient to assess the risk of negative environmental effects of these synthetic chemicals. Consideration must be taken to bio-accumulation in fish and other aquatic food used by humans, as well as to additive and synergetic effects between pharmaceutical and other chemicals in the contaminated water. In a small study, several pharmaceuticals were found in milk of goat, cow and human. More research is needed to find out how common this is, the concentrations and the sources.

It aired alongside \\"Tech Support\\" on November 3, 2011 on MTV. Plot Beavis and Butt- Head watch a black-and-white TV show in which one of the characters asks for the hand of someone's daughter. Beavis and Butt-Head do not understand that this meant that he wanted to marry her, and they get the idea to ask someone for his daughter's \\"hand\\". They go to a house where a girl named Victoria lives and asks her dad for her \\"hand\\", but he says that she is a few years older than them and already has a boyfriend. Beavis and Butt-Head, not understanding, ask him again and the man responds by saying that they would have to wait a long time if they want a chance with his daughter. After he ends the conversation and closes the door, the duo sits on the sidewalk, thinking that the man meant they only had to wait for hours or days. Their neighbor, Tom Anderson, is close by in his yard raking leaves and is interrupted by the duo's conversation. Butt-Head says that they are waiting to have Victoria's \\"hand\\" and Mr. Anderson says to them that only one of them can have her \\"hand\\", thinking that she is still single and not realizing what they really mean, adding that they should just get up and get her \\"hand\\". The duo then goes back to the man's door to ask him for his daughter's \\"hand\\" yet again, but this time he says that he does not think she would want to date or marry either one of them. After they repeat the request, the man begins to realize that what they want his daughter to do. Enraged, the man attacks Beavis and Butt-Head. The two are still asking for her hand. Suddenly, Mr. Anderson intervenes and tells the man to get his hands off of them, and the neighbor tells him to shut up and get lost. They start attacking each other after Mr. Anderson hits him on the head with his rake, which leads the neighbor to knock Anderson to the ground and then punch him numerous times in the face. During the fight, Beavis and Butt-Head realize that they have their own hands to use and don't need Victoria, or any other woman, to satisfy their needs.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, the couple were among Denmark's predominant designers, active the areas of architecture, furniture design, silverware and textiles. Early life Much of Kindt-Larsen's success is due to collaboration with his wife Tove whom he married in 1937. Both had studied under Kaare Klint at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the late 1920s. Working as a team, they exhibited a high sense of quality and appreciation of current trends. Furniture They specialized in furniture design, presenting their work at the annual exhibitions of the Cabinetmakers Guild, organised by Edvard from 1943 to 1966. Their pieces for factory production were rather simple in design but they also designed more elaborate individual pieces. Kindt-Larsen was fascinated by the idea of contrasts, as can be seen in his furniture where he often combined glossy painted surfaces with untreated wood or simply used several different kinds of wood for a given item.\\"Edvard Lindt-Larsen\\" , Georg Jensen. Retrieved 11 November 2011. Other areas of design The couple also designed home textiles for Gabriel in Fredericia and silverware for A. Michelsen.

P.863http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.863/en ITU-T Recommendation P.863: Perceptual objective listening quality assessment is an ITU-T Standard that covers a model to predict speech quality by means of analyzing digital speech signals.

The predictions of those objective measures should come as close as possible to subjective quality scores as obtained in subjective listening tests. Usually, a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is predicted. POLQA uses real speech as a test stimulus for assessing telephony networks.  Technology capabilities  POLQA is the successor of PESQ (ITU-T Rec. P.862). POLQA avoids weaknesses of the current P.862 model and is extended towards handling of higher bandwidth audio signals. Further improvements target the handling of time called signals and signals with many delay variations. Similarly to P.862,http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862/en ITU-T Recommendation P.862: Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ): An objective method for end-to-end speech quality assessment of narrow-band telephone networks and speech codecs POLQA supports measurements in the common telephony band (300‚Äì3400 Hz), but in addition it has a second operational mode for assessing HD-Voice in wideband and super-wideband speech signals (50‚Äì14000 Hz). POLQA also targets the assessment of speech signals recorded acoustically by an artificial head with mouth and ear simulators.  Development history  The POLQA activities started in ITU-T in early 2006 under the working title P.OLQA. In mid-2009 a competition was started to evaluate several candidate models. In May 2010 ITU-T selected candidate models from three companies, OPTICOM, SwissQual and Rohde & Schwarz company, and TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research), to form the future Recommendation P.863. The three companies were asked to merge their approaches to one single standardized model. The result is now standardized as POLQA / P.863.  Genealogy of related standards  ITU-T‚Äôs family of full reference objective voice quality measurements started in 1997 with P.861 (PSQM), which was superseded by P.862 (PESQ) in 2001. P.862 was later complemented with the recommendations P.862.1http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862.1/en ITU-T Recommendation P.862.1: Mapping function for transforming P.862 raw result scores to MOS-LQO (mapping of PESQ scores to a MOS scale), P.862.2http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862.2/en ITU-T Recommendation P.862.2: Wideband extension to Recommendation P.862 for the assessment of wideband telephone networks and speech codecs (wideband measurements) and P.862.3http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862.3/en ITU-T Recommendation P.862.3 Application guide for objective quality measurement based on Recommendations P.862, P.862.1 and P.862.2 (application guide). Since 2011 P.863 (POLQA) is in force. Two additional implementer‚Äôs guides for P.863 have been consented by ITU-T Study Group 12 in November 2011. In addition to the above listed full reference methods, the list of ITU-T‚Äôs objective voice quality measurement standards also includes P.563http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.563/en ITU-T Recommendation P.563: Single-ended method for objective speech quality assessment in narrow-band telephony applications (no-reference algorithm).  Testing typology  POLQA, similar to P.862 PESQ, is a Full Reference (FR) algorithm that rates a degraded or processed speech signal in relation to the original signal. It compares each sample of the reference signal (talker side) to each corresponding sample of the degraded signal (listener side). Perceptual differences between both signals are scored as differences. The perceptual psycho-acoustic model is based on similar models of human perception as MP3 or AAC. Basically, the signals are analysed in the frequency domain (in critical bands) after applying masking functions. Unmasked differences between the two signal representations will be counted as distortions. Finally, the accumulated distortions in the speech file are mapped into a 1 to 5 quality scale as usual for MOS tests. FR measurements deliver the highest accuracy and repeatability but can only be applied for dedicated tests in live networks (e.g. drive test tools for mobile network benchmarks). POLQA is a full-reference algorithm and analyzes the speech signal sample-by-sample after a temporal alignment of corresponding excerpts of reference and test signal. POLQA can be applied to provide an end-to-end (E2E) quality assessment for a network, or characterize individual network components. POLQA results principally model mean opinion scores (MOS) that cover a scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent).  Description of the POLQA Algorithm  The inputs to the algorithm are two waveforms represented by two data vectors containing 16 bit PCM samples. The first vector contains the samples of the (undistorted) reference signal, whereas the second vector contains the samples of the degraded signal. The POLQA algorithm consists of a temporal alignment block, a sample rate estimator of a sample rate converter, which is used to compensate for differences in the sample rate of the input signals, and the actual core model, which performs the MOS calculation. In a first step, the delay between the two input signals is determined and the sample rate of the two signals relative to each other is estimated. The sample rate estimation is based on the delay information calculated by the temporal alignment. If the sample rate differs by more than approximately 1%, the signal with the higher sample rate is down sampled. After each step, the results are stored together with an average delay reliability indicator, which is a measure for the quality of the delay estimation. The result from the re- sampling step, which yielded the highest overall reliability, is finally chosen. Once the correct delay is determined and the sample rate differences have been compensated, the signals and the delay information are passed on to the core model, which calculates the perceptibility as well as the annoyance of the distortions and maps them to a MOS scale. A much more detailed and comprehensive description of the algorithm can be found in. The next few sections are only intended to give an overview on the basics of POLQA‚Äôs internal structure. = The Core Model = The main element of the core model is the perceptual model which is calculated four times using different parameters in order to cope with different major distortion types. Those distortion types can be split into additive distortions and subtracted distortions. For both types a further distinction is made between very strong and weaker effects. The inputs to the perceptual models are waveforms and the delay information. The output is the Disturbance Density, which is a measure for the perceptibility of distortions in the signals. The perceptual model for the main branch also produces indicators for Frequency distortions, Noise and Reverberation distortions. A subsequent switch which is triggered by a detector for very strong distortions reduces the four Disturbance Density values down to two, one for added and one for subtracted distortions. So far the Disturbance Density is an indicator for the perceptibility of distortions only and cognitive effects are not yet taken into account. Cognitive aspects are however important when human beings are asked to score the quality of what they can perceive. Essentially they convert the perceptibility measure Disturbance Density into an annoyance measure. This conversion is performed by correcting the Disturbance Density values for situations with: * Significant level variations * Many frame repetitions * Strong timbre * Spectral flatness * Noise switching during speech pauses * Many delay variations * Strong variations of the Disturbance Density over time * Strong variations of the loudness of the signals Two further indicators, one for spectral flatness and one for level variations are also calculated in this step. So far all operations were performed on frames with a duration of approximately 32 and 43ms duration (depending on the sample rate and using an overlap of 50%) and for each Bark band separately. In a final step all indicators are integrated over time and frequency in order to compute the final MOS LQO value.  The Perceptual Model  The key concept inside the perceptual model is Idealisation. The idea behind this is, that POLQA is supposed to simulate Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests. In an ACR test however, subjects have no comparison to the actual reference signal when they score a speech signal. Instead, it is assumed that subjects have an understanding of what an ideal signal sounds like and they use this as their own reference. Consequently, if they are asked to score a reference signal which is not absolutely perfect (e.g. it has the wrong volume or contains too much timbre, noise or reverberation), it will be scored worse than perfect. In its idealization step POLQA therefore corrects small imperfections of the reference signals in order to derive the same ideal reference for the comparison to the degraded signal as human subjects would use in their minds. Similar to the idealization of the reference signal, some distortions present in the degraded signal which are hardly perceptible in an ACR test will be partially compensated (e.g. small pitch shifts, linear frequency distortions). The perceptual model starts with scaling the reference signal to an ideal average active speech level of approximately -26dBov. No such scaling is performed on the degraded signal. It is assumed that any deviation of the level of the degraded signal from the ideal -26dBov is to be scored as a degradation of the signal. Next, the spectra of both signals are computed using an FFT with 50% overlapping frames with a duration of between 32ms and 43ms duration (depending on the sample rate). Subsequently small pitch shifts of the degraded signal will be eliminated (Frequency Dewarping). Now, the spectra will be transformed to a psychoacoustically motivated pitch scale, by combining individual spectral lines (FFT bins) to so-called critical bands. The pitch scale used is similar to the Bark scale with an average resolution of 0.3 Bark per band. The result is the Pitch Power Density. At this stage the first three distortion indicators for frequency response distortions, additive noise and room reverberations are calculated. After this, the excitation of each band is derived. This includes the modeling of masking effects in the frequency as well as in the temporal domain. The result is for each frame of each signal a head-internal representation which indicates roughly how loud each frequency component would be perceived. Now, a further idealization step of the reference signal takes place by filtering out excessive timbre and low level stationary noise. At the same time, linear frequency distortions and stationary noise are partially removed from the degraded signal. A subtraction of the idealized excitations finally leads to the Distortion Density, which is measure for the audibility of distortions.

The expiry of a section 21 notice does not bring a tenancy to its end. The tenancy would only be ended by a landlord obtaining an order for possession from a court, and then having that order executed by a County Court bailiff or High Court enforcement officer. Such an order for possession may not be made to take effect earlier than six months from the beginning of the first tenancy unless the tenancy is a demoted assured shorthold tenancy. If the court is satisfied that a landlord is entitled to possession, it must make an order for possession, for a date no later than 14 days after the making of the order unless exceptional hardship would be caused to the tenant in which case possession may be postponed to a date no later than six weeks after the making of the order. The court has no power to grant any adjournment or stay of execution from enforcement unless the tenant has a disability discrimination, public law or human rights defence, or the case is pending an appeal. Where a landlord is seeking possession on the basis of a section 21 notice where the tenancy is, or where there are successive tenancies on the same terms as, the original tenancy comprised in a written tenancy agreement, the landlord may bring a claim for possession under the accelerated procedure if no other claims are being made at the same time. Unlike a standard possession claim, the accelerated possession version is decided by a judge on paper without a hearing unless the paperwork doesn't appears to be in order, or the tenant has raised an important issue in defence. The mean time between claim for possession under the accelerated procedure being issued at court and eviction in 2019 was 27.4 weeks, with a median of 18.7 weeks.  Background  Security of tenure was first given to tenants of certain dwellings in 1915 by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act as a result of housing shortage caused by World War I. Regulations on security were variously widened and tightened over the years. The Rent Act 1977 and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 consolidated existing legislations and is still in force . Tenants of regulated tenancies under the Rent Act 1977 cannot be evicted by their landlord without one of the grounds under Schedule 15 of the Act being satisfied. Notably, grounds for possession resulting from tenant's rent arrears is only a discretionary ground, meaning the court will only grant an order for possession if it considers it reasonable to do so. The Housing Act 1988 introduced assured tenancies and assured shorthold tenancies from 15 January 1989, the latter being a subset of the former. Like regulated tenancies under the Rent Act 1977, tenants of non-shorthold assured tenancies cannot be evicted without one of the grounds specified under the Act being satisfied, though there is now a mandatory ground for possession for rent arrears. Landlords of tenants with an assured shorthold tenancies however can apply for an order for possession from the court without specifying any reason so long as sufficient notices have been given to their tenants in accordance with section 21 of the 1988 Act. Assured shorthold became the default type of private residential tenancies from the commencement of section 96 of the Housing Act 1996 on 28 February 1997.  Requirements  Section 21 of the 1988 Act provides two different mechanisms under which a landlord can give notice to obtain possession of their property. In either case, since the coming into force of the 1996 Act, the notice must be in writing. An agent of the landlord may give the notice on behalf of the landlord. Where there are joint landlords, the notice may be given by any one of them. Where the occupier tenant holds a sub-tenancy, a superior landlord may not give a valid notice at a time when they are not the direct landlord of the occupier even if the mesne tenancy will have ended by the time the notice expire thus making the sub-tenant a direct tenant of the superior landlord. If the notice is served by a company, then it must be signed or otherwise executed in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. = Subsection (1)(b) = Under subsection (1)(b), the tenant must be given at least two months' notice that the landlord requires possession of the property. Where the tenancy agreement contains a break clause which allows for the tenancy to be determined before the expiry of the fixed term period, a notice under section 21(1)(b) may be sufficient to determine the tenancy under the break clause. The legislation is silent and there is no clear authorities as to whether the notice may expire before the end of the fixed term in the absence of a break clause. Until the Court of Appeal judgment in Spencer v Taylor, it was generally thought that a notice may only be given under subsection (1)(b) during a fixed term tenancy. The judgment clarified that a notice may also be given under the subsection during a statutory periodic tenancy that arise pursuant to section 5 of the 1988 Act on the coming to an end of a fixed term tenancy.  Private registered provider of social housing  If the landlord is a private registered provider of social housing, and the tenancy is for a fixed term of at least two years granted on or after 1 April 2012, then the landlord must have previously given a notice of at least six months that the landlord does not propose to grant the tenant another tenancy on the expiry of the current tenancy, and informing the tenant of how to obtain help or advice about the notice and outlining any obligations the landlord has to provide help or advice. = Subsection (4)(a) = Under subsection (4)(a), the length of the notice must be at least two months. The notice must state that possession of the property is required by virtue of section 21 of the 1988 Act, on a date after which possession is required. The date must be the last day of a period of the tenancy, and cannot be earlier than the earliest day an equivalent common law tenancy may be bought to an end by a notice to quit given on the same date. A notice stating that possession is required on a specific date rather than after the specified date is invalid. The notice does not have to state an actual calendar date. It is sufficient for the notice to be worded with a formula which enables the tenant to work out when the notice expires. Such a formula may be on its own, or used alongside a specific date as a saving formula in case the specific date is not valid. In the latter case, the notice is valid even if the notice give two different dates so long as one of the date is specified as a fall back in case the other date is invalid. = COVID-19 = As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minimum length of notice was temporarily raised from two to three months under section 81 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 for all notices served between 26 March 2020 initially to 30 September 2020. Following a decision by the Master of the Rolls with agreement of the Lord Chancellor, additional restriction came in on 27 March 2020 suspending all new and ongoing housing possession action nationally for 90 days. On 5 June 2020, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Robert Jenrick announced via Twitter that suspension of eviction was to be extended for a further two months. The announced extension was given effect through the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) (Coronavirus) Rules 2020 which continued all new and existing stays until 23 August 2020. Following the direction of the Lord Chancellor on 20 August 2020, the suspension was further extended another four weeks to 20 September 2020. The Welsh Government further increased the minimum length of notice for properties in Wales to six months from 24 July 2020. On 28 August 2020, the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 was laid before parliament raising the minimum length of notice in England also to six months. This change went into effect the following day, to end 31 March 2021. The end date of the temporary extension in Wales was later extended to 31 March 2021 to match.  Property licensing  No section 21 notice may be given if the landlord is required to obtain a licence, whether under a mandatory or additional licensing scheme for a house in multiple occupation or a selective licensing scheme for a designated area, while the property is unlicensed and an application for a licence isn't pending.  Tenancy deposit  The Housing Act 2004 introduced requirements on how a landlord must deal with any tenancy deposit taken in relation to the tenancy. A landlord may only require the payment of money as deposit. No section 21 notice may be given while any property other than money is being held as deposit. No section 21 notice may be given while a deposit is held that is not protected in accordance with an authorised tenancy deposit scheme. For a deposit that was taken between 6 April 2007 and 5 April 2012, the deposit was required to be protected within 14 days beginning with the date on which it was received. The Localism Act 2011 increased the time limit to 30 days starting from 6 April 2012. Additionally, the Localism Act 2011 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitional, Transitory and Saving Provisions) Order 2012 provided for a 30 days amnesty period for existing deposit to be protected if a landlord wasn't already in compliance. As well as protecting the deposit, the landlord must also give information as prescribed by the Housing (Tenancy Deposits) (Prescribed Information) Order 2007 to the tenant and anyone who paid the deposit on behalf of the tenant before a section 21 notice may be given. This information must be given by the landlord. It is not enough for the landlord to show that a tenant are able to obtain the information by their own enquiries. For a deposit that was received from 6 April 2007, if the deposit was not protected in accordance with an authorised scheme by the required time limit, then the landlord must first return the deposit in full to the tenant or with such deductions as are agreed between them before the landlord may give a section 21 notice. Alternatively, a section 21 notice may be given if the tenant or the person who paid the deposit on behalf of the tenant has made an application to the county court against the landlord for a penalty under section 214(1) of the 2004 Act, and the claim has been determined by the court, withdrawn or settled. The requirements to protect the deposit and giving of information applies afresh for every tenancy. Where there are successive tenancies between the same landlord and tenant, the deposit is deemed to have been returned by the landlord to the tenant at the end of the old tenancy and the tenant immediately paying the deposit to the landlord for the new tenancy. From 26 March 2015, if the successive tenancies are for the same or substantially the same property, a landlord is deemed to have complied with the requirements if at the start of a new tenancy the deposit continued to be held in accordance with the same authorised scheme as when the requirements were last complied with by the landlord.  England  = Deregulation Act 2015 = The Deregulation Act 2015 introduced a number of changes imposing new obligations on landlords, failure to comply with which renders any section 21 notices served to be invalid. On commencement, these changes applied to all tenancies which began from 1 October 2015, other than statutory periodic tenancies that came into being pursuant to section 5 of the 1988 Act on or after that date on the coming to an end of a tenancy that was granted before that date. All the changes apart from the requirement for landlords to provide prescribed information applied to all tenancies from 1 October 2018.  Retaliatory eviction  A landlord is prohibited from giving a section 21 notice for six months if they are given an improvement notices under section 11 or 12 of the 2004 Act relating to hazards by the local housing authority, or a notice under section 40(7) of the 2004 Act after taking emergency remedial action. Where a section 21 notice has already been given, and before the notice was given, the tenant made a complaint in writing to the landlord regarding the condition of the property and the landlord did not provide an adequate response or gave the notice following the complaint, the tenant then made a complaint to the local housing authority about the same or substantially the same subject as the original complaint to the landlord, and the authority then served an improvement or emergency remedial action notice on the landlord in response, the section 21 is rendered invalid. A landlord is exempted from this section if the condition that gave rise to the notice by the authority is due to a failure by the tenant to use the property in a tenant-like manner, or at the time of the notice the property is genuinely on the market for sale, or if the landlord is a private registered provider of social housing, or the section 21 notice is given as a result of a mortgagee exercising a power of sale on the mortgagor after a default.  Time limits  The requirement for a notice under subsection 4(a) to expire on the last day of a period of the tenancy is removed. No section 21 notice may be given by a landlord in the first four months of a tenancy. Where there are successive tenancies between the same landlord and tenant for the same or substantially the same property, this prohibition runs from when the original tenancy began. The prohibition does not apply to a statutory periodic tenancy. A section 21 notice is only valid for six months from the notice being given. An exception is where a notice has been given under subsection (4)(a), and the length of the notice is required to be longer than two months under subsection (4)(b), in which case proceedings for an order for possession may not be begun after four months from when the notice expired. Between 29 August 2020 and 31 March 2021, where the minimum notice period was increased to six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the period where the notice remains valid was increased to ten months from the notice being given.  Prescribed form  The Secretary of State may prescribe the form which Section 21 notices must be given. The required form has been prescribed as Form 6A as originally laid out in the Assured Shorthold Tenancy Notices and Prescribed Requirements (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2015. This form replaced the form originally prescribed under the Assured Shorthold Tenancy Notices and Prescribed Requirements (England) Regulations 2015 before it came into effect, as a result of the original containing a significant error regarding how long a notice is valid for. There is disagreement as to whether the prescribed form was required for tenancies granted before 1 October 2015 and associated statutory periodic tenancies. If the requirement applied to the older tenancies, then it came into effect on 1 July 2018. An updated Form 6A was prescribed on 1 June 2019 to coincide with the commencement of the Tenant Fees Act 2019. Without the restriction to its application that was present in the first 2015 Regulations, there are no questions as to its applicability to existing older tenancies. A modified Form 6A was published on the government's website on 26 March 2020 to reflect the longer notice period required under the Coronavirus Act. Since the modified form was not set by either primary or secondary legislation, but simply modified and published on the government's website, it is debatable whether the form as available on the government's website is valid or not, without relying on arguments that the form as published is substantially to the same effect as that prescribed following authorities from Ravenseft Properties Ltd v Hall.  Prescribed legal requirements  No section 21 notice may be given by a landlord while the landlord is in breach of a prescribed requirement relating to the condition of the property, health and safety of the occupiers, and the energy performance of the property. Two requirements have been prescribed under this section for tenancies which began from 1 October 2015, other than statutory periodic tenancies that have been excluded. The first is the requirement under regulation 6(5) of the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 whereby a landlord has to provide an energy performance certificate to the person who ultimately becomes the tenant. Government guidelines published by the Department for Communities and Local Government (as it then was) in December 2017 suggested that an energy performance certificate is not required to be given where the tenancy is for an individual room as the tenancy would not be for a building or a building unit designed or altered for separate use. It is unclear if lack of an energy performance certificate in such a tenancy would invalidate a section 21 notice. The second is the requirements under regulation 36 of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998. These require a landlord of any property with any relevant gas fitting or flue serving such fitting to give a copy of the most recent gas safety certificate to new tenant before they occupy the property, and for a copy of new gas safety certificate to be given to each existing tenant. Where the tenant's right to occupy the property is for a period of at most 28 days or there is no relevant gas appliance in any room occupied by the tenant, the landlord may choose instead to display the certificate in a prominent position in the property alongside a statement that the tenant is entitled to request their own copy of the certificate. The Court of Appeal in Trecarrel House Limited v Rouncefield overturned lower court's judgments that a breach of the requirement to give or display the most recent gas safety certificate to new tenant before their occupation cannot be rectified. Arguments similar to that from Kaur v Griffith that even if the gas safety certificate was provided, a valid section 21 notice may not be given if the most recent associated gas safety check was conducted too long after the previous check was also rejected. The facts of the case and wording of the judgments however leaves open the possibility that a lack of a valid gas safety certificate at the time when the tenant first went into occupation under the tenancy remains an irremediable breach. The solicitor instructed by the tenant in Trecarrel House Limited v Rouncefield confirmed on Twitter that the tenant is seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Prescribed information  A landlord, other than a private registered provider of social housing, is required to give to the tenant the \\"How to rent: the checklist for renting in England\\" guide published by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The version given must be the version that has effect for the time being. The guide must be given in hard copy unless the tenant has agreed that the landlord may give the tenant notices and other documents given under or in connection with the tenancy by email, in which case it can be sent as an email attachment. Where the tenancy is a replacement tenancy, it is not necessary for the landlord to give the guide again unless a new version has been published since the last time the landlord provided the guide under an earlier tenancy. There is no requirement for the landlord to provide further copies of the guide during a tenancy when new versions are published. There is no case law as to whether the version provided must be the version current at the time the tenancy started, or at the time it is given. On 26 June 2018, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government published a new version of the guide with the title \\"How to... Rent A guide for current and prospective tenants in the private rented sector in England\\". With its different subtitle to that prescribed under the 2015 regulations, it is unclear if this version has any legal effect.

It came into force for new tenancies on 1 June 2019, and existing tenancies a year later. If the landlord have required and accepted a prohibited payment from a relevant person, or fail to handle a holding deposit in accordance with the legislation, then no section 21 notice may be given by the landlord until the prohibited payment or holding deposit have been repaid to the person who made the payment. Alternatively, the landlord must first obtain the consent of the relevant person to apply any prohibited payment or holding deposit which have not been repaid towards the payment of rent or tenancy deposit.

The Rhinelander is a medium-sized breed of domestic rabbit that originated in Germany. Rhinelanders are known for their distinctive facial \\"butterfly markings\\", a spine marking, colored ears, cheek spots, eye circles and side markings (on a white background) of black with orange or of blue with fawn. The Rhinelander breed is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC) and by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). Initially developed in Germany in the first decade of the 20th century, Rhinelanders began to be exported to other countries in the 1920s. Although popular in Germany at first, interest in the breed dwindled by 1930, possibly due to an increase in popularity of the Checkered Giant or to the lingering effects of World War I; however, they experienced a resurgence in popularity after World War II. Interest also waxed and waned in the United States, where the breed experienced a 40-year absence between 1932 and 1972. Re- establishment in the US in the 1970s resulted in the creation of the Rhinelander Rabbit Club of America in 1974. Today, the Rhinelander breed is considered rare in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Description The Rhinelander is an arched breed of rabbit, meaning that light shows between its body and the ground when the rabbit is sitting or moving. It is similar in appearance to the Checkered Giant breed, but smaller. The Rhinelander has a trim athletic appearance, with the body being the same width from shoulders to hip. The Rhinelander is known for its distinctive coat pattern and for its \\"butterfly markings\\" which cover the nose and upper jaw in a shape resembling a butterfly. British standard calls for a weight of , while the American registry prefers a weight of . The only color pattern recognized by the BRC is a white base colour with black and yellow markings on the face and back; however, ARBA recognizes a blue and fawn spotting pattern on a white background, in addition to the black and orange pattern. The mottled pattern of black and orange, called Japanese brindling, is caused by the eJ allele of extension. History This is a picture of a Rhinelander's head markings, taken by Christa Deines. The Rhinelander first appeared in shows in 1902 in Germany, after initially being bred in North Rhine-Westphalia. They were developed from a cross between a Harlequin buck and a gray papillon type doe. A buck from the litter had the markings that the Rhinelander would come to be known for - black and orange in color, located on the chin, ears and \\"butterfly markings\\" in black on one side and orange on the other. Another cross was made between the Harlequin buck and a Checkered Giant doe, with the resulting litter producing a doe with the desired markings. The buck from the first litter and the doe from the second litter were mated, and does from the resulting litters were crossed with Harlequin bucks to create the Rhinelander breed. In 1905, a German breed standard was created, and they were given the German name \\"Rheinishe Schecke\\". In 1924, the first rabbits were exported to the Netherlands and England. Although initially very popular, the initial interest soon dwindled, along with breeder numbers. Selective breeding for color markings, as required by the breed standard, was beyond the skill of many breeders; this, combined with the athletic, rather than meat-producing, conformation, resulted by 1930 in only a few breeders continuing to preserve the breed. Interest reemerged in post-World War II Germany, however, and population numbers again grew, with the Rhinelander becoming the most popular spotted breed in the country by 1978. After the first exports from Germany to the US in 1923, the Rhinelander was recognized as a breed in the US by the National Breeders and Fanciers Association. By 1932, however, none remained in the US, likely due either to the difficulties of meeting the breed standard or to greater breeder interest in the Checkered Giant rabbit. In 1972, an American breeder visiting West Germany saw the breed at a show and returned to the US with four Rhinelanders. In 1974, the Rhinelander Rabbit Club of America was created, and in 1975, the breed was acknowledged by the American Rabbit Breeders Association. Over the next two decades, additional animals were imported from the Netherlands and Germany to combat problems with inbreeding among the limited population in the US. Some breeders crossed Rhinelanders with Harlequin or Checkered Giant rabbits to improve the stock. In 1994, the American breed standard was rewritten and clarified, and interest in the breed continued to grow. The Livestock Conservancy currently places the breed at \\"watch\\" status, meaning there is a global population of less than 2,000 and fewer than 200 registrations in the US each year. In Britain, the Rhinelander breed is currently designated as a member of the BRC's \\"Rare Varieties Club\\".

The site is framed by the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Bay of Todos Santos on the other. The course is designed by Tiger Woods. When asked about the vision by CNN the founder, Brian Tucker, stated \\"to shape golf history by creating the most spectacular golf course on earth.\\" History In 2006, former Charles Schwab executive, Brian Tucker, set out to develop a world-class golf course after discovering a plot of land at the tip of the Punta Banda peninsula, which extends 7 miles into the Pacific Ocean. Because of the unique topography and coastline, the land became one of the most sought after golf design projects in the industry. Tiger Woods was privately awarded the contract to design the golf course in early 2008. On June 15, 2008 on the 18th hole of the final round of the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, Tiger Woods made a 12 foot birdie putt to tie Rocco Mediate and force a playoff round the following day. The public first caught wind of Punta Brava at the ensuing press conference that evening after Woods was asked what he had originally planned to do the following day. Briefly mentioning his site visit to Punta Brava, although he was closely guarded about it, set the media abuzz. Woods rescheduled his site visit to Punta Brava the following week where he walked the site on foot again, despite having a knee injury. Tucker noted, \\"Tiger's a perfectionist. He just keeps working the routing over and over again.\\" Tiger Woods at the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, shortly before he first mentioned the Punta Brava development project to the public The project was officially announced at a press conference at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles in October 2008 with capital support from billionaire Red McCombs In the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs coverage of the news conference, golf writer John Paul Newport opined after the conference, \\"Judging by the layout, it's possible that the course will break into the world's top 20 rankings on the day it opens. It looks to be a new and improved version of Cypress Point on California's Monterey Peninsula.\\" Design Map of the peninsula, showing the approximate location of the golf course under construction The Tiger Woods Design features seventeen tees or greens on the ocean and 5 holes with over ocean carries. Additionally, the 16th, 17th, and 18th holes run along the Pacific creating a dramatic finish. In the design Woods had paid meticulous attention to detail, making 27 routing maps, when most top architects only draw three or four. Woods said at a press conference in October 2008, \\"Every single hole on this golf course, whether on a tee, a fairway or a green, you can see the ocean. That makes Punta Brava very different from most golf courses, with the goal to make sure you are a part of this amazing peninsula every time you play.\\" Woods also said in regards to the course at the conference, \\"You have to walk it, to feel it, to realize how special it is, how beautiful it is, and what you can do with it. As soon as I got on site, I was in.\\" When describing the vision of the course design to Forbes, Tucker remarked \\"When you have a site surrounded on three sides by ocean and a golf architect (Tiger Woods) that completely integrates it by designing 17 tees or greens on/adjacent to the ocean‚Ä¶ you have the opportunity to create something special‚Äìa true golf club.\\" Punta Brava Golf Course will be a 6,835-yard par-70 course. The club will also have lodging for members. The New York Times reported that there were \\"grand plans of large villas and a clubhouse.\\" Ricardo Legorreta, winner of the prestigious UIA Gold Medal in 1999 and the Praemium Imperiale in 2011, was reported to be among the team of architects involved in Punta Brava. Tucker contracted Don Vita of Vita Associates who‚Äôs team has master planned the club as well as the landscape architecture.

The rings were sited next to estuaries that supported large populations of shellfish, usually oysters. Shell rings have been reported in several countries, including Colombia, Peru, Japan, and the southeastern United States. Archaeologists continue to debate the origins and use of shell rings. Across what is now the southeastern United States, starting around 4000 BCE, people exploited wetland resources, creating large shell middens. Middens developed along rivers, but there is limited evidence of Archaic peoples along coastlines prior to 3000 BCE. Archaic sites on the coast may have been inundated by rising sea levels (one site in 15 to 20 feet of water off St. Lucie County, Florida has been dated to 2800 BCE). Starting around 3000 BCE evidence of large-scale exploitation of oysters appears. During the period 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE shell rings, large shell middens more or less surrounding open centers, developed along the coast of the Southeastern United States. These shell rings are numerous in South Carolina and Georgia, but are also found scattered around the Florida peninsula. Some sites also have sand or sand-and-shell mounds associated with shell rings. Sites such as Horr's Island, in southwest Florida, supported sizable mound-building communities year-round. Four shell and/or sand mounds on Horr's Island have been dated to between 4870 and 4270 Before Present (BP).Milanich:84-85, 90, 95Russo 2006:10, 27 Groups living along the coast had become mostly sedentary by the Late Archaic period, living in permanent villages while making occasional foraging trips. Archaeologists have debated whether the shell rings resulted from the simple accumulation of middens in conjunction with circular villages, or if they were deliberately built as monuments. The start of mound building in the lower Mississippi River valley and in Florida by about 6000 years ago is cited as increasing the plausibility that the shell-rings were also monumental architecture. Excavations of the Fig Island rings revealed little evidence of habitation on the rings, and circumstantial evidence of rapid deposition of large quantities of shells in deliberate creation of the rings.Saunders:24, 85, 91, 101 Archaeological sites Sites in Colombia, Peru, and Japan, as well as in the southeastern United States, have been identified as shell rings. Residents of and visitors to the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia had long noticed circular shell mounds on some of the islands. The first written accounts of shell rings in South Carolina and Georgia appeared early in the 19th century. Archaeologists surveyed some shell rings near the end of the 19th century, but the first reported scientific excavation of a shell ring in the United States did not occur until 1933. Scientific excavation of shell mounds in Japan began in the 1920s. -Lawrence and Wrightson:1 - About 60 shell rings had been identified in the southeastern United States by 2002. Most date from the Late Archaic period (c. 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE), but shell rings were also constructed during the Woodland (c. 1000 BCE to 1000 CE) and Mississippian (c. 800 - 1500) periods. Close to 100 circular and horseshoe-shaped shell mounds have been identified in the Kant≈ç region of Japan (where a large majority of Japanese shell mounds are found). Shell rings in Japan have been dated from late in the Early J≈çmon period until early in the Late J≈çmon period (from before 3000 BCE until after 1000 BCE). While there are reports of a number of shell ring sites in Colombia, only the Puerto Hormiga shell ring (c. 3000 BCE to 2500 BCE) has been described in the archaeological literature.Some North American archaeologists have doubts about the ringed nature of the Puerto Hormiga ring.(Lawrence and Wrightson:3) Archaeologists have continued to identify and investigate additional shell ring sites into the 21st century.Russo, Heide and Holland:32 - -Habu:73, 191, 193 -Oikawa and Koyama:190 -Hemmings:7-8 -Schwadron:3 Shell rings in the United States may form a complete ring, or be open, C-shaped, or U- or horseshoe-shaped. They may form a nearly perfect circle, or an oval. In almost all cases, the central area or \\"plaza\\" contains little or no shell or occupational debris. Most shell rings in the United States consist primarily of oyster shells, but may include periwinkles, razor clams, whelks, ribbed mussels, hard-shelled clams (quahogs), and blue and stone crab claws and shell bits. The Common orient clam is the most common component in shell mounds in Japan. Other shells found in Japanese mounds include those of sea snails, surf clams (Mactra veneriformes), and Japanese littleneck clams (Tapes japonica).Russo:17 -Habu:73, 191, 193, 255 -Lawrence and Wrightson:4-5 Some shell ring sites have multiple rings. Some more-or-less equal-sized rings may be joined together in a \\"figure-8\\", as with the Skull Creek 1 and 2 and Coosaw 1 and 2 rings in South Carolina, or be touching, as with the two circular mounds in the Kasori shellmound in Japan. Smaller rings may be attached to a main ring, as at Fig Island 1 in South Carolina and the Rollins shell ring in Florida. Shell rings in southwest Florida are often associated with large mounds and other shell works. Shell rings in Georgia average in diameter, and those in South Carolina in diameter. The U-shaped shell rings in Florida described as of 2006 averaged in length. Middle and Late Jomon shell middens in Japan are often circular or horseshoe-shaped, typically about in diameter and may be up to in diameter.Russo:17, 24 - -Habu:73, 191, 193, 255 The known shell rings are various states of preservation. Rings have been impacted by rising sea levels, erosion, plowing, and coastal development. Shell rings, along with other shell mounds, have been mined for shell to be used in road paving and other construction projects. Shell rings in Peru have been particularly impacted by mining.Russo 2006:17 Lawrence and Wrightson:1-2 Construction and use Sewee Shell Ring, detail of southeast side, showing shells of which ring is made. Archaeologists debate whether shell rings developed incidentally from shells discarded around circular villages, or were intentionally built, perhaps for ceremonial purposes. Over the years archaeologists and others have proposed many uses for shell rings, including recreational (\\"gaming arenas\\"), ceremonial, \\"houses of state\\", astronomical observatories, religious, torture chambers, and fish traps. Many archaeologists believe that shell rings developed incidentally from shells discarded around circular villages of egalitarian hunter- gatherers. Supporting the assessment that the shell ring builders were egalitarian is the absence of prestige artifacts or burials associated with the rings.Lawrence and Wrightson:4 -Russo 2006:17 -Thompson and Worth:67-68 - Earthen mounds, including circular and horseshoe-shaped mounds, are found in Japan away from the estuaries that supported shell mounds. Evidence of pit houses in and adjacent to circular and horseshoe-shaped earthen mounds has been cited as evidence that the mounds resulted from normal settlements rather than construction for ceremonial purposes. Repeated construction of pit houses would have left dirt piled up around a village. This explanation of the development of mounds as a result of digging pit houses has been extended to also explain circular and horeshoe-shaped shell mounds. Thompson and Worth:69, 71 Several ring-shaped, C-shaped or horseshoe-shaped earthen mounds have been identified at sites in inland peninsular Florida, such as the River Styx archaeological site. Woodland period rings in the United States incorporated more soil into the rings, blurring the distinction between earthen and shell rings. The evidence of the shell rings for residential vs. ceremonial origins in the United States is mixed. Some shell rings, such as Sapelo 3, Lighthouse Point, and Stratton Place, had houses on the crest of the rings. Other rings, such as Horr's Island, Sewee, Sapelo 1, and Fig Island 1 had rings that were too steep for building on the crest. The top part of Fig Island 1 was built up with shells mined from other middens. Villages have been found near the rings at Horr's Island, Rollins, Guana, and Sapelo 1. No living site has been found at or near the Sewee, Joseph Reed, and Hill Cottage rings. The Horr's Island, Joseph Reed, and Fig Island sites supported large, settled populations.Russo 2006:17, 24 Russo points out that, while a circular shape implies an egalitarian society, asymmetry in a ring may represent occupation by a non-egalitarian society. Open rings are often highest and widest at the point opposite the opening. High status members of the community would have their houses on the highest point of a ring. There are also geographical variations. The Late Archaic shell rings in Florida are larger in area than those in Georgia and South Carolina, although the volume of shells in a ring is about the same in Florida and in South Carolina. The rings in Florida are also U-shaped, while the rings in Georgia and South Carolina are circular or C-shaped. The U-shaped rings in Florida have their open ends oriented to dry land, while the C-shaped rings in South Carolina are oriented to marshes. Russo interprets the difference to the sites in Florida having to accommodate larger and more complex (less egalitarian) communities than those that used the sites in Georgia and South Carolina. Sites in Florida may have accommodated an increased population (resident on the ring or attending ceremonies at the ring) by extending the arms of the ring, while sites in South Carolina may have accommodated larger populations by building new rings.Russo 2006:17, 23, 24 (Note: Clicking on Notes on South Carolina and Florida Shell Rings on this page downloads a .doc file.) Jadrnicek proposed an odorous order theory regarding shell ring formation November 2019. The theory suggests ring formations are caused by the odor of the shell wastes. As waste accumulated it would eventually rot and smell. Feasting rotated to avoid odors of rotting waste. Rotation of feasts occurred around a central access point usually a tidal stream leading to a circular form to the wastes deposited. Geophysical surveys showing intermittent deposition and pit formation under and in the interior of shell rings supports the theory Thompson, Victor D. ‚ÄúARTICULATING ACTIVITY AREAS AND FORMATION PROCESSES AT THE SAPELO ISLAND SHELL RING COMPLEX.‚Äù Southeastern Archaeology, vol. 26, no. 1, 2007, pp. 91‚Äì107. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40713419. Accessed 12 Oct. 2020. Although the large size of shell middens gives the impression that the people associated with them lived primarily on shellfish, careful excavation of middens has revealed large quantities of fish bones, indicating that the people obtained more of their protein and calories from small fish than from shellfish. There is no evidence that the shell-ring dwellers practiced horticulture, but gathered plants were exploited. Nuts, fruits and seeds have been excavated from shell-ring sites.Saunders:26 Notes Citations References    *   Further reading *Michael Russo, \\"Measuring Shell Rings for Social Inequality,\\" in Signs of Power: The Rise of Cultural Complexity in the Southeast, ed.

The Park Estate was formerly a private hunting park for the Duke of Newcastle who was also the owner of the adjacent Nottingham Castle. The Fifth Duke of Newcastle retained architect Thomas Chambers (T.C.) Hine (1813‚Äì1899) to design and build the Park Tunnel (primarily as the main entrance to the Park) and to develop the Park as a residential area in central Nottingham for the wealthier members of society. T.C.Hine was also made responsible for the later repair of Nottingham Castle and its conversion into a museum. The tunnel is approximately in length, with a central open section some in length. It was intended to allow access to and from the park by horse-drawn carriages, and the original requirement was for a tunnel with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14 and the ability for coaches to pass each other within the tunnel. As built, the tunnel actually had a gradient of 1 in 12, which was considered too great for horse-drawn carriages, and as easier accesses were constructed elsewhere in The Park Estate, it never fulfilled its original purpose. However the tunnel is still in use, providing pedestrian access to and from The Park Estate. From The Park Estate end, the tunnel is approached from Tunnel Road, and the original vehicular nature of the tunnel is clear from the ramped access. The first section of tunnel passes under Newcastle Drive and the Ropewalk and is unlined, being carved from the natural Nottingham Castle Sandstone. An open section in the centre of the tunnel provides natural light and ventilation, and a staircase ascends around the wall of this opening to the junction of the Ropewalk with Upper College Street. A second tunnel section passes under College Street whilst rising to meet Derby Road, but has been modified and partially blocked by subsequent building works, and access to Derby Road is now via a flight of stairs into the car park of the building above.

The route was operated by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD) and ran between Skjersholmane on Stord to Valev√•g on the mainland as part of European Route E39.Hauge (2001): 129 In 2000 the ferry transported 480,103 vehicles and 1,069,446 passengers.Hauge (2001): 131 Ferry traffic between Stord and the mainland was started with the ferry Hildur, originally on the route from Leirvik via Valev√•g to Mosterhamn in B√∏mlo. The route was started by Nils Hollekim in 1940, but was taken over by HSD and the ferry Tysnes in 1947. Responsibility for the route was taken over by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in the 1970s, which included the construction of new quays. This route continued to run to the port in Leirvik, but in 1983 it was moved to Skjersholmane where a twin-berth quay was built. As it was part of the main E39 road, it had a 30-minute headway during most of the day. The last two ferries to operate the route were MF Bj√∏rnefjord and MF Hordaland, the largest which could take 140 cars on two decks and 500 passengers. The route was terminated from 27 December 2000, when the B√∏mlafjord Tunnel, part of the Triangle Link, opened. In 2007, the ferry was temporarily reinstated as a free ferry service due to maintenance works in the B√∏mlafjord Tunnel.

The church is a grade II listed building. History A churchD Collinson and M Stevens, St Thomas of Canterbury, Kingswear Historians has stood on the present site since about 1170 on land owned by the de Vasci family since the Norman Conquest. Hugh Watkins in his article The foundation and early history of Dartmouth and Kingswear Church[H Watkins, Transactions of the Devonshire Association,43, pp 149-165, 1911] stated that the earliest deeds relating to the church were drawn up about 1173 and are in Totnes Priory: Willelmus de Vasci and his wife Juliana for the souls of their fathers and mothers and for the soul of Willelmus Buzun, give half the land of Kingeswere to Ricardus the deacon and to others succeeding him or serving the true God, Jesus Christ, and Saint Thomas there. By the license of lord Rogerus de Nunant whose fief the aforesaid land is and by the sanction of Wido de Nunant Renricus and Baldewinus. Ratified by the seal of lord Rogerus de Nunant and witnessed by Ricardus the chaplain, Johel de Waytord, Jordan de Hode, Robertus the serving man of Wido and the brothers of Martin. An abstract of another accompanying deed states: I, Willelmus de Vasci, for the safety of my soul and of my ancestors and of the soul of Willelmus Buzun my lord, have conceded and confirmed to God and to the Church of the Blessed Mary of Totonia and to the monks serving God there, half of the whole of my land which I have in Kingeswere, just as it can be reasonably divided by just men of our mutual friends, that is to say for the increase of the maintenance of the chaplain who for the time being serves the chapel founded in honour of the Blessed Thomas the Martyr at the said Kingeswere. Confirmed by the impression of my seal and witnessed by Michael de Spichewiche, Garinus de Morcell, Willelmus de Linguire, Osmundus de Colatun, Willelmus Daggevile, Willelmus de Winestone, Robertus le Bastard, Godefridus de Austine and many others. The church was dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury and this is thought to have originated because of the wave of piety which followed Thomas‚Äô death in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. Thomas Becket was canonized in 1173 so the naming of the church must date from after 1173. In its early days the church came under the sphere of influence of Totnes Priory and the church's priests were monks from the priory. In 1196 Willelmus Willelnusrywera formed Torre Abbey and Walterus de Vasci, son of Willelmus, gave the remaining part of the lands at Kingswear to the Abbey and Totnes Priory's holding was also transferred. A deed in the Cartulary dated 1253 shows that Torre Abbey then owned eight manors and churches: Aveton-cum-Townstal, Ffloade (in or near Ashton), Hopyrigge, Ducconbe, Wadeton, Achelglit, Kingswear and Blakawton. Records of the church's early history are few. On 6 April 1267 Bishop Walterus de Bronescombe held a convocation in the chapel of Saint Thomas the Martyr at Kynggeswere, at which the first person recorded as being present is the Abbot of Torre, but not the Prior of Totnes. The object of the convocation, according to the Register, had no local significance, but was to receive a petition of five parishioners from Okehampton that an interdict might be removed from their parish church. In 1280 Brother Philip, believed to be Philip Fitzurse, a descendant of Reginald Fitzurse one of the knights who murdered St Thomas, is a witness to a deed with several local landowners which include Willelmus de Fissacre. In the church there survives an ancient stone coffin lid, presumed to be part of his tomb. It is fortunate that Jeremiah MillesJeremiah Milles DD, FRS, Dean of Exeter 1762-1784 sent out questionnaires to parishes in Devon in preparation for a book which was never published. His notes are discussed by Ian Stoyle in \\"Devon Historian\\" 46 pp3-8 1933 in his Parochial Collections of 1755 visited the church, made a drawing and recorded the inscription and lettering of the words on the stone, while it was still possible to read the inscription round the edge of the stone, now scarcely visible. You who pray here for the soul of Philip shall have thirty days pardon as a reward. During the rebuilding of the Church 1845 to 1847 the stone was turned out into the churchyard where it lay among the weeds and the rubbish at the east end of the building and become more weathered and injured every year. By 1939 concern was expressed at its position and condition, but it was not until the Rev F H Keyworth (vicar 1935-55) that the ancient tombstone was brought back into the church where it lies on the left of the Lady Chapel. When Henry VIII fell out with Rome, the 1534 Act of Supremacy was passed which gave him the authority to disband the monasteries and confiscate their property. This included the land in Kingswear owned by the Torre Monastery. The following is a r√©sum√© of a parchment belonging to the Feoffees of Crediton, dated 22 February 1544:[Devon Notes and Queries, p249. 1919] Grant by Henry VIIIth under the Great Seal of England to Thomas Gale, for service and the sum of ¬£93 and 20 pence paid to ‚Äúthe Treasury of our Court of the Augmentation of Revenues.‚Äù all that our manor of Kyngeswere in the county of Devon formerly held by the monastery of Torre now dissolved as fully as the last Abbot of Torre held to the full value of ¬£5 3s. 5¬Ωd. with the tithe not deducted to hold for the service of X/60th part of a Knight‚Äôs fee while paying annually 10s. 4¬Ωd. to the Court of Augmentation of Revenues on the festival of St. Michael in the name of ferry tithe (decime pontis) for all services further we grant for the above consideration to the said Thomas Gale all rights of Court, assize of bread wine and beer tolls from fairs liberty of warren which the aforesaid Abbot had, and we acquit and exonerate etc, etc: and we wish that this be granted under the Great Seal of England. Witnessed on the 22nd February 35 Henry VIII. Vivian Thomas Gale lived in Dartmouth and died in 1557. His nephew, George, inherited his uncle's property, but lived in Crediton which may explain why the parchment was found in that town. Torre Abbey was dissolved in 1539 and Kingswear Church placed under the care of the Parish of Brixham. From the time of Brother Philip, very little is known of the history of the Church although there are record books and registers going back to 1601. It certainly continued to be a chapel of ease for the parish of Brixham under whose care it came at the Reformation and the Vicar of that Parish was responsible for providing the priest to serve Kingswear. The plague virtually decimated the village in 1604 when 145 people died from the disease, as marked in the parish register with the letter P. An account in Jeremiah Milles‚Äô Parochial Collections states: The church seems to be an ancient building, but is in a very indifferent and ruinous condition. It contains a nave and a south aisle and a gallery at the west end. Also a Pope‚Äôs Bowl, with the beads fastened to it dated 1309 and now in the parish chest. Services were held only once a month. It is believed by some that throughout the following centuries the church was much utilised by continental pilgrims who used Kingswear as a landing place on the pilgrimage to Canterbury to see the tomb of St Thomas. However, there appears little evidence to support this. In 1847, with the village of Kingswear expanding, funds were granted to rebuild the church with the work being overseen by Exeter architect J. Hayward. The church was demolished except for the original 12th-century tower with the rest of the church reconstructed in local limestone with freestone dressing. Hayward used the same Decorated style and the same design as the old church, but on a slightly reduced scale. Dartmouth.org. Gives some history. The interior Church features The church has a peel of three bells within the tower, there was formerly four but one was sold off in 1767 to pay for a clock for the church, it is not known which foundry cast the bells although one of them has a date of 1680 stamped on it. The present day clock dates from 1897, it cost ¬£124 and was purchased by subscription from Kingswear village to mark the sixtieth anniversary of Queen Victoria‚Äôs accession to the throne. It is thought by some that the octagonal font is Norman although Cresswell states that it is 15th-century,\\"Notes On Devon Churches\\", B.F. Cresswell, says font is 15th-century. the cover is mid-20th-century and is the work of a local craftsman. The carved wooden pulpit dates from 1921 and was a gift from the late Bishop William Boyd Carpenter while the oak choir stalls and seating come from the same year and were donated by Sir Thomas Leonard.\\"Kingswear Parish Church\\", Mike Trevorrow, (leaflet October 2009), Gives historical and architectural details. The organ dates from 1916, it was restored in 1950 at a cost of ¬£500, it now stands in a chamber on the north side of the chancel. The most noteworthy stained glass window is located near the organ, it depicts St Michael and is a memorial to Commander Valentine Gibbs who took part in the Zeebrugge Raid during World War I and is buried in the church cemetery. The church also contains a memorial and citation to Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jones VC who was killed in the Falklands War. The nave has some 18th-century tomb slabs on the floor while the porch contains a framed drawing of the church from 1841 and shows the building before the 1847 rebuild. British Listed Buildings. Gives details of architecture and some history. The Tower Although the church was rebuilt in 1847 the old tower was retained and dates from about 1173. In those days it was not normal for there to be settlements on the water's edge for fear of raids by Vikings, French and the Irish. Kingswear is not listed in the Domesday Book but that of Coleton to the east is. Similarly Dartmouth, on the opposite side of the river Dart to Kingswear is not listed either but Townstal to the west is. Both on the tops of hills relatively safe from unexpected raids. According to Charles CoxJ Charles Cox, English Church Fittings, Furniture and Accessories, Chap. III, B T Batsford (1923) church towers dating from the Norman period sometimes had an additional defensive purpose. This is especially true in the counties which suffered from border raids, such as Northumberland, but similar towers are found elsewhere. In these towers access was by a winding staircase around a central newel and protected by a portcullis. The towers had upper chambers with a fireplace with a flue to the roof to provide living accommodation. Much of this could easily apply to Kingswear's church tower although there is no evidence of a portcullis. The de Vasci family had extensive holdings in Northumberland dating from 1093 including the barony of Alnwick and so would have known about the dual use of church towers in that county. There is a history of raids from the sea in south Devon and these probably continued after the Conquest so there could have been a similar defence role to be met at the entrance to the river Dart. The Kingswear tower has a circular stone staircase to the first floor, taking two full turns to get to the higher level. Earlier accounts report a fireplace on the first floor with a flue to the roof. The flue still exists and stretches from the ground floor to the top of the tower.

Pope (Manchester University Press, 1939), pp. 183‚Äì208, at 196‚Äì97. was an Norman or Lombard nobleman who ruled an unknown region of southern Italy. He married Emma, a daughter of Robert Guiscard, and they had at least three sons, Tancred and William, both famous crusaders, and Robert, as well as a daughter (name unknown) who married Richard of Salerno. Odo is known only in connection to his wife and sons.F√©licien de Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole des chartes 4 (1842‚Äì43) 301‚Äì15. Name and nickname The only source to give Tancred's father the name Odo is Orderic Vitalis, who, like Ralph of Caen, believes him to be a brother-in-law and not son-in-law of Guiscard. In one passage he writes that, seeing his end coming, \\"the magnanimous Robert [Guiscard], duke, count, etc., called around him Odo the Good, the marquis, his sister's [husband], and other relatives and nobles\\". When Orderic later lists the crusaders of 1096, he mentions \\"Tancred, son of the marquis Odo the Good\\". Orderic's known erudition, and his contemporaneity with Tancred, make his testimony the best available on the latter's paternity.Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 312‚Äì313. Only on the parentage of Odo's wife, Emma, does Orderic seem mistaken. Since Tancred and his brother William were both young at the time of the First Crusade, it is unlikely that their mother could have been a daughter of Tancred's namesake, Tancred of Hauteville.Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 307‚Äì308. Evelyn Jamison identifies Tancred's father with the margrave Odobonus who witnessed a document issued by Count Roger I of Sicily at Palermo in 1094 and with the Odobonus Marchisus who appears in a lawsuit of 1097, now archived at Agrigento. A third reference, to Othonus, who commanded a division of Count Roger's at Taormina in 1078, may also be to Tancred's father. Paulin Paris suggested that Tancred's father's real name was the Arabic Ma·∏≥rƒ´zƒ´, corruped into Marchisus. He argued that Tancred's father was in fact a south Italian Arab and put forward as his evidence the Chanson d'Antioche (c. 1180), which calls Tancred fils a l'Asacant and fils a l'Amirant (son of the emir). This theory does not have wide support.Robert Lawrence Nicholson, Tancred: A Study of His Career and Work in Their Relation to the First Crusade and the Establishment of the Latin States in Syria and Palestine (University of Chicago Libraries, 1940), pp. 4‚Äì9. Jamison suggests that Tancred is so-called simply because he knew Arabic. Rank of marquis There are many sources that identify Tancred's father as a margrave (Latin marchio or marchisus, whence marquis), but do not name him. The rank of marquis was unknown in Normandy at the time and this suggests that Odo was Italian, possibly a Sicilian or Lombard, although the title was most common in northern Italy. Some north Italians are known to have settled in the south with the Normans. Many sources also identify a brother of Tancred's named William who was also a \\"marquis's son\\". According to William of Tyre, \\"Tancred [was] the son of William the Marquis\\", but the Latin word filium (son) is probably an error by later copyists where originally it read fratrem (brother). That Tancred possessed a brother named William is affirmed by the Gesta Dei per Francos, which records a \\"William, son of the marquis, brother of Tancred\\" among the followers of their uncle, Bohemond of Taranto, on the First Crusade. In that same document Tancred is referred to only as \\"the marquis's son\\". Robert the Monk, listing the crusaders who accompanied Bohemond, mentions \\"the most noble princes, namely Tancred, his [i.e., Bohemond's] nephew and the marquis's son. . .\\", confirming his father's rank but not his name. The archbishop Baldric of Dol records, with more proper Latin, that Tancred was Robert Guiscard's grandson and the son of a marquis. He also calls Tancred's brother William a marquis (marchisus). Guibert of Nogent, expressing some doubt that he has all his information correct, says that Tancred was the son of a certain marquis, accompanied his uncle Bohemond on the First Crusade, and that his brother William accompanied Hugh the Great. Marriage and sons There are other sources pertinent to the identity of Tancred's father, since they mention his relation to Bohemond through the latter's sister Emma. Albert of Aix, a contemporary, confirms that Tancred was a son of Bohemond's sister, but does not mention either his father or brother. He does, however, mention that Roger of Salerno was a \\"son of Tancred's sister\\", who must therefore have been the wife of Richard of Salerno.Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 304. Marino Sanuto the Elder records that Tancred was Bohemond's \\"nephew by his sister\\".Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 306. Two sources contradict the former, erroneously making Tancred a cousin and not a nephew of Bohemond, but do not name his father. The Gesta Francorum expugnantium Jerusalem of Fulcher of Chartres calls him \\"Bohemond's cousin\\" and Jacques de Vitry refers to \\"Bohemond with his cousin Tancred\\". Tancred's earliest biography, Ralph of Caen's Gesta Tancredi (Deeds of Tancred), praises him as \\"the most famous son of a famous lineage, [having] choice parents, the margrave and Emma\\". He was \\"the son indeed of a father not in the least ignoble\\", even though this father remains unnamed by Ralph and most other authors.Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 309‚Äì10. Throughout the Gesta Ralph calls Tancred Marchisides, using the Greek suffix -ides, meaning \\"son of\\", thus \\"son of the marquis\\". Elsewhere he lumps together Tancred and Bohemond as Wiscardides (\\"sons/descendants of Guiscard\\"), even though he mistakenly believed Emma to have been a sister and not a daughter of Robert Guiscard.Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 309‚Äì10.Emily Albu, The Normans in Their Histories: Propaganda, Myth and Subversion (Boydell, 2001), p. 166, n. 25. He also gives Tancred a brother named Robert, otherwise unknown: \\"the Guiscardids, Tancred and his brothers William and Robert\\".Saulcy, \\"Tancr√®de\\", 309‚Äì10.

His mission was given as \\"to combat German and Turkish propaganda and attempts to organise men, railways and resources towards assisting hostile enterprises, aggression or active operations against us or our Allies.\\"Moberly, F J, Operations in Persia 1914‚Äì1919, London: HMSO, 1987. p335 Malleson instructed Reginald Teague-Jones to make preliminary contact with the Ashkhabad Committee, the group in control of the anti-Bolshevik Transcaspian Government. The first military action occurred when a machine gun detachment was sent across the Indian border to aid the Transcaspian forces against the Bolsheviks. The detachment of Indian gunners, led by a British officer, assisted some local units in a battle against the Tashkent Soviet Bolsheviks. The local units were outnumbered, disorganised and nearly defeated. However, the two Indian machine gun crews inflicted 350 casualties and prevented a total rout of the Transcaspians. Malleson had further contact with the Ashkhabad Committee. They were eager to secure British funding and support, as they basically had no economy or method for raising funds. Two British colonels had secured dealings with another group, the Turkestan Union, a shadowy group who secured money from the British but whose motivation and levels of support were unclear. The group and the money were not seen again. On 12 August, Malleson moved his 500 men of the 19th Punjabi Regiment across the border. These joined the local force of 1,000 Transcaspians, who were seen by the British as rather poor quality troops. They were commanded by a Turkmen chieftain, Oraz Sirdar. The Bolshevik force, consisting of a good proportion of Austrian ex-POWs, attacked the British-Transcaspian force, but was repelled at Kushkh on the Afgan border.Sargent, p. 19 There was further action at Kaka, Turkmenistan, on 28 August, 11 September and 18 September, which saw a minor success for the British, encouraging the Transcaspian and British leadership in Meshed. Malleson then received some reinforcements with the arrival of the 28th Light Cavalry from Persia.Sargent, p. 19 At this point, Malleson, against the wishes of the Indian Government, decided to push further into Transcaspia and attack the Bolsheviks. The combined force completed a double night march, and engaged and defeated the Bolsheviks at Arman Sagad between 9 and 11 October and at the Battle of Dushak on 14 October.Ellis, C. H, \\"The British Intervention in Transcaspia 1918‚Äì1919\\", University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1963 p 75 At Dushak, the British force suffered 54+ killed & 150+ woundedEllis, p. 79 while inflicting 1,000 casualties on the Bolsheviks. The Anglo-Indian forces did most of the fighting, with the Transcaspian forces largely unreliable. A bayonet charge by the Punjabi infantry, as well as an attack by the 28th Cavalry, eventually drove off the Bolshevik forces. The Transcaspian forces retired to Kaakha, while the Bolshevik forces retired with their trains to Dushak but then pulled back further to Merv. The British occupied Tejend on 20 October. The Transcaspian force then went on to occupy Merv.Ellis, p. 76 Armoured trains featured in the battles, the British/Transcaspians having two, the Bolsheviks three. Roads were not usable and vehicles did not have the range. Armoured trains, armed with cannons, were used for transport and to attack. However, with the end of World War I, one of the primary reasons for the mission, the threat from the Germans and the Turks, was no longer extant. Malleson, however, felt compelled to support the Committee. Dick Ellis served as an officer with the Malleson mission, writing his account,The Transcaspian Episode, after he had retired.  Resignation of the committee  By late 1918 the Ashkhabad Committee was starting to lose grip on the capital and asked for British assistance. Malleson had not supplied the committee with the funds he had promised. There was general rebellion in the capital and the Ashkhabad Committee resigned. On 1 January 1919 a new Committee of Public Safety was formed to rule Transcaspia, its composition of five people largely chosen by Reginald Teague-Jones. He appointed two Turkmen to the new committee, and it became more susceptible to British influence at this stage. On 12 January, the British force came under attack from the Bolsheviks at Annenkovo, but defended the settlement with the loss of 12 killed and 38-39 wounded.Ellis, p. 132 White Russian forces, from General Anton Denikin's Southern White Russian Army, started joining the Transcaspian army in small groups. The Transcaspian Government soon became linked with the White Russian Forces.Sargent, p. 30 Denikin eventually started having more control over the force, as more of his troops starting fighting with them. On January 22, 1919 the White Turkestan Army was created.  British withdrawal  Malleson had spent some time planning how to extricate the British forces, which was a complex task. He had told the Committee confidentially that he was withdrawing; they had decided not to tell the public for fear it would cause panic. The Committee itself was alarmed at the news, though they had been making an effort to work with Denikin and the White Russians Ellis, p. 150 With Denikin's involvement in the Transcaspian, they now had a new sponsor. In order to safely withdraw, Malleson spread a rumour that the withdrawal was a feint for a flanking attack. The Bolsheviks were fooled by the ruse, and responded to the rumour by reinforcing their positions rather than pursuing the withdrawing British forces. The British forces, at this point numbering 950, began their withdrawal early in March. They had all left by mid April 1919. However, with the British gone, the Bolsheviks launched new offensives, gradually pushing the Transcaspian forces back. They were defeated by 1920, and the Bolshevik Tashkent Soviet regained control of the territory.

Facts  The respondents been evicted from their informal homes situated on private land earmarked for formal low-cost housing. They applied to a High Court for an order requiring the government to provide them with adequate basic shelter or housing until they obtained permanent accommodation. The High Court held * that, in terms of the Constitution,s 28(1)(c). the State was obliged to provide rudimentary shelter to children and their parents on demand if the parents were unable to shelter their children; * that this obligation existed independently of and in addition to the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures in terms of the Constitution;s 26. and * that the State was bound to provide this rudimentary shelter irrespective of the availability of resources. The appellants were accordingly ordered by the High Court to provide those among respondents who were children, as well as their parents, with shelter. The appellants appealed against this decision.  Arguments  The respondents based their claim on two constitutional provisions: # section 26 of the Constitution, which provides that everyone has the right of access to adequate housing, thereby imposing an obligation on the State to take reasonable legislative and other measures to ensure the progressive realisation of this right within its available resources; and # section 28(1)(c) of the Constitution, which provides that children have the right to shelter. It was contended that the minimum obligation incurred by the State in terms of section 26 entitled all the respondents, including those adult respondents without children, to shelter, and that the children's unqualified right to shelter included in section 28(1)(c) placed the right of children to that minimum obligation beyond doubt. In support of their contention that they had complied with the obligation imposed on them by the Constitution,s 26. the appellants placed evidence before the court of the legislative and other measures they had adopted concerning housing. The central thrust of the housing development policy evidenced by the legislation and other measures was to provide citizens and permanent residents with access to permanent residential structures with secure tenure, ensuring internal and external privacy, and to provide adequate protection against the elements. In addition, the relevant metropolitan council had formulated a land program specifically to assist the metropolitan local councils to manage the settlement of families in crisis. The program recognised: * the absence of provision for people living in crisis conditions; * the unacceptability of having families living in crisis conditions; * the consequent risk of land invasions; and * the gap between supply and demand of housing resulting in a delivery crisis. The primary objective of the program was the release of land for these families in crisis, with services to be upgraded progressively. At the time relevant to the matter, however, the program had not been effected. Counsel for the appellants submitted that section 26 did not require the provision of relief to families in crisis and that in fact, provision for people in desperate need would detract significantly from any integrated housing development.  Judgment  The Constitutional Court held that the issue of whether socio-economic rights are justiciable at all in South Africa is put beyond question by the text of the Constitution as construed in the judgment Ex parte Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly: In re Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.1996 (4) SA 744 (CC). The question of how socio-economic rights were to be enforced, however, was a difficult issue which had to be carefully explored on a case- by-case basis, considering the terms and context of the relevant constitutional provision and its application to the circumstances of the case.Para 20. The court found that interpreting a right in its context required the consideration of two types of context. On the one hand, rights had to be understood in their textual setting, which required a consideration of Chapter 2 and the Constitution as a whole. On the other hand, rights also had to be understood in their social and historical context. The right to access to adequate housing could not, therefore, be seen in isolation; it had to be interpreted in the light of its close relationship with the other socio- economic rights, all read together in the setting of the Constitution as a whole.Para 22.Para 24. The court held further that the state was obliged to take positive action to meet the needs of those living in extreme conditions of poverty, homelessness or intolerable housing. The interconnectedness of the rights and the Constitution as a whole had to be taken into account in interpreting the socio-economic rights and, in particular, in determining whether the state had met its obligations in terms of them.Para 24. The determination of a minimum obligation in the context of the right to have access to adequate housing presented difficult questions, because the needs were so diverse: Some needed land; others both land and houses; still others financial assistance. The real question in terms of the Constitution was whether the measures taken by the state to realise the right were reasonable.Para 33. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the court held, there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling. The right also suggested that it was not only the state which was responsible for the provision of houses, but that other agents within society had to be enabled by legislative and other measures to provide housing. The state therefore had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society.Para 35. Section 26 as a whole placed at the very least a negative obligation on the state and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing. The manner in which the eviction in the present circumstances had been carried out had resulted in a breach of this obligation.Para 34.Para 88. Section 26(2) made it clear that the obligation imposed on the state was not an absolute or unqualified one. The extent of the state's obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: # the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures # to achieve the progressive realisation of the right # within available resources.Para 38. Reasonable legislative and other measures (such as policies and programs) had to be determined in the light of the fact that the Constitution created different spheres of government and allocated powers and functions amongst these spheres, emphasising their obligation to cooperate with one another in carrying out their constitutional tasks. A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the state's obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the state's obligations.Para 39.Para 42. A court would have to enquire as to whether or not the measures adopted had been reasonable. It would be necessary, in doing this, to consider housing problems in their social, economic and historical context, and to consider the capacity of the institutions responsible for implementing a program. A reasonable program had to be balanced and flexible, and to make appropriate provision of attention to housing crises and to short- and medium- and long-term needs. A program excluding a significant segment of society would not be reasonable. Reasonableness also had to be understood in the context of the Bill of Rights as a whole, especially the constitutional requirement that everyone be treated with care and concern and the fundamental constitutional value of human dignity.Para 41.Paras 43-44.Par 83. The term \\"progressive realisation\\" showed that it was contemplated that the right contained in section 26 could not be realised immediately. The goal of the Constitution was, however, that the basic needs of all in the society be effectively met. The requirement of progressive realisation, furthermore, meant that the State had to take steps to achieve this goal. This meant that accessibility had to be progressively facilitated, involving the examination of legal, administrative, operational and financial hurdles which had to be lowered over time. Housing was required to be made accessible not only to a larger number of people, but also to a wider range of people over time.Para 45. In not requiring the state to do more than its available resources permitted in respect of its obligation to take the requisite measures, both the content of the obligation in relation to the rate at which it was achieved and the reasonableness of the measures employed to achieve the result were governed by the availability of resources. There was therefore a balance between goal and means. The measures had to be calculated to attain the goal expeditiously and effectively, but the availability of the resources was an important factor in the determination of what was reasonable.Para 46. The Housing ActAct 107 of 1997. made no express provision to facilitate access to temporary relief for people who had no access to land, no roof over their heads, living in intolerable conditions and in crisis because of natural disasters. These people were in desperate need. The Court accordingly had to decide whether the nationwide housing program was sufficiently flexible to respond to those in desperate need, like the respondents, and cater adequately for immediate and short-term requirements. This had to be done in the context of the scope of the housing problem in the relevant area which had to be addressed. The court also had to consider whether the absence of a component catering for those in desperate need was reasonable in the circumstances.Paras 52-53.Para 63. The absence of a component catering for those in desperate need may have been acceptable if the nationwide housing program would result in affordable houses for most people within a reasonably short time. This was, however, not the case; housing authorities were unable to state when housing would become available to those in desperate need. The immediate crises were accordingly not being met. The consequent pressure on existing settlements resulted in land invasions by those in desperate need, thereby frustrating the attainment of the medium- and long-term objectives of the nationwide housing program. For this reason, the land program had been adopted by the relevant metropolitan council.Para 65. The court held that the national government bore the overall responsibility for ensuring that the state complied with the obligations imposed on it by section 26. The land program adopted by the metropolitan council, on the face of it, met the obligation of the state towards persons in the position of the respondents to the extent that the national housing program did not. The existence of the program was, however, only the starting point. Effective implementation of it required at least adequate budgetary support by national government. As at the date of the launch of the application, the state had not been meeting the obligation imposed on it by section 26 within the relevant area. In particular, the programs adopted by the state fell short of the section's requirements, in that no provision was made for relief to categories of people in desperate need. The Constitution obliged the state to act positively to ameliorate these conditions. This obligation was to devise and implement a coherent and co-ordinated program, designed to provide access to housing, healthcare, sufficient food and water and social security to those unable to support themselves and their dependants. The State also had to foster conditions to enable citizens to gain access to land on an equitable basis. Those in need had a corresponding right to demand that this be done. However, section 26 (and also section 28) did not entitle the respondents to claim shelter or housing immediately on demand.Paras 66-69.Para 93. There was an evident overlap, the court found, between the rights created by sections 26 and 27 and those conferred on children by section 28. This overlap was not consistent with the notion that section 28(1)(c) created separate and independent rights for children and their parents.Para 74. Section 28 as a whole ensured that children were properly cared for by their parents or families, and that they received appropriate alternative care in the absence of family or parental care; it also encapsulated the conception of the scope of care that children were to receive in society. Through legislation and the common law, the obligation to provide shelter in subsection (1)(c) was imposed primarily on the parents or family and only alternatively on the State. The subsection therefore did not create any primary State obligation to provide shelter on demand to parents and their children if the children were being cared for by their parents or families. The State did, however, have to provide the legal and administrative infrastructure necessary to ensure that children were accorded the protection contemplated by section 28. Its obligation in this regard would normally be fulfilled by passing laws creating enforcement mechanisms for the maintenance of children, their protection from maltreatment, abuse, neglect or degradation and other forms of abuse, and in addition providing families with access to land, adequate housing and services.Paras 76-78. The court held, accordingly, that a declaratory order should be issued to substitute the High-Court order stipulating that section 26(2) of the Constitution required the state to act to meet the obligation imposed upon it to devise and implement a comprehensive and coordinated program to realise progressively the right of access to adequate housing. This included the obligation to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief to those in desperate need within its available resources.Para 96. The case at hand had brought home \\"the harsh reality that the Constitution's promise of dignity and equality for all remains for many a distant dream.\\"Para 2. People should, however, not be impelled by intolerable living conditions to resort to land invasions. Self-help of this kind could not be tolerated, for the unavailability of land suitable for housing development was a key factor in the fight against the country's housing shortage. The judgment of the court was not to be understood as approving any practice of land invasion for the purpose of coercing the State into providing housing on a preferential basis to those who participate in any exercise of this kind. Land invasion was inimical to the systematic provision of adequate housing on a planned basis.Para 2.Para 92.

It is known locally as The Peasy which is also the nickname of the Petershill club. History Before moving into the new modernised facility, Petershill had spent most of their existence (from 1935 until 2005) playing at the old Petershill Park. Up until its closure, the old park had one of the best playing surfaces in Junior Football. In 2005, it was demolished and replaced with a modern structure that could also be used by the local community. This was also to be known as Petershill Park. Facilities The stadium can also hold up to 2,000 spectators, with one stand (known as the main stand) containing 500 seats. This stand is attached to the club building, containing a bar, a function room, gymnasium, dance studio and health suite. Opposite the main stand is two steps of terracing, with a business centre located next to the right side of the main stand. To the left of the main stand, is more terracing. The centre also has a full-size football pitch, plus a number of 5-a-side pitches.  UEFA club matches  Over the two spells that Glasgow City have used the venue as a home ground, Petershill has played host to UEFA Women's Champions League football. Memorable matches have included a heavy defeat against German giants Turbine Potsdam in 2011 and a British clash with Arsenal in the last 16 in 2013. After a spell at the Excelsior Stadium, City returned to Petershill in mid-2017 and their Last 32 Champions League tie v BIIK Kazygurt was shown on the BBC Sport website on what was a dramatic encounter which Glasgow City won 4‚Äì1 but lost out on away goals after the aggregate scoreline finished 4‚Äì4. Accessibility The ground is only walking distance away from the railway stations, Barnhill and Springburn. By road, it is located next to the A803 leading onto the M8 a mile away.

Anduril is designed to enable systematic, flexible and efficient data analysis, particularly in the field of high-throughput experiments in biomedical research. The workflow system currently provides components for several types of analysis such as sequencing, gene expression, SNP, ChIP-on- chip, comparative genomic hybridization and exon microarray analysis as well as cytometry and cell imaging analysis. Architecture and features A workflow is a series of processing steps connected together so that the output of one step is used as the input of another. Processing steps implement data analysis tasks such as data importing, statistical tests and report generation. In Anduril, processing steps are implemented using components, which are reusable executable code that can be written in any programming language. Components are wired together into a workflow, or a component network, that is executed by the Anduril workflow engine. Workflow configuration is done using a simple yet powerful scripting language, AndurilScript. Workflow configuration and execution can be done from Eclipse, a popular multipurpose GUI, or from the command line. The core Anduril engine is written in Java and components are written in a variety of programming languages, including Java, R, MATLAB, Lua, Perl and Python. Components may also have dependencies on third-party libraries, such as Bioconductor. Components for cell imaging and microarray analysis are provided but additional components can be implemented by users. The Anduril core has been tested on Linux and Windows. Anduril 1.0: AndurilScript language Hello world in AndurilScript is simply std.echo(\\"Hello world!\\") Commenting follows the syntax of Java: // A simple comment /* Another simple comment */ /** A description that will be included in component description */ Components are called by assigning their calls to named component instances. Names cannot be re-used within a single workflow. There are special components for input files that include external files to the script. Supported atomic types are integer, float, boolean and string, and typing is done implicitly. in1 = INPUT(path=\\"myFile.csv\\") constant1 = 1 componentInstance1 = MyComponent(inputPort1 = in1, inputParam1 = constant1) Workflows are constructed by assigning outputs of component instances to inputs of following components. componentInstance2 = AnotherComponent(inputPort1 = componentInstance1.outputPort1) Component instances can also be wrapped as functions. function MyFunction(InType1 in1, ..., optional InTypeM inM, ParType1 param1, ..., ParTypeP paramP=defaultP) -> (OutType1 out1, ..., OutTypeN outN) { ... statements ... return record(out1=x1, ..., outN=xN) } In addition to standard if-else and switch-case statements, AndurilScript also includes for-loops. // Iterates over 1, 2, ..., 10 array = record() for i: std.range(1, 10) { array[i] = SomeComponent(k=i) } Extensibility Anduril can be extended on multiple levels. Users can add new components to existing component bundles. However, if the new component or components carry out tasks that are not related to existing bundles, users can also create new bundles. =Moksiskaan= The upset face of the Moksiskaan logo Moksiskaan is a data integration framework for the cancer research and molecular biology. The framework provides a relational database that represents a graph of biological entities such as genes, protein, drugs, pathways, diseases, biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. In addition, there is a wide set of analysis and accession tools built on top of this data. The great majority of these tools are implemented as Anduril components and functions. Moksiskaan is used mainly to interpret lists of candidate genes obtained from the genomic studies. Its tools can be used to generate graphs of biological entities related to the input genes. The exact for of these graphs may vary from the drug target predictions to the time series of signalling cascades. Some of the goals of these tools are closely related to IPA.
