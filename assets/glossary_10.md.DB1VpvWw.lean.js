He served as a representative in the Connecticut General Assembly from 1923 to 1931 and was a member of the UConn Board of Trustees from 1922 to 1942. Wood's obituary in the Hartford Courant described him as \\"one of the state's leaders in the dairy and agricultural circles.\\"  Biography  Wood was born on August 4, 1864, while his family was temporarily living in Montreal. His parents were Andrew S. and Lois P. (Childs) Wood. Wood went to school in Newbury and St. Johnsbury in Vermont. He completed his secondary education at Northampton High School and earned his bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1886. He earned his doctorate of medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1889, specializing in surgery. Wood interned at Bellevue Hospital. He subsequently served as a staff member at St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn for ten years, chief surgeon at Brooklyn Hospital for fifteen years, and professor of surgery at Long Island University for seven years. During these two decades of practicing medicine, Wood authored fifteen pamphlets on surgical subjects, published in various medical journals. In 1906, Wood purchased a property, which he called Brushwood Farms, in New Canaan, Connecticut. Suffering from exhaustion brought on by his intense schedule, Wood retired from medicine in 1911 and moved full-time to the New Canaan countryside, where he recovered his health. The retired surgeon quickly became a dairy farmer and advocate for Connecticut agriculture, campaigning for the safety and quality of millk. He was instrumental in organizing the Fairfield County Farm Bureau and the Connecticut Farm Bureau Federation, which he served as president and vice president. He also served as director of the Connecticut Milk Producers Association and president of the Eastern States Farmers' Exchange. In addition to his organizing and advocacy on behalf of Connecticut's farmers, Wood was active in local and state government. He served on the New Canaan town council, the town board of finance (1921‚Äì1942), and the Republican Party's town committee. Following his service on the town council, he was elected four consecutive two-year terms to represent New Canaan in the Connecticut General Assembly from 1923 to 1931. Wood served nearly twenty years on the board of trustees of the University of Connecticut, from 1922 to 1942. In 1932, the university awarded him a certificate for \\"outstanding contributions to rural welfare in the state.\\" As chair of the board, he clashed with President Charles C. McCracken, who resigned under pressure in 1935. Built in 1940 and located on Glenbrook Road in Storrs, UConn's Walter Childs Wood Hall was named in his honor. Originally serving as a men's residence hall, Wood Hall housed the history department and the office of institutional equity as of 2020. Wood married Ellen Rich Davis (1864‚Äì1939) in Brooklyn on December 8, 1892. The couple had one child, Eleanor Woods Thomsen (1896‚Äì1978). Wood died on November 23, 1953, at Brushwood Farms in New Canaan. He was 89 years old. He was interred at New Canaan's Lakeview Cemetery.

It was designed by Warren & Wetmore in the Neoclassical style and built in 1924‚Äì1925. The Madison Belmont Building has a \\"transitional\\" design that deviates from Warren & Wetmore's other commissions, combining elements of the Neoclassical style and more modern influences from the Art Deco style. 183 Madison Avenue's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The base, comprising the lowest three stories of the facade, contains iron-and-bronze showroom frames, grilles, and doors designed by Edgar Brandt. The shaft contains brick piers, between which are recessed bays that contain windows and spandrels. The upper stories contain architectural terracotta ornamentation and a large cornice. The lobby is finished in bronze and marble, and contains a vaulted ceiling. 183 Madison Avenue was constructed as a showroom building for a development company called the Merchants & Manufacturers Exchange of New York. It originally housed showrooms for silk companies in Manhattan's \\"Silk District\\". In 2011, the building's exterior and first floor interior were made New York City designated landmarks. Site 183 Madison Avenue is in Murray Hill, Manhattan, on the southeast corner of Madison Avenue and 34th Street. The building is shaped like an \\"L\\", running along Madison Avenue to the west and 34th Street to the north. A section extends southward toward 33rd Street, where it has a frontage measuring . Its official address is 181‚Äì183 Madison Avenue, though the building carries alternate addresses of 31 East 33rd Street and 44‚Äì46 East 34th Street. Nearby structures include the Grolier Club and 2 Park Avenue to the south, as well as the Collectors Club of New York and the B. Altman and Company Building to the north. Design 183 Madison Avenue was designed by Warren and Wetmore in the neoclassical style. The doors and metal ornamentation at the base, as well as the metal work in the lobby, were designed by Edgar Brandt, a French iron worker. The building is tall, and was built with 17 stories. An additional floor was erected on the roof for mechanical equipment and commercial space in 1953. 183 Madison Avenue contains with 30 commercial units. The design was distinguished from Warren and Wetmore's previous commissions, which had included the Grand Central Terminal and surrounding structures. 183 Madison Avenue's design also included more modern influences in the Art Deco style, which had just started to become popular when the building was completed. In addition to brick and architectural terracotta, more than of iron was used. Brandt's lower-floor design was one of the first usages of Art Deco in a building in the United States. In 1925, International Studio magazine characterized the main entrance doors as being \\"carried to the nth power of perfection\\". =Facade= Entrance on 34th Street The articulation of the facade consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. While the facade was made mostly of brick, it also used carved terracotta motifs designed by the New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company. The terracotta used on the Madison Belmont Building is flatter and simpler in design than on Warren and Wetmore's other structures. The base consists of three stories. On Madison Avenue and 34th Street, the base is clad almost entirely with large display windows set between granite piers, which are twice as wide as the bays above. The windows are set within gilded bronze frames, and below the first floor windows, there are geometrically patterned iron motifs. The eastern end of the 34th Street facade contains the building's main entrance; there is also a showroom entrance on Madison Avenue and a service entrance at 33rd Street. The entrance doors were inspired by the Art Deco style, and are topped by transoms with black-and-gold motifs resembling frozen fountains. On 33rd Street, the first-story opening is a steel service entrance while the second story contains a ventilation grate. The third and fourth stories on 33rd Street contain large windows with red frames, with metal spandrels underneath the windows, and a small cornice above the fourth story. The shaft, consisting of the fourth through fifteenth stories, includes continuous vertical piers made of brick. The piers subdivide the facade into narrow bays, which contain one recessed window on each floor. The windows are surrounded by red metal frames, and the window openings on each floor are separated by spandrels made of multicolored brick. On 34th Street and Madison Avenue, the fourth floor windows are flanked by terracotta panels and topped by terracotta pediments. On 33rd Street, the windows are not decorated or recessed, and there is a band course above the tenth floor. The 33rd Street side is set back above the eleventh floor. Above the fifteenth story is a large terracotta cornice and three additional stories set back from all sides. The sixteenth and seventeenth stories contain terracotta ornamentation, and their center sections are set back slightly less than the outer sections. The eighteenth story is set back further and is not decorated. =Lobby= The main lobby runs southward from the 34th Street entrance, leading to a vestibule that connects to a rectangular lobby. In turn, the lobby connects to the building's elevators and showrooms. Unlike other elevator lobbies in contemporary New York City buildings, the Madison Belmont Building's lobby does not contain any stores or auxiliary spaces; it only has a security desk, a bronze backlit tenant directory, and elevator doors. The lobby is highly ornamented with bronze and marble. Christopher Gray of The New York Times wrote that the lobby \\"puts other Midtown [Manhattan] lobbies to shame\\". The lobby is designed with motifs from ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture. These depictions include the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, as well as mythological figures such as Mercury, the Roman god of trade and travel. The walls are clad with multicolored marble set inside bronze frames, which in turn contain Egyptian motifs such as lotus leaves and sphinxes The top of the lobby wall is circled with a metal frieze that contains Greek-vase and arabesque motifs. At the southern end of the lobby are four bronze elevator doors. The floors are made of terrazzo tiles. Bronze-framed roundels, some of which contain motifs related to silk production and transport, separate the coved ceiling into several sections. Light panels with stencils of mythological beasts run along the edge of the ceiling, and light fixtures also hang from the center of the ceiling. Other objects in the lobby, such as a mailbox and fire alarm box, also contain bronze decorations. History Manhattan's Silk District, concentrated around the lower section of Park Avenue South in the 19th century, had moved northward to the intersection of Madison Avenue and 34th Street by the early 1920s. During that time, the upper-class residences that had characterized the adjacent portion of Madison Avenue in the 19th century were being replaced with retail establishments. Three of the plots that form 183 Madison Avenue's site had been held by August Belmont Jr. until 1915. The Madison Belmont Building, along with a 16-story structure on the southwestern corner of Madison Avenue and 34th Street, were to form the core of the relocated Silk District. = Construction = A historical plaque on the building The Madison Belmont Building was developed by Robert M. Catts, a real estate developer who served as the Merchants and Manufacturers Exchange of New York's president. Catts purchased several plots for the building in February 1924, including a plot on 33rd Street and the southeastern corner plots at Madison Avenue and 34th Street. Concurrently, Catts hired Warren & Wetmore to design a 17-story structure for tenants in the silk industry. William A. White and Sons arranged an $825,000 mortgage for the site in June 1924. In May 1924, silk manufacturers Cheney Brothers leased the lowest three stories and basement for 21 years. Cheney Brothers hired Brandt to design the decorative ironwork because Brandt was already affiliated with the company. The company's art director Henry Creange had become acquainted with Brandt through several exhibitions in the early 1920s, and Cheney remade several of Brandt's designs in silk. The Madison Belmont Building opened on October 15, 1925. The ceremony was overseen by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett, while commerce secretary Herbert Hoover, geologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, jeweler Louis Comfort Tiffany, and the French minister of commerce were among those who sent telegrams to celebrate the opening of the Cheney showroom in the building. The Cheney showroom occupied the corner space at 34th Street and Madison Avenue on the first through third floors. = Use = Catts had gone into bankruptcy by 1927. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company placed a new first mortgage of $2 million on the Madison Belmont Building in 1930. At the time, the building had a rent roll of $475,000 and was 95% rented. A second mortgage of $150,000 was placed on the building the next year. Cheney Brothers, meanwhile, experienced financial difficulties in the late 1920s and early 1930s because of changes in the economy and silk industry, and in 1935, the business was reorganized. When Cheney reorganized, a federal judge in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut ruled that Cheney's annual lease of $155,000 at the Madison Belmont Building was too high. During the mid-20th century, the upper floors were leased to tenants such as the publications Management Corporation, which published Esquire magazine, as well as the Blue Print Company, which had a photostat printing plant in the building. The Madison Belmont Corporation transferred the title for the Madison Belmont Building to the Madison-Thirty-Fourth Street Corporation in 1942 for $40,000. A mechanical floor was added to the building in 1953. 183 Madison Avenue was later owned by British businessman Paul Kemsley, who had lost control of the building by 2010. At the time, its tenants were mainly lingerie companies. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the facade and lobby interior as official New York City landmarks on September 20, 2011. The building was purchased in 2014 by a joint venture composed of Tishman Speyer and The Cogswell-Lee Development Group, at a cost of $185 million. At the time, 95% of space in the building was leased. The building was resold to APF Properties in 2018 for $222.5 million. Early-21st century tenants of 183 Madison Avenue have included a law firm, an audio company, an architectural firm, and an advertising firm, as well as the coworking company WeWork.

The progressive movement to online resources and the need for more accessible mental health services has given rise to the creation of online-based interventions aimed to help those who have experienced traumatic events. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of trauma-related disorders and adapting CBT to an online format has been shown to be as effective as in-person CBT in the treatment of trauma. Due to its positive outcomes, CBT-based internet treatment options for trauma survivors has been an expanding field in both research and real-life settings. thumb  Background  Telepsychiatry in the form of teleconferencing dates back to 1959, when it was used for research and consultation at the University of Nebraska. Then in 1968, successful emergency consultation services were provided via telehealth delivered in Boston and New Hampshire. With the development of larger systems of operation, such as universities and federal health systems, telemental health services began seeing an uptake in research and randomized control trials in the 1990‚Äôs. Progress continued at a steady pace until 2003, when there was a notable change in the amount of advancement made in this area. Despite early research and success in using telemental health in the treatment of disorders such as anxiety and behavioral problems, more recently, tailoring treatment for trauma survivors to an internet-based format has been gaining momentum. The growing interest in internet-based treatment options is a result of numerous factors. Convenience is one major reason for the creation and development of such formats. Internet-based treatment options allow for the user to choose when and where to access their program and can more easily fit treatment into their schedule, including after-hours treatment. Anonymity is another reason why users would want to turn to such programs, especially if they feel embarrassed about their reasons for seeking help. Cost-effectiveness, accessibility for those who live in more isolated or rural areas and for those of marginalized or minority populations are other reasons. Furthermore, limitations occur that hinder people from attending in-person therapy, including childcare, transportation, or getting time off of work. The development of internet-based treatment options allows individuals with these reasons or limitations to be able to access care without the need for in-person interaction.  Formats  Internet-based treatment options for trauma-related symptomology exist in the forms of healthcare-supported telehealth options, mobile applications (apps), online group and peer support, and online resources provided by organizations. = Healthcare-supported telehealth = Healthcare providers who have mental health services mostly have online psychotherapy options available, especially as a result of the shift to telehealth in the wake of COVID-19. These services can include both video and phone conferencing between professionals and clients. These providers treat a wide variety of mental disorders, including trauma and stress-related disorders. Options that are available through healthcare providers can include individual therapy through therapist- supported teleconferencing, virtual support groups, and other self-guided online resources. = Mobile apps = The advent of smartphone and tablet apps has allowed for an easily accessible platform that an individual can use flexibly within their own schedule. The Department of Veteran‚Äôs Affairs (VA)‚Äôs National Center for PTSD has developed fifteen mobile apps, including seven apps that are designed to be used with a clinician, and eight self-guided apps that can be used either with or without a clinician. One of these apps, PTSD Coach, is the most well-known mobile app for treating PTSD and has been shown to be an acceptable intervention for those displaying PTSD symptoms. A growing number of mobile apps exist to aid in trauma-care and the high-quality and evidence-based apps have been found to be beneficial. = Group support = Videoconferencing telehealth group-based treatment options for trauma survivors have also been shown to be effective. Group support options can come in different forms, including health professional-assisted group sessions and peer-to-peer support. Furthermore, countless trauma and PTSD support groups exist online and have been found to be effective in lessening stress, depression, and trauma-related symptoms. Mobile app group and peer support have also become available and hasve been shown to be effective, as well. = Additional online resources = Additional organization websites also provide psychoeducation and other resources for children, adolescents, and adults, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and other branches of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Alternatives to CBT-based treatments  Other treatment approaches can be found online, as well, including cognitive therapy for post- traumatic stress disorder (CT-PTSD). Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EDMR) has been integrated into twelve mobile apps, though only six have been found to be acceptable to use in conjunction with a professional. Though CBT has a mindfulness component, there are apps that are being specially developed to only focus on mindfulness as a means to aid in trauma-care, including one developed by the VA‚Äôs National Center for PTSD. Prevention programs are also in the early stages of development and are aimed at high risk populations.  Other Considerations  Though there are numerous advantages for the development and growth of internet-based interventions for trauma, there are also situations in which telehealth might not be beneficial. Children in abusive households could have trouble benefiting from telemental health options in that they may not have the ability to recognize dissociative symptoms, may not have a private space, may not be able to process their trauma when they are not in a safe space, and may not be able to pay attention due to emotion regulation problems. Similar patterns can also be seen in adult populations as well, such as during COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders that have impacted victims of domestic violence. Another consideration with internet-based treatment options is the dropout rate. Similar to the dropout rates for using internet-based treatment options for other mental disorders, online trauma-focused interventions appear to have a generally high dropout rate, with a range of between 15-41% dropout rates during clinical trials. The gamification, or use of gaming elements, of mental health apps is one approach to addressing this issue and has been gaining support for improving adherence to app programs, as well as increasing resiliency.

She specializes in sandcast glass work, a method inspired by bronze casting, and is a pioneer of the glass art equivalent. Early life and education Rose graduated from Tulane University, acquiring a Bachelor of Fine Arts with Honors in Glass. She then acquired a Master of Fine Arts at the California College of Arts and Crafts. She also studied at the Pilchuck Glass School founded by Dale Chihuly and Anne Gould Hauberg. As she was starting her glass artistry, Rose recalls seeing many functional pieces, such as kitchenware, made from glass and thinking, ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a statement. There wasn‚Äôt an expression, a communication, with this shape.‚Äù This helped further actualize her eventual predilection toward glass sculpture. Rose is among the first artists to use traditional bronze casting methods with glass, having used and developed such practices since the 1980s. Career In 2007, Rose was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant. In 2016, Rose opened the Marlene Rose Gallery in Clearwater, Florida, which is the first gallery created for the sole purpose of exhibiting her artwork. On September 29, 2019, Rose was featured on a segment of CBS News Sunday Morning titled \\"Glass Cast in Sand\\", where she was interviewed by Lee Cowan. Technique Rose's usual glass- making technique is inspired by bronze casting. Rose pours molten glass - which she refers to as \\"lava\\" - into a sand mold, then waits upwards of six days for her pieces to cool in the oven before removing the piece from the mold. Rose is strongly inspired by artistic traditions and past civilizations of African and Asian origin. Frequent motifs in her sculptures include Buddha heads and butterflies.

It is located approximately north of the town of Dunmanway in the townland of Togher, which derives from the Irish \\"tochar\\" meaning \\"causeway\\", or \\"causeway of wood over a bog\\".  Description  Purportedly built on the site of an older structure, Togher Castle sits on a low rocky ridge, about 100 metres north of the River Bandon. While the tower house has had slight modifications over time, the overall fabric remains true to the original design when it was first erected. Principally serving a defensive function, many of its features considered the comfort of the residents associated with the era of fortified houses. Today, there is no remains of a bawn, or any other form of enclosure. Rectangular in plan, the breath of the east and west walls measure approximately 10 metres (32 ¬Ω ft), and the length of the north and south walls approximately 16.4 metres (54 ft). The overall height is estimated to be about 18 metres (57 ft). The exterior walls were originally pointed smooth with mortar, with the windows being finely dressed with Cork limestone. The base- batter slopes from the ground level to the first floor. The parapet wall is now mostly ruined, except the western side which survives to its full height. Two great machicolations or bartizans project from the south-east, and north- west corners respectively, with the latter well-preserved. Togher is an unvaulted tower house, with no surviving ceiling over any of the four floors, except the remnants of 19th century corrugated iron sheets acting as a roof. The whole interior structure is divided into two unequal sections by an offset partition wall to the east side, running between the north and south main walls, and extending the full height of the tower. This allows for the division of the floors into two sets of chambers with the western sections being the larger. The central chimney stack, a continuation of the internal partition wall, contains live flues, while the chimneys on the east and west gables are a decorative feature. The original ground floor entrance is located to the east, with a window in the western wall since enlarged into an additional doorway. On the right wall of the entrance hall hangs a late 19th century MacCarthy coat of arms funded by Daniel MacCarthy (Glas) (1807‚Äì1884), with the lines: Mac Car·π´aiƒ° an orsa, la·πÅ laidir a bua·∏ã, which translates to \\"Mac Carthy of the forces, victory to the strong hand\\". alt= The large ground floor major chamber is suggested to have once served primarily as a store room or a wine cellar. On the north-eastern corner of the tower house, a circular winding staircase leads from the entrance hallway to the top level, from which doors open to each of the major chambers on each floor. A small windowless dungeon is located left of the first stairway, and is recorded by Lyons & Gillman as chambrin a chodaigh (\\"the tyrant's little chamber\\"). The first floor chamber may have been used as a low-status hall, functioning as both a wardroom, as well as acting as a kitchen; with the small chamber on the east side serving as a pantry. Two published surveys of the tower house differ in the role of the second and third floors. Lyons & Gilman (1895, 484) speculate the second floor was the location of the private apartments, due to the minor chamber being named chambrin na banaltran (\\"the little chamber of the nurse\\"). They then postulate that the State room was the third floor based on its structural layout, with smaller uniformed windows, and an offset positioned fireplace with the remains of a once decorated mantel piece projecting from the wall. However, Samuel (1998, 267) reasons otherwise, with the second floor being the principle chamber of the tower house, due to the location of the great fireplace, and once large decorated windows; as well as in keeping with the supposed role of second floor in other unvaulted tower houses. And thus, he states that the private quarters were situated on the third floor. Two rooms on the top floor level have been identified as a large attic and a minor storeroom, both of which were once overhung by the original roof.  History  Togher Castle was built by Tadhg-an-Fhorsa I, otherwise known as \\"Teig M'Dermod M'Cormoek M'Cartie, alias Teighe O'Norso [\\"of the Force\\"], of Downeboy [Dunmanway]\\". An-Fhorsa I was the chief of the MacCarthys of Gleannacroim, the Sliochd Feidhlimidh, who were cousins to the MacCarthy Reaghs of Carbery‚Äîitself a branch of the MacCarthy M√≥r dynasty. The tower house borders the north-western part of the Gleannacroim territories, which was estimated to be approximately 12,814 acres and in its heyday contained 57¬Ω townlands. Along with Togher, the clan's other strongholds included the now demolished Dunmanway Castle and perhaps an earlier structure once located at Ballinacarriga‚Äîthough the latter was afterwards a castle of the Hurleys. It is believed that the construction begun following Tadhg an Fhorsa's acquisition of the Sept lands by royal letters patent from Elizabeth I of England in July 1590, under the system of \\"surrender and regrant\\". The act consolidated Tadhg's hold on the clan after a chain of events in which his elder brother, Cormac Donn assassinated their first cousin and rival claimant, the \\"official\\" tanist, and thus chief of the clan Cormac Mac Finin. For this crime, Cormac Donn was tried and executed in 1576 and the clan territory came under control of the Crown. As all three individuals were grandchildren of a former chief of the clan, Tadhg's right of succession was acknowledged by the Sept in 1578. However, some 12 years later with the coming of age of Finin, the son of the murdered chieftain, Cormac Mac Finin the question of true inheritance and position emerged. Tadhg an Fhorsa I was thus motivated to travel to London in 1590 with Sir Walter Raleigh to surrender the said lands of Gleannacroim, despite their past forfeiture, to be re-granted to him in full as his personal estate under English tenure. On Tadhg's death in 1618, Togher Castle passed to his younger son Dermod, with Dunmanway Castle going to his elder son and successor, Tadhg-an-Duna I (\\"of the fortress\\"). As a result of the family's involvement in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 the estate was forfeited in 1651. The tower house and a surrounding estate of 1,419 acres (574 hectares) passed to Hoare brothers of Iretons army in 1667 from the original grantee Lord Kingston. In the late 19th century, the structure was re-roofed with financial assistance contributed by Daniel Mac Carthy (Glas). During this period, Fr Lyons devised a plan to utalise the building for local industry, but nothing came of this venture. The castle was also recorded as the location of a small school.

Ontopoetics is a philosophical concept that involves the communicative engagement of self with the world and the world with the self. It is also described as a \\"poetic order\\" that unfolds alongside the \\"causal order\\" in the process of the communicative engagement with reality and participating in it. It includes the perception of cues or signals, or the expression of actors, as well as \\"the construction of impressions on re-actors by the deliberate choice of attractive signifiers that communicate factual or illusory realities\\". Ontopoetics is not considered a theory but a view of reality and an understanding of the world as a communicative presence.  Concept  Ontopoetics is derived from the Greek words ontos (\\"that which is\\" - \\"I am\\" or \\"being\\") and poiesis (\\"coming into being\\" - creation\\" or \\"bringing forth\\"). It is also noted that the poetic element to the concept connotes a complexity that embraces diversity of experiences so that those that do not lie within the bounds of one's tradition are not rejected or denied. The concept also includes the manner by which humans respond to the symmetries around them. It is distinguished from panpsychism in the sense that it does not merely claim that the world is psychoactive but that it is responsive to us so that it can be called forth if engaged on an expressive plane, one of meaning and not merely of causation. As a concept, ontopoetics looks into the creative relationship between things and focuses on the poetic infrastructure of creation (e.g. order of an insect, structure of a seed, or the composition of a bird song). Aside from the cues, expressions, or signifiers made to communicate realities, ontopoetics also covers the \\"construction of imaginary situations by certain species\\" such as animal cheating, mimicking, and playing. Ontopoetics holds that the world is not only object-domain as represented by physics but is also \\"a field of meaning\\". According to the Australian philosopher Freya Mathews, this understanding of the world allows for unmasking of realities and experience that are not familiar or known to science. This is attributed to the manner by which the paradigm produces a more dynamic and responsive self and poetic voice as experience and knowledge are directed by receptiveness, playfulness, and openness across human-nature divisions. The idea is that conceptual intelligence cannot access a depth of reality because it tends to trivialize it. This is also the case for possibilities of experience that are routinely open but are taken for granted. In ontopoetics, a painting or a poem can capture reality better than common language or common perception because these apprehend it in its irreducible essence. In addition, these artworks are said to also coincide with metaphysical intuition. Ontopoetics argues for a model of ontological plurality. It suggests that all truths and realities are potentially but not exclusively true and real. In the Will to Power, where Nietzsche argued for the impossibility of truth, it was maintained that \\"there are no facts, only interpretations.\\" Ontopoetics stands in opposition to global perspectives (e.g. atomism and economism) due to its focus on field-concordance between psyche, meaning, and cosmos. It has been described as a fresh conception of the Cartesian split of external appearance and reality, problematizing it through a dialogic consciousness or poetics as ontology. Another conceptualization frames ontopoetics as a critique founded on the idea that the expression of being beyond what is representationally constructed as reality leads to the philosophical thought on art.  Friedrich Nietzsche  left Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that the world and existence are aesthetic phenomena in his deconstruction of truth. Ontopoetics is part of this aesthetic metaphysics of the world and the metaphysical aesthetics of art where the work of God as the artist-creator and its representation in the work of art are distinguished as first and second levels, respectively. These perspectives would later influence aspects of the philosopy of thinkers such as Martin Heidegger and Gilles Deleuze. Heidegger maintained, for instance, that truth can never be extracted from 'the sheer \\"not\\" of beings'. He subscribed to the Nietzschean idea that the world is a phenomenon that informs the ontopoetic conception of history. The application of the Nietzschean ontopoetics to art is based on a conceptualization of reality that includes elements hidden behind a \\"veil\\" created by the interplay of institutions and false needs. Art in this case articulates what the veil hides. Ontopoetics has also influenced a group of artists identified as concretists, who emphasize ontopoetic issues in their art, particularly when relating reality in itself. It is also evident in the works of Marcel Duchamp, which featured the notion of \\"event\\" and the application of \\"analogy\\" in his sculptures. His art took into consideration the onto-epistemic dynamics that lurk behind manmade structure-events, which invite the spectator to make the next move based on an analogy, assumption, or deduction. Ontopoetics in this approach is considered a constitutive and creative step.

He was held in honour by the Sufis and was called the \\"Sweet Basil of Hearts\\" (RayhƒÅn al-Qul≈´b). He is distinguished by his austerities and acts of self- mortification. He spoke in subtle terms concerning the practice of devotion. He developed the doctrine of gnosis (ma'rifa), and he was also the first to preach the science of 'time' (waqt) as essential for preserving one's state (hal) and allow hope to predominate over fear.  Name  'Abd al-Rahman b. Ahmad, or 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Atiyya al-Ansari al-Darani. He was called al- Ansari due to his connection with the Ban≈´ Anas ibn Malik, a tribe from Yemen.  Birth  He was born around 140/757 in a village in Damascus called Darayya, and hence he was known as al-DƒÅrƒÅnƒ´. Ibn Kathir praised him in his al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya, and said he was originally from Wasit, but travelled and lived in Damascus.  Death  He died in 205/820 or 215/830 and was buried in the village of Darayya in Damascus.  Quotes  Many of his sayings are purely mystical in spirit and expression. Among his sayings are: * \\"None refrains from the lusts of this world save him in whose heart there is a light that keeps him always busied with the next world.\\" * \\"Whenever a man on account of his actions is in despair of his future welfare, that despair shows him the way to salvation and happiness and Divine mercy. It opens to him the door of joy, purges away sensual corruption from his heart, and reveals to it Divine mysteries.\\" * \\"Whoever fills his stomach will have seven diseases: losing the sweetness of invocation, being unable to memorize the wisdom, losing sympathy with the creatures, if he is full he thinks that everybody else is, heaviness to worship, increase in lusts, and that while the rest of the believers go to the mosques, the full people go around the garbage dumpsters.\\" * \\"The origin of every good in this world and the Hereafter is fear of Allah; the key to the dunya is satiety; and the key to the Hereafter is hunger.\\" * \\"Never does fear part ways with a heart except that the heart is ruined.\\"  See also  * List of Sufis  References   External links  * Maqam (tomb) of Abu Sulayman al-Darani * Abu Sulaiman Darani * D√ÇR√ÇN√é ‚Äî ƒ∞sl√¢m Ansiklopedisi Category:Muslim ascetics Category:Salaf Category:Sunni Sufis Category:Sufi mystics Category:Deaths in Damascus Category:757 births Category:9th-century deaths ","title":"Al-Darani"},{"id":"65316911","text":"Kathy Bockus is a Canadian Progressive Conservative politician who has represented Saint Croix in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick since 2020.

History The street was first mentioned in 1346 as Lop Lane, and it later became known as Little Blake Street. Initially a very narrow street, the eastern entrance to St Leonard's Hospital lay on its north-western side. It was widened in 1785 to 15 feet, and then in 1864 to more than 100 feet. This led to the demolition of most of the existing buildings on the street, but some survive on the north-west side. Elsewhere, landmark late-Victorian buildings now line the road. In 1880, it was renamed \\"Duncombe Place\\", after Augustus Duncombe, the Dean of York. The street has a long history of Catholic worship, with a house, probably 7 Little Blake Street, occupied by a priest as early as 1688, and by 1764, 170 Catholics were meeting in a chapel there, dedicated to St Wilfrid. In 1806, it was sold to the freemasons, but the York Oratory was built on the street in 1864, the city's main Catholic church. The street is the main approach to York Minster for visitors arriving from York railway station. Layout and architecture The Dean Court Hotel The street runs north-east from the junction of Blake Street, Museum Street and St Leonard's Place, to the front of York Minster, where Petergate, Minster Yard and Precentor's Court meet. Almost all the buildings on the street are listed. The north-west side is dominated by the York Oratory, the city's main Catholic church, the other buildings being the Red House, built in 1714; the 18th-century Theatre House, with some 13th- century masonry in its basement; and the Dean Court Hotel. On the south side lie the former York Dispensary; the Crown Buildings, originally the city's probate offices; and the York Masonic Hall. There is also a garden containing the city's Boer War Memorial. On the north-west side of the street is a listed K6 telephone kiosk.

Known throughout the world for his art, he lived most of his life in Logan, Utah with his wife Yoko Yamakawa until his death on March 27, 1990.  Early life  Elsner was born in Gooding, Idaho in 1930 and was raised on his family's ranch. This environment had a profound effect on him, and he would bring these influences with him to his work. In 1948 he enrolled in the University of Idaho and graduated in 1951. Two years later, he joined the United States Navy. In 1955, he left the Navy and attended Utah State University, from which he graduated with a Bachelor's in Fine Arts in 1957. He then went to Columbia University where he studied under Oronzio Maldarelli, earning a Master's degree in 1958. In addition to these degrees, Elsner also studied metalsmithing at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and sculpture and pottery at the Archie Bray Foundation.  Professorship and professional artwork  In 1960, Elsner joined the faculty at Utah State, teaching anatomy, drawing, ceramics, metalsmithing, jewelry casting and sculpture. During this time, he worked on art projects of his own in bronze, stone, plaster, clay, metal and wood. He would often use his own work as a model for his students. As a product of his creative process, Elsner created hundreds detailed and precise sketched studies, some of which became artworks in and of themselves. These sketchbooks are currently stored in the Special Collections and Archives department of the Merrill-Cazier Library at Utah State University. A digital collection of many of these drawings can be found here in an exhibit in USU's Digital History Collections.  Interracial marriage and its effects  = In America = Logan, Utah was not unlike the rest of the states during the time of the Civil Rights Movement. As a result, the marriage of Elsner and Yoko Yamakawa was not well-accepted by the local community.A Qualitative Study of One Black Athlete: The Darnel Haney Story draft, in Utah State University historical materials (USU_RG 10.2), Box 54 Folder 9.

Accessed September 14, 2020. Some of Elsner's former friends would not speak to him because of his decisions, and although his wife was a skilled microbiologist, she was not able to get a professorship at the University. Her highest level of work was that of a research supervisor. = In Japan = Upon Elsner's first visit with his wife to Japan, he was welcomed warmly and treated very well. The Japanese people, especially in Tokyo, loved his sculptures, particularly because they were unglazed. His previous research in Chinese art forms and history had opened the door to more research into Asian art and Asian studies in general. These factors combined with his skill in sculpture and other art forms gave him the leverage he needed to open four one-man exhibits in Tokyo, each of them receiving critical approval. His visits to Japan led to an oriental influence on his art which was valued both in Japan and in America.  Awards  In 1962, Elsner won the Ford Foundation Purchase Award.

The islands are separated enough from Borneo to the south and Mindanao to the north that they have developed their own distinctive floral and faunal communities. Most of the original rainforest has been removed or disturbed for agriculture, and political instability in the islands has hampered conservation efforts.  Location and description  The islands are not the remains of a land bridge between Borneo and Mindanao, but rather are the product of submarine volcanoes. There are deep channels between the Sulus and the larger islands to the south and north, but the distances are not great. The current islands are low-lying and of coral limestone. The islands divide the Sulu Sea to the north from the Celebes Sea to the south. The islands are generally low lying, with the highest elevation being above sea level. Included in the ecoregion are the islands of Sibutu, Sanga-Sanga, Tawi- Tawi, and Panguan.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month.  Flora and fauna  The forest types on the islands include beach forest, mangroves, and lowland tropical rainforest. The beach forests feature Barringtonia, Caesalpinia, and Terminalia. Characteristic species of the lowland rain forest include Anisoptera, Dipterocarpus, Hopea, and Shorea.

The character was created by the show's co-creators Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond, and is voiced by Paula Burrows. Rayla is introduced as a prodigy, 15 year-old Moonshadow Elf assassin, and the apprentice of veteran Moonshadow elven assassin Runaan. Sent on a mission to avenge the Dragon King and Prince, she ends up siding with the human princes and half- brothers Callum and Ezran in order to deliver the Dragon Prince back to his mother. In the course of the series, Rayla and Callum develop a romantic relationship. Storylines =Background= Rayla is born on the 31 of July to Lain and Tiadrin. However, her parents are later recruited into the Dragonguard, an elite force of elven warriors sworn to protect the egg of the Dragon Prince. As a result, she was taken in by the assassin Runann and his husband Ethari. For years, Runaan trains Rayla to be an assassin like himself. Four months before the start of the series, the Dragon King, Avizandum is slain by King Harrow and Lord Viren. Frightened by this, the Dragonguard abandon their duty, apparently including Rayla's parents. This allows Viren to supposedly destroy the egg of the Dragon Prince. Ashamed of her parents' alleged cowardice, Rayla joins a small group of assassin on a mission to avenge the Dragon King and prince by killing Harrow and his son Ezran. =Book 1: Moon (2018)= Soon after arriving in Harrow's kingdom, Katolis, Rayla's team is discovered by a scout. She is sent by Runaan to kill him, but although Rayla manages to corner the scout, she hesitates upon seeing his fear, allowing him to escape. Fearful of Runaan's reaction, Rayla deceives him by staining her swords with deathberry juice. Per Moonshadow elven custom, Rayla and her fellow assassin literally bind themselves to their mission by tying ribbons round their wrists. Her deception is later revealed and Runaan takes her off the mission. Determined to make up for her mistake, Rayla sneaks into the castle to kill Harrow and Ezran, but finds Callum instead. To protect his younger brother, Callum lies that he is Ezran, but his deception is soon revealed when Ezran shows up. The two princes lead Rayla to Viren's secret underground room, where he has hidden the egg of the Dragon Prince. Rayla abandons her mission to kill Harrow and Ezran, deciding that since the Dragon Prince's egg survives, revenge is unnecessary. However, even when shown the egg, Runaan refuses to back down and Rayla engages her former mentor in a duel to protect the princes. The two seem evenly matched, but Runaan deserts the fight to focus on killing Harrow. Rayla, Callum, Ezran and Bait (Ezran's pet Glow Toad) flee the castle, resolving to take the Dragon Prince egg home together. As they escape, however, one of Rayla's ribbons falls off, symbolizing Harrow's demise, but Rayla doesn't tell the princes. Because Callum now has a Primal Stone (an orb containing magical energy), Rayla educates the prince on the six Primal Sources of nature. Callum asks Rayla to help retrieve a cube which has the Primal Sources' symbols on it, and Rayla agrees only reluctantly. However, while retrieving the mysterious item, Rayla is captured by the princes' elf-hating aunt, General Amaya. Callum, Ezran and Bait rescue Rayla, but are soon cornered by Amaya and her soldiers. Desperate, Callum lies that Rayla wants to kill him and Ezran, hurting the elf's feelings. Rayla pretends to hold Callum and Ezran hostage in order to escape. Rayla realizes that her remaining assassin ribbon is getting tighter and will continue to do so until her hand comes off. Whilst travelling on a boat, Rayla eventually admits that she is afraid of water, but overcomes her fear to save Bait from being eaten by a giant fish. Rayla then explains her reasons for being here. The next day, Rayla is attacked by Corvus, a soldier sent by Amaya to track them, and defeats him. Later, while travelling up a mountain, an argument between Rayla and Callum about the former's trustworthiness, coupled with a burp from Bait, causes an avalanche. The trio end up on an unstable frozen lake, where Rayla reveals the true nature of her wrist ribbon, but before she can reveal the death of Harrow, Callum desperately shoves the Dragon egg into Rayla's hands, causing her to drop it due to her dying hand. Ezran rescues the egg, but the freezing water leaves it severely weakened. Later, the group travels into a human town, where Rayla disguises herself as a human and unsuccessfully attempts to cut off her wrist ribbon with a Sun Forge blade, a super-heated dagger made by Sunfire elves. The group then travel up a mountain called the \\"Cursed Caldera\\" to find a mysterious \\"miracle healer\\". During the trip, they work together to slay a giant leech. The supposed \\"healer\\" turns out to be a female Moonshadow elf mage named Lujanne, who specializes in illusions. By unleashing the storm inside his Primal Stone, Callum manages to hatch the egg of the Dragon Prince, who then bites off Rayla's wrist ribbon. =Book 2: Sky (2019)= Though delighted to have both working hands again, Rayla wishes to move on immediately, but the others do not. Rayla is later attacked by Viren's children, Soren and Claudia, but the fight is stopped by Callum. Rayla distrusts Soren and Claudia, and suspects the former of trying to kill Ezran, but Callum doesn't believe her because he hasn't known her as long as Soren and Claudia. Feeling guilty, Rayla decides to tell Callum about Harrow's death, but Claudia does so first. Rayla's secret damages her friendship with Callum, but they reconcile after the latter finds himself unable to tell Ezran. Still mistrustful of Soren and Claudia, Rayla arranges a trick to reveal their treachery, and she, the princes, Azymondias and Bait escape. Later, the group hires a blind ex-pirate, Captain Villads to take them across an ocean.During the trip, Rayla admits to Villads that she doesn't believe being an assassin is for her. After finally making it to shore, Rayla and the group witness a dragon being shot down after burning a town. Wishing to break the cycle of revenge, Rayla goes to save the wounded dragon, and, aided by Callum using dark magic, helps her escape. Afterwards, Corvus arrives and reveals Harrow's death to Ezran, devastating him. Ezran goes off to grieve and Corvus soon goes after him, leaving Rayla, Zym and Bait to watch over Callum, who has gone into a coma as a result of using dark magic. As Callum's condition worsens, Rayla becomes increasingly distraught over the possibility of losing him. She is about to confess something to him, but is cut off when he wakes up. Callum reveals he can use sky magic again, thus becoming the first human to use primal magic on his own. Ezran leaves the group to take the throne of Katolis. Rayla, and Zym Callum continue their trek into Xadia, but find themselves face to face with an enormous dragon, which Rayla fearfully identifies as Sol Regem. =Book 3: Sun (2019)= Rayla reveals that Sol Regem is the former King of the Dragons, left a bitter and hostile shadow of himself after being blinded during the wars between humans and magical creatures. The trio attempt to sneak past the ancient dragon, but Zym's fearful whimpers expose their presence. Rayla reluctantly attempts to convince Sol Regem to let them pass, but the attempt fails when the dragon detects dark magic on Callum. The trio manage to outwit Sol Regem and finally make it into Xadia. Rayla, Callum, and Zym travel through Xadia, and the two teenagers grow noticeably closer. However, when they reach Rayla's birthplace, the Silvergrove, Rayla is devastated to learn that she has been made a \\"ghost\\", a magically cursed outcast, for abandoning her mission of assassination. They manage to make contact with Ethari, Runaan's husband, who gives them animal mounts in order to reach Queen Zubeia, Zym's mother, more quickly. They soon encounter a rogue Skywing elf named Nyx, who offers to guide the trio through the dangerous Midnight Desert. While the group takes a rest in the oasis, Rayla's grief over her banishment boils over, causing Callum to comfort her by giving a number of compliments. Unfortunately, Rayla mistakes the compliments for advances and kisses Callum, who in his surprise, accidentally rejects Rayla, angering her. The pair then discover that Nyx has stolen Zym. Rayla and Callum pursue Nyx, retrieve Zym from her and Rayla saves the Skywing elf from Soulfang serpents; cobra-like snakes which drain people's souls. Callum compliments Rayla for her courage, calling her a hero, and soon is lost staring into her eyes and kisses her. He then realizes he has gone to far and tries to move away, but Rayla forces him to kiss which he surrenders to happily, beginning their relationship. Rayla, Callum and Zym finally reach the Storm Spire, the mountain home of the Queen Zubeia, where they reunite with Ezran and Bait. When the group reaches the top, however, they discover Zubeia has gone comatose in her grief over losing her mate and her egg. When a repentant Soren arrives and warns them about Viren's invasion, Rayla decides to stay and protect the Dragon Queen as an act of redemption for her parents. Using moon magic, Callum learns that Rayla's parents actually stayed and fought until overpowered, and convinced Viren not to destroy Zym's egg, thus saving him. Joined by Amaya, Janai and the remnants of the Sunfire Elves' army, Rayla and her friends prepare to make their stand against Viren and his army of magically-enhanced soldiers. During the battle, Rayla stays in the Storm Spire to protect Zym. They are later attacked by Viren, who attempts to harvest Zym's power for himself. In an act of self-sacrifice, Rayla throws herself and Viren off the pinnacle. Callum leaps after them, developing the ability to fly and saving Rayla, while Viren falls to his death. As they fly back to the Storm Spire, Rayla and Callum finally confess their love for each other. Afterwards, Rayla, Callum and the others watch as Zubeia awakens and reunites with Zym. =Though the Moon (2020)= Approximately two weeks after the end of season 3, Rayla is now living in Katolis with Callum and Ezra. However, she is still troubled by the loss of her parents and Runaan, and doubts that Viren is dead, as his body was never found. The trio travel back to the Cursed Caldrea in order to perform a rebirthing ritual for Lujanne's pet Moon Phoenix. Rayla's dwelling on the fate of her parents, Runaan, and Viren puts a strain on her relationship Callum, who wishes to move on. However, Callum, remembering that the Moon Nexus can be used to enter a world between life and death, comes up with an idea to rebuild the Moon Henge to allow Rayla to enter it and find closure. Rayla agrees, abiet reluctantly after learning that the ritual involves swimming in water. With the help of a large and strong man named Allen, Lujanne's new boyfriend, they succeed in rebuilding the ruins and Rayla enters the portal. While inside, she encounters the spirits of her four fellow assassins, who attack Rayla for failing her mission. However, they allow her to proceed after they notice her missing binding and conclude that she has carried out her mission after all, despite Rayla's attempts to correct them. Eventually, Rayla discovers a large cocoon, which contains a sleeping Viren inside (unknown to her this is the cocoon of Aaravos's caterpillar familiar, which is apparently metamorphosing into a clone of Viren). The souls of fallen soldiers then attack Rayla and attempt to trap her in the world forever, but Callum manages to save her. Rayla reluctantly concludes that her family is gone. Although Callum tries to comfort her, Rayla confesses that she saw Viren inside a cocoon, and concludes that this means he is alive and must be stopped. Not wanting her to go alone, Callum insists they search for him together and Rayla promises him they will, before the two confess their love for each other once more. At night, however, Rayla remorsefully breaks her promise and departs alone. Development =Concept and creation= Rayla's early designs pictured her as too confident and had to be adjusted. Her early expression sheets also served as a practice for Wonderstorm's artists to figure out the four fingers of elven hands. In early concepts, Rayla had an additional marking on her forehead. It was Giancarlo Volpe's idea to put in Rayla's \\"Naruto-run\\" with encouragement from Lulu Younes. =Characterization and progression= Rayla is described as courageous and sharp-witted. Despite being raised to be an assassin and possessing all the skills required for the profession, Rayla is very moral and compassionate, and thus lacks the ruthlessness needed to take a life, especially the life of one who hasn't wronged her personally. Rayla initially has a rather Black-and-white perspective on the conflict between humans and magical creatures, but she later comes to view it in a more complex light. Rayla suffers from Aquaphobia; she is terrified of water and often gets seasick when she's on a boat. =Powers and abilities= In the world of The Dragon Prince, only magical creatures can use magic because they have magical energy within them. All magic originates from one of six Primal Sources; the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth, the Sky, and the Ocean. As a MoonShadow elf, Rayla is naturally connected to the moon, and while she has never been seen performing any spells, she can use her primal connection to assume her \\"Moonshadow form\\" during a full moon. In this form, she is nearly invisible. The novelization of season one reveals that Rayla rather ironically dislikes using this ability, as she finds it disorientating. Rayla is a master sword- fighter, especially with dual-blades, and is believed to be the fastest and strongest of her fellow assassins despite her young age. Rayla's weapon(s) of choice are a pair of twin blades that reflect her fighting style. These weapons were forged by her foster guardian Ethari, and are capable of switching between lethal blades and curved hooks even in mid-air, allowing her to catch an enemy off-guard. They are based on real-life balisongs or butterfly knives in their way to function. Reception Rayla has been generally praised by critics and fans. Swara Ahmed considered her the \\"best written\\" and most \\"compelling\\" of the three main protagonists, complimenting her internal conflict and determination to \\"get justice in her own way.\\" He believed audiences would form a connection to Rayla as soon as they saw her eyes. Ahmed considered her story \\"amazing\\" and found her journey with Callum and Ezran \\"entertaining.\\" Alex Barasch considered Rayla to be more \\"veiled\\" than Callum and Ezran. However, Rayla has been criticized by some people, and Paula Burrows' performance of the character has been generally mixed. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of The Daily Dot criticized Rayla's Scottish accent as \\"the worst part of the show.\\" Other people did like her accent, though some criticized it for being \\"inconsistent\\" and several others regarded it as \\"terrible.\\" References Category:The Dragon Prince characters Category:Female characters in animation Category:Television characters introduced in 2018 Category:Fantasy television characters Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Fictional female assassins Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Fictional child soldiers Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional bodyguards ","title":"Rayla"},{"id":"65317437","text":"Association pour le Droit des Femmes was a French women's rights organization, founded by Maria Deraismes and L√©on Richer in 1870.Charles Sowerwine: France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic, 2009 It was the first women's rights organization in France.

Conversely, cannabis use has been associated with intensity of trauma and PTSD symptoms. While evidence of efficacious use of cannabis is growing in novelty, it is not currently recommended.  Trauma as a motive  In a longitudinal study of American female twins, trauma and psychological symptoms were significant predictors for cannabis initiation and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD).Higher levels of life- threatening events, injury, or death and were also more likely to initiate cannabis use during the emerging adulthood phase, with sexual abuse predicting cannabis use initiation before the age of 15 in African-American women. In European-American women, sexual and physical abuse, as well as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) predicted age of cannabis initiation, with development of a CUD being predicting more specifically by MDD and physical abuse. Those with sexual trauma who initiate cannabis use prior to the age of 16, are also more likely to develop psychosis. In women military veterans, a higher proportion of cannabis users who had experienced childhood and adult sexual trauma, had higher levels Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis when compare to those with no drug use. When controlling for PTSD symptoms and demographic factors, regular cannabis use was still drastically related to sexual trauma. For sexual minority women, have indicated higher cannabis use, coping motives, and post-traumatic stress symptoms than heterosexual women. This may suggest that for women, trauma symptoms may be more severe for those who belong to a minority status, and the necessity to cope is often met by increasing cannabis use. These findings corroborate the idea that increased cannabis use can also be driven by minority stress, which has also been related to increased trauma.  Frequency and intensity of symptoms  High use of cannabis has been associated with coping motives in medicinal cannabis users with PTSD symptoms. Individuals with more cannabis use have been found to have increased overall cannabis use and higher instances of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD), suggestive of problematic cannabis use. For example, Veterans who identify as medicinal users have been shown to have a higher association with combat exposure, trauma related symptoms, arousal when cued to situations, as well as overall cannabis use. Despite increased cannabis use in those with PTSD symptoms, a National Epidemiological Study with thousands of participants based in the United States indicated lifetime PTSD was a weak predictor of lifetime cannabis use. However, this study affirmed that for individuals who endorse cannabis use and trauma exposure, they are likely to have concurrent PTSD and CUD symptoms. The strength of the association between heavy PTSD symptoms and CUD was stronger than that of CUD and other psychological disorders, namely depression, general and social anxiety, panic disorder, alcohol dependence, and personality disorders. It is worth noting that this was done with older DSM-IV criteria, rather than the most current DSM-V, suggestive of possible shifts in diagnostic criteria used to gauge psychological and substance related disorders.  Viability and use of cannabis as treatment  = Emotion regulation and anxiety symptoms =  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  Post- traumatic stress symptoms are seen to be related to coping-related motives of cannabis use, especially for emotional regulation. However, studies indicate the that with regular cannabis using veterans, problems with emotion regulation can trigger panic symptoms, especially when trying to quit use. Currently, it is indicated that psychoactive components of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is not effective in treating emotion-regulation and anxiety-related symptoms. Conversely, THC has been empirically related to an increase anxiety symptoms through impacts on neurological areas impacting serotonin, noradrenalin, GABA and glutamate.  Cannabinol (CBD)  However, when using cannabidiol (CBD) results have indicated a weakened emotional response to traumatic memories. This effect has been suggested due to the presence of endocannabinoid receptors in the limbic system, including the amygdala, and the hypothalamus that CBD may impact. The effect on these components likely lead to the reduction of neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responses. Altogether, a cumulation of research indicates cannabinoids can help with fear extinction and combating depression. However, further studies are needed to validate the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for emotion dysregulation and anxiety symptoms associated with trauma. = Sleep =  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  While, the psychoactive component THC, has been shown to reduce time to get to sleep, studies indicate disrupted circadian rhythms. Furthermore, THC has been shown to have a quickly developed tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects. It is worth noting synthetic THC has also shown the same effects of developed tolerance to sleep latency effects. Despite the aforementioned, individuals diagnosed with high PTSD scores have endorsed use of medical cannabis for sleeping. Studies have found some evidence for using Naboline, a synthetic version of THC, has proven effective for decreasing the frequency of PTSD related nightmares without developing long-term tolerance.  Cannabinol (CBD)  Novel research into cannabis suggests potential therapeutic effects of cannabinoids, specifically with higher doses of CBD, as opposed to lower doses which can have an energizing effect. In laboratory studies with rats, CBD has been shown to reduce sleep latency due to anxiety in REM sleep, and no negative changes to other aspects of sleep.

For example, the cat of the so≈Çtys was so smart that when given some coffee with milk, he drank all milk while leaving all coffee. It is unclear when and why WƒÖchock had become a butt of the jokes, although there are several theories.\\"WƒÖchock - Miasto ≈õmiechu\\"\\"Historia z dowcipem, dowcip z historiƒÖ\\", onet.pl, November 16, 2010\\"WƒÖchock, Pcim, Cyc√≥w, Hujowa G√≥rka i inne\\" Typically, the WƒÖchock jokes are the question-answer ones: \\"Why nobody in WƒÖchock watches TV now? - Because so≈Çtys put blinds on his windows.\\" There is a running joke \\"Let WƒÖchock be the capital of Poland!\\" (\\"WƒÖchock stolicƒÖ Polski\\"). In particular, this was one of the slogans of the Good Humor Party. \\"Madia na temat Partii Dobrego Humoru\\" However there is a little-known fact that for several days WƒÖchock was a de facto capital when during the January Uprising against the Russian Empire Marian Langiewicz, the leader of the uprising, had his headquarters at WƒÖchock. In 2003 the Monument of the So≈Çtys was unveiled in WƒÖchock by the police station. The so≈Çtys has a long moustache, he sits on a stone, donned in a hat and rubber wellingtons. With one arm he holds a horsecart wheel and a cell phone with another. \\"S≈Çynny so≈Çtys z WƒÖchocka bƒôdzie mieƒá sw√≥j pomnik\\"Pomnik so≈Çtysa w WƒÖchocku, Wyborcza.pl, September 3, 2003 The wheel hints to the joke on how the so≈Çtys of WƒÖchock is elected: a wheel is pushed off a hill and whichever house the wheel hits, its homeowner becomes soltys.\\"Jak so≈Çtys w WƒÖchocku sobie pogrywa≈Ç‚Ä¶\\" Since WƒÖchock regained its town rights in 1994, the title of its head is burmistrz, however the members of the \\"Friends of WƒÖchock Society\\" [Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç WƒÖchocka] established the title of \\"honorary soltys\\", traditionally elected since that year.

For example, burmistrz Jaros≈Çaw Samela has an idea how to capitalize on the joke, known in several versions, than when in WƒÖchock one needs to make a waist-high or a passport photo, one has to dig a hole of fitting size, step into it, and take a photo.

Traditionally his reign is said to have begun in 1437, but this results in an improbably long tenure and has been revised by modern research. Thomas Carlson puts the start of his reign in 1477, while David Wilmshurst places it about 1450. Shem øon's Arabic surname, Basidi, indicates that he or his family came from the village of Beth Sayyade in the vicinity of Erbil. According to a document from 1552: \\"A hundred years ago we had a patriarch who would only consecrate a metropolitan from among his own stock, clan and family, and his family has maintained that custom during the past century.\\" Shem øon IV has thus been see as the patriarch responsible for making the office hereditary. This he did by only appointing metropolitans from his family and designating his successor as natar kursya (guardian of the throne). A different picture from that of the document of 1552, which was drawn up by enemies of the patriarchal family, is painted by a note in a manuscript copied at Mosul in 1484 by the archdeacon Isho ø, who was attached to the patriarchate. According to him, \\"the Church was at peace, the convents and brothers enjoyed freedom, the ruined monasteries were restored, the degrees of priests and levites multiplied, and the faithful were blessed by the intercession of\\" the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Yaqub Beg. Another manuscript note from 1488, specifically states that Shem øon IV successfully intervened with Yaqub to have churches reopened in the eastern districts. Apparently, one of Yaqub's subordinates had begun enforcing the restrictive laws against Christians strictly sometime before 1484, leading the destruction and closure of many churches. Shem øon died on 20 February 1497 and was buried in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd near Alqosh, where he may have spent most of his patriarchate. An epitaph records his burial.

K. Rowling and published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The novel was released on 15 September 2020. Plot Troubled Blood begins in August 2013 and ends on Robin's 30th birthday on 9 October 2014. While visiting his terminally ill aunt Joan in Cornwall, Strike is approached by a woman who wants to hire Strike's firm to investigate the disappearance of her mother, Margot Bamborough, a general practitioner in London, almost 40 years previously, on 11 October 1974. As a result of their previous successes, Strike and Robin (still a salaried partner) now employ three contract investigators and an office manager. Both are dealing with their own irritations: Strike over his aunt's illness, suicide threats from his ex- fiancee Charlotte (now a married mother of two), and the attempts of his half- siblings to get him to attend a party honoring his rock star biological father Johnny Rokeby; Robin over Matthew's intransigence in their divorce, her continuing PTSD, and her unsettled personal life, brought into clearer focus by her brother and his wife having their first child. The police's principal suspect in Margot's disappearance was a currently incarcerated serial killer named Dennis Creed. The daughter (Anna) and her wife give the firm a one-year contract to try to trace information, although, because the small firm has three other ongoing cases, it takes several months to run down the surviving witnesses and investigators (or their children). During the year, Strike's aunt dies from cancer, Matthew grants Robin the divorce because his mistress/girlfriend becomes pregnant, Charlotte attempts suicide and calls Strike to tell him goodbye -- although Strike's quick reaction gets help to her in time, and the heavy work schedule combined with a lack of communication about all of the issues contributes to many personal misunderstandings within the firm, including arguments between Strike and Robin and the termination of one of the contract investigators for instances of inappropriate behaviour toward Robin. In August 2014, although the firm is still trying to trace leads, the client and her wife end the contract as of the end of August, two weeks before the allotted year. Despite this, Strike and Robin continue to investigate. There are three breakthroughs with the case: Strike locates an elusive patient of Margot‚Äôs, Steve Douthwaite; a receptionist, who claims she was the last person to see Margot alive, agrees to speak to Strike and Robin; and, through Robin‚Äôs inventiveness and persistence in attempting to secure an interview with Creed behind Strike‚Äôs back, Strike is granted permission to interrogate Creed in Broadmoor Hospital on September 14th. Strike outwits Creed and this leads to the discovery of the remains of another victim of Creed, Louise Tucker, bringing closure and relief to her father. Robin and Strike then use evidence from the original police investigation and their subsequent investigation to find Margot's body and identify her killer: Janice Beattie, a nurse who worked for Margot's practice. Margot had (correctly) begun to suspect Janice had been poisoning Steve Douthwaite and was implicated in the apparent suicide of Douthwaite‚Äôs lover. Strike deduces that Janice is a serial-killer, who has murdered many more victims over decades. An avalanche of publicity follows the discovery of the remains of Louisa Tucker and Margot Bamborough, and the arrest of Janice Beattie. Robin and Strike both move out of their homes temporarily to avoid journalists. The novel ends on Robin‚Äôs 30th birthday, with Strike (in contrast to the generic last-minute gifts he gave Robin at Christmas and on her 29th birthday) buying Robin thoughtful and personalised gifts and taking her to the Ritz for champagne; enigmatically, Strike smiles to himself as he remembers a conversation with a friend about the competing demands of career, romantic relationships and marriage. Characters =Main= *Cormoran Strike ‚Äì A private detective. He is a minor celebrity, thanks in part to his rock star father and his solving of high-profile murders. He is also a war veteran. *Robin Ellacott ‚Äì Strike's business partner, trained in criminal investigation.

Background Speaking after the release of the novel, Rowling described its main themes as \\"change, loss and absence\\" and that the book examines the \\"changing face of feminism\\". She also stated that the character of Dennis Creed was loosely based on real-life killers Jerry Brudos and Russell Williams.  Reception  In The Daily Telegraph, the reviewer Jake Kerridge complimented the novel's character development and pleasant reading, while finding it unnecessarily long and less exciting than previous books of the series. Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, gave the novel a positive review, pointing out its plot full of \\"simmering emotional tension\\" and \\"terrific fun\\", while acknowledging that it was excessively long and \\"hardly a hair-raising ride\\". Joan Smith in The Sunday Times said \\"the story is injected with a powerful sense of urgency...in this magnificent addition to the Strike novels\\". Tom Nolan, from The Wall Street Journal, deemed it \\"a formidable entertainment from the first page to the last\\". Kelly Lawler, reviewing for USA Today, called the novel a \\"laborious read\\" and \\"simply not good\\", paling in comparison to previous books in the series. Stephen King praised the novel, calling Rowling \\"a wonderful storyteller and a gifted stylist\\". Troubled Blood sold 64,633 copies in its first week and was the top selling book in the UK. This was the biggest single week of sales for any Galbraith title and almost double the launch-week volume of the previous Strike Lethal White. It retained the number one spot in its second week on sale, selling a further 25,430 copies. =Controversy= Some media outlets observed that the inclusion of a male villain who dresses as a woman in order to kill women was bound to be ill-received by part of the public, given the author's past comments on transgender people that were considered transphobic. Laura Bradley, reviewing in The Daily Beast, claimed \\"pernicious anti-trans tropes\\" in the novel, while Kerridge observed that the book's \\"moral seems to be: never trust a man in a dress\\". Nick Cohen, writing for The Spectator, argued that the transphobia accusations were baseless and slanderous, noting that Dennis Creed is investigated along with a dozen other suspects. He also stated that the book does not engage in the politics of women-only spaces and access to gender reassignment treatments. Alison Flood, writing for The Guardian, expressed similar views, arguing that people who have not read the book were making wrong assumptions based on a single review.

UConn's Nathan L. Whetten Graduate School was named in his honor in 1971.  Biography  Whetten was born on July 20, 1900 in Colonia Garc√≠a, a Mormon colony in Chihuahua, Mexico. His Anglo-American parents ran a cattle ranch. They moved back to Arizona in 1912 during the Mexican Revolution, returning to Mexico in 1914, where Whetten attended high school in Ciudad Ju√°rez. Whetten earned his bachelor's degree in languages in 1926 and his master's degree in sociology in 1928, both from Brigham Young University. After teaching at BYU and the University of Minnesota, he earned his doctorate in sociology from Harvard University in 1932. In the fall of 1932, Whetten began his postdoctoral career as a statistician in the University of Connecticut's sociology department, then part of the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station. He led the first study of suburbanization in Connecticut, focusing on the communities of Windsor, Wilton and Norwich. He was promoted to assistant professor of rural sociology in 1935 and to full professor and sociology department chair in 1938. Whetten also served as an editor of Rural Sociology and president of the Eastern Sociological Society and of the New England Conference on Graduate Education. Starting in the 1940s, Whetten's research interests shifted toward Latin American studies. From 1942 to 1945, he and his family lived in Mexico City, where he was on temporary assignment to the United States Department of State and the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations. He was charged with studying rural society in countries that provided raw materials (e.g., rubber) for the US war effort. He later conducted multi-month research trips to Guatelama in 1944, 1952, and 1955. Guatemala: The Land and the People (1961) and Rural Mexico (1948) were products of these expeditions. In 1940, Albert N. Jorgensen appointed Whetten the first Dean of the Graduate School, succeeding George C. White as coordinator of postgraduate education. As dean, Whetten oversaw all graduate degrees and courses offered by hundreds of faculty and dozens of departments. During his three-decade tenure, the Graduate School grew from nine master's and doctoral degree recipients in 1941 to 1075 in 1970. He retired on July 1, 1970. In November 1971, UConn's Board of Trustees voted to name the center for Whetten‚Äîthe first time a building was named for a living person. Whetten married Theora Lucile Johnson (1904‚Äì2004) of Salt Lake City in 1926. They met in college. Whetten lived in Storrs from 1932 until he died at a care home in Willimantic, Connecticut, on June 26, 1984. He was 83 years old. He was survived by his wife and two sons, Nathan and John. In 1998, Theora Whetten donated 24 acres of undeveloped land to Joshua's Trust, which now forms part of the Nate and Theora Whetten Woods nature preserve. She also created the Homer Babbidge Library's Whetten Endowment to purchase research materials on Latin America.

Typically, these relationships can be between people that consider themselves platonic friends without pressure. These non-committal relationships can be short term, or evolve into serious romantic relationships. In an era of one night stands, Netflix and chill, and booty calls, casual sexual relationships continue to become more prominent. Studies show an increasing number of college students, both male and female, report having a friends with benefits relationship at some point. FWB relationships are enjoyed by both women and men, this is in contrast to hookups which are more prevalent among men.  Background  The origin of the term \\"friends with benefits\\" is difficult to trace, although it is regularly used and practiced in today's society. The earliest known use of the term is documented in Alanis Morrissette's song Head Over Feet when she says, \\"you're my best friend, best friend with benefits\\". There is also the 2011 film, Friends with Benefits, starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Since then, the concept has become a phenomenon that is frequently referenced in pop culture and adopted by society. Research shows five different motivators for starting friends with benefits relationships: just sex (purely sexual motivation), emotional connection (the desire for increased closeness and/or intimacy), relationship simplicity (wanting an easy, natural, and stress-free relationship), rela¬≠tionship avoidance (purposeful avoidance of the exclusive and/ or romantic elements of a relationship), and wanted an FWBR (couples who ‚Äú...became single and took advantage of the opportunity‚Äù (Stein, Mongeau, Posteher, & Veluscek, pp. 318‚Äì319). The parties involved in FWB relationships enter it with the understanding that the relationship will end at some point in time. This differs from romantic relationships in that the unsaid goal of a romantic relationship is for the parties involved to stay in the relationship long term. Men tend to view FWB relationships as casual, while women tend to view them as friendships. Men are also more likely to have sexual relations with someone that they are not in a romantic relationship with. As FWB relationships continue to be a topic of interest, research on the subject is starting to lose its negative connotation. FWB relationships continue to grow in popularity amongst young people and older people without young children. = Third Wave Feminism = Often, women do not feel that their needs are being met in FWB relationships. Third wave feminism is the evolution of second wave feminism. Third wave feminism is the belief that \\"young women should not be inhibited either by traditional norms of sexuality that stigmatize female sexual experimentation in non-committed relationships, nor by a sense that one form of sexual practice is more ‚Äò‚Äòfeminist‚Äô‚Äô than another (Williams & Jovanovic, pp. 158).\\" Third wave feminism is more evolved and sexually expressive, third wave feminist defy the expectation that women's sexuality is simplistic. Third wave feminist also reject the notion that young women engaging in casual sex, FWB relationships, etc. should be labeled as \\"sluts\\". Arguments can be made by third wave feminists on both sides about the positives and negatives of FWB relationships. On one hand, FWB relationships allow women to explore their sexuality in an affaire de coeur that can be considered \\"safe,\\" even if it is non-committal, giving them the space to communicate their needs. On another another hand, FWB relationships may not help women navigate the full extent of their sexual agency without exploitation. = Affection Exchange Theory = Affection exchange theory states \\"individuals need to give and receive affection in order to survive and procreate.\\" When individuals are not a part of healthy relationships that allow them to show affection without question, then they have less anxiety in relationships. Although some FWB relationships can withhold affection, some FWB relationships can give individuals the opportunity to receive affection even if they are not in a committed relationship. Post sex communication like pillow talk, cuddling, and kissing can have positive outcomes. When this does not happen, individuals can harbor hostility. Research shows that relationships that don't have healthy communication post sex (like some FWB relationships) can experience attachment avoidance due to lack of affectionate communication. In order for individuals to feel sexual satisfaction, it is important to understand the attachment needs of the parties involved in the sexual relationship. = Self-determination theory = Stein et. al. claim that part of the allure of friends with benefits relationships ties into self- determination theory (SDT) (pp. 318). SDT delves into the human need to continuously search for new challenges. FWB relationships attract so many people because of the allure of the easy going non-committal relationship. The root of SDT is the need to have goals that are either approach focused, or avoidance focused. Approach focused goals are centered on what an individual can gain from a relationship, in a FWB situation this can be sex. Avoidance focused goals look at failures that can be avoided. In the case of FWB relationships, an individual can avoid a romantic relationship ending with a negative outcome. = Types of Sexual Relationships = Unlike more casual relationships (i.e. booty calls, one night stands, and other brief sexual encounters), FWBs continue to have a platonic relationship sans romance. Although it seems similar, FWB relationships differ from casual sex relationships in that FWB relationships are a commitment to continuous casual sex. One night stands are brief encounters with limited information exchanged. The parties involved typically part the next day without any additional communication. Booty calls are between people that are already acquainted, but not necessarily friends. Booty calls are usually recurring and don't develop into anything more. Sugaring involves exchanging gifts or money for companionship. = Challenges with Friends with Benefits Relationships = FWB relationships include friendship and sexual interactions without romance. In some ways, the success of this type of relationship is rooted in avoidance. Even with the rise in popularity in friends with benefits relationships, there is not a high success rate of continued friendship at the end of a friends with benefits relationship. Although these relationships are established to safely connect with a partner without the emotions, often these relationships are not genuine. Research on deceptive affection shows that people often hide their honest feelings because of concern that they will not be mutual or well received. Deceptive affection ends up being used as a tool to protect personal feelings so that no one gets hurt. Ultimately, these relationships continue to be complex despite the attempt to be void of emotions, the lines become blurred and feelings are sometimes developed by one partner that are not always well received by the other. There are many studies that examine how FWB relationships progress among college aged students. As FWB relationships continue to evolve, individuals involved often have changing motivations for why they continue the FWB relationships. The motivation for many of these relationships is typically companionship, after time the affection for the partners involved becomes genuine. Themes that emerged from one study on FWB at a university in southern California included \\"(1) FWB relationships as empowering to young women, (2) FWB relationships as not empowering to young women, (3) FWB relationships as providing a safe option in place of hook-ups, and (4) control and power in FWB relationships\\" (Williams & Jovanovic, pp. 167).\\" Another study proved that individuals that avoid attachment experience less sexual satisfaction in relationships, this study also found that there is correlation between attachment anxiety and sexual satisfaction.

The company has its largest base of operations in Ontario, but also has offices in western Canada. It serves 1.7 million customer households across Canada. Reliance is currently controlled by the family of Hong Kong-based Chinese-Canadian businessman Victor Li, through two of their holding companies, CK Asset Holdings (75%) and CK Infrastructure Holdings (25%).  History  Reliance has its origins in the storage water heater rental business formerly owned by natural gas utility Union Gas, which served much of Ontario. Reliance's main Ontario competitor, Enercare, has a similar origin as the rental business of Toronto-area utility Consumers' Gas. (The utility operations of both Union and Consumers' are now part of Enbridge.) Beginning in the mid-20th century, Ontario gas providers such as Consumers' and Union would work with home builders to pre-install gas-powered water heaters, which the providers would agree to subsidize and maintain in exchange for a monthly rental charge on each homeowner's gas bill. This practice of renting water heaters, as opposed to purchasing them, became widespread in Ontario, but is not common elsewhere in Canada. Due to regulatory changes, Union Gas' unregulated water heater business was split off in 1999 as a sister company named Union Energy. Union Energy was then acquired in 2001 by Epcor for about $160 million, then spun off as the UE Waterheater Income Fund in 2003. The fund was purchased in 2007 by Alinda Capital Partners for $1.74 billion. UE Waterheater, which later rebranded as Reliance, purchased security companies Voxcom and Protectron in 2007, operating them under the \\"Reliance Protectron\\" name until selling the operations to ADT in 2014. ADT Canada was subsequently acquired by Telus in 2019. Since the sale of Protectron, Reliance has refocused on home maintenance services, including expansion into western Canada. It also acquired competitor National Home Services from Just Energy in 2014. Reliance was then purchased from Alinda by the CK group in 2017 for $2.8 billion.  Products and services  In addition to water heater rentals (and sales in some areas), Reliance sells, rents, installs, and maintains furnaces and air conditioners. It also offers maintenance and repair plans for heating and cooling systems, as well as for plumbing and electrical systems.  Criticism  Although not specific to Reliance, the water heater rental business model has been noted as being a poor value for many consumers. The federal Competition Bureau has noted that purchasing a water heater outright \\"can result in substantial savings over time\\" compared to rental. However, Reliance and other rental companies argue that because their rentals include maintenance, including replacement parts and labour, they can provide peace of mind for consumers. The Competition Bureau filed complaints against Reliance and Direct Energy (then-owner of what is now Enercare) in 2012, alleging both companies engaged in anti-competitive behaviour by providing customers limited locations and time windows if they wished to return their rentals, and charging \\"unwarranted\\" cancellation fees. Reliance defended its policies, asserting that it was intended to help protect consumers against what it called aggressive tactics by competing rental suppliers. The company settled its part of the complaint in 2014 by agreeing to make it easier for customers to cancel their rentals and paying a $5 million administrative penalty.

Located at the intersection of 15th Street and West Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta, the project was unveiled in 2006 and promoted by Donald Trump in a 2007 season finale of The Apprentice. The project ultimately faltered, and the property was foreclosed upon in 2010.  History  The project began in March 2006, when Atlanta-based firm Wood Partners purchased the property at the intersection of West Peachtree Street and 15th Street (adjacent to the High Museum of Art) for $21 million. The firm partnered with Dezer Properties and planned it as a project under the Trump brand, with Donald Trump confirming his attachment to the project in August 2006. The Trump Organization claimed that Trump was neither the site owner nor the project's developer, and in their 2016 book Trump Revealed, authors Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher claim that Trump's involvement with the project was limited primarily to licensing his name for the project. The project would involve the creation of two curved glass towers, one 47 stories tall and one 38 stories tall, housing over 560 condominium units. A large sign bearing Trump's name was to be displayed over the lobby, and a design firm partially owned by Kenny Rogers was hired to design the interiors. In total, the project was expected to cost approximately $300 million. Phase I would have seen the construction of the taller of the two buildings at a cost of $260 million. On the season finale of the sixth season of The Apprentice, which aired April 22, 2007, the Atlanta project was presented as one of two projects that season's winner could choose from, alongside a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic, with the winner ultimately choosing the Dominican project. In the months following the announcement, advertisements were purchased in several publications, such as Atlanta, which highlighted Trump's involvement in the project. A September 2007 issue of Atlanta claimed that the project would near completion by 2010. However, by 2010, the site was in foreclosure, and it was sold at auction in 2012. In 2015, permits were filed to build a new apartment building on the site, which was completed in 2017.

Early life  Rita Cynthia Holt (later Huggins) was born in August 10, 1921 at Carnarvon Gorge, Queensland, the daughter of Albert and Rose Holt. They were of the Bidjara-Pitjara lands which encompasses part of the Carnarvon National Park. At an early age she and her siblings were separated from their extended family due to the official government policy at the time. Rita, her parents and some of her siblings went to live at Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve, in Barambah if they had light skin colour, while others were sent to Wooribinda if they had dark skin colour. She lived with her parents and attended school at Cherbourg from age 8-13, and then was removed to the girls dormitory. In 1934, Rita was sent into domestic service by the government, working on a property outside Charleville. She worked for the Semple family, who had been in charge at Cherbourg when they moved to Brisbane from 1941. She fell pregnant with her first child in 1942 and her daughter Marion or Mutoo returned to live with her parents at Cherbourg, while she continued in service. In 1947, Rita fell pregnant with her second child, Gloria and after the government granted her an exemption to move, she relocated to Mackay where she lived with friends Lear Barber and Ted Ram Chandra and worked for a doctor‚Äôs family. Homesick for her family, she returned to Cherbourg in 1950.  Marriage to Jack Huggins  Rita met soldier John ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Huggins during World War II when she was 18 and working in Brisbane. They married in 1951 and lived in Ayr, where he worked in the post office. They had three children together - Ngaire, Jackie and John. Jack died suddenly in 1958. Huggins moved her family to Brisbane where she took up employment again in addition to some support from Jack Huggins‚Äô superannuation fund and war pension. She found a place to stay in Inala, but alcoholism and financial hardship forced the family into temporary accommodation from 1969-1972. Friends offered her their farm in The Gap in which to live and they moved there between 1972 and 1987. Huggins took up research work for the University of Queensland in 1973 looking into Aboriginal education in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Upon her return to Brisbane she found that the younger children, who had been left in the care of their elder sister, Gloria, had all been in a car accident. Gloria was killed in the accident and many of the children seriously injured. Huggins took in Gloria‚Äôs children in 1976.  Work with the One People of Australia League  After Huggins relocated to Brisbane in 1960, she became involved with the One People of Australia League (OPAL) a non political organisation, which had formed in Brisbane in 1961, to help raise the living and educational standards of Indigenous Australians living outside of the missions and reserves. It was run by both European and Indigenous Australians. OPAL ran a hostel in South Brisbane, which Huggins and her family lived in before their move to a house in Inala. She became involved in the administration of OPAL, in particular the holiday camps, balls and dances as well as the fund raising and public speaking efforts. She was involved with the lobbying that OPAL took for the 1967 referendum. Much of the administration of OPAL was run from Huggins home, and she became director of OPAL for over 20 years, as they sought funding to establish the OPAL Joyce Wilding home, the Murri School at Acacia Ridge and the wider Indigenous community. Huggins died in August 27, 1996 in Brisbane and was celebrated at a funeral of over 1000 people. She was survived by her children and grandchildren. The story of her life was written with her daughter Jackie Huggins, and Lillian Holt and published in 1994 ‚Äì Auntie Rita. The book won the Stanner Award.

The first, Ultima Online: The Second Age, arrived in 1998. The most recent expansion pack is Ultima Online: Time of Legends (2015). Expansion packs =The Second Age= Ultima Online: The Second Age was the first expansion for the Ultima Online MMORPG. The expansion added several features to the game, including a new region called the Lost Lands, new creatures, and support for player-built cities. =Renaissance= Ultima Online: Renaissance is the second expansion to the popular Ultima Online (UO) MMORPG. Released on May 4, 2000, it added content, fixed bugs, and made gameplay changes in response to common player complaints. Prior to its release, the expansion was said to double the amount of room in the game, but that it would not use a duplicate of the map, rather it would be adding new content. It was later found in the previews that Renaissance simply added a mirror world under different rules. The current map became Felucca and Trammel was created, the first one with \\"player vs. player killing\\" allowed, and the second with only consensual combat. =Third Dawn= Ultima Online: Third Dawn, released in 2001, introduced 3D models to the Ultima Online MMORPG franchise. While the game still maintained its scaled, overhead view, the character animation was much smoother. With the introduction of the Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn client (a more sophisticated 3D Ultima Online client), the Third Dawn client is obsolete, and no longer usable on official shards. Even the original Ultima Online client uses a height map for terrain and three dimensions for item and character location within the world, but the newer \\"3D Client\\" introduced with Third Dawn included 3D models for all creatures. It still, however, maintains use of 2D artwork for objects. While it has an option to zoom in, it does not allow for any rotation due to the 2D artwork still incorporated, and the way the map is constructed. Some of the 2D artwork (especially walls and trees) were improved noticeably. Ultima Online: Third Dawn received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 69% rating on Metacritic. GameSpot rated the game a 6.9 of 10 saying \\"Despite Third Dawn, Ultima Online still isn't easy to get into; it's an acquired taste, which many acquired back when there was nothing else available or similar.\\" =Lord Blackthorn's Revenge= Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge (2002) was the first of the two \\"darker\\" Ultima Online MMORPG expansions (the second being Ultima Online: Age of Shadows). The game featured creatures designed by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn in comics). The story tells about the return of Lord Blackthorn, the corrupt noble who usurped the throne of Lord British in Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny. Included in the game box was a comic drawn by McFarlane. The game was announced to be in development on October 31, 2001. Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge holds a 66% rating on GameRankings. GameSpot rated the game 6.7 of 10. GameZone rated the game 8.1 of 10 saying \\"Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn‚Äôs Revenge has added some very strong elements to this world, making it more enjoyable and not just the hack-and-slash game it could have easily become\\". =Age of Shadows= Ultima Online: Age of Shadows is the fifth expansion pack for the popular MMORPG Ultima Online. It was released on February 11, 2003 and was the last title by developer Origin Systems. Age of Shadows introduced a new landmass to the game called Malas. Malas was designed to appear as a broken continent, with various islands and pieces of land separated from each other and connected only with bridges. The pieces of land were surrounded by stars, suggesting that Malas floats somewhere in space above the rest of the Ultima Online worlds. The main purpose of Malas was to provide more land for player housing. Players had complained that limited open land was causing an unreasonable amount of price inflation in the community, and restricting younger players from owning houses until they had played for many months. The greatly increased land that Malas provided helped to lower the cost of housing, and gave more players the opportunity to own a home. New item attributes and properties were added with the expansion. The new attributes allowed for hundreds of combinations of items, a drastic change from the limited possibilities before. Four elemental properties were part of the change: fire, cold, energy, and poison. If the elemental properties were high enough, items changed color to reflect elemental power. This change produced a variety of items such as blue broadswords, and orange katanas, which caused upset with traditional players who claimed that the unrealistically colored weapons detracted from the authenticity of Ultima Online (see: Criticism). Two new character classes were added with Age of Shadows. The new Paladin character class consists mainly of the new Chivalry skill. If used in conjunction with a \\"Book of Chivalry,\\" a Paladin using the skill can perform powerful techniques, such as curing poison in battle, or teleporting to a new location. These types of magical abilities were previously restricted to mages. In order to perform Chivalry techniques, a Paladin must tithe gold to a shrine in exchange for \\"tithing points.\\" The new Necromancer character class was introduced along with 16 Necromancy spells. Necromancy requires a separate group of reagents: Bat Wing, Grave Dust, Daemon Blood, Nox Crystal, and Pig Iron. Reception On the review aggregator GameRankings, the expansion received an average score of 71% based on 12 reviews. On Metacritic, it received an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 6 reviews -- indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" The months following the release of Age of Shadows saw a significant exodus of veteran players from Ultima Online. Many players insisted that the new brightly colored items detracted from the game's atmosphere strongly. A further, more serious criticism, was that the new item system broke Ultima Online's long-standing tradition of being skill-based in favor of an item-based system. This was exacerbated by the fact that the expansion's release roughly coincided in time with an increase in the subscription fee. =Samurai Empire= Samurai Empire is the sixth expansion to the Ultima Online MMORPG, featuring an oriental- themed environment, allowing players to play archetypical characters the Samurai and Ninja. It also added a new area named the Tokuno Islands. It was developed and published by Electronic Arts and released on November 2, 2004. =Mondain's Legacy= Mondain's Legacy is the seventh expansion to the Ultima Online MMORPG, featuring a new playable race, elves, along with a new skill and several new dungeons. This expansion focused content more on existing and veteran players, rather than trying to draw new players. It was also the first UO expansion to only be available via digital download instead of the traditional retail box. =Stygian Abyss= Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss is the eighth expansion pack for the 1997 MMORPG Ultima Online. The expansion was announced prematurely on the Japanese Ultima Online website. It was originally slated for release in the summer of 2007, but expected after 2008. On August 12, 2009, the official release date of September 8, 2009 was announced by Electronic Arts. Ultima Online Stygian Abyss, was \\"re-announced\\", this time with art and storyline. UO Herald states that more information will be forthcoming in upcoming months. Features * Gargoyle Race - A new player race. One ability includes being ably to \\"fly\\" (cross certain obstacles and move at mounted speed). Gargoyles can not learn Archery skill or use bows. * Ter Mur - The Gargoyle homeland. Players will be able to place houses in this area. * Stygian Abyss Dungeon - The largest and most intricate dungeon added to date. Based on the one seen in Ultima Underworld, the entrance is found on Fire Island on both facets. Creatures found inside include the Medusa, Primeval Lich and the Stygian Dragon. There will also be non- consensual player vs player combat areas inside the abyss. * Imbuing - A new crafting skill that allows players to manage the properties added on a crafted weapon or armor piece.

Can only be learned by Gargoyles. * Housing Tiles - Nine new sets showing off the style of Gargoyles. =Time of Legends= Ultima Online: Time of Legends was released in 2015. New Areas: Shadowguard and Valley of Eodon; two new champion spawns; —Åompleting the virtue system; many new items; new skill-masteries; updates to classic housing. Booster packs =High Seas= Ultima Online: High Seas is the first booster pack for the 1997 MMORPG Ultima Online. Ultima Online: High Seas, was announced during a UO Town Hall Meeting held on August 28, 2010 at EA Mythic/Bioware's division headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia.

Synopsis The novel tells the story of Piranesi, who lives in a place called the House with one other man, named the Other. Piranesi works with the Other in search for \\"A Great and Secret Knowledge\\" hidden within the House. He records his findings in detailed entries in his journal. Piranesi begins to notice strange messages appearing which call into question his record of the world in which he lives. A sinister truth is uncovered as evidence suggests the existence of another person and another world outside of the House. Publication Piranesi was published in hardback, e-book and audio format on 15 September 2020 by Bloomsbury Publishing. The audiobook version is narrated by actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. Reception Piranesi received reviews of unanimous admiration. Sarah Ditum of The Times gave the novel a rave review, writing, \\"After all that time, she has produced a second novel that is close to perfect.\\" Ron Charles of The Washington Post called it \\"infinitely clever\\" and praised Piranesi's acceptance of his imprisonment for unintentionally making the novel \\"resonate with a planet in quarantine\\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Publishers Weekly called it an \\"inventive\\" novel, praising Clarke's subtlety in progressing the novel's storyline. Allusions to Narnia Piranesi contains several references or allusions to C. S. Lewis's series The Chronicles of Narnia. When describing the character Dr. Valentine Andrew Ketterley, the text notes that he is the son of a \\"Ranulph Andrew Ketterley\\" and that \\"the Ketterleys are an old Dorsetshire family.\\" Both the names and the description of the family are evocative of Andrew Ketterley, a key figure in The Magician's Nephew who describes his family as \\"a very old family. An old Dorsetshire family.\\" This connection is further strengthened by the quotation from The Magician's Nephew given at the front of the novel, which was also spoken in that book by Andrew Ketterley. In the \\"Statues\\" entry of Part I, the narrator of Piranesi notes that he dreamt of a faun \\"standing in a snowy forest and speaking to a female child,\\" likely a reference to Lucy Pevensie meeting the faun Mr. Tumnus in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In addition, there are several similarities between the House of Piranesi and the so-called \\"Wood between the Worlds\\" of The Magician's Nephew. Both are alternative worlds (distinct from our own) that must be reached through supernatural means, both contain life but of a less variegated nature than that in the characters' original worlds, and both induce a state of forgetfulness in newcomers that induces them to believe that they have always been in the new, supernatural, world.

It was a ministerial by-election, triggered by the appointment of Liberal Party member of parliament Richard Dowse as Solicitor- General for Ireland. The election was strongly contested by the Irish Conservative Party at a time when such by-elections were increasingly unchallenged. During this period the Catholic population of Londonderry tended to support the Liberals while the Protestant population supported the Conservatives. Dowse won, with a slightly reduced majority, and the result has been cited as evidence for the increasing co-operation between Episcopalian and Presbyterian voters in Ulster.  Background  Richard Dowse was a Liberal Party politician who was first elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for the Londonderry City constituency at the 17 November 1868 general election. At this election he had defeated his only rival, the Irish Conservative Party's Claud Hamilton, by 704 votes to 599. A lawyer by profession Dowse was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in February 1870 which, under the law of the time, triggered a ministerial by-election. The election was scheduled for 15 February and Dowse faced a strong challenge by the Conservative Party's Robert Baxter, at a time when ministerial by- elections (abolished in 1926) were increasingly uncontested.  Results  Dowse was re-elected, receiving 680 votes compared to 592 received by Baxter. The vote in Londonderry at this time was usually sectarian with the numbers of Protestant and Catholic voters directly correlating with support for the Conservative and Liberal parties respectively. The 1870 result was regarded as indicating an increasing co-operation between Episcopalian and Presbyterian voters in Ulster. This was the last parliamentary election in the constituency before the introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 and registers of all the voters for each elector are still held on record. Dowse stood down as member of parliament in 1872 to take up a position as Baron of the Exchequer, the resulting by-election saw the loss of the seat to the Conservatives as some Liberals switched their support because of the Liberal candidate's record in government and the party's education policy.

It was held in the wake of the 2020 Democratic National Convention and 2020 Republican National Convention on August 30, 2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was held as a virtual event. The intent was to create a new American political party, stating that \\"Wall Street has two parties and the People have none.\\" The event was viewed live by over 400,000 people and was trending throughout its five- hour duration despite the concurrent 2020 NBA playoffs and the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards. 12,000 registered participants were able to vote using an app available on iOS and Android. By the end of the presentation, 99.4% had voted in favor of creating a new political party; the People's Party. After voting to create the party, an assumed result, a supplement at the end of the program was a group of localized organizers laying out a structure for building the party. Speakers Many of the proponents of this idea come from the online social media world. The event had been promoted under the hashtag #demexit as many were frustrated with the failure of the Democratic Party to address isues associated with the campaigns of Bernie Sanders. While many expressed frustration with the choices in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, the plan was to create alternatives to that in the future. The convention was covered live on numerous social media platforms including Jimmy Dore's YouTube channel and replay is available. See the entire .

Branna served as the Master of Ceremony of the event, introducing videos and each of the speakers. He also remarked how this convention was organized and publicized over the course of three weeks. He said it was saying \\"what should have been said\\" one and two weeks earlier (during the Republican and Democratic conventions).

Until we excise that tumor from the body, that's cancer's going to do nothing but linger. I'm here to talk today about our politics in this country. As many of you know, as I know, as anybody watching this knows, our politics is beyond broken. It is broken on both sides, Republican and Democrat. The audacity of both parties in this country to tell women when they can and cannot use their constitutional rights over their body.

It is time for us to stand up and make our voices heard. =Eleanor Goldfield= *Eleanor Goldfield is a poet, who targets communicating to the young adult demographic with her artkillingapathy.com website and co-hosts the \\"Common Censored\\" podcast with Lee Camp :::Through a trembling hand, I can write poetry. :::With aching arms, we can build. :::Through tired eyes, we can see. :::With the weak knees, we can fight. :::In topping empires, we can rest. :::In these cramped corners, we can make world. :::We are historic. :::We are futuristic. :::We are placeholders for infinity. :::We won't be here again, but we are here now. :::in these strange days and in these strange ways. :::You can stop us like you can stop a sunrise. :::Seeds will grow and others will burn. :::That fire inside is your ancestral guide. :::Call on it now. =Jamarl Thomas= *Jamarl Thomas is a podcaster, the host of \\"The Progressive Soap Box\\" :::Neither one of these parties are dealing with the real concerns of the populations. Both parties have realized that basically, because there's only two, both can be captured by corporate class. Both can have similar interests, powered by people who are putting money in their pockets, sliding their credit cards through their budget. This is our politics. We accept it. There is no way out in a political system. The only way out is to extricate yourself from the political party. Stand under the banner of policy. Do you realize that we drag Medicare for All over the burning corpses of 20 Democrats. All of them taking a shot, all of them doing whatever they can to poke holes in that policy and we win. 88% per cent support in the context of the party . . . If you can't get it over the finish line, with Biden, Pelosi, Schumer telling you to kick rocks . . . The only strategy is to leave. And to stand under the banner of policy and to make a demand. =Ron Placone= *Ron Placone is a comedian and podcaster, host of \\"Get Your News On with Ron\\" :::This is by design. The Republicans are one of the greatest existential threats to mankind . . . The only way they are able to be this horrible is because of how ineffective the democrats are. And vice versa. They need each other. And that's bipartisanship . . . We are here to say it's time to end the duopoly. We are here to say it's not radical to demand the type of healthcare systems, the rest of the industrialized world takes for granted. It's not radical to say act bold on climate change and demand change now with a Green New Deal and it can't wait. It's not radical to say anybody working 40 hours a week at an honest job deserves a living wage. It's not radical to say we need to look out for the most vulnerable among us. It's not radical to say that education should be for everyone and not just for the elite. It's certainly not radical to say it is time to end the wars and end them now. =Maebe A. Girl= *Maebe A. Girl lays claim to being the first drag queen elected to public office and a former congressional candidate ::: I'm sure you have noticed that the two party system is not working for everybody. In fact, it's only working for corporate America and the wealthy elite. Big business does not care if you're a Democrat or Republican. Big business knows that leaders of both parties are working to enhance the corporate agenda rather than the agenda of the people . . . It's time to disband the functional two-party system that perpetuates greed and corporate influence in American politics. It's we, the people, that hold the power. And the elites are doing everything they can to make sure that we don't realize that. True progress for the people cannot be achieved until we form our own party.

Which one of those candidates and which one of those parties represent that? Out of curiosity, or any other choices that you're offering me declining money from the largest lobbying groups in the country? APAC. Which one of those of those candidates are speaking up about the open market slavery that we are seeing in Lybia as a result of one of those candidate's administration? Which one of those candidates, in a time of pandemic, are pushing for the most popular policy choice in the country? Medicare for all . . .

Which one of those candidates deny corporate money and corporate payoffs? =Massey Branscomb= *Massey Branscomb, Humanity First :::If money is supposed to represent how much we have contribute to society, we can see that our ability to make an impact and do good grows exponentially with our resources. We owe it to our children to make sure that we all have that ability to grow. :::We as a people must focus on who and what we are fighting for and fighting against. We are fighting against corruption; against greed; against an oligarchic society. We are fighting for good. A common morality to help others so they can help many more . . . America's great not because it's always been good but because we have always driven to be better. =Scott Santens= *Scott Santens is the editor of Basic Income Today and is a Basic income advocate :::Extraordinary weather events are normal. 180,000 dead Americans and 1,000 more dying every day from coronavirus is normal. One million Americans newly applying for unemployment benefits every week is normal. Being killed by police as a black man is normal. Congressional gridlock is normal. The president eroding faith in our institutions is normal. What's become normal is not OK. None of this is OK. What we are doing in America isn't working. America is not working. It's time to draw a line . . . We can't just vote for different leaders. We have to change how we vote and voting has to exist upon the foundation of fundamental human rights. We all have a right to life. That is a fundamental human right. We have never truly recognized it. No one really has the right to life as long as someone else from a cold gated community can withhold what is needed to live. Within a monetary system of private property, money is oxygen. So we all have an unconditional right for enough money to live. That is why I believe is the most important structural change of all is an income for all. Or every American will work every month above the poverty line and never far below it. It's a structural change that removes barriers to others structural changes. It's a foundational floor for everything else we need to do. =Jesse Ventura= *Jesse Ventura is the former Independent Governor of Minnesota :::My history is I have always been third party. Full stop.

As Governor Ventura was saying, it's never them who have to go die. I say this as a Native American, as an American Indian, on whom . . . American citizenship was imposed in 1924. We went and fought and died for this country . . . witness unarmed water protectors, unarmed protesters who are trying to defend all of our rights to free speech, our right to peaceably assemble, or rights to be free from illegal searches and seizures.

These parties both have policies that are based on the same kind of racism, the same kind of immortality, that we see unleashed against black and brown people here at home. We desperately need for ourselves, and for those of victims . . . we need a party that is not in the clutches of the military-industrial complex of the military contractors. A party that can push our foreign policy in a radically new direction . . . save $1.3 trillion that both parties have allocated to \\"modernize\\" our nuclear weapons.

Targeting each other . . . I have been seeing my people being divided and constantly attacking one another and this is not something I sacrificed my youth to make happen. I went to Iraq, I gave up some of the best years of my life to ensure that my people didn't have to suffer through tyranny. And I come back here and I see there is tyranny going on right now. What I see right now is that my people do not have representation. I see right now that the leadership of this nation does not give a damn about my people across the entirety of this nation. The only thing they care about is maintaining their power and ensuring that they stay on top of their money. That is their one and only priority . . . Right now I'm going to deliver unto you a message from veterans of the People's party.

In fact, we weren't even black people before we were brought to America. So the entire existence of black people both parties have failed us tremendously. So that would be one good reason to start a new party . . . The Democratic Party pretends to like us. Pretends we're people that they want us to support like they have our backs meanwhile they don't have any policies that help our communities. They support policies that take resources out of our communities and all of it is lip service. Why do we support this party? Its because the Republican Party is even worse than that when it comes to black folks.

We are seeing unarmed black people being murdered by the police. We are seeing an immoral and rigged economy where billionaires like Jeff Bezos make 13 billion dollars in a single day, while normal people struggling cannot make real wealth. And rather than meet this moment of great struggle with bold policies and solutions to move our nation forward, both corporate parties in Washington are doing what they do best; putting their corporate donors over the basic needs of the American people. And we need to be very clear some about this. Because one of the corporate parties likes to sedate us with platitudes of hope and change but make no mistake, they are bought and paid for by the same big corporations and oligarchs as at the other corporate party in Washington. =Marianne Williamson= *Marianne Williamson is an author and was 2020 Presidential candidate :::There is more truth telling at this convention, in my opinion, than there was at either Democratic or Republican convention. We kind of like . . . being raised in an alcoholic home where mommy or daddy are not saying the truth of what's really going on and that there is all this agitation in the air. That's what I feel like is going on in this country. We all know things are going on and they're not being discussed and that should be the purpose of political parties.

Chen, born in 1968, is an American biological engineer. He is the William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University and member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University in Boston. Chen has published over 250 research papers. His research investigates the application of engineering principles to control tissue assembly, repair and regeneration, and incorporates areas including nanotechnology, tissue engineering, engineered cellular micro-environments, micro-electromechanical systems and micro- fabrication technologies. Chen has been awarded numerous awards and distinctions such as ONR Young Investigator Award in 1999, the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2000,  Education  Chen completed his Bachelor‚Äôs in Biochemistry from Harvard University in 1990, where he conducted research on integrin receptors and biomechanics of running. After spending a year abroad, he joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his Master‚Äôs in Mechanical Engineering in 1993. He then joined the M.D.-Ph.D. program run by the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST). He completed his dissertation research with Donald E. Ingber and George M. Whitesides on \\"Engineering the adhesion of cells to substrates\\", and received a Ph.D. in 1997 and an M.D. in 1999.  Career  Chen joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University as an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering and in Oncology in 1999. In 2004, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as the inaugural J. Peter Skirkanich Professor of Innovation in Bioengineering, founded and directed the Penn Center for Engineering Cells and Regeneration, and was a founding member of the Penn Institute for Regenerative Medicine. In 2013, Chen joined Boston University as Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. In 2019, he was appointed the William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University, the highest distinction bestowed upon senior faculty members at Boston University. Chen has been a member of numerous advisory boards, committees and review groups of organizations such as the Society for BioMEMS and Biomedical Nanotechnology, the United States Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Defense Sciences Research Council, and Faculty of 1000 Biology. Chen also holds several leadership positions at the interface of engineering, biology, and medicine, including the founding Director of the Boston University Biological Design Center, the Deputy Director of a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center focused on integrating nanomanufacturing, cellular engineering, and regenerative methods to create personalized fully functionalized heart tissue, and co- Principal Investigator on the National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center on Engineering Mechanobiology. Chen has served as Editor or Editorial Board member for numerous scientific journals, including Science Translational Medicine, Developmental Cell, Cell Stem Cell, Annual Reviews in Cell and Developmental Biology, Cell and Molecular Bioengineering, Technology, and Journal of Cell Science.  Research and work  Most of Chen‚Äôs work is at the interdisciplinary research interface between engineering, biology, and medicine. Chen‚Äôs main areas of research is in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, where he has made contributions in cellular microenvironments, tissue assembly, and vascular biology. Throughout these studies, he has worked on the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnologies to reveal how cellular organization, mechanics, and adhesive interactions control cellular function. = Cellular microenvironments = One of Chen‚Äôs major research areas is on the interactions of cells with their surrounding microenvironment. He has articulated that not only biochemical, but also physical cues, stimulate signaling that directs cellular behaviors. His published works have highlighted the importance of cellular adhesion to surrounding extracellular matrix scaffold, adhesion to neighboring cells, and forces transmitted through those adhesions in regulating responses such as cell proliferation, stem cell differentiation, and multicellular organization. He has developed microfabrication and nanotechnology approaches to show how the geometric patterns of adhesive interactions, and whether those interactions are planar or in three-dimensional space, can dramatically impact how cells respond. In defining a role for mechanical forces in these events, he has described the development of several technologies to measure these cellular forces. = Tissue assembly = Chen has used his insights in cellular microenvironments to develop strategies to engineer tissue assembly. He has advocated that these synthetic tissues can serve not only as implantable therapies but also as surrogates of human tissues in pharmaceutical and translational research. Chen has demonstrated how the shape of multicellular aggregates can be used to direct patterns of bone versus fat differentiation in engineered tissues. His works report the use of microposts as physical anchors to guide the formation of aligned micro-scale tissues, and has used these systems to build tissue mimetics of stroma, skeletal muscle, airway and vessel muscles, and cardiac tissue. Chen also has reported on the development of microfluidic platforms where cells line perfusable channels, including 3D printing techniques to create a framework for a synthetic vascular system that consists of a lattice of sugar, with the goal of supporting larger tissue structures such as an artificial heart or liver. He has used these to model capillary vascular beds that can feed a 3-dimensional culture in the same way that blood vessels feed a tissue, as well as other luminal tissues such as bile ducts. He has used these vascular models to study cellular interactions with vasculature, most notably in cancer. = Vascular biology = Chen‚Äôs scientific work has led to new insights in the biology of the blood vasculature. Chen published an article in 2016 about forces in vascular biology. His research concludes that there is a significant effect of environmental and cell-generated forces on endothelial behavior, and he proposed new concepts about endothelial force sensing and mechanical signaling. In his own studies, he has reported on the importance of the physical properties of the extracellular matrix, cellular interactions with matrix and other cells, and mechanical forces in impacting how endothelial cells signal and organize to form vascular networks. He discovered a role for tugging forces at cell-cell junctions and shear stresses of blood flow in regulating the barrier between blood and tissue compartments. In addition to fundamental studies in vascular biology, Chen has also advanced numerous technologies to promote vascularization for treating ischemic diseases and engraftment of engineered tissues. He has shown that pre- templating vascular cords and channels within artificial grafts leads to rapid vascularization and perfusion of such grafts upon implantation.

Geodetic graphs were introduced in 1962 by √òystein Ore, who observed that they generalize a property of trees (in which there exists a unique path between each two vertices regardless of distance), and asked for a characterization of them. Although these graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, \\"more than sixty years later a full characterization is still elusive\\". Examples Every tree, every complete graph, and every odd-length cycle graph is geodetic. If G is a geodetic graph, then replacing every edge of G by a path of the same odd length will produce another geodetic graph. In the case of a complete graph, a more general pattern of replacement by paths is possible: choose a non-negative integer f(v) for each vertex v, and subdivide each edge uv by adding f(u)+f(v) vertices to it. Then the resulting subdivided complete graph is geodetic, and every geodetic subdivided complete graph can be obtained in this way. Related graph classes A block graph, a special case of a geodetic graph The Petersen graph, one of the geodetic graphs of diameter two If every biconnected component of a graph is geodetic then the graph itself is geodetic. In particular, every block graph (graphs in which the biconnected components are complete) is geodetic. Similarly, because a cycle graph is geodetic when it has odd length, every cactus graph in which the cycles have odd length is also geodetic. These cactus graphs are exactly the connected graphs in which all cycles have odd length. More strongly, a planar graph is geodetic if and only if all of its biconnected components are either odd-length cycles or geodetic subdivisions of a four-vertex clique. Computational complexity Geodetic graphs may be recognized in polynomial time, by using a variation of breadth first search that can detect multiple shortest paths, starting from each vertex of the graph. Geodetic graphs cannot contain an induced four-vertex cycle graph, nor an induced diamond graph, because these two graphs are not geodetic. In particular, as a subset of diamond-free graphs, the geodetic graphs have the property that every edge belongs to a unique maximal clique; in this context, the maximal cliques have also been called lines. It follows that the problem of finding maximum cliques, or maximum weighted cliques, can be solved in polynomial time for geodetic graphs, by listing all maximal cliques. The broader class of graphs that have no induced 4-cycle or diamond are called \\"weakly geodetic\\"; these are the graphs where vertices at distance exactly two from each other have a unique shortest path. Diameter two For graphs of diameter two (that is, graphs in which all vertices are at distance at most two from each other), the geodetic graphs and weakly geodetic graphs coincide. Every geodetic graph of diameter two is of one of three types: *a block graph in which all the maximal cliques are joined at a single shared vertex, including the windmill graphs, *a strongly regular graph with parameter \\\\mu (the number of shared neighbors for each nonadjacent pair of vertices) equal to one, or *a graph with exactly two different vertex degrees. The strongly regular geodetic graphs include the 5-vertex cycle graph, the Petersen graph, and the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. Despite additional research on the properties such a graph must have, it is not known whether there are more of these graphs, or infinitely many of these graphs. Geodetic graphs with diameter two and two different degrees cannot have a triangle composed of vertices of both degrees. They can be constructed from any finite affine plane by adding to the point-line incidence graph of the plane additional edges between the vertices corresponding to each two parallel lines. For the binary affine plane with four points and six two-point lines in three parallel pairs, the result of this construction is the Petersen graph, but for higher-order finite affine planes it produces graphs with two different degrees. Other related constructions of geodetic graphs from finite geometries are also known, but it is not known whether these exhaust all the possible geodetic graphs with diameter two and two different degrees.

It was popular form of writing in medieval poetry. It is a form of constrained writing where each verse begins with consecutive letters of the alphabet, typically starting with the first consonant.The word 'Chautisha' means thirty four, signifying the number of consonants in Odia alphabet. History is one of the earliest form of poetry in Odia language. There have been numerous Chautisas written in mediaval Odia literature. The Prachi Samiti(1925-1934) collected and published four volumes of medieval poetry and it contained hundreds of chautishas.The earliest known chautisa is the Kesaba koili of Markanda Dasa. Markanda Dasa, Baladev Rath, Banamali Das, Dinakrushna Das are some of the most famous poets who wrote Chautisa. Structure Typically the poetry starts with the letter \\"‡¨ï\\" and ends with \\"‡¨ï‡≠ç‡¨∑\\" . Each verse or line of each couplet starts with the same letter. There are some poetic liberties that are taken by the poets . Such as in place of the letter ‡¨ô/‡¨û and words beginning with ‡¨® are used because there are no words that begin with those letters. Some Poets reverse the order of the Letters and wrote starting from \\"‡¨ï‡≠ç‡¨∑\\" and ends with \\"‡¨ï\\" . This is called Olata Chautisa. Typically the Chautisas have 34 couplets/stanzas. However there are some popular . * Chautisa with two couplets - The entire chautisa consists of two couplets with each couplet containing 17 consonants. * Chautisa with three couplets - The entire chautisa consists of three couplets with two couplets containing 12 consonants and one couplet with 10 consonants. * Chautisa with six couplets - The entire chautisa consists of six couplets. one such example is Chitau chautisa by Upendra Bhanja. * Chautisa with nine couplets - The entire chautisa consists of nine couplets. one example of this is Hanumanta Janana Chautisa by Damodara Dasa.

History Harriet Beecher Stowe who co- authored The American Woman's Home with her sister Catherine Beecher believed homemade yeast bread was the only acceptable quality of bread Even before the American Revolution, cast iron ovens allowed women to bake their breads at home, instead of having loaves baked at communal ovens or bakeries. Baking bread remained a primarily domestic activity through the Antebellum era, changing only after the Civil War. As women's role in society was no longer exclusively domestic, concerns mounted that mass produced breads would be inferior in flavor and quality, domestic manuals proliferated imploring women to maintain their roles in the household. Catherine Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe used the language of scripture to ask women readers to \\"stand in the way, ask for the old paths, and return to the good yeast-bread of their sainted grandmothers\\". By the 1920s the manufacture of white bread was automated and pre-sliced loaves became available for the first time, possibly originating from Chillicothe, Missouri. After this, some historical heritage wheat varieties like the Marquis wheat stopped being produced. White bread came to symbolize the forces of modernity and industrialization, but was also at the center of a controversy. Wheat breads were seen to be healthier and moral choice by some; Bernarr Macfadden held the view that white bread threatened the health and superiority of the \\"white race\\". Yeast Yeast was often used when making bread and could be sweet or sour, but bread could also be made without yeast with just a batter of water and flour in a tin pail set in warm water, about the consistency of a pan cake batter (organic flour and non-chlorinated water in this era allowed development of wild yeast). Once the batter had risen more flour would be added until reaching the consistency of a bread dough, then shaped into loaves and set aside in a bread basket. When the dough had dried out enough that it began to crack, it was ready to bake. Another no-yeast bread could be made with a combination of cream of tartar (acid) and sodium bicarbonate. Baking soda could also be used to \\"sweeten\\" sour milk for baking soft sour milk bread. Yeast could be made by boiling flour with sugar and salt. This \\"yeast water\\" solution could be bottled and used when baker's yeast wasn't available. Types =Anadama bread= Anadama bread from New England Anadama bread, a yeast bread made with cornmeal and molasses, originates from the North Shore area of Boston; several towns claim credit for the bread's creation. =Bagels= Bagels become a common street food in New York City's Lower East Side neighborhood in the early 20th century with the arrival of eastern European Jewish immigrants. the International Beigel Bakers' Union is formed in 1907, consisting of 300 bagel bakers. Handmade in small cellar bakeries, the secret of bagels was closely guarded, known only to the sons of union members; no one else was allowed to apprentice or be taught the bagel recipes. =Bialy= Bialys, similar to bagels Bialys are associated with Jewish American cuisine. Like the related bagel, they enter American cuisine in the early 20th century with the arrival of eastern European Jewish immigrants. =Brown bread= Brown bread was made with scalded \\"Indian meal\\" (corn meal) and rye, to which molasses could be added. =Potato bread= Historically, potato bread was made with boiled mashed potatoes and allowed to ferment. Esther Allen Howland recommended water over milk because breads made with milk spoiled faster. According to Howland \\"The greater the proportion of potatoes, the lighter the bread will be; but if the proportion is very large, the bread will be so light as to dry up, if kept several days\\". In popular culture Louisa May Alcott has been noted for employing bread as a symbol of hearth and home, the sphere of domesticity, and Christian charity, themes connected with womanhood in Alcott's work. In her novels Little Women and Eight Cousins the kitchen is a feminist space; Alcott saw baking bread and other traditionally feminine skills as fulfilling and enriching in a cosmopolitan era. By using the example of baking bread, and showing the character's difficulty accomplishing it, Alcott makes the point that domestic skills in cooking are as worthy as those pursuits generally ascribed to men. In Eight Cousins she writes: \\"It was some time before the perfect loaf appeared, for breadmaking is an art not easily learned...so Rose studied yeast first, and through various stages of cake and biscuit came at last to the crowning glory of the 'handsome, wholesome loaf.\\" References Category:History of American cuisine Category:American breads ","title":"Bread in American cuisine"},{"id":"65318989","text":"A Data embassy is a solution traditionally implemented by nation states to ensure a country‚Äôs digital continuity with particular respect to critical databases. It consists of a set of servers that store one country‚Äôs data and are under that country‚Äôs jurisdiction while being located in another country. Purpose Data embassies are regarded as a tool to ensure a government‚Äôs digital continuity, meaning the survival of critical databases to allow the continuation of government even in a situation where governing from within the country‚Äôs borders is no longer an option. Among threats that might lead to such situation are natural disasters, large-scale cyberattacks, and military invasion. In the worst-case scenario, a data embassy could enable government to provide its digital services without the national territory under its control. This makes data embassies particularly attractive to countries that have already digitalized their most crucial databases and are situated in the vicinity of the aforementioned threat vectors. Additionally, data embassies can offer additional computing power for heightened server traffic, for example during election season or the period of electronic tax return filing. History The 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia disrupted websites of Estonian organizations including the Estonian parliament as well as newspapers and banks. Furthermore, Estonia has implemented a stringent paperless policy, meaning that many crucial databases only exist in a digital format. Tasked with ensuring the security and immutability of these databases, the ministries looked towards data embassies as a possible solution for digital continuity. This was crucial not just for Estonia‚Äôs own citizens but also for e-Residents who rely on these services around the world. These efforts were also written down in the Estonian Cyber Security Strategy 2014-2017 which created an outline for ensuring the digital continuity of the state.https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/cyber_security_strategy_2014-2017_public_version.pdf In 2013, then-CIO of the Estonian government Taavi Kotka made active efforts to determine, in which constellation a data embassy would be the most useful and effective. The Estonian government also collaborated with Microsoft on two studies to determine the feasibility of virtual data embassies.https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/implementation_of_the_virtual_data_embassy_solution_summary_report.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2thbY1JUOe4oVrLFoTngeziPhbrTmTnAEe_TdYadhpxhXkXirmZdgKbeAhttps://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/transforming_digital_continuity_- _joint_research_report_finaly_may_20.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3TfoIGtYpo9jMJcTqc64FDQN2Vv1gc- sjWCvSQNapqM7kFjmkUK7COtZQ The government decided against the option of converting selected Estonian embassies into data embassies because embassies did not possess the necessary technical and crisis response competence, were reliant on whatever telecommunications services they would be offered by virtue of their environment, and were not physically constructed according to safety criteria that datacenters could fulfil. On 14 November 2016, the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and Luxembourgish Ministry of Media and Communications signed a Memorandum of Understanding about the hosting of data and information systems. On 20 June 2017, Prime Minister of Estonia J√ºri Ratas and Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel signed the agreement to establish an Estonian data embassy in Luxembourg.https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/2280/3201/8002/Lux_Info_Agreement.pdf This agreement was ratified by the parliaments of Luxembourg and Estonia in 2018. In its first iteration, the Estonian data embassy in Luxembourg currently acts as a backup and source of additional computing power for the following datasets that are considered critical for the functioning of the state: e-file court system, treasury information system, e-land register, taxable persons‚Äô register, business register, population register, state gazette, identity documents register, land cadastral register, and national pension insurance register. In 2018, the Kingdom of Bahrain implemented the so-called Cloud Law which allows data stored in Bahraini datacenters to be subject to the domestic law in a third country. Legal basis Initially, academic research also considered the application of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations or the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure the protection and inviolability of data but found that these conventions would require significant changes. As a result of the lack of international legal precedent, data embassies have thus far only been created on the basis of bilateral agreements that are inspired by the wording used in the Vienna Conventions. These bilateral agreements also usually require ratification from the parliaments of the partnering countries.

He was found guilty of these murders, and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is serving at the Black Dolphin Prison. Biography Little information is available about Orunbayev's early life. It is known that he was born in the Kirghiz SSR in 1962, and emigrated to Russia in 1992. Between this period and 1997, it is known that he committed two murders, for which he served several years in prison. While nothing is known about the first one, including the place and date, the second took place in 1997, in Nizhnyaya Ivolga, for which he served 8 years imprisonment. In 2006, he was released and returned to Buryatia. As he lacked any sort of income, he lived with spontaneous acquiantances in various settlements around the area, surviving by doing odd jobs. After laying low for about a year, in July 2007, he met a young girl on the streets of Ulan-Ude. After casually getting to know each other, the pair caught a taxi to the village of Myasokombinat, where they sat down to drink alcohol on the bank of the Uda River. In his drunken state, he offered to have sex with the girl, but she refused his advances. Angered, Orunbayev strangled her to death and then had sex with the body, leaving it on the riverbank. The next day, he returned to the crime scene, dismembered the remains and then discarded them into the river. They were never located, and the victim's identity remains unknown. In the next years, there are no other recorded murders or crimes which could be attributed to Kegashbek. He worked in the construction and repairs business, earning money mainly by private contracts. After completing one such job in July 2012, he rented a room at the Khutorok Hotel in Ulan-Ude, where he drank alcohol for several hours. On the evening of July 11th, he went out in search for a casual hook-up, coming across a woman whom he invited back to his hotel room to drink. After a while, Orunbayev began to think that the woman had stolen his money. Enraged, he strangled her with a shoelace and hid the body under the bed, going to buy a knife from the nearby market with which he would dismember it. However, about halfway through the return journey, he changed his mind and fled instead. Later on, he found the \\"missing\\" money in his pockets. The woman's body was eventually found by the authorities, who began an investigation to catch her killer. After the last murder, he left Ulan-Ude and settled in the Ivolginsky District, where he worked as a laborer. On September 20th, he decided to visit a 53-year-old woman living in Nyzhnyaya Ivolga, whom he had previously done repairs for. After a short conversation, he offered to have sex with her, but was quickly shot down. Angered, Orunbayev began punching and kicking in the woman's head, beating her to death. After murdering the victim, Kegashbek dragged the body into a nearby abandoned building, where he had sex with her corpse, which he then disemboweled and partially dismembered. When he was finished with his cruel deed, he fed the victim's entrails to a neighbor's dog, leaving the village and returning to Ulan-Ude. By this time, the investigation team had collected enough evidence for an arrest, and sent out a team of officers, who promptly detained Orunbayev four days later on a bridge, when he was about to cross into the Tarbagataysky District. During the investigation, Orunbayev's previous murder convictions were uncovered, and he himself later confessed to the two murders he committed after his release. He admitted that each and every of the murders were done while he was intoxicated, and after being refused sex. He additionally admitted that he had kept some of the victims' disemboweled guts, which he would then consume. He was ordered to take a psychiatric examination, from which the doctors determined that he was sane, but had pronounced psychopathic traits and suffered from sexual sadism disorder, which led to the gruesome nature of his killings. Due to the severity of his crimes, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is serving at the Black Dolphin Prison in Orenburg.

He is most known for his contributions to the modern artificial pancreas. Education Gerold Grodsky matriculated at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, earning his bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1947 and his master's in biochemistry in 1948. He earned his doctorate in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1955. He went on to work as a postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge University, England. Career In 1955, after completing his postdoctoral work at Cambridge, Grodsky joined the biochemistry faculty at the University of California, San Francisco, and became the associate research director of the Metabolic Research Unit under Peter Forsham. Later, Grodsky spent almost thirty years as Professor of Biochemisry and Medicine with the UCSF Diabetes Center at UCSF, researching critical questions about the production, synthesis, and secretion of insulin by the pancreas. In 1960, to further understand the forms of insulin release, Grodsky engineered the first precipitating radioimmunoassay of insulin. In 1963, Grodsky and his laboratory were the first to isolate an animal pancreas to study the secretion of insulin outside the body.Cai, Tao, ed. A Unifying Organ Model of Pancreatic Insulin Secretion. Later in the 1960s, Grodsky's team first observed that the pancreas appears to release insulin in distinct phases.[Falkmer, S. et al. The Structure and Metabolism of the Pancreatic Islets: A Centennial of Paul Langerhans' Discovery, Elsevier, 2013: 538] They went on to publish many studies in support of this theory, which informed the modern scientific understanding of the process of insulin secretion.Grodsky GM. A new phase of insulin secretion. How will it contribute to our understanding of beta-cell function? In 1970, Grodsky's team conducted some of the earliest research on the release of insulin from pancreatic islets]. Research Work Grodsky's study of the perfused pancreas in the 1960s, and then of isolated pancreatic islets in the 1970s, resulted in the discovery that insulin is released from the pancreas in two separate phases, one \\"fast\\" and one \\"slow.\\"Article in 'Endocrinology' This biphasic understanding eventually evolved to accommodate a third, even slower phase of insulin release. These discoveries were significant because they implied that it was not possible to replicate the pancreas's function through insulin injections alone, since injections deliver the insulin all at once. The need was thus identified for a method of pumping insulin into the body in stages. The result was the artificial pancreas, to whose development and refinement Grodsky contributed substantially throughout his career.University Bulletin: A Weekly Bulletin for the Staff of the University of California, Volume 32, University of California (System) Office of Official Publications, University of California, 1983: 134Reichman, Michela (January 28, 1981).

Cation Requirements for Insulin Secretion in the Isolated Perfused Pancreas. Other research Grodsky has researched and published extensively on a number of topics relating to insulin, factors affecting insulin release, and the role of insulin in the development of diabetes. His research topics have included the function of glucose metabolism in the induction of insulin secretion; the effects of reactive oxygen species in diabetes; the dependency of the release of insulin by the pancreas on calcium, Vitamin D, and other micronutrients; the physiology of pancreatic beta cells; and the impact of aspartic acid and glutamic acid on insulin storage, among others. In 2002, Grodsky published, with Joseph L. Evans, et al., a unified hypothesis of type 2 diabetes.Oxidative stress and stress-activated signaling pathways: a unifying hypothesis of type 2 diabetes Professional activities Grodsky has served as visiting professor at Paris Diderot University and at the University of Geneva. From 1980 to 1983 he was research chair of the advisory board to the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services on diabetes. He has published approximately 250c0- articles in scientific journals. He also co-founded the journal Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics and is a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology. Grodsky served on the scientific advisory boards of several organizations including the nonprofit Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. He continues to work at the University of California, San Francisco, where one of his major roles is to advise relating to research on the development and function of the insulin-producing islet beta cell.

Humbert was a neo-malthusian who worked for much of her life to make birth control and abortion legal. Her views about the differences between men and women were seen as controversial by other feminists, but she still fought for women's rights. Personal life and career Humbert was born in 1890. Her mother later divorced her bourgeois husband to marry a militant anarchist and as a result, Humbert was often around anarchists ever since she was a child. In 1909, she met Eugene Humbert, who advocated for Neo- Malthusianism. She later married Eugene, who wanted to make birth control and abortion legal, with Humbert helping him with his work. In 1920, a law was passed which made it illegal to discuss contraception and abortion in France, later leading to the frequent arrests of the Humberts for spreading information. Eugene died in prison in 1944 and Humbert continued his work by writing articles, pamphlets, and books. Two of her books were about her life in prison. She also continued publishing the newspaper La Grande Reforme, which her husband had been the director of from 1931 to 1939. Within two of the articles that she wrote for the newspaper, with the title \\"Our Equals\\", Humbert stated ideas that separated herself from other feminists. Within \\"Our Equals\\", \\"she found equality between the sexes to be illusory because she emphasized differences rather than commonalities between men and women\\". Humbert believed that women are less creative and inventive compared to men. Humbert's term for the differences is \\"integral humanism\\". She later wrote a third part to \\"Our Equals\\" to state that \\"conscious maternity must be a basic right of women; that women had the right to the full expansion of brain, heart, and body; that they must become individuals by practicing altruism rather than egotism\\". Other feminists did not side with Humbert's views, but Humbert's arguments were that she was \\"one of the first women in France\\" that supported women's jury rights and that she supported feminine liberation. Despite her controversial views, Humbert fought for sexual liberation, women‚Äôs rights, and peace.

Designed by architect Aleksandrs Vanags, the construction of the house was started in 1910, and was built in 1912 as apartments and shops. It housed the music school of the Imperial Russian Society of Music, a library and a bookstore, sweets and fruit, dairy products, flower shops, and a pharmacy of the Ministry of National Welfare. During the Latvian War of Independence, the Latvian Revolutionary War Committee used the building briefly in 1919. In 1920, the new government of independent Latvia took over the building for government use, including the Ministry of the Interior and other offices. The Interior Affairs Ministry was using this building in the 1920s and 1930s. In different period of time the building was owned by the Public Affairs Ministry, State Statistical Bureau, and Forestry Department.

Head of the Moscow Conservatory in 1929-1932. Life Boleslaw Przybyszewski was born in Prussian Berlin on 22 February 1892; he was an illegitimate son of the Polish writer Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski. His mother Marfa Ferder committed suicide on 9 June 1896. The boy was taken to his father's parents in Kuyavia, then a part of the Russian Empire. Later they moved to WƒÖgrowiec. Due to his grandmother's influence, young Boleslaw developed a keen interest in music. In 1912 he moved to Warsaw and entered the Chopin University of Music. During World War I he was interned and forcibly moved to Orsk. On 14 October 1918, he married Emilia Nidekker, a daughter of the former city mayor and lieutenant colonel in reserve of the Imperial Army. In August of 1919, when the Cossacks retreated and left the city, Przybyszewski stayed in Orsk and took an active part in public and cultural life. In January 1920 he published an open letter in the local press, where he openly criticized \\"all vulgar and crude attacks\\" on his father. In 1920 Przybyszewski moved to Moscow and joined the CPSU. He started working at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West as an inspector of the specialised secondary music schools. Later he headed the music department of the People's Commissariat for Education. In 1929 Przybyszewski was given the director's post at the Moscow Conservatory. At that time the state policy was to actively 'proletarize' the conservatories, accepting only class-approved students and also striving to restructure the staff and curricula with Marxist standards. The professors reacted to such reforms negatively; they already were in a bitter conflict with the RAMP due to its obvious harm to musical standards with ideology, vulgarism and dilettantism. The capellmeister Konstantin Saradzhev recalled the reforms of 1930-1931 as 'pernicious for the conservatory. The new curriculum cut the hours for most important disciplines and burdened the students with completely unnecessary lessons, such as political-economic studies...'. Saradzhev and several other distinguished professors left the conservatory, however, the core staff stayed. The new director gained a reputation as an odious figure. In 1931 the conservatory was renamed after Feliks Kon, Przybyszewski's superior. The renaming caused particular outrage. The institution immediately received a vulgar nickname 'Horse school', based on wordplay in Russian, where Kon pronounced with the soft last consonant means 'horse'. Memories of Przybyszewski's years as the head of the conservatory were highly controversial. In the memoirs of the composer Vissarion Shebalin, Przybyszewski was described as a 'typical intellectual in a bad way: a weak, unreliable person who strived to look nice in everyone's eyes. The conservatory was alien to him and he did nothing good to it.' Boleslaw Przybyszewski in prison Another professor and a colleague remembered Boleslaw Przybyszewski as a \\"man of the highest morality, who, unfortunately, was succumbed by the RAMP mottos and tried to shape the conservatory's education accordingly\\". On the contrary, the composer Vladimir Shcherbachov mentioned Przybyszewski as a \\"very interesting man, who led a highly intellectual and intense cultural life, a great dreamer, passionate and dedicated to his ideas up to the extremes. He read aloud to me some chapters from his work on Beethoven, which I found very profound. His notes on Bach as a harmonist in the first place, not a polyphonist, were also intriguing and profoundly explained from a sociological point of view. We also talked about my plans and affairs, all conversations with him were very intense and demanding.\\" However, in later publications the director was often described as a despot and a strict censor. By late 1931, the influence of the new political movements in music fading, on 11 February 1932 Przybyszewski was removed from the director's post.Boleslaw Stanislavovich Przybyszewski.

Moscow, 2001 Boleslaw Przybyszewski fell victim to the Soviet repressions. In 1933 he was excluded from the party during Stalin's purges. Then he was accused of homosexuality (a criminal offense in the USSR) and sentenced to three years. He served the sentence at the at the White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal construction site. At the camp, he was appointed to the post of the BelBaltLag's Central Theatre and raised its performance to a high standard. Przybyszewski was released on 7 January 1936, but continued his work at the theatre. His second arrest followed on 1 March 1937. On 21 August, the USSR Supreme Military court sentenced him to be shot on counts of espionage and planning acts of terrorism. The sentence was carried out on the same day. Przybyszewski was posthumously rehabilitated as a victim of the political repressions on 15 September 1956. His wife Emilia Nidekker was also repressed and imprisoned in 1937; she was released in 1945, ill with tuberculosis, and died in 1946. In the memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich, the prosecution of Przybyszewski was mentioned as an example of political terror upon musicians and intellectuals.

It is located between the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Qarawiyyin Mosque. The Kissaria (a term also used in other parts of the Islamic world and sometimes transliterated from Arabic as qaysariyya) is interconnected with the Souq al-Attarine and consists of a close network of lanes and alleys which are filled with hundreds of shops. It is only one part of a larger commercial district and of a network of souqs (markets) across the city, but was traditionally the most prestigious and most central commercial complex. A number of funduqs (merchant inns and warehouses) were also found nearby, such as the Funduq al-Shamma'in. This arrangement of a planned bazaar at heart of the city, near its most important religious and civic monuments, was typical of many major cities in the Islamic world. The bazaar has been established here since the early Idrisid period of the city (9th-10th centuries). However, its streets and houses were rebuilt at least once after the double devastation of a fire in 1324 and a flood in 1325, and then again in the 1920s following another fire, at which point many of the structures were rebuilt in concrete. The most recent renovations, in 2016 and 2017, replaced the street roofs with new wooden roofs, made various repairs and practical improvements, and added tile decoration along the lower walls.

At 17, he wrote his first pop/rock hit, which was released in 27 countries. In collaboration with the producer Dieter Dierks, over 100 of his songs were released by United Artists, CBS, EMI, Decca-Telefunken, Ariola, Phonogram, Hansa and others.During this time he worked with J√ºrgen Drews, , Alexis Korner, Toni Vescoli, Daniela Davoli etc. The conclusion of his rock/pop career made the music for the musical Tell, in which Udo Lindenberg played the leading role.  Contemporary music career  At the age of 26 he turned to the study of classical music. He then composed mainly chamber works, but also two symphonies, an oratorio, concertos, songs and several music stage works with commissions and scholarships from the Swiss Federal Office for Cultural Affairs, Zurich Opera House etc Constant development and the search for the appropriate form corresponding to the content of a new work allow him to develop original ideas; and through his personality, heterogeneous and often even contradictory modernist impulses can be playfully combined into a unity. Construction and vitality, logic and sensual effect are by no means mutually exclusive in his compositions. In the mid-1980s, Fortmann moved with his family to Tuscany, where he founded the Accademia Amiata in addition to his compositional activities with musicians from the provinces of Grosseto and Siena, and directed the \\"Toscana delle Culture\\" festival for several years. In 2016, he founds the international ClaZZ Festival. All works are published by M√ºller & Schade in Bern.

The book was first published on August 25, 2020, through Atria/One Signal Publishers and centers on the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. Synopsis Stelter draws on over 250 sources including 140 current staffers at Fox to detail Trump's ties to Fox News and its evolution from a news network to what he describes as \\"state-supported TV\\". He charts the network's origins from its inception in 1996 under Roger Ailes to today, noting Trump's close relationship with the channel emerging back in 2012 when he was given a regular call-in spot on the show Fox & Friends, giving Trump a platform for the birtherism conspiracy and his eventual presidential run. The book also details Trump's entwinement with Sean Hannity, with claims they speak near daily feeding each other's rhetoric of rigged elections, immigration issues, the evils of the Democrats and the \\"fake news media\\". Stelter also calls out Trump and the network's downplaying of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Fox News medical contributor Marc Siegel telling Hannity on March 6, 2020, that \\"at worst, at worst, worst case scenario, it could be the flu.\\"  References  External links * Category:2020 non- fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Books about journalism Category:Books about Donald Trump Category:Books about the Trump administration Category:Criticism of Donald Trump ","title":"Hoax (book)"},{"id":"65319344","text":"The Left Bank Art Gallery in Greymouth, New Zealand, was the first public art gallery to be established on the West Coast, New Zealand. It is housed in a former bank building on the left bank of the Grey River.  Origin  There had been an Arts Society in Greymouth since the 1940s; its early members included George Chippendale, Arthur Foster, David Graham, Allan Holcroft, and St Clair Sofield; they were joined by Toss Wollaston in 1949. Art exhibitions were held in private rooms, hostels, the Copper Room of the Union Hotel, or on one occasion in an alleyway behind King's Hotel. Even in the 1980s there was no permanent art gallery; Greymouth artist Rod Leonard recalled, \\"We hit a wall of opposition. People said we didn't need one.\\" In 1981 Greymouth mayor Dr Barry Dallas called a meeting to establish a public gallery on the West Coast. Acting chair of the Westland Community Arts Council Roger Ewer worked with Dallas to create an exhibition space on the vacant first floor of the Greymouth Borough Council Chambers on the corner of Puketahi and Tainui streets in central Greymouth. The first exhibition in February 1982, opened by Toss Wollaston, was a \\"vast display\\" of West Coast painting and photography. The West Coast Society of Arts (WCSA) was formed to run the gallery, using volunteers and government-funded Project Employment Programme workers. The gallery held major biennial exhibitions of jade carving in 1984 and 1986, sponsored by Air New Zealand. A donation of $15,000 from BP NZ Ltd allowed it to purchase three works by Olivia Spencer-Bower, the nucleus of its permanent collection. In April 1987 the space in the Borough Council Chambers was taken over by the newly-formed Timberlands, and the Arts Society was homeless. The WCSA staged exhibitions in the Trowbridge Room, and ran the 1988 jade exhibition in the Ashley Motor Inn. In September 1989 a new exhibition space with an \\"uninspiring exterior\\" was created at 29 Lord Street in Greymouth's industrial area. The former National Library service centre was christened Shed 2. Shed 2 exhibitions included a retrospective of Dusty Rhodes' work and Yvonne Rust's paintings. A public meeting attended by 130 created pressure on the Council to establish a permanent gallery.  BNZ building  In 1988 the Bank of New Zealand vacated its 1926 brick and concrete corner building at 1 Tainui Street. It was purchased by local architect Gary Hopkinson in 1990, repainted, and refurbished. The Grey District Council then purchased it for $100,000, including $55,000 from the Lottery Grants Board. The WCSA then refurbished the building and added an entrance ramp. The interior consisted of three exhibition spaces with a 6 metre ceiling, and the upstairs (once the assistant bank manager's flat) was converted into environmentally-controlled storage. The Left Bank Art Gallery was officially opened by Greymouth mayor Ron Hibbs in its new premises on Saturday 23 May 1992, although the gallery had been open to the public since 20 March, and opened its first show ‚Äì a collection of Anne Donovan watercolours ‚Äì on 28 March. The opening had been brought forward in the hope Barry Dallas, the mayor who had supported the WCSA and arranged the purchase of the building, could attend, but he had died a month earlier on 21 April. To mark the opening two large pounamu boulders were installed, one inanga from the Arahura River and one kawakawa from Kaniere: four North Island carvers had worked on one, five South Islanders on the other. They had been purchased by the 1990 Commission and blessed by the Governor General Sir Paul Reeves, and were joined by a flax rope made by Auckland weaver Dante Bonica.  Exhibitions  Interior of main gallery The first official exhibition was a selection of West Coast works by Allan Holcroft, mounted by his son Graham, and a smaller exhibition of works by Evelyn Hewlett in a side gallery. In October 1992 the Left Bank exhibited a collection of painted and sculpted nudes, something that \\"wouldn't have been tolerated on the West Coast 20 years ago\\". The gallery ran as both a civic exhibition space and a selling gallery, to fund its operation. Its first director was Richard Arlidge (1992 ‚Äì July 1994).  Collections  The permanent collection, a mixture of purchases and donations, includes works by Toss Wollaston, Allan Holcroft, Olivia Spencer Bower, St Clair Sofield, Yvonne Rust, Peter Hughson, Russell Beck, 1990 lithographs from Muka Studio, and contemporary pounamu.

The painting is currently housed at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Setting Lithograph of a room in the Brouwershuis, ca. 1849 De Braekeleer used the Brouwershuis in Antwerp as the setting for The Man in the Chair. The painting was exhibited for the first time under the title Room in the Brouwershuis. The Brouwershuis, or Waterhuis in Antwerp is a building dating from 1554, built by order and according to plans by Gilbert van Schoonbeke. The house was located on the Eerste Antwerpse vliet in what was then Nieuwstad.Vincent, Patrick, Zoet water voor de stad: Herentalse Vaart tussen Wommelgem en Antwerpen werd 85 jaar geleden gedempt, Gazet van Antwerpen, 27 juli 2017 Water was pumped up into the structure and from thence distributed to the approximately sixteen surrounding breweries that had largely established themselves on the vliet; this is why the first vliet was called Brouwersvliet.Museum aan de Stroom: Geschiedenis van het Eilandjemolenechos.org: Brouwershuis Waterhuis The entrance to the building is today on Adriaan Brouwerstraat. The building also has a fa√ßade, without access, on the Brouwersvliet, which was filled up in 1930 and converted into a boulevard, which includes the tunnel mouth and the first part of the tunnel shaft of the Waasland tunnel under the Scheldt.Vincent, Patrick, Zoet water voor de stad: Herentalse Vaart tussen Wommelgem en Antwerpen werd 85 jaar geleden gedempt, Gazet van Antwerpen, 27 juli 2017Museum aan de Stroom: Geschiedenis van het Eilandjemolenechos.org: Brouwershuis Waterhuis Henri Leys, uncle and teacher of De Braekeleer, introduced the artist to this place. Both painters incorporated the centuries-old interior into their oeuvre several times. Painting The painting shows an old man sitting in a chair (or on his throne) with his feet on a cushion. He sits beside an open window. Above the man's head there hangs a painting and a statue of Saint Arnolfus. Daylight enters the room through the open window. De Braekeleer worked out the small details very carefully in this oeuvre. This painting appears to be a traditional genre scene: an anonymous character in a banal situation. Yet there is poetry in the work because of the artist's tireless concentration and subtle sensitivity to the various shapes of light and his use of colorite and various elements. De Braekeleer wasn't interested in historicity or historical reconstruction; rather, in this painting he used the Brouwershuis as a peculiar, contemporary antique curiosity. The old man, sitting on his throne, looking straight at us, might represent a tangent memento mori; highlighting the past glory of the Brouwershuis, its collapse, and eventual desertion. The identity of the sitter is unknown. The old man doesn't appear in de Braekeleer's sketches for the painting.

It is home to members of several endangered species, as well as five transmission towers (belonging to the Ravenswood-Ames 115kV transmission line). It is described in a 2020 Santa Clara Valley Water report as an \\"undisturbed tidal salt marsh\\" consisting partly of an \\"estuarine intertidal emergent wetland\\". Its northern tip, located at , is known as Hooks Point. Hooks Island is located directly east of the Palo Alto Baylands Sailing Station. As part of the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve, Hooks Island is a protected area, and local governments prohibit humans from traveling to it; like many parts of the San Francisco Bay area, development (especially of housing) is not permitted. Flora As is common on large areas of ground, grass grows on Hooks Island. Specifically, several species of cord grass provide a habitat for various animals. In 1997, a study discovered that the native cord grass, Spartina foliosa, was being displaced on Hooks Island by the invasive species Spartina alterniflora, which \\"grows denser than the native species and makes it harder for animals to move around\\". The S. alterniflora, originally introduced to the area in 1973 by an Army Corps of Engineers project to control erosion and restore marshes in the Bay, hybridized with native cord grasses, forming dense growth aboveground and a dense root system, which displaced both surface dwellers and animals that lived beneath the mud. When the 1973 attempt to reverse damage to the marshes was eventually found to be harmful for wildlife, it was itself reversed‚Äîthe California Coastal Conservancy's San Francisco Estuary Invasive Spartina Project was able, with the aid of the herbicide imazapyr as well as physical removal methods, to heavily reduce the overall footprint of S. alterniflora growth across a 70,000-acre \\"work area\\", from 805 acres in 2005 to 28 acres in 2016 (at which point $30 million had been spent). While this project was a \\"resounding success\\", federal officials required the conservancy to reverse part of their reversal of the initial reversal, after it was found that the (then-endangered) California clapper rail had taken up residence in thickets of the invasive species. Fauna Numerous birds have been known to live on Hooks Island, such as the near-threatened California clapper rail. In 2011, a Point Reyes Bird Observatory Conservation Science report found that approximately 14 clapper rails had been found in the Baylands, and 19 clapper rails were \\"known to exist\\" at Palo Alto Harbor and Hooks Island. Other estimates of the total Baylands population in 2011 included \\"approximately 15‚Äì29 individuals\\". However, in 2010, there had been as many as 22 clapper rails. In 2013, allegations were made that feral cats were living on Hooks Island and killing them. While it is broadly accepted that there are many cats in the San Francisco Bay area, the extent of their presence in the Palo Alto Baylands (and of their role in the killing of clapper rails) was disputed. While the city's division manager of open space, parks and golf claimed to have \\"personally seen feral cats hunt and catch birds in the Baylands Nature Preserve\\", a volunteer at the Palo Alto Humane Society offered a rejoinder to this claim, stating that \\"compared to people, the damage feral cats do is minor\\".

It was held after the 1830 general election in the constituency was declared void by the House of Commons following an election petition. The grounds for the petition were that the election's winner Sir Robert Ferguson, 2nd Baronet, was also the constituency's returning officer by virtue of his position as mayor of the city. Ferguson and his 1830 opponent Captain John Richard James Hart both stood in the 1831 by-election. The result was similar to that of the preceding year and Ferguson was returned. Less than a month after the by-election, Parliament was dissolved and the 1831 United Kingdom general election was called, in which Ferguson also won.  Background  Sir Robert Ferguson, 2nd Baronet, a Whig politician with conservative leanings, had been elected to the House of Commons for the Londonderry City constituency at the 1830 United Kingdom general election. The 1830 election had been held in the city between 11 and 16 August and the declared result was 258 votes for Ferguson and 87 for his Tory opponent Captain John Richard James Hart. Ferguson was the sitting mayor of Londonderry and hence was also the constituency's returning officer. Three petitions were lodged against the election, on 15, 16 and 22 November 1830 by Hart and local electors. It was alleged that Ferguson had a conflict of interest, ignored a king's bench judgement against him and had ignored complaints about unfair conduct during the election. A committee of the House of Commons declared the election void on 14 March 1831 and issued warrants for a new election. Hart was a noted supporter of the First Reform Bill and Ferguson, to secure votes, also pledged to support the bill. Hart's campaign was damaged by his father's opposition to the bill.  Results  The election was held between 28 March and 2 April 1831 and resulted in 202 votes for Ferguson and 62 for Hart, a similar proportion to the 1830 results. Hart again alleged malpractice during the election and two further petitions were submitted on the basis that Ferguson was still legally mayor and returning officer. There were also complaints from the Catholic majority that the requirement to swear a test, repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, in order to become freemen and electors, deprived them of their vote. The petitions became void upon when the Whig leader, Lord Grey, dissolved parliament on 23 April. Ferguson stood again for the constituency at the 1831 United Kingdom general election, held in Londonderry from 9 to 12 May and was again elected. Ferguson afterwards represented the Londonderry City constituency continuously until his death on 13 March 1860.

The painting is kept in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. Background Cranach, who has been has been credited as the most successful German artist of his time, was court painter to the Electors of Saxony for most of his career, and is known for his portraits of German princes, his collection of nudes, and his portraits of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, whose cause he embraced with enthusiasm. He was a close friend of Martin Luther. Cranach also painted religious subjects, first in the Catholic tradition, and later trying to find new ways of conveying Lutheran religious concerns in art. He continued throughout his career to paint nude subjects drawn from mythology and religion. Cranch's paintings of mythological scenes which nearly always feature at least one slim female figure, naked but for a transparent drape or a large hat, produced early in his career, show Italian influences including that of Jacopo de' Barberi, who was at the court of Saxony for a period up to 1505. They then become rare until after the death of Frederick the Wise. The later nudes are in a distinctive style which abandons Italian influence for a revival of Late Gothic style. Painting A young mother ‚Äî identified as Charity, the personification of benevolence ‚Äî with her naked body covered only by a transparent gauze, breastfeeds a child. She is embraced by another child. A young boy is sitting on the ground in front of her and is touching her leg. She sits on a stone block beneath an apple tree. A mountainous landscape is visible in the background around the bush behind the young mother. Max J. Friedl√§nder and Jakob Rosenberg mentioned six different variations of this work. They date the Antwerp painting to after 1537. Interpretation From 1529 onward, depictions of Charity on her own became part of Cranach‚Äôs work. In these paintings, Cranach isolated (and monumentalized) a subject, which before then had usually been integrated into a series of virtues and vices. Cranach was also an innovator in that his Charity allegories were more or less nude figures, since the transparent veil offered nothing more than a symbolic fig leaf, at the same time helping to increase the visual pleasure. By representing the naked Caritas, or Charity, surrounded by three children, the protestant Cranach suffused his subject and the painting with a quality of motherly love. Cranach, however, was more concerned with physical representation rather than symbolistic aspects of painting. Cranach's nudes, part of his series featuring the same female sitter, are easily recognizable, and he glorified them many times by making them appear in mythological and biblical scenes.

He is known for his work on the role of macrophages in cancer progression and the discovery of Tie2-expressing angiogenic monocytes.  Career  De Palma obtained a master's degree in biology from the University of Turin in 1999 after defending his thesis on the cytostatic effects of type-I interferons on cancer cells. He then obtained a PhD in 2004 in the laboratory of Luigi Naldini, where he studied the effet of bone marrow-derived cells on tumor angiogenesis, and performed post-doctoral work at the Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan, further dissecting the role of macrophages and their potential use as a target for gene therapy in the treatment of cancer. De Palma was appointed group leader at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in 2008. In 2012, he was named tenure-track assistant Professor at EPFL, where he was promoted to associate Professor in 2018.  Research  De Palma heads the Angiogenesis and Tumor Microenvironment group at EPFL. His research focuses on the influence of the tumor microenvironment on cancer progression. De Palma and colleagues use genetic models of cancer as well as genetically-engineered cells to decipher the complex interactions occurring between tumor cells, blood vessels, immune cells and exosomes in the tumor microenvironment. De Palma is known for having discovered a subpopulation of Tie2-positive monocytes endowed with angiogenic capabilities, and which elicit tumor progression. He later showed that inhibition of the Tie2-ligand Angiopoietin 2 induces tumor regression and inhibits metastasis by preventing angiogenesis. He also identified expression of Angiopoietin 2 as an adaptive resistance mechanism upon anti-angiogenic treatment by VEGF inhibitors in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. The laboratory of Michele De Palma explores novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapies. De Palma and colleagues notably showed that dual inhibition of Tie2 and VEGF-A promotes anti-tumor immunity and potentiates treatment by immune checkpoint inhibitors. They also identified microRNAs as potential targets to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages and to promote their anti-tumoral immune functions. De Palma and colleagues also explore the role of extracellular vesicles in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. In 2019, they showed that chemotherapy stimulates the release of tumor-derivered pro-metastatic exosomes. De Palma's group also developed a new generation of cancer vaccine based on dendritic cells engineered with a chimeric receptor called EVIR, designed to internalize tumor-derived exosomes and associated cancer antigens, thus stimulating anti-tumor immunity. Passionate about entomology, De Palma has also published multiple studies on the taxonomy of scarabaeidae, including the description of several new species.  Distinctions  In 2013, De Palma was awarded with the Leenaards Scientific Prize for his research on anti- angiogenic therapies and cancer immunotherapy. He also received the 2017 Robert Wenner Prize awarded by the Swiss Cancer League. De Palma received a starting grant in 2009 and a consolidator grant in 2016 from the European Research Council. De Palma serves on the scientific advisory and editorial board of several peer-reviewed scientific journals, such as Science Translational Medicine, Cell Reports, BBA Reviews on Cancer and Cancer Immunology Research.

Forming  Serbian Right was founded in January 2018 and Mi≈°a Vaciƒá, a former spokesman of the 1389 Movement was elected first president of the party. The congress was attended by 150 delegates. Among the guests at this ceremony were Milenko Jovanov, vice president of the SNS Main Board, Branislav Puhalo, former security chief of Ratko Mladiƒá, as well as singer Marko Bulat.

Controversy  The party has been accused of being a satellite of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). It automatically received access and positive treatment in the pro-government yellow press and television, where only the Progressives and their allies have such a privilege. Vaciƒá gave a speech in ≈†abac which at that time was one of the few cities in Serbia controlled by the opposition and he said that he would \\"push Mayor Zelenoviƒá and his criminals down Cer into the Serbian Drina and strangle him\\", and that he would build a prison in which he would be exposed and spat at. The days before the local elections in Medveƒëa were marked by very debatable pre-election actions of the representatives of the Serbian Right, and the most public attention was attracted by the presence of members of this party in the premises where ballot papers are printed, as well as by publishing recordings of the whole process on social networks.  Electoral performance  Serbian Right participated the 2019 local elections in Medveƒëa and it received 6.5% of the popular vote managing to pass the electoral treshold and enter the local parliament. The party also participated at the 2020 local elections in New Belgrade and only won 1% of the popular vote failing to enter the local parliament.

Life  Haverland trained as an actress in her home-town Berlin with Karl Gustav Berndal and Minona Frieb-Blumauer. She got her first engagement in 1871 at the Stadttheater Leipzig, where she was fixed on the role of the youthful lover. Her engagement in Leipzig ended in 1874; it followed an engagement at the Dresdner Hoftheater. There, she was cast in the heroine parts, played leading roles in modern plays and classical works, and gained general recognition \\"through the nobility of her conception and the noble sculpture of her movements\\".Haverland, Anna.

This was followed by engagements at the Schauspielhaus Berlin (1878-1879), where she made her debut as The Maid of Orleans, and in Frankfurt (1880-1883). In addition, Haverland made numerous guest appearances with the ensemble of the Meiningen Court Theatre, including tours to London and St. Petersburg. Another engagement led her to the Deutsche Theater Berlin in 1883, where she played beside Josef Kainz. Contemporaries praised her performance of Antigone, Iphigenia, Sappho and Medea. In 1892, Haverland made a guest appearance in New York City, where she played the leading role in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler at the Amberg's Theatre. It was the first German performance of the play in America; Ibsen chose himself Haverland as the actress when the play was first performed at the Lessing Theatre in Berlin in February 1891.Vgl.

Haverland was in contact with other artists of her time, including Theodor Fontane. In the Berlin novel Allerlei Gl√ºck, which has remained in fragment form, Fontane placed the character of the theatre-loving Bertha, who is enthusiastic about the role of Iphigenie and chats with her friend Hanke about various plays, on a posthumous journey to Haverland.Walter Keitel: Theodor Fontane: Romane, Erz√§hlungen, Gedichte.

He committed suicide shortly after his extradition to his home country was approved.Reinhard Haller: The criminal soul. How people become murderers. NP Buchverlag, 2002 (New Edition Residenz Verlag, 2012) [in German]  Life  Gerd Wenzinger was born in Sankt Blasien in 1943 (or, according to other sources, 1941 or 1942), the second of three children. From an early age, he had an affinity for music and art, playing the violin, as well as having a keen interest in painting and modelling. After graduating from high school, Wenzinger began studying mathetics and physics, but later switched to medicine. After four years of being together, he and his wife separated, and from the on, he had only temporary relationships with various women. In 1978, Gerd settled as a general practicioner in Stuttgart. In 1990, one of his partners accidentally discovered secretly filmed video footage of Wenzinger torturing his parents during treatment. The tape was sent to the authorities and the medical association, which forced him to forfeit his medical license. Wenzinger ended his practice, and moved to Berlin the following year. His neighbors described him as a nice and polite man, who had many lovers. Two of his would-be murder victims were introduced to the neighbors as friends when they were still alive. Gerd notably often went on vacations to Brazil. At the time of his death, he was imprisoned in the country for a sexual offense. Brazilian media reported that he had tortured around 90 women, mostly prostitutes, killing four of them. In some cases, the deeds were recorded on video. Various lawsuits against Wenzinger, including for rape and sexual abuse of minors, were filed, but the proceedings were dropped in 1993. After he learned that his extradition was approven by the German authorities for the murder of Dana Franzke, Wenzinger hanged himself in his jail cell in 1997. Two days earlier, he had attempted to overdose on antibiotics. He was buried in Salvador on July 21st.  Murders  Between June 25th and 28th, 1994, the remains of 23-year-old Dana Franzke, numbering 42 in total, were found scattered on the northern outskirts of Berlin in the Oder-Havel Canal. At the time, the victim's identity couldn't be established, although the fingerprints of the drug-addicted prostitute were registed in the database. A composite sketch of the woman, presented on Aktenzeichen XY ... ungel√∂st, finally led her mother to positively identifying her in November 1994. Three sedatives and narcotics were found in the body, which are otherwise only used for anesthesia. On November 5, 1994, the frozen body parts of a young woman were found on the Bundesautobahn 1, between Hamburg and L√ºbeck near Bad Oldesloe, among them the head and internal organs. Six days after the discovery, she was identified as 19-year-old Sabrina G., also a prostitute. The investigations into both cases were initially unsuccessful. Two years later, the Franzke case was resumed when a cassette tape was sent to the Berlin Criminal Police in May 1996. The footage depicted tortures, murders, dismemberments and desecration against various women in Wenzinger's Berlin home, among them being Dana. It is believed that she was unable to defend herself from the anesthetic, but was conscious during the whole process. After injuring her multiple times, Gerd tortured her to death using a chainsaw, abusing the corpse before slicing it up in many parts. He made additional cuts in such a way that many of the injuries previously inflicted were no longer distinguishable. Shortly after his first suicide attempt, Wenzinger gave the Brazilian media an interview in which he denied killing Franzke, but admitted to dismembering her body. He claimed that she had died from a heroin overdose, but no trace of the narcotic was found in her body. In his suicide note, Wenzinger denied all of the murders, claiming that he only drugged the women. Several psychiatric books were written about the case of Gerd Wenzinger, which is considered a breakthrough in aggressive sexual fantasies stemming from the perpetrator's childhood.Reinhard Haller, Cornelia Musolff, Jens Hoffmann: Perpetrator profiles in violent crimes: Myth, theory and practice of profiling.

The animal is otherwise depicted as an ordinary buzzard except with a bell affixed to it. The belled buzzard originated from actual accounts of turkey vultures being fastened with cow or sleigh bells. The belief that the belled buzzard was one continuous entity, and not multiple birds, was common, and the creature rose to prominence in the 1880s on through the turn of the twentieth century. Belled buzzard stories circulated principally throughout the southern United States, and it is the origin of the colloquialism \\"not enough sense to bell a buzzard.\\" Early sightings Reports of buzzards with bells appear as early as the 1850s in the states of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. While sightings of the belled buzzard were likely drawn from multiple buzzards, eventually, the determiner \\"the\\" would become standard largely replacing \\"a\\" or plural forms. Prior to the 1880s, the belled buzzard would also be sighted in West Virginia, Delaware, Georgia and South Carolina. However, it would be the belled buzzard's appearance in Brownsville, Tennessee during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 that first connected the animal with a natural disaster. While earlier reports focused on sporadic occurrences, the Brownsville case was the first to become widely cited. It was from then on that the belled buzzard legend grew to take on a more ominous tone. Prominence Following the Brownsville case, sightings of the belled buzzard in the 1880s would rise exponentially. By 1885, the belled buzzard's range would expand to include the states of Maryland, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, and New York. While most reports simply made mention of a sighting, those that elaborated further reinforced the belled buzzard's reputation as a harbinger of doom. Headings such as \\"A Bird of Evil Omen,\\" \\"Disaster Feared with Coming of Belled Buzzard\\" or other comparable titles readily attested to the belled buzzard as a precursor to calamity. The content of the articles were no less explicit on this point. A reference by the Delaware Ledger openly related \\"We most sincerely hope that the bell-buzzard, that has been so frequently spoken of our exchange, will not locate in this section. It might be the forerunner of cholera,\\" whereas a Nebraskan paper simply noted, \\"A BUZZARD with a bell on its neck is frightening people in Maryland. They take it to be the Angel of Death.\\" Claimants Claims regarding either the belling, capture or death of the belled buzzard were not uncommon. Given the varying descriptions of bells, fasteners used and buzzards, themselves, it is sensible to conclude that these reports referenced different belled buzzards. However, neither the presence of other claimants nor continued reports of sightings brought forth an end to such claims. An early report of a buzzard having been belled out of Missouri was made in 1881 despite the lack of belled buzzard sightings reported in that state at the time. Again, an article from May 5, 1900 purported that three Georgia veterans, J. L. Jarrell, H. C. Davis, and G. K. Smith, while stationed in Tallahassee, Florida, belled a buzzard in 1863. The article elaborated that a buzzard captured at Ft. Gains, Georgia was speculated to be the same bird due to the alleged similarities in the bronze bell and leather collar used. Still the dating of the purported belling would have been nearly a decade after the first belled buzzard sightings in the 1850s. If, in fact, the claim was legitimate, the bird captured certainly would not have been the original belled buzzard. Even more elaborate, was an article entitled \\"Aged Buzzard Thought Dead\\" by the Warren Sheaf that not only claimed that the belled buzzard was thought to have died after escaping entanglement from its leather strap, which a sleigh bell had been affixed, but added that the belled buzzard had been belled during the War of 1812 and was \\"present at every big engagement since then.\\" Notwithstanding, the article further purported that the belled buzzard had been sighted as far south as Peru.

Early life  He was born in 1985 in Belgrade. When he was 16, he moved with his parents to Germany. He studied at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law but never graduated. He returned to Serbia in 2004 because according to him he loves his country and that every injustice done to the Serbs really hurts him.  Political career  Upon his return to Serbia, Vacic became active in the ultra-nationalist 1389 Movement, where he first worked as a spokesman, and then in 2008 got expelled from the movement when he formed a new movement SNP 1389. As part of the SNP 1389 movement, he was arrested in September 2008, when, despite the ban on gatherings due to the ban on the Pride Parade, he was among the members of the movement who gathered at the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. The media reported that a gun, ammunition, body armor and phantoms were found in his apartment at the time. SNP 1389 became a participant in the political struggle and tried to reach the institutions by going to the polls. After poor results in the Belgrade elections in 2014, he resigned as the head of the movement. After a 3 year break, he returned to politics in 2017, as a passenger in a frescoe-painted train that left Belgrade for Kosovska Mitrovica, but never got there as the train was not allowed entrance to Kosovo. Vaciƒá was handing out cards which said he was employed by the Office for Kosovo and Metohija as the advisor of the director, Marko ƒêuriƒá. This has caused an outrage in the Serbian public. Speaking for N1, he said that there was a lot of rumors about his employment, but that he did not see what was disputable, considering that the basic human right is the right to work. This interview gained fame for him due to lexical errors and unusual confusion, as well as the negative response of the host to Vaciƒá's request to get a glass of water while the interview lasts. Shortly after this interview, Vaciƒá got fired from the Office for Kosovo and Metohija. Although he strongly opposed the policy pursued by former Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá towards Kosovo, since the Progressives came to power in 2012, Mi≈°a Vaciƒá's criticism has been incomparably quieter for President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and Kosovar President Hashim Thaci's negotiations, the signing of the Brussels Agreement, and Vuƒçiƒá's proposal for the partition of Kosovo. In January 2018, Vaciƒá founded the organization Serbian Right and became its leader. Vaciƒá stated that the party was founded to help Serbia and its institutions both in resolving the issue of Kosovo and Metohija (Kosovo), and in everything that is important for the survival of the Serbs and that the Serbian Right will support the initiative of the President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá to open a dialogue on the status of Kosovo and Metohija and that they expect an invitation for active participation in the dialogue.

He served as mayor of Dunedin from 1919 to 1921. Biography Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 31 May 1870, Begg was the son of Elizabeth Johnston Begg and John Begg. In 1879, the family migrated to New Zealand in 1879, settling in Dunedin. Begg studied at King Edward Technical College and later at the University of Otago, and trained in his father's sheepskin, mat and rug manufacturing firm, John Begg and Company. As a young man, Begg played rugby union for the North East Valley and Union clubs, was captain and president of the Dunedin Cycling Club, and was a lieutenant in the North Dunedin Rifles. He later took up lawn bowls, and was a founding member and president of the North East Valley Bowling Club. In 1902, Begg travelled to Britain and, after travelling for a time, took employment with a rug and mat manufacturing company near London. However, in November 1903, his father was killed in a boating accident at Purakaunui, and Begg was obliged to return to Dunedin to take over the running of the family company. Begg entered public life in 1909, when he was elected as a member of the North East Valley Borough Council. The following year, after the amalgamation of the borough into the neighbouring Dunedin City, he became a city councillor, and remained on the council until being defeated at the 1938 local-body elections. Begg served a two-year term as mayor of Dunedin from 1919 to 1921, during which time he hosted the visit to the city of the Prince of Wales in 1920. Subsequently, Begg chaired the council's water committee for many years, and was closely associated with the development of the Deep Creek water supply scheme. During his tenure as mayor, Begg was unmarried, and his mother acted as mayoress. However, on 14 November 1923, Begg married Jessie Isabel Given in Dunedin. Begg served as a member of the Otago Harbour Board from 1929 until 1947, including three years at chairman. He also served on the Dunedin Fire Board, the Dunedin Drainage and Sewerage Board, and the Otago Hospital Board, and was a justice of the peace. Begg died in Dunedin on 7 January 1950, and was buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery.

Formation  The Regiment was raised on August 4, 1924 at the School of Artillery in Kakul (now in Pakistan) as 1 Survey Section Royal Indian Artillery under Captain E. R. Culverwell. Upon establishment, it consisted of only nine personnel, which included two British officers, as well as several V.C.Os, Indian Officers and Other Ranks. These nine persons, later to be known as the ‚ÄòNine Originals‚Äô, had passed a Royal Engineers survey course at Roorkee. They were selected from Mountain Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry Units to form the nucleus of Survey Section Royal Indian Artillery.  History  Captain Culverwell commanded the section for several years and was followed by Captains H. D. W. Sitwell, C. L. Ferard, K. F. Mackay Lewis, W. J. Gyde and R. MacCaig. 1 Survey Section was reorganised in 1941 as the ‚ÄòSurvey Troop‚Äô and carried out the survey of the Khyber Pass. In January 1942, it was re-designated as 1 Survey Battery under Major J. H. C. Hunter, and shortly afterwards re-joined the School of Artillery at Deolali. In August, 1942, the 1st Battery and a new Regimental Headquarters (R.H.Q.) were combined to form the 1st Indian Survey Regiment. The first Commanding Officer was Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. S. Rendall, with Major J. H. C. Hunter as Second-in -Command and Captain Matthews as Adjutant. Major S. A. Brighty commanded No. 1 Battery. In June, 1943, No. 2 Battery was formed under Major F. A. von Goldstein. A radar troop was raised in 1943 as part of the Regiment. In July 1944, the Regiment moved by road to Ranchi and in August to the Imphal area to join the Burma campaign of World War II. It came under command of 33 Corps, which had begun the pursuit to the Chindwin River line in Burma. No. 2 Survey Battery under Major von Goldstein joined the 11th (East Africa) Division, which was pressing down the Kabaw Valley. The No. 1 Survey Battery under Major B. C. Slater joined the 2 British Division and moved south to take part in the corps artillery concentration covering the crossing of the Irrawaddy River. After the crossings the survey battery joined 20 Division. No. 2 Survey Battery joined 19 Indian Division for the northern crossings of the Irrawaddy. One Military Cross and three Military Medals were awarded to personnel from the regiment. Orders had been issued that units not urgently required were to return to India and on 13 May 1945, the 1st Indian Survey Regiment was flown to Comilla. Lieutenant-Colonel H. G. Croly was now in command and repatriation had begun, and many changes of all ranks were taking place. The regiment eventually moved to Hyderabad (Sind) under Lieutenant-Colonel von Goldstein as commanding officer. On 25 January 1947, as a result of the Partition, the 1st Indian Survey Regiment became 20th Survey Regiment, R.I. A., under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Rajbahadur, having shed 2nd Survey Battery. This became the 2nd Survey Battery, R.P.A. (later 13th Survey Battery, R.P.A.). In 1948, the Regiment took part in the Hyderabad Police Action and Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948. In July 1952, the Regiment was reorganised as the 20 Locating Regiment. In 1962, it took part in the Indo-China war and saw action in Sikkim and NEFA. The Regiment fought in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 in the Western Sector. It was part of the 15th Infantry Division in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, again in the Western Sector. It was part of the force tasked to defend the Amritsar and Dera Baba Nanak sectors. Commenting on the artillery support, Maj Gen Sukhwant Singh (Deputy Director Military Operations, Army Headquarters), writes in his book ‚ÄòIndia's Wars Since Independence: Defence of the western border‚Äô, ‚ÄúThe Independent Artillery Brigade supported the operation with intimate, timely and abundant artillery fire. So effective was the brigade‚Äôs counter-battery programme that there was no interference by the enemy artillery, ‚ÄúThe performance of the Flash Spotting Troop of 20 Locating Regiment in particular, had been commendable. It had started ‚Äúfixing‚Äô the Pakistani gun areas from Day One, when Pakistan attacked Kasowal. Thereafter, whenever and from wherever the enemy artillery opened up, the eyes and instruments of the flash spotters kept updating its latest locations, enabling effective counter bombardment. The four personnel from the regiment were Mentioned in Despatches. In June 1987, the Regiment was redesignated as the 20 Surveillance and Target Acquisition (SATA) Regiment with the role of carrying out all weather surveillance of targets including enemy guns and mortars. The Regiment has also participated in operations Blue Star in Punjab in 1984, Rakshak, Vijay and Operation Parakram (all in J&K;).

She is perhaps better remembered for her role as \\"Clara\\" in the 2013 Puerto Rican film production, \\"The Condemned. Biography Born in San Sebasti√°n, the daughter of a social worker mother, Font enjoyed music since an early age. At age nine, Font began a formal training in music by taking musical classes. Her family later moved to the San Juan area of Santurce, where they were neighbors with Manuel Mendez Ballester, a very well known playwright of the era. Ballester discovered her and he invited her to a radio show he produced at the time, named \\"La Escuela del Aire\\" (\\"School on Air\\"). Font eventually graduated from the University of Puerto Rico with an associate degree, hoping to follow that with a degree in psychology. Before that could happen, she met her future husband, Luis Alberto Font. When the couple married, Font took her husband's last name, a practice that is still very uncommon, as of 2020, in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America. Font moved to the United States but her stay in her new country did not last long. She was pregnant while visiting Puerto Rico. After giving birth, Font decided to stay in her home country and give acting as a career a try. Soon afterwards, she got her first television acting job, when Telemundo Puerto Rico, then better known mostly as \\"Canal 2\\", hired her for a bi-monthly show named \\"Drama Antizime\\" (named, for promotional reasons, after a local mouthwash brand, the show was later named, for promotional reasons also, \\"Drama Malta India\\" after a local, non-alcoholic malt). Font made her telenovela debut in a 1958 drama show named \\"Retorno al Pasado\\". By 1961, Font's services as an actress were so requested that she had a unique contract which allowed her to work for both of Puerto Rico's main television stations, Telemundo Puerto Rico and WAPA-TV, at the same time. While at Telemundo Puerto Rico she acted in \\"Pueblo\\" (a telenovela not to be confused with the local supermarket chain of the same name), she also starred at WAPA-TV's \\"Bendita eres Tu\\" (\\"You are Blessed\\"). Later she starred in other telenovelas such as \\"Justicia\\", \\"El Perdon de los Pecados\\", \\"Maria Merce La Mulata\\" and the major Puerto Rican hit, \\"Entre Monte y Cielo\\". Her theater acting career took off about the same time as \\"Entre Monte y Cielo\\" was on the air. She acted in plays by Myrna Casas and in Rene Marquez's \\"La Carreta\\", among others. During the 1960s, Font acted in the film named \\"El Jibarito\\" about the famous Puerto Rican singer and composer Rafael Hernandez, playing his sister, Victoria Hernandez. Font's career as a television actress and personality continued and she participated in 1969's \\"Juan de Dios\\" (\\"John of God\\") as well as the international hit telenovela, 1972's \\"Tomiko\\" and in \\"Mujeres sin Hombres\\" (\\"Women Without Men\\"). She also participated in some shows that were hosted by Chilean Enrique Maluenda and participated, as show host, alongside Maluenda and her fellow Puerto Rican actor, Luis Daniel Rivera, in a variety show named \\"Super Show Goya\\", which was sponsored by Goya Foods. In 1979, Font acted alongside Johanna Rosaly in \\"Vida\\". In 1988, she participated in \\"Andrea\\", which was another major hit among Puerto Rican telenovelas. She followed that with her acting in 1992's \\"Natalia\\". Meanwhile, she was in two Vicente Castro made-for-TV films, 1999's \\"Coralito Tiene dos Maridos\\" (\\"Coralito has two Husbands\\") and 2003's \\"Promesa de Reyes\\" (\\"Three Wise Men's Promises\\"). During 2013, the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture dedicated it's 49th film festival to Font. That same year, she participated in the Puerto Rican film \\"The Condemned\\", where she acted alongside Axel Anderson, among others.

Saif Sareea 1 Exercise Saif Sareea 1 was the first exercise held between 15 November and 8 December 1986. Nearly 5,000 British military personnel deployed for the exercise. Units that took part from the British Army included elements of 5th Airborne Brigade and 3 Commando Brigade. It also involved ships from the Royal Navy task group, and a detachment of Tornado GR1 and FR3 aircraft and air transport resources from the Royal Air Force. The exercise was the largest deployment to the Middle East in a single operation by the UK since the Suez Crisis in 1956. The joint headquarters for the exercise was at RAFO Masirah airbase, on Masirah Island in Oman. The exercise involved a demonstration parachute drop by 5th Airborne Brigade on a desert airstrip, with air support from the Tornado aircraft, and Omani Hunter aircraft forming the opposing force. Saif Sareea 2 A British soldier with an SA80 assault rifle participating in the exercise. Exercise Saif Sareea 2, was the second and largest Saif Sareea exercise which was held between 15 September and 26 October 2001. It was the largest single deployment of the British Armed Forces since the Gulf War in 1991 and trialed the newly-formed Joint Rapid Reaction Force.Operation Veritas - Armed Forces deployments: The Armed Forces Minister's statement in the Commons Over 22,500 personnel, 6,500 vehicles, 21 naval vessels, 49 fixed-wing aircraft and 44 helicopters were deployed; compared with the previous largest force of around 5,000 personnel. In addition over 11,000 Omani forces took part. =Results= A Challenger 2 tank at speed during the exercise, located to the north of Thumrait. This exercise illustrated a number of problems in the British Army; the traditional \\"make-do\\" attitude to shortages of modern equipment and essential spares fell down in the face of the Omani weather. * Soldiers reported their uniform was too hot and those who had not been issued with desert boots suffered from foot problems as their combat boots melted in the heat.BBC World news, 16 January 2003; Soldiers 'having to buy own kit' * The 66 Challenger 2 tanks suffered from poor reliability. This was not due to any inherent defect with the tank, but rather due to the failure of the Army to adequately 'desertise' the tanks (apparently on grounds of cost). The failure to fit appropriate filters led to substantial engine damage due to the ingress of sand and dust. Two squadrons of tanks were withdrawn from the exercise. * The SA80A1 rifle (the unmodified variant) suffered stoppages and jamming due to sand and dust ingress. * Westland Lynx helicopters became unserviceable as their rotor blades' flying time was reduced from 500 hours to 27 hours. * The Clansman radio system performed so poorly it was judged \\"incapable\\" of operating in combat. Unable to communicate by radio and with no mobile phone service, tank commanders had to pull up during manoeuvres to check orders with each other. * Plastic filters on the AS-90 self-propelled artillery melted in the heat, rendering the gun useless. * Some of the Army's trucks were so old that the only way to keep the engines from overheating was to turn the cabin heaters on full, which meant the drivers had to get out every few minutes because of the heat. Some of these problems - mostly with Challenger 2 and the AS-90 self-propelled gun were fixed in time for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some equipment performed extremely well in the operation. * The recently introduced C-17 provided a level of strategic lift not previously available to the RAF. A report by the National Audit Office stated that \\"given that the joint rapid reaction forces are intended to be able to operate anywhere in the world, it is a concern that the MoD does not hold sufficient stocks of desert combat suits to equip the Forces.\\" Despite these myriad problems, the MoD called the exercise a \\"success\\" and said that \\"the key point of major exercises is that they allow us to identify the challenges our forces might face when actually operating in such testing conditions. We have made comprehensive arrangements for identifying lessons and, where necessary, we will make improvements to our equipment and procedures.\\" =Equipment= Royal Air Force C-130 Hercules participating in the exercise. *Tornado GR4 (strike aircraft) *Harrier GR7 (strike aircraft) *Tornado F3 (fighter) *Chinook (transport helicopter) *Sentry AEW1 (airborne early warning) *Puma HC1 (transport helicopter) *C-130 Hercules (transport aircraft) *VC10 (transport aircraft/aerial refueling tanker) *Nimrod MR2 (anti-submarine warfare) *Falcon 20EW (Operated by F R Aviation in support of RAF assets) Royal Navy * (aircraft carrier) * (landing platform helicopter) * (landing platform dock) * (frigate) * (frigate) * (frigate) * (destroyer) * (destroyer) * (minehunter) * (minehunter) * (minehunter) * (minehunter) * (survey vessel) * (survey vessel) *RFA Fort Victoria (replenishment ship) *RFA Fort Rosalie (replenishment ship) *RFA Sir Tristram (landing ship logistics) *RFA Sir Galahad (landing ship logistics) *RFA Sir Percivale (landing ship logistics) *RFA Sir Bedivere (landing ship logistics) *RFA Oakleaf (replenishment ship) *FA2 Sea Harrier (strike fighter) *Sea King HAS Mk6 (anti-submarine warfare helicopter) *Sea King Mk4 (transport helicopter) *Lynx Mk7 (utility helicopter) *Sea King AEW Mk 2 (airborne early warning) British Army *Challenger 2 (main battle tank) *Lynx AH7 (utility helicopter) *Gazelle AH1 (scout helicopter) Saif Sareea 3 RAF Typhoons conducted sorties from RAFO Thumrait in Oman.

Exercise Saif Sareea 3 was the third exercise held between 5 October and 3 November 2018. It was the UK's largest deployment to Oman since the previous Saif Sareea exercise 17 years before. Over 70,000 personnel from the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces took part, as well as 5,500 from the British Armed Forces. The exercise lasted 10 days and consisted of five phases: Phase 1 involved the deployment from the UK to Oman of 2,000 soldiers and 185 armoured fighting vehicles, which was followed by Phase 2 consisting of national forces training. Phase 3 saw the integration of the UK Battle Group with Omani forces, followed by Phase 4, a final test exercise. The exercise culminated in Phase 5 which involved a firepower demonstration showcasing the combined effects of UK and Omani forces with a beach assault, aided by naval gunfire support, and a display of airborne firepower. The exercise's simulated enemy was Russia. The exercise was the first to be facilitated by the newly-established UK Joint Logistics Support Base in Al Duqm Port & Drydock, Oman. It ran concurrently with the UK's involvement in Exercise Trident Juncture 2018, a NATO exercise in Norway. =Equipment= Royal Air Force * 8 x Typhoon FGR4 (multirole fighter) (No. 2 Squadron RAF) * 3 x Chinook HC6 (transport helicopter) (No. 27 Squadron RAF) * 3 x Puma HC2 (transport helicopter) (No. 230 Squadron RAF) * 2 x Sentry AEW1 (airborne early warning) (No. 8 Squadron RAF) * 2 x Voyager KC3 (aerial refueling tanker) * 1 x Atlas C1 (transport aircraft) * 2 x C-17 Globemaster III (transport aircraft) (No. 99 Squadron RAF) * 1 x BAe 146 (transport aircraft) * Foxhound, Panther and Jackal armoured vehicles (No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment) Royal Navy * (landing platform dock) * (destroyer) * (minehunter) * (minehunter) *RFA Cardigan Bay (L3009) (landing ship dock) *RFA Lyme Bay (L3007) (landing ship dock) *MV Anvil Point (sealift ship) British Army * 18 x Challenger 2 (main battle tank) * 61 x Warrior (armoured fighting vehicle) * 43 x Scimitar (armoured fighting vehicle) * 4 x AS-90 (self-propelled artillery) * 54 x Bulldog (armoured personnel carrier) * 3 x Apache AH1 (attack helicopter) (No. 664 Squadron AAC) * Wildcat AH1 (utility helicopter) (No. 659 Squadron AAC) The smaller scale of Saif Sareea 3 has been blamed on defence cuts, however, whilst the exercise was undeniably smaller than previous exercises, this has been attributed to the greater capability of newer equipment. Saif Sareea 2, for example, involved six landing ships but these were old, smaller and far less capable than the newer Albion and Bay- class landing ships involved in Saif Sareea 3.

Biography  At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, in July 1936, he was secretary of the Madrid CNT. He was part of the juries of the so-called ¬´Popular Courts¬ª, created after the C√°rcel Modelo massacre. Nu√±o would have been in favor of the \\"walk\\" undertaken by the anarchist groups during the first weeks of the war, arguing that \\"expeditious justice strengthened the revolutionary morale of the people and engaged them in the struggle to life or death that we had engaged.‚Äù As Felipe Sandoval would later state, Amor Nu√±o would have had almost total control over the Madrid Checa. In November 1936, he joined the Madrid Defense Council, occupying the Ministry of War Industries. Nu√±o reportedly participated in the November 7 meeting with representatives of the CNT and the JSU that served as preparation for the subsequent Paracuellos massacres. At the beginning of December, he became the CEO of Transportation. At that time, Amor Nu√±o had a romantic relationship with the daughter of a nationalist soldier, whom he had made his personal secretary and even brought to Board meetings ‚Äî which meant she had access to important information. As a result of this relationship, he had seriously neglected his responsibilities. Some members of the CNT suspected that his sentimental partner was in fact a nationalist spy. A meeting of the CNT, the FAI and the FIJL resolved to expel Nu√±o Amor. At that time, he announced his resignation from his position, arguing health reasons. In this sense, Jorge Mart√≠nez Reverte pointed out that Amor Nu√±o left his post due to \\"fear\\". During the rest the war he did not hold any relevant position. On May 4, 1937, he was arrested in Barcelona for his involvement in the events of May. There are several versions of his death. Paul Preston maintains that he was arrested in Alicante at the end of the war, and died in the General Security Directorate in Madrid as a result of the beatings to which he was subjected. Julius Ruiz, on the other hand, maintains that he was tried by Franco's courts and sentenced to death - despite the favorable testimonies of well-known rightists - and was executed in 1940.

Season Yale's season began much like any other, with the exception of their captain sidelined due to an injured ankle. Even with their best defender missing, the team was able to score enough to outlast the St. Nicholas Hockey Club and open with a win. After a mid-week loss to the New Haven Bears, who had swiftly become one of the top amateur clubs in the country, Yale played host to McGill and the backup netminder Ives earned a hard-fought shutout due to Jenkin's illness. The victory over the Canadian team propelled Yale into their winter break and the team headed first to Cleveland. They played fairly even hockey with the local All-Stars and Athletic Club but the team began to hit its stride when it went to Lake Placid. Over a four-day span Yale played four other college teams and won every match. The team didn't score many goals, but the defense and goaltending was superb, limiting their opponents to 2 goals in the 4 games. Yale kept rolling when they returned home, defeating and then tying two more Canadian colleges to run their record to an impressive 8‚Äì2‚Äì1 as they entered their conference schedule. They met Princeton on the 12th of January and the two teams looked to be the match of each other. Yale would go ahead twice, only for the Tigers to even the score both times and end regulation tied 2‚Äì2. The teams agreed to play two 5-minute overtime sessions and just 23 seconds into the first one Thomas Sargent scored to give Yale its third lead of the game. Princeton again tied the score before the frame had ended and after a mad dash for the net, Sargent scored his second overtime goal of the game. Yale held the Tigers back for the final three minutes and the team earned an impressive victory. After losing to the New Haven Bears yet again, the Elis ran roughshod over their opponents for several weeks. Yale dominated both Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Agricultural College, outscoring the two 18‚Äì1. The only goal scored resulted from a bad bounce off of Farnsworth's skate and, in response, Jenkins refused to allow another for four games. The streak included wins over both Dartmouth and Harvard and gave Yale an inside track for the Eastern Collegiate Championship. With everything going their way, Yale was nearly toppled by Cornell. The Bulldogs scored twice in the first and appeared to relax, not taking their opponents seriously, which almost cost them the game. The Reds scored twice in the second but were still behind due to a third score from the Elis. The undermanned Cornell squad didn't use a single substitution in the game but they still skated rings around the Bulldogs. Yale's fourth goal proved too much for Cornell to overcome and the Elis escaped with a win. In their next game Yale had apparently not learned its lesson and the team failed to score a single goal, losing 0‚Äì1 to Princeton after the Tigers scored with just 45 seconds remaining in the second extra session. Yale would have a third game with Princeton to decide the season series, but first they had to face Harvard. The Crimson may have been eager to repay Yale for the 3‚Äì0 loss earlier in the season but the Bulldogs were the stronger squad and send Harvard packing after a 6‚Äì1 victory. The win caped the first series win over their arch rivals in seven years and made this season the first since 1908 that Yale had not been defeated by Harvard (excluding the war year when Harvard did not field a team). In their final game of the season, Yale could capture both the league championship and the Eastern Collegiate title with a win and they played hard defensive match against Princeton. Yale took a lead after one period but the Tigers tied the game less than a minute into the middle frame. With both goaltenders playing tremendously, it looked like the contest may be another overtime classic, however, a hard shot from O'Hearn with just over five minutes remaining put Yale ahead and the team formed a defensive shell around their net, preventing the Tigers from tying the score and Yale earned their first Championship in over fifteen years.

It is believed to have been established by the Knights Hospitaller (also known as the Knights of Malta) sometime after 1187, although it is sometimes linked to the Knights Templar. The present building was constructed between 1498 and 1505, and it is located adjacent to a priory. The property was taken over by the state in 1806 and the church was closed in 1810, but in 1841 it was handed over to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, who reopened the church in 1843.  History  The origins of the church are unclear. Its original name was San Giovanni del Tempio, and due to this some historians believed that it had been established by the Knights Templar and was passed on to the Knights Hospitaller after the Templars were suppressed in 1312. It is now believed that the church was actually established by the Hospitallers after Gerardo, Archbishop of Ravenna issued an edict on 9 November 1187 donating a plot of land in Venice to the Order so as to construct a church and hospital. A priory and hospital named after St Catherine of Alexandria is located adjacent to the church. The church was completely reconstructed between 1498 and 1505 during the tenure of Grand Prior Fra Sebastiano Michiel, and the oldest known depiction of the building is in the 1500 View of Venice by Jacopo de' Barbari. The building also came to be known as San Giovanni dei Furlani among locals after a community of Friulians that lived in its vicinity. The church later became known as San Giovanni di Malta after the Hospitallers established their main base in Malta in 1530 and were commonly referred to as the Knights of Malta. The Hospitaller Grand Priory of Venice was disbanded on 30 April 1806 when Venice was under Napoleonic French control, and the Order's property including the church of San Giovanni were taken over by the state. The priory was rented out to various tenants, and the church was closed in 1810 and had its altars and paintings removed. The church was subsequently converted into a theatre, and it was also used by printers or as storage space. The Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the successor to the Hospitallers, was reestablished in 1839. On 5 January 1841 Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria returned the church to the Order, and it was reopened on 24 June 1843. At this point, sculptures from other suppressed churches were installed within the church. Restoration of the church and priory took place between 2012 and 2014.  Architecture  The church has a long nave with a ceiling constructed out of timber and brick. There are several altars along the side walls, containing 18th century paintings of saints. The church's main altar dates back to the early 16th century, and it was taken from the church of San Geminiano that was demolished in 1807. It was designed by Cristoforo da Legname and it contains statues of saints sculpted by .  Artworks  Several artworks can be found within the church, including Baptism of Christ by the studio of Giovanni Bellini and a copy of Titian's Saint John the Baptist.

Painted in 1892, it depicts a fleet of sailboats off the southern coast of France. Van Rysselberghe's pontillist technique is well expressed in this work, whose wooden liner was painted with dots of contrasting hues serving to amplify the color harmonies in the canvas. The painting was realized by Van Rysselberghe during a two-month sailing excursion in le Midi with his close friends Paul Signac, and it offers visual representation of that sailing journey. It was sold for over 9 million dollars at Christie's in New York in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Painting According to Christie's Deputy Chairman of Impressionist and Modern Art Cyanne Chutkow: > Barques de p√™che‚ÄìM√©diterran√©e is a stunning example of Van Rysselberghe‚Äôs > use of the divisionist technique, offering a scintillating array of dots > that convey a tangible sense of the vastness and serenity of the > Mediterranean as the artist saw it.

It offers a visual representation of Van Rysselberghe‚Äôs > sailing journey with Paul Signac and is an outstanding example of the > artist‚Äôs work in the prime of his career Van Rysselberge painted this oeuvre during a two-month sailing excursion in le Midi with Paul Signac, a close friend of his and fellow divisionist painter. This trip came after a tough year for both artists, who were still mourning the death of Georges Seurat (who died of diphtheria aged 31) the previous year. During the months following the death of Seurat's brother, Van Rysselberge and Signac worked to secure Seurat‚Äôs formidable legacy. They organized two memorials of his work and then set sail less than a week after the March 1892 exhibition in Paris in memory of Seurat. They traveled on the Olympia, the 36-foot cutter of Signac, named after √âdouard Manet‚Äôs painting. The two painters sailed along the French coast, boating past Cette, Marseille, and Toulon before anchoring at Saint-Tropez in early May 1892. Van Rysselberghe remained there with Signac until the end of the month. This time along the French coast was personally transformative for both Van Rysselberghe and Signac, who were still recovering from the untimely death of their friend. It was at this time that this example of Van Rysselberghe‚Äôs mastery of divisionism, the technique that cemented his place among the 19th century‚Äôs greatest Neo-Impressionist painters, was produced. The painting was sold to a unknown customer on July 19, 2020 at an auction in New York City for USD 9 128 000. References Sources * G.

In 1823, the King appointed him as Secretary of State (Prime Minister) and was the first prime minister to chair the newly created Council of Ministers.  Biography  Deeply linked to the ultra-absolutist sectors, he was King Ferdinand VII's trusted person. During the Liberal Triennium (1820‚Äì1823), he was forced by the progressive to push him away but after the fall of the constitutional regimen in 1823, Dami√°n returned to the circles of power. In the last months of the Triennium, in April 1823, the King appointed him as Acting First Secretary of State (acting prime minister), a position that allowed him to command the absolutist reaction to the constitutional government of the Liberal Triennium. He did it with such rigor that more moderate absolutists such as Carlos Mart√≠nez de Irujo, 1st Marquess of Casa Irujo, requested the King to dismiss him in the name of the powers of the Holy Alliance. On the same day as the King's landing in Spain on 1 October 1823, the monarch ratified his confessor as Minister of State. On November 19, King Ferdinand issued a decree addressed to Dami√°n, ratifying Dami√°n as prime minister and creating the Council of Ministers. When the king arrived in Madrid on December 2, he dismissed Dami√°n as prime minister forced by foreign protests in the face of the intensity and extreme harshness with which Dami√°n dedicated himself to persecuting progressive elements. After the death of the King in 1833, he was accused of favoring the king's brother's aspirations to seize the throne from three-year- old Queen Isabella II. His brother and his nephew took refuge with him in Sig√ºenza, where the bishop had to remain hidden on the ground floor of the house of a friend, in which he soon died of an illness acquired on the journey. After the end of the First Carlist War, his nephew returned to Sig√ºenza to give a dignified burial to the mortal remains of his uncle and he buried him in the Tortosa Cathedral.

It was composed of senior executives of the major oil companies who operated an ‚Äòoil pool‚Äô with distribution controlled by the Board. The board was dissolved in June 1948 nearly three years after hostilities ended.  Background  In the inter-war period the strategic planning of the UK's oil supplies in the event of war was the responsibility of the Oil Board. This was established in 1925 as a sub- committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. By the late 1930s the Oil Board's preparatory work for war was focused on potential sources of supply particularly from the Middle East, and Central and South America, together with practical issues of tankage and storage. The Oil Board planned that wartime petroleum was to be operated on the basis of an ‚Äòoil pool‚Äô with production of petroleum from individual companies pooled and then controlled and distributed by a Petroleum Board. Following the establishment of the Petroleum Board the functions of the Oil Board were subsumed in the Petroleum Department (Secretary for Petroleum) of the Board of Trade.War Cabinet paper number W.P.(G)(39)17  Operations  The Petroleum Board was established within a week of the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. It was based in Shell-Mex House on the Strand London. The membership comprised the Chairmen or Chief Executives of most of the petroleum and oil companies operating in the UK. The original corporate membership was the Anglo-American Oil Company Limited, the National Benzole Company Limited, Shell-Mex and BP Limited, and Trinidad Leaseholds Limited and their associated companies. Other oil companies joined the Board later. The aim of the Board was to oversee the import, processing, storage, distribution and delivery of all petroleum products in the UK with the exception of oil for the Royal Navy. Supplies of petroleum and petroleum products were no longer branded and competition between the oil companies was suspended. The Board was acknowledged to have been effective. The success was claimed to be largely due to the Board's Chairman, Sir Andrew Agnew, who had extensive knowledge of the oil industry and commanded respect within it. Sir Andrew was Managing Director of Shell Transport and Trading. In 1940 with most of the east coast and Channel ports closed by enemy bombing there was congestion of shipping at the west coast ports in Bristol Channel, the Mersey and the Clyde. The amount of petroleum being imported was limited to pre-war levels. The Petroleum Board addressed these logistical issues and achieved a doubling of oil import by the summer of 1941. Also during the fuel crisis during the winter of 1940-41 there were few problems with the distribution of petroleum. The Board made arrangements to use oil barges and ‚Äòblock‚Äô trains to transport oil. In 1941 there were reports in the press concerning rationing of petrol that had incorrectly identified the Petroleum Board as being the authority responsible for rationing. This prompted the chairman of the Petroleum Board, Sir Andrew Agnew, to write to the press to assert that the Board was not responsible for rationing. He pointed out that this was the responsibility of the Petroleum Department of Board of Trade, and the Ministry of War Transport.  Post-war coordination  The original agreement, made when the Petroleum Board was established, provided for its dissolution no more than two years after the state of emergency ended. The oil companies also wished to return to individual marketing and claimed that the continuation of pooling was frustrating the development of distribution. In August 1947 the Minister of Fuel and Power announced that the Petroleum Board would be dissolved on 31 December 1947. The war-time pooling arrangements had been retained long after most countries had returned to commercial supplies. In the event the Petroleum Board was dissolved on 30 June 1948. However, the individual companies agreed not to introduce branded products for at least six months. In Parliament the Minister of Fuel and Power acknowledged the ‚Äògovernment‚Äôs appreciation of the great wartime services ... by the Petroleum Board ... and to thank all members and staff ... for the valuable work they have done‚Äô. To continue coordination of petroleum supplies the Minister directed the oil industry to set up two advisory committees to provide liaison between the industry and the government. These were the United Kingdom Petroleum Advisory Committee to provide information to, and cooperate with, government in safeguarding the national interest in petroleum. And the Oil Industry Advisory Council to act with the government on oil matters in general.  Key people  The members of the Board in 1939 were: * Sir Andrew Agnew, C.B.E. (Chairman). * Mr. R. Beaumont. * Sir William Fraser, C.B.E. * Mr. F. Godber. * Mr. F. L. Halford. * Mr. A. Hittinger. * Mr. A. J. Singleton. * Mr. E. E. Soubry. * Mr. F. J. Wolfe. * Secretary‚ÄìMr. H. E. Snow.

Endorsed by the World Health Organisation in 2015, it differs from other classification systems in that it accounts for all women who undergo delivery, and not just those who proceed to cesarean section. The ten mutually-exclusive groups were first described by the obstetrician Michael Robson in 2001, and are defined based on the category of the pregnancy, the woman's previous obstetric record, the course of the labour and delivery, and the gestational age at delivery. #Nulliparous, single cephalic pregnancy, at least 37 weeks' gestation, spontaneous labour #Nulliparous, single cephalic pregnancy, at least 37 weeks' gestation, with either induced labour or a cesarean section prior to the onset of spontaneous labour #Multiparous, no previous caesarean section, single cephalic pregnancy, at least 37 weeks' gestation, spontaneous labour #Multiparous, no previous caesarean secton, single cephalic pregnancy, at least 37 weeks' gestation, with either induced labour or a cesarean section prior to the onset of spontaneous labour #Previous caesarean section, single cephalic pregnancy, at least 37 weeks' gestation #Nulliparous, single breech pregnancy #Multiparous, single breech pregnancy #Multiple pregnancy #Single pregnancy with transverse or oblique lie #Single cephalic pregnancy, 36 weeks' gestation or less The classification is increasingly used to monitor and compare rates of caesarean section in many countries, and some further subdivisions of the ten groups have been proposed.

Under his leadership, a rubber industry was launched in the country. He was the founder, CEO, Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder of Suomen Kumitehdas Oy or the Finnish Rubber Company. His group also designed and introduced a modern timber and cable market in Finland. His interests were eventually known as the Nokia group. Pol√≥n opposed the Russification of Finland during the periods of oppression and was active in leading the resistance organization Kagal. He was a representative of the bourgeois estate in the parliament from 1905‚Äì1906. His involvement in the resistance caused him to be deported to Russia in 1916-1917. Youth Pol√≥n was born in Nastola in 1861 to Ulrik Pol√≥n and Th√©r√®se Str√∂mm. He studied at a Swedish lyceum in Porvoo, becoming friends with his classmate, Werner Soderstorm, a bookseller who introduced him to a model of a money-making business when he established a publishing house. Pol√≥n helped him create a network of agents. Entrepreneurship In 1898, Pol√≥n participated in the founding of the rubber company Suomen Kumitehdas and became the company's deputy manager the following year. He served as CEO from 1900 to 1929 and from 1921 he was Chairman of the Board. It was decided to transfer the plant to the city of Nokia in 1904. Initially, the company faced major financial difficulties. As a result, a number of board members, led by Karl Alfred Paloheimo, wanted to oust Pol√≥n as CEO. Pol√≥n settled the dispute by buying the shares of Paloheimo and his other opponents and in 1915 became the company's majority shareholder. Thanks to the assets he acquired during the First World War, Pol√≥n created a group around Suomen Kumitehdas, which is now called Nokia Corporation. In 1918, Pol√≥n first acquired Nokia Ab, a wood processing and power generation company founded by Fredrik Idestam in the 1860s. In 1922, Suomen Kumitehdas, the rubber company, bought Suomen Kaapelitehdas, the Finnish Cable Works, founded by Arvid Wikstr√∂m in 1912. The 1920s turned out to be a fruitful period of economic success for the Pol√≥n Group. Pol√≥n increased his prestige by making various donations for the benefit of the workers. This, however, did not prevent the company from drifting into serious labor difficulties in the late 1920s. Pol√≥n decided to name the company Nokia, the name of the town where the factories were based, in order to differentiate their products from Russian competitors. Although the three companies mentioned were not formally merged owing to legal difficulties, the commercial success of Pol√≥n's investments created a \\"de facto group\\" or a cluster of three large companies in the early 1920s. The 'holding company' was operated by the Board of Directors of the Rubber Factory and by its CEO, owner and chairman of the board, Pol√≥n. Pol√≥n had to resign as CEO of the Suomen Kumitehdas in November 1929 after suffering from increasing symptoms of paralysis. His successor Torsten Westerlund had long opposed the merging of the companies because he feared that the leftist forces in Finland would insist on nationalization as the group had already become too large. The companies were officially merged with Nokia Ab in 1967. Political resistance and expulsion Members of Kagaal in Tr√§sk√§nda Manor in Espoo on April 10, 1903. Eero Erkko second from the right, PE Svinhufvud behind the door and Eduard Pol√≥n second from the top. Eduard Polon photographed for the Siberian deportation passport in 1916. During the first period of oppression, Pol√≥n participated in the resistance, becoming the leader of Kagal. He was therefore forced to resign as Chancellor of the Prison Administration in 1903. Between the periods of oppression, Pol√≥n represented the city of Helsinki in the bourgeois estate in the last days of the 1904‚Äì1905 and 1905‚Äì1906 estates. He was also a member of the Helsinki City Council from 1906 to 1911. During the second oppression, Pol√≥n was expelled to Russia's governorate of Kostroma in 1916. He was able to return to Finland the following year. Deportation did not discourage Pol√≥n, as he kept track of domestic affairs through correspondences and magazines that were filtered through the war censorship. He managed the Finnish Rubber Factory in Siberia and traded shares on the Helsinki Stock Exchange which led to significant gains during his exile. Finland's best-known banker at the time was Pol√≥n's friend, Wilhelm Bensow, who twice traveled to Siberia to meet his customer. Other activities Pol√≥n accumulated substantial wealth through successful stock investments and was a major shareholder in many companies. He performed charitable work, donating to Marttaliitto, among others. He also served as Marttaliitto's anchor investor. Former president Pehr Evind Svinhufvud wanted to award Pol√≥n the title of Finland's first mountain councilor, but Pol√≥n refused. Family Pol√≥n's was married to the writer Edith Pol√≥n. They had six children, one of whom died young. His wife passed away before him in 1915. Pol√≥n's eldest son, Eino Pol√≥n, went to Germany in January 1916 as a member of the J√§ger movement. It was one of the reasons for his father's expulsion. The younger son, Tauno, was expelled together with Eduard Pol√≥n. Death Pol√≥n passed away in Helsinki 's Kaivopuisto on September 30, 1930.

Plot Dum Dum, an eccentric music hall clown, enters a stage set complete with footlights and a prompter's box. He assembles a mannequin on a bench, and begins to dance. A rival clown in a frock coat enters and attempts to take control of the stage. The annoyed Dum Dum tries various ways of getting his rival off, ranging from angry shouting to spraying him with water. Finally, with a huge mallet, he manages to hammer his rival out of sight.

Painted 1903, it is currently house at the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. Painting The scene is set in a imaginary meeting in Emile Verhaeren's apartment in Saint-Cloud, wherein the poet is reading a passage from his own oeuvre. The audience, from left to right, includes F√©lix Le Dantec, Francis Viel√©-Griffin, F√©lix F√©n√©on, Henri Gh√©on, Andr√© Gide, Maurice Maeterlinck, and Henri-Edmond Cross. The relatively modest furniture of the room emphasizes the intellectual and artistic character of the group, but without boasting their prominence. There is a completely filled bookcase on the bottom left (where the action starts); on the wall there hangs a painting by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, close friend of fellow Belgian painter Alfred Stevens, and even a statue by Auguste Rodin, sitting behind F√©n√©on, the only artist standing upright among the depicted group. Another filled bookcase appears at the other end of the painting, which is closed off by a curtain that partially covers its bookshelves. Verhaeren is depicted on the far left, with his back turned to the viewer, and at first glance he may not seem to be the central object in the painting, nor its most important element. However, he is dressed in bright red (a color wherein he habitually dressed), which contrasts with the dull blue of the other group members' clothes. While all other artists, with similar looks on their faces, listen passively to Vethaeren, the latter is active, reading his poem out loud in his red clothes. The inclination of Verharen's back is dynamic, his hand is expressive and plastic; it reaches to the center of the painting, and as a matter of fact it brings Verharen back to the center of the oil and of our attention. Verharen mouth is not visible, and it is as if his hand were talking for him. The whole dynamism of the painting stems for Verharen, with his peculiar position and hypotenusal, projecting raised hand. The energetic redness of his jacket further increases the dynamic role and position of the poet within the painting. Van Rysselberghe, therefore, expressed his admiration for Verhaeren in many ways in The Lecture of Emile Verhaeren. The poet's hand, moreover, has aristocratic character, with its fingers grouped in groups of two.

These include the corals Cyanthophyllum, Favosites, Halysites, and Heliolites and the gastropod Hormatoma.

Growing up, Mualim Nuri lost his mother at the age of 14, by then he was proficient in the Chimini Dialect spoken in Barawa. Tradition has it, that the senior scholar at that time Sheikh Nurein Sabiri saw him playing with other children by a beach in Barawa, he then invited him to become one of his student. He grew up to become one of his best students and became influenced by the Ahmadiyyah Sufi order. Mu'alim Nuri wrote a poem dedicated to his teacher Sheikh Nurein Sabiri at the time of his death in 1909 called \\"Manaqib Shaykh Nurayn Ahmed Sabir\\".Vianello, A., Kapteijns, L. and K·∫°ssim, M., n.d. 'Stringing Coral Beads' He earned the title Mu'alim which means 'teacher' in the Arabic language, as opposed to Sheikh which was commonly used on scholars in Barawa. This was due to his style of poetry where he wrote in an educative method to enhance people to learn basic religious tasks in the Shafi jurisprudence, by reading his poems.Vianello, A., Kapteijns, L. and K·∫°ssim, M., n.d. 'Stringing Coral Beads' Mualim Nuuri married twice in his life, but had no children, he married Fatima Sheikh Miow and Ay Sitey. He lived with Fatima most of his life in a village called Jamame near the Lower Jubba region of South Somalia. He returned to his hometown in Barawa shortly before his death in August 1959 and was buried in Barawa's south western cemetery Ka- Selemu.Vianello, A., Kapteijns, L. and K·∫°ssim, M., n.d.

A slave involved in such relationship was called contubernalis. The term describes a wide range of situations, from simple sexual slavery to quasi-marriage. For instance, according to Suetonius, Caenis, a slave and secretary of Antonia Minor, was Vespasian's wife \\"in all but name\\", until her death in AD 74. It was also not uncommon for slaves to create family-like unions, allowed but not protected by the law.  In Roman law  In the Roman legal system, a slave did not have a family. If a slave man entered into a contubernium with a free woman, the children were born free \\"iure gentium\\". If instead the man was free but the woman was a slave, the children were born slaves. The law also allowed a slave-owner to free the slave and enter into a concubinage or a regular marriage. A contubernium was allowed also between two slaves that belonged to two different owners. However it was contestable between a free woman and another citizen's male slave. The Senatus consultum Claudianum established in fact that if after three warnings from the slave's owner the free woman did not cease her sexual relationship with their slave she would become a slave to the same owner too. The purpose of this law was not that of regulating the free woman's morality, but that of protecting private property and maximizing the male slave's productivity. If a quasi-marital relationship did not involve slaves but only free citizens it was called concubinage (concubinatus) and benefited of some protection from the law. Among free citizens concubinage seems to have been prevalent in couples in which one member was a freed citizen more often than in couples where both members were freeborn citizens. Among couples where both members were freeborn citizens regular marriage remained the prevalent institution.  Prevalence  It is impossible to know with certainty how many slaves have been at least once in their life involved in a contubernium. According to a sample of 260 recorded contubernia, excluding the cases were both persons were slaves, there was a neat prevalence of relationships where the woman was the free citizen and the man was the slave.

It is noted for its connections to the Ashikaga clan, who ruled Japan during the Muromachi period. The temple is now an archaeological site and has been designated by the national government as a National Historic Site since 2001. History Kabasaki-ji was located in a valley along the Kabasaki River, about 4.5 kilometers northeast of the remains of the Ashikaga residence (Banna-ji). It was constructed by Ashikaga Yoshikane in the early Kamakura period to pray for victory over the Northern Fujiwara during Minamoto no Yoritomo's campaign against the forces of Hiraizumi in 1189. In 1195, Ashikaga Yoshikane became a Buddhist monk at this temple, where he died in 1198. The temple thereafter became his memorial temple and bodaiji for the Ashikaga clan. However, by the Sengoku period, the power and influence of the Ashikaga clan had waned, and the temple fell into near ruin. It was maintained in the Edo period by the Kitsuregawa clan, who claimed descent from the Ashikaga, and a Hachiman shrine was built in its precincts. With the post-Meiji restoration haibutsu kishaku movement, the remnants of the Buddhist temple were destroyed, and only the Shinto shrine remained. Excavations have been carried out continuously since 1984. The foundations of the main buildings are in good condition, and there are remains of a \\"Pure Land\\" style J≈çdo garden with a large pond, and using the borrowed scenery of nearby Mount Yawata. Numerous ceramic shards and fragments of wood with inscriptions have been found. The traces of Ashikaga Yoshikane's mausoleum and the layout of the buildings matches what is described in contemporary documents. The temple area measures approximately 200 meters square. It is located 15 minutes by car from Ashikaga Station on the JR East Ry≈çm≈ç Line.

An indispensable singer on the outdoor stage, Udawaththa has been able to show his talents and sang several popular baila songs such as Ae Neela Warala, Ma Adaraneeya Mage Amma Wethatai, Man Italiye Thani Una, Nelum Wile Nelum Nelana and Ranga Nadeeka.

He won the best actor award at the school level and then everyone called him 'Udawaththa'. He had the opportunity to pass the GCE Ordinary Level Examination and obtain a high pass in music under the guidance of Anura Mahanama. Then he continued to sing baila songs with fellow singers. His first song was his own production composed on the Bandarawela Dowa bus accident. In 1968‚Äì70, Udawaththa made his first cassette tape under the label 'Sisara' produced by Sing Lanka, which included 14 songs. One of the songs, Kaiyi Mihiri Katha composed by Lal Thenabadu and wrote by Saman Chandranath Weerasinghe. Since then, the song is still popular among fans. In 1970, he sang the song Ae Neela Varala Peerala. In 1980, he received a song written by a songwriter named Hector Wijesiri. The song was written as Ma Adaraniya Mage Amma Wethatai. At that time war was raging in Sri Lanka and he thought this was the best time to sing this song. Because at that time there were no such war hero songs. But he did not record the song on the day it was supposed to be recorded. This was because the second and fourth lines did not touch his mind. He changed the two lines and showed it to Hector. Two or three times he read the two lines Udawaththa had written and he rolled up the paper and knocked it to the ground and said ‚ÄòI will never write songs for you again‚Äô came out of the studio.

During the July 83 riots, Udawaththa went for an outdoor musical show. Suddenly a stranger approached him and told that two people on the other side of the stage were looking forward to meeting him. Udawaththa went to see those two men with their faces covered with a black cloth. One of them held a gun to his head and said that he would kill if Udawaththa sang the song Ma Adaraniya Mage. Totally horrified by that incident, that day he sang the song Ae Neela Warala five times to that shock. Finally the guitarist whispered and said he sang it five times. Another day in Bahrain, while Udawaththa was singing that song Ma Adaraniya Mage, a large glass bottle came on stage by former LTTE supporters. In 1993, he became an A-grade baila singer on the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), ranking first out of eighty-eight participants.

Located in Downtown Atlanta, the building was constructed in 1928 and currently houses a members-only coworking space.  History  The building was constructed in 1928 during a boom in construction in the area following the completion of the Spring Street viaduct in 1923. Among the initial tenants in the building were a tire company and two printing companies. In 1944, the Lanier brothers moved two of their businesses into the building, a dictation machine company and Oxford Industries. While initially a manufacturer of military uniforms, the brothers converted Oxford into a general clothing company that, as of 2014, was one of the largest publicly traded companies based in Georgia. In the early 1970s, the building served as offices for the United Services Organization, and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society moved into the building in 1979, though in 2013, they announced they were relocating. In June 2014, Scoutmob cofounder Michael Tavani announced that he would be repurposing the building for use as a business incubator. The building was chosen over sites including Ponce City Market and the Flatiron Building, with Tavani claiming that $2 million would be invested in renovations. Tavani was joined by fellow Scoutmob cofounder Dave Payne the following year. The incubator, a coworking space called Switchyards Downtown Club, was opened in August 2016, in an opening ceremony attended by over 100 entrepreneurs and civic leaders, including Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.

So, after 20 years on the road, the Lindsey family and Wilma move from New York City to 130 Maple Street in Oakdell ‚Äî or Oakdale, according to some sources ‚Äî Connecticut. The move leaves the Lindseys having to juggle the competing demands of show-business life in the city and family life in the suburbs. Mary is the more level-headed and confident of the two, and her dream is to live the complete suburban lifestyle that she has read about in magazines of book clubs, the Garden Club of America, the parent‚Äìteacher association, local government, and working for social causes. Peter, who tends to be vain and paranoid, goes along with the move out of his love for Mary, but makes it reluctantly; he dislikes commuting and misses city life and socializing with their show-business friends in Manhattan. Peter still craves the spotlight and performs occasionally at the Imperial Room in Manhattan as well as for their suburban friends at parties Mary throws each week, but he also makes forays into suburban activities, serving as president of the Keep Oakdell (Oakdale) Beautiful Committee and chairman of the board of the High School Project, which seeks to Ô¨Ånance the building of the town‚Äôs Ô¨Årst high school. Adding to the complexity ‚Äî and often the chaos ‚Äî of the Lindseys' move are visits from Mary's parents, the Gibneys, and the family‚Ä≤s interactions with their neighbors and with Gladys, a sour housekeeper who works next door and is friends with Wilma. Production In real life Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy were a married show-business couple who performed together for over 40 years and were famous at the time Peter Loves Mary premiered in 1960 for their work in radio, movies, and television. Also in real life, they had moved from the New York City to the suburbs with their son and daughter and had juggled the demands of show-business life and those of suburban life ‚Äî for example, broadcasting from their suburban home so that they could stay closer to their children ‚Äî so Peter Loves Mary was semi- autobiographical for them. On television, they previously had starred together in The Peter Lind Hayes Show in 1950‚Äì1951, which had a format similar to that of Peter Loves Mary, although the earlier show had also included musical interludes. Danny Simon created the format for Peter Loves Mary and developed it with Walter Mirisch. Billy Friedburg produced the show, and Buddy Bregman wrote the music for it. Broadcast history Peter Loves Mary premiered on October 12, 1960, and aired on Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. throughout its run. It was canceled after a single season and its last episode aired on May 31, 1961.

In 1984, he was the temporary main presenter of the French football programme T√©l√©foot, during which time he commentated on France's victory at UEFA Euro 1984. Personal life Didier Roustan was born in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa (now Republic of the Congo). His mother is from Martinique, and worked for Agence France-Presse. Roustan grew up in Cannes, France. Career Roustan played youth football for AS Cannes, but was suspended at the age of 17 after an altercation with a trainer. At the age of 18, Roustan joined TF1 for an internship. He was chosen for the role by Georges de Caunes. His internship was for three months, but Roustan stayed at TF1 for 13 and a half years. At the age of 21, he featured on TF1 football programme T√©l√©foot. In 1979, Roustan commentated on a match between France and Sweden, making him the youngest Frenchman to commentate on a France senior team match. Roustan was the temporary presenter of T√©l√©foot in June 1984, before being replaced by Thierry Roland. Roustan is remembered for his commentary at UEFA Euro 1984, which was won by France. In 1989, Roustan joined Canal+, where he worked on the 52-minute programme Mag Max. Roustan left TF1 in 1989 after a disagreement with TF1 shareholder and Olympique de Marseille president Bernard Tapie about TF1's coverage of Marseille matches. After deciding to go travelling for three years, Roustan later joined France 2 in 1993. He worked on a France 2 sports betting programme with Basile Boli, Emmanuel Petit and Louise Ekland. From 2004 to 2006, Roustan worked as a commentator for Foot!, TV5Monde's football programme. He commentated on Ligue 1, UEFA Champions League, and French national football matches. Roustan also worked as a radio commentator for RTL for many years, before leaving the station in 2019. He now works for L'√âquipe. Roustan said that fellow sports journalist Jean Raynal was his inspiration. Roustan is nicknamed Che Guevara, as he is sceptical of the role of money in football. Aside from commentating and presenting, Roustan set up a monthly football magazine called United Colours of Football in 1993. In 1995, he helped to set up International Association of Professional Footballers, the first world union of footballers, working alongside Diego Maradona and Eric Cantona. Roustan suggested to Cantona and Maradona that each of them should contribute $7,000 to support the new union, and the union started with 48 members including Cantona, Maradona, and Gianluca Vialli. In 1997, Roustan organised a International Association of Professional Footballers charity match between Europe and Rest of the World. The match featured Cantona, Maradona, Ren√© Higuita, Gus Poyet, Rub√©n Sosa, and Giovane √âlber. The union ended in 1998, in part due to the recreation of FIFPro. Roustan also created the Foot Citoyen social project, which was supported by Ars√®ne Wenger. Some charity events for Foot Citoyen were attended by Zinedine Zidane.

Life Honor Croome was born on 6 July 1908 in Sevenoaks, Kent. Her father Arthur Hugh Scott was a schoolmaster and her mother Mildred Minturn Scott was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, where she became a close friend of Frances Fincke, later wife of the famed judge Learned Hand. Mildred Minturn's translation of Jean Jaur√®s's Studies in Socialism was published shortly before she married Arthur Scott in 1906. Croome began her schooling at l‚Äô√âcole de l‚Äô√éle-de-France, a French boarding school run on the model of an English public school at which her father taught. She attended a girl‚Äôs school in Switzerland (an experience she used as the basis for her novel, The Mountain and the Molehill), the Hayes Court School in Kent, Bryn Mawr College, the Sorbonne in Paris, and finally the London School of Economics. While at the LSE, she studied under Lionel Robbins and became acquainted with the work of Friedrich Hayek. After graduating from the LSE, Croome wrote her first book, The Approach to Economics and assisted Nicholas Kaldor in the translation of Hayek's Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle into English. She then worked at the New Fabian Research Bureau, an organization involved in statistics and planning ‚Äî probably the inspiration for the Housing Plan organization she later described in her second novel You‚Äôve Gone Astray. Soon after, she married Lewis Croome, who‚Äôd been a year ahead of her at the LSE. In 1933, the couple purchased land in Claygate, Surrey on which they built their home, known as Pearmain. In 1935, Honor Croome became the political secretary to Nancy Astor, then Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton. She wrote in the Bryn Mawr Alumnae Bulletin that the job was ‚Äútremendous fun‚Äù but also tiring: ‚ÄúI am rapidly going grey and can hear imaginary typewriters and telephones in my dreams.‚Äù A year later, she wrote that she left the post ‚Äúowing to (a) nervous exhaustion and (b) incompetence‚Äù and ‚Äúreturned to the fleshpots and to society of son [John Croome] and heir aged 2¬Ω.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery nice, too,‚Äù she added. Croome wrote articles and reviews for The New Statesman and Nation until 1937, when she became a regular contributor to The Spectator. She gave birth to a daughter, Ursula, in 1936 and wrote her classmates at Bryn Mawr that she was busy with a family ‚Äúto cook for, a job to hold down, and a book to see through the press.‚Äù The book she referred to was The Economy of Britain: A History, published in 1938. In July 1940, Croome sailed with son John and daughter Ursula to Canada. She gave birth to her son Gilbert soon after arrival. She and the children spent a year living as refugees in Westwood, Massachusetts outside Boston. In 1941, Lewis Croome was appointed as head of the British Food Mission to Canada and the family settled in Ottawa, where they remained until 1946. While in Ottawa, Honor Croome wrote her first two novels, O Western Wind and You've Gone Astray and gave birth to two more sons, David and Geoffrey. The Croomes returned to England in April 1946 and Honor resumed her work as an economist and journalist while continuing to write and raise her children. She resumed her work as a reviewer and opinion writer for The Spectator, published her third novel, The Faithless Mirror in 1946 and began publishing articles on domestic matters in magazines such as Homes & Garden. She published two more novels in the 1950s: The Mountain and the Molehill (1955) and The Forgotten Place (1957). She also published three economics texts: The Candidate's Companion (1947); The Livelihood of Man (with Gordon King) (1953); and Introduction to Money (1956). Croome did not believe that feminism was incompatible with domesticity. \\"A woman should have a proper appreciation of the extent to which family life was in itself a career,\\" she once wrote. She also argued, however, that men should also take a hand in housekeeping: \\"Just possibly the compulsory Jill-of-all-trades, coming as best she can to terms with the feminist dilemma, may be learning an attitude to life which the masculine half of society could also, mutatis mutandis, adopt with profit.\\" When Croome died in 1960, The Economist made an exception of its practice of being ‚Äúanonymous by conviction as well as by tradition‚Äù and printed a black-boxed notice of her passing. ‚ÄúTo those who knew her,‚Äù the editors wrote, ‚Äúevery piece she wrote could only be hers; to those who did not, her reviews were no less identifiable, running like a strong shining thread through these pages. The style was the woman.‚Äù In The Economics Journal, she was described as \\"an indefatigable writer and reviewer\\" with \\"a firmly established place in the economic thinking of her generation.\\" Work Croome's first book The Approach to Economics was credited to H. M. Scott in its first edition. In his introduction to the book, Sir Josiah Stamp not only applauded its clarity but hinted that it \\"might well be read on the sly by many business men and others in high places, with advantage to the community.\\" Intended as a text for grammar school students, it was reprinted numerous times, becoming, in the words of The Economic Journal, \\"for many generations of students their first elementary introduction to the subject.\\" The Economy of Britain: A History (1938), a collaboration with the historian Richard James Hammond, was designed as an introductory text. Hammond wrote the chapters covering the period through the Victorian age and Croome dealt with modern developments. Reviewing the book for The Spectator, M. M. Postan wrote that it \\"successfully manages to pake the whole of English economic history into one small and attractive volume.\\" Dorothy Marshall called it \\"a stimulating narrative, clearly and even excitingly presented\\" and \\"a very happy example\\" of what the cooperation of economist and economic historian can achieve. Croome's first two novels drew heavily from her own experiences. In O Western Wind (1943), she followed four women and their children from their departure as refugees from Liverpool through the challenges of their first year in the United States. Elizabeth Bowen judged it \\"a brilliantly-told story\\": \\"What she touches, lives. When she writes about ships, I feel seasick....\\" Her only book to be published in the US, it received mixed reviews in American magazines. Writing in the New York Times, Nona Balakian found it \\"unusually well- constructed\\" but \\"photographically conceived, written without grace or much imaginative penetration.\\" You've Gone Astray (1944) follows two friends from the early 1930s into the first year of the war. Kitty is a lively and attractive writer of romantic novels, while Linda is closer to Croome herself, working for a social reform organization while caring for a daughter and keeping a house. Croome captured the hectic strain of such commitments: ‚ÄúShe had to turn dislocating psychological somersaults, morning and evening, Saturday and Monday, switching from the role of expert and organizer to that of suburban housewife and back again.‚Äù Elizabeth Bowen found the book \\"wise and lively: it also contains a message for the innumerable Lindas of this world.\\" Writing in The Sketch, L. P. Hartley was impressed with the novelist's skill in characterization and narrative. The story, he said, had \\"a denouement that satisfies one's aesthetic sense: yet it is not inevitable. We are left with the feeling that so great is Mrs. Croome's cleverness, so sure her touch on the strings, as well as the heart-strings, of the story, that she could have made it end any way she liked.\\" Her third novel, The Faithless Mirror (1946), was set in Canada and told the story of the complicated relationship between a brother and sister. Reviewing the book for The Spectator, Kate O'Brien wrote that \\"Mrs. Croome knows her ground here, and gives life to this story of wartime Ottawa and of her heroine's struggle to find her rightful place in it. The book is living, straightforward and true.\\" Croome's fourth novel, The Mountain and the Molehill (1955), told of the success and failure of a girls' school in Switzerland and its charismatic founder. Reviewer Kenneth Young found it \\"a finely constructed, well written story of a strong and fascinating head mistress, Marie Bossier, whose school finally collapses through the very strength and praise-worthiness of the ideas behind it.\\" In The New Statesman & Nation, Walter Allen was, like Hartley, impressed by Croome's ability: \\"Mrs. Croome handles her plot with great skill, but what most impresses is her sense of fairness to her characters: all are seen in the round and with fidelity and freshness. She is truly compassionate. If only she would write novels more often!\\" And in The Observer, John Davenport wrote, \\"How refreshing it is to read a novel that radiates intelligence.\\" In her last novel, The Forgotten Place (1957), a woman returns to her late mother's country house in search of the source of her unhappy childhood and finds it cut up into a communal system of flats. In The Sphere, Vernon Fane wrote that the story would be \\"thoroughly depressing if ‚Äî and it is an essential 'if' ‚Äî it were not for the creativeness of the author's talent, and the tenderness with which she very obviously regards human beings.\\" Croome wrote three more introductory books on economics in the 1950s. The Candidate's Companion was intended for use by examinees in elementary economics. Professor Bill Miller later said that the book \\"got more people through exams on economics than Mill, Marshall,and Keynes put together.\\" The Livelihood of Man was designed for grammar school readers and those new to economics. Economica's reviewer wrote that \\"there is much to commend the book as a complement to the teaching in the spheres for which it is designed.\\" The Economist's reviewer found that Introduction to Money combined \\"some of the best qualities of both teaching and journalism. She has the teacher's instinct for what must come first in the understanding of a subject; and she combines it with the journalist's ability to spell out the essentials as slowly as need be, yet keeping the argument moving by lively illustration and colloquial phrase.\\" Books =Economics= * The Approach to Economics (1931) * The Economy of Britain: A History (with Richard James Hammond ) (1938; revised as The Economic History of Britain in 1947) * The Candidate's Companion: A Guidebook for Examiners in Elementary Economics (1947) * The Livelihood of Man: Economics in Theory and Practice (with Gordon King) (1953) * Introduction to Money (1956; revised by John M.

History The Sa'bs were of Kurdish tribal origin and during the Ottoman era became a leading family (zu'ama) among the Shia Muslims of the Jabal Amil area of modern southern Lebanon. The likely progenitor of the Sa'b family was Ahmad Abu Sa'b, who is mentioned in an Ottoman tax register from 1571 as the holder of the timar (fief) of Shaqif Arnun (Beaufort Castle) in the Jabal Amil area of Safad Sanjak. The Sa'bs were originally headquartered in the Shaqif Arnun castle. In 1582 he was accused by the government of joining the rebel chief of the Druze Ma'n dynasty of the Chouf, Qurqumaz Ma'n, in raiding the Safad region. The Sa'bs lost the Shaqif Arnun tax farm and castle to the Ma'ns in the 1600s under their prominent chief Fakhr al-Din II. Later in the century, they regained control of Shaqif Arnun and participated in the Shia victory against Fakhr al-Din's nephew Ahmad Ma'n at Nabatieh in 1666. The Sa'b family continued to be mentioned in the local narrative sources throughout the 18th century, mainly as holders of the tax farm of Bilad Bishara (Tibnin-Hunin-Qana triangle), usually in concert with other leading Shia clans, such as the Ali al-Saghirs and Munkars. A certain Sulayman Sa'b is mentioned in a government document as having been expelled from Bilad Bishara. The Sa'bs were crushed alongside the Munkars by the Shihab dynasty of Mount Lebanon in a battle near Nabatieh in 1707. They later allied with the Shihabs and the governor of Sidon Eyalet, As'ad Pasha al-Azm, against the Ali al-Saghirs, defeating the latter at Yaroun in 1732. The Sa'bs and a wider Shia coalition were routed by the Shihabs in the village of Ansar in 1743 after the Sa'bs' failure to remit taxes to Sidon.

It was fought on August 2, 1861, near Clever, Missouri. The battle was fought between several Union companies under the command of Nathaniel Lyon and Missouri State Guardsman supported by Confederate Regulars. The Union forces were lead by Capt. Frederick Steele, the Fourth artillery under Lieutenant Lathrop, and a company of cavalry under Captain Stanley, and finally Totten's battery, with two pieces from Sigel's brigade. The Missouri Forces were lead by Brig. Gen. James S. Rains and the Confederate support was made up of men from the 17th Arkansas Infantry Regiment commanded by Capt. Americus V. Reiff. Future Congressman Jordan E. Cravens, fought with Capt. Reiff's company.  Battle  News reached the Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon on August 1st that the Confederates were advancing on his force, in 3 columns, numbering 12,000 men. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon immediately lead his 5,800 soldiers out of Springfield where they had been encamped. Lyon's force reached Dug Springs August 2nd. Confederate pickets encountered Lyon's advance force made up of four companies. The Southerners quickly retreated before Union artillery could be fired at them and rejoined an advance force lead by Capt. Americus V. Reiff. Capt. Reiff's force of 120 men began to skirmish with Federal forces. Brigadier General Rains was encamped just South of Dug Springs with a 400 man advanced guard. Around 5 P.M. Rains started advancing his troops toward Dug Springs and starting fighting on the opposite side of the road from Reiff. The Federal troops held firm so Reiff sent an aide to Rains to coordinate an assault on the Federals. Reiff advanced his men and the Federals began to retreat but at the same time a portion of Company C, 1st U.S. Cavalry charged Reiff. The cavalry broke through Reiffs command. Reiff later recalled \\"the most gallant act I saw during the war.\\" about the charge. Federal artillery began again causing the Missouri State Guardsman and Confederate Regulars to flee which resulted in a Union victory. The battle served as an important milestone in what culminated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek.

It features the same 10.2-inch Retina display, with the SoC upgraded to the Apple A12 Bionic processor, making it 40% faster than its predecessor. It was released on September 18, 2020. It has support for the first generation Apple Pencil and has a smart keyboard connector. Reception Miles Somerville of 9to5Mac found the tablet to be a good value proposition at its price point. He described it as having a nearly identical appearance to its predecessor iPad (2019), but with improved battery life, enhanced performance owing to the upgrade from the A10 Fusion to the A12 Bionic, and better screen sensitivity for Apple Pencil use, while continuing the poor implementation of Pencil charging on a perpendicular direction from the tablet's Lightning port. He found it sufficient for basic activities, gaming, everyday content consumption, and general multitasking, although not measuring up to contemporaneous version of the iPad Pro or simultaneously released iPad Air (2020), in part due to its display that supports only 60 Hz refresh instead of 120 Hz. He especially faulted Apple's continuing use of a 1.2-megapixel camera on the front of the tablet, which could be a strong negative factor for an intended audience of students, who might plan to use the device for teleconference classes over platforms such as Zoom. Scott Stein of CNET rated the tablet an 8.1 out of 10. Stein commended it for its faster processing that handled iPadOS better than previous models, better support for Apple Pencil and keyboard cases, and a faster charger included in the box. He faulted it for large bezels that lead to a cramped feel of its screen during multitasking with two apps open, lack of support for Apple Pencil 2 and newer Magic Keyboard cases, older 720p camera that does not function well in landscape mode teleconferencing because of poor placement choice, display limited to 60 Hz and lacking TrueTone color temperature auto-adjustment, and the insufficient 32 gigabytes of storage in the entry-level model. David Price of Macworld UK echoed many of the other critiques while noting that this model of iPad would find an audience among average consumers who had not upgraded their previous iPads in years. He described the continuing design as \\"comfortably big enough\\" for typical content, with thoughtful touches, but a dated look because of the large bezels, and welcomed the ongoing inclusion of a headphone jack and rear-facing camera that sits flush with the tablet body. He noted that the lack of screen lamination and consequent flex of the screen during touches could be noticeable to users of higher-end tablets, that the lack of flash on either rear or front camera would hinder low-light teleconferencing and FaceTime Video use, and that the included amount of RAM was low compared to other tablets.

He attracted attention in 2020 when, as an aide to HHS assistant secretary for public affairs Michael Caputo, he participated in efforts by the administration to control COVID-19 messaging from federal scientists and public health agencies.Tom Blackwell, Canadian professor at heart of controversy over White House push to control COVID-19 messaging, National Post (September 16, 2020). Education and background Alexander has an undergraduate degree in epidemiology from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and a master's degree from Oxford University. In 2015 he earned a PhD degree from McMaster University's Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact. Alexander had a contract role as a part-time assistant professor at McMaster, an \\"unpaid position given to scholars working primarily outside the university.\\" The university issued a statement in September 2020 saying that Alexander \\"is not currently teaching\\" at the university. From 2017 until December 2019, Alexander was employed by the Washington, D.C.-based Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), where he specialized in systematic reviews. At IDSA, Alexander worked on several clinical practice guidelines. Advisor to Trump administration HHS official In late March 2020, Alexander was recruited by Michael Caputo, the newly appointed assistant secretary for public affairs at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as his scientific advisor. The two had become friends when Caputo hosted a talk radio show on which Alexander often appeared to talk about scientific subjects. Caputo, who has no scientific background, said in an interview that President Donald Trump had told him to \\"bring expertise\\" to his new position and that \\"the first call I made after I got off the phone with the president\\" was to offer Alexander a job. =Coronavirus pandemic and attempts to interfere with CDC reports= Alexander and Caputo came under scrutiny for their months-long efforts to exert control over the public messaging of scientists and health officials regarding the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, in particular for efforts to influence the public messaging of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) so that it would be more compatible with Trump's public statements. Alexander's efforts were focused on the CDC's widely read Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which Caputo and Alexander regarded as containing \\"political content\\"; Alexander tried unsuccessfully to get all issues of MMWR held up until personally approved by him. Emails written by Alexander and Caputo detailed an attempt to silence career CDC scientists and question their findings as part of what current and former CDC officials called a \\"campaign of bullying and intimidation\\" that stretched for five months.Noah Weiland, Emails Detail Effort to Silence C.D.C. and Question Its Science, New York Times (September 18, 2020). After Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the CDC, who worked at the agency for 32 years, gave an interview to the Journal of the American Medical Association in which she urged the use of face masks to prevent the spread of the virus, Alexander emailed Caputo calling Schuchat \\"duplicitous\\" and claimed, \\"Her aim is to embarrass the president.\\" On June 20, 2020, Alexander sent a message to CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, criticizing a CDC report about risks to pregnant women from COVID-19. Alexander said that the report, whose limitations the CDC had acknowledged, would \\"frighten women\\" and give the impression that \\"the President and his administration can't fix this and it is getting worse\\". He said that in his \\"opinion and sense\\" the CDC was \\"undermining the president by what they put out\\". A congressional committee has asked him to testify in September to give information about his interactions with CDC regarding COVID-19 deaths and infections, hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, and the impact the virus has on children. On August 8, 2020, Alexander wrote to Redfield that \\"CDC to me appears to be writing hit pieces on the administration\\"; he asked Redfield to change reports that had already been published and demanded that he be allowed to review and edit MMWR before publication. In August and early September 2020, Alexander sent several messages to press officers at the National Institutes of Health attempting to direct Dr. Anthony Fauci's media comments. Among his demands were that Fauci should refrain from promoting the wearing of masks by children in school and COVID-19 testing of children. Fauci later said that he had not received the messages and would not have been influenced by them if he had. In a Facebook Live video posted on his personal website on September 14, 2020, Caputo promoted a variety of what the New York Times described as \\"false accusations\\" and \\"bizarre conspirac[y]\\" theories. The Times reported he accused the CDC of harboring a \\"resistance unit\\" determined to undermine Trump; accused the CDC scientists of \\"sedition\\" and \\"rotten science\\"; and called upon Trump supporters to prepare for an insurrection. In the same video, Caputo called Alexander a \\"genius\\" and defended his actions. Two days later, HHS announced that Caputo would take a 60-day medical leave of absence from HHS, and that Alexander would permanently leave the department. At a Senate hearing the same day, Redfield said he was \\"deeply saddened\\" by Caputo's claims, said they are \\"not true\\", and said that \\"The scientific integrity of the MMWR has not been compromised, and will not be compromised on my watch.\\" Two days after Alexander was ousted and Caputo went on leave, the CDC reversed its much-criticized statement saying that asymptomatic people who have been in close contact with a person infected with the coronavirus did not need to receive COVID-19 testing; the statement had been placed on the CDC website by HHS leadership and the White House, over the objections of scientists and without going through the usual CDC scientific review process.Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C. Testing Guidance Was Published Against Scientists' Objections, New York Times (September 18, 2020). McMaster University also distanced itself from Alexander, saying, \\"As a consultant, he is not speaking on behalf of McMaster University or the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact.\\" In an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail after his departure from HHS, Alexander defended his actions, stating that he had wanted the CDC to make their reports \\"more upbeat so that people would feel more confident going out and spending money\\", and that he \\"did not think agencies should contradict any president's policy\\". Alexander also asserted that he was better suited than CDC scientists to assess data, saying: \\"None of those people have my skills. I make the judgment whether this is crap.\\" References External links *Paul Alexander's publications at ResearchGate Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:McMaster University alumni Category:Canadian medical researchers Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services officials Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Paul Elias Alexander"},{"id":"65322873","title":"Rocco Leo Gaglioti"},{"id":"65322876","text":"Linda Datcher Loury (1952-Sept 23, 2011) was a Professor of Economics at Tufts University.

It was announced on September 15, 2020 during the Apple Event. Plans for a services bundle had been in development at Apple for years, as part of the company's efforts to increase its revenue from services and decrease its reliance on hardware sales. The bundle is also a way to tie users of some Apple services into other Apple services that they might not have previously considered subscribing to, such as Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade, which have seen lagging subscriber numbers. The bundling process also ties users further into the Apple ecosystem, deterring them from trying out other separate services that might compete with one of the services included and already paid for as part of Apple One, such as Spotify‚Äîwhich almost immediately called for antitrust regulatory agencies to investigate the bundling.

His younger brother, Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie, replaced him on guitar in Skyhooks.  Life and career  = Early life = Peter George Starkie was born on 21 August 1948, in Sydney to Ronald Keith Starkie (1923‚Äì2018) and Mary Linskill Starkie (nee Taylor, 1923‚Äì2014). He was the eldest of four children, including younger brother Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie. Starkie's father was an RAAF wing commander and World War II veteran. The family periodically moved due to his father's postings, including the Woomera Rocket Range (c. 1955), Melbourne (late 1950s), Canberra (c. 1959), London (1961‚Äì1963) and then returned to Melbourne. While living in London, Starkie took guitar lessons. Upon return to Melbourne, he attended Glen Waverley High School and Melbourne High School before completing a science degree at the University of Melbourne. =Music career= While at Glen Waverley High he started a band, the King Bees, with Dave Flett in the mid-1960s.Australian Rock Database entries: * Joe Camilleri: * Skyhooks: * Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons: They were joined by Joe Camilleri on vocals, who later recalled, \\"[they] spotted me and because they didn't have a singer, they asked me to join ... They played all the stuff on the radio, including the Beatles and the Stones. I joined the band that night... But then Dave and Peter decided to go to university, so I was a bit lost.\\" Note: Authors, Jenkins and Meldrum, acknowledge the chapter is written by Camilleri. The online version is from the Black Sorrows official website. By the early 1970s, Starkie and Flett had formed Lipp and the Double Dekker Brothers, which variously included Avril Bell, Fred Cass, Jane Clifton on vocals, Paul Madigan, Arty Trippie, Ian Wallace and Bruce Woodcock. Camilleri joined the line-up in 1972 and explained: After that group disbanded, Starkie formed Skyhooks in March 1973 on lead guitar, alongside Steve Hill on lead vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Inglis on guitar (ex-the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Greg Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks on drums and backing vocals. Starkie left Skyhooks in August 1973 and was replaced on guitar by his younger brother, Bob. Starkie, Camelieri and Flett formed Roger Rocket and the Millionaires, which became the house band for a strip club, featuring Mary \\"Doody\\" Scott Pilkington. Her manager, and Starkie's former band mate, Madigan organised a tour of mining towns in Western Australia, Camilleri described how \\"we'd be Doody's backing band. We were also her roadies and security. We wore white boiler suits, with our names emblazoned on them ... But the tour fell apart when we hit Port Hedland.\\" They returned to Melbourne where, in 1975, Starkie, on guitar, joined Camilieri in Jo Jo Zep & the Falcons. He later formed the Peter Starkie Trio. After his former band mate, Steve Hill, announced being diagnosed with liver cancer, the original line-up of Skyhooks reformed for a benefit gig in September 2005 at the Annandale Hotel, Sydney. Hill died in late October 2005, aged 52. According to Bob Starkie, \\"[Peter] has played semi-regularly with Paul Madigan (for which he should have received a medal) and has maintained a constant playing relationship with Peter Inglis.\\" =Death= On 13 September 2020, Starkie was renovating his mother-in-law's home in Shepparton when he fell from a ladder and was seriously injured. He was air-lifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital where he was treated \\"but was unable to be saved\\". He died on 14 September 2020, aged 72, and was survived by his partner, Diana, his daughters and his siblings.

As a two- year-old in 2020 he made a successful debut in a maiden race and then won the Group 1 National Stakes. Background Thunder Moon is a bay colt with a white star and snip bred in Ireland by Whisperview Trading a breeding company owned by Aidan O'Brien and his wife Anne Marie. He initially raced in the colours of Anne Marie O'Brien and was sent into training with her son Joseph Patrick O'Brien at Owning Hill, County Kilkenny. He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Zoffany, who won the Phoenix Stakes as a two-year-old but produced his best effort when running a close second to Frankel in the St James's Palace Stakes. His other foals have included Albigna, Ventura Storm (Gran Premio del Jockey Club), Washington DC (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Fleeting (May Hill Stakes). Thunder Moon's dam Small Sacrifice never appeared on a racecourse but was a granddaughter of the successful racehorse and broodmare Trusted Partner, whose other descendants have included Search For A Song and Free Eagle. Racing career =2020: two-year-old season= Thunder Moon began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 9 August when he was ridden by Declan McDonogh and started at odds of 10/1 in an eleven-runner field. After starting well and settling just behind the leaders he took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by almost four lengths. After the race the colt entered the ownership of Chantal Regalado-Rodriguez. On 13 September Thunder Moon was moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 National Stakes at the Curragh in which he was again partnered by McDonogh. He went off the 15/2 third choice in the betting behind Lucky Vega and Master of the Seas (winner of the Superlative Stakes) in a ten-runner field which also included Military Style (Tyros Stakes), Law of Indices (Railway Stakes) and Mac Swiney (Futurity Stakes). After tracking the leaders on the inside Thunder Moon struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but when he found room to race he accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and won in \\"impressive\\" fashion by one and a half lengths and a short head from Wembley and St Mark's Basilica. Declan McDonogh commented \\"He quickened very well. I just got on heels when I was trying to angle out a little bit and had to bite the bullet and sit and suffer, but he showed great heart when he got a bit of room and always gave me the feel that he was going to run them down. He's got a serious will to win.\\" After the race he was made favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas. On 10 October Thunder Moon was sent to England and started the 11/4 favourite for the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. After racing in mid-division he made steady progress in the closing stages but was beaten into third place behind St Mark's Basilica and Wembley, finishing two and a half lengths behind the winner.

It marks the first official release of Hendrix's two full sets during the filming for the 1971 film Rainbow Bridge. The two-CD and three-LP set is to be released on November 20, 2020, along with a video documentary titled Music, Money, Madness... Jimi Hendrix in Maui. Background Although listed as a Jimi Hendrix Experience release, Hendrix is accompanied by his post-Band of Gypsys group with Mitch Mitchell on drums and Billy Cox on bass. It was the trio's second-to-last performance in the U.S. during their final The Cry of Love Tour in 1970. They played a mix of songs Hendrix was preparing for a fourth studio album, as well as material from his days with Experience, playing at Woodstock, and with the Band of Gypsys. Despite claiming to be a soundtrack, the 1971 album Rainbow Bridge did not include any of Hendrix's Maui performances. Several heavily-edited songs totaling 17-minutes were first released with the Rainbow Bridge film. Additional songs were released on The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set (2000) (a medley of \\"Hey Baby\\" / \\"In from the Storm\\") and Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001) (\\"Foxey Lady\\"). The trio performed two fifty-minute sets; however, there were technical problems partly due to the high winds in the unprotected former pasture. As a result, Mitchell re-recorded his drum parts at Electric Lady Studio in New York City in 1971, but Hendrix had no further input. Track listing Sets lists show a different running order and, over the years, Hendrix biographers have used alternate names for some of the songs and medleys. For example, \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" has been identified as \\"Getting My Heart Back Together\\"; \\"Villanova Junction\\" as \\"Instrumental Solo\\"; and the medley portions of \\"Midnight Lightning\\", \\"Hey Baby\\" (second set), \\"Drum Solo\\", and \\"Hey Joe\\" have not been listed separately.

Life and education  He was born April 11, 1858 in Logansport, Indiana the son of Humphrey Marshall and Margaret Marshall (nee Rice). The family then moved to Kansas in 1870, the state John would spend the rest of his life in. He started his education in the Independence school district, while living in Grenola the place where his mother died while he was young and her grave is located. His father then moved back to Indiana but John stayed and lived with neighbors. He acquired much of his education being self-taught, before going on to spend two years at Kansas State University where he graduated with high honors even though he suffered a severe measles attack during his education. He qualified as a teacher holding a first grade teacher's certificate. After University he returned to Elk county and married Miss Addie Jenks of Mound Branch in 1882. He served as a member of the school board of Howard, Kansas for several years. He was profoundly religious and it was said that he feared God and no one else. Starting December 1915 he gave a series of addresses to the Second Presbyterian Church, in North Topeka, starting with \\"Am I a Jonah?\\"  Career  In 1882 he was admitted to the bar in Elk County, with his first official position as mayor of Howard the city where he lived. He was then the Howard city attorney for several years, and then the Elk County Attorney from 1895 until 1899. He later went on to become the Winfield city attorney and later an attorney for the Kansas State Temperance Union. He also worked as the state assistant attorney general under Fred S. Jackson, and as attorney for the railroad commission and public utilities commission from 1911 to 1913. He was a Republican throughout his career. He was known for being an outstanding figure in the enforcement of the Kansas prohibition laws. Three decades before his death he had been a attorney for the Anti-Saloon League and the creator of the \\"padlock plan\\" for controlling blind pigs. He also represented the Temperance Society of the Methodist Church in Colorado, and was part of the development of prohibition in Kansas. In January 1914 he announced that he would run for the Kansas Supreme Court with a desire to move from being John Marshall of Elk county to John Marshall of Kansas, he was living in Topeka at the time. Although popular with many in September 1914 Mrs Myra McHenry made it \\"Her Hobby Now\\" to go after Marshall's \\"political scalp\\" not believing he was fit for the position. Mrs McHenry had known him for thirty years and circulated pamphlets criticizing him. She claimed that while he was the prosecuting attorney for Cowley County, Kansas prisoners lounged in a carpeted lobby in the jail. She also claimed she was held under guard at her home charged with insanity, then escaped and on securing legal help the charges were dropped. He was elected to the court along with John Shaw Dawson to replace Alfred Washburn Benson and Clark Allen Smith, with Henry Freeman Mason retaining his seat. He also lectured at the Washburn Law School from around 1915 teaching Real Property. Marshall died while serving his 17th year on the supreme court and Edward Ray Sloan was appointed to complete his unexpired term by Governor Harry Hines Woodring.  Death  He died March 25, 1931 at his home in Topeka, Kansas aged 72, he had been suffering a prolonged illness. He had had a severe cold that has prevented him from his service to the court for several weeks, returning for the January inaugural ceremonies. Later that month he was again confined to his home with heart issues. On the night of his death after sitting in a chair for an hour he complained of feeling tired and returned to bed, dying not long after. He was survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

Members of the family have held the hereditary title of Whitaker Baronets.  Notable members  Joseph Whitaker can be traced back in Palermo, Italy, to 1820s when Benjamin Ingham(!784-1861) invited his Whitaker nephews to go into business with him. Joseph Whitaker Joseph Isaac Spadafora Whitaker(1850-1936)was the son of Joseph Whitaker (1802-1884) - he was an archeologist, ornithologist, and a sportsman. He is famous of his birds of Tunisia work, in addition to being among the pioneers of US Citt√† di Palermo, a Sicilian football club. Upon inheriting the Ingham Marsala wine business, Whitaker went on to inherit huge vineyards in addition to the Ingham's banking empire owned by his grandfather. Joseph Whitaker built Villa Malfitano in Palermo, an Italian mansion close proximity to Zisa Castle on the Via Dante. His wife Tina, was General Scalia Alfonso‚Äôs daughter who had traveled to Palermo few years before Risorgimento. One of their two daughters got married to General Antonio Giogio who was a War minister in Italy and is remembered for fighting the First and Second Wars in Abyssinia. This means the family was deeply rooted in the upper ranks of Italian culture.  Fortune  Joseph Whitaker has been associated with a significant number of properties in Italy. The family is highly known for a fortune made in Sicily courtesy of producing and exporting Marsala wine. Benjamin Ingham is considered the main source of the Whitaker family wealth and had sailed and arrived in Sicily in 1809, where he focused on manufacturing and exporting wool and wine. Considering that he had no children of his own, there was some speculation as to whom he would leave his fortune -it was not left to his eldest nephew, but to William and Joseph Whitaker.. The other great fortune owned by the family was the Villa Malfitano. Joseph and his wife were residents of Palermo where they erected Villa Malfitano, Art Nouveau designed. Despite being a 19th century structure, Villa Malfitano currently preserves undamaged its priceless furnishings and valuable collections. The Agave cultivation was another key initiative that generated great fortunes for Whitaker family in Italy. Joseph Whitaker introduced farming of unyielding Agave var. The plant is believed to have originated in Mexico and thus requires warm climate for maximum yield. This enabled the family to partner with various textile industries. By the time Joseph died, he had accumulated wealth valued at approximately ¬£12,000,000, and this would presently translate to ¬£1 billion or perhaps higher. William Ingham Whitaker‚Äôs was married to Hon. Hilda Guilhermina Dundas, who was the daughter to Charles Saunders Melville Dundas, 6th Viscount of Melville. William and Hilda had two children and left his fortune and estate Pylewell Park to his eldest daughter Lady Elspeth Grace Whitaker, 6th Marquise of Northampton. Which was later left to her son John Christopher Henry Ingham Roper-Curzon, 20th Baron of Teynham.  Lifestyle  Joseph Whitaker himself who was an archeologist, ornithologist and a sportsman. On sportsmanship, Joseph Whitaker is remembered for having pioneered the US Citt√† di Palermo, a Sicilian football club. Edward VII was equally associated with the Whitaker family. He was King of Britain‚Äôs UK and Ireland, in addition to being the Emperor of India. The family members were equally aristocrats, signifying their difference from other people in Palermo. During the Belle √âpoque years, the home of Joseph Whitaker became the place for where all lavish parties were hosted and graced by Italian and British royalties as an approach celebrating the European community. The key noble and royal friends included Benito Mussolini, Richard Wagner, Edward VII, Queen Mary and Empress Eugenie. These were mostly friends of Tina Whitaker.  Philanthropy  Whitaker was personally the initiator and president of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals‚Äô society based in Palermo, besides being a key figure in the institutionalization of US Citt√† di Palermo, during the late 1880s, thus being remembered as the Club‚Äôs first president. In the year 1871, both Benjamin Ingham and Joseph Whitaker were close to God and declared their plan of building, jointly, a place of worship which reflected the type of worship that was being done in the Church of England for the purposes of serving the spiritual purposes for their fellow countrymen of protestant denomination residing or touring Palermo. Both Benjamin Ingham's and Whitaker‚Äôs families met all the church construction expenses. Following Joseph Whitaker's death, Joshua Whitaker, his son, inherited the patronage and interest of the church. Upon Joshua Whitaker‚Äôs death, the mantle of leadership was given to his brother, eventually the patronage and interest of the church was passed to the Gibraltar Diocesan Trust. Also donating the mansion Villa Malfitano, to be the headquarters of Whitaker Foundation.  References  *Lo Valvo, F. and Massa B.

Production The design was built by Hake Yachts of Stuart, Florida starting in 1984, with 600 boats completed before production ended. The company later re-located to Largo, Florida, United States and was renamed the Starboard Yacht Company, when they bought out Island Packet Yachts. Design The Seaward 25 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars. The hull has plumb stem and a plumb transom, with a transom-hung rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard shoal draft keel fitted or with the deep \\"bluewater\\" keel. The boat may be optionally fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel inboard engine or a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double \\"V\\"-berth in the bow cabin, a straight settee in the main cabin and an aft berth on the port side. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is angled and is equipped with a two-burner stove and a sink. The head is located on the starboard side. Operational history Darrell Nicholson, the editor of Practical Sailor, did a review of the boat in 2003. He described sailing it, writing, \\"we sailed in 8-10 knots of wind, flying a 135-percent genoa, the maximum recommended by the designer, and full mainsail. The helm was responsive, and the boat quickly accelerated with the occasional puff of breeze. In a steady breeze we sailed at 4-5 knots on a reach. Hardening up and pushing to within 45 degrees of the wind, speed dropped by about a knot. We couldn‚Äôt record precise speeds because of a dirty speedo impeller. In fact, it was hard to get an accurate feel for her performance altogether, because the river current flows into the prevailing winds. However, sailing cross-current on a beam reach, she showed good speed, helm balance, and tracking. We‚Äôd like to take a longer sail to weather in open water. She did provide a comfortable ride, especially when compared to water- ballasted trailerables, and was easy to sail with little muscular effort.\\" In a 2000 review in Sailing Magazine, writer John Kretschmer, wrote, \\"we hauled up the main and optional 135-percent genoa and, with a joy that only small boats provide, sailed away from the dock. While the Seaward 25 offers the ease of handling and overall lack of fuss associated with most small boats, it also has several features usually reserved for larger boats. From wheel steering to diesel power to hot and cold pressure water to the surprisingly comfortable interior, the Seaward has the feel of a larger boat. I could happily spend a few weeks aboard a Seaward 25 exploring a bit of thin turquoise water in the Bahamas.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Seaward 22 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Seaward 25"},{"id":"65323491","text":"Andy J. Spahn (born July 27, 1953Birth day and month have been published several times by Politico. Birth year is derived from the Wall Street Journal piece of August 2007 saying \\"private political aides like the 54-year-old Mr. Spahn.\\" *) is an American political activist, consultant and Democratic Party fundraiser. He is the political advisor to DreamWorks founders Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. From his beginnings as a radical anti-war and anti-apartheid activist in California, Spahn advanced in the 1980s to direct Tom Hayden's Campaign for Economic Democracy. In the 1990s, Spahn was the president of Norman Lear's Environmental Media Association, the David Geffen Foundation, and a corporate executive at DreamWorks. Establishing himself as an independent in 2006, Spahn was active in the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities during the Obama Administration. In 2017, he was called \\"Hollywood‚Äôs leading fundraising consultant to the powerful\\". Activism Spahn's first political activism was against the U.S. war in Vietnam at the age of 18. He was a draft resister, refusing to register his name for Selective Service, and he spoke to motivate others to resist. He dropped out for a year or two, which he later regretted. As a college junior at UC Berkeley in mid-1977, Spahn joined the newly formed activist group Campuses United Against Apartheid (CUAA). He traveled California telling university students how corporations divesting from South Africa could be used as a weapon against state-sanctioned apartheid. Spahn wrote an article, \\"Reinvestment\\", describing the extent that the University of California was investing in South Africa through its stocks, bonds and investments portfolio which put $792 million into multi-national corporations that did business in South Africa. Spahn proposed the UC system reallocate its investments to small businesses in California. Spahn also spoke against institutional racism and for affirmative action, referencing the ongoing Bakke case. In 1978‚Äì79, Spahn was active in the Berkeley-based Students for Economic and Racial Justice (SERJ), an anti-apartheid group collaborating with CUAA, and he was a vice president of the Associated Students of the University of California. Spahn graduated from the University of California, Berkeley. Tom Hayden in 2004 Spahn joined Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda's activist groups in the late 1970s, working for their Campaign for Economic Democracy as a political director. In 1983, Spahn assisted the Democratic Party primary campaign of Alan Cranston for president, which petered out in early 1984. Picking up from there, Spahn created the Democratic Entertainment Industry Project to coordinate fundraising efforts in Hollywood aimed to fight against Ronald Reagan's reelection run in that year's presidential election. The DEIP, part of the Hayden‚ÄìFonda circle of influence, channeled funds obtained from the Democratic National Committee and other groups to Walter Mondale's campaign, and it helped to birth in August 1984 the Hollywood Women's Political Committee. Working in Washington D.C. for a few years, Spahn served on campaign committees for George Mitchell and Tony Coelho, where he worked alongside Rahm Emanuel. He was the national finance director for presidential candidate Gary Hart in 1987, but Hart dropped out when reports revealed his marital infidelity. Spahn said that Hart's fall was a tragedy: \\"Hart came from progressive politics, [Bill] Clinton didn't. [Hart] was going to be the first of our generation to be elected president. We believed he was better prepared to govern... Unfortunately, he was not...\\"Ross 2011, pp. 347‚Äì348 Norman Lear in 2014 In April 1989, Spahn helped build Norman Lear's Environmental Media Association, to promote anti-pollution issues by integrating them into the storylines of television programs. Spahn served as president. Spahn said the EMA \\"hopes to generate a climate of concern about our environment and give creative expression to the vision of a healthy future for the planet.\\" Environmental issues were worked into television episode plots centrally or peripherally. The change could be as little as characters carpooling or recycling, or whole episode themes might be devoted to the topic, such as Thirtysomething main character Hope becoming an activist against pollution. Geffen and DreamWorks Jeffrey Katzenberg consults with Spahn In April 1993, music and film producer David Geffen tapped Spahn for the role of vice president of corporate affairs at Geffen Pictures. The next year, David Geffen joined with film producer Steven Spielberg and ex-Disney president Jeffrey Katzenberg to create DreamWorks SKG. At the beginning of 1995, Spahn began serving as head of corporate affairs at DreamWorks. Spahn guided DreamWorks' political donations during this period, including their fundraising efforts toward Al Gore's run for the 2000 U.S. presidential election. Spahn was described as the \\"gatekeeper\\" to the bank accounts of the trio of Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg, handling thousands of donation requests every year from individuals and groups seeking monetary support. While Spahn passed along certain meritorious requests, he necessarily said \\"no\\" thousands of times. Independent consultant In March 2006, Spahn founded Andy Spahn & Associates to advise wealthy clients, corporations and nonprofits about using their money to promote political issues. His top associate and co-founder was Jennifer Gonring who joined from DreamWorks. Rahm Emanuel introduced Spahn to Barack Obama Rahm Emanuel introduced Spahn to Barack Obama. Moved by Obama's political potential, Spahn directed Geffen's attention to him, a connection that brought Obama great financial support from Geffen, followed by Katzenberg and Spielberg. Spahn organized a fundraising event for Obama in February 2007 hosted by the DreamWorks trio, ending with a smaller dinner at Geffen's home; $1.3 million was raised for Obama in one night. After Obama was elected, Katzenberg and Spahn visited the White House many times. Spahn was listed as a bundler for Obama, and he served on the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Steven Spielberg spoke through Spahn about Darfur During 2007‚Äì2008, Spahn advised Spielberg on the political ramifications of the Chinese invitation for Spielberg to help filmmaker Zhang Yimou produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. China had been reported funding the Sudanese military's Darfur genocide in the western region of Sudan, and the news hit Spielberg personally after a March 2007 editorial piece in the Wall Street Journal written by Mia Farrow and her son Ronan. The Farrows compared Spielberg to Hitler's filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in their piece \\"The Genocide Olympics\\". Spahn told Spielberg that he was in a position of leverage, that he could try and shift China away from their harmful activities in Sudan. Accordingly, five days after the Farrow op- ed, Spielberg implied to China that he would resign unless they stopped opposing a United Nations peacekeeping force from entering the Sudan. Spahn raised the implication to an explicit statement made to the press that Spielberg would quit. In response, diplomat Zhai Jun toured refugee camps in Darfur, an unusual step for China. In July 2007, with pressure from Spielberg and from Farrow's Dream for Darfur campaign, China reversed their stance and supported a U.N. resolution to send 26,000 peacekeeping soldiers to Darfur. But Sudan stalled, blocking the U.N. entry, making conditional demands, and Spahn recommended Spielberg continue to apply pressure, which he did in November 2007 with another letter. China failed to break the Sudanese obstruction, so in February 2008, Spielberg resigned from the Olympics. In the 2000s, Spahn visited Cuba several times to gauge the political weather, and he coordinated Spielberg's visit to Havana in November 2002, calling for a lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. In 2009, the issue was raised again after Obama called for better relations with Cuba. Spahn criticized Senator Bob Menendez for holding up legislation which would ease trade. Later that year, Carlos Varela, \\"Cuba's Bob Dylan\\", visited Washington, D.C., and he attended a dinner organized by Spahn. Spahn said, \\"Everyone who has gone to Cuba comes out questioning our policy because what they see there is nothing like what they have been told by American politicians.\\" Spahn called for the release of the Cuban Five in 2010 and 2011. In late 2014, Obama pushed further to start the Cuban thaw, and when the president himself visited Cuba in March 2016, Spahn was there with him. In 2016 Spahn helped as fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/hillary-clinton-donald-trump- hollywood-1201878938/#!https://deadline.com/2014/10/hillary-clinton- fundraiser-midterms-jeffrey-katzenberg-steven-spielberg-host-855911/#! After WikiLeaks published John Podesta's emails in 2016, Spahn was speculated as a choice for Hillary Clinton's notional ambassador to Cuba. However, when Donald Trump won the election in 2016, all of Clinton's cabinet hopefuls were left behind. Spahn promoted co-founder Gonring to partner and CEO in 2014, changing the company name to Gonring Spahn, then in early 2020 he promoted ex- DreamWorks Jennifer Lin to partner, the firm now operating as Gonring Lin Spahn. The company continues to guide philanthropy for private and public clients, and they bundle millions of dollars for Democratic Party candidates. Personal life Spahn lives in Brentwood, Los Angeles, with his wife Jennifer L. Perry. They have a daughter, Kaysea Perry Spahn, born in 1990. In 1994, Spahn attended the wedding of Rahm Emanuel, who was at Spahn's own wedding. References External links *Andy J.

After 1945 she undertook work for the party, later becoming an East German diplomat. She served as her country's first Ambassador to Yugoslavia between 1966 and 1969. She was the president's youngest daughter.  Life  = Family provenance = Eleonore \\"Lore\\" Staimer, the youngest of her parents' three recorded children, was born in Bremen, one of Germany's largest port cities, at a time of accelerating social and political change, driven by rapid industrial and commercial expansion. Wilhelm Pieck, her father, was an active trades unionist and an instinctively adept political strategist. He was a carpenter by training and profession, but the year before Eleonore's birth he had taken a full-time position as party secretary with the by now increasingly mainstream Social Democratic Party (SPD). Her mother, born Christine H√§fker, had been a garments worker at the time of her marriage, and also at some point worked as a \\"home worker\\" for a Bremen cigarette factory: Christine H√§fker appears to have grown up in a relatively unpoliticised household. = Early years = Eleonore attended junior school briefly during 1912/13 in Berlin-Steglitz, after which the family evidently returned to Bremen where she attended middle school (\\"B√ºrgerschule\\") between 1913 and 1918. It was presumably in connection with her father's political involvement that in 1918/19 she was back in Berlin- Steglitz for her final year at school. Pieck had been on the anti-war wing of the SPD from the outset, and powerfully vocal in his opposition to the party's parliamentary support for war funding: Wilhelm Pieck joined the new Communist Party in January 1919, two and a half week after its launch. Eleonore Pieck as still only 14 when she joined the Young Communists later that year. She had already been a member of its socialist precursor organisation since 1918. More usually, in view of her age, sources also indicated that she joined the Communist Party in 1920. While still at school Elenore Pieck attended a succession of business college evening classes, undertaking courses in shorthand, typing, and book-keeping. There is also reference to half a year spent at a \\"household school\\" (\\"Haushaltsschule\\"), presumably mastering \\"domestic sciences\\". Between 1920 and March 1923 Elenore Pieck found office work with a succession of businesses. = Party worker / party official = In April 1923 she took a job as secretary-assistant to Leo Flieg, who at that time was one of two secretaries to the Organisation Office (\\"Orgb√ºro\\") of the party politburo - effectively the party's ruling committee of the party. She moved on to work as secretary-assistant to Gustav Menzel, a left-leaning lawyer who since 1921 had served as one of 31 communist members in the 421 seat Prussian Landtag (parliament). Mentzel's principal focus in the parliament was on securing proper treatment of political prisoners, but there are indications that Elenore Pieck's duties were relatively broadly based, and that her work for the parliament involved providing secretarial and administrative support to the entire Communist group in it. 1930 brought a change of direction, when Eleanore Pieck went to work for the (implausibly large) Soviet trade mission in Berlin. In 1932 she was sent to Moscow where she worked for the \\"Peoples' Commissariat for Foreign Trade\\". However, at the end of that year or the start of 1933 her contract was terminated \\"due to the insufficiency of [her] language skills\\". = Hitler years and Moscow exile = In January 1933 the Hitler government took power and quickly transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. By the end of February 1933 it was clear that known Communist Party activist members were at particular risk of enhanced surveillance by the security services, targeted government persecution and worse. Eleanore Pieck appears to have stayed on in Moscow despite no longer being employed by the Foreign Trade commission. Her parents and siblings all fled Germany during 1933, and by the end of 1935 they all seem to have been based in Moscow. Eleanore's mother died from a recurrence of her by now chronic pneumonia in a Moscow clinic at the start of December 1936. (The urn containing her ashes was returned to Germany in 1956.) By 1934 Eleanore Pieck was working as a typing assistant with the \\"Comintern Youth\\" organisation and the \\"Internationaler Revolution√§rer Theaterbund\\", which had been set up a few years earlier by her brother. Starting in 1934 she is identified as an \\"Agitprop Secretary\\". Between 1936 and 1940 she was in charge of the finance department for International Red Aid (\\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞ÃÅ—Ü–∏—è –ø–æÃÅ–º–æ—â–∏ –±–æ—Ä—Ü–∞ÃÅ–º —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—éÃÅ—Ü–∏–∏\\" / (–ú–û–ü–†)), a highly politicised international workers' welfare association that had been set up in 1922 under the auspices of the Comintern, of which her father served an Executive Committee member between November 1937 and the dissolution of the –ú–û–ü–† in 1941. In June 1941 the German army invaded the Soviet Union in defiance of the 1939 non-aggression pact between the dictators. Over the next few months the Soviet government implemented long-standing contingency plans for the evacuation of Moscow. Eleanore Pieck had married Josef Springer in 1939. In October 1941 she was evacuated, along with most or all the members of the Comintern apparatus, to Ufa in Bashkortostan, presumably accompanied by her husband, whom she had met through the Comintern. Her father was also among those evacuated to Ufa. During 1941/42 she was enrolled as a student at the Kushnarenkovo Comintern school which had opened up (disguised as an Agricultural College) when the Comintern evacuees had arrived from Moscow. Many of the political refugees from Germany who had settled in Moscow during the 1930s in order to get away from Hitler, and then been evacuated with the native Muscovites in 1941, were left in their remote places of exile for years. Others joined the hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war who had survived monumental military defeat at Stalingrad, only to end up in the Soviet camps. Party General Secretary Stalin was a famously mistrustful man at the best of times, and the arrival of three million well-equipped German soldiers on Soviet territory in June 1941, together with the ensuing slaughter and destruction, had evidently made him more mistrustful than ever of German people. But there were still a few German comrades whom he trusted. Wilhelm Pieck (who had been seriously ill as an evacuee in Bachkiria) returned to Moscow on 27 March 1942. It is not clear whether Eleonore and her husband accompanied him, but she was certainly back in Moscow by the end of 1942. During 1942/43 she was employed with International Red Aid as head of the department for Political Emigrants in the organisation's Soviet section. During 1943 she was recruited by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (Interior Ministry) to join a radio editorial team, as plans were drawn up for a German language radio station, intended to attend to the perceived (by the ministry) needs of the many German prisoners of War detained in the Soviet camps. After 1942 the likely outcome of the war became easier to predict, and over the next couple of years German defeat appeared ever more clearly on the horizon. In 1944 Eleonore became secretary to Anton Ackermann, a leading member of the (all-male) group of 30 trusted comrades working away in Moscow on the preparation a formidably detailed nation building programme, to be implemented in Germany once the National Socialist tyranny had been destroyed. (In the event it would be implemented only in the central third of Germany, administered from May 1945 as the Soviet occupation zone.) Later she also took an appointment as Youth Editor with the recently launched Moscow based broadcaster, \\"Radio Free Germany\\". =Post-war developments= Eleonore Springer returned to Germany on 28 May 1945 accompanied by fellow activist Margarete Lode (1902‚Äì1952), who subsequently became her sister-in-law, marrying Arthur Pieck in November 1945. (Her father had already arrived in Berlin with the Soviet army at the end of April 1945.) She moved at once to Stettin, at the north-eastern end of the Soviet occupation zone, where she stayed for a couple of months, undertaking various political jobs. She is described in a source as a party instructor, working on behalf of the ten member Gustav Sobottka sub-group of the thirty member Ulbricht Group of Soviet sponsored \\"nation builders\\". There is also a reference to her having worked as part of the editorial team for the (very short-lived) Stettin-based Deutsche Zeitung (newspaper). On 5 July 1945 the military occupation forces choreographed the transfer of Stettin from the Soviet zone of Germany to Poland, triggering another bout of ethnic cleansing in the process. Till August 1945 Elenore remained in the north of the Soviet occupation zone, now based in Schwerin, and a member of the party leadership team (\\"KPD- Landesleitung\\") for the newly established state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Initially she was deputy chair of the culture department, but as the party organisational structure rapidly evolved she was transferred in August 1945 to the business section of the secretariat and the national secretariat of the Communist Party and then, after April 1946, of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which replaced it. This brought her closer to the centre of political power under the highly centralised Leninist government structure that had emerged by 1949 in what had become a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. By this time she had been released from her job, in April, 1949 \\"due to illness\\". =Trade ministry= By September 1949 she was sufficiently recovered to embark on a new chapter, accepting a leadership appointment in the Foreign Trade department of the East German Ministry for Intra-German Trade, Foreign Trade and Materials Supplies. Between October 1953 and January 1957 she served as secretary of state and deputy minister. =Diplomatic service= In January 1958 she switched to the diplomatic service, sent as the East German permanent representative to Belgrade. Yugoslavia had become politically distanced from the Soviet Union during the 1950s, and the diplomatic relationship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union's central European \\"allies\\" was a correspondingly low-key affair. During the 1960s a slow and tentative rapprochement began, however, and in October 1966 Eleonore Staimer became East Germany's first ever ambassador to Yugoslavia, remaining in the post till February 1969. Her next posting was back in Berlin where she worked at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs till October 1970. =Later years= In November 1970 she became deputy director of the East German travel office, with her responsibilities focused on relationships with foreign travellers, publicity work and market research. She retired in 1975, following which she became actively engaged as a member of the Berlin committee of Anti-fascist resistance fighters, a heavily politicised patriotic-nationalistic organisation with close links to the ruling party. Personal Eleanor Pieck married Josef Springer in 1939. She had met him through her work with the Comintern. The marriage reportedly lasted till 1945. There is no reference to Springer having accompanied his wife when she returned from the Soviet Union to Germany in 1945. Between 1947 and 1954 she was married to Richard Staimer. The two of them had been evacuated to Ufa from Moscow in 1941, and had presumably got to know each other at that time. Available sources are almost entirely silent about both marriages.

He composed it in 1911, and it was first performed in March 1912. It was first published by √âditions Durand the same year. It has been described as the most inspired and best structured of his six organ symphonies.  History  Vierne, organist at Notre-Dame de Paris, continued the French tradition of secular organ symphonies, such as the works by his teacher Charles-Marie Widor, who had established the organ as a concert instrument. Widor was inspired by the organs built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll. Vierne composed the third organ symphony in 1911, beginning on 18 March. He completed it on 14 September during summer vacation which he spent with the family of Marcel Dupr√© in Saint-Valery-en-Caux, Normandy. He dedicated it to Dupr√©, who played the world premiere at the Salle Gaveau of Paris in March 1912. It was first published by √âditions Durand that year. Carus-Verlag published a critical edition of the complete organ works by Vierne in 2007, edited by Jon Laukvik and David Sanger.  Structure and music  The work is structured in five movements: # Allegro maestoso # Cantil√®ne # Intermezzo # Adagio # Final The first movement begins with \\"an aggressive call to arms\\" in \\"jagged rhythmic edges\\" which dominate the movement in sonata form. The rhythm is reminiscent of the French overture with a more lyrical second subject, skillfully combined with the first in the development section, with significant chromaticism. The second movement is soft in contrast, with long melodic hautbois phrases. The third movement has scherzo character in a triple metre, which can be seen as grotesque or playful. A second theme comes with a pizzicato bass. The fourth movement is marked \\"Quasi largo\\", and is homophonic and soft like the second, but using chromaticism reminiscent of Wagner. A \\"declamatory melody\\" in a middle section seems endless. When the opening theme returns, it is developed further. Vierne adapted this movement in his Piece symphonique for organ and orchestra in 1926, in preparation of a U.S. concert tour. The Final features typical elements of a French toccata, such as fast ostinato passages for the manuals versus a slow melody in the bass, but also uses counterpoint. It is again in sonata form, with an augmented bass in the development, and culminates in a coda with virtuoso pedal.

Software Productions and published by Microsoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 1998. It received praise for its graphics, but criticism for numerous glitches and its varying difficulty. It was followed by Microsoft Baseball 2000 and Microsoft Baseball 2001. Gameplay Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition includes all of the players, teams and ballparks from the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Players include Ron Gant, Lance Johnson, Mickey Morandini, Sammy Sosa, and Todd Stottlemyre. The game has three modes, including single game, season play, and playoffs. There is no home run derby or practice mode. The game has three difficulty settings, three swing types, and four pitch types. The game can be played in a manual mode or an assisted mode. The game includes the General Manager mode, in which baseball players' statistics can be edited, including their weight and height. Development and release Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition was developed by WizBang! Software Productions. The baseball players' actions were created through 500 motion-captured moves. Because of its graphics, the game can only be played with a 3D accelerator card. The game was originally scheduled for release in October 1997, but underwent additional development, before being released on July 1, 1998. It was published by Microsoft for Windows. The game shipped without multiplayer capability, although a patch was in development at the time to allow such a feature through the Internet. Reception Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition was praised for its graphics. Scott May of Computer Gaming World praised the animation and considered the graphics to be the best of any computer baseball game to date. The game was criticized for containing a number of audio and visual glitches. The artificial intelligence (AI) received criticism as well, although a patch was planned to correct this issue. Long load times were another subject of criticism, and the ball physics received a mixed response. Regarding the game's audio, GameSpot's Michael E. Ryan wrote, \\"Instead of complementing each other and fitting together to form a realistic game atmosphere, the various sound effects seem to be in constant conflict for your attention.\\" Dan Egger of PC Accelerator similarly criticized the uneven sound effects. Daniel Morris of CNN considered the gameplay to be mediocre, and Rick Worrell of Sports Gaming Network found it to be the least impressive aspect. Egger criticized the lack of a home run derby, and other reviewers criticized the lack of displayed statistics during season play. The difficulty modes were criticized, being described as either too easy or too hard. Tom Anderson of GameRevolution criticized the assisted mode, stating that \\"rather than assist you, the AI just takes over, moving your fielder to the ball and making the play all on its own.\\" Ryan wrote that it would have been better if \\"the computer simply gave you a little help starting the fielders in the right direction, then turned control over to you\\". During play, the game will sometimes rapidly change its camera angles for visual effect, although this was considered disorienting by some critics, who viewed it as one of the reasons for the game's difficulty. Anderson found the pitching and batting interface difficult to master, and the controls too responsive. Paul Rosano of The Hartford Courant wrote that the game \\"produced some fine features, but along with most of its competitors, it also falls down in enough other areas to make an unqualified recommendation impossible.\\" May stated that the game's problems \\"can't be ignored or dismissed. But then again, neither can its considerable strengths.\\" Anderson only recommended the game for \\"the most dexterous button pushers\\", although he felt that the game could be worthwhile with fine-tuning in a later release. Worrell called the game a \\"noble, if ultimately flawed, effort\\", writing, \\"This could have been a great title. Unfortunately, there are so many bizarre bugs and inconsistencies. [...] it would take the mother of all patches to fix this game. Barring that, I cannot recommend that you buy it.\\" References External links * Official website, archived via the Wayback Machine * Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition at MobyGames Category:1998 video games Category:Major League Baseball video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in 1998 Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition"},{"id":"65323632","text":"Albert Moeschinger (10 January 1897 ‚Äì 25 September 1985) was a Swiss composer.  Life  Born in Basel, Moeschinger, son of a merchant, completed his musical studies in Bern, Leipzig (composition with Paul Graener, piano with Robert Teichm√ºller) and Munich (composition with Walter Courvoisier). After several seasons as an ensemble pianist in caf√© houses, Moeschinger settled in Bern, where he taught privately as a piano and theory teacher, and from 1937 also at the University of the Arts Bern, and resumed his compositional activities. In 1943, health problems led him to settle in the Valais mountain village of Saas Fee. From this time on, he devoted himself exclusively to composition. Reading Thomas Mann's musical novel Dr. Faustus and the subsequent correspondence with the writer in 1948 encouraged him to integrate the twelve-tone technique into his work. After 1956, Moeschinger lived mainly in Ascona. He spent the rest of his life in Thun, where he died on 25 September 1985 at the age of 88.Tonaufnahmen mit Werken des Komponisten aus dem Archiv von SRG SSR at Neo.Mx3 Moeschinger's oeuvre, which includes all genres except opera, comprises over 400 titles.

It is primarily residential, mostly single-family homes with a few two-family. Commercial development is entirely on its principal street, Whitney Avenue. ,Neighborhood Scout overview of Spring Glen It was developed throughout the first half of the twentieth century as a trolley suburb of New Haven. It was named for the Spring Glen dairy farm established by James J. Webb in 1858 in what would become part of the neighborhood. There are no officially established boundaries for the neighborhood. The Spring Glen Civic Association has it bounded on the north by Skiff Street, on the east by Hartford Turnpike, on the south by Waite Street (including three small streets extending a bit south of Waite), and on the west by Lake Whitney and Mill River. This definition includes a small portion of the adjoining town of North Haven. , Spring Glen Civic Association The census tract with GEOID 09009165500, corresponding closely to the Hamden portion of the neighborhood, had a population of 4,959, as of the 2010 census. History First known use of the Spring Glen name, for J.J. Webb's farm, on an 1868 map of Hamden. A road on the ridge north of East Rock, now Ridge Road, was laid out in 1745 to access farms in the area now known as Spring Glen. The Cheshire Turnpike, now Whitney Avenue, was built in 1800, leading to farming of the land on the western side of the ridge. One of these farms was purchased in 1858 by James J. Webb, who had previously traded in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He tested improvements in dairy farming at the farm which he named Spring Glen. The trolley line from New Haven along Whitney Avenue was extended to Centerville in 1902, leading to the first subdivsion of farmland in the area for houses. In 1924, the town of Hamden built the first Spring Glen School, leading to the subdivision of more farms including Webb's and commercial development on Whitney Avenue. Some distinctive houses in the neighborhood were designed by the architect Alice Washburn, who felt that since \\"society had placed women in charge of domestic affairs, they were uniquely qualified to design houses.\\" Development of the neighborhood was complete by 1967. Government The Town of Hamden provides all municipal services for the neighborhood, except the small portion which is part of North Haven. It is located in Connecticut's 3rd congressional district. The neighborhood is in the 11th state senate district. Most of it is in the 88th state house district with small portions in the 91st. , Hamden state district map The portion of Spring Glen west of Whitney Avenue is in the 4th district of the town legislative council with the east side in the 6th. , Legislative Council district map It is served by the Whitneyville post office with ZIP code 06517. Transportation CT Transit routes 228 and 229 operate on Whitney Avenue. Both begin at the New Haven Green with 228 terminating in the Centerville neighborhood and 229 in downtown Waterbury. Route 224 serves Ridge Road and Hartford Turnpike on weekdays only. , New Haven Metro Area bus system map An interchange of the Wilbur Cross Parkway and an access to the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail are near the northwest corner of the neighborhood. Education Public elementary school students in Spring Glen and some other parts of Hamden attend Spring Glen School. All Hamden students then attend by Hamden Middle School and Hamden High School. , Hamden Public Schools Also in the neighborhood are Saint Rita School, a Catholic school with pre-kindergarten to grade 8 , St. Rita School and Lorraine D.

Critics considered the game to be an improvement over its predecessor. It received praise for its graphics and $20 price, but was criticized for containing various glitches. It was followed by Microsoft Baseball 2001. Gameplay Microsoft Baseball 2000 is an updated version of its predecessor, Microsoft Baseball 3D 1998 Edition. It features Major League Baseball (MLB) players, and 30 MLB stadiums. Players include Kevin Brown, Mark McGwire and Curt Schilling. It has several game modes, including QuickGame. There is also a training mode for pitching and fielding, while a home run derby mode allows for batting practice. Seasons consist of 162 games. Microsoft Baseball 2000 has three difficulty settings, and includes commentary by Thom Brennaman. The game also includes the General Manager, which allows the editing of baseball players' traits. Development and release Microsoft Baseball 2000 was developed by WizBang Software Productions, which also developed the previous game. Unlike its predecessor, the graphics of Microsoft Baseball 2000 do not require a 3D accelerator card to run, although the game does support the use of one for enhanced visuals. Brennaman spent eight days providing his dialogue as the game's commentator, and much of the script called for various inflections of each comment, contributing to the lengthy process. Brennaman, describing his voiceover experience, said, \\"You have to do the best you can while imagining plays in your mind. You have to act like it's taking place in front of you.\\" Microsoft Baseball 2000 was completed in April 1999, and was released in the United States later that month. It was published by Microsoft for Windows. The game was priced at $19.95 in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic. Baseball player Al Leiter is featured on the game's cover. Later in 1999, an updated MLB player roster was released for download through the game's website. A patch was also released that allowed for multi-display. Reception Critics viewed Microsoft Baseball 2000 as an improvement over its predecessor, although some still considered High Heat to be a superior baseball game choice. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel considered the game to be near-perfect. Joel Strauch of GamePro praised the improvement in gameplay and controls, while GameSpot's Michael E. Ryan praised the addition of a mid-range difficulty setting. Ryan stated that Microsoft Baseball 2000 had the best pitching interface of any baseball video game, although he described fielding as \\"very tough\\" and stated that the game's computer-assisted base running was problematic. Joshua Roberts of AllGame wrote that the game \\"has just the bare minimum and there's nothing in its actual gameplay to make up for its glaring omissions.\\" The graphics were praised, as was the game's $20 price. The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that the game \\"offers the best budget baseball experience on the PC this summer, and also one of the best at any price.\\" Reviewers criticized various audio and visual glitches that are present in the game. Jason Bates of IGN complained of frequent lock-ups during gameplay, and Strauch noted long loading times. Scott Silverstein, writing for The Washington Times, stated that it took four attempts across an 80-minute period to get the game running on a computer which had easily met the system requirements. Rick Worrell of Sports Gaming Network criticized the commentary for a number of audio glitches, but he praised the sound effects. Roberts found the commentary to be stiff, while other critics praised it.

It preserves fossils dating back to the early Cretaceous period.Zeller 1965Zeller and Alper 1965 Description The formation consists mostly of alternating beds of limestone and shale, but with massive upper reef limestone beds (varying from in thickness) and some massive calcarenite beds towards the middle of the formation. Its total thickness is . The massive reef limestones cap ridges that are steep on one side but dip gently on the other. The formation has gradational contacts with both the underlying Hell-to-Finish Formation and the overlying Mojado Formation. Although fossils are abundant, they tend not to be age-specific. However, careful study of the fossils has yielded an age of Aptian to middle Albian. Fossils The lowest beds of the formation contain only small pelecypods, but abundant oyster fossils are found further up in the formation. The alternating shale and limestone beds contain fossil echinoids, the foraminifer Orbitolina, the gastropod Lunatia praegrandis Roemger, and small oysters. The upper part of the formation contains massive fossil bioherm reefs. Orbitolina is also found above the reef beds, in the uppermost part of the formation.

The bill proposes to divest taxpayer dollars from policing and invest in alternate, community-based approaches to public safety. Champions of the bill include Ayanna Pressley, Democratic Representative of Massachusetts's 7th congressional district and Rashida Tlaib, Democratic Representative of Michigan's 13th congressional district. Tlaib said in a virtual unveiling of the BREATHE Act with the Movement for Black Lives that \\"Our communities in the 13th and I are committed to fully engaging with this legislation seriously and with a sense of urgency.\\" Background The drafting of the legislation was preceded by a series of killings of Black Americans by white police officers in 2020, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as many others including Tony McDade, Natasha McKenna, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Elijah McClain, Pearlie Golden, Kayla Moore, Freddie Gray, Atatiana Jefferson, Oscar Grant, and more. The bill was unveiled on July 7, 2020 as protests and uprisings against police brutality were happening throughout the country. The Electoral Justice Project, a project of the Movement for Black Lives, drafted the BREATHE Act, in response to the pleas of Black people killed at the hands of law enforcement officers, and who told those officers they couldn't breathe before their deaths. Organizers of the BREATHE Act capitalized on the momentum from the summer 2020 protests and a discernible shift in public opinion to push for policy change at the level of the federal government. \\"We crafted this bill to be big,\\" Gina Clayton Johnson, one of its creators and the executive director of Essie Justice Group, said during a live-streamed announcement event, \\"because we know the solution has to be as big as the 400-year-old problem itself.\\" Political context After a number of highly publicized killings of Black Americans at the hands of police officers, most notably the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a series of uprisings began to spread around the country. In response to these uprisings, and the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) called for a series of coordinated Juneteenth actions. On July 6th, just after Independence Day and on the heels of weeks of sustained protest, M4BL unveiled The BREATHE Act as a legislative intervention based on its Vision for Black Lives. In July 2020, in advance of the Democratic National Convention, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, spoke at the Democratic National Committee's virtual party platform meeting. Cullors called out the Party for rejecting platform amendments that included criminal justice, policing, and legal system reforms. She called on the Democratic to support the BREATHE Act, saying \\"without the sea changes our movement recommended for the 2020 Democratic platform, any claims to allyship and solidarity with our work to fight for Black liberation are for naught.\\" Later in August, during the Democratic National Convention, famous actors including Jane Fonda and Kendrick Sampson, released a video reading the rejected amendments and called for them to be added to the DNC platform. On August 28, 2020, the Movement for Black Lives hosted the first virtual Black National Convention which aimed to set forth \\"a vision for Black Lives before the biggest election of our time, and long after.\\" The convention, a callback to the 1962 National Black Political Convention, presented a multi-hour virtual broadcast featuring the activists like Tarana Burke, Brittany Packnett Cunningham, and hosted by Pose star Angelica Ross. During the convention, the BREATHE Act was presented as a policy solution to meet the moment addressing issues like police brutality, climate disaster, and reparations. Provisions The BREATHE Act is an omnibus bill that addresses police brutality and racial injustice by advocating for numerous reforms. The legislation is divided into 4 sections, which call for the following: *Section 1: Divesting Federal Resources from Incarceration and Policing & Ending Criminal Legal System Harms *Section 2: Investing in New Approaches to Community Safety Utilizing Funding Incentives *Section 3: Allocating New Money to Build Healthy, Sustainable & Equitable Communities for All People *Section 4: Holding Political Leaders Accountable & Enhancing Self-Determination of Black Communities The bill, in part, would \\"divest\\" federal resources from incarceration and policing, institute changes to pretrial detention, sentencing and prosecution, and also reduce the Department of Defense budget. It would establish a Neighborhood Demilitarization Program that would collect and destroy military-grade equipment held by law enforcement agencies such as armored vehicles. The bill also would end life sentences, abolish mandatory minimum sentencing laws and create a specific timeline to close federal prisons and immigration detention centers. Some of the proposals in the bill, such as the plan to abolish ICE, piggyback on similar calls dating back to 2018. The BREATHE Act's most notable diversion from past reform efforts is its explicit demand that Congress repeal the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, colloquially known as the \\"crime bill.\\" For example, the BREATHE Act would repeal both the \\"three-strikes law,\\" which when it passed in 1994 was seen as a rule that would deter repeat criminal activity, and the modern Taser, which was developed in the '90s by a private company and subsequently marketed as a way to prevent police killings as an alternative to firearms. The bill's supporters argue that these practices and policies have been harmful and dangerous.

In such cases the M-M bonding is weak as signaled by longer M-M bonds and the tendency of such compounds to dissociate in solution. Supported metal-metal bonds An early example of a supported metal-metal bond is cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer, [(C5H5)Fe(CO)2]2. In the predominant isomers of this complex, the two Fe centers are joined not only by an Fe-Fe bond, but also by bridging CO ligands. The related cyclopentadienylruthenium dicarbonyl dimer features an unsupported Ru-Ru bond. Many metal clusters contain several supported M-M bonds. Some examples are Fe3(CO)12 and Co4(CO)12. Multiple metal-metal bonds Structure of hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungstenIII), an example of a metal-metal triple bond. In addition to M-M single bonds, metal pairs can be linked by double, triple, quadruple, and, iin a few cases, quintuple bonds. Isolable complexes with multiple bonds are most common among the transition metals in the middle of the d-block, such as rhenium, tungsten, technetium, molybdenum and chromium. Typical the coligands are œÄ-donors, not œÄ-acceptors. Well studied examples are the tetraacetates, such as dimolybdenum tetraacetate (quadruple bond) and dirhodium tetraacetate (single bond). Some ruthenium acetates have M-M bond orders of 2 and 2.5. Hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungsten(III) is a well studied example of a complex with a metal-metal triple bond. The structure of chromium(II) acetate, which features a quadruple bond between the Cr centers.

Historically, drug use was often sanctioned and encouraged by militaries through including alcohol and tobacco in troop rations. Stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines were widely used in both World Wars to increase alertness and suppress appetite. Drug use can negatively affect combat readiness and reduce the performance of troops. Drug use also poses additional expenses to the health care systems of militaries. Drugs =Alcohol= Alcohol has a long association of military use, and has been called \\"liquid courage\\" for its role in preparing troops for battle. It has also been used to anaesthetize injured soldiers, celebrate military victories, and cope with the emotions of defeat. In the Russo- Japanese War, alcohol has been implicated as a factor contributing to the Russian loss. Russian commanders, sailors, and soldiers were said to be drunk more than sober. Countries often enabled alcohol use by their troops through providing alcohol in their rations. The British Royal Navy maintained alcohol rations until 1970. There is a strong association of military service and alcohol use disorder. In 1862, British soldiers in India responded to the threat of problematic alcohol use by establishing the Soldiers' Total Abstinence Association, which became the Army Temperance Association in 1888. Similar organizations formed in other branches of military and for British troops stationed in other colonies. Members of these abstinence associations were encouraged to sign pledges to avoid alcohol entirely. Medals were awarded to individuals who remained abstinent. Studies show that Australian veterans of the Gulf War had a prevalence of alcohol use disorder higher than any other psychological disorder; UK veterans of modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan had higher rates of alcohol use disorder than servicemembers who were not deployed. =Amphetamines= Pervitin, an amphetamine used in World War II Amphetamines were given to troops to increase alertness. They had the added benefits of reducing appetites and fatigue. Germany, in particular, embraced amphetamines during World War II. From April to July of 1940, German servicemembers received more than 35 million methamphetamine pills. German troops would go as many as three days without sleep during the invasion of France. In contrast, Britain distributed 72 million amphetamine tablets during the entire war. =Caffeine= Military use has contributed to the rise of caffeine as the world's most popular drug. During the American Civil War, each Union troop received a coffee ration of annually. World War I saw the dramatic rise of instant coffee: by the end of the conflict, daily production was , a 3,000% increase from pre-war production. =Cocaine= World War I saw the greatest use of cocaine amongst militaries. It was used for medical purposes and as a performance enhancer. At the time, it was not a controlled substance, and was readily available to troops. The British Army distributed cocaine- containing pills under the brand names of \\"Forced March\\" and \\"Tabloid\\", which were advertised to suppress appetite and increase endurance. In response to a moral panic about the effects of cocaine on society, the British Army Council passed an order in 1916 that prohibited the unauthorized sale of psychoactive drugs like cocaine and opiates to servicemembers. =Hallucinogens= Franciscan scholar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n wrote that the Chichimeca people of Mexico consumed the root of the peyote, a cactus, to stimulate themselves for battle. In his 1887 Historia del Nayarit (English: History of Nayarit), Jos√© Ortego also wrote that it was a favorite stimulant in warfare. It has been speculated that berserkers, who were Scandinavian warriors, used the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria to enter a trance-like state before battle. Karsten Fatur thought it was plausible that instead of A. muscaria, berserkers consumed the plant Hyoscyamus niger (known as henbane or stinking nightshade). While both A. muscaria and H. niger can result in delirious behavior, twitching, increased strength, and redness of the face, H. niger is additionally known to have pain-numbing properties. =Opiates= During the American Civil War, opiates were the most effective painkillers available to military surgeons. They were also used to treat diarrhea, muscle spasms of amputees, gangrene, dysentary inflammation from gunshot wounds, and to sedate agitated troops. The Union Army requisitioned 5.3-10 million opium pills throughout the war, and a further 2.8 million ounces of opiate preparation (such as laudanum). Many veterans of the war had opiate addictions. Opiate addiction became known as \\"soldier's disease\\" and \\"army disease\\", though though precise effect of the American Civil War on the overall prevalence of opiate addiction is unknown. As a result of World War I, hundreds of thousands of soldiers developed severe opiate addictions, as morphine was commonly used to treat injuries. =Tobacco= A Japanese-American soldier, wounded during an attack, receives cigarettes from English actress Madeleine Carroll Tobacco has been viewed as essential to maintaining the morale of troops. Starting with the Thirty Years' War in Europe, major military encounters caused a surge in tobacco usage, mostly stemming from soldiers' use. During World War I, US Army General John J. Pershing noted, \\"You ask me what we need to win this war. I answer tobacco as much as bullets. Tobacco is as indispensable as the daily ration; we must have thousands of tons without delay.\\" This sentiment was echoed by US Army General George Goethals, who noted tobacco was as important as food, and US medical officer William Gorgas who said that tobacco promoted contentment and morale, and the benefits outweighed any potential health risks. Such was the tobacco consumption of its troops that the US Government became the single-largest purchaser of cigarettes, including cigarettes in troops' rations and at discounted prices at post exchanges. Health and social impacts Heavy drinking, tobacco use, and use of illegal drugs are common in the US military. Alcohol consumption in the US Military is higher than any other profession, according to CDC data from 2013-2017\\\\. American troops spend more days per year consuming alcohol than those in other professions (130 days), and additionally spend more days binge-drinking than those of other professions (41 days). Substance-use disorders were often attributed to moral failure, with the US Supreme Court ruling as recently as 1988 that the Department of Veterans Affairs did not have to pay benefits to alcoholics, as drinking was a result of \\"willful misconduct\\". Substance use can adversely affect combat readiness, with tobacco use negatively impacting troop performance and readiness. It can also be costly: In 2006, the cost of tobacco use to the Military Health System $564 million.

Her research considers mammalian carnivores and conservation.  Early life and education  Harris was born in Philadelphia. Her mother was a biology teacher, and she used to bring home frogs for Harris to dissect. She was a regular visitor at the Philadelphia Zoo, and was selected to join them in Kenya as part of an animal rehabilitation mission at the age of thirteen. Her first job was working as an apprentice in the education centre at the Zoo. Harris earned her bachelor's degree in wildlife science at Virginia Tech. She was recruited by Lisa Schabenburger, who continued to serve as her mentor throughout her early career. After Virginia Tech, Harris earned her master's degree at the University of Montana. At Montana, Harris investigated the demography of ungulates. She moved to North Carolina State University as a graduate student, where she studied the biogeography of carnivores and parasites. In 2010 Harris was appointed an emerging leader at the Philadelphia Zoo. After earning her doctorate, Harris joined the University of California, Berkeley, where she was awarded both an National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship and President's postdoctoral fellowship. At Berkeley Harris worked as a community ecologist, where she studied tropic cascades in West Africa.  Research and career  After completing her fellowship, Harris moved to Switzerland, where she joined the Luc Hoffmann Institute at the World Wide Fund for Nature. At the Hoffman Institute Harris oversaw the Miombo woodlands in South Africa, where she looked to evaluate how conservation areas contributed to biodiversity and human livelihoods. In 2015 Harris joined the University of Michigan, where she studies the biogeography of ecological communities. She leads the Mesoniche Project, which looks to understand the behaviour of mammalian carnivores in various sites across Michigan using an elaborate network of camera surveys. The sites included the Huron Mountains, Upper Peninsula and Detroit, and sought to introduce local communities to their native wildlife. As part of the study, she evaluated the interactions between mammals and humans in national parks. In an interview with The Mich, Harris explained that her presence in the project did not only impact the scientific research, but also challenged public expectations of who does science, ‚ÄúPeople are not used to seeing people of color, let alone a woman of color, talk about wildlife,‚Äù. Harris has conducted a camera survey of West African countries including Niger and Burkina Faso. Whilst she had expected to primarily document poaching activity, Harris mainly observed livestock grazing and gathering of forest products. The programme looked at the impact of humans on communities of mammals living in the protected area known as the W-Arly-Pendjari Complex (WAP). Harris leads citizen science projects, partnering with the Zooniverse to create a crowdsourced platform for image identification. The project, Michigan ZoomIN, encourages members of the public to identify the spatial habitats of Michigan's mesocarnivores.

Completed and commissioned in March 1944, she served in World War II and took part in the Marianas campaign and the Philippines campaign before she was sunk in October 1944. Construction and commissioning I-54 was laid down on 1 July 1942 by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 627. Launched on 4 May 1943, and on the same day was both renamed I-54, the second submarine of the name, and provisionally attached to the Kure Naval District. She was completed and commissioned on 31 March 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-54 was attached formally to the Kure Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet for workups. =Marianas campaign= The commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands on 13 June 1944. The Marianas campaign began with the U.S. landings on Saipan on 15 June 1944. I-54 departed Yokosuka on 7 July 1944, bound for Saipan towing an Unpoto gun carrier, a sled that could carry up to 15 tons of cargo, usually in the form of three Type 96 howitzers and ammunition for them. Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an Allied signals intelligence unit headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, intercepted and decrypted a Japanese message that day stating that I-54 was due to arrive at Tinian on 14 July 1944 to evacuate Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service personnel. Saipan fell to American forces on 9 July 1944, and I-54 was ordered to nearby Tinian that day. She lost her Unpoto sled in heavy seas. On 10 July 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet. On 15 July, FRUMEL intercepted and decrypted another Japanese message saying that I-54 was scheduled to arrive at Tinian on 18 July. She returned to Yokosuka on 24 July 1944. =Philippines campaign= Toyoda activated Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands on 13 October 1944. That day, I-54 was assigned along with the submarines , , , and to Submarine Group A under the direct command of the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure on 15 October 1944 with orders to attack the aircraft carriers of United States Navy Task Force 38 and the crippled light cruiser . On 18 October 1944, I-54 received orders from the 6th Fleet to join 12 other submarines in patrolling east of Leyte in the Philippines. I-54 was assigned a patrol area east of the Philippines between the areas assigned to the submarines and , and she was expected to arrive in her patrol area on 25 October 1944. The Battle of Leyte began with the U.S. landings on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and that day I-54 acknowledged an order to change her patrol area. She transmitted another message on 23 October 1944, the first day of the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23‚Äì26 October 1944. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= The circumstances of I-54‚Ä≤s loss remain unknown. At 12:18 on 28 October 1944, the destroyers and detected a submarine attempting to penetrate the screen of United States Navy Task Group 38.4 ‚Äî which included the aircraft carriers , , , and ‚Äî east of Leyte. While the aircraft carriers steered away from the submarine contact at high speed, Gridley made three depth charge attacks against the submarine and Helm made four. After Helm‚Ä≤s fourth attack, which took place at 14:11, a large explosion followed by two smaller ones occurred. Oil and air bubbles appeared on the surface, and damaged deck planking and human remains were recovered after the attack. The submarine sank at . On both 30 October and 1 November 1944, I-26, I-46, and I-54 all failed to make scheduled daily 19:00 status reports. On 20 November 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-54 to be presumed lost east of the Philippines with the loss of all 107 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 March 1945. The identity of the submarine Gridley and Helm sank remains a mystery, and has been reported both as I-46 and I-54. Some sources have credited that the destroyer escort with sinking I-54 in the Philippine Sea on 26 October 1944 while screening Task Group 77.4, although the submarine Richard M. Rowell attacked probably was , which survived. Notes Sources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-54: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on September 15, 2020.

It aired in the United States on ABC on October 16, 2018. The episode was directed by Andy Ackerman, and written by Bruce Helford, Dave Caplan, and Bruce Rasmussen. The Conners, a sequel spin-off of the long-running series Roseanne, stars John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, Lecy Goranson, Michael Fishman, Emma Kenney, Ames McNamara, Jayden Rey, and Maya Lynne Robinson as the titular family. The series was created following the abrupt cancellation of the successful Roseanne revival due to racist tweets from star Roseanne Barr. The episode follows the Conner family as they begin to deal with the death of the family's matriarch Roseanne. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics, and was watched live in the United States by 10.56 million viewers. Plot Three weeks after Roseanne's death, the family is still grieving. The family finds out that Roseanne didn't die from a heart attack as they had originally thought, but rather from an opioid overdose. Dan blames their neighbor Marcy Bellinger, who gave Roseanne the pills they found in her closet, for her death. Later after learning Roseanne had also gotten pills from other sources, and after talking with Marcy, Dan decides to stop blaming her. Dan also helps Mark decide which boy he likes, Jackie grieves by trying to reorganize the kitchen, and Geena returns home from Afghanistan. Lastly, Dan, after sleeping on the couch since Roseanne's death, decides to sleep in his bed again. Production =Development= Due to the success of the tenth season of Roseanne, ABC renewed Roseanne for an eleventh season on March 30, 2018, three days after the premiere of the tenth season. However, on May 29, 2018, ABC cancelled Roseanne due to racist tweets by star Roseanne Barr. The following day, it was announced that a spin-off of Roseanne centered on the rest of the family was being discussed by the producers of the series, as the cast was already under contract for another season of Roseanne. On June 21, 2018, it was announced that ABC had ordered ten episodes of a Roseanne spin-off, The Conners, and that the other five principal cast members were all set to return for it. On August 31, 2018, it was announced that Barr's character Roseanne Conner, would be killed off. That same day, it was announced that production had begun on the episode. =Casting= On August 28, 2018, it was announced the remaining three cast members from the tenth season of Roseanne, Emma Kenney, Ames McNamara, and Jayden Rey, were all set to join John Goodman, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf, Lecy Goranson, and Michael Fishman on the new series. On September 14, 2018, it was announced that Maya Lynne Robinson had been cast as Geena Williams- Conner, replacing Xosha Roquemore who played the character in the tenth season of Roseanne. Reception =Viewing figures= In the United States, the episode was watched live by 10.56 million viewers, making it the second most watched show of the night in terms of number of viewers, behind only NCIS. It was the most watched show of the night in terms of 18-49 rating, with a 2.4, and in terms of ratings share, with a 10. Within seven days, the episode was watched by a total of 13.65 million viewers. The viewership on the episode was considerably lower than that of the tenth season of Roseanne, which averaged 17.85 million viewers over it's nine episodes, though it is currently the most watched episode of The Conners. =Critical response= Kimberly Potts with Vulture said, \\"I‚Äôm still not totally sold on whether or not The Conners can continue to have a reason to exist without Barr. But the premiere shows they know why we‚Äôve loved these characters for three decades now, and why we‚Äôre interested in seeing how they, as individuals and as a family, will maneuver their grief, evolve through it. That‚Äôs enough of a reason for the Conners, and The Conners, to soldier on, and enough to keep me tuning in.\\" She also gave the episode 5 out of 5 stars. Scott Collura with IGN said, \\"The Conners successfully moves on without Roseanne, focusing squarely on the family of the title who were always essential to the original show anyway. Do things feel different without Roseanne? Sure. Does The Conners suffer from her absence? So far, not at all.\\" He also gave the episode an 8.3 of 10. =Accolades= Editor Brian Schnuckel was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, in the category of Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series, at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, for his work on the episode.

About 12,000 Kurdish refugees, who fled the civil war between Kurds and the Turkish state in the 1990s, live in this refugee camp.  Background  In 1994, the refugees fleeing the Kurdish villages close to the Turkish Iraqi border were initially based in a camp in Atroush, further north, but in 1997, the Atroush camp was closed by the after Turkey made accusations that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) recruited members amongst its inhabitants. Following, a major part of the inhabitants accepted an offer by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to move to Makhmur and another group moved to Ain Sifni. From Ain Sifni the refugees had to flee fighting between the PKK and the KDP, who was supported in its fight by the Turkish army. The Refugees then settled to Sheikan, but their situation remained dire as the KDP did not allow the UNHCR to provide help to the refugees. Eventually the World Food Programm and the UNHCR managed to gain access to the refugees. Then the refugees opted to also move to Makhmur and join the other former inhabitants of the Atroush Camp.  Makhmour camp  The Makhmur camp was established in 1998. The camp receives the support of the UNHCR, which helped them to provide the refugees with legal documentation in 2011, which allows them to access to education and health services. Holders of the residency permit are also permitted to apply for work provided by the Government. In 2014, as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), captured large areas of Iraq, the Makhmour Protection Units (MPU) where established. The same year, Masoud Barzani, then the president of the KRG visited the camp, after the Kurdish forces evicted ISIL from the Kurdish regions south of Erbil. From July 2019 onwards, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has limited the liberty of movement of most of the inhabitants of the camp in such way, that many have lost their jobs outside of the camp and the health services were not been able to be provided in an adequate way, the Human Rights Watch reported in November 2019. Dindar Zebari from the KRG, stated that the measure was taken out of security reasons. The refugee camp and its surroundings are often a target for Turkish airstrikes. Makhmur Camp was bombed for 40 minutes during Operation Claw-Eagle (2020), launched by the Turkish Armed Forces on 15 June 2020. A Turkish official spoke to the BBC after the operation, \\"We carried out an operation in Mahmur more than a year ago, we destroyed their warehouses. We saw that they made new storage in a year.

First women reporter at the Daily Express later top woman editor at the Daily Telegraph  Life  Peacocke was born in 1882 in Darlington. Her parents were Mildred and John Marshall and she was their first child. The house was devoted to journalism. Her mother was from a journalist family as her mother's father edited the Newcastle Chronicle. Emilie's father was co-proprietor and editor of the Northern Echo. In time she would have five siblings. The Northern Echo was a Liberal paper and her upbringing was liberal. She was taught at hime and she was allowed free reign in choosing her own reading. Her hero was Jessie White Mario who she knew due to connections from her family. By the age of fifteen she was proof reading the Northern Echo using her skills. She was promoted and she later recorded how she was smug as she cycled home at three in the morning knowing that she knew the news that others would not know until the read the paper she had helped to create. In 1903 the family were in London when her father died. He had lost his job in Darlington when he refused to support the newspaper's line that was in support of the war in South Africa. The family were short of money and she was obliged to find work. She had failed to find work because she was a woman in Darlington and the prejudice continued in London. Newspapers employed women but usually just one and they could not see why they might need two. Peacocke became a reporter for the Church Family Newspaper where her gender still caused issues as women were not allowed into some church meetings. She became the first woman reporter at the Daily Express where she was paid the same as a man. She won a pay rise after she gained a scoop by obtaining a copy of the new hymn book. The book contained new hymns and controversially excluded some well known hymns. In 1929 she led the \\"women's department\\" at the Daily Telegraph. That January she was invited to a dinner to honour Lady Rhondda which included many of the leading women in Britain at that time. Other invitees were Vera Brittain, Rebecca West, Edith Shackleton and Cicely Hamilton. In 1936 she wrote \\"Writing for Woman\\". She worked at the Telegraph until 1941. Death and legacy Peacocke died at her home in Kensington which she shared with her daughter Marguerite D. Peacocke who was also a leading journalist.

Born in London - in Lincoln's Inn Fields by some accounts - he worked for several years as a clerk for the South Sea Company before turning to acting.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.186 Ireland Throughout the 1720s he was a member of the Smock Alley Theatre company in Dublin, Ireland's leading theatre of the era. While there he married the Irish actress Mary Lydall, with whom he had two children. After her death he remarried to a relation of hers Anna Marcella Lydall, who thereafter acted under the name Mrs Giffard.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.186-87 In 1726 he briefly appeared in at Drury Lane in London appearing in Henry IV and The Recruiting Officer, but then didn't return to the London stage for three years. Goodman's Fields Theatre In 1729 he appeared at Thomas Odell's Goodman's Fields Theatre appearing in a wide variety of different roles in classic plays often appearing alongside his wife. After some brief work at the King's Theatre in Haymarket he took over management of Goodman's Fields Theatre from the 1731-32 season.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.187 He supervised construction of a new playhouse on Ayliff Street with a capacity of around seven hundred. In 1735 he returned to tour Ireland, appearing at the new Aungier Street Theatre in Dublin. Back at Goodman's Fields in 1736 he celebrated the marriage of George II's daughter Anne and William of Orange with a revival of Richard Steele's popular The Conscious Lovers. However during the 1736-37 season he moved his company to the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. Although initially denying this mean that the Goodman's Field venue had been abandoned by the company, he soon after unsuccessfully tried to sell it.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.189-90 His further progress was dramatically ended by Prime Minister Robert Walpole's strict new Licensing Act 1737 which meant that he could no longer legally stage plays in London because he didn't control one of the patent theatre licences. He then went back to Ireland, appearing once again at the Smock Alley Theatre and then moved to Edinburgh. In London he joined the Drury Lane company, playing Sir Harry Wildair in The Constant Couple amongst other roles. Much of his time was spent lobbing officials to allow him to-reopen the Goodman's Fields Theatre, and in 1740 he was finally given permission to do so. It was around this time that he discovered the actor David Garrick and began casting him in productions at Goodman's Fields, beginning with the title role in Richard III in which Giffard played Henry VI and his wife and son William Giffard both also appeared. Despite the profitable performances of the emerging star Garrick, the actor-manager Giffard struggled financially particularly when Garrick left the company. Giffard again tried to base himself at Lincoln's Inn Fields, but his attempt to establish a third top- flight London theatre alongside Drury Lane and Covent Garden had essentially failed.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.192-93 Later years From 1742-1747 he played in both the Drury Lane and Smock Alley companies as an actor once more. Around this time he was admitted to the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks. His final London season was at Covent Garden in 1748, after which he retired to Brentford west of the capital.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.192-93 Selected roles * Honorio in The Rival Generals (1722) * Stanza in The Widow Bewitched (1730) * Essex in The Fall of the Earl of Essex (1731) * Scandenberg in Scanderbeg (1733) * Mirzabdi in The Parricide (1736) * Addle in The Independent Patriot (1737) * Riot in The Wife's Relief (1737) * King Charles in King Charles I (1737) * Henry IV in Richard III (1741) * Dumont in Jane Shore (1743) * Briar in Love the Cause and Cure of Grief (1743) * Sir Harry Wildair in The Constant Couple (1743) * Alcanor in Mahomet the Imposter (1744) References Bibliography * Highfill, Philip H, Burnim, Kalman A. & Langhans, Edward A.

Three years later, it was removed by the right-wing new local government. The removal prompted debate on how Spain should interpret the legacy of Al- Andalus, the Muslim realms of the Middle Ages. Background Abd al-Rahman III, the eighth and final Emir and first Caliph of C√≥rdoba, ordered the construction of Cadrete's castle in 935 AD while in the area to crush a rebellion by the Banu Tujib vassal dynasty. A bust commissioned in his honor was unveiled on 18 June 2016 in the town's Plaza de Arag√≥n, and celebrated with a medieval fair. The bust was sculpted by Fernando Ortiz Villarroya of Teruel. Ortiz is linked to Cadrete as his partner is from there. He took no payment for his work, though casting it in bronze cost ‚Ç¨7,000 of public money. He characterises the work of art as \\"a simple portait. It has a stern facial expression because he was a leader, but also tender because it is stylised\\". Controversy and reactions =Removal= Ortiz said that in 2017 a member of the far-right Vox political party struck the bust with a 4x4, and another group vandalised it with paint. He chose not to press charges. In June 2019, local elections resulted in the right-wing People's Party needing an alliance with Citizens and Vox to form government. Three days after the new government was formed, Vox's proposal to remove the bust was enacted. The explanation was that it allegedly caused \\"division and confrontation\\" and that the prominence of the Plaza de Arag√≥n required symbols identifiable to all residents. All opposition parties and Citizens condemned the removal, with Podemos local leader Nacho Escart√≠n asking if the statue of Augustus Caesar ‚Äì namesake of Zaragoza ‚Äì would be removed from that city. The bust was removed to the third floor of the town hall, where there is an information centre about the castle, with the promise that it would be displayed at an upcoming museum at the castle. Around 50 people protested the removal. The information centre closed in June 2020. =Remarks on removing statues of historical figures= Columnist V√≠ctor Orc√°stegui of the Heraldo de Arag√≥n argued that the logic of removing the bust would also apply to the statue of Augustus as he was a foreign pagan invader, and drew a parallel between Vox's activism and that of Barcelona left-wing mayor Ada Colau against that city's statue of Christopher Columbus. Ortiz disagrees with suggestions that the Law of Historical Memory that bans public memorials to the regime of Francisco Franco could also be used to remove statues of medieval conquerors like Abd al-Rahman III, as well as of conquistadores like Hern√°n Cort√©s. In July 2020, the Cadrete episode was brought up in the Parliament of Andalusia by Pilar Gonz√°lez of the left-wing Adelante Andaluc√≠a party amidst the context of debate over statues due to the George Floyd protests; she said it was hypocritical for the right-wing to pick and choose when to preserve or remove statues. =Historian= Jos√© Luis Corral, a medievalist from the University of Zaragoza, accused Vox of rewriting history for political motives. He said that Abd al-Rahman was no more of a dictator than his Christian monarch opponents, as was the nature of life a millennium ago. He added that Al-Andalus could not be classed as a foreign occupation, as there is no historical or genetic evidence for mass migration of Arabs, rather the inhabitants converted. Abd al-Rahman's physical appearance and genealogy has been mentioned by Corral to justify the caliph as a Spaniard and not a foreigner. He had fair-coloured eyes, skin and hair, and according to the Muslim chronicler Ibn Hazm, he dyed his hair dark to justify his rule as a descendant of the prophet Muhammad. His immediate female ancestors were born in the Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian peninsula; five generations of Cordobese leaders, from Abd al-Rahman III's great grandfather to his own grandson, were born to Basque women who were married for alliances or taken as slaves.

The Valley has three towns: Eden, Huntsville, and Liberty. Only Huntsville is incorporated as a town. Eden and Liberty are census-designated places. Eden and Liberty share a post office. The Valley has one local newspaper, Ogden Valley News. Several nonprofit organizations serve Ogden Valley. The Ogden Valley Land Trust preserves open space through conservation easements.

The county uses a master plan, published in 2016, as a guide for development. The Utah Geological Survey studied the water resources of the Valley and published their results in 2019. Peter Skene Ogden entered the valley on May 16, 1825 with a band of trappers employed by the Hudson's Bay Company. William Kittson was in the group as well and drew a map of the area. They were trapping beaver as part of the company's campaign to eliminate all the furbearing animals between British-controlled territories and U.S. territory in order to keep American fur hunters from entering the Oregon Country. The HBC band left the Valley a few days later, but returned on May 25 after American trappers drove them away from Mountain Green at Deserter Point. In 1849 Captain Howard Stansbury of the U.S. Army explored the valley during an expedition to Northern Utah with Jim Bridger.

History The area now covered by Goodramgate lay within the walls of Roman Eboracum. The street runs diagonally across the line of former Roman buildings, from the Porta Decumana (now King's Square, to the Porta Principalis Sinistra (now Monk Bar). Anglo-Saxon artifacts have been found in the area, while its name dates from the Viking Jorvik era, being named after someone called \\"Guthrum\\" or \\"Gutherun\\". The street was first recorded in about 1180. In the Mediaeval period, the street lay in the parish of Holy Trinity Church, although since 1316 the church has been hidden from the street, behind Lady Row. The precinct of York Minster lay immediately north of the street, and until the early 19th-century, was entered through a gateway. Part of this may survive in the rebuilt structure at the entrance to College Street. The original site of the York Dominican Friary may have been on the street, although it moved to Toft Green in 1227. By this time, the street contained some large, stone, houses, associated with wealthy merchants. Many Mediaeval buildings survive on the street, although some were destroyed when its south-western end was widened in 1771, or when Deangate was constructed in 1906. Several non-conformist churches have existed on the street, including the Methodist Monk Bar Chapel, while the former Lecture Hall was used by Baptists and then Presbyterians. Sanderson's Temperance Hotel, later the Victoria Hotel, was used by the Swedenborgians and the Primitive Methodists. The street has long been a centre for retail, with a market created in 1502 for beds, mattresses and upholstery. It is now lined with shops, bars and restaurants, including two small supermarkets built in the 1960s. Layout and architecture View west along Goodramgate The street runs north-east from the northern tip of King's Square, where it meets Church Street and Low Petergate, to Monk Bar on the York city walls, beyond which its continuation is Monkgate. College Green lies off the north-western side of the street, where it meets Deangate and College Street. Ogleforth and the snickelway Monk Bar Court also lead off the north-western side, while Aldwark, Bedern, and Powells Yard lead off the south-eastern side. Notable buildings on the south-east side of the street include 13, 15, 17, 23, and 25 Goodramgate, all with 16th-century origins; 31 and 33 Goodramgate, also of Mediaeval origin; the 15th-century 41-45 Goodramgate; the Snickleway Inn and Wealden Hall; and the 17th-century 53 Goodramgate. On the north-west side, they include Lady Row, with Holy Trinity Church behind; 6-10, and 12 Goodramgate, both with 17th-century origins; the Royal Oak and Golden Slipper, both with 15th-century origins; 17th-century houses at 22 and 24 Goodramgate; 30 and 32 Goodramgate, with parts dating from the 1380s; 38 and 40 Goodramgate, with 15th-century origins; and the Old White Swan, with a 16th-century wing.

The purpose of SB 946 is to decriminalize and legalize street vending throughout the state. The proposal defines ‚Äúsidewalk vendor‚Äù as a person who sells merchandise or food from a pushcart, stand, display, pedal-driven cart, wagon, showcase, rack, or other non-motorized conveyance on a sidewalk or pedestrian path. SB 946 states a vendor can be a ‚Äúroaming sidewalk vendor‚Äù, which is someone who moves around to vend, or a ‚Äústationary vendor‚Äù, someone who just stays in one place to vend. SB 946 applies to charter cities in terms of local authority. The purpose of SB 946 is to let local law enforcement not fine or regulate street vendors where sidewalk traffic is light and is not infringing upon activity within the area. If local authorities wish to regulate sidewalk vending, they have to be consistent with SB 946. If a city does not have any sidewalk vending legislations and wishes to implement new ones, they also have to be consistent with SB 946. If local authorities have regulations that are consistent with SB 946, no further action is needed. If they have regulations that are not consistent with SB 946, adjustments to these laws will have to be adjusted. Any sidewalk vending regulations that are adopted or enforced by local authority must follow specific standards \\"SB 946 also imposes time, place, and manner restrictions on sidewalk street vending.\\" A local authority is not required to enforce all or some of these restrictions. If any additional restrictions other than the ones above are to be enforced, it must be directly related to objective health, safety, or welfare concerns. \\"SB 946 allows but does not require a permitting program for local sidewalk vendors.\\" These programs must accept specific ID documents in lieu of a social security number. The collected number is confidential. SB 946 does not limit or affect any state food safety laws, including the California retail food code. SB 946 does not allow any criminal charges, but may allow administrative fines. A violation of the local authority‚Äôs vending programs is only punishable by the following fines: $100 for the first violation, $200 for the second violation, and $500 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. If the local authority requires a vending program, the authorities can impose higher fines for vending without a permit: $250 for the first violation, $500 for the second violation, and $1000 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. On the fourth and any subsequent violation, the local authority can rescind a permit. SB 946 applies to any pending criminal charges or vindicates any prior convictions.

The appeal was upheld, ruling that the tort of misfeasance in public office is never actionable without proof of material damage as defined by Lord Bingham of Cornhill. Facts The respondent, Mr Watkins, was a convicted prisoner serving a life sentence and was imprisoned at all times material to the action. As a result of being involved with legal proceedings, he had brought about correspondence with his legal advisors, the courts and other bodies. Mr Watkins was held at two prisons, Wakefield Prison and subsequently, Frankland Prison. He raised a number of complaints that his mail had been opened and read at both prisons, breaching the prison rules; in particular, breaching the protection of confidentiality of his legal correspondence under the provisions of Rule 37A of the Prison Rules 1964 (SI 1964/388) and Rule 39 of the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999/728). The rules provided that a prisoner‚Ä≤s legal correspondence could only be opened and read if the governor had reasonable cause to believe that the mail contained an ‚Ä≤illicit enclosure‚Ä≤. Mr Watkins issued proceedings against the Home Office and fourteen named prison officers, claiming damages for misfeasance in public office. He claimed that the officer‚Ä≤s interference with his mail had been deliberate and malicious and that this established the necessary element of intent for the tort of misfeasance in public office to apply. The action was first heard on 15 July 2003 at Leeds County Court before Judge Ibbotson who found in favour of the defendants, despite finding that three of the fourteen prison officers had acted in bad faith when dealing with the claimant‚Ä≤s legal correspondence. For the tort of misfeasance in public office to be actionable, the claimant would have to show that he had suffered loss or damage, since damage is at the heart of the tort and material damage must be alleged. The claim was dismissed from the County Court as Mr Watkins failed to make representations that he had suffered any injury, loss or damage as a result of the instances of interference with his legal mail. On 20 July 2004, the case went to appeal before Laws LJ, Brooke LJ and Clarke LJ in the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal where the appeal was unanimously allowed, although the Home Office was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords. A nominal award of ¬£5 in general damages was entered against the three defendants. The court was not convinced by the arguments that suggested the ‚Ä≤floodgates‚Ä≤ would open if the claimant was to seek adequate redress. Lord Justice Brooke stated: \\"...It is now well established that a prisoner does not lose his right of access to a court when he goes through the prison gate.\\" The Court of Appeal felt that the question of an award of exemplary damages should be remitted to Judge Ibbotson at the County Court as they did not have sufficient information to make the determination. Judgment In February 2006, the appeal was heard before the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and the judgment was handed down on 29 March 2006. The question before the House was whether the grounds on which the Court of Appeal had permitted the appeal were correct. The Appeal Court had allowed the appeal on the grounds that the public officer‚Ä≤s interference with the respondent‚Ä≤s right to proper unhampered access to the courts and legal advice had infringed a constitutional right and this negated the need to demonstrate actual losses or proof of damage, leading to the tort of misfeasance in public office being actionable. It was established that Watkins had not suffered any \\"material damage\\" and this made his action challenging. Therefore, the House of Lords ruled that the tort of misfeasance in public office was never actionable without proof of material damage. =Tort of misfeasance in public office= In 2003, the House of Lords held in Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 3) [2001] UKHL 16, [2003] 2 AC 1 that for the tort of misfeasance in public office to be actionable there had to be the essential ingredient of bad faith.

Each elected official will serve until 2026. Issues =Light rail transit= Hamilton's light rail transit (LRT) project has been a contentious issue since proposals surfaced in 2008. Supported by Hamilton city council and Metrolinx, the transit agency responsible for projects across the Toronto and Hamilton areas, the new rapid transit system was intended to ease congestion on the city's Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) system. In September, 2008, a city-commissioned survey found that 94% of Hamiltonians surveyed supported investment in rapid transit with 66% supporting light rail transit (LRT), 8% favouring bus rapid transit (BRT), and 20% endorsing either option. The proposed BLAST Network in Hamilton Following Doug Ford's election as Premier in 2018, the provincial government maintained tacit support for the city's LRT project, with Ford telling Eisenberger if \\"[you] want an LRT, [you'll] get an LRT\\". In a surprise move, Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney announced in December 2019 that the province would no longer support the project, citing a new cost estimate of $5.5 billion. By August 2020, it was revealed that the revised $5.5 billion estimate was overinflated, as it included 30 years of capital and operating costs. Initial capital costs were estimated at $2.3 billion, prompting NDP leader Andrea Horwath to say \\"It's very clear the minister of transportation and [Premier Doug Ford] pretty much made this stuff [the new costs] up.\\" The provincial government suffered from notable backlash and opted to strike a task force to study alternatives to LRT. The resulting report confirmed earlier reports, indicating that LRT was a viable system, but provided the option between LRT and a bus rapid transit (BRT) system. Councillors Collins (Ward 5), Jackson (Ward 6), Clark (Ward 9), Pearson (Ward 10), Johnson (Ward 11), Whitehead (Ward 14), and Partridge (Ward 15) all announced they either preferred BRT or wanted it to be studied further, while Councillor Ferguson (Ward 12) indicated he was uncertain regarding either proposal. The Federal Infrastructure Minister, Catherine McKenna, indicated that, were LRT to be revived by the provincial government, the federal government would consider providing funds to the project. In September 2020, Metrolinx announced plans to demolish 21 buildings it had purchased along King Street East between \\"The Delta\\" (the intersection of King and Main Streets) and Wellington Street in preparation for LRT construction. During the mayor's annual State of the City address in October 2020, Eisenberger said that the province was considering reviving the LRT project, but was waiting for federal, municipal, and private-sector buy-in. =Commonwealth Games= In 2019, a group of prominent local developers and investors created the Hamilton 100 Committee - an organization seeking to bring the 2030 Commonwealth Games to Hamilton in honour of the city's hosting the first games in 1930. In April 2020, the Commonwealth Games announced that, after a bid from Calgary was rejected, no other Commonwealth city intended to bid for the games in 2026 and, should Hamilton want to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games, there would be no competition for the bid. While City Council intended to hear from the Hamilton 100 Committee (renamed Hamilton2026) in August 2020, the committee requested a delay until October 2020 to finalize their proposal. During the summer of 2020, over 500 Hamiltonians signed a petition opposing the Commonwealth Games bid. Designer Matt Jelly critiqued the plan, noting ‚ÄúThe city has a long waiting list for housing, and more and more in the pandemic the problem is pretty visible. It‚Äôs not abstract: we either spend that money on Games or on things we actually need.\\" Kojo Damptey of the Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion similarly critiqued the bid, telling The Spectator ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to spend money on public health, housing, and transit, and other initiatives that will ensure the safety of residents of the city.‚Äù In October 2020, Flamborough-Glanbrook MPP Donna Skelly announced that the province was unlikely to support the city's 2026 bid as it had allocated significant resources to supporting a bid for Toronto to serve as the Canadian host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Skelly encouraged the city to consider a bid in 2027 or 2030. =Ranked Ballots and Ward Boundaries= In November, 2016, councillors rejected an attempt by then councillor Matthew Green (Ward 3) to initiate a study into the feasibility of ranked balloting. Opponents of the plan called ranked ballots \\"confusing\\" and worried they would hinder voter turnout. Council then voted 9‚Äì5 against making any moves toward the change. After the 2018 election, the issue was once again raised by council. During this attempt, council voted 8-7 against a move to ranked ballots for 2022. Mayor Eisenberger and Councillors Wilson (Ward 1), Farr (Ward 2), Nann (Ward 3), Merulla (Ward 4), Danko (Ward 8), and Clark (Ward 9) voted in favour of the move, while the remainder of council opposed the change.Joey Coleman Twitter. \\"Hamilton City Council votes 8-7 against considering ranked balloting for the scheduled 2022 municipal election. In Favour: 1,2,3,4,8,9,Mayor Opposed: 5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14 #yhmcc #HamOnt\\", Twitter (Accessed September 28, 2020) A debate appeared in the Hamilton Spectator in the fall of 2020 about Hamilton's ward boundaries. New wards were created in 2018. Spectator sports columnist Scott Radley wrote in the Hamilton Spectator that city council should move to an at-large system. Radley made the argument that an at-large system would make councillors think about the needs of different areas and discourage councillors from acting like lords or ladies of a fiefdom. PhD candidate in urban political geography Chris Erl wrote a response saying Hamilton needed to keep wards and have elected neighbourhood councils like in Los Angeles or Montreal to make it easier for women, youth, LGBTQ people and people of colour to run and to connect people to city government. In October 2020, as part of the provincial government's \\"Supporting Ontario's Recovery Act\\" omnibus bill, it was announced that the right for municipalities to hold elections using a ranked ballot would be revoked. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark said that \\"Now is not the time for municipalities to experiment with costly changes to how municipal elections are conducted\\". This provincial act would forcibly change London, Ontario's electoral system and prevent Hamilton from pursuing a ranked ballot. =Hamilton Pride violence= During the annual Pride Hamilton celebrations in Gage Park in June 2019, an agglomeration of anti-gay Evangelical Christian preachers, Yellow Vest protesters, and supporters of the far-right Canadian Nationalist Party converged on the Pride celebrations with the intent to incite violence. A group of activists attempted to erect a curtain between the anti-gay protesters and the Pride festivities, but were attacked. In the immediate aftermath, the Hamilton Police Service was condemned for not responding to the violence and, following the attack, arresting some of the activists attempting to shield Pride participants from the protest. In late July 2019, the Hamilton Police Service also arrested Christopher Vanderweide, a Kitchener-based ultra- nationalist and white supremacist behind much of the violence, using a helmet to attack Pride participants Among the 'counter-protesters' arrested were Cedar Hopperton, a local anarchist activist, who Hamilton Police said was violating parole by attending the event. There was some contention as to whether Hopperton, a trans person who had previously been arrested after a vandalism spree by local anarchists on Locke Street, was actually at Pride. In response to their arrest, Hopperton began a hunger strike while held at the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre. Hopperton was released from jail in July 2019 after a parole hearing found insufficient evidence to place Hopperton at Pride. In an attempt to mend relations, Mayor Eisenberger appointed LGBTQ+ community members Deirdre Pike and Cole Gately to liaise with the city's LGBTQ+ community. This move was critiqued by Cameron Kroetsch, chair of the city's LGBTQ+ Advisory Committee and candidate for Ward 2 (Downtown) councillor in 2018, who said, \\"There is a lot that has to happen before people are going to feel comfortable sitting down with the mayor\\". LGBTQ+ community members across Hamilton criticized Eisenberger's extremely delayed response to the Pride violence and the characterization by Councillor Sam Merulla that blamed people \\"on both sides\\". LGBTQ+ community activists Darren Stewart- Jones, Graham Crawford, and Chris Erl all took issue with Eisenberger's handling of the situation, with the latter critiquing the mayor's \\"excruciatingly slow response and lack of leadership\\". A independent review of the Pride violence and of the Hamilton Police Service response was conducted by Toronto lawyer Scott Bergman. Bergman's report was released a year following the violence and condemned the police response as well as the Hamilton Police Chief, Eric Girt, for making incendiary comments following the violence. Bergman also confirmed the protesters were more numerous than in previous years, writing \\"There was an increased number of agitators and many were from the yellow vest movement and from more militant, hateful groups.\\" In September 2020, Vanderweide plead guilty to assault ans was sentenced to anger management counselling. =\\"Sewergate\\"= On January 16, 2019, councillors received a report from city staff describing a malfunction in the city's sewage system that allowed 24 billion litres of raw sewage to spill into Chedoke Creek and Cootes Paradise, a wetland designated as a National Historic Site. The following September, councillors received a follow-up report on the matter. The reports recommended that the public not be made aware of the incident for fear of legal action against the city. In October, the Hamilton Spectator obtained the confidential reports on the matter and published a story outlining the details, prompting the city to respond. In their response, the city noted that a gate in a sewage holding tank had been left open since January 2014 and that the city did not know why the gate had been left open for years. By December 2019, councillors had dropped an internal investigation into the identity of the 'whistleblower' who informed the Spectator of the reports and had admitted to failing to contact partners such as the City of Burlington and the Royal Botanical Gardens to notify them of the sewage spill. Chedoke Falls leading into Chedoke Creek Mayor Eisenberger and council were blasted by members of the public and by Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath, whose Hamilton Centre riding counts Chedoke Creek as one of its borders. Despite calls for his resignation, Eisenberger instead said he intended to stay on as mayor and expressed interest in seeking a fourth term in office. =Integrity and Code of Conduct Violations= In September 2020, retiring councillor Sam Merulla (Ward 4 - East Hamilton) was the subject of a complaint to the city's integrity commissioner. A woman from Kitchener lodged the complaint after Merulla called the woman a \\"fucking punk\\" and threatened to \\"pay [her] a visit\\". The woman, an employee of a company that supplies weightlifting equipment, was the customer service representative handling a dispute between Merulla and her company over $300 worth of kettlebells. The woman called the police, fearing for her safety, and alleges Merulla sent threatening emails using his City of Hamilton account, which identified him as a member of council. While reporting on the story, CHCH reporter Matt Ingram asked Merulla about the complaint. Merulla proceeded to berate Ingram, saying \\"I refuse to be fucking exploited by you or anyone\\". CHCH News had previously filed an integrity commissioner complaint against Merulla in 2019 after he threatened a reporter covering the violence that occurred during Hamilton Pride 2019. Councillor Terry Whitehead (Ward 14 - West Mountain), was also the subject of a complaint to the city's integrity commissioner in September 2020. In July, Whitehead sent an email to advocates for Hamilton's homeless community who had requested to appear before council. The profanity-laden email circulated on social media, with Whitehead writing \\"You want to tun Hamilton into Sanfransico [sic]? Shit, unine, needles and other harmful Paraphernalia [sic] on our streets...Shelters are in place and we need to re econsider [sic] institutionalize [sic] people that are a danger to themselves.\\" Whitehead was strongly criticized by local activists and the media, with the Spectator editorial board writing \\"this seems an uncivil response to a constituent, and the fact that any elementary school teacher would give the councillor‚Äôs spelling and grammar an ‚ÄòF,‚Äô Whitehead seems to think that removing encampments removes the problem. And seems almost proud to repeat dehumanizing, degrading stereotypes about homeless people.\\" After a complaint was submitted to the city's integrity commissioner, Whitehead dismissed the complainants as \\"activists\\" and expressed his belief that his comments and stance on the city's homeless population could make him \\"mayor tomorrow\\". On September 28, 2020, the chair of the city's LGBTQ Advisory Committee, Cameron Kroetsch announced that Hamilton City Council had filed an official complaint against him with the city's Integrity Commissioner. In May, 2019, Kroetsch had been a guest on the Bill Kelly radio show on CHML and had critiqued both the city's new appointee to the Hamilton Police Board and how the city handled the revelation that a long-time employee in the IT department had been a known and active white supremacist. Kroetsch had then tweeted minutes from the city's LGBTQ Advisory Committee that contained information the city clerk had recommended be redacted. The city's use of the Integrity Commissioner to launch an investigation of a local resident was unprecedented and was critiqued by residents as an attempt to silence dissenting voices in the city. On September 29, 2020, CBC Hamilton reported that HWDSB Trustee Carole Paikin-Miller (Ward 5) had filed a complaint against fellow trustees Maria Felix Miller (Ward 3), Cam Galindo (Wards 9 and 10) and Paul Tut (Ward 13), asserting that they violated the school board's Code of Conduct when they appeared in support of former student trustees and community members speaking out against racism on the board. During the press conference, former student trustee Ahona Mehdi accused an unnamed trustee of using a racial slur when referring to tennis star Serena Williams. The three trustees named in the complaint, as well as board chair Alex Johnstone (Wards 11 and 12) stood in support of Mehdi and other students and, following the event, Tut also tweeted that any trustee using racist language should be removed from office. Paikin- Miller's complaint noted that the attendance of the three trustees named in the complaint violated the board's policy on \\"procedural fairness and unbiased process.\\" Mayoral election =Candidates= Declared * George Rusich, 2018 mayoral candidate * Edward Graydon, perennial candidate Potential * Fred Eisenberger, incumbent, Mayor of Hamilton 2006-2010 & 2014‚Äìpresent * Brad Clark, Ward 9 (Stoney Creek) councillor 2006-2014 & 2018‚Äìpresent, Progressive Conservative MPP for Stoney Creek 1999-2003 * Andrea Horwath, Leader of the Ontario NDP, MPP Hamilton Centre 2004‚Äìpresent, Ward 2 (Downtown) councillor 1997-2004 * Paul Fromm, neo-Nazi, Holocaust- denier, and white-supremacist, 2018 mayoral candidate * Terry Whitehead, Ward 14 (West Mountain) councillor 2018‚Äìpresent, Ward 8 councillor 2006-2018 Declined or Ineligible * Nathalie Xian Yi Yan, 2018 mayoral candidate, Ward 6 (East Mountain) council candidate 2006 and 2010 City Council Election =Candidates= Declared * Al Bunn (Ward 3), UFCW Locals 175 & 633 union steward at Fearman's Pork Potential Declined or Ineligible * Sam Merulla, Ward 4 (East Hamilton) councillor 2000‚Äìpresent * Doug Conely, Ward 9 (Stoney Creek) councillor 2014-2018 * Lloyd Ferguson, Ward 12 (Ancaster) councillor 2006-present * Bryan Wilson, 2018 second-place candidate in Ward 14 (West Mountain) Trustee elections =Candidates= Declared Potential Declined or Ineligible Mid-term elections Less than a year after the 2018 elections, HWDSB trustee Chris Parkinson (Ward 3 - Hamilton Centre) died suddenly of a heart attack at age 53.

In around 1728 she married the English actor Henry Giffard who had been acting at Smock Alley for some years. He had previously been married to Mary Lyddal, probably Anna Marcella's sister, with whom he had two children including William Giffard. After the marriage she was generally styled Mrs Giffard on playbills.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.195 She accompanied her husband to London in 1729 and frequently appeared alongside him over the coming years. She made her British debut at the Goodman's Fields Theatre, and this became a base for the couple after Henry took over management of the company and attempted to turn it into the third major London theatre, despite operation without a patent. The Licensing Act 1737 largely ended this attempt, and in subsequent years they played in many theatres around Britain and Ireland as well as the Drury Lane, Covent Garden and Haymarket Theatres.

It received protection as a National Historic Site in 1926. Overview The Ushizuka Kofun is located on the south bank of the Kurokawa River, to the northeast of the center of Mibu Town. It is part of a group of tumuli which include the nearby Kurumazuka Kofun and Atagozuka Kofun, which have different shapes, and which have separate National Historic Site designations. The Kuramazuka Kofun, the largest in Tochigi Prefecture, is adjacent to the east, while the Atagozuka Kofun is located 450 meters to the south. The mound is a built in two tiers, with base platform having a total length of 46.5 meters. The base has a circular platform that is 34.5 meters in diameter and a rectangular extension with width of 25 meters, and is five meters high. It is surrounded by a moat. On this platform, the kofun itself was constructed, with a length of 40 meters circular portion with dimeter of 27.6 meters. The tomb has never been excavated, but from its design and from fragments of haniwa which have been recovered from the vicinity, it is estimated to date from the late-6th century. This was a period of transition between the Kofun period when the Shimotsuke area was ruled by semi-independent local kings owing fealty to the centralized Yamato state. Its size, and location near other large tumuli and the site of the Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji indicate the importance of this region in Kofun period Shimotsuke.

It received protection as a National Historic Site in 1970. Overview The Azuma Kofun is located on a narrow plateau between the Ogawa and Sugata rivers, which run north and south through the northern Kant≈ç Plain. As a result of an archaeological excavation from 2007 to 2010, it was determined that the tumulus is a built in two tiers. The lower tier (base) is wide, and with a total length of about 128 meters was found to be the largest in the prefecture. The second tier is about 86 meters long with a height of about 10 meters. The two-tiered mound is set on a base of similar shape, and is surrounded by a moat with a width of about 20 meters and a depth of about three meters. Pumice deposits from the 1108 AD eruption of Mount Asama were confirmed from the soil filling the moat. The burial facility is a horizontal hole type stone chamber with dimensions of 2.4 meters long x 1.7 meters wide x 2.0 meters high; however, during the Edo period, the front part of the rectangular portion of the tumulus was destroyed, and the entrance stone and one of the ceiling stones were removed by the daimy≈ç of Mibu Domain for use as ornamental stones in the gardens of Mibu Castle, where they can still be seen. The entrance stone was of cut tuff with a rectangular opening for a door, whereas the ceiling stone (and remaining stones in the walls and remaining ceiling of the burial chamber) are of monolithic diorite. Red pigment was applied to the walls of the burial chamber, which was backfilled for preservation after the 2010 excavation. The surface of the tumulus is covered with fukiishi stones. Fragments of cylindrical and house- shaped haniwa have been recovered. The tumulus is a representative example of a kofun of the late Kofun period, from around the latter half of the 6th century. Recovered artifacts, including small objects of gold and copper found in the burial chamber, are on display at the Shimotsuke Fudoki-ga-oka Museum at site, which is located approximately eight minutes by car from Mibu Station on the T≈çbu Railway Utsunomiya Line.

After finishing high school in Manitowoc, she began studying home economics at the College of Saint Teresa, but graduated in 1923 with a degree in chemistry and three minors including mathematics. She worked as a high school mathematics teacher in Minnesota from 1923 to 1928, taking vows as a nun in the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota in 1927. In 1928, Schulte returned to the study of mathematics as a graduate student at the University of Michigan, primarily taking summer courses there while also becoming an instructor at the College of Saint Teresa. She earned a master's degree in 1931 and completed her Ph.D. in 1935. Her dissertation was supervised by Louis Charles Karpinski. Although taking a leave to complete her doctorate, Schulte remained at the College of Saint Teresa, earning a promotion to full professor in 1948 and retiring in 1975. In the early 1960s, a local television station broadcast a series of her lectures.

Other names for the Warrington hammer include joiners' hammer, English pattern hammer, and Warrington pattern hammer. The main striking face of the hammer is typically slightly rounded to minimise accidental marring or damage to the workpiece, while the opposite side of the hammer head is a pointed cross peen. The cross peen is designed for hitting nails, pins and brads held between the thumb and finger, and can also be help while reshaping bent nails and hardware. The design is well suited for cabinet making and hammering in small nails. The Warrington hammer name has been in use since at least the 1860s, and likely takes its name from the town of Warrington in Cheshire, England.

He was the son of the actress Sarah Hamilton. His aunt was the actress Anna Marcella Giffard. Along with his brother James, he first appeared on stage in January 1735 at the Goodman's Fields Theatre in London as a child actor. Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.55 They continued to appear together in London at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane until 1739 when they returned with their parents to Dublin and worked at the Smock Alley Theatre. Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.55-56 His activities are unclear for a while after this, but as an adult he no longer performed with his brother. It is likely the same William Hamilton who performed in Edinburgh in 1749 and then became part of the Smock Alley company between 1749 and 1758. From 1766 he was back in London where he appeared at the King's Theatre and then joined Samuel Foote's company at the Haymarket Theatre.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.63 He split his time over the next few years appearing at the Haymarket in the summer and Covent Garden in the winter. He was reportedly the initial choice to play Tony Lumpkin in the original production of Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer (1773) but lost the part due to a lack of attention.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.63 After this his prominence declined, and he made his final appearances in both theatres in 1774. He then began touring again and apart from appearances in Edinburgh and Belfast his later years are unknown. It is possible he was still alive in 1805, and one report had him supported in his final years by his niece.Highfill, Burnim & Langhans p.63-64 Selected roles * Duke of Gloucester in King Charles I (1737) * Laird in A Trip to Portsmouth (1773) References Bibliography * Highfill, Philip H, Burnim, Kalman A. & Langhans, Edward A.

Tottonpolynoe contains a single species, Tottonpolynoe symantipatharia. It is known from the South Pacific Ocean and Southern Ocean at depths of about .Pettibone, M.H. (1991). Polynoid polychaetes commensal with antipatharian corals. Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. 104(4): 714-726., available online at https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34809416 Description Tottonpolynoe symantipatharia is a long-bodied scale worm comprising between 55 and 71 segments with 16 pairs of elytra. The elytra are large, delicate and cover the dorsum on the anterior part of the body but not on posterior segments. The prostomium is bilobed with widely spaced triangular cephalic peaks. The lateral antennae are inserted ventrally, directly beneath the median antenna ceratophore. The neuropodium is elongate and tapering. The notochaetae are smooth and about as thick as neurochaetae. The neurochaetae have serrations in transverse rows and sharply pointed unidentate tips. Neurochaetae with bidentate tips are also absent. Ecology Tottonpolynoe symantipatharia has a commensal relationship with antipatharian and gorgonian corals.

She is the University Chair of Radiology at Montefiore and Professor of Radiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Early life and education Yee was born in Manhattan, New York along with four siblings. She attended the Bronx High School of Science and Barnard College where she majored in biology before earning her medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Following this, she completed an internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and her radiology residency at Jacobi Medical Center. Career Upon completing her medical residency, Yee completed a fellowship in abdominal imaging at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She received the Howard L. Steinbach Award for Outstanding Fellow before joining the faculty at the UCSF in 1993. As an assistant professor of radiology and Chief of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC), Yee studied colorectal cancer screening and early detection. In 2001, she led a landmark study which found that Computed Tomographic (CT) colonography (virtual colonoscopies) was just as effective at detecting clinically significant colorectal polyps for colon cancer screening compared to standard invasive colonoscopy. Her research team came to this conclusion by comparing the virtual technique to the standard colonoscopy. In recognition of her efforts, she received the 2007 Visiting Professorship Award from the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists (SGR) for achievements in Radiologic research and education and became a member of the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology. Yee continued to conduct research on this subject and in 2008 published another study as site principal investigator of a large multi-center trial which confirmed her earlier work that CT colonography was a viable alternative to coloscopy for colon cancer screening. Yee was the site principal investigator of another large-scale study evaluating 605 patients to determine whether CTCs performed without laxatives was as accurate as conventional colonoscopy. As an expert in the field, Yee was the editor and main author of the textbook Virtual Colonoscopy and a patent on Enhanced Virtual Colonoscopy. During her time as the chief of radiology at the SFVAMC and Vice Chair of radiology at UCSF, she also served as Vice Chair of the Board of the Northern California Institute for Research and Education (NCIRE). She has also served on the editorial boards of all major radiology journals including Radiology, RadioGraphics, Abdominal Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, and the Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography. Her achievements have been recognized nationally and in 2015 was appointmented president of the Society of Abdominal Radiology. In her final year at SFVAMC, Yee used 3D technology to create virtual holography CTC in an effort to advance non-invasive screening for colon cancer. In 2017, Yee was appointed a University Chair of Radiology at Montefiore Medical Centre and Professor of Radiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was later recognized by the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology as an honorary fellow, becoming the first woman to earn this title in the 30 year history of the society.
