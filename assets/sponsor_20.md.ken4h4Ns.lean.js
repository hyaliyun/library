Outside North America, it distributed films by Universal Pictures (now owned by NBCUniversal/Comcast) and Paramount Pictures (now owned by ViacomCBS, which is owned by National Amusements), CIC's partners. DreamWorks films were added to the company output in 1998, as the fledgling studio had a worldwide video distribution deal with Universal. When the distributor appointed Karl Oliver from Brooke Bond Batchelors to be its sales and marketing director in 1991, they wanted him to introduce \\"classic FMCG disciplines\\" to its marketing campaign. Oliver responded by reducing video cassette prices to and promote impulse purchasing as part of CIC Video's reformed distribution strategy. After the sudden death of CIC Video's president Roy Featherstone of an asthma attack on 17 July 1992 the distributor underwent restructuring with aid from senior Universal and Paramount employees. In 1994, Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures, enabling CIC Video to gain international distribution rights to shows from, among other networks, MTV and Nickelodeon, which came into effect in Australia in 1995 and the UK and other countries in early 1996. In 1999, CIC Video was dissolved when Universal purchased PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and reorganized its video division under the Universal name. Paramount Home Entertainment became CIC Video's successor. The last videos with the CIC label were released in the same year. Meanwhile, the distributor signed sales and distribution contracts with local market producers in Europe to increase profit and the brand name of CIC Video remained in the short term in markets where Paramount Home Entertainment were absent.  Australia  CIC Video was operated in Australia (where it was known as CIC-Taft Home Video) by the Taft- Hardie joint venture (now Southern Star Group), and also distributed some Southern Star and Hanna-Barbera product under other labels.

Teodato Ipato (also Diodato or Deusdedit; ) was Doge of Venice from 742 to 755. With his election came the restoration of the dogato, which had been defunct since the assassination of his father, Orso Ipato. Before his election he had served as magister militum in 739. Teodato was the son of Doge Orso Ipato. He was condemned to exile in 737 in the wake of his father's murder, which came perhaps as a complication of a civil conflict between Eraclea and Equilio. The office of doge was subsequently abolished in favour of a magister militum, denoting in this case a chief magistrate to be replaced yearly. The first to be installed in this role was Domenico Leoni, who at the end of his twelve-month term was replaced by Felicius Cornicola. It was under Felicius' administration that Teodato was recalled from exile.Hazlitt, p. 45 After returning home, Teodato is said to have gained the favour of the Venetian electors, and in 739, he was thus selected as Felicius Cornicola's successor. At the end of his term he was himself replaced by Jovian Ceparius, having failed to procure re-election; and Jovian, at his term's end, was succeeded by Giovanni Fabriciaco, who took office in 741. Fabriciaco's appointment would prove disastrous: some months into his term an uprising took hold, and consequently he was ousted from office, blinded, and driven into exile. Most historians put this at around 742. Teodato, said to have been complicit in Fabriciaco's downfall, was later by popular vote appointed Doge, marking the end of the interregnum which had lasted from 737‚Äì42. Under Teodato, Venice's seat of government was moved from Eraclea to Malamocco. Also during his reign came the renewal of an age-old treaty with the Lombards, first composed in the reign of Paolo Lucio Anafesto, and an earthquake which is said to have flooded parts of Venice. His reign came to an end in 755 when he was deposed and blinded at the instigation of Galla Gaulo,Hodgson, p. 64 who was subsequently elected Doge. An alternative view of Teodato's fate, as described in Hazlitt's History of the Venetian Republic, is that rather than being blinded and deposed, he was instead murdered by adherents of Galla Gaulo.Hazlitt, p. 48  Notes  Sources *Norwich, John Julius.

Literary biography Born Teresa Ann Waller in Van Nuys, California, in 1949, she lived in the Los Angeles area until the age of 14, when her family moved to northern California. In high school, she spent her lunch hours in the school library, devouring one historical novel after another. At about that same time she discovered fantasy writers T. H. White, J. R. R. Tolkien, and C. S. Lewis, and science fiction writer Andre Norton, whose combined influence would inspire her to begin creating imaginary worlds of her own. She met her husband, John Edgerton, in 1971, when she was working as a Tarot reader at a local Renaissance faire, and he was part of a Society for Creative Anachronism troupe putting on demonstrations of medieval tourney combat. They have four grown children: Gwyneth, Daisy, Megan, and John-Miles. She and her husband live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her interest in medieval society, alchemy, magic, and Celtic mythology led her to begin writing the Green Lion Trilogy, a project which was to consume the next ten years of her life. The first book of the series, Child of Saturn, was a finalist for the Compton Crook Award. It is set in Celydonn, a fictional Celtic realm whose carefully worked out tongue is, in the writer's own words, \\"not intended to represent any real-world Celtic tongue of dialect\\" but rather is \\"an intentionally fanciful combination of Welsh, Irish and pseudo-Celtic elements\\" resulting from \\"a pattern of migrations, intermarriages and inter-tribal cultural exchanges which could have taken place on Ynis Celydonn and nowhere else\\". After completing this trilogy, her interest turned from epic fantasy to the pseudo-sciences of the 18th century, which resulted in the steampunkish fantasy of manners Goblin Moon, a book which still commands an enthusiastic cult following. Other books and short stories followed. However, publication of The Queen‚Äôs Necklace ‚Äì despite good reviews ‚Äì didn't produce enough sales to satisfy her publishers, and for a time she was unable to renew her publishing contract. In 2004 she was offered the chance to relaunch under the pseudonym Madeline Howard, and has since struck out with a new trilogy, Rune of the Unmaking, with the successful first novel, The Hidden Stars. Notable themes in Edgerton's work include the struggle to maintain decency, dignity, and kindness even when faced with dire circumstances. Her heroes and heroines are often conflicted characters who chastise themselves harshly for failings that her readers easily forgive. Edgerton‚Äôs prose is richly descriptive, reflecting her love of 19th and early 20th century writers, and her desire to construct a textured and realistic secondary reality for each of her works.

Dennis Dobson, 1959) Next of Kin, also known as The Space Willies, is a science fiction comic novel by English writer Eric Frank Russell. It is the story of a military misfit who successfully conducts a one-man psychological warfare operation against an alien race, with whom humans and allied races are at war. It was published under the title Next of Kin in 1959. A novella-length version was published in Astounding Science Fiction in 1956 as \\"Plus X\\", then published in somewhat expanded form by ACE Books as The Space Willies in 1958. Plot John Leeming is every sergeant's worst nightmare -- immune to discipline and punishment, and given to random acts of defiance, such as wearing his cap backwards on parade for no particular reason. Thus when a mission to fly a prototype spaceship behind enemy lines comes up, he is the ideal candidate to fly it. The ship is untested but should be able to outrun anything else in the galaxy. It carries no arms but is an ideal spy vessel for discovering the movements of the ships of the Lathians and their allies. Since the odds of returning alive are pretty slim, it is also an ideal way of dealing with Leeming. For his part, Leeming is ready to jump at any alternative to life in barracks and the stockade. He is equipped with a survival kit designed by a top bureaucratic committee, so it contains an exquisite miniature camera that is of no conceivable use if he needs to survive on an alien world, as well as the usual inedible food. For a while the mission goes well, and Leeming relieves some of the boredom by listening in on routine ship-to-ship messages. He overhears conversations in a language that sounds exactly like English, but used to make bizarre statements, such as \\"Mayor Snorkum shall lay the cake\\", \\"What for the cake will be laid by Snorkum ?\\", \\"I shall lambast my mother!\\". Leeming starts tossing in his own comments, resulting in an aggrieved response \\"Clam shack?\\" Later, the ship malfunctions and Leeming is forced to land on an alien world, which turns out to be inhabited by the speakers of quasi-English. They are a dour, reptilian race who make ideal prison guards. On being locked up, Leeming is told by the guard \\"We shall bend Murgatroyd's socks\\" to which he can only reply \\"Dashed decent of you\\". Leeming winds up in one half of a POW camp, of which the other half is inhabited by members of another allied race. Unfortunately they have never seen a human and so do not trust him. To find a way out, he learns the alien language and tries to get the other prisoners to trust him. He begins to cultivate an imaginary friend whom he calls Eustace. He convinces the guards that Eustace can go anywhere and spy for him, and also that every human has a Eustace who can do the same. In addition, Eustaces can wreak revenge on those who harm their partners. Events help him here, in that one guard he threatens with Eustace is shot for allowing a mass escape attempt of the other prisoners. Furthermore, Leeming alleges that the Lathians, the leaders of the enemy alliance, also have invisible companions called Willies, although these are far inferior to Eustaces. He tells the aliens to ask human prisoners on other planets two questions : \\"Do the Lathians have the Willies?\\" and \\"Are the Lathians nuts?\\", a \\"nut\\", according to Leeming, being someone with an invisible companion. Leeming's captors are convinced by the responses and fear that if they start accepting human prisoners, they will have thousands of invisible Eustaces running wild across their planet, spying and causing mayhem. They immediately release Leeming and smuggle him home, at the same time withdrawing from their alliances and convincing other races to do the same. The enemy alliance collapses and the Lathians have to make peace. On arriving home, Leeming's behaviour is, if anything, even more erratic and insubordinate than ever. It is not clear if this is due to his sense of elation at having beaten his captors, or to his having suffered a nervous breakdown from the stresses he has endured. The plot has obvious similarities to E. H. Jones's The Road to En-Dor ‚Äì an account of that author's escape from the Yozgad prisoner of war camp in Turkey during World War I.

His sobriquet, Cheiro, derives from the word cheiromancy, meaning palmistry. He was a self-described clairvoyant who learned palmistry, astrology, and Chaldean numerology in India during his stay there. He was celebrated for using these forms of divination to make personal predictions for famous clients and to foresee world events. Personal life and background The son of William Warner and Margaret Thompson Warner, Cheiro was born William John Warner in the village of Rathdown, outside Dublin, Ireland. He took the name Count Louis Hamon (or Count Leigh de Hamong). As mentioned in his memoirs, Cheiro acquired his expertise in India. As a teenager, he traveled to the Bombay port of Apollo Bunder. There, he met his Guru, an Indian Chitpavan Brahmin, who took him to his village in the valley of the Konkan region of Maharashtra. Later Cheiro was permitted by Brahmans to study an ancient book that has many studies on hands; After studying thoroughly for two years, he returned to London and started his career as a palmist. Cheiro was reluctant to marry but was aware that he was destined to marry late in life. This did happen after a woman took care of him during a serious illness. A separate chapter is devoted to this matter in his memoirs. Career Cheiro had a wide following of famous European and American clients during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He read palms and told the fortunes of famous celebrities like Mark Twain, W. T. Stead, Sarah Bernhardt, Mata Hari, Oscar Wilde, Grover Cleveland, Thomas Edison, the Prince of Wales, General Kitchener, William Ewart Gladstone, and Joseph Chamberlain. He documented his sittings with these clients by asking them to sign a guest book he kept for the purpose, in which he encouraged them to comment on their experiences as subjects of his character analyses and predictions. Of the Prince of Wales, he wrote that \\"I would not be surprised if he did not give up everything, including his right to be crowned, for the woman he loved.\\" Cheiro also predicted that the Jews would return to Palestine and the country would again be called Israel. In his own autobiographical book, Cheiro's Memoirs: The Reminiscences of a Society Palmist, he included accounts of his interviews with King Edward VII, William Gladstone, Charles Stewart Parnell, Henry Morton Stanley, Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar Wilde, Professor Max Muller, Blanche Roosevelt, the Comte de Paris, Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Russell of Killowen, Robert Ingersoll, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Lillie Langtry, W. T. Stead, Richard Croker, Natalia Janotha, and other prominent people of his era. The book Titanic's Last Secrets includes a detailed account of one of Cheiro's palm readings with William Pirrie, chairman of Harland and Wolf, builders of the Titanic. Cheiro predicted that he would soon be in a fight for his life, talking about the battle surrounding the Titanic sinking. So popular was Cheiro as a \\"Society Palmist\\" that even those who were not believers in the occult had their hands read by him. The skeptical Mark Twain wrote in Cheiro's visitor's book: Other mentions in the visitors book include: \\"The study of people gifted with occult powers has interested me for several years. I have met and consulted scores.In almost ever respect I consider Cheiro the most highly gifted of all. He helps as well as astonishes.\\"- Ella Wheeler Wilcox. \\"You are wonderful. What more can I say\\"- Madame Nellie Melba. Death After some years in London, and many world travels, Cheiro moved to America. He spent his final years in Hollywood, seeing as many as twenty clients a day and doing some screenwriting before his death there in 1936 following a heart attack. His widow, the Countess Lena Hamon, said her 70-year-old husband, who had been a friend and adviser to film actors late in life, and to European aristocracy and royalty in his early career, had predicted his own death to the hour the day before he died. From Time Magazine of October 19, 1936: :Died. Count Louis Hamon (\\"Cheiro\\"), 69, celebrated oldtime palmist; after long illness; in Hollywood. Author of a book on palmistry at 13, owned an English-language newspaper in Paris, The American Register. On the night he died, said his nurse, the clock outside his room struck the hour of one thrice. Bibliography The occult books Cheiro wrote centered on fortune telling. Many of Cheiro's books on occultism and fortune telling are still in print today and are available in both English and foreign language editions. In 2006, the University of Tampa Press issued a critical new edition of his fictional work, A Study of Destiny, as the second volume of the series Insistent Visions ‚Äì a series dedicated to reprinting little-known or neglected works of supernatural fiction, science fiction, mysteries, or adventure stories from the 19th century.

Life  John Anthony Bailey was born on June 4, 1947 in Ohio, U.S. Bailey lived in San Francisco, California during the early 1970s where he attended Merritt College in Oakland and performed in numerous stage and film productions. His performances included Richard Wesley's The Black Terror, for John Cochran's Black Repertory West, J. E. Franklin's Black Girl with Adilah Barnes, work with the improvisational theatre group, The Pitschel Players, and appearances with other San Francisco Bay Area theater companies. Bailey also appeared in the Sun Ra film Space Is the Place (made in 1972 and released in 1974).  Career  Bailey is best known for the role of C.C. McNamara on the Sid and Marty Krofft children's television program Wonderbug (1976). He also appeared in two episodes of Happy Days as \\"Sticks\\", the drummer of Richie's band; M*A*S*H (1972), Good Times (1975) and in the feature film, The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977). During the 1980s, Bailey began a career in pornographic films under the pseudonym Jack Baker. In 1984, he appeared in Let Me Tell Ya 'bout White Chicks, produced and directed by Gregory Dark. His other collaborations with Dark include New Wave Hookers (1985), The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning and The Devil in Miss Jones 4: The Final Outrage (both 1986). Although his pornographic career initially had often called on him to participate in the explicit sex scenes, somewhere around the time of the \\"Miss Jones\\" movies, he had largely, for the most part, ceased performing hardcore sex on-screen, and became known as a \\"non-sex\\" actor in the business. His adult roles (particularly for the Dark Brothers) often were comedic in nature, and poked fun at racial stereotypes. According to the Internet Adult Film Database, Bailey appeared in more than 140 films and produced one movie.

Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968.K. Pollack, Arabs at War, p. 375 The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980‚Äì1981 and 1983‚Äì1987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to support the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986. The pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting.K. Pollack, p. 376 This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad.S. Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy, p. 230 This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the United States, Zaire and France with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict. Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period. In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's \\"underbelly\\", an Islamic republic modelled after his jamahiriya, that would maintain close ties with Libya, and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip; expulsion of the French from the region; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa.M. Azevedo, Roots of Violence, p. 151  Background  = Occupation of the Aouzou Strip = Libyan involvement with Chad can be said to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET).A. Clayton, Frontiersmen, p. 98 Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chad‚ÄìLibya border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies. All this changed with the Libyan coup d'√©tat of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in northern Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, A Study of Crisis, p. 84 The Aouzou Strip, highlighted in red Though initially wary of the FROLINAT, Gaddafi had come to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding.R. Brian Ferguson, The State, Identity and Violence, p. 267 On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president Fran√ßois Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians. On the day of the failed coup, Tombalbaye cut all diplomatic relations with Libya and Egypt, and invited all Libyan opposition groups to base themselves in Chad, and started laying claims to Fezzan on the grounds of \\"historical rights\\". Gaddafi's answer was to officially recognize on 17 September the FROLINAT as the sole legitimate government of Chad. In October, Chadian Foreign Minister Baba Hassan denounced Libya's \\"expansionist ideas\\" at the United Nations.G. Simons, Libya and the West, p. 56 Through French pressure on Libya and the mediation of Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic relations with Israel and is said to have secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou Strip to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian PresidentS. Nolutshungu, p. 327 and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 85J. Wright, Libya, Chad and the Central Sahara, p. 130 Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974;M. Azevedo, p. 145 in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds. Six months after the signing of the 1972 treaty, Libyan troops moved into the Strip and established an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles. A civil administration was set up, attached to Kufra, and Libyan citizenship was extended to the few thousand inhabitants of the area. From that moment, Libyan maps represented the area as part of Libya. The exact terms by which Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The existence of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient not to mention the occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993. = Expansion of the insurgency = The rapprochement was not to last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'√©tat removed Tombalbaye and replaced him with General F√©lix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, and in the same year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces. Libyan activism began generating concerns in the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). The insurgents split on the issue of Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan Hiss√®ne Habr√©. The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by Goukouni Oueddei. The latter group soon renamed itself People's Armed Forces (FAP).R. Buijtenhuijs, \\"Le FROLINAT √† l'√©preuve du pouvoir\\", p. 19 In those years, Gaddafi's support had been mostly moral, with only a limited supply of weapons. All this started changing in February 1977, when the Libyans provided Oueddei's men with hundreds of AK-47 assault rifles, dozens of RPGs, 81 and 82mm mortars and recoilless cannons. Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the Chadian Armed Forces' (FAT) strongholds of Barda√Ø and Zouar in Tibesti and of Ounianga K√©bir in Borkou. Oueddei took full control of the Tibesti with this attack after Barda√Ø, besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while Zouar was evacuated. The FAT lost 300 men, and piles of military supplies fell into the hands of the rebels.R. Buijtenhuijs, pp. 16‚Äì17 Ounianga was attacked on 20 June, but was saved by the French military advisors present there.A. Clayton, p. 99 As it had become evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya as a base for deeper involvement in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity.J. Wright, pp. 130‚Äì131 Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habr√©, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habr√© as Prime Minister.S. Macedo, Universal Jurisdiction, pp. 132‚Äì133R. Buijtenhuijs, Guerre de gu√©rilla et r√©volution en Afrique noire, p. 27 The Malloum-Habr√© accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habr√©, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the only chance to thwart Gaddafi's plans.A. G√©rard, Nimeiry face aux crises tchadiennes, p. 119  Conflict  = Libyan escalation = MiG-23 M's with empty missile rails rolling along the runway at Faya Largeau Airbase, some time in the mid-1980s The Malloum-Habr√© accord was perceived by Gaddafi as a serious threat to his influence in Chad, and he increased the level of Libyan involvement. For the first time with the active participation of Libyan ground units, Goukouni's FAP unleashed the Ibrahim Abatcha offensive on 29 January 1978 against the last outposts held by the government in northern Chad: Faya-Largeau, Fada and Ounianga K√©bir. The attacks were successful, and Oueddei and the Libyans assumed control of the BET Prefecture.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 86R. Buijtenhuijs, Guerre de gu√©rilla et r√©volution en Afrique noire, p. 26 The decisive confrontation between the Libyan-FAP forces and the Chadian regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, the capital of the BET. The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.R. Buijtenhuijs, \\"Le FROLINAT √† l'√©preuve du pouvoir\\", p. 18 Oueddei captured about 2,500 prisoners in 1977 and 1978; as a result, the Chadian Armed Forces lost at least 20% of its manpower. In particular, the National and Nomadic Guard (GNN) was decimated by the fall of Fada and Faya.Libya-Sudan-Chad Triangle, p. 32 Oueddei used these victories to strengthen his position in the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.R. Buijtenhuijs, \\"Le FROLINAT √† l'√©preuve du pouvoir\\", p. 21 Malloum's reaction to the Goukouni‚ÄìGaddafi offensive was to sever diplomatic relations with Libya on 6 February and bring before the UN Security Council the issue of Libyan involvement. He raised again the question of Libya's occupation of the Aouzou Strip; on 19 February, however, after the fall of Faya-Largeau, Malloum was forced to accept a ceasefire and withdraw the protest. Gaddafi halted the advance of Oueddei because of pressure from France, then an important supplier of Libya's weapons. Malloum and Gaddafi restored diplomatic relations on 24 February in Sabha, Libya, where an international peace conference was held which included as mediators Niger's President, Seyni Kountch√©, and Sudan's Vice-President, Abu al-Gasim Mohamed Ibrahim. Under severe pressure from France, Sudan and Zaire,M. Azevedo, p. 146 Malloum was forced to sign the Benghazi Accord, which recognized the FROLINAT and agreed on a new ceasefire, on 27 March. The agreement called for the creation of a joint Libya‚ÄìNiger military committee tasked with implementation; through this committee, Chad legitimized Libyan intervention in its territory. The accord also contained a condition dear to Libya: the termination of all French military presence in Chad. The stillborn accord was for Gaddafi nothing more than a strategy to strengthen his prot√©g√© Oueddei; it also weakened considerably Malloum's prestige among southern Chadians, who saw his concessions as a proof of his weak leadership. On 15 April, only a few days after signing the ceasefire, Oueddei left Faya-Largeau, leaving there a Libyan garrison of 800 men. Relying on Libyan armor and air power, Goukouni's forces conquered a small FAT garrison and turned towards N'Djamena. Against Oueddei stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after Oueddei first offensives, Malloum had asked for a French military return in Chad, but President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing was at first reluctant to commit himself before the 1978 legislative elections; also, France was afraid of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya. However, the rapid deterioration of the situation in Chad resolved the President on 20 February 1978 to start Op√©ration Tacaud, which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.J. de L√©spin√¥is, \\"L'emploi de la force aeri√©nne au Tchad\\", pp. 70‚Äì71 The decisive battle took place at Ati, a town 430 kilometres northeast of N'Djamena. The town's garrison of 1,500 soldiers was attacked on 19 May by the FROLINAT insurgents, equipped with artillery and modern weapons. The garrison was relieved by the arrival of a Chadian task force supported by armor and, more importantly, of the French Foreign Legion and the 3rd Regiment of Marine Infantry. In a two-day battle, the FROLINAT was repelled with heavy losses, a victory that was confirmed in June by another engagement at Djedaa. The FROLINAT admitted defeat and fled north, having lost 2,000 men and left the \\"ultramodern equipment\\" they carried on the ground. Of key importance in these battles was the complete air superiority the French could count on, as the Libyan Air Force pilots refused to fight them.M. Pollack, pp. 376‚Äì377H. Simpson, The Paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion, p. 55 = Libyan difficulties = Only a few months after the failed offensive against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.M. Brandily, \\"Le Tchad face nord\\", p. 59N. Mouric, \\"La politique tchadienne de la France\\", p. 99 The reasons for the clash between Gaddafi and Goukouni were both ethnic and political. The FROLINAT was divided between Arabs, like Acyl, and Toubous, like Goukouni and Habr√©. These ethnic divisions also reflected a different attitude towards Gaddafi and his Green Book. In particular, Goukouni and his men had shown themselves reluctant to follow Gaddafi's solicitations to make The Green Book the official policy of the FROLINAT, and had first tried to take time, postponing the question until the complete reunification of the movement. When the unification was accomplished, and Gaddafi pressed again for the adoption of The Green Book, the dissensions in the Revolution's Council became manifest, with many proclaiming their loyalty to the movement's original platform approved in 1966 when Ibrahim Abatcha was made first secretary-general, while others, including Acyl, fully embraced the Colonel's ideas.M. Brandily, pp. 58‚Äì61 In N'Djamena, the simultaneous presence of two armies‚ÄîPrime Minister Habr√©'s FAN and President Malloum's FAT‚Äîset the stage for the battle of N'Djamena, which was to bring about the collapse of the State and the ascent to power of the Northern elite. A minor incident escalated on 12 February 1979 into heavy fighting between Habr√© and Malloum's forces, and the battle intensified on 19 February when Goukouni's men entered in the capital to fight alongside Habr√©. By 16 March, when the first international peace conference took place, an estimated 2,000‚Äì5,000 people had been killed and 60,000‚Äì70,000 forced to flee. The greatly diminished Chadian army left the capital in the rebels' hands and reorganized itself in the south under the leadership of Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©. During the battle, the French garrison stood passively by, even helping Habr√© in certain circumstances, as when they demanded that the Chadian Air Force stop its bombings.M. Azevedo, pp. 104‚Äì105, 119, 135 An international peace conference was held in Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habr√©, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni.M. Azevedo, p. 106 This was a result of Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habr√© to share power;M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 88 the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi.N. Mouric, p. 100 A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.K. Pollack, p. 377 Despite signing the Kano Accord,T. Mays, Africa's First Peacekeeping operation, p. 43 Libya was incensed that the GUNT did not include any of the leaders of the Volcan Army and had not recognized Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.T. Mays, p. 39 The fighting with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria of an economic boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in Lagos in August, to which all eleven factions present in Chad participated. A new accord was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and be replaced by a multinational African peace force.T. Mays, pp. 45‚Äì46 The new GUNT took office in November, with Goukouni President, Kamougu√© Vice-President, Habr√© Defence MinisterS. Nolutshungu, p. 133 and Acyl Foreign Minister.M. Azevedo, p. 147 Despite the presence of Habr√©, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro- Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.J. Wright, p. 131 = Libyan intervention = From the start, Habr√© isolated himself from the other members of the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habr√©'s hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habr√© and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habr√© and Goukouni. Clashes in the capital between Habr√©'s FAN and pro-Libyan groups became progressively more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000‚Äì1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.S. Nolutshungu, p. 135M. Azevedo, p. 108 While the FAN was supplied economically and militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougu√©'s FAT and Acyl's CDR shortly after the beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, and a threat against one constituted a threat against the other.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 89 Beginning in October, Libyan troops, led by Khalifa Haftar and Ahmed Oun, airlifted to the Aouzou Strip operated in conjunction with Goukouni's forces to reoccupy Faya. The city was then used as an assembly point for tanks, artillery and armored vehicles that moved south against the capital of N'Djamena.H. Metz, Libya, p. 261 An attack started on 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and reportedly coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought the fall of the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.J. Wright, p. 132 While forced into exile and with his forces confined to the frontier zones of Darfur, Habr√© remained defiant. On 31 December he announced in Dakar he would resume fighting as a guerrilla against the GUNT. = Libyan withdrawal = On 6 January 1981, a joint communiqu√© was issued in Tripoli by Gaddafi and Goukouni that Libya and Chad had decided \\"to work to achieve full unity between the two countries\\". The merger plan caused strong adverse reaction in Africa, and was immediately condemned by France, which on 11 January offered to strengthen its garrisons in friendly African states and on 15 January placed its Mediterranean fleet on alert. Libya answered by threatening to impose an oil embargo, while France threatened to react if Libya attacked another bordering country. The accord was also opposed by all GUNT ministers present with Goukouni at Tripoli, with the exception of Acyl.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 89‚Äì90 Most observers believe that the reasons behind Goukouni's accepting the accord may be found in a mix of threats, intense pressure and the financial help promised by Gaddafi. Just before his visit to the Libyan capital, Goukouni had sent two of his commanders to Libya for consultations; at Tripoli, Goukouni learned from Gaddafi that they had been assassinated by \\"Libyan dissidents\\", and that if Goukouni did not want to risk losing Libyan favour and lose power, he should accept the merger plan.M. Azevedo, pp. 147‚Äì148 The level of opposition caused Gaddafi and Goukouni to downplay the importance of the communiqu√©, speaking of a \\"union\\" of peoples, and not of states, and as a \\"first step\\" towards closer collaboration. But the damage had been done, and the joint communiqu√© badly weakened Goukouni's prestige as a nationalist and a statesman. In response to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept the decisions of the OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habr√©'s FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US Central Intelligence Agency.S. Nolutshungu, p. 156 Relations between Goukouni and Gaddafi started deteriorating. Libyan troops were stationed in various points of northern and central Chad, in numbers that had reached about 14,000 troops by January‚ÄìFebruary 1981. These forces created considerable annoyance in the GUNT by supporting Acyl's faction in its disputes with the other militias, including the clashes held in late April with Goukouni's FAP. There were also attempts to Libyanize the local population, which made many conclude that \\"unification\\" for Libya meant Arabization and the imposition of Libyan political culture, in particular of The Green Book.S. Nolutshungu, p. 153M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 90M. Azevedo, p. 148 Amid fighting in October between Gaddafi's Islamic Legionnaires and Goukouni's troops, and rumors that Acyl was planning a coup d'√©tat to assume the leadership of the GUNT, Goukouni demanded on 29 October the complete and unequivocal withdrawal of Libyan forces from Chadian territory, which, beginning with the capital, was to be completed by 31 December. The Libyans were to be replaced by an OAU Inter-African Force (IAF). Gaddafi complied, and by 16 November all Libyan forces had left Chad, redeploying in the Aouzou Strip. Libya's prompt retreat took many observers by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire to host the OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, it would have been difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 154‚Äì155 = Habr√© takes N'Djamena = The first IAF component to arrive in Chad were the Zairean paratroopers; they were followed by Nigerian and Senegalese forces, bringing the IAF to 3,275 men. Before the peace-keeping force was fully deployed, Habr√© had already taken advantage of Libya's withdrawal, and made massive inroads in eastern Chad, including the important city of Ab√©ch√©, that fell on 19 November.S. Nolutshungu, p. 164 Next to fall was Oum Hadjer in early January 1982, only from Ati, the last major town before the capital. The GUNT was saved for the moment by the IAF, the only credible military force confronting Habr√©, which prevented the FAN from taking Ati.T. Mays, pp. 134‚Äì135 In the light of Habr√©'s offensive, the OAU requested that the GUNT open reconciliation talks with Habr√©, a demand that was angrily refused by Goukouni;S. Nolutshungu, p. 165 later he was to say: In May 1982, the FAN started a final offensive, passing unhindered by the peacekeepers in Ati and Mongo. Goukouni, increasingly angered with the IAF's refusal to fight Habr√©, made an attempt to restore his relations with Libya, and reached Tripoli on 23 May. Gaddafi, however, burned by his experience the previous year, proclaimed Libya neutral in the civil war.S. Nolutshungu, p. 168 The GUNT forces made a last stand at Massaguet, north of capital, but were defeated by the FAN on 5 June after a hard battle. Two days later Habr√© entered N'Djamena unopposed, making him the de facto leader of Chad, while Goukouni fled the country, seeking sanctuary in Cameroon.K. Pollack, p. 382T. Mays, p. 99 After occupying the capital, Habr√© consolidated power by occupying the rest of the country. In barely six weeks, he conquered southern Chad, destroying the FAT, Kamougu√©'s militia; Kamougu√©'s hopes for Libyan help failed to materialize. The rest of the country was conquered, with the exception of the Tibesti.S.Nolutshungu, p. 186 = GUNT offensive = Since Gaddafi had kept mostly aloof in the months prior to the fall of N'Djamena, Habr√© hoped to reach an understanding with Libya, possibly through an accord with Acyl, who appeared receptive to dialogue. But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by Acheikh ibn Oumar, and the CDR was antagonized by Habr√©'s eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.S.Nolutshungu, p. 185 Therefore, it was with Libyan support that Goukouni reassembled the GUNT, creating in October a National Peace Government in the Tibesti town of Barda√Ø and claiming itself the legitimate government by the terms of the Lagos Accord. For the impending fight, Goukouni could count on 3,000‚Äì4,000 men taken from several militias, later merged in an Arm√©e Nationale de Lib√©ration (ANL) under the command of a Southerner, Negue Djogo.S. Nolutshungu, p. 188M. Azevedo, p. 110, 139 Before Gaddafi could throw his full weight behind Goukouni, Habr√© attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti, but was repelled both in December 1982 and in January 1983. The following months saw the clashes intensify in the North, while talks, including visits in March between Tripoli and N'Djamena, broke down. On 17 March, Habr√© brought the conflict before the UN, asking for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to consider Libya's \\"aggression and occupation\\" of Chadian territory.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 91 Gaddafi was ready now for an offensive. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invaded Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba, and Ab√©ch√©, assuming control of the main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, and most of these were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair. The international community, in particular France and the US, reacted adversely to the Libyan-backed offensive. On the same day as the fall of Faya, French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson warned Libya that France would \\"not remain indifferent\\" to a new Libyan involvement in Chad, and on 11 July the French government accused again Libya of direct military support to the rebels. French arms shipments were resumed on 27 June, and on 3 July a first contingent of 250 Zaireans arrived to strengthen Habr√©; the United States announced in July military and food aid for 10 million dollars. Gaddafi suffered also a diplomatic setback from the OAU, that at the meeting held in June officially recognized Habr√©'s government and asked for all foreign troops to leave Chad.M. Azevedo, p. 159 Supplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habr√© rapidly reorganized his forces (now called Chadian National Armed Forces, or FANT). FANT marched north to confront the GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Ab√©ch√©. Habr√© crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake in rapid succession Ab√©ch√©, Biltine, Fada and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, threatening to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip. = French intervention = GUNT-controlled area in Chad until 1986/87 (light green), \\"red line\\" on the 15th and 16th parallels (1983 and 1984) and Libyan-occupied Aouzou Strip (dark green) A map of Chad including the 15th parallel (the Red Line) where the French separated government and rebel forces Feeling that a complete destruction of the GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habr√© would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.K. Pollack, pp. 382‚Äì383 Since the day after the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was subjected to a sustained air bombardment, using Su-22 and Mirage F-1s from the Aouzou air base, along with Tu-22 bombers from Sabha. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, Kufra and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter- range transport planes to the area of conflict. The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their traditional role of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which could count on 3,000‚Äì4,000 men on this occasion.K. Pollack, p. 383 The GUNT-Libyan alliance invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habr√© had entrenched himself with about 5,000 troops. Battered by multiple rocket launcher (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT troops on the ground. Habr√© escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans. This was to prove a tactical blunder, as the new Libyan intervention had alarmed France. Habr√© issued a fresh plea for French military assistance on 6 August.J. Jessup, An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict, p. 116 France, also due to American and African pressures, announced on 6 August the return of French troops in Chad as part of Operation Manta, meant to stop the GUNT-Libyan advance and more generally weaken Gaddafi's influence in the internal affairs of Chad. Three days later several hundred French troops were dispatched to N'Djamena from the Central African Republic, later brought to 2,700, with several squadrons of Jaguar fighter-bombers. This made it the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by the French in Africa outside of the Algerian War.S. Nolutshungu, p. 189M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 91‚Äì92M. Azevedo, p. 139 The French government then defined a limit (the so-called Red Line), along the 15th parallel, extending from Mao to Ab√©ch√©, and warned that they would not tolerate any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on their side of the line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habr√© retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line. A lull ensued, during which November talks sponsored by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt at the beginning of 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 92S. Nolutshungu, p. 191M. Azevedo, p. 110 = French withdrawal = To put an end to the deadlock, Gaddafi proposed on 30 April a mutual withdrawal of both the French and Libyan forces in Chad. French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand showed himself receptive to the offer, and on 17 September the two leaders publicly announced that the mutual withdrawal would start on 25 September, and be completed by 10 November. The accord was at first hailed by the media as proof of Mitterrand's diplomatic skill and a decisive progress towards the solution of the Chadian crisis;M. Azevedo, pp. 139‚Äì140 it also demonstrated Mitterrand's intent of following a foreign policy independent from both the US and the Chadian government regarding Libya and Chad. While France respected the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad. When this became evident, it embarrassed the French and caused recriminations between the French and Chadian governments.M. Azevedo, p. 140 On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on Crete, under the auspices of the Greek prime minister Papandreou. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted that this was not true. However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.G.L. Simons, p. 293 According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 bilateral Franco-Libyan agreement may have provided Gaddafi with an excellent opportunity to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habr√© into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 202‚Äì203 = New French intervention = During the period between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habr√© greatly strengthened his position thanks to staunch US support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. Also decisive was the increasing factional bickering that started plaguing the GUNT since 1984, centered around the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over the organization's leadership.S.Nolutshungu, pp. 191‚Äì192, 210 In this period, Gaddafi expanded his control over northern Chad, building new roads and erecting a major new airbase, Ouadi Doum, meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the Aouzou Strip. He also brought in considerable reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces in the country to 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft.K. Pollack, pp. 384‚Äì385 While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habr√© government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.S. Nolutshungu, p. 212 These desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT provided a cover of legitimacy to Libya's presence in Chad. To put a halt to these and reunite the GUNT, a major offensive was launched on the Red Line with the goal of taking N'Djamena. The attack, started on 10 February 1986, involved 5,000 Libyan and 5,000 GUNT troops, and concentrated on the FANT outposts of Kouba Olanga, Kalait and Oum Chalouba. The campaign ended in disaster for Gaddafi, when a FANT counteroffensive on 13 February using the new equipment obtained from the French forced the attackers to withdraw and reorganize.K. Pollack, p. 389 Most important was French reaction to the attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant to start a new risky and costly expedition to save Habr√©; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Op√©ration Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 93S. Nolutshungu, pp. 212‚Äì213 = Tibesti War = The defeats suffered in February and March accelerated the disintegration of the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the People's Republic of Congo, Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougu√©, followed by the First Army and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habr√©.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 213‚Äì214 To reestablish their supply lines and retake the towns of Barda√Ø, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also through the use of napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habr√©, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 214‚Äì216K. Pollack, p. 390 While militarily Habr√© was only partly successful in his attempt to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity that had never been seen before in Chad.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 215‚Äì216, 245 = Toyota War = At the opening of 1987, the last year of the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, numbering 8,000 troops and 300 tanks. However, it had lost the key support of its Chadian allies, who had generally provided reconnaissance and acted as assault infantry. Without them the Libyan garrisons resembled isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian desert. On the other side, the FANT was greatly strengthened, now having 10,000 highly motivated troops, provided with fast-moving and sand-adapted Toyota trucks equipped with MILAN anti-tank missiles. These trucks gave the name \\"Toyota War\\" to the last phase of the conflict.M. Azevedo, pp. 149‚Äì150K. Pollack, p. 391, 398S. Nolutshungu, pp. 218‚Äì219 Habr√© started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of northern Chad with a successful attack on the well- defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against the Libyan army the Chadian commander Hassan Djamous conducted a series of swift pincer movements, enveloping the Libyan positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the battles of B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.K. Pollack, pp. 391‚Äì394 This in turn endangered Libyan control over the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell in August to the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habr√© readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra. This attack was part of a plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.K. Pollack, pp. 395‚Äì396 The projected attack on Aouzou never took place, as the dimensions of the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 222‚Äì223K. Pollack, p. 397  Aftermath  While there were many violations of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave the door open for a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 223‚Äì224 Steadily, relations among the two countries improved, with Gaddafi giving signs that he wanted to normalize relations with the Chadian government, to the point of recognizing that the war had been an error. In May 1988, the Libyan leader declared he would recognize Habr√© as the legitimate president of Chad \\"as a gift to Africa\\"; this led on 3 October to the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. The following year, on 31 August 1989, Chadian and Libyan representatives met in Algiers to negotiate the Framework Agreement on the Peaceful Settlement of the Territorial Dispute, by which Gaddafi agreed to discuss with Habr√© the Aouzou Strip and to bring the issue to the ICJ for a binding ruling if bilateral talks failed. After a year of inconclusive talks, the sides submitted the dispute to the ICJ in September 1990.G. Simons, p. 58, 60S. Nolutshungu, p. 227M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 95 Chadian-Libyan relations further improved when Libyan-supported Idriss D√©by unseated Habr√© on 2 December. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new government, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels. Regarding the Aouzou Strip, however, D√©by followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.M. Azevedo, p. 150 The Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.G. Simons, p. 78 Muammar Gaddafi was angered by the devastating counter-attack on Libya and the ensuing defeat at the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra. Forced to accede to a ceasefire, the defeat ended his expansionist projects toward Chad and his dreams of African and Arab dominance. Given the French intervention on behalf of Chad and U.S. supply of satellite intelligence to FANT during the battle of Maaten al-Sarra, Gaddafi blamed Libya's defeat on French and U.S. \\"aggression against Libya\\".

He is best known for his illusory veiled depictions of women where the contours of their face and body beneath the veil are discernible. Born in Venice, Corradini spent much of his career as a migrant artist traveling to locations across Europe including Dresden, Prague, and Saint Petersburg to complete commissions. He spent over a decade in Vienna where he was court sculptor for Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. After a brief stint in Rome, he died in Naples.  Biography  =Early life= Much of the information on Corradini's early life is contradictory, including his date of birth. According to recent scholarship, he was the son of Gerolamo Corradini, a professional veler (packer of sails for ships), and his wife Barbara, and born in the parish of SS. Vito and Modesto. His family was modest. Corradini was apprenticed to the sculptor Antonio Tarsia (1663 - ca 1739), for whom he worked probably for four or five years starting at the age of fourteen or fifteen (this was the norm at the time). He later became Tarsia's son-in-law. =Early career= Corradini seems to have come into his own as a sculptor around 1709. That year he was employed on work for the fa√ßade of the church of San Stae in Venice. Two years later, in 1711, he was recorded as having been enrolled in the Arte dei Tagliapietra as one of the sculptors. By 1713 he had finally set up his own workshop and was working on the state of St. Anastasia in Zara for the church of San Donato. Monument to Johann Matthias Graf von der Schulenburg, Marshall of the Venetian forces, for the island of Corfu Corradini's commissions for the next several years came from patrons all over Eastern Europe. In 1716-17, he completed eighteen busts and two statues for the summer garden of the Russian czar Peter the Great in St. Petersburg, and the first of his famous veiled women; he would complete two more in the city in 1722. Sometime in 1718 or 1719 he was commissioned to execute a monument to Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, Marshal of the Venetian forces for the defence of island of Corfu. In 1718 he completed an altar for the Cathedral of Rovigo, and in 1720 he was paid for a signed altar dedicated to the Blessed Hemma, installed in the crypt. Corradini completed the outdoor marble statuary group, Nessus and Deianira (1718‚Äì1723), for the Grosser Garten in Dresden. The Apollo Flaying Marsyas and Zephyrus and Flora (1723-1728) are two life-sized marble sculptures originally commissioned by the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, Augustus the Strong for the gardens of the H√∂llandisches Palais in Dresden (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). It was also at this time that Corradini married Maria Tarsia. In 1723, Corradini reputedly became the first person to legally separate the art of sculptors from the profession of stonemasons, forming part of a college that was established in 1724. He was faced with the task of guiding the new artistic profession through its infancy. In 1725-26 he was appointed curator of the laws of the institution and became its prior in 1727. In the mid-1720s Corradini was awarded a number of commissions in Italy. He completed a number of sculptures for the Manin monument in the Cathedral of Udine and the church of San Giacomo di Udine and the altar of the Blessed Sacrament in the cathedral of Este (1722‚Äì1725), which was his work entirely. From 1724-1728 he worked in Venice on the restoration of the stairway and the sculptures of the Doge's Palace and the facade of the clock tower in the Piazza San Marco. After his wax model was chosen by the Signoria, between 1719-1729 Corradini supervised the reconstruction of the bucintoro and completed a few wood carvings for it. =Vienna= Emperor Charles VI as \\"Hercules Musarum\\" (1735) in the Austrian National Library In 1729-30, Corradini moved to Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs, where he was named court sculptor in 1733 and awarded a salary of 1700 florins a year and a housing allowance of 500 florins. He would be based there through the early 1740s. Emperor Charles VI entrusted him with the realization of the Bundesladendenkmal, or monument of the Ark of the Covenant, in Gy≈ër, in what is now northwestern Hungary, and in 1735 he worked after a drawing of Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach on a modelleto for tomb of St. Johann Nepomuk in Prague, executed by the silversmith Johann Joseph W√ºrth in St. Vitus Cathedral of the Prague Castle. Corradini completed a large number of works in Vienna itself during these years. Charles VI employed him in the decoration of the Josephbrunnen and, later, Corradini sculpted four figures for the two side altars below the dome of the Karlskirche and designed and supervised the construction of a wooden theater for animal fights called the Hetztheater. In 1736, together with Antonio Galli Bibbiena, he was named court designer for the bullfights that were held there, and on 14 April 1738 an imperial decree appointed Galli Bibbiena, Corradini, and Antonio Lopez jointly to the post of managers of the theater, which was used until 1749. The Vestal Virgin Tuccia (1743) in the Palazzo Barberini, Rome =Rome= On the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740 and his wife in 1741, and the death of Fischer von Erlach in 1742, Georg Raphael Donner became the most prominent sculptor in Vienna. Corradini entered a period of crisis. In 1740 he briefly visited Rome, then in late 1742 he returned first to Venice and then to Rome, where shared room and board with Giovanni Battista Piranesi, even though Empress Maria Theresa reconfirmed him as court sculptor. On 23 January 1743 Corradini asked permission to stay in Rome permanently with the option of returning to Vienna. In Rome, he devoted himself to sculpting the Vestal Virgin Tuccia, achieved without a commission from any patron (it remained unsold), and was involved in the problem of the restoration of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Corradini designed eight models of colossal statues with which it was proposed to place at the foot of the drum of the dome make it more resistant. He also sculpted a bust of Pope Benedict XIV and other minor works. =Naples= Corradini's Veiled Christ terracotta bozzetto in the Certosa di San Martino. Corrodini died before the full statue could be started, and Giuseppe Sammartino's completed marble is exhibited in the Cappella Sansevero in Naples. In 1744 Corradini moved to Naples to oversee the sculptural renovation of the Sansevero Chapel (Capella Sansevero de' Sangri or Pietatella) at the request of Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero VII. Corradini's work on the chapel is a very complex and intricate decoration of statues, pedestals, altar frontals, round and bas-reliefs, for which he prepared 36 bozzetti in clay. In 1750, he completed Veiled Truth (also called Modesty or Chastity), a tomb monument dedicated to Cecilia Gaetani dell'Aquila d'Aragona, mother of Raimondo di Sangro. Not only is it a technically inspired work, but the conceit of modesty shielded by the flimsiest of veils creates an alluring but ironic tension, perhaps one somewhat unmerited for a chapel funerary monument, but one that does compel remembrance. Corradini died suddenly on 12 August 1752 in Naples. He was buried there in the parish church of Santa Maria della Rotonda on the same day. Because the work in Sansevero Chapel was incomplete, Raimondo di Sangro commissioned Francesco Queirolo to oversee the remaining work based on Corradini's bozzetti. Starting from a bozzetto by Corradini that is now preserved in the Certosa di San Martino, another artist working on the project Giuseppe Sanmartino sculpted the Christ Veiled under a Shroud using the same artifice of \\"veiled\\" marble.

Libya and Sudan share an isolated border along a corner of northwestern Sudan that neither government has ever fully controlled. This state of affairs left open the possibility for a variety of real and perceived activities in the region that caused Khartoum to suspect that Libya periodically acted against its interests. Conflict between Libya and Sudan has occurred intermittently since relations between the two countries began to deteriorate in 1972. Between 1967 and 1971 Libya‚ÄìSudan relations had been based on a positive foreign policy relationship with both nations favoring solidarity with other Arab countries. However, during the early 1970s President Gaafar Nimeiry of Sudan began to pursue a foreign policy strategy which aligned Sudan with Western powers. Sudan's western focused policy conflicted with Libyan interests. This new Sudanese national interest would weaken relations between Sudan and Libya throughout the 1970s. Under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi Libya continued to pursue foreign policy directed along ideological and pragmatic lines. This resulted in several instances of conflict between the two nations between 1972 and 1976. In 1976 Sudan charged that Libya was involved in a terrorist plot against its government. This led to a severance of relations between the nations. In the late 1970s and 1980s Sudanese and Libyan foreign policy clashed over several regional conflicts. These included the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, the Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian War and Libyan support for Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. In these cases Libya's conflict with Sudan resulted from Gaddafi's regional goals of pan-Arabism and was heavily influenced by relations with Egypt.George Joffe, ‚ÄúLibya‚Äôs Saharan Destiny,‚Äù The Journal of North African Studies, 10, no. 3‚Äì4 (2005) The Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict in particular influenced the foreign policy of several African countries towards Libya. Pro-Libyan supporters were set against an anti-Libyan side which included Sudan and Egypt.Hussein Solomon and Gerrie Swart, ‚ÄúLibya‚Äôs Foreign Policy In Flux,‚Äù African Affairs, 104, no. 416, (2005) Some sub- Saharan countries, such as Zaire, supported the anti-Libyan forces in Chad out of fear of a Libyan expansion.Asteris Huliaras ,‚ÄúQadhafi's comeback: Libya and sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s‚Äù, African Affairs 100, (2001) In 1986 Libya assisted the Mahdi government under Sadiq al-Mahdi to assume power in Sudan, resuming relations between the two nations.Mary-Jane Deeb, Libya‚Äôs Foreign Policy in North Africa, Westview Press: United States After this point both nations employed markedly different foreign policy strategies. Sudan adopted a non-aligned course, trying to obtain western aid while building better relationships with Arab states. This included cooperative ties with Libya. Libya began to pursue stronger regional connections, with Gaddafi attempting to increase his influence in the African continent . This changed the nature of relations between the two nations. Events In May 1969, Gaafar Nimeiry managed a successful coup d'√©tat in Sudan. Later that same year, Muammar Gaddafi rose to power through a coup d'√©tat in Libya. He initially tried to strengthen the traditional ties with Sudan and Egypt, so much so that he proposed a federation with the individual states during his first two years in power. His policy and ideology were influenced by Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, especially his anti-Soviet, anti-Western and Arab nationalist sentiments. Their relationship was very influential until Nasser died in September 1970. In the early 1970s Sudan's internal divisions, especially in the southern region, began to play a larger role in Sudanese foreign policy. Consequently, Sudanese relations with Libya became heavily dictated by the war in southern Sudan. In August 1971, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi helped reverse a communist coup against Sudanese President Nimeiry by diverting a British airliner carrying one of the coup's leaders and handing him over to Nimeiry to be hanged.John K. Cooley. ‚ÄúThe Libyan Menace,‚Äù Foreign Policy, No. 42. (Spring, 1981) Libya turned over two of the top communist plotters to the Sudanese authorities, who executed them shortly afterward. However, a year later Sudan accused Libya of involvement in three successive coup attempts and severed diplomatic relations. ‚ÄúOne of the main features of Libya‚Äôs policy towards Africa has been its sheer volatility. In Sudan, Libya initially supported President Jaafar Nimeiry against unsuccessful leftist coup attempted in 1971; however, in 1976 the Gaddafi regime backed a coup attempt against Nimeiry that left the Sudanese leader shaken and in-secure.‚Äù. Subsequent to Libya's shaky alliance with the Nimeiry regime and Gaddafi's attempt to replace it in 1976, Sudan sought out Egyptian protection to Libya's discomfort. Relations between Libya and Sudan were in many respects a consequence of relations with Egypt. In particular, the Libya-Egypt conflict in 1977 made relations between Sudan and Libya more tense. Sudan backed Egypt in this conflict and opposed Libyan military action. During the fall of 1977, Nimeiry and Sudanese opposition leaders began attempts at reconciliation. Subsequently, starting in February 1978, Libya and Sudan agreed to resume relations. However, relations soon become strained after Gaddafi condemned Sudanese support for President Anwar Sadat of Egypt who signed the September 1978 Camp David Accords. This difference of political and ideological position toward the situation in Israel, gave Gaddafi the encouragement to support plots against the Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat and Nimeiry.Oye Ogunbadejo. ‚ÄúQaddafi and Africa‚Äôs International Relations,‚Äù The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Mar., 1986) Between 1978 and 1980 Gaddafi's Islamic Legion of Arab and African ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù trained in Libyan guerrilla camps. They supported the factional fighting in Chad and assassinated political leaders in Chad who contested Libya's interference. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Qaddafi employed assassins to eradicate his enemies in Sudan, Niger, Senegal and the Gambia. It is also alleged that his assassins unsuccessfully attempted to kill Hermann Eilts, former U.S. ambassador to Egypt. Libya's foreign policy in the area became apparent when in 1979, Libyan forces unsuccessfully invaded Chad, marking the beginning of the Chadian-Libyan conflict. The Chadian affair crystallized African attitudes toward Libya. Sudan's pro-Chadian stance during the conflict, would mark a significant point in the relations between Sudan and Libya. When interviewed by a French press agency in late 1981, President Gaafar Nimeiry called for Gaddafi's death by whatever means possible, \\"even if it means drowning him in the sea or throwing him from an aeroplane.\\" In the same interview, Nimeiry noted that his military was working with Egypt to formulate a plan to destroy Gaddafi's \\"subversive\\" influence.\\"Kadhafi Must Die\\". The Liberian Inaugural 1981-10-14: 8. Gaddafi, who has determined Libya's foreign policy since 1969, has consistently been a proponent of Arab unity, the advancement of Islam, the Palestinian cause and anti-Western sentiments. He has also supported the elimination of Israel. Hence, Gaddafi's antagonism towards Egypt was a response to Sadat's push for a separate peace with Israel. As an additional foreign policy point, Libyan actions in the region often signified strong expansionist aims. This provides the context for understanding how, in January 1981 Radio Tripoli announced the intended merger of Libya and Chad, after Gaddafi said that Chad was part of Libya's ‚Äúvital living space.‚Äù This announcement alarmed neighboring African states including Sudan. They had already suffered from Gaddafi's participation in trying to disrupt the governments of Sudan, Egypt and Tunisia through coups and assassinations after failed attempts at unification. By the end of January 1981, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) formally condemned Libya's intentions for unification with Chad and asked Gaddafi to remove his troops from Chad immediately. Gaddafi's resentment of Western influence in the region becomes apparent when in 1981 Chester Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs announced that the US was willing to funnel military aid to any of Gaddafi's neighbors who saw the problem as they saw it. This provided Sudan another avenue to obtain US foreign aid. Sudan received $250 million in economic and military aid in 1982, and more than $200 million in 1983 from the United States. In 1983, six years after Nimeiry and Sudanese opposition leaders began attempts at reconciliation, opposition from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and its military wing, the Sudan People's Liberation Army emerged against Nimeiry's northern focused policies. During this time, Libya's cooperative foreign policy towards Sudan had changed drastically since the early 1970s. While opposition to Nimeiry was mounting, Gaddafi provided financial and material support to these opposition groups and other anti-Nimeiry rebel groups and organizations, including Anyanya II and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA). While Gaddafi's foreign policy has been imbued with controversy and surprises, (a prime example relates to why Gaddafi, an Arab nationalist supported Ethiopia, a primarily Christian African country, against Sudan (under Nimeiry), an Arab country with a Muslim majority) Libya's support of anti-Nimeiry groups is understandable within the context of Libya's anti-western foreign policy and Nimeiry's support for the Camp David Accords. Nimeiry prevailed against the 1983 Libyan backed opposition but relations between the two countries continued to suffer when in March 1984, Nimeiry claimed that a Libyan Air Force Plane, a Soviet-built Tupolev TU-22 bomber, based at an airfield in the Al Kufra oasis in south-east Libya, had killed five people in an air raid on Omdurman. In reaction to the numerous coups in the region, in 1985, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was formed when all unions and political parties except the NIF signed the ‚ÄúCharter of the National Alliance‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCharter to Protect Democracy‚Äù in order to incite civil disobedience against future coups.Robert O. Collins. ‚ÄúAfricans, Arabs, and Islamists: From the Conference Tables to the Battlefields in Sudan,‚Äù African Studies Review, Vol. 42, No. 2 (Sep., 1999) Following this, on 6 April 1985, a group of military officers, led by Lieutenant General Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab, overthrew Nimeiry. Following Nimeiry's fall in 1985, Gaddafi immediately abandoned military support for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and provided his full support to Nimeiri's former Muslim opponents in the North, namely Sadiq al-Mahdi‚Äôs Umma Party. On April 9, 1985 Lieutenant General Dhahab ordered the formation of a fifteen-man Transitional Military Council (TMC) to rule Sudan. The TMC suspended the constitution; dissolved the SSU, the secret police, and the parliament and region assemblies dismissed regional governors and their minister; and released hundreds of political detainees from Kober prison. In July 1985, Libyan-Sudanese relations once again fluctuated, this time becoming stronger after a military protocol was signed between the two countries. Despite Gaddafi‚Äôs strong support for the Sudanese opposition leader Sadiq al- Mahdi, in December 1985, many Libyans labeled as ‚ÄúIslamic extremists,‚Äù were gathered and exiled from Sudan. In February 1986 the International Monetary Fund declared Sudan bankrupt, after the Dhahab government refused to accept IMF economic austerity measures. Later that year Sadiq al-Mahdi was declared the Prime Minister of Sudan. In a change of tone towards Libya, Mahdi unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the Libyan-Chadian conflict. The Mahdi government also permitted Libya to station some of its military forces in Darfur. From this position the troops assisted Chadian rebels in carrying out raids against government forces in Chad. However, in response to pressures from Egypt and the United States shortly thereafter, the Sudanese government requested a withdrawal of Libyan forces. On June 30, 1989, Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Omar al-Bashir overthrew Mahdi and created the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation to govern Sudan. Early in 1990 Sudan and Libya discussed the idea of unification between the two nations. In July of that year the first meeting of the Libyan-Sudanese Joint General People's Committee was held, and the Councils of Ministers of the two countries met in a combined session. The chief result of this meeting was greater economic cooperation, not the previously discussed political unification. Libya and Sudan signed a trade and development agreement that had Libyan investment in agricultural projects in exchange for guaranteed access for the Sudanese agricultural products. In October 1993, the Revolutionary Command Council which was created a few years earlier was dissolved. The leader of the coup d'√©tat, Lieutenant General Bashir, became a civilian president, and all the vital offices of government were now held by members of the NIF political party or their sympathizers. ‚ÄúThe pro-Libyan attitude of black African states has prompted Gaddafi to adopt a new foreign policy towards the continent. ‚ÄúIn general, the future of Libya‚Äôs relations with the countries of the region is likely to be influenced by Gaddafi‚Äôs rapprochement with the Arab countries and with the West.‚Äù Libyan and Sudanese ties were further cemented when in February 1999 an economic cooperation agreement was signed between the two countries and four other Sahel states. As alluded to earlier, Libya's relations with Sudan were in many respects a consequence of relations with Egypt. ‚ÄúParticularly important is the rapprochement with Egypt. The two countries have agreed to integrate their economies and to co-ordinate their African policies, especially in relations to Sudan. In August 1999, at a summit conference held in Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Gaddafi agreed to mediate an end to Sudan‚Äôs civil war. The regimes of both Libya and Egypt have confronted and/or continue to confront armed Islamic opposition and consequently both share an interest in Sudan, a country that has been accused of harboring radical Islamic groups. Above all, however, the Egyptian-Libyan initiative seems to reflect a joint fear on the part of the two countries that Washington supports the secession of southern Sudan and the break-up of an Arab country.‚Äù 21st century In the early 2000s, Sudan and Libya made concerted efforts to improve relations. The last half of 2002 witnessed a series of high-level meetings between Libya and Sudan. The Sudanese foreign minister at the time, Mustafa Uthman Isma‚Äôil, and his Libyan counterpart agreed to work for peace in Sudan within the framework of Sudanese unity, establish a committee for political coordination, and take measures to implement agreements on customs, the Nile international fund, trade, taxation, and investment. Also in 2002, the Higher Ministerial Committee for Libyan‚ÄìSudanese Integration agreed on a number of political and practical issues, including condemnation of American threats to launch ‚Äúunjustified aggression‚Äù against Iraq. In 2004, as the crisis in Darfur worsened, Libya hosted informal consultations between representatives of the Sudanese government and the rebel movements. The rebels rejected the Libyan initiative and insisted that the Joint Commission of the African Union serve as the principal interlocutor. This development did not deter First Vice President Taha in 2005 from urging al-Qadhafi to help find a solution to the Darfur crisis. Relations between Libya and Sudan were generally good but remained unpredictable, primarily as a result of the mercurial leadership in Tripoli. Sudan saw al-Qadhafi as a periodic problem that needed to be contained. It was better to bring him into the tent than to try to exclude him. As a result, Sudan did not object to al-Qadhafi‚Äôs efforts to mediate both the Darfur conflict and the earlier conflict in Eastern Sudan. The two countries settled on a policy of coexistence. In 2011, the Libyan Civil War occurred. Despite enjoyed a good bilateral relations since the end of Cold War, Omar al-Bashir soon declared supports for the opposition, blaming Gaddafi for supporting Darfur separatists. Sudanese Government armed the Libyan National Transitional Council, and eventually toppled the government of Muammar Gaddafi. With the fall and death of Libyan dictator, the Sudanese dictator hailed the fall of Gaddafi on his trip to Libya in 2012. Libyan leadership in 2011 also acknowledged their gratitude to Sudan for arming them against Gaddafi's force. In July 2017, General Khalifa Haftar of the Libyan National Army ordered the closing of the Sudanese consulate in the town of Kufra, and expelled 12 diplomats. The consul and 11 other consular staff were given 72 hours to leave the country. The reason given that the way it conducted its work was \\"damaging to Libyan national security.\\" The Sudanese government protested and summoned Libyan charge d'affaires in Khartoum, Ali Muftah Mahroug, in response. Sudan recognises the Government of National Accord in Tripoli as the government of Libya, not the House of Representatives that is backed by General Haftar. As of 2017 Sudan has not opened an embassy in Tripoli but maintains a consulate in the Libyan capital to provide service to Sudanese citizens.Khalifa Haftar expels 12 Sudan diplomats from Libya.

Minerals that are rich in kaolinite are known as china clay or kaolin, traditionally used in the manufacture of porcelain. The particle size of metakaolin is smaller than cement particles, but not as fine as silica fume.  Kaolinite sources  The quality and reactivity of metakaolin is strongly dependent of the characteristics of the raw material used. Metakaolin can be produced from a variety of primary and secondary sources containing kaolinite: * High purity kaolin deposits * Kaolinite deposits or tropical soils of lower purity * Paper sludge waste (if containing kaolinite) * Oil sand tailings (if containing kaolinite) Forming metakaolin The T-O clay mineral kaolinite does not contain interlayer cations or interlayer water. The temperature of dehydroxylation depends on the structural layer stacking order. Disordered kaolinite dehydroxylates between 530 and 570 ¬∞C, ordered kaolinite between 570 and 630 ¬∞C. Dehydroxylated disordered kaolinite shows higher pozzolanic activity than ordered. The dehydroxylation of kaolin to metakaolin is an endothermic process due to the large amount of energy required to remove the chemically bonded hydroxyl ions. Above the temperature range of dehydroxylation, kaolinite transforms into metakaolin, a complex amorphous structure which retains some long-range order due to layer stacking. Much of the aluminum of the octahedral layer becomes tetrahedrally and pentahedrally coordinated. In order to produce a pozzolan (supplementary cementitious material) nearly complete dehydroxylation must be reached without overheating, i.e., thoroughly roasted but not burnt. This produces an amorphous, highly pozzolanic state, whereas overheating can cause sintering, to form a dead burnt, nonreactive refractory, containing mullite and a defect Al-Si spinel. Reported optimum activation temperatures vary between 550 and 850 ¬∞C for varying durations, however the range 650-750 ¬∞C is most commonly quoted. In comparison with other clay minerals kaolinite shows a broad temperature interval between dehydroxylation and recrystallization, much favoring the formation of metakaolin and the use of thermally activated kaolin clays as pozzolans. Also, because the octahedral layer is directly exposed to the interlayer (in comparison to for instance T-O-T clay minerals such as smectites), structural disorder is attained more easily upon heating. High- reactivity metakaolin High-reactivity metakaolin (HRM) is a highly processed reactive aluminosilicate pozzolan, a finely-divided material that reacts with slaked lime at ordinary temperature and in the presence of moisture to form a strong slow-hardening cement. It is formed by calcining purified kaolinite, generally between 650‚Äì700 ¬∞C in an externally fired rotary kiln. It is also reported that HRM is responsible for acceleration in the hydration of ordinary portland cement (OPC), and its major impact is seen within 24 hours. It also reduces the deterioration of concrete by Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR), particularly useful when using recycled crushed glass or glass fines as aggregate. The amount of slaked lime that can be bound by metakaolin is measured by the modified Chapelle test.modified Chapelle test, Adsorption properties The adsorption surface properties of the metakaolins can be accomplished by inverse gas chromatography analysis. Concrete application Considered to have twice the reactivity of most other pozzolans, metakaolin is a valuable admixture for concrete/cement applications. Replacing portland cement with 8‚Äì20% (by weight) metakaolin produces a concrete mix that exhibits favorable engineering properties, including: the filler effect, the acceleration of OPC hydration, and the pozzolanic reaction.

Cottonwood has said that during every college break he would set out hitchhiking around the United States without money or a backpack, going wherever rides would take him. The experiences formed the basis of Famous Potatoes. One of Cottonwood's first plumbing jobs was what should have been a half-day project repairing a woman's shower. It turned into a three-day botch, but in the process he became friends with the woman's boyfriend (John Daniel) who wanted to be a book editor. They decided to jointly publish Famous Potatoes under the imprint of No Dead Lines Press. On the day of the press run, Cottonwood got a phone call from a New York City publisher (Seymour Lawrence, publisher of Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan) who wanted to buy the book on the condition that there be no competing self-published edition. It was too late to stop the press, so as 500 copies were being printed Cottonwood agreed never to sell them.

The ultimate goal of this state is to increase the wealth of its shareholders, and the government acknowledges its status as a corporation. Utilities, including hospitals, schools, the military, and the police force, would be privatized. Social welfare is carried out by corporations in the form of pensions and benefits to employees, instead of the state. Corporate republics do not exist officially in modern history. Modern competition laws and the development of modern nation-states prevent a company from gaining or being granted such amounts of political power. Historical states, such as post-classical Florence and the East India Company, may be described as corporate republics. Political scientists have also considered state socialist governments (criticised as state capitalist) to be forms of corporate republics, with the state assuming full control of all economic and political life and establishing a monopoly on everything within national boundaries, effectively making the state itself equatable to a giant corporation. Corporate republics are used in works of science fiction or political commentary as a warning of the perceived dangers of capitalism. In such works, they usually arise when one or more vastly powerful corporations depose a government either over an extended time period via regulatory capture or swiftly in a coup d'√©tat.  Examples  The typical examples of corporate republics throughout history are typically the imperial East India Companies and other such chartered companies during the early modern era, such as the VOC, or the Honorable East India Company. Lesser known examples include the International Association of the Congo (the predecessor to the Congo Free State), the British South Africa Company, and the Lanfang Republic. =Republic of Florence = The maritime city-state of Florence in northwestern Italy is argued to be a corporate republic based on two reasons. Like most of the merchant republics of Italy, Florence's social and economic life was dominated by vast guilds that regulate and control key industries in the city. The key difference between Florence and other contemporary republics like Venice was that the city was administered by a council, the Signoria of Florence, whose membership was restricted to seven major guilds of Florence. But due to the rigging of the Signoria electoral lottery system, members were typically those of influential families, making the republic an aristocracy. This was exacerbated by the legal restriction that elected offices are restricted to the family members of previous holders, which heralded the rise of the Medicis as a dynasty, legitimized by the 1533 ducal crowning of Alessandro de Medici, ending the Republic. = British East India Company = Starting in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey, the Company under Major-General Robert Clive was able to enthrone a puppet ruler in Bengal and was awarded the diwani, the right to collect revenue in Bengal and Bihar. Under subsequent Governor-Generals and their Presidency Armies, the Company was able to establish indirect British Rule in the Indian subcontinent until the revolt by the Sepoys (native Indian mercenaries) in 1857 forced the British Government to establish direct colonial rule in India. = Dutch East India Company = Another classic example of a corporatocracy, the Dutch East India Company (aka the VOC) was chartered by the Dutch Republic in order to monopolize trade in the East Indies and ensure the collective prosperity of the Republic. With the powers to conclude treaties, wage wars, imprison and execute convicts, strike its own coins, and establish colonies, the VOC created a vast corporate empire that set the standards for future transnational corporations.  In popular culture  *Robocop: Omni Consumer Products (OCP) is a modern example of the longstanding trope of the evil corporate republic in science fiction. *In the turn-based strategy game Civilization: Call to Power, a corporate republic is one of the futuristic government types available in the Genetic Age. *Shinra: one of the antagonists in the RPG Final Fantasy VII could be considered an example of a corporate republic due to its encompassing scope and massive power in planet affairs. *Max Barry's 2003 novel Jennifer Government portrays a world in which everything but the courts, police and military functions of government have been privatized, as has actually been proposed by minarchist libertarians. *Continuum: A new system of corporate republics, the North American Union, dominates a dystopian future, instituting a high-surveillance, technologically advanced police state and removing certain social freedoms, specifically criticism of the \\"Corporate Congress\\". * Prodigy, by Marie Lu: There is a government in which everything is controlled by 4 large companies: Cloud Corp, Meditech, DesCon Corp, and Evergreen Enterprises. * The Teladi Space Company from the X Computer Game Series is possibly another example of a corporate republic and is dominated by a near-religious lifestyle of profiteering.

Especially in condensed-matter physics, an energy gap is often known more abstractly as a spectral gap, a term which need not be specific to electrons or solids. Band gap If an energy gap exists in the band structure of a material, it is called band gap. The physical properties of semiconductors are to a large extent determined by their band gaps, but also for insulators and metals the band structure‚Äîand thus any possible band gaps‚Äîgovern their electronic properties. Superconducting energy gap For superconductors the energy gap is a region of suppressed density of states around the Fermi energy, with the size of the energy gap much smaller than the energy scale of the band structure. The superconducting energy gap is a key aspect in the theoretical description of superconductivity and thus features prominently in BCS theory. Here, the size of the energy gap indicates the energy gain for two electrons upon formation of a Cooper pair. If a conventional superconducting material is cooled from its metallic state (at higher temperatures) into the superconducting state, then the superconducting energy gap is absent above the critical temperature T_c, it starts to open upon entering the superconducting state at T_c, and it grows upon further cooling. BCS theory predicts that the size \\\\Delta of the superconducting energy gap for conventional superconductors at zero temperature scales with their critical temperature T_c : \\\\Delta(T=0)=1.764 \\\\, k_B T_c (with Boltzmann constant k_B). Pseudogap If the density of states is suppressed near the Fermi energy but does not fully vanish, then this suppression is called pseudogap. Pseudogaps are experimentally observed in a variety of material classes; a prominent example are the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Hard gap vs. soft gap If the density of states vanishes over an extended energy range, then this is called a hard gap. If instead the density of states exactly vanishes only for a single energy value (while being suppressed, but not vanishing for nearby energy values), then this is called a soft gap. A prototypical example of a soft gap is the Coulomb gap that exists in localized electron states with Coulomb interaction.

It is located on the Bellewaerde Ridge near Zillebeke, about 4 kilometres east of Ypres, and a little north of Hooge. The area of the Cambridge Road sector, halfway in between Wieltje and Hooge, was the site of intensive underground fighting in the First World War. The Liverpool Scottish Memorial, Railway Wood is located nearby. History The inscription on the base of the Cross of Sacrifice. The Royal Engineers grave at Railway Wood marks the site where twelve soldiers (eight Royal Engineers of the 177th Tunnelling Company and four attached infantrymen) were killed between November 1915 and August 1917 whilst tunnelling under the hill near Hooge during the defence of Ypres. The men were trapped underground and their bodies not recovered, and after the war, the memorial was erected on the hill.www.wo1.be accessed 19 June 2006wo1.be , accessed 19 June 2006 The site is unusual for being both a cemetery and a memorial. Because the bodies remain underground, the cemetery has no individual gravestones, and the names of the twelve men who died are inscribed on the Cross of Sacrifice instead. The inscription across three sides of the Cross of Sacrifice reads: Beneath this spot lie the bodies of an officer, three NCOs and eight men of or attached to the / 177th Tunnelling Company Royal Engineers / who were killed in action underground during the defence of Ypres between November 1915 and August 1917. The grounds were assigned to the United Kingdom in perpetuity by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of the sacrifices made by the British Empire in the defence and liberation of Belgium during the war and are administrated as a war cemetery by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Tunneling Mine crater at Railway Wood, located just behind the grave site When 177th Tunnelling Company arrived at Hooge in November 1915, underground warfare in the area was at its height. One of the busiest areas for the miners on both sides was Railway Wood, an area at Hooge where the old Ypres-Roeselare railway crossed the Ypres-Menen road. Aerial photographs clearly show the proliferation of mine warfare in the Railway Wood sector during the unit's presence there, with craters lying almost exclusively in no man's land between the British and German trenches. With both sides trying to undermine their enemy, much of the unit's activity at Railway Wood consisted of creating and maintaining a shallow fighting system with camouflets, a deeper defensive system as well as offensive galleries from an underground shaft. The 177th Tunnelling Company continued mining in the Hooge sector until August 1917. Fighting in the area continued until 1918, with the craters (being strategically important in relatively flat countryside) frequently changing sides.Battlefields 14-18, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 Lieutenant Boothby's letters The officer mentioned in the inscription on the Cross of Sacrifice was Second Lieutenant Charles Geoffrey Boothby (13 December 1894 ‚Äì 28 April 1916), service number 147252, from near Birmingham. He first attended Clayesmore School, then Christ College, Brecon, between 1909 and 1913. In the autumn of 1913, he entered Birmingham University, and spent a year studying dentistry. He was just short of his 20th birthday when he applied for a commission in December 1914. A year later he was seconded from 8th Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment to the Royal Engineers. Also in 1915, when he was twenty-one, Boothby had just met eighteen-year-old Edith Ainscow. They exchanged love letters over a period of 18 months until Boothby was reported missing in action in spring 1916, having been blown up by a German mine at Railway Wood on the Bellewaerde Ridge near Ypres. The letter exchange between Boothby and Ainscow survived the war and was eventually published by Edith's son, University of Oxford professor Arthur Stockwin, in 2005.

History The ABA expansion franchise, who would be based in Benton Harbor, Michigan but also claim \\"twin city\\" St. Joseph as home, was announced during a July 2006 new conference by owner Sidney Brooks (a travel agency owner in Chicago). The squad was assembled with a series of tryout camps in October, with a number of former Benton Harbor High School alumni selected for the team, such as Robert Whaley, Correy Childs, Prentice McGruder, Curtis McFall and Bryan Doss, with Peter Jackson as coach and Corey Sterling as general manager. The Twin City Ballers played their first ever game on 7 November 2006, beating the Peoria Kings 117-110 at home. The team reportedly drew \\"about 800\\" for each of its first three home games in Benton Harbour High School's Farnum Gym but the numbers dwindled rapidly (with an announced paying crowd of 65 for a late December game) and the team struggled financially after not securing sponsors (a reported $60,000 deal with Whirlpool Corporation did not come to fruition, allegedly because of poor attendance). Those financial problems led Brooks to lower the player's salaries (of between $175 and $300 per game) to $100 per game, with players quitting in response which saw the Ballers play a game on 30 December with only eight players. The organisation then cancelled a number of games and went on hiatus, training in Chicago's Lindbloom Park whilst Brooks looked to leave Benton Harbour (citing the lack of a local following) to move to Coloma, Michigan as the Southwest Michigan Ballers, nearly all the players (including all those from Benton Harbour High School), Peter Jackson and Corey Sterling had left and Jackson's assistant Johnell Williams was named as the new coach. The Coloma School Board ultimately refused to allow the team to use Coloma High School's gym, with the Ballers - who only had Remington Stewart and Quinnel Brown left from the initial roster - then playing all their games away, travelling by bus to Quebec City to play and lose two games in early February 2007. Though Brooks announced plans to play in Coloma, Covert or Watervliet in 2007‚Äì08, the team folded soon after, finishing its incomplete 2006‚Äì07 season with a 6-19 record.

Thread seal tape (also known as PTFE tape, Teflon tape, or plumber's tape) is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape commonly used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, making it easy to wind around pipe threads. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten. Typically the tape is wrapped around a pipe's thread three times before it is screwed into place. It is commonly used commercially in applications including pressurized water systems, central heating systems, and air compression equipment. Temperature Range: -268¬∞C to +260¬∞C (-450¬∞F to +500¬∞F). PTFE is completely stable up to +260ÀöC (500ÀöF). Decomposition is slow up to 400¬∞C (750¬∞F). Decomposition will occur on contact with open flames. Types PTFE tape used for different sized fittings There are two US standards for determining the quality of any thread seal tape. MIL-T-27730A (an obsolete military specification still commonly used in industry in the US) requires a minimum thickness of 3.5 mils and a minimum PTFE purity of 99%. The second standard, A-A-58092, is a commercial grade which maintains the thickness requirement of MIL-T-27730A and adds a minimum density of 1.2 g/cm3. Relevant standards may vary between industries; tape for gas fittings (to UK gas regulations) is required to be thicker than that for water. Although PTFE itself is suitable for use with high-pressure oxygen, the grade of tape must also be known to be free from grease. Thread seal tape used in plumbing applications is most commonly white, but it is also available in various colors. It is often used to correspond to color coded pipelines (US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: yellow for natural gas, green for oxygen, etc.). These color-codes for thread sealing tape were introduced by Bill Bentley of Unasco Pty Ltd in the 1970s. In the UK, tape is used from coloured reels, e.g. yellow reels for gas, green for oxygen. * White: used on NPT threads up to 3/8 inch * Yellow: used on NPT threads 1/2 inch to 2 inch, often labeled \\"gas tape\\" * Pink: used on NPT threads 1/2 inch to 2 inch, safe for potable water * Green: oil-free PTFE used on oxygen lines and some specific medical gasses * Gray: contains nickel, anti-seizing, anti-galling and anti-corrosion, used for stainless pipes * Copper: contains copper granules and is certified as a thread lubricant but not a sealer In Europe, the BSI standard BS-7786:2006 specifies various grades and quality standards of PTFE thread sealing tape.BS-7786:2006 Specification for unsintered PTFE tapes for general use Uses PTFE tape applied on an NPT fitting, in the direction of the threads. Thread seal tape is appropriate for use on tapered threads, where the sealing force is a wedge action. Parallel threads may not seal effectively with or without tape, as they are intended to be sealed by a gasket. Thread seal tape is almost always applied by hand, although at least one machine is available for production wrapping of fittings. Thread seal tape is also commonly used in the stretching of body piercings, through a process known as taping, because it is inert and safe for this use. The wearer wraps a layer of tape around a plug and uses the jewellery, adding another layer every few days, thus gradually stretching the piercing. =Hazards= Overuse or misapplication of thread seal tape may be a hazard. Excess application of tape can prevent mating threads from fully engaging, reducing the shear point of the threads. Combining thread seal tape with a pipe dope compound can also overload threads. Also, internal overhangs of loose material may constrict a joint or slough off and form a foreign body that could jam a valve seat. Therefore, use of tape as a thread sealant is generally not considered appropriate in fluid power (hydraulic) systems. Use of names Familiarity with the Teflon brand of fluoropolymers has led to the name becoming a generic trademark, and the practice of any PTFE-based thread seal tape being referred to as \\"Teflon tape\\". Chemours, owner of the Teflon trademark, no longer manufactures any thread seal tape, but objects to this practice.Real Teflon Brand Most references to \\"plumber's tape\\" nowadays refer to thread seal tape; however, the original use in the plumbing trade describes a strap of material with holes in it used for supporting pipes and fixtures. Example of the original strapping \\"plumber's tape\\".

The sonnet sequence was a very popular genre during the Renaissance, following the pattern of Petrarch. This article is about sonnet sequences as integrated wholes. For the form of individual sonnets, see Sonnet. Sonnet sequences are typically closely based on Petrarch, either closely emulating his example or working against it. The subject is usually the speaker's unhappy love for a distant beloved, following the courtly love tradition of the troubadours, from whom the genre ultimately derived. An exception is Edmund Spenser's Amoretti, where the wooing is successful, and the sequence ends with an Epithalamion, a marriage song. Although many sonnet sequences at least pretend to be autobiographical, the genre became a very stylised one, and most sonnet sequences are better approached as attempts to create an erotic persona in which wit and originality plays with the artificiality of the genre. Thus one could regard the emotions evoked to be as artificial as the conventions with which they are presented.

He is particularly notable for his invention of the Schneider-Danglis mountain gun, his service as chief of staff in the Balkan Wars and his participation in the Triumvirate of the Provisional Government of National Defence during World War I.  Life  =Origin and early life= Panagiotis Danglis was born in Atalanti on 17 November 1853, where his father was serving in an infantry battalion. The family had a long and distinguished history: Panagiotis was named after his grandfather, Giotis Danglis, a Suliot chieftain who had begun serving under Napoleon during the second French occupation of the Ionian Islands, and had become a general during the Greek War of Independence. His son, Georgios Danglis (1809‚Äì1896), was born in exile in Corfu, entered the Greek Army in 1828 in time to fight in the last campaigns of the War of Independence, and after a long career rose to the rank of major general. Panagiotis Danglis was the fourth child of his parents, but only the oldest, his sister Christina, born in 1843, had survived infancy. His two older brothers died early, as did many of his younger siblings, apart from another sister, Polyxeni, born in 1858. During his first years, he followed his father around the various garrison towns in Central Greece. In 1857‚Äì1860 the family stayed at Stylida, where Danglis first went into school. In 1860‚Äì1862 the family moved to the capital, Athens, where Danglis attended a private school. After participating in the suppression of the failed Nafplion revolt against King Otto in early 1862, Danglis' father was promoted to major and the family moved to Agrinio. From this small provincial town Danglis experienced the tumultuous events of Otto's ouster, the arrival of King George I in 1863, the union of the Ionian islands with Greece, and the outbreak of the Cretan Revolution of 1866‚Äì1869. In September 1867 he returned to Athens to attend the first class of high school in the prestigious Varvakeion high school, staying with his maternal grandmother, and his unmarried aunt. Danglis completed the second and third classes of high school at Missolonghi, spending the summers with his family at Agrinio. Although successfully promoted to the fourth class, in July 1870 he decided to enter the Hellenic Army Academy. With the agreement of his father, he returned to Athens on 23 August. After passing the entrance examinations in early September, he enrolled as a cadet on 6 November. During that summer, Danglis also composed a novel, titled \\"Penelope\\", which was published in Athens in 1871. =Early military career= Training at the Academy Danglis as a first-year cadet, 1870 Danglis enrolled in the Army Academy at a crucial juncture: the institution had been badly neglected in the previous years, and only 13 students were attending it when Danglis entered it. His class of 31 cadets, and the reform of its curriculum by the then Minister for Military Affairs, Lt. Colonel Charalambos Zymvrakakis, breathed new life into it. Danglis was a distinguished student. He graduated to the second and third years in third place (only 17 of his class graduated to the second year), and received his first promotion, to Corporal, in 1872. He then scored first in his class during all subsequent the exams, except for scoring second during the general theoretical exams between the fifth and sixth classes. Promoted to Sergeant Major in 1874, he and his classmates of the senior year began enjoying the social life of Athens. Danglis graduated from the Academy in August 1877 top of his class, and was commissioned as Ensign of Artillery, like most of his colleagues. The artillery, recently enlarged due to a possible Greek participation in the ongoing Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78, was facing extreme shortages in qualified officers at the time. The undeclared war of 1878 and its aftermath Danglis began his service at the 1st Artillery Regiment in Athens, amidst a heady atmosphere of war preparations. On 26 October he was posted to the 6th Mountain Battery, recently equipped with new Krupp guns. The battery moved from Athens to Lamia, close to the then border with the Ottoman Empire, in November. Popular enthusiasm ran high, especially after the Russian army overcame the stubborn Ottoman resistance at the Siege of Plevna‚Äîmuch admired by Danglis in his notes‚Äîand advanced towards Constantinople. Revolutionary movements broke out in Crete and Epirus, while the Greek government under Alexandros Koumoundouros finally edged towards entry into the war to safeguard Greek territorial claims and interests. Danglis served in the army of Eastern Greece, under the command of Major General , a nominal force of 6,800 men‚ÄîDanglis estimated the effectives at 5,500‚Äì6,000 at the most. The army set out from Lamia on 21 January, and crossed the border on the next day, despite the onset of extreme cold and heavy rainfall. The local Ottoman garrisons withdrew to Domokos, but the Greek expedition was a fiasco: the bad weather, including snow, and the bad organization led to a dispersal of forces. Finally, on 25 January the Greek force encircled Domokos, and Soutsos began negotiations with the Ottoman commander for its surrender. On the next day, however, the Greek government ordered its troops to return home, as the Russians and Ottomans had signed an armistice on 19 January, and the Great Powers had put pressure on Athens to endure peace. By 28 January, Danglis was back with his unit in Lamia. On 7 February 1878, Danglis was promoted to Second Lieutenant in a slew of promotions across the army. From Lamia he observed the failure of the uprisings in Thessaly and Epirus and Crete, while Greek interests were championed on the diplomatic front by Great Britain as a counter to Russian designs. The political situation remained tense: the Congress of Berlin had decided to award Thessaly up to the Pineios River and Epirus up to the Thyamis River to Greece, but the Ottoman government dragged its feet. Greco-Ottoman negotiations at Preveza in early 1879, and in Constantinople in September‚ÄìDecember 1879, broke down. On 13 April 1878, following actions by his father, Danglis was transferred to the 3rd Mountain Battery at his family's home town of Agrinio. The artillery was moved to Lefkada in October 1878, and to a newly constructed but ephemeral encampment at Lepenous‚Äînot coincidentally, the electoral district of the then Minister of Military Affairs, Dimitrios Grivas‚Äîin May‚ÄìJuly 1879. From there Danglis moved with his battery to Athens in August, before being posted to the Arsenal in Nafplion in October, where he assumed command of the artificers' company. On 21 December, he published in the daily Athens newspaper an anonymous article‚Äîsigned only as \\"Omega\\" and identifying himself only as a professional officer‚Äîrequesting the removal of the army from the influence of politicians. Map of the territorial expansion of Greece, with Thessaly and the Arta area marked in light blue The ongoing dispute over Epirus and Thessaly meant that the army had been maintained far larger than its peacetime establishment since 1878, to the detriment of the already feeble Greek budget. Thus the 1880 government of Charilaos Trikoupis decided to cut down on military expenses, demobilizing soldiers and reducing the size of the army. This decision proved short-lived, as the Great Powers convened at Berlin in June 1880 and reconfirmed the decisions of 1878, forcing the government to once again engage in preparations for a possible conflict with Turkey; hasty purchases of equipment began in Europe, and in July, a full mobilization aimed at producing a 60,000-strong field army began. Danglis returned to the 1st Artillery Regiment at Athens in October, assigned to the 1st Field Battery. As a result of the increase in the size of the army‚Äîalready comprising over 45,000 men in late October, and with an establishment strength revised upwards to 82,000 men in December‚Äîon 6 December numerous officers were promoted; Danglis was promoted to Lieutenant. In March 1881, the Greek army once again started assembling near the border. On 1 April, Danglis left Piraeus for Agrinio by ship, while his battery moved over land. Due to malaria at Agrinio, his unit moved to Missolonghi, where he assumed command of the 1st Battery. In the meantime, the Great Powers and the Ottoman government had reached an agreement that reduced the amount of territory to be ceded to Greece: in Epirus, only the area around Arta would be ceded. Following pressure by the Powers, the Greek government conceded in the Convention of Constantinople on 2 July. Arta was occupied on 24 June, but Danglis did not arrive until 20 July, taking over command of the 2nd Mountain Battery. Over the next few months, Danglis was transferred with his unit from Arta to Lefkada, Missolonghi, and Agrinio. In late December 1881, Danglis was appointed commander of the 4th Mountain Battery, as well as a squadron comprising the 3rd and 4th Field Batteries, at Arta. His life and career for the next two years is unknown, as little material survives in his archives, apart from reports on tests of Krupp-type artillery packs for mules in April and August 1883. Belgium, the Vosseur mission and the Rumelian crisis Danglis was promoted to Captain in 1883. Late in that year, he went to Belgium for further studies, the cost of 1,000 francs paid for by his father, who did not hesitate to take loans to that end. In January 1884, he was attached to an artillery regiment at Liege, where he remained until his return to Greece in August. From his letters to his father, Danglis was less than satisfied with his experiences in Belgium, noting critically that \\"they are not far ahead of us, one sees a lot of 'Greek things' [·ø•œâŒºŒ≠œäŒ∫Œ±] here as well\\". On his return was appointed adjutant to Brigadier Victor Vosseur, the head of the 1884‚Äì87 French military mission, which had been tasked by Trikoupis with modernizing the Greek Army. The results of the mission, as laid out by Danglis himself in a report requested by the Ministry of Military Affairs in 1898, were meagre, mostly because the mission's recommendations were ignored or modified by the Greek governments, particularly the 1885‚Äì1886 government of Theodoros Diligiannis, which was viscerally opposed to any policies espoused by Trikoupis. Nevertheless, the Deligiannis government was involved in a major diplomatic and military crisis with the Ottoman Empire, resulting from the de facto annexation of Eastern Rumelia to the Principality of Bulgaria in September 1885. Deligiannis demanded comparable territorial compensation for Greece from the Ottomans and threatened war, mobilizing the army. As Vosseur's adjutant, Danglis was in a privileged position to observe events. The new army organization, drafted by Vosseur, was voted by Parliament in December, and by April 1886 the army, including the Gendarmerie, had reached a strength of some 75,000 men. As Danglis points out, however, due to lack of training, equipment, and trained officers, only about 50,000 were capable of fighting. Under the pen name \\"Shell\\" (·ΩàŒ≤ŒØœÇ), Danglis published two articles outlining his opinion on the best deployment of the army in the Akropolis newspaper on 5 and 11 January. The Greek government had driven itself into a corner: despite its belligerent rhetoric, it was loath to carry through with its threat of war, and came under intense pressure by the Great Powers to back down, including the blockade of Phaleron by the fleets of the Powers on 26 April. Deligiannis resigned, and after a brief caretaker government under Dimitrios Valvis, Trikoupis returned to power on 8 May. On the next day, as Trikoupis was forming his government, clashes broke out between the Greek and Turkish troops along the line of the border in Thessaly. The clashes lasted until a ceasefire on 11 May, and although generally the Greeks held their own and scored some successes, Danglis considered it fortunate that the ceasefire took place when it did, as Greece had about 40,000 men deployed facing three times as many Ottoman troops; without any readily available reserves, and exhausted after three days of fighting, the Greek front was brittle, and any Turkish breakthrough would face no opposition to advancing to Larissa. Furthermore, in two places Greek troops had performed poorly: at Koutra, 300 men of the 5th Evzone Battalion had surrendered to the Turks, while at Patsos an entire infantry company fled after an attack by a much smaller Turkish detachment. The two captains responsible for the Koutra incident were court-martialled and condemned to death in August 1887, although the death sentence was immediately commuted by the King. On 8 August 1887, Danglis, again under the pen name \\"Shell\\", published an article in Akropolis fiercely critical of the two men. Peacetime service and private life In the meantime, in January 1886, through the mediation of a retired colonel, Danglis met and became engaged to Sofia Mostra, the 16-year-old daughter of the naval architect‚Äîand fellow Army Academy graduate and Epirote‚ÄîSpyridon Mostras (1827‚Äì1899) and Eleni Mela. Their wedding took place on 20 April 1886. The newlywed couple initially lodged in the Mostras family residence at Voukourestiou Street 9. On the occasion of the Bastille Day celebrations in 1886, Danglis received the medal of a knight of the Legion of Honour from the French government. In July and August 1886, Danglis and his wife visited Constantinople and its environs, with Danglis keeping detailed daily notes on the trip in a small notebook. As a member of the Athens garrison, Danglis took part in the festivities to celebrate the coming of age of the Crown Prince, the future Constantine I, in December. On the occasion, on 1 December he received the Silver Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. In the early hours of 6 August 1887, Danglis' first daughter was born. In December 1887, with the departure of the French military mission, Danglis returned to the 1st Artillery Regiment, taking over command of the 3rd Field Battery on 10 December. In February 1888, a translation by Danglis of a treatise (La mission militaire suisse sur le th√©√¢tre de la guerre serbo-bulgare) by the Swiss colonel Hugo Hungerb√ºhler on the 1885 Serbo- Bulgarian War, was printed in 1,000 copies. He was promoted to Major in 1892, and in the next year invented the Schneider-Danglis mountain gun. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 he served as chief of staff of I Brigade in the Army of Epirus, and fought at the Battle of Gribovo. In the General Staff A Lieutenant Colonel since 1902, he was transferred to the newly founded General Staff Corps in 1904. Promoted to Colonel in 1907, he participated in the last stages of the Macedonian Struggle in 1908, supervising operations for the \\"Macedonian Committee\\" in the Salonica area under the nom de guerre of Parmenion. Following the 1909 Goudi coup, the General Staff Corps was disbanded and Danglis returned to the Artillery, serving as commander of the Army Academy (1910), the 1st Infantry Division, the Greek Gendarmerie, and the 2nd Infantry Division (1911). In 1911, Danglis was promoted to Major General, and became head of the Army General Staff in August 1912, and on the outbreak of the First Balkan War two months later he became chief of staff to Crown Prince Constantine's Army of Thessaly until November 1912, when he became a member of the Greek delegation in the London Peace Conference. = Commander in Epirus = Following the assassination of King George in Thessaloniki, Constantine, now king, had to leave Ioannina. Departing, he named Danglis as commander of the army in Epirus, comprising the 2nd, 3rd, 8th, and 13th divisions. Operations had largely concluded so that his main task was completing the occupation of Northern Epirus, pacifying the local population, and strengthening Greek claims in the region, which were being challenged by Italy. Danglis, however, saw this move as the result of machinations by his rivals in the General Staff‚ÄîDousmanis foremost‚Äîto remove him from the military high command. Constantine continued to show favour to his former chief of staff, naming him to the honorary position of adjutant-general to the King (with Dousmanis as adjutant) on 8 March, and awarding him the cross of the Grand Commander of the Order of the Redeemer on 21 May, but Danglis' requests to return to Athens and resume his proper post were left unanswered; although his appointment was originally termed \\"temporary\\", he would continue to command the army in Epirus, later constituted briefly as the III Army Corps and eventually as the V Army Corps, for over two years. After the end of the Second Balkan War, on 9‚Äì18 August 1913 Danglis went to Thessaloniki, where he chaired the council of division commanders (then the highest-ranking officers in the army) to decide on the promotions of the career and reserve officers. On 19 August he left by train for Aix-les-Bains, where his family was already on holiday, arriving there on the 25th. On the previous day, however, King Constantine had caused a major diplomatic incident during a speech in Germany: after receiving the rank and baton of a German Generalfeldmarschall by the Kaiser, Constantine had ascribed the Greek successes in the Balkan Wars to the training he and his aides had received in Germany. News of this speech caused uproar in France, leading to a diplomatic crisis with Greece. As a result, on 29 August Danglis‚Äîpromoted to Lieutenant General at about that time‚Äîwas ordered to interrupt his vacation and participate, as the official representative of Greece, in the French great field manoeuvres of the year, that had already begun. His participation there, his reputation as a \\"true friend of France\\", as well as a judicious and carefully worded interview in the Le Temps that paid tribute to the contributions of the French military mission, quickly calmed the situation and helped restore the Franco-Greek relationship. He then returned to Aix, only to be recalled to Greece by Venizelos on 13 September. =Politics, World War I and the National Schism= In late 1914, he left the army and went into politics, joining the Liberal Party of Eleftherios Venizelos in 1915 and elected as an MP for Epirus representing Ioannina. He served as Minister for Military Affairs in Venizelos' short-lived cabinet (10 August ‚Äì 24 September) in 1915, and supported Venizelos during his struggle against King Constantine in 1915‚Äì16. In August 1916, along with Venizelos and admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, he formed the leading triumvirate of the \\"Provisional Government of National Defence\\", a separate government in Thessaloniki. In 1917, Greece formally joined the Entente Powers in the First World War. Danglis was appointed nominal commander-in-chief of the Greek Army, a position he retained until near the war's end when he returned to his parliamentary office. He was formally discharged from the Army on 7 October 1920. In 1921, Danglis succeeded the self-exiled Venizelos as president of the Liberal Party. He died in Athens on 9 March 1924.

The enzyme structure and its two step catalytic, irreversible mechanism have been well studied. PEP carboxylase is highly regulated, both by phosphorylation and allostery. Enzyme structure The PEP carboxylase enzyme is present in plants and some types of bacteria, but not in fungi or animals (including humans). The genes vary between organisms, but are strictly conserved around the active and allosteric sites discussed in the mechanism and regulation sections. Tertiary structure of the enzyme is also conserved. The crystal structure of PEP carboxylase in multiple organisms, including Zea mays (maize), and Escherichia coli has been determined. The overall enzyme exists as a dimer-of-dimers: two identical subunits closely interact to form a dimer through salt bridges between arginine (R438 - exact positions may vary depending on the origin of the gene) and glutamic acid (E433) residues. This dimer assembles (more loosely) with another of its kind to form the four subunit complex. The monomer subunits are mainly composed of alpha helices (65%), and have a mass of 106kDa each. The sequence length is about 966 amino acids.; The enzyme active site is not completely characterized. It includes a conserved aspartic acid (D564) and a glutamic acid (E566) residue that non-covalently bind a divalent metal cofactor ion through the carboxylic acid functional groups. This metal ion can be magnesium, manganese or cobalt depending on the organism, and its role is to coordinate the phosphoenolpyruvate molecule as well as the reaction intermediates. A histidine (H138) residue at the active site is believed to facilitate proton transfer during the catalytic mechanism. Enzyme mechanism The mechanism of PEP carboxylase has been well studied. The enzymatic mechanism of forming oxaloacetate is very exothermic and thereby irreversible; the biological Gibbs free energy change (‚ñ≥G¬∞‚Äô) is -30kJmol‚àí1. The substrates and cofactor bind in the following order: metal cofactor (either Co2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+), PEP, bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí). The mechanism proceeds in two major steps, as described below and shown in figure 2: Figure 2: the Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase enzymatic mechanism converting bicarbonate and PEP to oxaloacetate and phosphate. # The bicarbonate acts as a nucleophile to attack the phosphate group in PEP. This results in the splitting of PEP into a carboxyphosphate and the (very reactive) enolate form of pyruvate. # Proton transfer takes place at the carboxyphosphate. This is most likely modulated by a histidine (H138) residue that first deprotonates the carboxy side, and then, as an acid, protonates the phosphate part. The carboxyphosphate then exothermically decomposes into carbon dioxide and inorganic phosphate, at this point making this an irreversible reaction. Finally, after the decomposition, the carbon dioxide is attacked by the enolate to form oxaloacetate. The metal cofactor is necessary to coordinate the enolate and carbon dioxide intermediates; the CO2 molecule is only lost 3% of the time. The active site is hydrophobic to exclude water, since the carboxyphosphate intermediate is susceptible to hydrolysis.  Function  The three most important roles that PEP carboxylase plays in plants and bacteria metabolism are in the cycle, the CAM cycle, and the citric acid cycle biosynthesis flux. The primary mechanism of carbon dioxide assimilation in plants is through the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (also known as RuBisCO), that adds CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (a 5 carbon sugar), to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (2x3 carbon sugars). However, at higher temperatures and lower CO2 concentrations, RuBisCO adds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, to form the unusable product glycolate in a process called photorespiration. To prevent this wasteful process, plants increase the local CO2 concentration in a process called the cycle. PEP carboxylase plays the key role of binding CO2 in the form of bicarbonate with PEP to create oxaloacetate in the mesophyll tissue. This is then converted back to pyruvate (through a malate intermediate), to release the CO2 in the deeper layer of bundle sheath cells for carbon fixation by RuBisCO and the Calvin cycle. Pyruvate is converted back to PEP in the mesophyll cells, and the cycle begins again, thus actively pumping CO2. The second important and very similar biological significance of PEP carboxylase is in the CAM cycle. This cycle is common in organisms living in arid habitats. Plants cannot afford to open stomata during the day to take in CO2, as they would lose too much water by transpiration. Instead, stomata open at night, when water evaporation is minimal, and take in CO2 by fixing with PEP to form oxaloacetate though PEP carboxylase. Oxaloacetate is converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase, and stored for use during the day when the light dependent reaction generates energy (mainly in the form of ATP) and reducing equivalents such as NADPH to run the Calvin cycle. Third, PEP carboxylase is significant in non-photosynthetic metabolic pathways. Figure 3 shows this metabolic flow (and its regulation). Similar to pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxylase replenishes oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle. At the end of glycolysis, PEP is converted to pyruvate, which is converted to acetyl- coenzyme-A (acetyl-CoA), which enters the citric acid cycle by reacting with oxaloacetate to form citrate. To increase flux through the cycle, some of the PEP is converted to oxaloacetate by PEP carboxylase. Since the citric acid cycle intermediates provide a hub for metabolism, increasing flux is important for the biosynthesis of many molecules, such as for example amino acids.  Regulation Figure 3: the Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase regulation pathways PEP carboxylase is mainly subject to two levels of regulation: phosphorylation and allostery. Figure 3 shows a schematic of the regulatory mechanism. Phosphorylation by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase turns the enzyme on, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase phosphatase turns it back off. Both kinase and phosphate are regulated by transcription. It is further believed that malate acts as a feedback inhibitor of kinase expression levels, and as an activator for phosphatase expression (transcription). Since oxaloacetate is converted to malate in CAM and organisms, high concentrations of malate activate phosphatase expression - the phosphatase subsequently de- phosphorylates and thus de-actives PEP carboxylase, leading to no further accumulation of oxaloacetate and thus no further conversion of oxaloacetate to malate. Hence malate production is down-regulated. The main allosteric inhibitors of PEP carboxylase are the carboxylic acids malate (weak) and aspartate (strong). Since malate is formed in the next step of the CAM and cycles after PEP carboxylase catalyses the condensation of CO2 and PEP to oxaloacetate, this works as a feedback inhibition pathway. Oxaloacetate and aspartate are easily inter-convertible through a transaminase mechanism; thus high concentrations of aspartate are also a pathway of feedback inhibition of PEP carboxylase. The main allosteric activators of PEP carboxylase are acetyl- CoA and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP). Both molecules are indicators of increased glycolysis levels, and thus positive feed-forward effectors of PEP carboxylase. They signal the need to produce oxaloacetate to allow more flux through the citric acid cycle. Additionally, increased glycolysis means a higher supply of PEP is available, and thus more storage capacity for binding CO2 in transport to the Calvin cycle. It is also noteworthy that the negative effectors aspartate competes with the positive effector acetyl-CoA, suggesting that they share an allosteric binding site. Studies have shown that energy equivalents such as AMP, ADP and ATP have no significant effect on PEP carboxylase. The magnitudes of the allosteric effects of these different molecules on PEP carboxylase activity depend on individual organisms.

These piles contain lead-contaminated dust and are part of the reasons the area is designated as the Tar Creek Superfund site. Chat is fragments of siliceous rock, limestone, and dolomite waste rejected in the lead-zinc milling operations that accompanied lead-zinc mining in the first half of the 20th century. Historic lead and zinc mining in the Midwestern United States was centered in two major areas: the tri-state area covering more than in southwestern Missouri, southeastern Kansas, and northeastern Oklahoma and the Old Lead Belt covering about in southeastern Missouri. The first recorded mining occurred in the Old Lead Belt in about 1742. The production increased significantly in both the tri-state area and the Old Lead Belt during the mid-19th century and lasted up to 1970. Cleanup Currently production still occurs in a third area, the Viburnum Trend, in southeastern Missouri. Mining and milling of ore produced more than 500 million tons of wastes in the tri- state area and about 250 million tons of wastes in the Old Lead Belt. More than 75 percent of this waste has been removed, with some portion of it used over the years. Today, approximately 100 million tons of chat remain in the tri-state area. The EPA, the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri, local communities, and private companies continue to work together in implementing and monitoring response actions that reduce or remove potential adverse impacts posed by remaining mine wastes contaminated with lead, zinc, cadmium, and other metals. Ore processing Ore production consisted of crushing and grinding the rock to standard sizes and separating the ore. Ore processing was accomplished in either a dry gravity separation or through a wet washing or flotation separation. Dry processes produced a fine gravel waste commonly called ‚Äúchat.‚Äù The wet processes resulted in the creation of tailing ponds used to dispose of waste material after ore separation. The wastes from wet separation are typically sand and silt size and are called ‚Äútailings.‚Äù Milling produces large chat waste piles and flat areas with tailings deposited in impoundments. Tailings generally contain higher concentrations of heavy metals and therefore present a higher risk to human health and the environment through direct contact. Chat typically ranges in diameter from 1/4 to 5/8 inch. Intermingled material such as sands measure 0.033-0.008 inches in diameter and fine tailings are less than in diameter. Uses Although poisonous, chat can be used to improve traction on snow-covered roads; as gravel; and as construction aggregate, principally for railroad ballast, highway construction, and concrete production.

Its studios and offices are located along the West Loop Freeway in Uptown Houston. KODA has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The Senior Road Tower transmitter is off Farm to Market Road 2234 near Fort Bend Parkway in Southwest Houston.Radio-Locator.com/KODA KODA broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format, with its sister station KTRH 740 AM simulcast on the HD2 subchannel and a Spanish-language Christian radio service on HD3. History On Christmas Eve 1946, the station signed on as KPRC-FM. It was owned by the Houston Post daily newspaper, which also owned KPRC 950 AM and would put KPRC-TV Channel 2 on the air in 1949. (The call sign referred to Post Radio Company.) In its early years, KPRC-FM mostly simulcast its AM sister station. KPRC-FM began broadcasting on 99.7 MHz until 1947 when it moved to 102.9 MHz. In 1958, the FM station was sold and changed its call sign to KHGM-FM. It moved to its current frequency in 1959. In 1961, it changed call letters again, this time to KODA-FM, airing a beautiful music format. (KODA refers to the musical term coda, indicating an extended passage which brings a piece to an end.) Several months later, 1010 AM KODA went on the air (now KLAT). It operated as a daytimer. The two stations simulcast while KODA 1010 was on the air. KODA-FM continued the station's programming independently from sunset to sunrise, when KODA 1010 was on the air again. KODA-AM-FM and their easy listening sound proved to be quite popular, and enjoyed high ratings through the 1960s and 70s. KODA-AM-FM were sold to Group W Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1978 and was shortly broken up when the AM station was quickly re-sold. The easy listening format continued on KODA-FM, which was renamed KODA when the AM station took new call letters. The station was the flagship radio station for the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) of the National Football League during the 1986 season. The station was sold to SFX Broadcasting in 1989. SFX was amalgamated into AM/FM Inc. and acquired by Clear Channel Communications in 1999. By the mid-1990s, KODA had begun adding more vocals to its playlist, and reducing the instrumentals, until it made the transition to soft adult contemporary. The station, which had long been identified as K-O-D-A or \\"Coda\\", relabeled itself as \\"The All- New SUNNY 99.1\\" in February 1991.

It is the oldest Church of Ireland church in Belfast. It was designed by Irish architect, John Bowden, and opened in 1816. Major refurbishment work was completed in June 2000. History The church stands on what had been a fording place where the River Lagan and River Farset met. The earliest mention of a place of worship existing on this site is in the papal taxation rolls of 1306. The Chapel of the Ford was a chapel of ease of the main parish church at Shankill, and was constructed here for those waiting to cross the mud flats which covered most of the area that has since become central Belfast. The chapel later became known as Corporation Chapel after the newly founded Belfast Corporation. Painting of multiple miracles by Jesus on the north wall of the chancel by Alexander Gibbs, created in 1883/4. Stained glass window in the south aisle of King David, created by Sillery, Dublin, 1870 By the time of the Plantation of Ulster, the church had become the main parish church for the area. In 1613 James I of England granted a charter to Belfast as a key garrison town in the plantation, and St. George's became the 'corporation' church. William of Orange passed through Belfast on his way from Carrickfergus to the Battle of the Boyne, and had a famous sermon, Arise Great King, preached to him here. By the late 18th century, however, the church had fallen into disrepair and the Earl of Chichester, the dominant local landowner, gave land for a new parish church for Belfast to be built on a more expansive site a few hundred metres away on Donegall Street. This church would later become St Anne's Cathedral. Henry Joy McCracken, a leading member of the Society of the United Irishmen and 1798 rebellion was buried in the churchyard after being hanged, before later being moved to Clifton Street Cemetery. However, by the 1800s, the growth of industrial Belfast necessitated a second Anglican church being built, and a new St. George's was built on the old site, opening in 1816. Throughout the 19th century, the church had a series of rectors known for their flamboyant style, and in the early 20th century, St. George's developed its distinct High Church ethos. The movement of people out of the City Centre in the 20th century saw the congregation drop, and during The Troubles, the church was seriously damaged on a number of occasions by Provisional Irish Republican Army bombs. The portico was originally made to order in Egypt for the 4th Earl of Bristol's palace at Ballyscullion, near Derry (1788). St. George's continues to be noted for its liturgical and musical tradition ‚Äì it has one of the few men's and boys' church choirs in Ireland. Its ministry, both to the business community and to Belfast's homeless population, are an important part of parish life. St. George's has a diverse congregation, drawing members from different religious, cultural and social backgrounds. As of 2010, the rector of St George's (since 1994) is the Reverend Brian Stewart and Director of Music is Dr Emma Gibbins. Architecture The church was designed by John Bowden of Dublin in 1811. The foundation stone was laid in June 1813 by the Earl of Massereene and the church opened in June 1816. It has a simple nave and chancel plan and is built of sandstone. Inside there is a gallery on three sides. The church originally had a plain ceiling, but in 1865 the ceiling was removed and the trusses exposed and decorated by architect W. J. Barre, who also added a new pulpit in 1867. A chancel, designed by Edward Bradell, was added in 1882. The west end, facing High Street, has a large Corinthian pillared portico, giving the impression that it is a two storied building. The portico was originally made to order in Egypt for Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry, to adorn the main entrance of Ballyscullion House in County Londonderry, built in 1788. After the Earl died in 1803, the house was gradually dismantled and the portico was bought and transported to Belfast. To reach its new home, the portico was initially hauled by horse and cart to Lough Neagh. From there it went by barge, reputedly the first barge cargo brought to Belfast from Lough Neagh by the new Lagan Canal Navigation (now disused). The coats of arms on the pediment are of the Diocese of Down and the city of Belfast. Traditions St. George's was the first Anglican church in Ireland to introduce Harvest Thanksgiving, musical recitals in church, early morning celebrations of the Holy Communion, a robed choir, drama in church, the Christmas Midnight Eucharist, the Three Hours Devotions on Good Friday, and to adopt the 1984 Alternative Prayer Book of the Church of Ireland.

The Sean-Bhean bhocht is used to personify Ireland, a poetic motif which heralds back to the aisling of native Irish Language poetry. Many different versions of the song have been composed by balladeers over the years, with the lyrics adapted to reflect the political climate at the time of composition. The title of the song, tune and narration of the misfortunes of the Shean Bhean bhocht remain a constant however, and this version, probably the best known, expresses confidence in the victory of the United Irishmen in the looming rebellion upon the arrival of French aid. W. B. Yeats and Augusta, Lady Gregory based their 1902 nationalist play, Cathleen N√≠ Houlihan, on the legend dramatized in this song. A more recent version of the character is the speaker in Tommy Makem's \\"Four Green Fields,\\" a song composed in the modern context of Northern Ireland's partition from the Republic of Ireland.

He was one of the founders of the Anglo German Parliamentary Group, which promoted good relations with the German Parliament. He instigated the annual conferences with German Parliamentarians, the first conference being held at his Hertfordshire home. Life Rost's parents, Friedrich Rosenstiel and Elisabeth Merz, were a mixed marriage German Jew and Lutheran living in Berlin during the Nazi era. Their marriage was annulled and they escaped to the United Kingdom in 1937 before the international border was closed to Jews. Fred Rosenstiel was the economics editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung in Berlin. He later left for New York City, but the family was unable to follow him. Rost was educated at various schools finishing in the VIth form at Aylesbury Grammar School and at Birmingham University where he read Geography. Before entering Parliament, he was a stockbroker, lecturer and financial journalist. Rost unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour constituency of Sunderland North at the 1966 general election, and at the 1970 general election he was elected as MP for the previously Labour-held seat of South East Derbyshire. He held that seat until the constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, when he was returned to the House of Commons for the new Erewash. He retired from Parliament at the 1992 election. Rost has been a member of the Conservative Monday Club and the Bow Group where he chaired the energy group. Autobiography Peter Rost's autobiography \\"Weimar to Westminster\\" was published in November 2010 by Dynasty Press, London, . In popular culture Rost was portrayed by Julian Firth in the 2004 BBC production of The Alan Clark Diaries. Energy Interests Peter Rost's main interest in Parliament was in \\"Energy\\". He was the longest-serving Member of the Energy Select Committee, where he was way ahead of his time in his promotion of renewable energy. He was an active member of the Combined Heat and Power Association (CHPA) of which he became Vice-President. He constantly bemoaned the loss of heat up the cooling towers of the UK power stations and actively promoted district heating schemes. In the 1970s he warned of the wasteful use of Gas for power production, wasting the precious North Sea assets.

Built in the 1720s, the palace offers a mixture of rococo, Gustavian and Victorian styles. The interior design is regarded as one of Sweden's finest. Tullgarn Palace is mainly associated with King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria, who spent their summers here at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. However, the palace was originally built for Duke Fredrik Adolf in the 1770s. Since Tullgarn was a popular summer palace amongst Swedish royalty, the palace houses fine examples of interiors from different epochs and personal styles, such as the small drawing room, decorated in the 1790s, the breakfast room in southern German Renaissance style from the 1890s and Gustav V's cigar room, which has remained largely untouched since his death in 1950.  History  A map of the palace and its surroundings, dated 1773 In 1719, the old Renaissance castle from the late 16th century was demolished. The newly appointed Privy Councillor Magnus Julius De la Gardie, who was in possession of a great fortune through his marriage to Hedvig Catharina Lillie, commissioned architect Joseph Gabriel Destain to design the present palace, built between 1720 and 1727. The courtyard is open to the sea and took on its present appearance in the 1820s. It is modelled on the garden of Log√•rden at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. In 1772, Tullgarn was acquired by the crown and became a royal residence. Occupancy was granted to Duke Fredrik Adolf, youngest brother of King Gustav III. Between 1778 and 1793, Frederick Adolf resided there with his lover Sophie Hagman, and many episodes from this period are preserved as the Tullgarnsmminnena, The Tullgarn memories.Carl Forsstrand : Sophie Hagman och hennes samtida. N√•gra anteckningar fr√•n det gustavianska Stockholm. (English: Sophie Hagman and her contemporaries. Notes from Stockholm during the Gustavian age\\") Second edition. Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm (1911) Frederick Adolf modernized the palace in neo classical style, adding another storey to the wings, giving the palace a flat Italian-style roof. Fredrik Adolf's interiors are some of the finest examples of Gustavian style in Sweden. Among the designers involved were Louis Masreliez, Jean Baptiste Masreliez, Per Ljung and Ernst Philip Thoman. Many of the interiors created at that time remain today in their original form. After the death of Frederick Adolf, it was granted to his sister, Princess Sophia Albertina, who spent all her summers her until her death in 1829. The following year, it was granted to the heir to the throne, the future Oscar I of Sweden, and served as the summer residence of the Swedish royal court during his reign. King Gustaf V (then Crown Prince) took over Tullgarn in 1881 and together with his consort Victoria, implemented extensive changes. The main building was decorated more like a modern functional summer home then a royal pleasure palace. Much of the present interior dates from the time of King Gustav V and Queen Viktoria, including the vestibule, whose walls are covered in hand-painted Dutch tiles. The breakfast room is furnished like a south German Bierstube, possibly reflecting the fact that Queen Viktoria came from Baden in Southern Germany. The royal couple used the palace as their summer residence. In 1924, Ethiopian Crown Prince Ras Tafari (later Emperor Haile Selassie) stayed at Tullgarn while touring Europe.The Autobiography of Emperor Haile Selassie vol I, p.xxiv Notes  References  * Fredric Bedoire, Svenska slott och herrg√•rdar, Stockholm : Bonnier, 2006, .

It converts oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide. It is found in two forms, cytosolic and mitochondrial.  Structure  In humans there are two isoforms of PEPCK; a cytosolic form (SwissProt P35558) and a mitochondrial isoform (SwissProt Q16822) which have 63.4% sequence identity. The cytosolic form is important in gluconeogenesis. However, there is a known transport mechanism to move PEP from the mitochondria to the cytosol, using specific membrane transport proteins. PEP transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane involves the mitochondrial tricarboxylate transport protein and to a lesser extent the adenine nucleotide carrier. The possibility of a PEP/pyruvate transporter has also been put forward. X-ray structures of PEPCK provide insight into the structure and the mechanism of PEPCK enzymatic activity. The mitochondrial isoform of chicken liver PEPCK complexed with Mn2+, Mn2+-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and Mn2+-GDP provides information about its structure and how this enzyme catalyzes reactions. Delbaere et al. (2004) resolved PEPCK in E. coli and found the active site sitting between a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain. The active site was observed to be closed upon rotation of these domains. Phosphoryl groups are transferred during PEPCK action, which is likely facilitated by the eclipsed conformation of the phosphoryl groups when ATP is bound to PEPCK. Since the eclipsed formation is one that is high in energy, phosphoryl group transfer has a decreased energy of activation, meaning that the groups will transfer more readily. This transfer likely happens via a mechanism similar to SN2 displacement. =In different species= PEPCK gene transcription occurs in many species, and the amino acid sequence of PEPCK is distinct for each species. For example, its structure and its specificity differ in humans, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi. Mechanism PEPCase converts oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide. Image:Oxaloacetic acid.pngoxaloacetate Image:Phosphoenolpyruvic acid.svgphosphoenolpyruvate As PEPCK acts at the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, it causes decarboxylation of a C4 molecule, creating a C3 molecule. As the first committed step in gluconeogenesis, PEPCK decarboxylates and phosphorylates oxaloacetate (OAA) for its conversion to PEP, when GTP is present. As a phosphate is transferred, the reaction results in a GDP molecule. When pyruvate kinase ‚Äì the enzyme that normally catalyzes the reaction that converts PEP to pyruvate ‚Äì is knocked out in mutants of Bacillus subtilis, PEPCK participates in one of the replacement anaplerotic reactions, working in the reverse direction of its normal function, converting PEP to OAA. Although this reaction is possible, the kinetics are so unfavorable that the mutants grow at a very slow pace or do not grow at all.  Function  =Gluconeogenesis= PEPCK-C catalyzes an irreversible step of gluconeogenesis, the process whereby glucose is synthesized. The enzyme has therefore been thought to be essential in glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by laboratory mice that contracted diabetes mellitus type 2 as a result of the overexpression of PEPCK-C.Vanderbilt Medical Center. \\"Granner Lab, PEPCK Research.\\" 2001. Online. Internet. Accessed 10:46PM, 4/13/07. www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vumc.php?site=granner&doc;=119 The role that PEPCK-C plays in gluconeogenesis may be mediated by the citric acid cycle, the activity of which was found to be directly related to PEPCK-C abundance. PEPCK-C levels alone were not highly correlated with gluconeogenesis in the mouse liver, as previous studies have suggested. While the mouse liver almost exclusively expresses PEPCK-C, humans equally present a mitochondrial isozyme (PEPCK-M). PEPCK-M has gluconeogenic potential per se. Therefore, the role of PEPCK-C and PEPCK-M in gluconeogenesis may be more complex and involve more factors than was previously believed. =Animals= In animals, this is a rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, the process by which cells synthesize glucose from metabolic precursors. The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in glucose homeostasis, over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far the most common form of diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood glucose homeostasis, a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis. PEPCK-C is controlled by two different hormonal mechanisms. PEPCK-C activity is increased upon the secretion of both cortisol from the adrenal cortex and glucagon from the alpha cells of the pancreas. Glucagon indirectly elevates the expression of PEPCK-C by increasing the levels of cAMP (via activation of adenylyl cyclase) in the liver which consequently leads to the phosphorylation of S133 on a beta sheet in the CREB protein. CREB then binds upstream of the PEPCK-C gene at CRE (cAMP response element) and induces PEPCK-C transcription. Cortisol on the other hand, when released by the adrenal cortex, passes through the lipid membrane of liver cells (due to its hydrophobic nature it can pass directly through cell membranes) and then binds to a Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). This receptor dimerizes and the cortisol/GR complex passes into the nucleus where it then binds to the Glucocorticoid Response Element (GRE) region in a similar manner to CREB and produces similar results (synthesis of more PEPCK-C). Together, cortisol and glucagon can have huge synergistic results, activating the PEPCK-C gene to levels that neither cortisol or glucagon could reach on their own. PEPCK-C is most abundant in the liver, kidney, and adipose tissue. A collaborative study between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the University of New Hampshire investigated the effect of DE-71, a commercial PBDE mixture, on PEPCK enzyme kinetics and determined that in vivo treatment of the environmental pollutant compromises liver glucose and lipid metabolism possibly by activation of the pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), and may influence whole-body insulin sensitivity. Researchers at Case Western Reserve University have discovered that overexpression of cytosolic PEPCK in skeletal muscle of mice causes them to be more active, more aggressive, and have longer lives than normal mice; see metabolic supermice. =Plants= PEPCK () is one of three decarboxylation enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and NAD- malic enzyme. In C4 carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is first fixed by combination with phosphoenolpyruvate to form oxaloacetate in the mesophyll. In PEPCK-type C4 plants the oxaloacetate is then converted to aspartate, which travels to the bundle sheath. In the bundle sheath cells, aspartate is converted back to oxaloacetate. PEPCK decarboxylates the bundle sheath oxaloacetate, releasing carbon dioxide, which is then fixed by the enzyme Rubisco. For each molecule of carbon dioxide produced by PEPCK, a molecule of ATP is consumed. PEPCK acts in plants that undergo C4 carbon fixation, where its action has been localized to the cytosol, in contrast to mammals, where it has been found that PEPCK works in mitochondria. Although it is found in many different parts of plants, it has been seen only in specific cell types, including the areas of the phloem. It has also been discovered that, in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), PEPCK levels are increased by multiple effects that are known to decrease the cellular pH of plants, although these effects are specific to the part of the plant. PEPCK levels rose in roots and stems when the plants were watered with ammonium chloride at a low pH (but not at high pH), or with butyric acid. However, PEPCK levels did not increase in leaves under these conditions. In leaves, 5% CO2 content in the atmosphere leads to higher PEPCK abundance. =Bacteria= In an effort to explore the role of PEPCK, researchers caused the overexpression of PEPCK in E. coli bacteria via recombinant DNA. PEPCK of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to trigger the immune system in mice by increasing cytokine activity. As a result, it has been found that PEPCK may be an appropriate ingredient in the development of an effective subunit vaccination for tuberculosis. Clinical significance = Activity in cancer = PEPCK has not been considered in cancer research until recently. It has been shown that in human tumor samples and human cancer cell lines (breast, colon and lung cancer cells) PEPCK-M, and not PEPCK-C, was expressed at enough levels to play a relevant metabolic role. Therefore, PEPCK-M could have a role in cancer cells, especially under nutrient limitation or other stress conditions. Regulation =In humans= PEPCK-C is enhanced, both in terms of its production and activation, by many factors. Transcription of the PEPCK-C gene is stimulated by glucagon, glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), while it is inhibited by insulin. Of these factors, insulin, a hormone that is deficient in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, is considered dominant, as it inhibits the transcription of many of the stimulatory elements. PEPCK activity is also inhibited by hydrazine sulfate, and the inhibition therefore decreases the rate of gluconeogenesis. In prolonged acidosis, PEPCK-C is upregulated in renal proximal tubule brush border cells, in order to secrete more NH3 and thus to produce more HCO3‚àí. The GTP-specific activity of PEPCK is highest when Mn2+ and Mg2+ are available. In addition, hyper-reactive cysteine (C307) is involved in the binding of Mn2+ to the active site. =Plants= As discussed previously, PEPCK abundance increased when plants were watered with low-pH ammonium chloride, though high pH did not have this effect.

It is a characteristic tree of the Afromontane flora. Description Juniperus procera is a medium-sized tree reaching 20‚Äì25 m (rarely 40 m) tall, with a trunk up to 1.5‚Äì2 m diameter and a broadly conical to rounded or irregular crown. The leaves are of two forms, juvenile needle- like leaves 8‚Äì15 mm long on seedlings, and adult scale-leaves 0.5‚Äì3 mm long on older plants, arranged in decussate pairs or whorls of three. It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some individual plants produce both sexes. The cones are berry-like, 4‚Äì8 mm in diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2‚Äì5 seeds; they are mature in 12‚Äì18 months. The male cones are 3‚Äì5 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring.(Page archived by the Wayback Machine). Distribution Juniperus procera is native to the Arabian Peninsula (in Saudi Arabia and Yemen), and northeastern, eastern, west-central, and south tropical Africa (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Republic of the Congo; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Kenya; Malawi; Mozambique; Somalia; Sudan; Tanzania; Uganda; Zambia; and Zimbabwe). It is the only juniper to occur south of the equator, and is thought to be a relatively recent colonist of Africa; the species shows very little of the variability associated with a long period of evolution. It is closely related to Juniperus excelsa from southwestern Asia, probably deriving from a common ancestor with that species in southwestern Asia. Taxonomy According to Tropicos, Juniperus procera was originally described and published in Synopsis Coniferarum 1847. The type specimen was collected from Ethiopia, by \\"Schimper\\" (possibly Wilhelm Philipp Schimper, but there were other contemporary collectors with this surname).Original description by Uses It is an important timber tree, used for building houses, for poles, for furniture; bark used for beehives.http://database.prota.org/dbtw- wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?ac=qbe_query&bu;=http://database.prota.org/search.htm&tn;=protab~1&qb0;=and&qf0;=Species+Code&qi0;=Juniperus+procera&rf;=Webdisplay File:Juniperus procera 2.jpgEast African juniper, northern Tanzania File:Juniperus procera 3.jpgEast African juniper, northern Tanzania File:Juniperus procera cones.JPGEast African juniper, northern Tanzania File:Juniperus procera fence stakes.JPGEast African juniper, used as termite resistant fence stakes References Further reading *Adams, R.

Moving to London, he quickly established himself as the leading theatrical architect, building, in rapid succession, the Queen's Theatre (1867), the Gaiety Theatre (1868), the Olympic Theatre (1870) and the Vaudeville Theatre (1871). Phipps designed the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin for John and Michael Gunn, opened in November 1871. Phipps's Savoy Theatre (1881), a state-of-the-art facility, was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electric light.Burgess, Michael. \\"Richard D'Oyly Carte\\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7‚Äì11 Other major London theatres included the Strand (1882), the Prince's (1884), the Lyric (1888), the original Shaftesbury Theatre (1888), the Garrick (1889), the Tivoli (1890) and Daly's (1893). In addition to Phipps's London theatres, he was responsible for over forty theatres in the provinces. He also designed Leinster Hall in Dublin for Michael Gunn (opened in 1886 and closed in 1895), the Star and Garter Hotel at Richmond (demolished in 1919) and the Savoy Turkish Bath. Phipps was chosen to design the Royal Institute of British Architects‚Äô own premises at 9 Conduit Street. The building is still there, though no longer occupied by the RIBA (now in Portland Place) and is considered by some to reflect the influence of the architect's native town. He was a fellow (1866) of the Royal Institute of British Architects, serving on its council in 1875‚Äì6, and also of the Society of Antiquaries. Phipps died on 25 May 1897, aged 62. Family On 10 April 1860, he married Miss Honnor Hicks, by whom he had two sons and three daughters. For some time previous to his death he had been associated in partnership with his son-in-law, Arthur Blomfield Jackson.

Some countries eat cat meat regularly, whereas others have only consumed some cat meat in desperation during wartime or poverty. Africa Prehistoric human feces have contained bones from the wild cat of Africa. In some cultures of Cameroon, there is a special ceremony featuring cat-eating that is thought to bring good luck. Asia Cats at a cat meat restaurant =China= In Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in south-eastern China, some‚Äîespecially older‚Äîpeople consider cat flesh a good warming food during winter months. It is estimated that in southern China's Guangdong province (population just over 113 million) people eat 10,000 cats per day. In Guangdong, cat meat is a main ingredient in the traditional dish \\"dragon, tiger, phoenix\\" (snake, cat, chicken), which is said to fortify the body.Some call it an indelicate trade, others, a delicacy , Xinhuanet.com, 13 Jan 2012 (from China Daily) Organized cat-collectors supply the southern restaurants with animals that often originate in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. On 26 January 2010, China launched its first draft proposal to protect the country's animals from maltreatment including a measure to jail people‚Äîfor periods up to 15 days‚Äîfor eating cat or dog meat. With the increase of cats as pets in China, opposition towards the traditional use of cats for food has grown. In June 2006, approximately 40 activists stormed the Fangji Cat Meatball Restaurant in Shenzhen, forcing it to shut down. Expanded to more than 40 member societies, the Chinese Animal Protection Network in January 2006 began organizing well-publicized protests against dog and cat consumption, starting in Guangzhou, following up in more than ten other cities \\"with very optimal response from public.\\" =Japan= In Japan, cat meat was consumed until the end of the Tokugawa period in the 19th century. =Korea= In Korea, cat meat was historically brewed into a tonic as a folk remedy for neuralgia and arthritis, not commonly as food. Modern consumption is seen and more likely to be in the form of cat soup. = Taiwan = In October 2017, Taiwan's national legislature, known as Legislative Yuan, passed amendments to the country's Animal Protection Act which \\"bans the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat and of any food products that contain the meat or other parts of these animals.\\" =Vietnam= As of 2015, cat meat is eaten in Vietnam, even though it is technically illegal.Vi·ªát B√°o Th·ªãt m√®o It is generally seen on menus with the euphemism \\"ti·ªÉu h·ªï\\", literally \\"baby tiger\\" rather than the literal \\"th·ªãt m√®o\\". Cat galls have aphrodisiacal properties according to people in North Vietnam. In 2018, however, officials in the city of Hanoi urged citizens to stop eating dog and cat meat, citing concerns about the cruel methods with which the animals are slaughtered and the diseases this practice propagates, including rabies and leptospirosis. The primary reason for this exhortation seems to be a fear that the practice of dog and cat consumption, most of which are stolen household pets, could tarnish the city's image as a \\"civilised and modern capital\\". According to data from a market research study by Four Paws, approximately 8% of people living in Hanoi have consumed cat meat in their lives. Europe =Switzerland= According to the Food Safety and Veterinary Office, the sale of dog or cat meat is not allowed, but it is legal for people to eat their own animals. The Swiss parliament rejected changing the laws to protect dogs and cats for human consumption in 1993. =Denmark= In June 2008, three students at the Danish School of Media and Journalism published pictures of a cat being slaughtered and eaten in Citat, a magazine for journalism students. Their goal was to create a debate about animal welfare. The cat was shot by its owner, a farmer, and it would have been put down in any case. The farmer slaughtered the cat within the limits of Danish law. This led to criticism from Danish animal welfare group Dyrenes Beskyttelse, and death threats received by the students. =United Kingdom= In 18th-century Britain, there are a few records of cats being eaten as a form of entertainment. =Italy= In February 2010, on a television cooking show, the Italian food writer Beppe Bigazzi mentioned that during the famine in World War II cat stew was a \\"succulent\\" and well-known dish in his home area of Valdarno, Tuscany. Later he claimed he had been joking, but added that cats used to be eaten in the area during famine periods, historically. He was widely criticised in the media for his comments and ultimately dropped from the television network. Cat consumption is a stereotype attributed to Vincenzans in Vicenza, Italy. According to the British Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant of 1904, \\"Just before Christmas it is common for a group of young men in northern Italy to kill some cats, skin them and soak them in water for two or three days. They are cooked with great care on Christmas day and served up hot about 1.30 P. M., after mass....Many people in Italy, 'on the quiet,' keep cats like the English do rabbits‚Äîto kill. A catskin there is worth ten pence, as the material for muffs for girls... Extraordinary care has to be taken in procuring the animals, for the Italian Society for the Protection of Cats is vigilant, and offenses against the law are followed by imprisonment only. We have no fines in Italy.\\" According to The Dietetic & Hygienic Gazette in 1905, \\"Italy cultivates the cat for home consumption as English people raise rabbits. It is to be done on the quiet, however, for in spite of the profit in the business and the demand for the delicacy, the law has to be looked out for, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Cats is vigilant. Offenses against the law are visited with imprisonment. Cats are raised for the market nonetheless. Fattened on the finest of milk, a choice specimen will attain the weight of fifteen pounds.\\" =France and Spain= There are accounts of cat being consumed in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (southern France), in Spain in the 17th century, and during WWI and WWII. =Other areas= Cats were sometimes eaten as a famine food during harsh winters, poor harvests, and wartime. Cat gained notoriety as \\"roof rabbit\\" in Central Europe's hard times during and between World War I and World War II. Oceania =Australia= Indigenous Australians in the area of Alice Springs roast feral cats on an open fire. They have also developed recipes for cat stew. Some other inhabitants of the area have also taken up this custom, justified on the grounds that felines are \\"a serious threat to Australia's native fauna\\". Scientists warned that eating wild cats could expose humans to harmful bacteria and toxins. The Americas =Peru= Cat is not a regular menu item in Peru, but is used in such dishes as fricassee and stews most abundant in two specific sites in the country: the southern town of Chincha Alta (Ica Region, Afro-Peruvian mostly) and the north-central Andean town of Huari (Ancash Region). Primarily used by Afro-Peruvians. Cat cooking techniques are demonstrated every September during the festival of Saint Efigenia in a town of La Quebrada. In October 2013, a judge banned the annual El Festival Gastronomico del Gato (the Gastronomic Festival of the Cat), which was held every September in La Quebrada to commemorate the arrival of settlers who were forced to eat cats to survive, citing it as cruel to the 100+ cats specifically bred for the event, which involves being kept in cages for a year prior the Festival. The judge also cited concerns over the safety of the meat, which drew criticism from residents who contend that cat meat is far richer than rabbit or duck, and that it has been long consumed globally without any deleterious effects.Golgowksi, Nina (October 15, 2013). \\"Judge bans Peruvian town's annual cat-eating festival\\". Daily News (New York). That same month, magistrate Maria Luyo banned the festival of Curru√±ao in the small town of San Luis. Locals say that the festival, which sees cats being drowned, skinned and tied to fireworks and blown up, dates back to the practice of eating cat on the part of African slaves who worked on sugar-cane plantations in colonial times, and is part of the religious celebrations of Santa Efigenia, an African-Peruvian folk saint. Luyo stated in her ruling that the festival \\"fomented violence based on cruel acts against animals which caused grave social damage and damaged public health\\", and that minors could be \\"psychologically damaged\\" by watching the events.Collyns, Dan (October 18, 2013). \\"Claws out as Peruvian judge suspends annual cat race and feast\\". The Guardian. =The United States= In December of 2018, the Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act of 2018 was signed into federal law making the consumption of cat meat illegal and punishable by a fine of $5000, except as part of Native American religious ceremonies. Previous to that bill, consuming cat meat was technically legal in 44 states.  Religion  = Islam = Islamic dietary laws forbid the consumption of cat meat as it is a terrestrial predator. = Judaism = Like Islam, Judaism also forbids consuming cat meat as it is a predator. As well as not being a predator, a mammal must both chew cud and have cloven hooves in order to be considered kosher.

Although the FCC record lists it in Southampton, New York, its studios, antenna and mailing address are by the East Hampton Airport in Wainscott, New York in East Hampton near the Southampton border. The station claims to be the largest FCC-licensed station in Suffolk County, New York. In addition to its network programming, WVVH-CD also shows local programming, such as the Hampton Classic Horse Show, Hamptons International Film Festival, and the Bridgehampton Road Rally, as well as the talk show In The Mixx, which premiered in summer 2012. At one time, WVVH maintained a local newscast, but eventually began carrying INN News. WVVH also carried the syndicated The Daily Buzz program on weekday mornings. History Founded in 1983, WVVH was originally a translator station for its first 10 years. Brothers Greg Schimizzi (a Brooklyn psychologist) and Ernie Schimizzi, doing business as Video Voice, launched the station on October 4, 1994. WVVH- LP originally broadcast on channel 23. In 2001, WVVH-LP moved to channel 50 since WFTY-TV would be broadcasting their digital signal on channel 23 and would cause potential interference to WVVH. In 2004, the station began webcasting its programming online. The station changed its call letters to WVVH-CA on April 15, 2008. The change reflected its change from a Low-power broadcasting (LP) station to a Class A television service (CA). On November 15, 2005, the station applied for a construction permit to begin digital broadcasting on their existing channel 50. The station changed its call sign again on October 21, 2011 to the current WVVH-CD. In 2007 a consortium from its home base in the Hampton bought Resort Sports Network with an eye towards expanding the network's shows with broadcasts from WVVH about the lifestyles options at resorts.

It is specifically adapted to elicit symptoms of a possible heart attack. Each letter stands for an important line of questioning for the patient assessment. This is usually taken along with vital signs and the SAMPLE history and would usually be recorded by the person delivering the aid, such as in the \\"Subjective\\" portion of a SOAP note, for later reference. \\"PQRST\\" (onset \\"O\\") is sometimes used in conjunction. The term \\"OPQRST-AAA\\" adds \\"aggravating/alleviating factors\\", \\"associated symptoms\\", and \\"attributions/adaptations\\". Use The parts of the mnemonic are: ;Onset of the event :What the patient was doing when it started (active, inactive, stressed, etc.), whether the patient believes that activity prompted the pain, and whether the onset was sudden, gradual or part of an ongoing chronic problem. ;Provocation or palliation :Whether any movement, pressure (such as palpation) or other external factor makes the problem better or worse. This can also include whether the symptoms relieve with rest. ;Quality of the pain :This is the patient's description of the pain. Questions can be open ended (\\"Can you describe it for me?\\") or leading. Ideally, this will elicit descriptions of the patient's pain: whether it is sharp, dull, crushing, burning, tearing, or some other feeling, along with the pattern, such as intermittent, constant, or throbbing. ;Region and radiation :Where the pain is on the body and whether it radiates (extends) or moves to any other area. This can give indications for conditions such as a myocardial infarction, which can radiate through the jaw and arms. Other referred pains can provide clues to underlying medical causes. ;Severity :The pain score (usually on a scale of 0 to 10). Zero is no pain and ten is the worst possible pain. This can be comparative (such as \\"... compared to the worst pain you have ever experienced\\") or imaginative (\\"... compared to having your arm ripped off by an alien\\"). If the pain is compared to a prior event, the nature of that event may be a follow-up question. The clinician must decide whether a score given is realistic within their experience ‚Äì for instance, a pain score 10 for a stubbed toe is likely to be exaggerated. This may also be assessed for pain now, compared to pain at time of onset, or pain on movement. There are alternative assessment methods for pain, which can be used where a patient is unable to vocalise a score. One such method is the Wong-Baker faces pain scale. ;Time (history) :How long the condition has been going on and how it has changed since onset (better, worse, different symptoms), whether it has ever happened before, whether and how it may have changed since onset, and when the pain stopped if it is no longer currently being felt.

Little is known of his life and works, except that he is mentioned in all the traditional accounts (Shankara Vijayams) as the teacher of Adi Shankara. He was the disciple of Gaudapada (IAST '). He is mentioned in the first verse of Adi Shankara's Prakara≈Üa grantha (treatise) Viveka Chudamani. He is named after Gaudapada in the Guru Parampara (lineage) of Sringeri Sharada Peetham.. He is considered to be an incarnation of Shesha. Meeting Adi Shankara :See Life of Adi Shankara for the biography of Adi Shankara As per the Madhavƒ´ya Shankaravijaya, after leaving Kerala, Adi Shankara reached the banks of the river Narmada where he met Govinda Bhagavatpada at Omkareshwar. The Madhavƒ´ya Shankaravijaya states that Adi Shankara once calmed a flood from the River Narmada by placing his kaman·∏çalu (water pot) in the path of the raging water, thus saving his Guru Govinda Bhagavatpada who was immersed in SamƒÅdhi in a cave nearby. The cave is still maintained in Omkareshwar below the famous Shiva temple. Govinda Bhagavatpada is said to have asked Adi Shankara who he was. Adi Shankara then replied with a verse (which are known as Atma Shatkam or Nirvana Shatkam) composed extempore, that brought out clearly the Advaita philosophy in regard to the Self. Shankara was then initiated as Govinda Bhagavatapada's disciple, thus formally entering sanyasa. Adi Shankara was then commissioned by his Guru to write a Bhashya (commentary) on the Brahma Sutra and spread the Advaita philosophy far and wide. Gaudapadacharya was the guru of Govinda Bhagavatpada.

The area is predominantly a housing area, but has a large area of recreational land for the general public. Palm or Palmers Bay is one of many bays round the coast of Thanet. Palm Bay lies between Walpole and Botany Bays and is popular as a centre for Jet Skiing, the eastern end of Palm Bay is also known as Forness Bay and is the home to a local water skiing club. The original Palm Bay estate was built in the 1930s as a number of large, wide avenues with detached and semi-detached houses with driveways, garages and gardens. This land was sold by Mr Sidney Simon Van Den Bergh to the Palm Bay Estate Co on 23 June 1924. Such avenues include Gloucester Avenue and Leicester Avenue. The estate covers the eastern part of Cliftonville and was fields when the first was built. It extends east beyond Northumberland Avenue and has been developed in phases. An earlier phase covered the northern ends of Leicester and Gloucester Avenues and the whole of Clarence and Magnolia Avenues; the later phase extending eastwards of Princess Margaret Avenue is a Wimpy style housing estate with small houses largely identical in appearance and of less substantial build quality than the original 1930s estate.

Binnie is an out and proud lesbian, which is in stark contrast to her shy and retiring girlfriend, Della Alexander (Michelle Joseph). Storylines Binnie arrives in Albert Square in June 1994. She is the secret girlfriend of hairdresser Della Alexander (Michelle Joseph). Whilst Della prefers to keep her sexuality hidden, Binne is out and proud and wants everyone to know. She refuses to put up with anyone's bigotry and defends her choice of lifestyle to anyone that dares to pass judgement. Della had been in Walford for a few months before Binnie's arrival, and in this time she'd sparked up a close, flirtatious relationship with the barman, Steve Elliot (Mark Monero). Steve has become a partner in Della's hair salon and has begun to think that he and Della will soon be more than just friends. Binnie is adamant that Della should tell Steve about her sexuality, but Della finds the prospect of 'coming out' extremely daunting. Several days later, the situation is brought to a head prematurely, when Steve accidentally walks in on Della and Binnie in bed together. Steve is furious, as he feels Della has been leading him on. He throws her out of his home, prompting several arguments between him and Binnie. Steve and Binnie are sworn enemies thereafter, although they do manage to put aside their differences later in the year. Binnie and Della soon move into a bedsit on the Square and Binnie gets a job working as a barmaid in The Queen Victoria public house alongside Steve. She and Steve bicker constantly, mainly because Steve refuses to accept that Della is gay and regularly tries it on with her, leaving Binnie fuming with jealousy. More problems arise when Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) hears a rumour that Binnie and Della are lesbians. She starts telling anyone who cares to listen about how disgusting and unnatural the pair are. This reaction increases Della's trepidation about living as a lesbian and she starts denying the rumours; claiming that she'd never slept with a woman before in her life. Infuriated by Della's shame, Binnie threatens to leave the Square, which forces Della to prioritise. In order to convince Binnie to stay, Della kisses her in the middle of Bridge Street, which really gives the gossips something to talk about. Binnie spends most of her time on the Square trying to force Della to conform to her lesbian ideals. She regularly pressurises her to 'come out' to her mother and generally bosses her around making demands, which often causes blazing rows between them. Despite this, Binnie usually has Della's best interests at heart and the two genuinely love each other. In 1995 Binnie and Della decide that they have had enough of Walford and they decide to make a new start of things in Ibiza. They both depart in May 1995. Character creation and development Binnie and her girlfriend Della Alexander were the first lesbian couple to be featured in EastEnders. Their inclusion was an attempt to portray positive examples of characters who just happen to be homosexual. Their lesbian kiss accounted for some 45 percent of viewer complaints to the BBC regarding EastEnders in 1994; provoking more complaints than any other television programme that year (according to research published by the Broadcasting Standards Council in 1995).\\"Broadcast Concerns 1994-1995\\", Broadcasting Standards Council.

In 1995, bisexual actress Pam St. Clement, who plays Pat Evans, was asked if EastEnders' first lesbian storyline suffered from \\"seeming to follow the pack rather than lead it\\". She commented, \\"I think they realised there was something missing, but having given themselves that brief they didn't know what the fuck to do with it. I think Michael Cashman made Colin Russell so successful because he is a gay man. I'd never argue for somebody having to be a part to do it - you don't have to be a murderer to play Othello - and I think the two young girls [who played Della and Binnie] did what they could, but they couldn't really give the programme any help.\\" See also *List of LGBT characters in television *List of soap operas with LGBT characters References Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television ","title":"Binnie Roberts"},{"id":"5625857","text":"Souleymane Camara (born 22 December 1982) is a retired Senegalese footballer who played as a forward.

The oldest known mention of Pniewy comes from 1256, and town rights were probably granted in the late 13th century. Pniewy's name probably comes from the Polish word pie≈Ñ, which means \\"trunk\\", which is also depicted in the town's coat of arms. Pniewy was a private town held by various Polish noble families, the first of which was the Na≈Çƒôcz family, later known as the Pniewski family of Na≈Çƒôcz coat of arms. Administratively it was located in the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The town suffered during the 17th and 18th century wars, however it was revived thanks to the Szo≈Çdryscy family, and local guilds were granted several privileges. 19th-century view of the local palace In 1793 it was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland, in 1807 regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 re-annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 to 1918 was also part of Germany. The population took part in Polish uprisings of 1830‚Äì1831 and 1848. The town was subjected to Anti-Polish policies including Germanisation, however it remained a center of Polish resistance, and Poles established various organizations. In November 1918, after World War I, Poland regained independence, and in December 1918, local Poles liberated the town from the Germans, and it was re-integrated with Poland. Local Poles took part in multiple battles of the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì19), in which 18 of them were killed.

Since 1969, he has taught, and published on, 19th century literature, critical theory, and film in the UCLA Department of French and Francophone studies. Gans invented a new science of human culture and origins he calls Generative Anthropology, based on the idea that the origin of language was a singular event and that the history of human culture is a genetic or \\"generative\\" development of that event. In a series of books and articles beginning with The Origin of Language: A Formal Theory of Representation (1981) Gans has developed his ideas about human culture, language, and origins. In 1995, Gans founded (and continues to edit) the web-based journal Anthropoetics: The Journal of Generative Anthropology as a scholarly forum for research into human culture and origins based on Generative Anthropology and the closely related Fundamental Anthropology of Ren√© Girard. Since 1995, Gans has web-published his \\"Chronicles of Love and Resentment\\", consisting of reflections on everything from popular culture, film, post-modernism, economics, contemporary politics, the Holocaust, philosophy, religion, and paleoanthropology. In 2010, the Generative Anthropology Society & Conference was created for sponsoring annual conferences dedicated to Generative Anthropology. Generative Anthropology =Background= Generative Anthropology grew out of Gans' association with Girard at Johns Hopkins University. Gans was Girard‚Äôs first doctoral student, receiving his PhD in 1966. But it was only on the publication of Violence and the Sacred in 1972 that Gans became interested in Girard's idea of mimetic desire and the connection between violence and the sacred in Girard's work. The concept of mimetic desire forms one of the cornerstones of Generative Anthropology. Girard argues that human desire is essentially cultural or social in nature, and thus distinct from mere appetite, which is biological. For Girard, desire is triangular in structure, an imitation of the desire of another. Desire, therefore, leads to conflict, when two individuals attempt to possess the same object. In a group, this mimetic conflict typically escalates into a mimetic crisis which threatens the very existence of the group. For Girard, this conflict is resolved by the scapegoat mechanism, in which the destructive energies of the group are purged through the violence directed towards an arbitrarily selected victim. Girard sees the scapegoating mechanism as the origin of human culture and language. =The Originary Hypothesis= Gans agrees with Girard that human language originates in the context of a mimetic crisis, but he does not find the scapegoat mechanism, by itself, as an adequate explanation for the origin of language. Gans hypothesizes that language originates in \\"an aborted gesture of appropriation,\\" which signifies the desired object as sacred and which memorializes the birth of language, serving as the basis for rituals which recreate the originary event symbolically. The originary sign serves to defer the mimetic violence threatening the group, hence Gans's capsule definition of culture as \\"the deferral of violence through representation.\\" For a more detailed explanation of the originary hypothesis, see Generative Anthropology. =The Scene of Representation= For Gans, language is essentially \\"scenic\\" in character, that is, structurally defined by a sacred center and human periphery. In the secular culture which develops later, \\"significance\\" serves as an attenuated form of the sacred. The scene of representation is a true cultural universal and the basic model for cultural analysis. Generative Anthropology attempts to understand the various means by which transcendence or meaning (which is always ethically functional) is created on a scene of representation. Life and education Eric Lawrence Gans was born in Bronx, New York on August 21, 1941. He went to Columbia University at the age of 16 and received a B.A. in French (Summa cum laude) in 1960. Going on to graduate work in Romance languages at Johns Hopkins University, he received his M.A. in 1961 and a Ph.D (with Distinction) in 1966. After two years as an Assistant Professor at Indiana University, he moved to the Dept. of French at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1969, where he became full professor in 1976. In 1978, he served at Johns Hopkins University as a visiting Professor. From 2007-2014 he was honored as a Distinguished Professor at UCLA until he resigned after being found in violation of the UCLA sexual misconduct policy. Since 2015, he is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at UCLA but is forbidden to teach or advise students. Sexual harassment allegations In 2015, Gans was found guilty of violating the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and the Faculty Code of Conduct. In 2011-2012, Gans began sending unwanted and unsolicited emails to his female graduate student, professing his love for her. Gans acknowledged the feelings were one-sided: ‚ÄúThere is no doubt an asymmetry in our affection.‚Äù According to the results of the Title IX investigation launched in response to the student's complaints, Gans continued his advancements after his student repeatedly tried to get him to cease. Gans, however, denied his advances were unwanted in an interview with The Daily Californian:‚ÄúI‚Äôm an old-fashioned guy. I treat women with a kind of reverence. Some women appreciate this, but some don‚Äôt.‚Äù Gans alleged the Title IX was a set-up orchestrated by the department chair and described his former student as ‚Äú[...] a weak person, she was intimidated by them, (and) she wasn‚Äôt the best student.\\"  Critics  The main source of criticism directed against Gans's work comes from Girard himself, who claims that Generative Anthropology is just another version of social contract theories of origins. Gans has responded to Girard's criticisms and defended his theory in his books and articles. Others take issue with Gans' conservative political views as expressed in his Chronicles of Love and Resentment. Gans has entered into constructive conversation with contrasting views on Middle Eastern politics in his published dialogue with Ammar Abdulhamid: A Dialogue on the Middle East and Other Subjects. Generative Anthropology Society & Conference The Generative Anthropology Society & Conference (GASC) is a scholarly association formed for the purpose of facilitating intellectual exchange amongst those interested in fundamental reflection on the human, originary thinking, and Generative Anthropology, including support for regular conferences. GASC was formally organized on June 24, 2010 at Westminster College, Salt Lake City during the 4th Annual Generative Anthropology Summer Conference. Further information, including how to join, can be found at the Generative Anthropology Society & Conference Website. Since 2007, Generative Anthropology Society & Conference (GASC) has held an annual summer conference on Generative Anthropology. 2007 - Kwantlen University College of University of British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia) 2008 - Chapman University (Orange, California) 2009 - University of Ottawa (Ottawa, Ontario) 2010 - Westminster College (Utah) (Salt Lake City) and Brigham Young University (Provo, Utah) 2011 - High Point University (High Point, North Carolina) 2012 - International Christian University (Tokyo, Japan) 2013 - University of California, Los Angeles 2014 - University of Victoria (Greater Victoria, British Columbia), Canada 2015 - High Point University (High Point, North Carolina) 2016 - Kinjo Gakuin University (Nagoya, Japan) Honors * Phi Beta Kappa (elected in junior year) * Woodrow Wilson fellow 1960-61 * Prix de la langue fran√ßaise - Acad√©mie fran√ßaise 1977 * Chevalier des Palmes Acad√©miques 1982 Bibliography =Books= *The Discovery of Illusion: Flaubert's Early Works, 1835-37.

It is on the west side of the Hayle Estuary, about southeast of St Ives and one mile (1.6 km) west of Hayle.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The village is part of St Ives civil parish (meaning that it falls within the parish area of St Ives Town Council) and also in St Ives Parliamentary constituency. The birth, marriage, and death registration district is Penzance. There is a ward (called Lelant and Carbis Bay). Its population at the 2011 census was 3,892 The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south west England from Somerset to Dorset passes through Lelant, along the estuary and above Porth Kidney Sands. History Sand dunes Near Lelant, Cornwall, by Walter Elmer Schofield Lelant Church The name is derived from the Cornish lann and Anta, meaning church-site of Anta. The earliest attested spelling is Lananta in about 1170.Archives of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, Number 3672.For further information about the forms of this place name see: Gover, J. E. B. (1948) The place names of Cornwall volume 6, pages 635-658 (typescript at the Royal Institution of Cornwall and reference copy at the Cornwall Record Office, Truro); research note books on Cornish place names of Oliver Padel (at the Institute of Cornish Studies, Tremough); and Nothing is known about Anta, and Lelant parish church is dedicated to St Uny.GENUKI website; Lelant. Retrieved April 2010. However, Carbis Bay church is dedicated to St Anta. Arthur Langdon (1896) records eight stone crosses in the parish, of which four are in the churchyard; the other crosses are at Brunian Cairn, Lelant Lane, Sea Lane and the churchtown.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard At one time Lelant was an important town and seaport having a market and a custom-house. A parish terrier of 1727 describing the bounds of the glebe land states that about 50 acres of land, and the vicarage, were overwhelmed by sand. The terrier does not give a date but does say that it was not in the living memory of man. In the spring of 1875, during the building of the railway line between St Erth railway station and St Ives, several human skeletons, graves and a building were found by a gang of navvies. Observers of the building thought it was of an ecclesiastical nature, and it is possible that it is the site of a pre-Norman church, burial ground and the former Lelant town. Lelant was formerly an ecclesiastical parish being the mother church of both Towednack and St Ives. The parish church of St Uny's Church, Lelant is situated at the east end of the village on the edge of the towans and overlooking the West Cornwall Golf Club. Lelant was a seaport in the Middle Ages, but the trade was lost to St Ives when the estuary silted up.

(1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 100 In 1831 it was reported that much granite was quarried here, and that there were several tin mines nearby. The family of Praed were landowners here for many centuries. The early 19th century politician and poet Winthrop Mackworth Praed was a member of the family, though he did not live in Cornwall. The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM. On 15 October 1878, the School Board Office of Uny Lelant advertised for tenders for the building of a school to accommodate 234 children. The architect was Silvanus Trevail of Tywardreath. The school, at Trevarrack, west of Lelant, is currently a public house. Transport St. Ives Bay Line running through the top of Porthkidney Beach The South West Coast Path overlooking Porth Kidney in 2008 (the South West Coast Path passes through Lelant, along the estuary and above Porth Kidney Sands) Lelant lies on the short A3074 road that leads to Carbis Bay and St Ives, just to the north of the main A30 after it bypasses Hayle and where it swings southwestwards across country towards Penzance on the south coast, about six miles away. The village is served by two railway stations on the St Ives branch. The original station, Lelant, was built by the Great Western Railway in 1877 to serve Lelant village. Lelant Saltings was built in 1978 as a park and ride station to relieve traffic congestion in St Ives and Carbis Bay. However, in June 2019, the park and ride facilities closed. The St Michael‚Äôs Way trail, established in 1994, starts at Lelant parish church and terminates later on the south coast at St Michael's Mount. The initial segment of this modern pilgrim route coincides with the South West Coast Path as far as the western end of Carbis Bay. Sport The West Cornwall Golf Club is situated to the east of the village overlooking St Ives Bay and Godrevy Island. It is the oldest golf club in Cornwall. St Ives Town play in the Cornwall Combination, a level 12 league in the English football league system. They play their home matches at the Saltings, which is between the village and Lelant Saltings railway station.

Vita Hludovici or Vita Hludovici Imperatoris (The Life of Louis or the Life of the Emperor Louis) is an anonymous biography of Louis the Pious, Holy Roman Emperor and King of the Franks from AD 814 to 840. Author The work was written in Latin in or soon after AD 840 by an anonymous author who is conventionally called Astronomus, the Astronomer or sometimes the Limousin Astronomer. This is due to his many detailed comments on astronomical matters in the work upon which he describes himself as \\"one credited with having knowledge of this subject.\\" He held office at the court of Louis the Pious, and his cultural and religious references suggest that he was not a churchman. It has been conjectured, based on evidence within the text, that the author was born around AD 800 and that his nationality was not Gothic or Frankish. The author's attitude to his subject is clearly subordinate and one of admiration, yet he does not idealise Louis in the same way as, for example, Einhard does in his Life of Charlemagne. It has been suggested that the author exhibits a degree of disapproval towards clerics and the workings of the Frankish Church, lending weight to the view that he was not formally connected to the Church. Nevertheless, the most popular recent ideas (see below) do identify him as a cleric. =Identification= Denier of Louis (20mm, 1.65 g, 1h). Uncertain mint. Struck 822-840 AD. Obverse: HLVDOVVICVS IMP, cross; pellet in each quarter. Reverse: XPISTIANA RELIGIO, temple; cross within.Various attempts have been made to identify the author with a particular individual. In 1729, Von Eckhart thought he was a notary attached to Louis' court between 816 and 839. Von Simson in 1909 attempted to identify him as Archdeacon Gerolt, a cleric at court. Max Buchner, the author of one of the most influential modern studies of the Astronomer's work in 1940, identified him as Hilduin, the chancellor of Pippin II of Aquitaine and Charles the Bald. Ernst Tremp supports this view in his important 1995 study, although Buchner and Tremp differ by about a decade in their dating of the work. Tischler has most recently tried to make a case that the Astronomer was Jonas of Orleans but the Hilduin theory remains more popular amongst historians. Recently, Courtney Booker suggested Walafrid Strabo was the Astronomer.

Created by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Scott McDaniel, he first appeared in Nightwing v2, #1 (Oct. 1996). Fictional character biography Inspector Dudley \\"Deadly\\" Soames was the dirtiest man working in the corrupted Bl√ºdhaven Police Department. He first met Nightwing when he was ordered by Delmore Redhorn, the Police Chief, to execute the young vigilante.Nighwing #2 Soames, however, betrayed Redhorn and allowed Nightwing to live, with the intention to pit various factions in Bl√ºdhaven against one another.Nighwing #3-5 He played both sides of the legal fence: he fed information on Blockbuster's criminal dealings to Nightwing, served Blockbuster as a mob lieutenant, and oversaw many of the criminal activities of Chief Redhorn's corrupt tenure with the police.Nighwing #2-9 After Soames' scheme to use Scarecrow against Nightwing failed disastrously,Nighwing 11-12 Blockbuster grew weary of his underling, and attempted to have him killed. Soames responded with surprising cunning, and ultimately tried to take Blockbuster's invalid mother hostage as part of a last bid for power. Nightwing attempted to intervene, but was forced to save innocent bystanders as Blockbuster twisted the dirty cop's head 180 degrees, leaving Soames for dead.Nighwing #13 However, Soames survived by sheer luck, as his windpipe remained undamaged long enough for him to be moved to life support. Although his neck was permanently twisted, thanks to a breakthrough medical technique, sophisticated micro-surgery was able to reattach his nerve endings so that he could move again. With control of his body restored but informed that it would be impossible to turn his head back the right way around, Soames spent some time retraining himself to move normally, \\"seeing through the back of his head\\" with the use of glasses with a built-in array of mirrors. Still disgusted at his new condition despite the doctor's assurances that everything that could be done had been done, Soames brutally killed the doctor that had saved his life, morbidly renamed himself Torque, and (gaining the support of Intergang) started a new gang war for the control of Bl√ºdhaven, revenge against Blockbuster, Nightwing, and the city he now felt he owned.Nighwing #16-23 Torque fights Nightwing and the vigilante \\"Nite-Wing\\" shortly after the assassination of Ricky Noone. Blockbuster is not pleased that there is a crime turf war without him.Nightwing #43 After descending further into madness, Soames was brought to justice by Nightwing, only to arrange a prison break with the help of the imprisoned vigilante Nite-Wing. This would prove his undoing, since once freed he wasted no time in returning to his old plans, even attempting to enlist Nite-Wing into his reign of terror. The vigilante, however, had a zero-tolerance policy for crime, and, upon realizing Soames' true nature, the two entered into a Mexican standoff that only Nite-Wing survived.Nighwing #77 In other media Torque briefly appears in Arrow season two finale \\"Unthinkable\\", portrayed by Michael Adamthwaite. After Amanda Waller orders a drone strike on Star City, John Diggle and Lyla Michaels release all of the Suicide Squad, including Torque, who then force Waller to stop the drone strike, which she eventually complies to. Though his real name is never stated, it is most likely the same one as his comic book counterpart.

He gained attention when he sued his university for alleged racial discrimination. Academic career Chun received a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, an M.A. in Geophysics at Columbia University and a Ph.D. at Berkeley. He joined the University of Toronto as a research associate in 1985. His research was in seismology. Chun was allegedly promised a tenure-track position with the department when he accepted. His duties matched or exceeded the senior professors of the department. Chun brought in $1.4 million in research grants, had 26 research publications in international journals, represented Canada at a United Nations conference, supervising graduate students, and teaching classes. As a research associate, he was not on the university's payroll. He depended upon research grants to fund his work and cover his living expenses as well. Chun remained a research associate for ten years, while being passed over for tenure four times. One time, when he applied, the other candidates were given a month to prepare for the presentation, while he was only given a few days. In another instance, Chris Chapman was selected over him but only stayed for a short time before leaving for the private sector, while the position was eliminated after his departure, leading to allegations that Chapman was given the job in order to preempt Chun from getting it. Up to 1992, as Full Member of the Graduate Faculty, Chun held the responsibilities of a professor, as he supervised graduate students and taught lectures, but not the pay and benefits that accompany such a position. In 1994, Chun complained to the Dean of Arts & Sciences, stating that he would commit suicide if the search process continued to be unfair, and his suicide threat would later be frequently used against him although Dr Chun maintained that his statement was clear hyperbole. The Dr. Chun Case Chun's dismissal soon drew nationwide media attention to his plight. He was supported by many student groups and the Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton. In June 1995, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) sent two members of the Academic Freedom and Tenure (AF&T;) Committee to the University of Toronto to investigate, and their report suggested a pattern of systematic discrimination. The AF&T; also made several recommendations, including allowing Chun to return to the university with a salary and job security, and holding a fair competition for a tenured position in the faculty. The Ontario Human Rights Commission backed Chun's complaint, stating that racism was a factor in stopping him from obtaining a full-time position, describing the Physics Department as a \\"poisoned work environment\\", \\"cronyism\\", \\"the dynamic of an 'old boys' network\\" operating in all four job competitions, and \\"a series of reprisals culminating in his dismissal\\". The University however refused to acknowledge the AF&T; report and its recommendations, and tried to have the OHRC dismiss the case. The case dragged on for years. Back in 1994, the University's own appointed investigator for the case, Dr. Cecil Yip, stated that Dr. Chun \\"acted and has been treated like a professoriate in spite of the fact he has derived his salary support entirely from his own external research contracts. And he has served the Department and the University well in this capacity.\\" Further, \\"it is certainly justified for Dr. Chun to feel ... he is being penalized for good performance\\", and concluded, \\"In my judgment Dr. Chun has been exploited by the Department.\\" Overall, the Yip Report concluded that Chun had been exploited, though it found no evidence that he had been a victim of racism. In 1998, Chun launched a $1-million lawsuit against the University for unjust dismissal. Settlement and Aftermath By the time the controversy had ended, President Robert Prichard had departed and he had been succeeded by Robert Birgeneau. A mediated settlement was reached in 2000 and Chun dropped his appeal against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, as well as his $1-million lawsuit against the University. In return, Chun received a full-time faculty position of Research Scientist and Adjunct Professor, $100,000 in compensation, an estimated $150,000 in legal fees and a $260,000 research start-up fund. A column by Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail which attacked the settlement received severe criticism from many students and faculty.http://www.safs.ca/issuescases/uta.htmlhttp://www.safs.ca/issuescases/wente.html The Arts & Science Students' Union (ASSU), which represents more than 22,000 full-time undergraduate students at the University of Toronto described the incident as the \\"Dr. Chun miscarriage of justice\\" when bringing up the controversies of Prichard's administration, on the back of their 2001 Arts and Sciences Anti-Calendar. In 2003, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) established a committee to study Dr. Chun's case. They concluded there were \\"serious irregularities\\" in the hiring process in each case and that Dr. Chun was treated unfairly. They discovered when he had made allegations of systemic discrimination, he was subject to various forms of harassment and unfair treatment, such as being prevented from attending departmental meetings, denied a faculty library card, frustrated from pursuing his research, and prohibited from teaching courses. The inquiry described this as a serious violation of academic freedom.

Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (Œ±) and C3 (Œ≤) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function. The following reaction is the oxidation of the fatty acid by FAD to afford an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated fatty acid thioester of Coenzyme A: center ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence. ACADs are an important class of enzymes in mammalian cells because of their role in metabolizing fatty acids present in ingested food materials. This enzyme's action represents the first step in fatty acid metabolism (the process of breaking long chains of fatty acids into acetyl CoA molecules). Deficiencies in these enzymes are linked to genetic disorders involving fatty acid oxidation (i.e. metabolic disorders). ACAD enzymes have been identified in animals (of which there are 9 major eukaryotic classes), as well as plants, nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. Five of these nine classes are involved in fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation (SCAD, MCAD, LCAD, VLCAD, and VLCAD2), and the other four are involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism (i3VD, i2VD, GD, and iBD). Most acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are Œ±4 homotetramers, and in two cases (for very long chain fatty acid substrates) they are Œ±2 homodimers. An additional class of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was discovered that catalyzes Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturation reactions with steroid-CoA thioesters in certain types of bacteria. This class of ACAD was demonstrated to form Œ±2Œ≤2 heterotetramers, rather than the usual Œ±4 homotetramer, a protein architecture that evolved in order to accommodate a much larger steroid-CoA substrate. ACADs are classified as .  Structure  Structure of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase tetramer. FAD molecules are shown in yellow. PDB code: 1egc. The medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is the best known structure of all ACADs, and is the most commonly deficient enzyme within the class that leads to metabolic disorders in animals. This protein is a homotetramer with each subunit containing roughly 400 amino acids and one equivalent of FAD per monomer. The tetramer is classified as a ‚Äúdimer of dimers‚Äù with an overall diameter of approximately 90 √Ö. The interface between the two monomers of a single dimer of an ACAD contains the FAD binding sites and has extensive bonding interactions. In contrast, the interface between the two dimers has fewer interactions. There are a total of 4 active sites within the tetramer, each of which contains a single FAD molecule and an acyl-CoA substrate binding site. This gives a total of four FAD molecules and four acyl-CoA substrate binding sites per enzyme. FAD is bound between the three domains of the monomer, where only the nucleotide portion is accessible. FAD binding contributes significantly to overall enzyme stability. The acyl-CoA substrate is bound completely within each monomer of the enzyme. The active site is lined with the residues F252, T255, V259, T96, T99, A100, L103, Y375, Y375, and E376. The area of interest within the substrate becomes wedged between Glu 376 and FAD, lining up the molecules into an ideal position for the reaction. MCAD can bind to a rather broad range of chain-lengths in the acyl-CoA substrate, however studies show that its specificity tends to target octanoyl-CoA (C8-CoA). A novel ACAD enzyme architecture in some species of steroid-utilizing bacteria (Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) was discovered, and is involved in the utilization of ubiquitous steroid substrates like cholesterol by pathogenic organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Genetically, the structure is encoded by two separate genes (open reading frames) that form an obligate Œ±2Œ≤2 heterotetramic complex. The structure was most likely the result of an evolutionary event that caused gene duplication and partial loss of function, since half of the FAD cofactor binding residues are in each gene, and only make a complete binding site when expressed together as a complex. This probably allowed for the substrate binding site to open up considerably to accommodate much larger polycyclic-CoA substrates, rather than fatty acids of varying chain lengths.  Mechanism  The overall mechanism of Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mechanism proceeds through an E2 elimination. This elimination is initiated by a glutamate residue, which, while necessary for the mechanism, is not conserved. The residue appears in a wide range of locations within the different types of the enzyme (it is Glu 376 in MCAD). The glutamate residue deprotonates the pro-R hydrogen of the alpha carbon. Hydrogen bonding of the substrate‚Äôs carbonyl oxygen to both the 2‚Äô-OH of the ribityl side-chain of FAD and to the main chain N-H of the previously mentioned glutamate residue lowers the pKa of this proton, allowing it to be readily removed by glutamate. Close-up of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase active site. FAD is bound. The substrate will bind in the space between Glu-376 and FAD when fatty acid oxidation is initialized. PDB code: 3mdd. As the alpha carbon is being deprotonated, the pro-R hydrogen of the beta carbon leaves as a hydride to FAD in a concerted step. It adds to the Re face of FAD at the N-5 position, and the enzyme holds FAD in place through hydrogen bonding with the pyrimidine portion and hydrophobic interactions with the dimethylbenzene portion. The substrate has now been transformed into an Œ±,Œ≤ unsaturated thioester. As FAD picks up the hydride, the carbonyl oxygen adjacent to the N-1 nitrogen becomes negatively charged. These electrons are in resonance with the N-1 nitrogen, distributing and stabilizing the resulting negative charge. The charge is also stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the oxygen and nitrogen of interest and various residues within the enzyme.  Clinical significance  Deficiencies in acyl-CoA dehydrogenases result in decreased ability to oxidize fatty acids, thereby signifying metabolic dysfunction. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies (MCADD) are well known and characterized because they occur most commonly among acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, leading to fatty acid oxidation disorders and the potential of life-threatening metabolic diseases. Some symptoms of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency include intolerance to fasting, hypoglycemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. These symptoms are seen as directly connected to the inability to metabolize fats. Intolerance to fasting and hypoglycemia result from the inability to gain energy and make sugar from fat stores, which is how most of humans' excess energy is stored. Also, fatty acids can begin to accumulate in the blood, lowering the blood's pH and causing acidosis. MCAD is related to / has an association with Sudden Infant Death. Approximately 90% of cases of MCAD are due to a single point mutation where the Lysine at position 304 (Lys304)is replaced by a Glutamate residue and this prevents the enzyme from properly functioning. It is reported that, every year, 1 in 20,000 infants is born with a deficiency in his/her medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases that is caused by a mutation. The mutation is recessive, and often parents of children who suffer from the deficiency can be diagnosed afterward as carriers. In humans the most common naturally occurring mutation in MCAD is located at amino acid residue Lys-304. The altered residue occurs as a result of a single-point mutation in which the lysine side chain is replaced by a glutamate. Lys-304 typically interacts with surrounding amino acid residues by forming hydrogen bonds with Gln-342, Asp-300, and Asp-346. When a mutation causes glutamate to take the place of lysine, an additional negative charge is introduced at that site, which disrupts the normally occurring H-bonding. Such a disruption alters the folding pattern of the enzyme, ultimately compromising its stability and inhibiting its function in fatty acid oxidation. The efficiency of the mutated protein is about 10 times lower than that of the natural protein. This can lead to the symptoms of the deficiency listed above.

Although it is referred to as a salmon in Australia and its species epithet trutta is the Latin for trout, it is not related to salmons or trouts of the family Salmonidae. Other common names for this species include Eastern Australian salmon, bay trout, black back, blackback salmon, buck, buck salmon, cocky salmon, colonial salmon, newfish, and salmon trout. Description Arripis trutta is a streamlined fish with a long and slender body. There is a bony ridge edge of bone beneath and in front of each eye which has obvious serrations in smaller individuals. In larger fish the scales feel smooth. The lobes of the caudal fin are equivalent in length to the head. These fish are dark bluish-green dorsally and silvery white ventrally. The juveniles have golden bars on their upper flanks and these break up into large spots as the fish matures. The pectoral fin is vivid yellow and the caudal and spiny part of the dorsal fin both have a blackish margin. There are 9 spines and 15-17 soft rays in the dorsal fin and 3 spinesand 9-10 soft rays in the anal fin. The maximum total length recorded is although they are commonly a total length of around and the maximum recorded weight is . The most consistent difference between this species and Arripis truttacea is the gill raker count, A. truttacea has 25-31 gill rakers and A trutta has 33-40. Distribution Arripis trutta is found in the south western Pacific Ocean around Australia and New Zealand. In Australia they are found from Moreton Bay in Queensland to western Victoria and northern Tasmania, with infrequent records at Kangaroo Island in South Australia. They are also found around Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island in the Tasman Sea. In New Zealand, they are distributed around the coast but are more common north of Kaikoura on the South Island. They are also found around the Chatham Islands and Kermadec Islands. Habitat and biology Arripis trutta are migratory fish which may migrate long distances, sometimes thousand of kilometres. The adults congregate in very large schools off oceanic beaches and exposed coasts form vast schools along oceanic beaches and exposed areas coastal areas. They will enter rivers. The juveniles live in smaller schools in more sheltered areas such as bays and estuaries, and these mostly occur in the more southerly areas in which this species occurs. It is a carnivorous species which feeds mainly on small pelagic fish and pelagic crustaceans such as krill. They are highly visual predators, preying on a diverse variety which eat a variety of crustaceans and polychaetes during their juvenile phase, however, adults shift their preferred prey to small schooling fish, baitfish such as pilchards, sprats and anchovies. There is some evidence that the diet of A. trutta has undergone a marked shift since the late 20th Century, studies conducted during 1950s and 1960s found that the adults fed largely on krill and squid, which are animals associated with cooler waters. Studies during the early 21st Century have shown that the main prey taken is small pelagic baitfish. It is thought that this shift is a result of long-term changes in the East Australian Current which brings warmer waters from the Coral Sea and has extended farther south since the 1990s. It is further thought that his ‚Äúmulti-decadal southward penetration of the EAC‚Äù is one of the more obvious indications of global warming and the recorded change in the diet of A trutta forms a biological record of global warming. Arripis trutta are preyed on by larger apex predators such as seals, dolphins and sharks. The feeding salmon schools push the schools of the fish they prey on towards the surface making them accessible to seabirds, In this way, this species has an important ecological role in facilitating transfer of energy among the upper levels of the pelagic food chain in inshore ecosystems. An example is the white-fronted tern (Sterna striata) which has the colloquial name \\"kahawai bird\\" because often feeds on shoaling fish in association with kahawai, gulls and shearwaters. Fishermen hunting for schools of kahawai to troll look out for the flocks of white-fronted terns feeding in association with the predatory fish. The Australian population of this species spawns in the surf zone between Lakes Entrance in Victoria and Bermagui in New South Wales in the late spring and summer. The first spawn when they are around four years old and have attained a length of / They can live for up to 26 years. Fisheries Arripis trutta are caught in coastal waters, frequently in the vicinity of estuaries and off coastal beaches. Most of the commercial landings are caught using purse seines and spotter planes may be used to find the large schools They may also be taken as bycatch of purse seine and trawl fisheries pursuing other schooling species like snapper, mackerel and trevally. Although they are fished for throughout southern Australia, the main landings are in southern New South Wales and Eastern Victoria. The flesh of this species is not very popular with consumers and a high proportion of the landings have been used as pet-food or bait. In New Zealand the principal commercial fishing areas are north of Kaikoura in the South Island, off the coast of North Island and in the Cook Strait. Fisheries New Zealand manages that nation's fishery to maintain the population of A trutta at roughly 52% of the stock which was present before modern commercial fisheries began and in 2019 the population was well above that target. =Recreational fisheries= Arripis trutta are highly prized by recreational fishermen, especially for anglers fishing from beaches and rocks. Anglers tend to catch this species using light tackle or by fly fishing and it is said to be a \\"sporting catch\\". Species description Arripis trutta was first formally described in 1801 as Sciaena trutta by Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider with the type locality given as the Cook Strait.

This gene encodes a tetrameric mitochondrial flavoprotein, which is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. This enzyme catalyzes the initial step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta- oxidation pathway. The ACADS gene associated with short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Structure The ACADS gene is approximately 13 kb in length and has 10 exons. The coding sequence of this gene is 1239 bp long. The encoded protein has 412 amino acids, and its size is 44.3 kDa (Human) or 44.9 KDa (Mouse).  Function  The SCAD enzyme catalyzes the first part of fatty acid beta-oxidation by forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in the fatty acid through dehydrogenation of the flavoenzyme. SCAD is specific to short- chain fatty acids, between C2 and C3-acylCoA. The final result of beta- oxidation is acetyl-CoA. When there are defects that result in SCAD being misfolded, there is an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); the increased ROS forces the mitochondria to undergo fission, and the mitochondrial reticulum takes on a grain-like structure. Clinical significance Mutations of the ACADS gene are associated with deficiency of the short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase protein (SCADD); this is also known as butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Many mutations have been identified in specific populations, and large-scale studies have been performed to determine the allelic and genotypic frequency for the defective gene. As short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in beta-oxidation, a deficiency in this enzyme is marked by an increased amount of fatty acids. This deficiency is characterized by the presence of increased butyrylcarnitine (C4) in blood plasma, and increased ethylmalonic acid (EMA) concentrations in urine. Genotypes of individuals with this deficiency have it as a result of a mutation, variant, or a combination of the two. Among one population with the disease, three subgroups have been identified: one group has a failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and hypotonia; another group had seizures; finally, one group had hypotonia and no seizures. Other studies showed that the deficiency may be asymptomatic in some individuals under normal conditions, with symptoms presenting under physiological stress conditions such as fasting or illness. The treatment of this deficiency can sometimes be unclear, because it can sometimes be asymptomatic. The treatment for this disease is similar to treatment of other fatty acid oxidation disorders, by trying to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis, by promoting anabolism and providing alternative sources of energy. Flavin adenine dinucleotide supplementation has also been identified as a therapy for this deficiency, because it is an essential cofactor for proper function of SCAD. SCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Carrier testing can be performed for at-risk family members, and prenatal testing is also a possibility. The ACADS gene has also been implicated in delaying the onset of Prader-Willi Syndrome, which is characterized by hypotonia, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental delays in the first years of life, and hyperphagia and obesity much later. In Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), SCAD has been associated with a reduced amount of insulin release shown by an oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT.

The school also has two libraries, staff offices, bedrooms for boarding pupils, and 25 music practice rooms. Academic subjects are mainly taught in two 20th century buildings within the school grounds. The school is surrounded by gardens in the heart of Edinburgh's West End and has excellent transport connections due to its proximity to Haymarket railway station and connecting bus and tram links. Model in 2016 of proposed new building for school The Song School within the nearby Cathedral precinct is still used by the Choristers for daily practice, where they are surrounded by beautiful murals by Phoebe Anna Traquair. It was these murals (1888‚Äì92), which won Traquair national recognition.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Retrieved 2009-11-04 Within a tunnelled ceiling interior the East Wall depicts the cathedral clergy and choir. The South depicts Traquair's admired contemporaries such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and George Frederic Watts; the North, birds and choristers sing together. The West shows the four beasts singing the Sanctus.Gifford et al. The Public Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh(1984) p366 =Royal High School= In 2016 the school put forward a fully funded ¬£25 million proposal to move its location to the old Royal High School in Edinburgh in competition with another proposal to convert the site to a hotel. The school's plans were accepted by the Edinburgh Council planning committee in 2016 and would have allowed the school to increase the number of its students. However, the council had previously signed a contract with Duddingston House Properties in 2012 to convert the Royal High into a hotel. Two hotel plans were rejected by the Edinburgh Council planning committee in 2015 and 2017.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east- fife-41097272 The St Mary's Music School proposal could not go ahead unless the agreement with Duddingston House Properties were renegotiated or terminated or until after the hotel group's agreement with the Council ended in 2022.

The ships are the first in a series of RDN vessels tasked with carrying out new types of missions, and are to form the backbone of the international operations that the RDN is increasingly focusing on. The Absalon-class ships are primarily designed for command and support roles, with a large ro-ro deck, but with their many offensive weapons and new anti-submarine weapons and tasks, the class was changed to frigates in 2020. While the following three frigates of the will be equipped for a combat role and potentially equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles, a first for the Danish Navy. Although similar to the Absalon-class vessels, these frigates will not have a large ro-ro deck. the frigates received full operational status in 2010 and 2011, replacing the corvettes. Absalon is one of a number of vessels to have been filmed by documentary makers to appear on the Mighty Ships TV programme, detailing the capabilities and stories of the ship and crew.Mighty Ships Service =Somali counter- piracy mission= Starting in 2008, HDMS Absalon participated in the UN-led counter-piracy mission off Somalia and the east coast of Africa, acting as flagship to the Danish Task Group which led Task Force 150. In September 2008, as part of the task force, Absalon was involved in the capture of 10 pirates, who were eventually set free. On 3 December 2008, after the mandate had been extended, Absalon rescued a disabled skiff with suspected pirates aboard in the Gulf of Aden, 90 miles off the coast of Yemen; the Somali craft was reported to hold rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, and to have been adrift for several days. Absalon took the sailors and weapons aboard, sank the craft, and turned the sailors over to the Yemeni Coast Guard. Absalon was reportedly the most successful counter-piracy warship in the Gulf of Aden, capturing 88 out of the 250 pirates detained.Danish Newspaper Article On 16 March 2009, Absalon, along with the Turkish frigate , successfully prevented pirates from capturing the Vietnamese cargo ship . Absalons counter- piracy mission with NATO Task Force 150 in Somali waters ended 1 April 2009, after resulting in the capture of over 80 pirates, some of whom were transferred to the Netherlands for trial. On 5 February 2010, Absalon helped to rescue the crew of the Antigua and Barbuda-flagged merchant vessel , which was being hijacked by six armed pirates. Absalon dispatched a helicopter and a special forces team, deterring the pirates. On 1 March 2010, Absalon was reported to have sunk a Somali pirate mother ship carrying several pirate speedboats in the Indian Ocean. On 7 January 2012, Absalon intercepted and boarded a Somali pirate mother ship in the Indian Ocean. The boarding crew freed 14 Iranian and Pakistani fishermen who had been held as hostages for over two months. =The Mediterranean= On 30 November 2015, Minister of Defence Peter Christensen, announced that Absalon was to be moved to the Mediterranean Sea, in order to accommodate Turkey's request to NATO, for a larger military presence in the area.

ACADL is a gene that encodes LCAD - acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain - which is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family. The acyl- CoA dehydrogenase family is primarily responsible for beta-oxidation of fatty acids within the mitochondria. LCAD dysfunction is associated with lowered fatty acid oxidation capacity and decreased heat generation. As a result, LCAD deficiency has been correlated with increased cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary disease, and overall insulin resistance. Structure Acadl is a single-copy, nuclear encoded gene approximately 35 kb in size. The gene contains 11 coding exons ranging in size from 67 bp to 275 bp, interrupted by 10 introns ranging in size from 1.0 kb to 6.6 kb in size. The Acadl 5' regulatory region, like other members of the Acad family, lacks a TATA or CAAT box and is GC rich. This region does contain multiple, putative cis-acting DNA elements recognized by either SP1 or members of the steroid-thyroid family of nuclear receptors, which has been shown with other members of the ACAD gene family to be important in regulated expression.  Function  The LCAD enzyme catalyzes most of fatty acid beta-oxidation by forming a C2-C3 trans-double bond in the fatty acid. LCAD works on long-chain fatty acids, typically between C12 and C16-acylCoA. LCAD is essential for oxidizing unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, but seems redundant in the oxidation of saturated fatty acids. Fatty acid oxidation has proven to spare glucose in fasting conditions, and is also required for amino acid metabolism, which is essential for the maintenance of adequate glucose production. LCAD is regulated by a reversible acetylation mechanism by SIRT3, in which the active form of the enzyme is deacetylated, and hyperacetylation reduces the enzymatic activity.  Animal studies  In mice, LCAD deficient mice have been shown to expend less energy, and are also subject to hypothermia, which can be explained by the fact that a reduced rate of fatty acid oxidation is correlated with a lowered capacity to generate heat. Indeed, when LCAD mice are exposed to the cold, the expression of fatty acid oxidation genes was elevated in liver. As ACADL is a mitochondrial protein, and a member of the beta-oxidation family, there are many instances in which its deficiency is correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the diseases that manifest as a result. The ACADL gene has been correlated with protecting against diabetes. In corroboration, primary defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity, as illustrated by LCAD knockout mice, can lead to diacylglycerol accumulation, otherwise known as steatosis, as well as PKCepsilon activation, and hepatic insulin resistance. In animals with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, LCAD and MCAD work to compensate for the reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity; this compensation is modest, however, and the fatty acid oxidation levels do not return completely to wild type levels. Additionally, LCAD has been shown to have no mechanism that compensates for its deficiency. In the heart, LCAD knockout mice rely more heavily on glucose oxidation, concurrently while there is a large need for replenishment of metabolic intermediates, or analplerosis. During fasting, the increased glucose usage cannot maintain homeostasis in LCAD knockout mice. LCAD knockout mice displayed a higher level of cardiac hypertrophy, as indicated by increased left ventricular wall thickness and an increased amount of metabolic cardiomyopathy. The knockout mice also had increased triglyceride levels in the myocardium, which is a detrimental disease phenotype. Carnitine supplementation did lower the triglyceride levels in these knockout mice, but did not have any effect on hypertrophy or cardiac performance. The ACADL gene has also been linked to pathophysiology of pulmonary disease. In humans, this protein was shown to be localized to the human alveolar type II pneumocytes, which synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant. Mice that were lacking LCAD (-/-) had dysfunctional or reduced amounts of pulmonary surfactant, which is required to prevent infection; the mice who did not have this protein also displayed a significantly reduced lung capacity in a variety of tests. Clinical significance As LCAD deficiency has not yet been found in humans, it has also been postulated that LCAD confers a critical role in development of the blastocoele in human embryos.

There were ten initial membersThese men were Professor Vendyl Jones (R.I.P), Jack Saunders, Billy Jack Dial (Retired), James D. Long, Bud Gill, Larry Borntrager, Roger Grattan, Jacob Scharff, Andrew Overall and Adam Penrod. who flew to Israel and pledged to uphold the Seven Laws of Noah and to conduct themselves under the authority of the Noahide beit din (religious court) of the Sanhedrin. Conception The idea for the council was first conceived by Rabbi Avraham Toledano. He, as well as many others, understood that B'nei Noah, like Jews, need a body of recognized leaders and scholars to whom they can turn for guidance in their study and observance of Torah, and who can help to unify the communities around the world. To this end, suitable candidates were sought out who would be willing and able to establish such a body. These nominees were brought together in mid-2005 by the personal invitation of, and under the supervision of an authorized representative of a controversial attempt to revive the Sanhedrin, forming a proto-Noahide Council. The founding proto-Council members then appeared before the same body in Jerusalem, on January 9, 2006 (9 Tevet, 5766). Authority The council is not a beit din (court of judges), and does not have any legal (halakhic) power to make rulings. Rather, it states that it is an autonomous body of Noahide leaders and scholars with its halakhic (religious) supervision and guidance, to promote the education, unification, and edification of Noahides and Noahide Communities around the world. Appointment of members The current members of the council were personally invited to take part in this endeavor. However, the members of the council were not \\"ordained\\". Rather, having been invited to participate, they agreed to work together to establish this council. Activities The council was behind the establishment of the wikinoah.org website designed to cover every aspect of all Noachite religions.

The fictional series recounts the story of Auraya, a young priestess who, after rising to the highest rank in her world's religious hierarchy, subsequently discovers that the gods she worships are significantly different entities from those in whom she was originally taught to believe. Plot synopsis Age of the Five is set in a universe overseen by a pantheon of five gods (the Circle) who are the only apparent survivors of the War of the Gods. Before this war, it is understood that hundreds of gods existed on Earth. The Five control the destiny of the northern half of the world through a priesthood known as the White (the Circle's five representatives in the human world, Ithania). In southern Ithania live opponents of the White, who claim to worship five different gods (known as the Five). Both factions vie for control over their opponents, and eventually engage in war. Auraya (protagonist) is chosen to be a White. Beginning with diplomatic missions, she later moves on to fighting in a major battle between the north and the south. She discovers she has innate powers far exceeding those of her peers; it later turns out that she is a potential new Wild (a group of immortal sorcerers who have been persecuted by the will of the gods). Later in the series the Wilds are discovered to be at the final stage before godhood, and they discover a way to kill the existing pantheon of gods. Throughout the series Auraya's attitude towards her gods changes from obedience to distrust to hatred, as she realizes their moral defects. In the end, the pantheon are trapped by the Wilds, whereupon one of the Gods commits suicide killing all the other gods too. The epilogue reveals that humanity spends the next fifty years warring in the power vacuum left by the gods until a new religion (with a single, all- powerful god, the Maker) is adopted by the Sennon emperor to keep the peace.  The Five/Circle  After the War of the Gods (in which many deities were killed), only six gods were left alive. Following the suicide of the sixth (Sorli) the remainder established themselves as gods of Ithania, creating two rival traditions to worship them: the Pentadrians and the Circlians. Assuming different names and images for each religion, the Five spent their time playing games with humanity, pitting the religions against each other and convincing each faith that the other was heretical. The Five were known as the Circle in the Circlian religion, and as the Five to the Pentadrians; they were represented by the White in the Circlians, and the Voices of the Gods to the Pentadrians. The Five were killed when six Wilds surrounded them, creating a void. When the Wilds drew the magic away, one area of magic was left in the center of the newly created void. Although the gods could have survived until the magic flowed back (freeing them), Chaia (trying to protect the humans from the other gods' influence) drew all the magic into himself, killing himself and the other four gods. To the Circlians, the Five were: *Chaia: God of Kings *Huan: Goddess of Fertility *Lore: God of War *Yranna: Goddess of Women *Saru: God of Wealth To the Pentadrians, the Five were: *Sheyr: God of Prosperity *Hrun: Goddess of Love *Alor: God of Warriors *Ranah: Goddess of Moon and Fire *Sraal: God of Gambling = Chaia/Sheyr = Known as Chaia (God of Kings) to the Circlians and Sheyr (God of Prosperity) to the Pentadrians, Chaia was a legendary seducer (on a par with Mirar) who was hated by the immortals and Dreamweavers for his sexual habits. Using magic to please his lovers in a way no physical sensation could match, he left young women mad (and shells of their former selves) when he grew bored and cast them aside. As Auraya's lover Chaia protected her and interceded on her behalf, showing her the treachery of Huan and saving her from being raped and killed by Nekaun. There is evidence he was sincerely attached to Auraya. = Huan/Hrun = Known as Huan (Goddess of Fertility) to the Circlians and Hrun (Goddess of Love) to the Pentadrians, Huan was notorious for her capriciousness and cruelty. Deforming and torturing thousands of humans to create mutants such as the Siyee and Elai, Huan was hated by Dreamweavers and immortals alike. She was initially a supporter of Auraya, but after the White's refusal to kill Mirar (or let the goddess possess her), Huan attempted to kill and maim her. Chaia blamed her for pushing Auraya too far. She was a proud, arrogant, scheming goddess, demanding unquestioning obedience from her followers. Decisions were mostly made by Chaia and Huan, the other Gods were mainly persuaded to follow their point of view. They were not as united as they wanted their followers to believe. Reception Critical reception from the fantasy press was positive. Jennifer Fallon said, \\"A wonderfully and meticulously detailed world, and an edge-of- the-seat plot, this book is a must for lovers of good fantasy\\".

Life Born at Trinity Lutheran Hospital on August 10, 1926, Wheeler graduated from Westport High School in 1942. A third generation physician, Wheeler entered Kansas City Junior College in 1942, transferring to University of Louisville in 1944 and earned a B.A. in 1946. From March 1944 through February 1946, Wheeler was simultaneously serving in the US Navy. In 1946, he entered the University of Kansas, earning an M.D. in 1950. His internship was at Charity Hospital in New Orleans in 1950. Wheeler joined the US Air Force in July 1950, serving until July 1953 as a Captain and Flight Surgeon to the original group of the Thunderbirds, the Air Force aerial acrobatic team. Wheeler did his pathology residency at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri from 1953 to 1955. At the same time, he began studying at night for a law degree at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, which he completed in 1959. In 1957, Wheeler became an Associate Pathologist and Director of Laboratories at Kansas City General Hospital, followed by stints at Kansas City Research Hospital, North Kansas City Memorial Hospital, and the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital. He founded Wheeler Medical Laboratories in 1963. Wheeler began his public career when he was elected Coroner of Jackson County, Missouri in January 1965. He served in that office until January 1967, when he was elected as Judge of the Western District of the Jackson County Court until January 1971. Kansas City mayor In 1971 he was elected to two consecutive terms as mayor of Kansas City. Although the office of mayor does not have a formal party affiliation in Kansas City, Wheeler is Democrat. During his tenure he oversaw the financing and construction of both the Kemper Arena and the Bartle Hall Convention Center. The combination of the two enabled the city to host the 1976 Republican National Convention. Towards the end of his second term, Kansas City gained international attention hosting a work by the artist Christo, the 2.5 mile long Wrapped Walk Ways in Loose Park. Wheeler presented Christo and his partner Jeanne-Claude with the key to the city. Kansas City International Airport opened in 1972 during his watch. It replaced the Kansas City Downtown Airport, which is now formally named for him. So much successful development happened during Wheeler's two terms as mayor that a 2002 profile in the conservative Kansas city business magazine Ingram's said: \\"Many regard this as the last golden age of Kansas City with the construction of KCI, Worlds of Fun, Crown Center, and the Truman Sports Complex.\\" Wheeler ran for the U.S. Senate in 1976 and garnered less than 2% of the votehttp://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=230003 in the Democratic primary in a race that was won by Jerry Litton, who died in a plane crash en route to the victory party in Kansas City. John C. Danforth ultimately won the position. Wheeler ran for mayor of Kansas City one additional time in 2011, but his candidacy did not survive the primary. State Senator Wheeler defeated Rep. Henry Rizzo in the August 6, 2002 Democratic primary, and his other opponent Rep. Tom Hoppe did not collect enough signatures to run as an Independent. No Republican ran in the election, and he was elected to the State Senate from the 10th District. He opposed a bill to outlaw the morning after pill, explaining that \\"From Monday through Saturday, we have to work in a secular world\\", and was a co-sponsor of Missouri Senate Bill 458, the \\"Patient Protection Act\\" that would compel a pharmacist to fill any prescription. He did not concurrently seek re-election to the senate and was succeeded by Democrat Jolie Justus in the 10th district seat. Post state senate elections In 2006, at the age of 79, Wheeler ran for Jackson County Executive, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by county prosecutor Mike Sanders. In 2008, Wheeler ran for the Democratic nomination for Missouri State Treasurer. He placed fourth behind the nominee Clint Zweifel, Andria Simckes and Mark Powell. On March 28, 2016, at the age of 89 Wheeler filed to run for Governor of Missouri. He placed third in the primary with 7.9 percent in an election won by Chris Koster who had 78.08 percent of the vote. Doctor in Politics Wheeler was the only physician in the Missouri State Senate. Having authored \\"Doctor in Politics\\" in 1974, Wheeler is a frequent lecturer and speaker. He has served as Assistant Clinical Professor of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical School, as well as adjunct professor and consultant to the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine and the Henry W. Bloch School of Business and Public Administration. Wheeler is an American Diplomat of the Board of Pathology, certified in Pathologic Anatomy and Clinical Pathology, and, Forensic Pathology. He is recipient of the American Medical Association's Benjamin Rush Award (1971), the University of Missouri-Kansas City Lifetime Achievement Award (1984), and the Kansas University Medical Distinguished Alumnus Award (1997).

It starts as lowland field drainage west of Congleton, flows along the south edge of Holmes Chapel, and joins the River Dane at Middlewich. It is about long. According to an historical account, dating back to 1585, the course of the River Croco begins west of Bag Mere: :That which they call the Croco is a small Brook, which cometh out of Bagmer-mere, and passeth by Brereton church and hall (the ancient house of the surname of Breretons) through Brereton park, Kinderton park, through Middlewich, and not far from thence, falleth into the Dane at Croxton, near the same place, where the Wheelock falleth in also. The Place-Names of England and Wales (1915) suggests that the name Croco may be Celtic or even earlier. Historical maps show the source of the river to be the lowland field drainage system to the northeast of Brookhouse Green. From here, the river heads north past the hamlet of Illidge Green and then northwest via Brereton Hall, where a weir and boathouse were created to the west of Saint Oswald's Church. The river flows northwest towards Parkmill Farm, where again a weir was constructed to form Brereton Pool. It then heads towards Holmes Chapel before turning west and passing under London Road (A50) at Alum Bridge. The river continues this westward course, passing under the M6 and Poolford Lane near Cinderhill and then Brereton Lane, north of Dockbank Farm at Sproston. The river continues its westward journey via Fender Wood, winding its way north of Kinderton Lodge towards Middlewich, where it is joined by Sanderson's Brook southeast of the town, near Brooks Lane. It then heads northwest on the right-hand side of the Trent and Mersey Canal until it joins the River Dane at the northwest corner of Harbutt's Field. The river passes through the Midpoint 18 business park in Middlewich Back in Fender Wood, the river forks at a weir, where a man made upper stream of water follows the field boundaries, past what was Brookhouse Farm (now replaced by the Salt Cellar public house and restaurant), then under Pochin Way (historically the start of Lodge Lane), through Midpoint 18 business park and under Holmes Chapel Road, before running through the garden of the bungalow to the east of the Old Station House. Here, it disappears through a culvert towards the railway embankment. Historically, this brook would have fed the mill pond that powered the Kinderton Corn Mill, as shown in the 1882 Ordnance Survey map. Looking at a topographic map, the elevation of the River Croco is about 85 m (280 ft) at source, falling to 27 m (89 ft) at the point where it flows into the River Dane.

The annual college football game is frequently referred to as the Holy War. In the 1890s, when BYU was still known as Brigham Young Academy (BYA), the two schools started competing athletically. The schools have met continually since 1909 in men's basketball, and met once a year in football from 1922‚Äì2013, with the exception of 1943‚Äì45 when BYU did not field a team due to World War II. Both schools formerly competed in the Mountain West Conference, but both teams left the MWC in 2011‚ÄîUtah joined the Pac-12 Conference and BYU became a football independent while joining the West Coast Conference for other sports. There are several conditions which foster the rivalry: proximity of the two schools, successes of the academics and athletic teams, and religion. BYU is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), while Utah is a secular institution and the flagship university of the state's System of Higher Education. Unique characteristics =Religion= This rivalry has traditionally featured Mormons vs. Mormons between Utah's two oldest universities. Subsequently, the football game played between these two schools has come to be known as the Holy War. Both schools were founded by the LDS Church, have significant percentages of LDS students and faculty as well as many historical and customary affiliations with Mormonism, such as LDS institutes and dry campuses. As much as religion is a common historical foundation for the rivalry, it has also been a source of animosity, and many have sought to downplay the aspect of rivalry within the religion. The University of Utah (aka \\"the U\\") is a public state-owned school. Because this rivalry includes a state vs. church dimension, many fans of both schools use it as a forum to vent deeply held feelings and perceptions. While the LDS Church owns BYU, some of the church's top leadership, including current church president Russell M. Nelson and his predecessor, Thomas S. Monson, attended and graduated from the University of Utah. Brigham Young, the church's second president, and the man for whom BYU is named, founded the University of Deseret, which later became the University of Utah when it was bought out by other state residents. Former church president David O. McKay played right guard for Utah's first football team in 1894 and former apostle, Joseph B. Wirthlin, also played football for the University of Utah. =Successful programs= Both Utah and BYU have ebbed and flowed with successful athletic programs over the years. The two teams were part of the same conference from 1922 to 2010, and their clashes often decided the conference title. The BYU‚ÄìUtah rivalry remains heated and intense whether the schools are dueling in football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, women's gymnastics and volleyball, or even rugby (where schools compete annually for the Wasatch Cup). =Location= The institutions are a 45-minute drive down Interstate 15 from each other. The close proximity has caused the schools to constantly compete against each other for recruits, as well as for fan support. =Longevity= Utah and BYU also have a long history in football, however the two schools disagree on exactly when the series started. BYU asserts that the series began in 1922, but Utah claims that it actually began in 1896 when BYU was known as BYA. From 1896 to 1899, BYA and Utah played each other six times, with each school winning three games. Both schools agree that Utah leads the football series; Utah claims a 61‚Äì34‚Äì4 lead, while BYU says Utah leads 58‚Äì31‚Äì4. As noted, the two schools were part of the same conference for almost 90 years. History In 1895, BYA and the University of Utah met for the first sporting event between the two schools: a baseball game. The scoreless match ended with a bench-clearing brawl, and a rivalry was born. =The early years= Unsurprisingly, the history of the BYU‚ÄìUtah rivalry is also in dispute. Utah claims that the football rivalry began in the late 19th century, when Utah played BYA six times between 1896 and 1899. BYU does not count these games in their official records, since it was not then known as BYU, but BYA. Furthermore, BYU asserts that the first of those football games, a 12‚Äì4 Utah victory in April 1896, was in actuality a practice-scrimmage to prepare for the following fall season. But whether or not the game meant anything to the schools at the time, it certainly meant a great deal to the fans. At the end of the match, a fight broke out between fans of the two schools. Through most of its history, this rivalry was classified as mainly a basketball rivalry. Though the schools have regularly played each other in football since at least 1922, the football aspect (known as the ‚ÄúHoly War‚Äù) was very one-sided. Utah dominated from the start and even with the resurgence of BYU football in the 1970s, Utah still has a large overall lead in the series. Not counting the disputed games involving BYA, Utah won the first six meetings by a combined score of 186‚Äì13. And by 1941, Utah led the series-record 17‚Äì0, with 3 ties. BYU finally earned its first victory of the rivalry in 1942, but wouldn't win another until 1958. By 1964, Utah had extended its record against BYU to 34‚Äì2, with 4 ties. On the other hand, the basketball aspect of the rivalry was very competitive from its beginning in 1909. BYU won the first eight meetings, and by an average margin of about 12 points (including a 32‚Äì9 victory in the first game). After that though, neither team would win more than 4 straight until 1938; an impressive statistic considering that the teams would often play 4‚Äì5 times per season back then. The series remained close, and from 1939 to 1971, Utah won 37 of the meetings and BYU won 36. During the early years of the rivalry, only Utah enjoyed basketball success on the national level. Utah won a National Championship in 1944, reached the Final Four in 1961 and 1966, and won the NIT Tournament in 1947. BYU won the NIT twice: in 1951, and again in 1966, when the NIT was still considered at least equal to, if not better than, the NCAA basketball tournament. =The rise of BYU football= During the 1970s and 80s, the basketball side of the rivalry remained close, with Utah winning 21 games and BYU winning 19. Meanwhile, the football side also began to intensify. In 1972, BYU hired a new head football coach, LaVell Edwards. In Edwards‚Äô first season at the helm, BYU defeated Utah for the first time in five years. In 1974, BYU was invited to their first ever bowl game, after winning the conference championship for the second time ever. BYU also began to annually dominate Utah, who was experiencing a series of losing seasons and coaching changes. By 1976, Edwards had compiled a 5‚Äì0 record against the Utes. In 1977, Utah hired a new coach of their own, Wayne Howard. That year, BYU soundly beat Utah 38‚Äì8 in Provo. With less than two minutes left, BYU's star QB, Marc Wilson, was sent back into the game to set an NCAA passing record and rack up an astounding 571 passing yards. In his post-game remarks to the press, Howard accused Edwards of running up the score, and was quoted as saying: > \\"This today will be inspiring. The hatred between BYU and Utah is nothing > compared to what it will be. It will be a crusade to beat BYU from now on. > This is a prediction: In the next two years Utah will drill BYU someday, but > we won‚Äôt run up the score even if we could set an NCAA record against them.\\" Howard was able to lead Utah to victory over the Cougars the next year, but it would be his only time, and Utah's only victory over BYU in a 16-year period. Howard continued to have an intensity toward the rivalry, but retired from coaching after the 1981 season. BYU went on to make a major impact on the national level. From 1979‚Äì92, BYU went 13‚Äì1 against the Utes, won 11 conference championships, and a national championship in 1984. Utah's lone football victory over the Cougars during this period came in 1988. As the football rivalry intensified, the emotion carried over into other sports. For instance, during a baseball game in the mid-1980s, BYU players taunted the Ute pitcher. The pitcher reacted by throwing a fastball into the Cougar dugout, igniting a bench-clearing brawl. As the 1990s began, BYU's football program's success began to lessen, although from 1989‚Äì96, BYU won at least a share of the WAC championship every year but one (1994, in which Utah ended the season in the top 10). In 1996, Edwards assembled one of his best teams: winning 14 games, finishing the season #5 in both major polls, and with a thrilling victory over Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl Classic. That season, the Cougars snapped their 3-game losing streak to Utah, who had started to field a competitive team under the leadership of Coach Ron McBride. Under McBride, (hired in 1990), Utah found more success in football. In 1994, they compiled a 10‚Äì2 record, beat BYU, beat Arizona in the Freedom Bowl, and finished the season ranked #8 in the Coaches Poll. =The resurgence of Utah basketball= In the meantime, the basketball rivalry remained just as competitive as ever. In 1989, BYU and Utah each hired new head basketball coaches, Roger Reid and Rick Majerus respectively. These two coaches brought their colorful, and often controversial, personalities to an already-lively rivalry. These coaches also had considerable success during their tenures. During Reid's seven-year term as coach, BYU won two WAC titles, played in five NCAA Tournaments, and one NIT. In the fifteen head-to-head meetings involving these two coaches, Reid's teams won eight games, and Majerus‚Äô teams won seven. However, Majerus would go on to have a much better career overall. In Majerus‚Äô 12 full seasons as Utah coach, the Utes made 11 post-season appearances, including four Sweet Sixteens, and a Final Four in 1998. That year, the Utes lost to Kentucky in the championship game after holding a double-digit halftime lead. Utah's resurgence to national basketball prominence, and BYU's struggles in the late 1990s, are illustrated by the fact that from 1995‚Äì2000, the Utes beat the Cougars 12 straight times. Additionally, BYU never won a game at Utah between 1994 and 2006. This resurgence was short-lived, however. Since 2006, BYU owns a 10‚Äì4 record against Utah in men's basketball. =The present= Baseball game between BYU and Utah, played March 20, 2007 at Smith's Ballpark in Salt Lake City. Utah won this game 8‚Äì4. In the 2000s, BYU and Utah have each found themselves in the spotlight again. Especially in football, where several meetings have had important MWC, if not national, implications. In 2001, BYU came within a single game of making the case to become the first BCS non-AQ conference team to deserve a BCS bowl bid. Their near-perfect season included a thrilling 24‚Äì21 come-from-behind victory over the Utes on national television. Three years later, BYU and Utah met with a BCS invite again on the line, but this time it was Utah who was looking to cap off a perfect season. Under second-year head coach Urban Meyer, and future #1 NFL Draft choice Alex Smith at QB, the Utes beat the Cougars 52‚Äì21, and clinched a bid to the Fiesta Bowl. ESPN sent their College GameDay crew out to Salt Lake to highlight the event. In November 2005, The Wall Street Journal ranked the BYU-Utah football rivalry as the fourth-best in the country. Since 2011, when Utah joined the PAC-12 and BYU football became an independent, the football rivalry has become one-sided, with Utah winning every game played between the sides. On the basketball front, both schools regularly compete for the conference championship and post-season berths. Furthermore, the rivalry has featured such players as NBA lottery pick Rafael Ara√∫jo and the 10th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Jimmer Fredette for BYU, and NBA #1 Pick Andrew Bogut for Utah. To commemorate the rivalry, Utah's former coach, Ray Giacoletti was known to wear a red sports jacket (the \\"Giac-et\\") during each meeting. And while the on- court intensity remains with the rivalry, off-court controversy is seemingly ever-present as well. In April 2004, eight Utah baseball players hiked onto the hillside above BYU's campus where lies a large concrete \\"Y.\\" The players then painted the landmark red, and proceeded to take pictures of themselves in front of their handiwork. Ten days later, an employee of a discount store in Salt Lake notified the police that a customer had recently developed pictures of himself and friends in front of the painted \\"Y.\\" The customer happened to be Ute pitcher Ryan Breska, and the store employee happened to be a BYU fan. When Breska returned to pick up his photos, police were waiting to arrest him. Breska and the rest of \\"The Utah 8\\" (as they became known) were charged with second-degree felony mischief, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. After much media publicity and public debate, authorities in Provo agreed to reduce the charges to class B misdemeanors and a fine of $6,267.20. The matches have proved to be so intensive and compelling that in 2008 Deseret First Credit Union decided to sponsor the matches between the two schools, with the winning school being award a trophy at the end of each year. The event awards points for each head-to-head winner of the two schools across 12 sports: football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's swimming, women's gymnastics, men's and women's tennis, baseball, softball, women's soccer, and women's volleyball. These 12 sports encompass the Deseret First Duel. The schools face off in regular season matches. The winner of each match is awarded 3 points as part of the Deseret First Duel scoring system, with the exception of football and men's basketball, where the winner gets 10 points. (The point system was altered prior to 2017, giving basketball winners just 3 points and football winners just 5 points.) Since the conception of the duel in 2008, Utah now leads the series, with seven titles to five for BYU. BYU won in 2008, and Utah won in 2009. Then the schools each won three years in a row, with BYU winning the title in 2010‚Äì2012, and Utah winning in 2013‚Äì2015. In 2016 and 2017, the two schools traded victories once again. Utah won again in 2018 and 2019, and has now won 6 of the last 7 Deseret Duel titles.  2016 Basketball Cancellation Controversy  In January 2016, Utah Coach Larry Krystkowiak ignited a controversy in the state of Utah for deciding to cancel a scheduled game between the two teams in the 2016‚Äì17 season. Krystkowiak said the main reason for the game's cancellation was increasingly chippy play among players of both teams in what had become an increasingly heated rivalry in recent years. This concern escalated following a punch thrown by BYU guard Nick Emery at Utah guard Brandon Taylor during the Dec. 2, 2015 contest. In the second half, after some back-and-forth physicality between the guards, Emery cocked his arm back and hit Taylor in the face‚Äîwho then fell to the court and smacked his head on the hardwood. Krystkowiak said after the game that he was incensed by Emery's punch and what appeared to be further taunting by the freshman guard as well as a lack of discipline by BYU coach Dave Rose concerning the play. Krystkowiak initially noted that he felt subsequent apologies from Emery and BYU coach Dave Rose lacked sincerity but after sincere text messages between Krystkowiak and Emery, Krystkowiak accepted his apology considered the situation resolved. The West Coast Conference, the league in which BYU plays, ultimately suspended Emery for one game but BYU took no additional disciplinary action‚Äîfurther souring Krystkowiak's view of the ordeal.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/01/11/utah-coach- says-toxic-atmosphere-halted-byu-series/78645310/ The game's cancellation, the first interruption in the series since World War II, drew mixed views from local and national media. Most Utah fans and some among national sports media, including ESPN hosts Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon, applauded Krystkowiak's decision to cancel the game ‚Äîciting incidents that have given BYU athletics a reputation for \\"dirty play\\" in recent years. Krystkowiak called his decision largely as ‚Äúprotecting myself from myself‚Äù. A few of the local media, most of the BYU fanbase, and even Utah Governor Herbert criticized the move, citing the deep historical significance of the series. Cougar fans called the move petty, noting that a Utah player had allegedly slapped a BYU player five years previous. Utah and BYU used to play two games every season while members of the same conference. Though currently members of different leagues the teams are not required to play and games that are scheduled have no bearing on either team's conference record. Utah's football program took a two-year break in the series to play Michigan in a home and home series (with Utah winning both games); the break ended early when the two schools ended up playing against each other in the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl. They resumed regular football contests in 2016, with a game scheduled every year through 2024. Utah has now won nine straight games against BYU in the series. Highlights =Basketball= *March 5, 1983‚Äì Provo Utah (14‚Äì13, 9‚Äì5) beats BYU (14‚Äì13, 10‚Äì4) in an epic triple-overtime game.

In the final seconds of the third overtime, Utah freshman Bobby Adair hits the game winning shot. :Utah 86, BYU 85 (3OT) *February 27, 1988‚Äì Salt Lake City Earlier in the season, a highly favored BYU team beat Utah 82‚Äì64 in Provo, extending their record to 17‚Äì0, and earning a #3 national ranking. BYU would eventually climb as high as #2, but three weeks later, the Utes (16‚Äì9, 8‚Äì5) upset the #2 Cougars (23‚Äì2, 12‚Äì1) in Salt Lake City. Utah's Keith Chapman scored two 3-point shots in the final 90 seconds, including the game-winning shot at the buzzer. :Utah 62, BYU 60 *March 8, 1990‚Äì El Paso, TX After missing the majority of the season due to health problems, Utah coach Rick Majerus watched the game from the stands as the Utes (15‚Äì13, 7‚Äì9) and Cougars (21‚Äì7, 11‚Äì5) met in the first round of the WAC Tournament. The highly favored BYU squad was able to establish a nine-point lead with 11:23 left in the game, but Utah, led by Josh Grant, Craig Rydalch, and Walter Watts, fought back to force overtime. Once again, BYU was able to establish a seemingly-comfortable 5-point lead with 34 seconds left in OT, but Utah would close the game by hitting two 3-pointers, including the game winner by Tommy Connor (who played with a broken finger) with seven seconds left. Andy Toolson led the Cougars with 21 points, but star senior Marty Haws was held to nine. :Utah 62, BYU 61 (OT) *March 9, 1991‚Äì Laramie, WY BYU (19‚Äì12, 11‚Äì5) and Utah (28‚Äì2, 15‚Äì1) met in the 1991 WAC Championship game. The Utes came back from a nine-point second half deficit to force overtime. But with the game tied, Utah's Tyrone Tate committed a foul, which allowed BYU's Nathan Call to put the Cougars up by two from the free-throw line with :08 left. On the ensuing possession, Utah's Josh Grant spotted Tate all alone under the basket. Tate got the pass, but his wide-open lay-up bounced off the rim. He managed to grab the rebound, but his put-back attempt also bounced off as time expired. BYU's 7-foot-6 freshman Shawn Bradley led all scorers with 21 points; he also added 13 rebounds and five blocked shots. :BYU 51, Utah 49 (OT) *Feb. 27, 1993‚Äì Salt Lake City Perhaps the most highly anticipated BYU/Utah game ever. BYU (22‚Äì5, 14‚Äì1) and Utah (21‚Äì3, 14‚Äì1) entered the game tied for first- place in the WAC. Additionally, Utah was ranked #11 in the nation, and BYU was #23. After playing close for nearly 30 minutes, Utah opened up a 12-point lead and never trailed from then on. Utah's Phil Dixon scored a career-high 28 points, and Josh Grant pulled down 22 rebounds. Gary Trost scored 26 for the Cougars. :Utah 89, BYU 83 *Jan. 8, 1994‚Äì Salt Lake City The second-largest crowd ever in the Huntsman Center saw BYU (8‚Äì3, 1‚Äì1) steal one from Utah (7‚Äì4, 1‚Äì1) in Salt Lake. Down by two with 16-seconds left and 3-seconds on the shot- clock, Robbie Reid nailed a 25-foot three-pointer. Ten seconds later, Utah's Craig Rydalch hit the apparent game winning lay-up, but he was called for charging. Reid, a true freshman and the coach's son, went 4‚Äì6 from beyond the arc, including the game winner. Another true freshman, Keith Van Horn, had 21 points for the Utes. The Cougars wouldn't win again at the Huntsman Center until the 2006‚Äì07 season. :BYU 64, Utah 62 *March 10, 1994 ‚Äì Salt Lake City: :\\"The Great Caucasian Shootout\\" Utah (14‚Äì13, 8‚Äì10) became the victim of a BYU (19‚Äì8, 12‚Äì6) ‚Äústatement game‚Äù in the WAC Tournament. BYU Coach Roger Reid allowed his starters to play the majority of the game, despite leading by as many as 33 points. The Cougars shot 73.9% from the field in the first half, and 63.5% for the game. :BYU 98, Utah 67 *March 10, 2000 ‚Äì Las Vegas, NV Having lost the last 12 meetings, BYU (19‚Äì9, 7‚Äì7) finally beat Utah (22‚Äì7, 10‚Äì4), and they did it during the inaugural Mountain West Conference Tournament. The Cougars staged a 12‚Äì3 run to start the second half and go up 38‚Äì33. Utah managed to tie it up at 42, but with 8:39 remaining BYU took the lead for good. BYU forward Eric Nielsen, who scored a career-high 17 points, called the victory ‚Äúa dream come true.‚Äù BYU's Director of Basketball Operations, Jeff Judkins (former Utah basketball star and assistant coach and later BYU's women's basketball coach), added: ‚ÄúIt feels just like Christmas!‚Äù :BYU 58, Utah 54 *February 23, 2002‚Äì Provo Just one minute into the second- half, Utah (19‚Äì5, 9‚Äì2) had built up a 21-point lead. But from there, BYU (16‚Äì8, 6‚Äì5), led by Matt Montague and Travis Hansen, outscored the Utes 34‚Äì14, including a 3-pointer by Montague to cut the Utah lead to one with 1:18 left. Less than a minute later, Montague found Eric Nielsen, whose 15-foot shot gave BYU their first lead of the game, and which proved to be the game winner. The win extended the Cougars' homecourt winning-streak to 35 games. :BYU 63, Utah 61 *January 25, 2003‚Äì Provo BYU (13‚Äì4, 2‚Äì0) had extended their homecourt winning-streak to 44 games, the nation's longest streak. Meanwhile, Utah (13‚Äì4, 1‚Äì1) entered Provo without coach Majerus, who was in Southern California attending the funeral for the stepfather of former Ute star Andre Miller. Both teams played extremely well and extremely close- where an 8-point Ute lead early in the game would be the largest lead for either team. For BYU, Travis Hansen had 21 points and 12 rebounds, Rafael Ara√∫jo had 19 points and nine rebounds, and Mark Bigelow added 16 points. However, it would not be enough to continue the streak. Utah's backup guard Marc Jackson scored 17 points to lead the Utes. With ice in his veins, he hit all 13 of his free throws, including four crucial attempts in the final 15 seconds of the game to seal the win. The Utes also got double-digit points from Tim Frost (16), Nick Jacobson (13), and Britton Johnsen (12). The win gave Utah a 117‚Äì116 series edge. :Utah 79, BYU 75 =Football= *October 10, 1942‚Äì Salt Lake City BYU (1‚Äì1, 0‚Äì1) finally beat Utah (0‚Äì2, 0‚Äì0) after going winless for the first 20 games of the rivalry. Down by two late in the fourth quarter, BYU blocked a punt, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Utah 10-yard line. Four plays later, BYU's Herman Longhurst ran in the winning touchdown from three yards out. Immediately after the game, Cougar fans stormed onto the field and tore down the goalposts, igniting a celebration that continued for three days. The following Monday, the Mayor of Provo formally proclaimed an official day of celebration. :BYU 12, Utah 7 *November 26, 1953‚Äì Salt Lake City: NBC was on hand to broadcast one of the first nationally televised college football games ever. Approximately 60 million viewers tuned in to watch the Thanksgiving Day event, in which Utah (7‚Äì2, 4‚Äì0) was favored to beat the Cougars (2‚Äì6‚Äì1, 0‚Äì4) by 24 points. BYU kept it close during the first half for a 13‚Äì13 halftime score, but in the third quarter Utah quickly jumped out to a 13-point lead and looked as though they might in fact cover the spread after all. However, BYU would stage a comeback- scoring two quick touchdowns to tie the game at 26. Utah took the lead again, as RB Don Peterson scored on a two-yard run to make the score 33‚Äì26. Then, with 90 seconds left in the game, BYU's QB Henry West completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to Phil Oyler. But the game-tying extra point attempt failed, and Utah escaped with a narrow win. :Utah 33, BYU 32 *November 18, 1978‚Äì Salt Lake City One year after Utah coach Wayne Howard waged a \\"crusade to beat BYU,\\" the Utes (5‚Äì3, 2‚Äì2) and Cougars (7‚Äì2, 5‚Äì0) squared off at Rice Stadium on a cold November afternoon. BYU's promising new QB, Jim McMahon, led the Cougars to a 16‚Äì0 halftime lead, and it appeared that BYU was headed for their seventh straight win over the Utes. But Utah would dominate the Cougars from then on, holding them to just 6 second-half points. Down by six with 3:30 left in the game, Utah faced a fourth-and-17 from the BYU 19. But Ute QB Randy Gomez would find WR Frank Henry wide open in the southwest corner of the endzone for the game-winning touchdown. It was Gomez's third touchdown pass on the day. :Utah 23, BYU 22 *November 19, 1988‚Äì Salt Lake City : The Rice Bowl Since Utah had last beat BYU in football, the Cougars had gone 104‚Äì24, won eight conference championships, and one national championship. The Utes (5‚Äì5, 3‚Äì4), who entered the game as 11-point underdogs, jumped out to a 21-point lead and never let up until the game was over and the goal posts had been torn down. Utah QB Scott Mitchell finished the day with 384 yards passing, and RB Eddie Johnson added 112 yards on the ground. BYU (8‚Äì2, 5‚Äì2), on the other hand, gave up eight turnovers, and suffered numerous game-ending injuries at key positions, including to QB Sean Covey. Local companies and fans capitalized on the victory by selling key chains made with pieces of the goal posts, and tee-shirts which proclaimed: \\"I was there: 57‚Äì28!\\" :Utah 57, BYU 28 *November 19, 1989‚Äì Provo : The Great Ute-shoot After the '88 \\"Rice Bowl\\" victory for the Utes, BYU fans had a mind for revenge prior to the '89 game in Provo. 66,110 fans filled the stadium for a game frequently overlooked by Utah fans which saw the two teams combine for over 100 points. Scott Mitchell who had passed for nearly 400 yards the year before could only watch from the sidelines as his understudy Mike Richmond struggled against BYU's defense. Before most fans were in their seats BYU had jumped out to a 14‚Äì0 lead. BYU held a 49‚Äì0 lead before the Utes would score their first touchdown in a game so lopsided BYU quarterback Ty Detmer was given permission to visit the restroom during the game. At halftime the score was 49‚Äì7. In the 4th quarter down 63‚Äì10 Utah would go on to score 3 touchdowns against BYU's defensive reserves. :BYU 70, Utah 31 *November 20, 1993‚Äì Provo: : 34‚Äì31, pt. I For the first time in 21 years, Utah (6‚Äì5, 4‚Äì3) beats BYU (5‚Äì4, 5‚Äì1) in Provo. With the game tied at 31, and only seconds remaining in the game, the Utes found themselves on the BYU 38-yard line, and with no option other than to send in their field goal kicker. Utah's kicker, Chris Yergensen, had already missed two out of three FGs on the day. And when he was not missing FGs, he was consulting with a sideline psychologist that the team had brought in for his benefit. Nevertheless, Yergensen was sent into the game and promptly kicked the game-winning 55-yard field goal (the longest of his career) as time expired. :Utah 34, BYU 31 *November 19, 1994‚Äì Salt Lake City: : 34‚Äì31, pt. II For the first time ever, both BYU and Utah entered the game ranked in the AP poll: BYU (9‚Äì2, 6‚Äì1) was #20 and Utah (8‚Äì2, 5‚Äì2) was #21. The game also featured six lead changes, including a 27-yard touchdown pass from John Walsh to Mike Johnston to put BYU ahead by four with 2:15 remaining. But Ute freshman Cal Beck returned the ensuing kickoff 67 yards to the Cougar 32; and three plays later, Utah QB Mike McCoy found RB Charlie Brown for a 20-yard touchdown strike with just 56 seconds left to retake the lead. In the final seconds of the game, BYU was able to move to ball all the way up to the Ute 34, but Utah's Bronzell Miller forced a fumble that teammate Luther Ellis recovered to preserve the win: 34‚Äì31... again. :Utah 34, BYU 31 *November 21, 1998‚Äì Salt Lake City: : ‚ÄúThe Doink Heard 'Round Utah‚Äù Once again, a close, hard-fought game goes down to the final seconds, and the outcome hinged on a single play. BYU (8‚Äì3, 6‚Äì1) was able to extend their lead to nine with an FG with 2:41 left in the game. However, Utah (7‚Äì3, 5‚Äì2) began a wild comeback when Daniel Jones returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards to cut the Cougar lead down to two. Then, after forcing BYU to punt on their next possession, Utah's offense promptly marched the ball down the Cougar 15-yard line to set up the potential game-winning field goal. But Utah's Ryan Kaneshiro's 32-yard field goal attempt bounced audibly off the right goalpost as time expired. The term \\"doink\\" comes from the description of the play given to local media outlets by former Cougar QB Steve Sarkisian who was on the BYU sideline during the game. :BYU 26, Utah 24 *November 24, 2000‚Äì Salt Lake City: : ‚ÄúLaVell's Last Miracle‚Äù Both the Utes (4‚Äì6, 3‚Äì3) and Cougars (5‚Äì6, 3‚Äì3) were finishing unremarkable seasons, but this game stood significant in the fact that BYU's coach LaVell Edwards had recently announced his retirement, making the game his last. His Cougar team led 26‚Äì10 at the end of the third quarter, but the night was just getting started. The Utes scored 17 points during the fourth quarter, including a 20-yard touchdown pass from Darnell Arceneaux to Matt Nickle with 2:16 remaining. Leading by one point, Utah's defense had BYU pinned: fourth down and 13 yards to go from their own 17, and about one minute left. Appropriately, Edwards' last game would end in miraculous fashion. Cougar QB Brandon Doman found WR Jonathan Pittman for a 34-yard completion to sustain the drive. Then on the next play, Doman completed a 36-yard pass to Pittman. Two plays later, Doman ran in the winning touchdown with only 13 seconds left. :BYU 34, Utah 27 *November 17, 2001‚Äì Provo BYU was ranked #8, undefeated (10‚Äì0, 6‚Äì0), and hoping to become the first BCS non-AQ team ever to earn an invitation to a BCS bowl. However, with 3¬Ω minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Cougars found themselves trailing 21‚Äì10 to Utah (7‚Äì2, 4‚Äì1) in front of packed crowd of 66,149. For the second year in a row, QB Brandon Doman engineered a dramatic late-game comeback against the Utes. This time, Doman led the Cougars 92 yards in 2:25, capped off with a seven-yard touchdown pass to star RB Luke Staley. Staley cut the Utah lead to three with a two-point conversion run. Then, after holding the Utah offense to a three-and-out, BYU got the ball back with 2:11 remaining...which was more time than they'd need. The Cougars quickly moved the ball up to the Utah 30, and with 1:16 left, Staley took a pitch from Doman and rushed down the sideline for the winning touchdown. Utah's final drive got as far as the BYU 30, but Jernaro Gilford intercepted a Lance Rice pass to seal the win. :BYU 24, Utah 21 *November 22, 2003‚Äì Provo : The Snow Bowl For the first time since 1957, Utah (8‚Äì2, 5‚Äì1) clinches an outright conference championship; and they do it on the road, in a snowstorm, and against BYU (4‚Äì7, 3‚Äì3). Fans who braved the snow and 19 degree temperature were treated to a hard-fought defensive showdown. With 8:43 left in the second quarter, Utah's Bryan Borreson kicked a 41-yard field goal to put the Utes up 3‚Äì0. But that was all the points Utah would get that day...and all they would need. The Ute defense held two Cougar QBs to a combined total of 41 yards passing, and only allowed BYU's offense to cross the 50-yard line once the entire game. And while the Utah offense was less than stellar itself, it did manage to win the time of possession battle by over 13 minutes. It was the first time in 361 straight games that BYU was held scoreless in a game (ending an NCAA record), and the first time in 33 years that they were shut out at home. :Utah 3, BYU 0 Utah Utes fans rush the field and carry the goalpost after defeating rival BYU, completing a perfect regular season, and becoming the first BCS Buster by clinching a spot in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl (hence the sombrero). *November 20, 2004‚Äì Salt Lake City: : ‚ÄúBCS Busters‚Äù The Utes (10‚Äì0, 6‚Äì0) were ranked #6 in the Coaches' Poll, #5 in the AP, and on the verge of being guaranteed the first-ever BCS bowl berth for a BCS non-AQ team. The Cougars (5‚Äì5, 4‚Äì2) kept pace with the Utes through the first half, and twice intercepted passes from Alex Smith (who had been intercepted only two times in the ten games prior). The Utes outscored the Cougars 31‚Äì7 in the second half to secure the win, and sombrero-clad fans (expecting a Fiesta Bowl invitation) rushed the field as time expired. This was both Gary Crowton's and Urban Meyer's final regular season game as head coach of their respective programs. :Utah 52, BYU 21 *November 19, 2005‚Äì Provo BYU (6‚Äì4, 5‚Äì2) was headed to their first bowl game in four years, had clinched at least a second-place conference finish, and fans were reeling with excitement about BYU's apparent return to their glory days. Utah (5‚Äì5, 3‚Äì4), on the other hand, came into the game with a disappointing record, and was forced to start Brett Ratliff, an inexperienced JC-transfer, at quarterback after starter Brian Johnson went down with a season-ending injury the week before. To everyone's surprise, Utah jumped out to a quick first-half lead. However, BYU would come back, scoring 21 third-quarter points, and forcing overtime for the first time in the series history. In OT, Ratliff hit Travis LaTendresse for a 25-yard touchdown strike. On BYU's ensuing possession, QB John Beck's fourth-down pass landed incomplete in the back of the endzone, just beyond the outstretched arms of Todd Watkins. :Utah 41, BYU 34 (OT) *November 25, 2006‚Äì Salt Lake City BYU (9‚Äì2, 7‚Äì0) went into this game undefeated in conference play and enjoying their most successful season in years. After gaining a 14-point first quarter lead, BYU began to fall behind. Utah (7‚Äì4, 5‚Äì2) took the lead 31‚Äì27 with 1:19 left in the game. The cougar offense mounted an impressive 70-yard drive to the Utah 14-yard line. With the game clock displaying zeros, John Beck's completed an 11-yard pass across his body to a wide-open Jonny Harline who caught the ball in the end zone on his knees to win the rivalry for the first time in 4 years. :BYU 33, Utah 31 *November 24, 2007‚Äì Provo Both #23 BYU (8‚Äì2, 6‚Äì0) and Utah (8‚Äì3, 5‚Äì2) entered this game with high hopes riding large winning streaks. The game started off slow as two top 20 defenses displayed their talent by forcing several punts and turnovers. By halftime, the BYU offense had kicked into gear and had racked up 176 yards to Utah's 33. However, their lead was only 3‚Äì0. BYU held the lead until the first touchdown of the game was scored by Utah with 94 seconds remaining in the game, at which point the score was 10‚Äì9. Shortly thereafter, the Cougars were facing a 4th-and-18 on their own 12-yard line and were in need of a miracle to avoid a loss in a game they had dominated on the stat sheet. At this point a scrambling Max Hall completed a 49-yard pass to Austin Collie. The drive was capped by an 11-yard touchdown run by Harvey Unga and BYU held on to secure an outright MWC conference championship. :BYU 17, Utah 10 *November 22, 2008‚Äì Salt Lake City : ‚ÄúFirst Team to Bust the BCS Twice‚Äù Both teams entered highly ranked with Utah (11‚Äì0, 7‚Äì0) at 7/8 and BYU (10‚Äì1, 6‚Äì1) 14/16. The cougars were hoping to upset the 7th ranked Utes. Playing for a second BCS berth in five seasons, Utah needed to win the Holy War to finish 12‚Äì0 and earn a BCS bowl. After Utah jumped out to a first half lead, BYU came storming back to draw it to 27‚Äì24 in the 3rd quarter; however, Ute defensive end Paul Kruger intercepted BYU quarterback Max Hall as the Cougars were driving to take the lead, which proved to be a vital turning point in the game. Hall finished the game with 5 interceptions and a fumble and the Utes went on to win 48‚Äì24, finishing their season undefeated for the second time in five seasons. :Utah 48, BYU 24 *November 28, 2009‚Äì Provo BYU and Utah both came in with successful seasons, building up anticipation between the fans. The Utes took an early lead, 6‚Äì0, but the Cougars quickly responded, scoring the next 20 points to take the lead 20‚Äì6. The Utes came back in the fourth quarter and tied the game, sending it to overtime. Utah had the first overtime possession, scoring a field goal and bringing the score to 23‚Äì20. On BYU's possession, Max Hall threw the ball to Andrew George, who caught the ball and dodged two Utes tacklers, Joe Dale and Stevenson Sylvester, who collided, and George completed the touchdown. :BYU 26, Utah 23 (OT) *November 27, 2010‚Äì Salt Lake City Utah entered the game ranked #22 but were coming off of critical losses in games versus Texas Christian University and Notre Dame after ascending to a #8 AP ranking in their final season in the Mountain West. BYU came in riding a four-game winning streak after starting the season 2‚Äì5. With Utah being outscored 13‚Äì0 in the first half the Utes made a push in the second and went up 17‚Äì16 with an Asiata run late in the game. The game hinged upon a final field goal attempt by BYU. The kick attempt was blocked by Brandon Burton, thus securing Utah's victory and another thrilling Holy War. :Utah 17, BYU 16 *September 17, 2011‚Äì Provo BYU and Utah both came in with losses the previous week to Texas and USC, respectively. Manned by QB Jake Heaps the BYU offense gave up seven turnovers and the defense allowed multiple large scoring plays and allowed 172 rushing yards to RB John White III culminating in a thoroughly dominating and lopsided 54‚Äì10 Utah win in front of a sold out LES. :Utah 54, BYU 10 *September 15, 2012‚Äì Salt Lake City With Utah joining the Pac-12 Conference and BYU going independent in 2010, this was the second year the teams had not played in the same division since 1922. The teams recently announced that they will play in 2013 and 2016 but skip the 2014 and 2015 seasons. This will end a 67-year straight \\"Holy War\\" mach up. The game was tied 7:7 at the half. In the 3rd quarter, Utah scored 17 unanswered points. BYU managed to close the gap in the 4th quarter, scoring 14 unanswered points of their own. With only a few seconds left on the clock, a BYU pass was tipped and fell short of its receiver. The clock showed 0:00 and the Ute fans rushed the field. On further review, it was found that there was in fact 1 second left as the ball hit the ground, allowing for one more BYU play. With a chance to tie the score, BYU attempted a field goal which was blocked by Utah. The fans, who had not exited the field fully to the stands, again rushed the field prematurely. The ball was still live and BYU attempted to run the ball but was unsuccessful. Because there were fans on the field during the play, a \\"live ball\\" foul was awarded to BYU, who again had a chance to tie the game with better field position. This time BYU's kick sailed above Utah's defense and had enough height to make the distance, but hit the goal's upright and bounced back into the field. The game was now officially over. :Utah 24, BYU 21 *September 21, 2013‚Äì Provo Utah entered the game 2‚Äì1 with an overtime loss in their conference opener to Oregon State the week before. BYU was fresh off a surprising beat down of Texas which brought the cougars record to 1‚Äì1. Utah took control defensively in the first half, shutting out the Cougars 13‚Äì0 with a variety of explosive plays. BYU was able to rebound in the second half with two drives that ended in field goals; however, Utah drove the field and scored a touchdown to make the score 20‚Äì6. BYU kept it close by scoring their first touchdown and only red-zone score of the game. BYU got the ball for one last chance at tying the game but were unsuccessful. :Utah 20, BYU 13 *December 19, 2015 ‚Äì Las Vegas :\\"The Holy War in Sin City\\"' The two-season hiatus of the rivalry was cut short when BYU and Utah received invitations to play the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl. Utah would score five touchdowns in the first quarter, securing a 35‚Äì0 lead. Utah would not score any further points, and BYU scored four touchdowns through the three remaining quarters. However, they were not enough to tie or overtake Utah. :Utah 35, BYU 28 *September 10, 2016 ‚Äì Salt Lake City The game started well with BYU and Utah each with points on the board after the first quarter. (Score of 7‚Äì6, favoring Utah) The next quarter brought on a touchdown for each teams, bringing the score up to 14‚Äì13. The third quarter did not bring much to the scoreboard other than a field goal made by Utah. In the fourth quarter, Utah scored another field goal bringing the score up to 20‚Äì13, and BYU scored a touchdown within the last few moments of the game. the touchdown (making the score 20‚Äì19), BYU tried for a 2-point conversion that could have won them the game. QB Taysom Hill had intentions of handing the ball off or passing, but a Utah defensive blitz caused him to keep the ball and rush towards the end zone. Hill was tackled at the three yard line, thus ending a 6th straight win for Utah over BYU. :Utah 20, BYU 19 *September 9, 2017 ‚Äì Provo Utah started off the game with a first-quarter field goal and during the second quarter scored a touchdown, leading at half with a 9‚Äì0 lead. BYU responded to the score with a touchdown, making the score 9‚Äì6. Utah, however, scored a touchdown and completed the PAT and a field goal as well later in the third quarter. The fourth quarter remained scoreless except for a BYU touchdown that included a completed PAT, thus creating a seventh straight win for Utah over BYU. :Utah 19, BYU 13 *November 24, 2018 ‚Äì Salt Lake City BYU came into the game with a 6‚Äì5 record on the season, and #17-ranked Utah came into the season with an 8‚Äì3 record. It seemed that BYU would start off horribly again as they had been all season, but the punt that followed the opening drive landed in the hands of a Utah special teams member, and was dropped. It was recovered by BYU and the drive that followed led to their first touchdown. With a 6‚Äì0 score because of a missed PAT, Utah was forced to punt on their next drive and BYU scored another touchdown within the next 2 minutes, creating a score of 13‚Äì0. Utah once again had to punt the ball with their next drive, giving BYU the ball. BYU scored, now leading 20‚Äì0. Utah punted on their next drive, followed by BYU punt. Now with the ball, Utah attempted a field goal, but it was blocked by BYU special teams member Khyris Tonga. With a BYU-favored score of 20‚Äì0 at the half, Utah responded with a pick-six thrown by BYU QB Zach Wilson. BYU then responded with another score, after receiving a short field due to a ten-yard Utah punt, making the score 27‚Äì7. During the fourth quarter, Utah proceeded to score 28 unanswered points, making a 35‚Äì27 lead. Attempting to come back from the 8-point lead that Utah had gained in the second half, BYU tried to rush the ball for a first on a fourth down and five.

Born as the son of a furniture manufacturer, Butler studied architecture at the Maryland Institute of Baltimore for three years beginning in 1888. At the Institute, Butler familiarized himself with fashionable architectural styles of the time like Richardsonian Romanesque and Queen Anne Architecture. Allegany County Courthouse in Cumberland, Maryland Upon his return to Cumberland in 1891, the young architect opened an office, working mainly on residential designs. In 1893, Butler received his first large commission, the Allegany County Courthouse. Other impressive Butler designs include: * the Cumberland Masonic Temple * the Cumberland Liberty Bank Building * the George Troug House. His designs still dominate the Cumberland skyline today. (Paul et al. 2003)  Wright Butler House  Constructed around 1896, the Wright Butler House is a unique example of Queen Anne architecture. Developed in England, the Queen Anne style first appeared in Rhode Island in 1874. American architectural magazines and pattern books quickly popularized the style. In England, architects used a combination of masonry and timber work, but most American Queen Anne homes are all-wood construction. Wright Butler's Queen Anne design therefore stands as an unusual masonry example of the style. Using the classic \\"asymmetrical\\" feel of most Queen Anne designs, the street view is dominated by a three bay window arrangement that juts out from the rest of the building. The three bay window, repeated on the second and third stories, creates the appearance of a \\"tower,\\" an oft repeated stylistic element in many Queen Anne buildings. The front porch is decorated with elaborate wooden spindle work. The Wright Butler House is currently a private residence and not open to the public.

Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA) is a multi-jurisdiction transportation agency providing transit bus and ADA Paratransit services in the City of Williamsburg, James City County, York County in the Historic Triangle area and Surry County, VA of the Virginia Peninsula subregion of Hampton Roads in southeastern Virginia. WATA operates 13 bus routes within the city and 2 counties, using a \\"hub and spoke\\" designed system using the intermodal Williamsburg Transportation Center and the James City County Walmart as hubs. Additionally, a connection to the City of Newport News and the Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) public transit bus system is provided on Route 1 serving U.S. Route 60 east by traveling into the western edge of Newport News and meeting 2 HRT's Routes at Lee Hall, Virginia. WATA also operates replica (rubber-tired) Trolley service (Route 14) between the College of William and Mary, High Street in Williamsburg, Virginia and New Town, James City County. History and service area Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA) is the successor to James City County Transit (JCCT), and \\"Williamsburg Area Transport\\" (WAT). JCCT began in 1977 as a James City County Social Services transportation system using flexible routes to serve those needing it most. The successful service grew into a public bus system serving multiple jurisdictions and the organization became Williamsburg Area Transport which was also governmentally operated by James City County in the community for many years. In the early 21st century, by changing from being known as James City County Transit to the newer name of \\"Williamsburg Area Transport\\", the scope and area of the current regional services were more accurately described as part of a new organizational structure authorized by the Virginia General Assembly. In 2008, \\"Williamsburg Area Transport\\" grew into the first Virginia \\"transit authority\\" branded as \\"Williamsburg Area Transit Authority\\". Bus stop sign from the Williamsburg Area Transport era. WATA services are operated within the City of Williamsburg, James City County, the Bruton District of York County and Surry County serving citizens and visitors to all four localities. Historic sites and extensive tourism form the basis for an unusual operating environment in comparison to similar sized localities elsewhere in Virginia and the United States. James City County and York County are each one of the eight original shires of Virginia formed in 1634, and are two of the oldest counties in Virginia as well as the present United States. The City of Williamsburg, long-located along the border of the two counties, was founded in 1623 as Middle Plantation, initially a fortified community midway across the Virginia Peninsula on high ground. It was selected as the site of the new College of William and Mary, a long-desired effort of the colonists which was established by a Royal Charter issued in 1693 by King William III and Queen Mary II, joint sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland. Several years later, partially due a persuasive presentation to the House of Burgesses by the Reverend Dr. James Blair and a group of his students, the tiny community was selected to replace the harsh weather and other environmental conditions at Jamestown and became the capital of the Colony of Virginia in 1698, renamed the following year in honor of King William. Williamsburg became the first chartered city in Virginia in 1722 during colonial times, and became an independent city under a change in Virginia's state constitution in 1871. The first mental health facility in the United States was established at Williamsburg in 1770, and its successor, Eastern State Hospital, a state-owned facility, continues to operate nearby in modern times. Beginning in 1926, the extensive restoration of a central part of Williamsburg to the era of the pre- American Revolutionary War era of the late 1780s was initially funded and led by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Their efforts and generous contributions and those of their descendants and many others resulted in the creation and initial endowment of Colonial Williamsburg. Rather than simply an effort to preserve the antiquity, the combination of extensive restoration and thoughtful recreation of the entire colonial town facilitates envisioning the atmosphere and embracing the ideals of the 18th century patriots. As a tangible birthplace of democracy, Colonial Williamsburg and the surrounding area developed into one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Another major historical point of the WATA service area includes Jamestown Settlement. Additionally, the WATA service area encompasses several prominent museums and other attractions including two major theme parks, hospitality businesses which include dozens of hotels and restaurants, and several shopping outlet complexes. The area has grown popular for resort complexes and as a choice for relocating retirees from other areas. The area also has large U.S. military complexes at Camp Peary, the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, and is adjacent to the U.S. Army base at Fort Eustis. Rounding out the community are as residential areas, schools, retail and industrial enterprises. Specific unincorporated communities within the WATA service area generally include: *Croaker *Diascund *Five Forks *Grove *Indigo Park *Jamestown *Kingspoint *Kingsmill (including Busch Gardens Williamsburg) *Lee Hall (just outside counties in Newport News) *Lightfoot *Norge *Toano *Yorktown Funding The services of Williamsburg Area Transit Authority are partially funded through rider fares, a form of user fees. The system is also subsidized by the partner local governments of the City of Williamsburg, James City County, and York County, as well as purchases of services by the College of William and Mary, Surry County, City of Newport News, Virginia, and Colonial Williamsburg,Williamsburg - dailypress.com and other community organizations. WATA also receives State and Federal financial assistance from the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDRPT) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Route system WATA operates what is often called a \\"hub and spoke\\" bus routing system. At designated intervals, the transit buses all meet at a coordinated time at a central location or Hub (in this instance the Williamsburg Transportation Center and Walmart), and then serve various outlying areas in many directions. The \\"Hub and Spoke\\" Route System does not include: * demand responsive paratransit service provided with smaller buses * Rubber-tired trolley replica buses operated on the short shuttle loops *William and Mary's Route 8 that serves the college campus * Surry (Route 13) bus service provides pre-scheduled route deviations within 3/4 of a mile from a bus stop. Williamsburg Transportation Center Six routes meet at the Williamsburg Transportation Center at the start of the hour. Located at a restored Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station owned by the City of Williamsburg in downtown Williamsburg, the Transportation Center not only serves WATA's regular routes, but also service: * Amtrak passenger rail * Greyhound Lines intercity bus service * Hampton Roads Transit (Route 121) * local taxicab and car rental services WATA route lines The WATA system serves eleven bus lines, most are color-coded. All route information is current as of October 2017. A WATA Bus and Trolley sign, with information to locate the next bus. * Route 1: Lee Hall: U.S. Route 60 between Williamsburg Transportation Center and Lee Hall (including Busch Gardens). Also serves Riverside Doctor's Hospital, Grove Community, Windy Hill, James River Commerce Park, Green Mount Industrial Park, and Lee Hall in Newport News, where a connection with Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) service is available. * Route 2: Richmond: U.S. Route 60 between Williamsburg Transportation Center and the Walmart store in Lightfoot. Serves as a connector for passengers transferring from or to either Purple Lines. * Route 8: W & M: Serves the College of William and Mary, Marshall-Wythe School of Law, and the School of Education * Route 4: Longhill: New Town to Walmart. Also serves Old Towne Medical Center and James City County Human Services Building. * Route 9: Toano: Storehouse Commerce Park in Toano to Walmart. Also serves Williamsburg Pottery Factory, Croaker public library, Burnt Ordinary Apartments, and Norge. * Route 3: Merrimac: Williamsburg Transportation Center to State Route 143 (Merrimack Trail) @ Tam-O-Shanter Blvd (serves Colonial Williamsburg Visitors Center), Capitol Landing Road, Marquis shopping center on State Route 199, and James- York Plaza Shopping Center. * Route 7: Mooretown: Williamsburg Transportation Center to the Lowe's/Walmart shopping center on East Mooretown Road. This line also serves Sentara Williamsburg Regional Medical Center and Great Wolf Lodge. * Route 5: Monticello: Williamsburg Transportation Center to Steeplechase Apartments, New Town, Williamsburg-James City County Courthouse complex, Monticello Marketplace shopping center (Target/Martin's grocery store). * Route 6: Jamestown: Williamsburg Crossing Shopping Center, Colony Square Shopping Center, Jamestown Settlement, John Tyler Hwy, Jamestown Road between Route 199 and Merchants Square, Williamsburg Transportation Center. * Route 13: Surry: Surry deviated-route bus service * Route 11: Lackey: Created in July 2017 to service Lackey Clinic, Riverside Hospital, Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail (VPRJ), Naval Weapons Station, and JCC Government Complex. Connects with Route 1 at Riverside Hospital stop. To help mitigate rush hour traffic and new delays due to heightened security measures on the Jamestown Ferry crossing the James River, in October 2007, WATA began Deviated route transit bus service from 5 stops in Surry County across the James River to limited stops at several major points in James City County and Williamsburg, terminating at the Williamsburg Transportation Center where connections are available with other WATA, HRT, and intercity services. As part of major route and schedule changes, in October 2016 Route 13 would terminate at Jamestown Settlement, where riders could catch Route 6: Jamestown to the Williamsburg Transportation Center. Surry County stops include Lebanon Apartments, Surry Apartments, Surry Government Center, Surry Community Center, and the VDOT Park and Ride lot near Scotland Wharf. A stop at the Surry branch of the Blackwater Regional Library was added in October 2016. =Route notes= #WATA implemented an intelligent transportation system (ITS), called BusTime for their customers and route management. This ITS (BusTime) system includes a phone and PC optimized web site to find out when the next bus will arrive at any stop, automated alert system based on actual bus location, texting service to determine actual next bus arrival times and text alerts. # WATA updates their stops and routes on a quarterly basis updating their ITS (BusTime) system and Google Maps. # Colonial Williamsburg - Many WATA lines serve the Colonial Williamsburg (CW) area. For service to the CW Visitors Center, riders should use WATA's Route 3: Merrimac route. # Possible Route 1 confusion - It is notable that Colonial Williamsburg, which operates its own fleet of grey and white colored transit buses and minibuses, also has a \\"Grey Line\\" route. This is not to be confused with WATA's Route 1 route for US Route 60 East which ends at Lee Hall. The WATA buses on that route are normally painted beige, white and burgundy in color, and clearly marked for WATA with the words \\"Williamsburg Area Transit Authority/WATA\\". # Yellow Line: WATA dropped this line in Spring 2012, due to overlap with service from Colonial Williamsburg. The line used to run from the Williamsburg Transportation Center to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. Passengers could catch the shuttle by riding Route 3 to the Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center. Fleet WATA's Gillig Low Floor BRT buses.

Also, Paratransit service is provided to eligible individuals not able to use the accessible fixed route bus system. Operating hours WATA bus services operates Monday - Saturday, with reduced service on Sundays. On most James City County holidays, WATA operates on a reduced schedule, with no service on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Years Day. Williamsburg Trolley In May 2008, Williamsburg Area Transit Authority announced that it had recently received a grant for three trolley-replica type buses that will serve the local shopping areas of New Town, High Street, Richmond Road, Jamestown Road, and Merchants Square in Colonial Williamsburg. The Williamsburg Trolley began service in August 2009. The event was marked with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at New Town. The trolley runs every day except on New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Each of the trolley cars feature ornamental wooden seating, a cheerful, two-toned red and blue exterior and bicycle racks. On warm days, the trolley has an open-air atmosphere. Trolley drivers also point out historic sites, restaurants, and must-visit attractions. Expansion and hub change In 2011, WATA expanded its services to include a storefront location in the Williamsburg Outlet Mall on Richmond Road. The center acts as a hub for public information and waiting areas for passengers, and will eventually include ticket and bus fare sales. This storefront location was moved to the Williamsburg Transportation Center in January 2014 due to the closing of the Outlet Mall. This change also coincided with the western hub moving to the Lightfoot Walmart store. Routes serving the Outlet Mall were modified to reflect the hub change, as well as extend service further out in Toano. In January 2015, WATA began a 3-year pilot route in the Jamestown area. The new Route 6:Jamestown route serves Jamestown Road, Jamestown Settlement, Greensprings Road, John Tyler Highway and travels on Rt. 199 back to Jamestown Rd. In October 2016, as a result of major route and schedule changes, Route 6 (Jamestown) added service to the Williamsburg Transportation Center via Jamestown Rd. Service was also discontinued along Greensprings Rd at that time. Route and schedule overhaul In June 2016 WATA proposed several changes to its routes and schedules to improve service. Several hearings were held to solicit public input on the changes. The proposed changes went into effect in October 2016. Among the schedule changes were the hours of 30-minute frequency service from 6:30am‚Äì9:30am and 3:30pm‚Äì6:30pm on weekdays. Routes 1 and 2 would also extend their hours to 11pm. Frequency service ended on Route 7: Mooretown route, reverting it to hourly service only.

While an atheist, Erixon has expressed enormous respect for Christian ethics and praised the cultural significance of Christianity in shaping Western civilization. On his blog, Erixon has made himself known as a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Bush Doctrine with its call for universal freedom to all and of the U.S. war on terror in general. He endorsed John McCain's candidacy in the 2008 United States Presidential Election, and has since shown strong support for the Tea Party movement. Since at least 2018, Erixon has renounced his once strong belief in interventionism, describing it as \\"an idealistic dream without contact with reality\\" which \\"only led the West to sacrifice soldiers in vain\\", and that the Iraq War in particular had a goal \\"which was impossible to achieve\\".http://erixon.com/blogg/2018/05/idealisten-bernard-lewis-blev-101-ar/  References   External links  *Dick Erixon, blog Category:1962 births Category:Swedish male writers Category:Swedish anti-communists Category:Swedish bloggers Category:Centre Party (Sweden) politicians Category:Swedish libertarians Category:Living people Category:Male bloggers ","title":"Dick Erixon"},{"id":"5626283","text":"Generative anthropology is a field of study based on the theory that the origin of human language was a singular event and that the history of human culture is a genetic or \\"generative\\" development stemming from the development of language. In contrast to more common theories that examine human culture in terms of a multiplicity of complex cultural differences, generative anthropology attempts to understand cultural phenomena in the simplest terms possible: all things human are traced back to a hypothetical single origin point at which human beings first used signs to communicate. Eric Gans and the origin of generative anthropology Generative Anthropology originated with Professor Eric Gans of UCLA who developed his ideas in a series of books and articles beginning with The Origin of Language: A Formal Theory of Representation (1981), which builds on the ideas of Ren√© Girard, notably that of mimetic desire. However, in establishing the theory of Generative Anthropology, Gans departs from and goes beyond Girard's work in many ways. Generative Anthropology is therefore an independent and original way of understanding the human species, its origin, culture, history, and development. =Anthropoetics= Gans founded (and edits) the web-based journal Anthropoetics: The Journal of Generative Anthropology as a scholarly forum for research into human culture and origins based on his theories of Generative Anthropology and the closely related theories of fundamental anthropology developed by Ren√© Girard. In his online Chronicles of Love and Resentment Gans applies the principles of Generative Anthropology to a wide variety of fields including popular culture, film, post-modernism, economics, contemporary politics, the Holocaust, philosophy, religion, and paleo- anthropology. The originary hypothesis of human language The central hypothesis of generative anthropology is that the origin of language was a singular event. Human language is radically different from animal communication systems. It possesses syntax, allowing for unlimited new combinations and content; it is symbolic, and it possesses a capacity for history. Thus it is hypothesized that the origin of language must have been a singular event, and the principle of parsimony requires that it originated only once. Language makes possible new forms of social organization radically different from animal \\"pecking order\\" hierarchies dominated by an alpha male. Thus, the development of language allowed for a new stage in human evolution ‚Äì the beginning of culture, including religion, art, desire, and the sacred. As language provides memory and history via a record of its own history, language itself can be defined via a hypothesis of its origin based on our knowledge of human culture. As with any scientific hypothesis, its value is in its ability to account for the known facts of human history and culture. =Mimetic behaviour= Mimetic (imitatory) behaviour connects proto-hominid species with humans. Imitation is an adaptive learning behavior, a form of intelligence favored by natural selection. Imitation, however, as Ren√© Girard observes, leads to conflict when two individuals imitate each other in their attempt to appropriate a desired object. The problem is to explain the transition from one form of mimesis, imitation, to another, representation. Although many anthropologists have hypothesized that language evolved to help humans describe their world, this ignores the fact that intra-species violence, not the environment, poses the greatest threat to human existence. Human representation, according to Gans, is not merely a \\"natural\\" evolutionary development of animal communication systems, but is a radical departure from it. The signifier implies a symbolic dimension that is not reducible to empirical referents. =The originary event= At the event of the origin of language, there was a proto-human hominid species which had gradually become more mimetic, presumably in response to environmental pressures including climate changes and competition for limited resources. Higher primates have dominance hierarchies which serve to limit and prevent destructive conflict within the social group. However, as individuals within the proto-human group became more mimetic, the dominance system broke down and became inadequate to control the threat of violence posed by conflictual mimesis. Gans asks us to imagine an \\"originary event\\" along the following lines: A group of hominids have surrounded a food object, e.g. the body of a large mammal following a hunt. The attraction of the object, however, exceeds the limits of simple appetite due to the operation of group mimesis, essentially an expression of competition or rivalry. The object becomes more attractive simply because each member of the group finds it attractive: each individual in the group observes the attention that his rivals give the object. Actual appetite is artificially inflated through this mutual reinforcement. The power of appetitive mimesis in conjunction with the threat of violence is such that the central object begins to assume a sacred aura ‚Äì infinitely desirable and infinitely dangerous. Mimesis thus gives rise to a pragmatic paradox: the double imperative to take the desired object for personal gain, and to refrain from taking it to avoid conflict. In other words, imitating the rival means not imitating the rival, because imitation leads to conflict, the attempt to destroy rather than imitate (Gans, Signs of Paradox 18). Generative Anthropology theorizes that when this mimetic instinct becomes so powerful that it seems to possess a sacred force endangering the survival of the group, the resultant intra- species pressure favours the emergence of the sign. No member of the group is able to take the sacred object, and at least one member of the group intends this aborted gesture as a sign designating the central object. This meaning is successfully communicated to the group, who follow suit by reading their aborted gestures as signs also. The sign focuses attention on the sacred power of the central object, which is conceived as the source of its own power. The object which compels attention yet prohibits consumption can only be represented. The basic advantage of the sign over the object is that \\"The sign is an economical substitute for its inaccessible referent. Things are scarce and consequently objects of potential contention; signs are abundant because they can be reproduced at will\\" (Gans, Originary Thinking 9). The desire for the object is mediated by the sign, which paradoxically both creates desire, by attributing significance to the object, yet also defers desire, by designating the object as sacred or taboo. The mimetic impulse is sublimated, expressed in a different form, as the act of representation. Individual self- consciousness is also born at this moment, in the recognition of alienation from the sacred center. The primary value/function of the sign in this scenario is ethical, as the deferral of violence, but the sign is also referential. What the sign refers to, strictly speaking, is not the physical object, but rather the mediated object of desire as realized in the imagination of each individual. The emergence of the sign is only a temporary deferral of violence. It is immediately followed by the sparagmos, the discharge of the mimetic tension created by the sign in the violent dismemberment and consumption of the worldly incarnation of the sign, the central appetitive object. The violence of the sparagmos is mediated by the sign and thus directed towards the central object rather than the other members of the group. By including the sparagmos in the originary hypothesis, Gans intends to incorporate Girard's insights into scapegoating and the sacrificial (see Signs of Paradox 131‚Äì151). The \\"scene of representation\\" is fundamentally social or interpersonal. The act of representation always implies the presence of another or others. The use of a sign evokes the communal scene of representation, structured by a sacred center and a human periphery. The significance of the sign seems to emerge from the sacred center (in its resistance to appropriation), but the pragmatic significance of the sign is realized in the peace brokered amongst the humans on the periphery. All signs point to the sacred, that which is significant to the community. The sacred cannot be signified directly, since it is essentially an imaginary or ideal construction of mimetic desire. The significance is realized in the human relationships as mediated by the sign. When an individual refers to an object or idea, the reference is fundamentally to the significance of that object or idea for the human community. Language attempts to reproduce the non-violent presence of the community to itself, even though it may attempt to do so sacrificially, by designating a scapegoat victim. Generative Anthropology is so called because human culture is understood as a \\"genetic\\" development of the originary event. The scene of representation is a true cultural universal, but it must be analyzed in terms of its dialectical development. The conditions for the generation of significance are subject to historical evolution, so that the formal articulation of the sign always includes a dialogical relationship to past forms. Generative Anthropology Society and Conference The Generative Anthropology Society & Conference (GASC) is a scholarly association formed for the purpose of facilitating intellectual exchange amongst those interested in fundamental reflection on the human, originary thinking, and Generative Anthropology, including support for regular conferences. GASC was formally organized on June 24, 2010 at Westminster College, Salt Lake City during the 4th Annual Generative Anthropology Summer Conference. Further information, including how to join, can be found at the Generative Anthropology Society & Conference Website. Since 2007, Generative Anthropology Society & Conference (GASC) has held an annual summer conference on Generative Anthropology. 2007 - Kwantlen University College of University of British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia) 2008 - Chapman University (Orange, California) 2009 - University of Ottawa (Ottawa, Ontario) 2010 - Westminster College (Utah) (Salt Lake City) and Brigham Young University (Provo, Utah) 2011 - High Point University (High Point, North Carolina) 2012 - International Christian University (Tokyo, Japan) 2013 - University of California, Los Angeles 2014 - University of Victoria (Greater Victoria, British Columbia), Canada 2015 - High Point University (High Point, North Carolina) 2016 - Kinjo Gakuin University (Nagoya, Japan) See also * Memetics * Post-postmodernism Bibliography =Books by Eric Gans= The Origin of Language: A Formal Theory of Representation.

Early life and career Born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1899, Reynolds first worked in films at age 12. She began as a dancer, worked as one of the Sennett Bathing Beauties, and became a leading lady in silent motion pictures. Among her film credits are starring roles in Sam Wood's Prodigal Daughters (1923), and Cecil B. DeMille's Feet of Clay (1924), The Golden Bed (1925), The Road to Yesterday (1925) and Dragnet Patrol (1931) with George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes. Controversy On August 28, 1927, police in Hollywood reported that Reynolds had taken poison. Later the same evening she clarified what had occurred. She explained that an excited telephone operator had phoned the police when her mother requested a doctor. The police arrived along with an ambulance. The actress was found unconscious on the floor of a bathroom in her Hollywood home. Police responded initially to moans from the actress's mother who was outside the bathroom. When the door was opened they found the younger woman writhing in pain. Reynolds' mother believed her daughter had taken the poison by mistake, believing it to be medicine. Despite the actress's protestations she was transported to the emergency room and given emergency treatment. The attending physician said that he failed to find any trace of poison. Instead he thought Reynolds may have suffered an attack brought on by acute indigestion or ptomaine poisoning. Police had discovered a half-filled bottle of poison in the bathroom which led to their initial conclusion. Vera, upon returning to her home, described the initial report as \\"ridiculous\\"; saying \\"I have too much to live for.\\" She said, \\"Life is indeed very sweet and I am certainly not ready to end it yet.\\" Marriages She married twice: *To comedian Earl Montgomery; they divorced in 1926. *To Robert Ellis du Reel (1892‚Äì1974). In March 1938, Reynolds brought a breach of promise suit against Reel was reported. She sued Reel for $150,000, and contended she lived with Reel for nine years before she learned that they were not married. The suit claimed he promised to marry her, but failed to do so. During a recess in the trial Hollywood film director Robert G. Vignola, who believed the case could be reconciled out of court, assumed the role of peacemaker. Reynolds claimed to have had a marriage ceremony with Reel in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1926. Reel denied there had been a wedding, and stated the two had lived together unmarried. He remarked they \\"had the edge\\" on their unhappy married friends. Death Reynolds died in Hollywood on April 22, 1962, aged 62, at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She was buried in Valhalla Memorial Park, North Hollywood.

As a junior, he started in all 12 games, posting 56 tackles, 4 interceptions (tied for second in the conference), 10 passes defensed (second on the team), 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries (tied for the team lead). As a senior, he appeared in all 13 games with 10 starts, registering 77 tackles (third on the team) and 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He finished his college career after playing in 49 straight games (23 starts) at both safety and cornerback, while recording 10 interceptions. Professional career =Pre-draft= At the NFL Scouting Combine in February 2006, Watkins measured in at 6-foot-5 and 211 pounds, while posting a 40-yard-dash times of 4.42 seconds. =Dallas Cowboys= Watkins was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (138th overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he appeared in 14 games with 9 starts. He registered 49 tackles (led rookies in the NFL), 3 interceptions (second among rookies in the NFL), 6 passes defensed, 4 special teams tackles, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery.

A worldwide family of roughly 2,500 species, they are small, some with wing length of 1 mm. The maximum size is 6.5 mm. Most species are in the range of 2 to 3 mm. General description Adult agromyzids can be recognized by the distinctive sclerotization of the head. The upper part of the frons, above the ptilinal suture (known as the frontal vitta) is lightly sclerotized and lacks setae, while the lower part of the frons and the dorsal area of the head tends to be much more heavily sclerotized and setaceous. Thus, the frontal vitta often forms a distinctive patch on the head, different in colour and texture from the rest of the head. The compound eyes are usually oval and fairly small, although in some species, they are larger and more circular. Larval mines of holly leaf miner, Phytomyza ilicis The wings are usually hyaline, although those of a few tropical species have darker markings. A few species, including all Agromyza spp., are capable of stridulation, possessing a \\"file\\" on the first abdominal segment and a \\"scraper\\" on the hind femur. The family Agromyzidae is commonly referred to as the leaf-miner flies, for the feeding habits of their larvae, most of which are leaf miners on various plants. Figure 3 Cerodontha denticornis, 3a head lateral, 3b antenna, and figure 5 Phytomyza affinis 5a head lateral, 5b face, 5c antenna Technical description For terms see Morphology of Diptera These are small, sometimes minute, flies, at most 0.9 to 6.0 mm in length. The body is usually short, and the thorax has a rectangular profile, with a well- developed humeral callus. The abdomen is broad and the legs are short. The thorax and abdomen are often light grey, rarely dark, but may be yellow, green, blue-green, and variably coppery or metallic. The wings are equal in length to the body or slightly longer. Wings have the lower calypter much reduced or absent. The chaetotaxy is well developed, especially on the head. The postvertical orbital bristles on the head are always present and divergent, inner and outer vertical bristles on the head are well developed. They have ocellar bristles, frontal bristles (two to eight pairs of frontal bristles, the lower one to three pairs curve inward, the other pairs backward), vibrissae (in some cases weakly developed), and oral bristles are always present. Interfrontal bristles are absent, but interfrontal setulae are sometimes present. The basal segment of the antennae is very short; the second antennal segment is not grooved. The third antennal segment is always large, usually round (not elongated but sometimes with a sharp point) and usually with swollen, and the almost bare or pubescent arista never is plumose. The face in lateral view is not deeply excavated between the antennae and the edge of the mouth. The ptilinal suture is clearly defined. The mouthparts are functional. The proboscis is usually short and thick, rarely elongated and geniculated (Ophiomyia). The maxillary palps are single-segmented and porrect. The thorax is without a continuous dorsal suture and without well-defined posterior calli. The thorax has well-developed dorsocentral bristles, posterior bristles, supra-alar bristles, and acrostichal and intra-alar bristles. The scutellum has two to four bristles. On each side of the thorax is a humeral bristle and one or two notopleural bristles. In describing the bristles of the thorax (dorsocentral bristles and acrostichal), a formula is used in which the first number indicates the postsutural ones, and the second number, following a plus (+) or minus (-) sign the presutural. A few bristles are on the legs, but bristles on tibia 2, are of taxonomic significance. Tibiae are without a dorsal preapical bristle. Hind tibiae are without strong bristles in the basal 4/5. The front femora are without a conspicuous spine beneath. The wing venation usually exhibits first and second basal, anal, and discal cells but may lack one or more of the cells. Wings have a discal cell, or are without a discal cell; without a subapical cell. The anal cell is very short and closed. The costa has one break which is at the end of the subcosta. The subcosta is apparent (faint) and joins vein 1 well short of the costa, or terminates before it (vein Sc is complete or incomplete, apically ending in vein R1 (Agromyzinae) or separate from vein R1, but reduced to a fold that may or may not reach the costa (Phytomyzinae)); . Wing vein 4 extends far beyond the end of the first basal cell. Wing vein 6 is present, falling short of the wing margin. Wing venation is shown in the gallery. The abdomen is moderately long and consists of six segments and with a coating of short pubescence well- developed at some places. The female has an elongated telescopic ovipositor, which in the resting position is retracted into the elongated tergite 7, often called the ovipositor. (Female with oviscape, nonretractable basal segment of the ovipositor).

The larva is apodous, cylindrical and tapering at both ends. The length of the last instar larva is, as a rule, in the order of 2‚Äì3 mm. The tracheal system is metapneustic in the first instar early age and amphipneustic in the subsequent stages. The pupa is variable, from barrel shaped, to a more elongated shape. The outer surface can segmentation and is more or less smooth or wrinkled. The color varies from black to brown to yellowish white. Biology Melanagromyza sp. ovipositing on Anthriscus sylvestris Agromyzidae larvae are phytophagous, feeding as leaf miners, less frequently as stem miners or stem borers. A few live on developing seeds, or produce galls. Sometimes larvae in roots or under bark. The biology of many species is as yet unknown. There is a high degree of host specificity, an example being Phytomyza ilicis, the holly leaf miner that feeds on no other species. Some Agromyzidae are quarantine species in many countries. Liriomyza huidobrensis, Liriomyza sativae and Liriomyza trifolii are examples. A number of species attack plants of agricultural or ornamental value, so are considered pests. These insects are very important to agronomy by the direct damage that they cause, particularly on young plants, the leaf of which may, for example, be completely destroyed. By their nutritional bites females of some species are able to inoculate pathogenic fungi, or to transmit viruses. About 10% of the species of Agromyzidae are considered pests. The most important pest genera are Agromyza, Melanagromyza, Ophiomyia, Liriomyza, Napomyza and Phytomyza. For examples of pest species see Asparagus miner (Ophiomyia simplex),Chromatomyia horticola, Serpentine leaf miner (Liriomyza brassicae), and American serpentine leaf miner (Liriomyza trifolii). Some 110 species are known to occur on cultivated plants. A number of species are of particular importance, especially Liriomyza and Ophiomyia species. Larvae of species in the genera Liriomyza and Phytomyza are extremely polyphagous (they attack many different species of plants). A long imaginal aestivation and hibernation period is an uncommon overwintering strategy among agromyzid flies. The shape of the mine is often characteristic of the species and therefore useful for identification. For some of the serpentine leaf miners it is possible to use the mine to indicate the instar of the animal that made it, and in some cases its cause of death. Polytene chromosomes can be isolated from some agromyzid larvae. Adults occur in a variety of habitats, depending on the larval host plants. Identification Morphological similarity makes identification difficult, and DNA barcoding is increasingly used to identify species.

Reach should not be confused with the number of people who will actually be exposed to and consume the advertising, though. It is just the number of people who are exposed to the medium and therefore have an opportunity to see or hear the ad or commercial. Reach may be stated either as an absolute number, or as a fraction of a given population (for instance 'TV households', 'men' or 'those aged 25‚Äì35'). For any given viewer, they have been \\"reached\\" by the work if they have viewed it at all (or a specified amount) during the specified period. Multiple viewings by a single member of the audience in the cited period do not increase reach; however, media people use the term effective reach to describe the quality of exposure. Effective reach and reach are two different measurements for a target audience who receive a given message or ad. Since reach is a time-dependent summary of aggregate audience behavior, reach figures are meaningless without a period associated with them: an example of a valid reach figure would be to state that \\"[example website] had a one-day reach of 1565 per million on 21 March 2004\\" (though unique users, an equivalent measure, would be a more typical metric for a website). Reach of television channels is often expressed in the form of \\"x minute weekly reach\\" ‚Äì that is, the number (or percentage) of viewers who watched the channel for at least x minutes in a given week. For example, in the UK, BARB defines the reach of a television channel as the percentage of the population in private households who view a channel for more than 3 minutes in a given day or week. Similarly, for radio, RAJAR defines the weekly reach of a radio station as the number of people who tune into a radio station for at least 5 minutes (within at least one 15 min period) in a given week. Reach is an important measure for the BBC, which is funded by a mandatory licence fee. It seeks to maximise its reach to ensure all licence fee payers are receiving value. Reach and frequency of exposure are also two of the most important statistics used in advertising management. When reach is multiplied by average frequency a composite measure called gross rating points (GRPs) is obtained. Reach can be calculated indirectly as: reach = GRPs / average frequency.

Romanelli was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He is a seventh-generation sculptor, and his family is so well known in Italy that a museum there is dedicated to his family's sculptural works. Romanelli's sculpture of Elvis Presley, on display at the Las Vegas Hilton in 2009 Romanelli designed artware in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. For a time, he created artwork for the Works Project Administration. Lamps, plates and pottery designed by him were issued by Maddux of California, Incolay Studios Metroluxas well as Metlox Pottery of California in Manhattan Beach. At Metlox, he designed (holds Patent) various glassware and pottery. In the 1960s and 1970s, he turned toward life-size statues of people, many of them designed to be displayed outdoors. Among his more notable public works are a statue of St. Michael outside St. Michael's Church in Los Angeles; a statue of St. Vincent de Paul in Los Angeles; and a modern art piece outside Temple Shaarei Tikvah in Arcadia, California. He also designed (but did not execute) the Joseph Scott statue outside the Stanley Mosk Courthouse building of the Los Angeles Superior Court. His most famous work is a likeness of Elvis Presley outside the Las Vegas Hilton hotel. The statue was dedicated on September 8, 1978, and stood outside the property in a glass case for 28 years. In 2005, the statue was placed in storage while the facility underwent renovation. It was placed back on public display in 2006 in a courtyard inside the hotel. At one point, the statue was insured for a sizeable $1.5 million. Romanelli also was the sculptor for the Al Jolson Memorial Shrine at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

Taxonomy Until recently, it was only known from a single lectotype specimen mistakenly thought to have been collected on the Farasan Islands in the Red Sea in 1825. A 2013 genetic study of the lectotype specimen revealed that skull and skin do not stem from the same individual but belong to two distinct lineages of the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), necessitating restriction of the lectotype to the skin to conserve nomenclatural stability. A later study formalized the use of Gazella arabica for the Arabian lineage of the mountain gazelle, and synonymized Gazella erlangeri with G. arabica.B√§rmann, E.

There are many environmental factors affecting the population density of Arabian gazelles, such as human hunting, predation, competition, and climate change. The decline in population is due to human disturbances such as construction and illegal hunting. Other factors include temperature change, and predation (mainly by wolves); as the researchers stated in their findings that, ‚ÄúWolf encounter rate had a significant negative effect on G. arabica population size, while G. dorcas population size had a significant positive effect, suggesting that wolf predation shapes the population size of both gazelle species (Shalmon, B., Sun, P. & Wronski, T., 2020). http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=GeneralSearch&qid;=23&SID;=5AYg1Uqqiusm1vVugRr&page;=1&doc;=10 http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=GeneralSearch&qid;=19&SID;=5AYg1Uqqiusm1vVugRr&page;=1&doc;=2 See also *List of mammals of Saudi Arabia *Saudi gazelle References Shalmon, B., Sun, P. & Wronski, T.

Its distributional range is in Europe along the shores of Baltic Sea, North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. In the Mediterranean and at dry inland places it is replaced by Kali tragus (syn. Salsola tragus or Salsola kali subsp. tragus), which is less tolerant to salty soils, and has spread from Eurasia to other continents. Kali turgidum does not seem to occur as an introduced species in America.  Systematics  The species was first described in 1753 as Salsola kali by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum. Until 2007, it belonged to genus Salsola (sensu lato), but after molecular genetical research, this genus was split, and the species was placed into genus Kali Mill. (Syn.: Salsola sect. Kali Dum.). In genus Kali, the valid name is Kali turgidum (Dumort.) Guterm. (incorrectly as \\"turgida\\", Basionym: Salsola turgida Dumort., Fl. Belgica 23, 1827). The name Kali soda Moench used by Akhani et al. (2007) is invalid because of the older name Kali soda Scop. (a synonym of Salsola soda). Kali turgidum belongs to tribe Salsoleae s. str. Kali turgidum, Kali tragus, and other closely related species form a species complex (Kali tragus-aggregate or formerly Salsola kali-aggregate). Some authors treat these species only on subspecies level. Then Kali tragus would be the valid name for the whole species complex, and Kali turgidum would be a subspecies of it. In 2014, Mosyakin et al. proposed to conserve Salsola kali (= Kali turgidum) as nomenclatoral type for the genus Salsola. If the proposal will be accepted, all species of genus Kali would belong to Salsola again.  Alkali and soda ash  The plant is a halophyte, i.e. it grows where the water is salty, and the plant is a succulent, i.e. it holds much salty water. When the plant is burned, the sodium in the salt ends up in the chemical sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate has a number of practical uses, including especially as an ingredient in making glass, and making soap. In the medieval and early modern centuries the Kali plant and others like it were collected at tidal marshes and seashores. The collected plants were burned. The resulting ashes were mixed with water. Sodium carbonate is soluble in water. Non-soluble components of the ashes sunk to the bottom of the water container. The water with the sodium carbonate dissolved in it was then transferred to another container, and then the water was evaporated off, leaving behind the sodium carbonate. Another major component of the ashes that is soluble in water is potassium carbonate. The resulting product consisted mainly of a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. This product was called \\"soda ash\\" (was also called \\"alkali\\"). Soda ash extracted from the ashes of Kali turgidum/Kali tragus contains as much as 30% sodium carbonate. The soda ash was used primarily to make glass (secondly used as a cleaning agent). Another notable halophilic plant that was collected for the purpose was Salsola soda. Another was Halogeton sativus. Historically in the late medieval and early post-medieval centuries the word \\"Kali\\" could refer to any such plants. (The words \\"alkali\\" and \\"kali\\" come from the Arabic word for soda ash, al-qali). Today such plants are also called saltworts, referring to their relatively high salt content. Because of their use historically in making glass, they are also called glassworts. In Spain the saltwort plants were called barilla and were the basis of a large industry in Spain in the 18th century; see barilla. In the early 19th century, plant sources were supplanted by synthetic sodium carbonate produced using the Leblanc process. References Hossein Akhani, Gerald Edwards, Eric H.

This kind of approach is often made through the player's agent. It is expressly forbidden in many professional leagues in their collective bargaining agreements, but is not illegal. In English football A milder form of \\"tapping up\\" involves a manager's letting his admiration for a player at another club become known, perhaps by hinting at his interest while working as a pundit during the broadcast of a game in which the player is taking part, \\"he's the sort of player any manager would be very keen to sign\\", or by lavishing praise in programme notes when the two teams meet. There are also the \\"source close to the manager\\"-type newspaper rumours which in many case originate within the club and are intended to flag an interest while retaining plausible deniability against charges of tapping up. Most ex-players candidly admit that tapping up has gone on in football for decades. Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough later said, \\"we tapped more players than the Severn-Trent water board!\\" Notorious examples of tapping up in the Premier League include Dwight Yorke, Jermain Defoe and Ashley Cole. In these cases, the incidents soured the relationship between the player and his original club. Cole was found guilty and fined ¬£100,000 by the Premier League on 2 June 2005 for a meeting in a hotel in January 2005 between himself, the Chelsea manager Jos√© Mourinho, Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon, and his agent Jonathan Barnett. Chelsea were again at the centre of a controversy in 2009, when the club was found guilty of inducing Ga√´l Kakuta to break his contract with French team RC Lens in 2007. As punishment, they were banned by FIFA from registering new players for two transfer windows. Chelsea appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who subsequently lifted the sanctions on the club and the player after ruling that Kakuta did not have a valid contract with Lens, and therefore could not have breached it. Chelsea's transfer ban was suspended later in the same year, and was lifted in February 2010. Harry Redknapp, manager of Tottenham Hotspur at that time, has said that activity which verges upon 'tapping-up' regularly occurs in deals between Premier League clubs, and Scott Minto, a pundit for Sky Sports, said that the ban was \\"extremely harsh\\" because of the frequency of it. However, there have been other cases where clubs have received transfer window bans for tapping- up; notably, Roma over Philippe Mex√®s, and FC Sion over Essam El-Hadary. The practice of tapping up is portrayed in the 1953 British film The Great Game.

The event featured NASCAR Cup and Truck Series vehicles against local late models and other stock cars. Formula Libre, also known as Formule Libre, is a form of automobile racing allowing a wide variety of types, ages and makes of purpose-built racing cars to compete \\"head to head\\". This can make for some interesting matchups, and provides the opportunity for some compelling driving performances against superior machinery. The name translates to \\"Free Formula\\" ‚Äì in Formula Libre races the only regulations typically govern basics such as safety equipment. In 1932, Louis Chiron won the Nice Grand Prix aboard a Bugatti T51, closely followed just 3.4 seconds behind by Raymond Sommer in an Alfa Romeo Monza with third place going to Ren√© Dreyfus, also in a Bugatti T51. In 1933, the race was won by Tazio Nuvolari in a Maserati 8C, followed by Ren√© Dreyfus in his Bugatti and Guy Moll in an Alfa Romeo Monza. In 1934, the race was again won by an Italian in an Alfa Romeo Tipo B, none other than the best driver of the season, Achille Varzi. The last season to feature a Grand Prix at Nice was in 1935, when the Alfa Romeo Tipo Bs dominated the circuit in the hands of Tazio Nuvolari and Louis Chiron, who placed second, and Ren√© Dreyfus, who took third. Most recently, the British Open Single Seaters (BOSS) Formula has spawned EuroBOSS and USBOSS equivalents, signalling the re-emergence of Formula Libre events. Racing purists have come to embrace Formula Libre as an alternative to the increasing preponderance of spec racing series, and a number of competitors' vehicles are cars orphaned by discontinued spec series. Formula Libre has provided some ambitious young drivers with an alternative to series with higher competitive costs and lower performance. Most recently, the UK's British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) awarded their Rising Star award to 2004 EuroBOSS Champion Scott Mansell . The concept is arguably the oldest in motor racing: *Grand Prix racing adopted Formule Libre briefly, beginning in 1928. *Formula Libre racing is currently very popular in South Africa. *Germany's Interserie runs as a Formula Libre, mixing single-seat formula cars with sports racing prototypes. *The Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course hosted a Formula Libre race from 1958 through 1960 as a prelude to becoming the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix. *USAC held a famous Formula Libre race at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1962. *Formula Libre is a popular class in historic or vintage racing. *Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race in 1959, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports cars by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, normally considered competitive for oval tracks only. *1971's Questor Grand Prix was a well-attended inter- series race between Formula One, Formula 5000, and ChampCar teams, featuring top drivers at California's Ontario Motor Speedway. *The Rothmans 50000 race in 1972 permitted almost any kind of single-seater or sports-racer in a race at Brands Hatch, competing for a ¬£50,000 prize fund (considerably more than most Grands Prix of the day). Most of the grid consisted of Formula One and Formula 5000 cars, with some Formula Two machinery and the odd, more exotic vehicle. *Formula Libre races usually closed the programme at British club meetings in the 1970s, allowing not only cars that didn't suit any of the classes racing that day to run but also giving drivers of formula cars another chance to race.

He was the son of Adelbert Salusbury Cockayne Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow, and his wife Maud Buckle. Early life He was educated at Eton, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, later being commissioned into the Grenadier Guards. He fought in the First World War and left the Army in 1926 with the rank of lieutenant. In 1927 he succeeded his elder brother as 6th Baron Brownlow and to Belton House near Grantham, Lincolnshire. Inter-war years Belton House, the ancestral home of the Cust family He was Mayor of Grantham from 1934-35. Brownlow also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire from 1936 to 1950. During the 1930s Brownlow was a close friend and equerry to the Prince of Wales, and later Lord-in-waiting when he became King Edward VIII. The Prince spent many weekends at Brownlow's country house, Belton House, but it is not known whether or his future wife, Wallis Simpson, ever spent time at Belton. Upon Edward VIII's accession to the throne, Lord Brownlow became heavily involved in the abdication crisis which followed the new King's intention to marry Simpson. Brownlow personally accompanied Simpson on her flight to France to escape the media attention, and encouraged Simpson to renounce the idea of marriage to the King.Belton House, 63 Returning to England, Brownlow attempted to enlist the support of the King's mother Queen Mary, but she refused to receive him.Thornton, 136 Following the abdication, Lord Brownlow attempted to extricate himself from the former King's circle, refusing to attend the Duke of Windsor's marriage ceremony in 1937.

Post war Lacking the Duchess of Windsor's forgiveness following the abdication of Edward VIII was one thing; following the accession of the new monarch, King George VI, Brownlow read without prior warning in the Court Circular, that he had been replaced as the sovereign's lord-in-waiting. Telephoning Buckingham Palace for an explanation, he was given the curt information that his resignation had been accepted ‚Äì but he had never tendered it. It was also made clear to him that the new king and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, had ordered that Brownlow's name was never to appear in the Court Circular again.(Thornton, 137) Personal life Lord Brownlow married three times. He married firstly Katherine, daughter of Brigadier General Sir David Alexander Kinloch, 11th Baronet, in 1927. They had three children.

The cauldron is decorated with figures reminiscent of the style of the Gundestrup cauldron. It has a diameter of and a height of , and is made from of 18 carat gold. History The Chiemsee Cauldron was discovered in 2001 by a local diver at the bottom of Lake Chiemsee, about 200m from the shore near Arlaching, Chieming municipality. It was initially suspected to be some 2,000 years old, judging by its Celtic-style decoration and its similarity to the Gundestrup cauldron. However, when the artifact was passed along to Ludwig Wamser of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection to be analyzed, it was identified as a 20th-century creation, possibly made during the Nazi era. This seemed to be confirmed by a witness; the senior director of the Munich jeweller's company Theodor Heiden stated that the company's goldsmith, Alfred Notz, before his death in the 1960s, had told him about a \\"golden cauldron weighing more than 10 kg, with a figurative ornament and manufactured by means of the paddle and anvil technique,\\" which had been manufactured in Heiden's workshop between 1925 and 1939.R√∂bel, Sven (23 April 2012). \\"The Mystery of the 'Nazi Holy Grail'\\". Der Spiegel. Retrieved on 28 August 2012. The maker of the cauldron is believed to have been Otto Gahr, a Nazi Party member, silversmith and favoured jeweller to the Nazi elite. Gahr crafted the silver \\"death's head\\" rings worn by SS members. In an interview with National Geographic, jeweler Maximillian Heiden opined that Gahr would have been the obvious choice of the Nazi Party for such a project. According to Max Heiden, Otto Gahr, primarily a silversmith, probably sought out Alfred Notz for his expertise in working with gold. Furthermore, Nazi documents dated April 1945 were found in an attic in Germany in 2011. The papers, which appear to be a movement order for 35 items ranging from gold and silver to precious stones, were discovered among items once belonging to Heinrich Himmler. The documents list a \\"gold cauldron/Celtic\\" along with the name \\"Otto Gahr\\" and \\"Munich\\".\\"Nazi Temple of Doom\\". National Geographic Channel. 2012. The cauldron was commissioned by Albert Pietzsch, director of Elektrochemische Werke M√ºnchen. Pietzsch had been in personal contact with Hitler from 1920, and was known to have provided him with generous donations. He became a member of the Nazi party in 1927 and rose to the position of Military Economy Leader (Wehrwirtschaftsf√ºhrer) and president of the Reich Chamber of Commerce (Reichswirtschaftskammer). He survived the war and died in 1957. Because of its association with the Nazi elite, the cauldron was dubbed \\"Hitler's bedpan\\" (Hitlers Nachttopf) by the media. The Bavarian state and the finder agreed to sell the find on the open market and share the proceeds. The cauldron was bought by an investor for EUR 300,000, at the time about twice the market value of the gold.\\"Wegen 'Hitlers Nachttopf' vor Gericht\\" . Tages Anzeiger. 27 October 2010. Retrieved on 28 August 2012. The buyer, a Swiss entrepreneur, tried to attract investors by claiming that the cauldron was a genuine antique, and that it had a market value of between ‚Ç¨250 and ‚Ç¨350 million. Investors from Kazakhstan, taken in by these claims, filed suit against the Swiss businessman in 2006. The cauldron was confiscated by the Z√ºrich authorities in 2007, and a fraud trial began on 27 October 2010. As the trial opened, the defendant claimed to have found a new buyer for the cauldron who was prepared to pay 7 million Swiss francs, which would allow him to satisfy all claims against his firm.

Directed by James W. Horne and Charley Rogers, and it was produced at the Hal Roach Studios, and stars Laurel and Hardy, and Thelma Todd in her final film role. This was also the only appearance of Darla Hood in a full-length feature produced by Hal Roach. Plot A group of gypsy caravans set up on the edge of a wood. They realise they are camped on the estate of Count Arnheim who will not tolerate their presence. The gypsies sing and dance to entertain themselves. Stanley Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the misfit pair of Gypsies in the group. When hen-pecked Oliver is out pickpocketing, fortune-telling or attending his zither lessons, his wife (Mae Busch) has an affair with Devilshoof (Antonio Moreno). A cruel nobleman, Count Arnheim (William P. Carleton), persecutes the Gypsies, who are forced to flee, but Mrs Hardy, in revenge for Devilshoof being lashed by the count's orders, kidnaps his daughter, Arline (Darla Hood), and Mrs. Hardy fools Hardy into thinking she is their daughter since he believes everything she tells him. She soon elopes with Devilshoof, and leaves Oliver and \\"Uncle\\" Stanley holding the toddler. Arline is too young to remember her old life. Twelve years later, the Gypsies return to Arnheim's estate. When grown-up Arline (Jacqueline Wells) accidentally trespasses in Arnheim's garden, she recognises the place and Arnheim's voice, but is arrested by a constable (Jimmy Finlayson) and sentenced to a lashing. Stan and Oliver try to save her, but Stan is too drunk and both are arrested. Just as Arline is stripped in order to be lashed, she is rescued in time by Arnheim, who recognises a medallion she wears and a family birthmark, and both try to rescue Stan and Oliver. It is too late though: Laurel and Hardy had already been worked over in the torture chamber: Hardy emerges stretched to a height of eight feet, while Stan has been crushed to only a few feet tall and the constable just stands yelling and moaning.

The station was to serve the Kingman area, although its city of license was to be Hilltop, and the transmitter was located on a bluff overlooking downtown Kingman. The station was licensed on August 25, 1987. Initial programming is unknown, but Group Seven Communications was recognized for its marketing emphasis toward the Hispanic community. In September 2000, Group Seven Communications sold K36AX to Tri- State Broadcasting. In April 2002, the station moved to a new transmitter location on Getz Peak, increasing its signal coverage. And in the July 2002, the station unveiled new call letters, KKAX-LP, based on the old callsign -- K K36AX.

At the time the colony believed its boundaries extended west all the way to the Mississippi River. In 1776 the Virginia General Assembly abolished Fincastle County, organizing three new counties:Montgomery, Washington, and Kentucky. (In 1792 the latter jurisdiction was admitted as the 15th state, the Commonwealth of Kentucky.)Pendleton (1920), pp. 362-63. Although no county seat was designated by the act creating the county, the colonial governor ordered it to be placed at the \\"Lead Mines\\" of Wythe County. Austinville, Virginia, developed here. Botetourt County may have been named for the English home of Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, a very popular governor of the Colony of Virginia. He died just before the tensions of the impending American Revolution made the job much more difficult. John Murray, Earl of Dunmore and Viscount of Fincastle, succeeded Lord Botetourt. Fincastle County may have been named in his honor, or for his son Lord Fincastle. If so, it was clear why the new rebel Americans changed the name in 1776. At that time, Lord Dunmore was leading the military opposition to the rebels in Virginia. He had already issued Dunmore's Proclamation offering freedom to any slaves of rebels who fled their Virginia masters and joined the British forces; this was much resented by rebel planters and slaveholders. The name is represented on Virginia maps by the town of Fincastle, the county seat of the original Botetourt County.

Analysis This poem is full of cheerful images of life, such as the \\"leaves so green\\", and \\"happy blossom\\". The poem tells the tale of two different birds: a sparrow and a robin. The former is clearly content with its existence, whereas the latter is distraught with it, meaning the second stanza becomes full of negative, depressing images. \\"The Blossom\\" is based on actual experience and situations rather than general symbols such as the sparrow representing the upper class and the robin representing the lower class. The infant in the poem is at the mother's breast but most likely it was a nurse's breast; the sparrow represents the child's happiness while the robin represents desolation as robins traditionally appear during the winter, one could assume that it is upset at having missed the exciting, lively critiques that occur with summer ‚Äì such as blossoms. Blake lived in St. Paul's parish, which in 1782 decided to take care of its poor, especially its poor children. Thus, Blake wrote in Songs of Innocence about how the parish sent foundling children to the country to be cared for by nurses‚Äîfoster mothers. He also observed the parish starting charity day schools for poor children in which the students got better education than their more prosperous peers, the children of tradesmen. Unfortunately, in just a few years the benevolence became tainted with little care or money given to the poor, complaints about poor children being better educated than other children and so schools changed to become harsh with children being sent to work (Gardner 30-33; 54-55). Another possible interpretation is a sexual one, where the poem represents the joy that can be found through innocent sexual love. The sparrow, seeking his cradle \\"swift as an arrow\\", has been interpreted in a phallic sense, and demonstrates the innocence and joy of free love. The \\"happy blossom\\" in this sense is therefore the female sexual organs, which is happy upon seeing the arrival of the sparrow. The \\"sobbing, sobbing\\" robin has been interpreted in several different ways. Either it is the opposite to the sparrow's open love, a creature who has been harmed through love or possibly violated, or it is another creature rejoicing in the joy of sexual love, in which case its sobbing could be orgasmic. Many of his poems, such as \\"The Little Girl Lost\\" and \\"Found\\", \\"The Lilly\\" or \\"The Angel\\", also follow this theme of giving in to desires and sexual love. Gallery Scholars agree that \\"The Blossom\\" is the 11th object in the order of the original printings of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience.

Created by Paul Kupperberg and Joe Staton, he first appears as the hero Tempest in Showcase #94 (August 1977). Joshua Clay appeared in his first live adaptation on the first season of the Doom Patrol television series for DC Universe played by Alimi Ballard. Fictional character biography =Early years= A member of the second Doom Patrol, Joshua Clay is the first DC Comics hero to use the name Tempest. Along with Captain Comet, he is one of the few DC Comics heroes initially identified as a mutant. Joshua Clay was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of five children. His parents struggled to keep their family together in the middle of what was at that time one of the worst slums in the country. At sixteen, Joshua joined a street gang called the Stompers, and eventually, as a result, wound up being given a choice between prison and service in the United States military. Joshua chose the army and was trained as a combat medic and shipped off to Vietnam. Less than a month before the end of his tour, Joshua witnessed the attempted massacre of an entire village of Vietnamese non-combatant s by his sergeant. Horrified, Joshua unconsciously triggered his powers, blasting the noncom, apparently killing the man. The stress of this discovery led Clay to go AWOL and flee the country, eventually returning to the U.S. Clay spent the next ten years living as a fugitive.Secret Origins Annual #1 The sergeant eventually becomes Reactron, a repeated foe of the Doom Patrol. =Hero= Arani Caulder tracks down Joshua Clay and enlists him as a member of the new Doom Patrol.Showcase #94 (August/September 1977) Clay stays active within this incarnation of the Doom Patrol for a year before it disbands due to internal dissent. Swearing off superheroics, Clay uses his underworld connections to secure a new identity for himself as Jonathan Carmichael, M.D. Due to years of private study and his previous military training, he easily passes his New York medical board examination. As Carmichael, using funds borrowed from a local loan shark, he purchases a small Park Avenue medical practice and lives a quiet, respectable life treating rich hypochondriacs until Robotman tracks Clay down. Due to Steele's threat to reveal Clay's true identity to the medical board, he reluctantly returns to superheroics.Doom Patrol (vol. 2) #1 (October 1987) He again retires from active service during the Grant Morrison scripted period to become the team's physician. Joshua Clay is murdered by a temporarily deranged Niles Caulder in Doom Patrol (vol. 2) #55 (May 1992). This is after Joshua discovers the Chief's plan to ravage the world with a genetic weapon in the hopes of ultimately creating an improved society.Review of Doom Patrol (vol. 2) #55 Dorothy Spinner, upon finding his body, allowed the demonic Candlemaker out into the real world on the condition it bring Joshua back to life. It does so, and then immediately kills him again. =Blackest Night= Joshua Clay was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps in Doom Patrol (Vol. 5) #4, and attacks Elasti-Girl. His powers seem to have changed, as he is seen controlling the weather, creating tornados and lightning. =The New 52 = In 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted the DC Universe.

It is bounded by the loop of the Floating Harbour (including Bathurst Basin) to the west, north and east, together with the New Cut of the River Avon to the south. Most of Redcliffe lies within the city ward of Lawrence Hill, although the westernmost section, including the cliffs and hill from which the area takes its name, is in Cabot ward.Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map 155 - Bristol & Bath. . Bristol Temple Meads station is located in Redcliffe. Redcliffe takes its name from the red sandstone cliffs which line the southern side of the Floating Harbour, behind Phoenix Wharf and Redcliffe Wharf. These cliffs are honey- combed with tunnels, known as the Redcliffe Caves, constructed both to extract sand for the local glass making industry and to act as store houses for goods. Part of the last remaining glass kiln in the area is now the Kiln Restaurant of the Ramada Bristol City Hotel in Redcliffe Way. The parish church of St. Mary Redcliffe is one of Bristol's best known churches, with the spire at a height of 292 ft (90m) making it the tallest building in the city. History James Johnson, oil on canvas, c. 1825, showing the incomplete spire of St Mary Redcliffe looming above.alt=People fill a shadowed street lined with shops and houses in a mixture of architectural styles, leading towards a sunlit church tower Redcliffe was originally part of the manor of Bedminster, held by the Earls of Gloucester, divided from Bristol by the river Avon. Relatively deep water alongside the outcrops of red sandstone upon which St Mary Redcliffe sits encouraged the development of wharves. Rivalries existed between residents and merchants of Redcliffe and those of Bristol. The only fixed crossing of the river was Bristol Bridge, although there were numerous ferries. In the 12th century, Robert Fitzroy gave the Knights Templar part of Redcliffe, which then became known as Temple Fee. The Templars were granted the power to hold courts and execute felons. This right passed, along with the fee, to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem after the suppression of the Templars. Early recorded industries in Redcliffe include weaving, fulling and dyeing. It is likely that fulling and dyeing, which could be quite noxious processes, were not welcome within the town walls of Bristol and so were established here, nearby but outside the city walls. In the 13th century Redcliffe and Bristol underwent a rapid expansion, in King Henry III's reign due to a 'major harbour improvement' (Broad Quay or St. Augustines Reach). This involved the construction of a 'Great Ditch' which formed a new course for the River Frome through St Augustine's Marsh. This provided more space for ships to moor and new quays were built. In the same period a stone bridge, Bristol Bridge, was constructed. To achieve this, the river Avon was diverted through Redcliffe, along the line of the 'Portwall' and solid stone foundations laid for the bridge, behind wattle and daub coffer dams. \\"The men of Redcliffe\\" were enjoined to help these projects by Henry III. Cabot Tower.alt=A view looking down towards a tall church spire which rises high above the surrounding trees and large modern buildings, with rows of hillside housing in the distance A hundred years later, in 1373, Redcliffe became part of Bristol to become the city and county of Bristol. The granting of county status was important as it meant that legal disputes no longer had to be taken to courts in Gloucester, or Ilminster in Somerset. In 1782 William Watts converted his house, near St Mary Redcliffe, into the world's first shot tower, in order to make lead shot by his innovative tower process. The Redcliffe Shot Tower remained a well-known feature of Redcliffe until 1968, when it was demolished to make way for road improvements, and shot manufacture transferred to the Cheese Lane Shot Tower on the banks of the Floating Harbour.

Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong responded to the unhappiness that resulted from MICA's handling of the incident. He stated that \\"mrbrown had hit out wildly at the Government and in a very mocking tone\\", and that the government had to respond to such criticisms lest they be taken by the public as true. He also stated that national issues should not be debated in such a fashion (referring to Lee's article). The prime minister maintained that Singapore was an open society.

It branches from the Waterloo to Reading Line at Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey and runs to Windsor in Berkshire.  History  The line from Richmond through to was opened on 22 August 1848 by the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway under the auspices of the London and South Western Railway(L&SWR;) and reached Windsor on 1 December 1849. The line was electrified in 1930 at 660 V DC (since raised to 750 V) on the third rail system by the Southern Railway. In the late 1890s, a 3/4 mile single-track branch line was constructed across Staines Moor to supply fuel to a Metropolitan Water Board pumping station. Use of the line ceased in the 1960s and the track has since been lifted. = Connections to Staines West branch = The L&SWR; opposed connection with the Staines West branch but three separate connections have existed. The earliest was through the sidings of the Staines Linoleum Company and would have required use of turntables or reversals to pass wagons between the lines. In World War II a single track spur was laid from just south of facing up on the Staines to Windsor Line as a diversionary route should cross-London routes be blocked by bombing; this link existed from 23 June 1940 to 16 December 1947 but was little used. The last, laid in 1981 when the Staines West branch was severed by the M25 motorway, was to an oil terminal built in the former goods yard of Staines West station and lasted until 1991.  Services  The service frequency is two trains per hour in each direction every day except early on Sunday mornings when it is one per hour. From Windsor to London Waterloo takes about 55 minutes, some 20 minutes longer than the quickest journeys to London Paddington from the other station at Windsor, Windsor & Eton Central, although according to Network Rail timetables, the journey time to many central London locations is similar from both stations. The Sunday service is roughly the same, but limited services pass through Wraysbury and Sunnymeads without stopping on this day. Services on the line run beyond Staines to London Waterloo, running a fast service which calls at these stations: * Ashford  * Richmond  Vauxhall * London Waterloo =Rolling stock= Services are normally operated by Class 458/5s and Class 707s, although Class 455s are occasionally used too. Trains run with 8 or 10 cars, but sometimes run with 4 or 5 cars. The platforms at Sunnymeads and Datchet are too short for the long trains. At these stations selective door opening is used to prevent passengers alighting from the rearmost coaches. Proposed enhancements  A 2008 proposal was for the AirTrack scheme to provide a new link to Heathrow, including a station near the site of the former Staines High Street railway station.Heathrow Airtrack. Consultation Brochure 2. October 2008, p7. Although Airtrack was dropped by BAA, it has not died altogether as in 2011 Wandsworth Council proposed 'AirTrack Lite' and in September 2013, the Airports Commission wrote to the Department for Transport saying: The Windsor Link Railway also proposes a solution for southern rail access to Heathrow as well as linking to Slough via a tunnel in Windsor.

He was rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem for 45 years, nurturing thousands of students who, together with their students, constitute the bulk of Sephardic Torah leadership today.Reisman, L. M. \\"Rabbi Ezra Attia: Builder of Torah\\" in The Torah Profile: A treasury of biographical sketches (1998). Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, p. 92. Among Attiya's most famous students are Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul, and Rabbi Yitzchak Kaduri. Early life Attiya was born on 31 January 1885 (Tu Bishvat 5645 on the Jewish calendar) in Aleppo, Syria, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. His parents, Yitzchak and Leah, had lost several children in infancy, and before his birth they traveled to the gravesite of the Prophet Ezra to pray that if the child they were expecting was a boy, they would name him Ezra and see that he dedicated himself to a life of Torah.\\"Remembering Harav Ezra Attiya, Rosh Yeshivas Porat Yosef\\". Binah Bunch, 11 May 2009. He had one brother, Eliyahu. His father, a respected Aleppo melamed (teacher),Daykin, R. \\"Harav Ezra Attiya, zt\\"l, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivat Porat Yosef - On his 41st yahrtzeit, 19 Iyar\\". Hamodia Magazine, 19 May 2011, pp. 8-15\\\\. Retrieved 19 September 2011. was a direct descendant of Rabbi Shem Tov Attiya, a disciple of Rabbi Joseph Caro, author of the Shulchan Aruch. When Attiya was 16 years old, his family immigrated to Jerusalem's Old City, to which a large number of rabbis from Aleppo had immigrated.Reisman, p. 93. Soon after, his father died, leaving an impoverished widow and two orphans. While his mother hired herself out for domestic work in the homes of wealthy people, young Ezra decided to devote his life to Torah study. He went to learn, pray, and sleep on a bench in a small beth midrash in the Bukharim neighborhood of the New City called Shoshanim LeDavid, covering vast amounts of the Talmud with commentaries and poskim (halakhic decisors). As money was scarce in his household, he sustained himself with a nightly meal of dry pita seasoned with salt. In his old age, he told his students, \\"When I was young, I studied Torah through hardship. If we were truly fortunate, my mother and I had a whole pita to share. On rare occasions we also had an egg, which we divided in half. But the hunger did not bother me in the least.\\" In 1907, Rabbi Ezra Harari-Raful, another Aleppo immigrant, established Yeshivat Ohel Moed in Jerusalem. Attiya was asked to join its staff along with distinguished Sephardic Rabbis Yosef Yedid HaLevi, head of the Sephardic beit din (rabbinical court) of Jerusalem, Shlomo Laniado, and Avraham Haim Ades. He served as maggid shiur. Marriage and flight In 1909, Attiya married Bolissa Salem, daughter of Rabbi Avraham Salem, a kabbalist. In 1911 their first son was born, but died in infancy. At the beginning of World War I, there was a general mobilization for the Turkish army and all able-bodied men were snatched off the streets. Attiya's brother Eliyahu died of pneumonia in the Turkish army. Two of the leading Sephardic sages of Jerusalem, Rabbi Chaim Shaul Dweck Hakohen and Rabbi Avraham Ades, smuggled Attiya to Egypt using a forged Russian passport, which at that time did not require a photograph. Attiya settled in Cairo. At first he attempted to go into business, but quickly lost most of his money. Then he met Nissim Nachum, a wealthy refugee who knew him from Jerusalem. With Nachum's backing, Attiya opened a yeshiva named Ahavah VeAchvah in the basement of the Cairo rabbinate. Under his direction, the yeshiva grew to 100 students, attracting many from secular backgrounds. Attiya also gave classes to working men, and was a dayan on the Cairo beit din.Reisman, p. 95. After World War I ended his wife joined him. They and their two children returned to Jerusalem in 1922. Rosh yeshiva In Jerusalem, Attiya returned to his teaching position at Ohel Mo'ed Yeshiva. He also studied privately with Rabbi Chaim Shaul Dweck and Rabbi Solomon Eliezer Alfandari. When Porat Yosef Yeshiva opened in 1923, Ohel Moed was merged with the new yeshiva and Attiya was appointed as the mashgiach ruchani.Reisman, p. 96. Following the sudden death of the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Shlomo Laniado, in 1925, Attiya was named his successor. He served as rosh yeshiva for 45 years. =Leadership under fire= The pre-1948 facade of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem. His tenure as rosh yeshiva was marked by political upheaval. When the 1929 Arab riots cut off access to the yeshiva building in the Old City, Attiya moved classes to several synagogues in the New City and appointed advanced students to teach them, while he personally supervised every location. This situation continued for eight years. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the yeshiva again evacuated to synagogues in the Katamon, Geula and Bucharim neighborhoods. This time, however, the main yeshiva building in the Old City was burned to the ground by Jordanian troops, and thousands of Attiya's unpublished writings were burned along with it. He refused to rewrite them, feeling that they were not meant for publication. Instead, his students would be his lifetime achievement.Reisman, pp. 101-102. In the mid-1950s, Porat Yosef Yeshiva and the Gerrer community jointly purchased a plot of land in the Geula neighborhood, where the yeshiva and the Ger beis medrash were built side by side. The original yeshiva campus in the Old City was rebuilt and reopened in the 1970s. =Accomplishments= Rabbis of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in 1952. Left to right: Rabbis Yaakov Ades, Ben Zion Abba Shaul, Ezra Attiya, Mansour ben Shimon. One of Attiya's greatest accomplishments was changing the way that yeshiva education was viewed in the Sephardic world. Until that time, full-time Torah learning past the age of bar mitzvah was reserved for gifted students from Sephardic homes; most Sephardic boys went to work to help support their families. Attiya did everything he could to enable boys to continue learning into their teens, many times offering to underwrite the costs of their education. In one case, a poor boy from Iraq applied for admission to the yeshiva but could not provide the necessary tuition. Attiya went to Rabbi Ben Zion Chazan, the yeshiva's founder and secretary, and offered to reduce his own salary to accommodate the boy. Rabbi Chazan then offered to reduce his own salary as well. The boy went on to become a respected talmid chacham.Reisman, p. 98. Attiya was similarly instrumental in keeping the young Ovadia Yosef in the Torah world. At one point, the promising young scholar suddenly stopped coming to yeshiva for several days. Attiya paid a visit to his home and was shocked by the poverty he saw there. Ovadia's father explained that he owned a small grocery store and needed his son to work for him. Attiya's efforts to convince the father of the importance of Torah learning fell on deaf ears. The next morning, when the father entered his store, he found Attiya standing there wearing a work apron. The rosh yeshiva explained that he had come to the store early that morning when Ovadia was opening up. He had told the boy that he had found a substitute worker who would work without pay, and sent him back to yeshiva. \\"You said that you needed someone to help and could not afford to pay. I am that someone. Your son's learning is more important than my time!\\" The father finally conceded and allowed his son to continue learning. Attiya was personally involved with every student in his yeshiva. He tested the younger boys every two to three months, gave a daily shiur to the older boys, taught a nightly shiur to the married kollel students, and gave a weekly musar (ethics) lecture ‚Äî often lasting up to two hours ‚Äî to the entire yeshiva.Reisman, p. 97. He also developed a unique Sephardic approach to Torah and musar. He always carried a copy of the musar classic Chovot ha-Levavot (\\"Duties of the Heart\\") on his person, and strongly advised his students to do the same. He instructed every class in the yeshiva to begin each day with a short musar lesson.Reisman. He was greatly respected by such Torah leaders as Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank and the Chazon Ish. After visiting with him, the Chazon Ish expressed the opinion, \\"The rosh yeshivah possesses the power of reasoning like one of the Rishonim\\". He had an encyclopedic knowledge of all areas of Torah. One of his leading students, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, testified at Attiya's funeral that his teacher knew the entire Choshen Mishpat (the section of the Shulchan Aruch dealing with monetary laws) by heart. Attiya also served as a dayan (rabbinical judge) on the Sephardic beit din of Jerusalem. His opinion was sought and valued by rabbinical leaders and laymen alike. Attiya fulfilled his goal of training Sephardic Torah scholars who could build Sephardic communities at large. During his tenure, he trained thousands of students, including many of the future leaders of Sephardic Jewry in Israel, the United States, Europe, South Africa and South America. These students included: Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, future Sephardic Chief Rabbis of Israel; Rabbi Yitzchak Kaduri, renowned kabbalist; Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, who succeeded him as rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef; Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul; Rabbi Baruch Ben Haim, who became a leader of the Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn, New York; Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Haim, Rabbi of the Mashadi community in Great Neck, NY; and Rabbi Zion Levy, future Chief Rabbi of Panama. Final years Advancing age and weakness forced Attiya to give up much of his responsibilities at the yeshiva. However, he continued to make himself available for advice and consultation with anyone who needed him. In this way, he continued to nurture the Sephardic Torah leaders he had trained and dispatched to communities around the world. In 1969, he became seriously ill and drifted in and out of a coma for an entire year. He died in Jerusalem on the morning of 25 May 1970 (19 Iyar 5730) and was buried on Har HaMenuchot. He was succeeded as rosh yeshiva by Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, who had learned under him since the age of 14.Mizrahi, Moshe. \\"Protecting the Trust: Harav Yehuda Tzadka, zt\\"l - His vision, his sacrifices and the legacy he left for us, twenty years after his petirah\\".

The ED&BC; was preceded by a promotional railway known as the Athabaska Railway, which was floated in the 1910s during the heady days of Canadian railway expansion. On paper it was to strike out from Edmonton northwestward to Peace River Country, over Pine Pass and eventually reach Prince George, British Columbia. There were also amorphous dreams of reaching the Yukon. Together with the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, the owners had dreams of becoming a much larger system, possibly through partnership. The company was rechartered in 1911 under the ownership of J.D. McArthur with the name Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway. Chided as the \\"Exceedingly Dangerous and Badly Constructed Railway\\", it took a few years to formulate. Fires, flood, strikes and other mishaps plagued the line in its early years. Construction of the ED&BC; started in 1912 from Edmonton heading toward Westlock, reaching High Prairie in 1914, and Spirit River in 1915. Deciding not to proceed to Dunvegan, a branch was built south from Rycroft to Grande Prairie in 1916. In 1924 the line was extended to Wembley and it reached Hythe in 1928. Costs, financial depression, overbuilding by many companies in the west and World War I all curtailed railway development. As a result, the Government of Alberta bought the railway, and leased it to the Canadian Pacific Railway for several years. Northern Alberta Railway In 1929, the ED&BC; became part of the Northern Alberta Railway (NAR), a Crown corporation of the Government of Alberta. The government extended the NAR's former ED&BC; line west from Hythe to a new western terminus at Dawson Creek, British Columbia, however the entire NAR stagnated throughout the 1930s and the Great Depression. A traffic boom returned to northern Alberta with World War II and the construction of the Alaska Highway and the oil industry in the Northwest Territories. The ED&BC; was one of three lines in Northern Alberta, all merging into the NAR; the other two being the Central Canada Railway and the Alberta Waterways Railway. ED&BC; locomotive No. 73 and several cars survive at the Alberta Railway Museum in Edmonton. Scientific wunderkind Dr. Karl Clark, of the University of Alberta, ran out of room in the university basements, and human muscle to move the raw oilsand material he was researching at the University of Alberta, and thus he moved his washing machine, steam plant and other apparatus, to the ED&BC; shop facilities in Edmonton. He continued to perfect his oil separation process which became the basis for modern-day Alberta's oilsands industry, demonstrated by Syncrude's vast operation in Fort McMurray.

Overview Mainly popular in the 1960s and early 1970s, Carter's craftsmanship can be heard at work with: * Carter-Lewis and the Southerners. * The Ivy League - \\"Funny How Love Can Be\\", \\"That's Why I'm Crying\\", \\"Tossing and Turning\\" * Herman's Hermits - \\"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\\" * Brenda Lee - \\"Is It True?\\" * The Music Explosion - \\"Little Bit O' Soul\\" * Peter and Gordon - \\"Sunday for Tea\\" * The Flower Pot Men - \\"Let's Go to San Francisco\\" * The First Class - \\"Beach Baby\\" * Sacha Distel - \\"Vite, Cherie, Vite\\" (French version of \\"Beach Baby\\") * Mary Hopkin - \\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\\" * Kincade - \\"Dreams Are Ten A Penny\\" Biography Carter met his future songwriting partner Ken Hawker at school in Birmingham. They formed a skiffle band in the 1950s called LVI. It was then they began writing songs together: \\"We began to write real Buddy Holly take- offs. Which was good, it got us excited about songwriting.\\" In 1960 the duo went to London and presented themselves under their songwriting pseudonyms John Carter and Ken Lewis. Terry Kennedy became their manager and convinced them to start their own band as an outlet for their songs. In 1961 the first single by Carter-Lewis and the Southerners was released, \\"Back on the Scene\\". But the band never broke through and their main claim to fame remains a brief stint that Jimmy Page did as their lead guitarist. In 1964 they met Perry Ford, who worked as an engineer in a small recording studio in Denmark Street, London. They noticed their voices blended well and started recording demos together, resulting in a single on Pye Records, \\"What More Do You Want\\" as the Ivy League. Their luck changed when Herman's Hermits recorded \\"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\\" and took it to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. In the UK it was a smaller hit for Goldie and the Gingerbreads. They then provided backing vocals for \\"I Can't Explain\\", by the Who. In 1965 and 1966, The Ivy League scored four UK chart hits, including \\"Tossing and Turning\\", which reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart and \\"Funny How Love Can Be\\" top 10 hit. By early 1966 Carter decided he had had enough of touring and was replaced by Tony Burrows from The Kestrels. That year he married Gill Shakespeare who would later write lyrics for some of his songs. Carter concentrated on songwriting, providing hits for Peter and Gordon and Brenda Lee. He found a new songwriting partner in Geoff Stephens, resulting in \\"My World Fell Down\\", recorded by The Ivy League, later to be covered by Gary Usher's Sagittarius. Carter sang lead on the New Vaudeville Band's hit single \\"Winchester Cathedral\\", a traditional pop pastiche that became a U.S. chart- topper. He also released a single, recorded with Mickey Keen and Robin Shaw, as The Ministry of Sound. Early in 1967, Ken Lewis quit the Ivy League and started writing and recording again with Carter. One of the first results was \\"Let's Go to San Francisco\\", released as the Flower Pot Men. As was the case with \\"Winchester Cathedral\\", when the recording, made by session musicians, became a hit, a band had to be assembled for live appearances. In late 1967, Carter and Lewis formed Sunny Records as their production company. Starting early 1968 Carter's output became more and more confusing. Songs intended for the Flowerpot Men were released as Friends, Haystack and Dawn Chorus, only to be re-released in this century as the Flowerpot Men. The 'touring' Flower Pot Men were forced by Deram Records to record songs by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook. As Mark Frumento wrote in the liner notes of the retrospective Flowerpot Men album Listen To the Flowers Grow (compiled by Carter): \\"At this point Deram decided that the Flower Pot Men name was no longer commercial and the next single, \\"Piccolo Man\\" was released as 'Friends'.... The final Flowerpot Men single was released in 1969, but this time the writing team Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway were behind the production\\". After one abortive attempt the remains of the Flowerpot Men changed their name to White Plains. The 1970s started with a disappointment when Mary Hopkin became runner-up in the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\\", which Carter had written with Stephens. In the following years Carter released records under many names: Stamford Bridge (number 47 with \\"Chelsea\\"), Scarecrow and Stormy Petrel. He also released a single as the Ohio Express, an American bubblegum group. A hit came in 1974 with \\"Beach Baby\\" - Carter/Shakespeare by First Class in 1974. The record also charted in Europe, Australia and South Africa. Another song written by Carter and his wife Gill Shakespeare was \\"Dreams Are Ten A Penny\\" by Kincade which was successful on in Europe. After two First Class albums, Carter started concentrating on writing advertising jingles. Among his work are commercials for Vauxhall Motors, British Caledonian and, for Rowntree's, the 1974 children's' song \\"Please Yourself\\" which introduced a band of four toy characters based on the four different types of Tots sweets: Jerry Joe, vocals (Jelly); Tom, guitar (Tiger); Tim, drums (Teddy); Candy- Doll, keyboards (Candy). His last shot at a hit single was in 1977 as Starbreaker with \\"Sound of Summer\\", which itself began life as music in a commercial for Butlin's. In more recent times, Carter has been managing the marketing of his back catalogue through Sunny Records, releasing many songs that were never released at the time of recording. These includes Stamford Bridge's albums Come Up And See Us Sometime and The First Day Of Your Life (1997). Carter worked with Micky Keen and Robin Shaw and as a result of this collaboration they released two albums, Men From The Ministry and Midsummer Nights Dreaming (2005). In late 2005, Carter released the compilation album; John Carter - A Rose by any Other Name (2005). In the mid-eighties, John served on the Council of the British Academy of Composers and songwriters and the council as a writer-member of the Performing Right Society. He currently runs with Gill, his own publishing company and record production company, which concentrates on compiling and promoting his enormous back-catalogue of songs and records. In 2012 Carter teamed up with a Brazilian songwriter, Salomao Hamzem who is a musician, songwriter and producer. As writers, they wanted to try something a bit different so hit on the idea of writing songs together in English and Portuguese. When Carter and Hamzem were thinking about names for the band, they came up with the idea of combining the first part Salomao's surname of Hamzem and the last part of Carter making 'Hamzter'. That's why the hamster has become their mascot. Their first album A Friend in Need (2016) was a result of this collaboration, followed by Coming Home (2017) and their third album, Time Will Tell (2018). In 2019, they are planning to release their next album.

The poem in Songs of Innocence tells the tale of a nurse who, we are to assume, is looking over some children playing in a field. When she tries to call them in, they protest, claiming that it is still light and therefore there is still time to play. The poem fits in with the theme of innocence, as it makes no mention of the negative aspects of playing outside; the children are oblivious of the dangers of playing outside late at night that would be considered in a modern society. The language uses various images associated with children's playing and imagination. The nurse is of a jovial and warm-hearted nature, as she allows the children to continue with their games, with no thought for the wider consequences. In his commentary, Sir Geoffrey Keynes wrote that one critic said that \\"few besides Blake could have written such a successful poem on the delight of being allowed to play a little longer until dusk\\".William Blake: Songs of Innocence and of Experience, with Introduction and Commentary by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, 1967/87, Oxford University Press, , p. 140. The poem in Songs of Experience portrays the nurse in a different light: she is bitter, and fears the consequences of her actions. For critical interpretations of the poems, see here.

She was born in Eccles, East Bank Demerara, Guyana, in 1954. She wrote poetry from her early school days at The Bishops' High School, Georgetown. She did her first degree at the University of Guyana and received her B.A. in philosophy at Columbia University, New York, and then began a doctoral programme in Philosophy at the University of Chicago. Das became very ill and was never able to complete the programme.  Background  She was a dancer, actress, teacher and beauty queen (Ms. Dewali, 1971)Fraser, O. A. (2003, Jun 14). A people's poet: Guyana's mahadai das; 1954-2003.Michigan Citizen , served as a volunteer member of the Guyana National Service around 1976 and was part of the Messenger Group promoting ‚ÄòCoolie‚Äô art forms at a time when Indo-Guyanese culture was virtually excluded from national life. She was one of the first Indo-Caribbean women to be published.http://www.mcreview.com/members_login/2007/fall/narrowcitizenship.pdf Her poetry explicitly relates to ethnic identity, something which contrasts her with other female Indo Caribbean poets. Another theme in her writing is the working conditions in the Caribbean islands. Das's A Leaf in His Ear was included in an article on \\"10 Female Caribbean Authors You Should Know\\". One of Das's last published work of poetry was named \\"bones\\" and was published in 1988 by the Peepal Press of London. Guyana faced big social and political problems dealing with corrupt and unfair laws and government. Das tried to find ways to solve these issues and was a part of the Working People's Alliance whose goal, like Das's, was to find resolutions to the number of problems Guyana faced on a daily basis regarding politics and social issues.  Death  Das died April 3, 2003 in Barbados, from an illness relating to cardiac arrest which was suffered 10 days before her death.  Themes  There are a few reoccurring themes in many of Das's writings including the very poor and unfair working conditions that many Caribbean people sadly have to endure for their entire life. In addition to poor working conditions, another reoccurring themes in Das's writings have to do with is ethnic identity and people finding who they really are and coming to terms with who they are despite all the negativity coming from outside Europeans. These themes, although reoccurring in Das's many writings and poems, also tend to be the theme of a majority of Caribbean authors. * Bones (Peepal Tree Press Ltd., 1988) * A Leaf in His Ear: Selected Poems (Peepal Tree Press Ltd., 2010) Several of her poems were included in The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry (Heinemann, 1992).

It is down the line from , on the Staines to Windsor & Eton Line. The station has two side platforms linked by a pedestrian footbridge, and the principal station buildings are to be found on the London bound platform. The station has a central location within Datchet village, and two level crossings cross the line immediately to the west of the station. The presence of these crossings, which carry both road routes from the village to the nearby town of Windsor, can cause traffic delays in the village. History The Windsor, Staines & South Western railway was authorised to build a railway line to Windsor in 1847, however Datchet was the temporary terminus after the line was opened from Richmond on 22 August 1848. The finally completed route over the River Thames was opened on 1 December 1849. The original station had goods facilities on both up and down sides but these were eventually closed by 17 January 1965. This area is now a car park on the down side and industrial units on the up side. The large goods shed next to the station master's house was also demolished in the early 1990s. The up side station building was burnt down in a fire in September 1986 but was rebuilt in a more basic style coupled with flats above it. The station masters house survived and is the only surviving structure left. The down side wooden building has also been lost. Datchet had a manual signal box which also worked the manual level crossing gates, this and Mays crossing box closed in December 1974 when control has taken over by Feltham power box, this led to the replacement of the manual barriers with the lifting ones we have today. The ticket office is now open Monday-Friday between 06:15 and 13:05 & Saturday from 07:55 to 14:45 whereas previously it was weekdays peak hours only. In recent years the platforms have been raised and more modern lighting erected. The most recent development has been the relaying of both down & up lines through the station replacing some very worn permanent way. Services A South Western Railway on a London- bound service The station is served by the stopping service between Windsor & Eton Riverside and London Waterloo, operated by South Western Railway. There are generally two trains per hour, taking some 4 minutes to reach Windsor & Eton Riverside, and just under an hour to reach Waterloo.

It was built to carry slate from several slate quarries across the Nantlle Valley to the harbour at Caernarfon for export by sea. The line provided a passenger service between Caernarfon and Talysarn from 1856 to 1865. It was the first public railway to be operated in North Wales. A tramway linking the Nantlle slate quarries to Caernarfon was proposed in the 1810s. The Nantlle Railway was authorised by an Act of Parliament in May 1825, and the company began construction of the railway. The line was designed and constructed by George Stephenson and his son, Robert. The line opened in 1828 and was operated using horses. During the 1860s and 1870s, a portion of the line was replaced by the standard gauge branch of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) which acquired the line in the late 1860s. The Nantlle Railway was closed in 1963 by British Railways (BR), when it was the last line to be operated by BR using horse traction. Much of the route has been overlaid with roads or obliterated by other developments, but several railway structures remain. Two miles of the northern section of the original Nantlle Railway trackbed, between and the Coed Helen Lane tunnel, are part of the reopened Welsh Highland Railway, although much is off line as was the Carnarvonshire Railway route on which the restored WHR was constructed. History =Background= The first proposals for a railway in the Nantlle Valley were made during 1813. Slate quarries had developed to north and west of Nantlle, and the slate was transported to wharves at Caernarfon by pack horse. A more efficient system was required to enable the quarries to compete with Dinorwic and Penrhyn. A route for the line was surveyed, running westwards from tramways linked to the quarries, towards Talysarn and Penygroes. The line then turned northwards, passing through Groeslon, Llanwnda, Dinas and Bontnewydd. The line was also carried copper from the mine at Drws-y-coed, to the east of Nantlle. The Act of Parliament for the Nantlle Railway was passed on 20 May 1825. The Nantlle Railway Company was incorporated in June 1825 to construct and operate the railway, and in August 1825 it advertised for a sub-contractor to build the line. The company raised a working capital of ¬£20,000 by issuing shares at ¬£100 each. Most of the shareholders were owners of the quarries served by the line. The chief engineer was the railway pioneer George Stephenson, and construction was overseen by his son Robert, who was assisted by John Gillespie. The line was run as a toll road with customers charged a fee for their goods to be hauled to their destination. =Construction= On 21 March 1827, a second Act was passed, authorising an additional ¬£70,000 of shares to finance construction. The act mortgaged the railway's infrastructure, and restricted the fees it could charge until all debts were paid. On 23 May 1828, in response to slower than expected progress, a third Act was passed extending by five years the time available for construction. Robert Williams of Bangor was appointed the resident engineer and William Owen of Gwaenfynydd, Anglesey was contracted to construct the railway. The railway required significant civil engineering work, including a long embankment and culvert to the west of Bontnewydd, two tunnels, and a bridge. The short Coed Helen Tunnel carried the line underneath a road on a gentle gradient, rising from north to south. Its walls and roof were built of coursed blocks up to long. The line crossed under the driveway of Plas Dinas house in the long Plas Dinas Tunnel. It was wide and had a semi- circular arched roof, high, made of three rings of brick, supported on walls of stone rubble. The Plas Dinas Tunnel is approached by a pair of deep cuttings. The Afon Gwyrfai Bridge is long with a single arch that carried the railway over the Afon Gwyrfai to the west of Bontnewydd. It is wide at its base, narrowing towards the crown and above water level. It is built from rusticated stone blocks. In September 1999, the Afon Gwyrfai Bridge was listed as a Grade II structure. The track was laid with lightweight wrought iron fish-bellied rails to a, significantly wider than the gauge found on contemporary quarry railways, and narrower than the which became the standard gauge. The Nantlle Railway was single track throughout, with 22 passing loops but without any signals. Trains ran from one passing place to the next using line of sight to ensure safe working. This led to disputes when trains met between passing loops. Trains typically consisted of four or five wagons, pulled by a single horse travelling at walking pace of around . =Ownership changes and later use= The Nantlle Railway was acquired by the Carnarvonshire Railway. On 25/7/67, the line from Pant on the southern edge of Caernarfon at Coed Helen, to Tyddyn Bengam, north of Penygroes, was replaced by a single-track standard-gauge line. The Carnarvonshire Railway ran trains from to . In July 1870, the Carnarvonshire Railway and the remaining narrow- gauge section of the Nantlle Railway was acquired by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). This left gauge sections at the north and south ends of the line, with of standard gauge in the middle. Slates were loaded onto narrow gauge wagons near the quarries and drawn by horses to Tyddyn Bengam, where the narrow gauge wagons and their contents were loaded onto standard- gauge transporter wagons, three at a time. North of Pant, the narrow gauge wagons were unloaded onto the narrow-gauge tracks and hauled by horses along the last to the quayside at Caernarfon Harbour. This process was slow, costly. In 1870, the LNWR extended the standard gauge line north from Pant to Caernarfon Station where it met a branch built from Bangor in 1852. In December 1871, the standard gauge tracks were extended onto the quayside, removing the need for transhipment and the isolated Caernarfon section of the Nantlle was abandoned. That same year, the LNWR built a short branch from to a new station at Talysarn, named . This was built partly on a new alignment and partly over the narrow gauge tracks. Extensive transshipment yards were laid out at 'Nantlle' where slate arriving on the narrow-gauge was loaded into standard-gauge wagons. The remaining approximately of gauge horse-drawn tramway linked Nantlle with the quarries to the west and north. It was operated by the LNWR until 1923 when it was absorbed into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). From 1948, the line was owned and operated by British Railways (BR). In its final years, the line attracted enthusiasts' railtours. When the Ffestiniog Railway celebrated its Centenary of Steam on 22 May 1963, a Nantlle horse and handler hauled a demonstration train at Porthmadog. The railway was closed in 1963, when the branch to which it was connected was shut. The last recorded use of horses by BR was on the Nantlle railway. Dyffryn Nantlle in 1959 Rolling stock The narrow gauge line was a wagonway constructed to a gauge of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) and equipped with four wheeled wagons fitted with double-flanged wheels, which were loose on fixed axles. For many of their later years many wagons had extended axles which protruded beyond the wheels. Some wagons had eyes bolted to the tops of their sides to enable them to be lifted bodily by the Blondins used in some of the quarries. The wagons were owned by the tramway, rather than the quarries and the many that survived into BR ownership had narrow steel plate bodies, which were mounted between the wheels and bolted to the axles. Their shape and structure appears to have changed little from the railway's earliest years. thumb thumb Modern times Two miles of the northern section of the original Nantlle Railway trackbed, between and the Afon Seiont, now is part of the reopened Welsh Highland Railway. Much of the route has been built over, but in 2016 the remains of three significant Nantlle Railway structures could still be found: * a tunnel at Coed Helen, just visible from passing Welsh Highland Railway trains * a bridge near * a tunnel at Plas Dinas See also *Welsh Highland Railway *British industrial narrow gauge railways  References  =Sources=   * * Further reading   External links        Category:Welsh Highland Railway Category:Early Welsh railway companies Category:Slate industry in Wales Category:Industrial railways in Wales Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Wales Category:Railway companies established in 1825 Category:Railway lines opened in 1828 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1865 Category:Horse-drawn railways Category:British companies established in 1825 Category:1925 establishments in Wales Category:Railway inclines in Wales ","title":"Nantlle Railway"},{"id":"5627131","text":"Tom≈üani may refer to several places in Romania: * Tom≈üani, a commune in Prahova County * Tom≈üani, a commune in V√¢lcea County * Tom≈üani, a village in Coste»ôtii din Vale Commune, D√¢mbovi≈£a County ","title":"Tom»ôani"},{"id":"5627135","text":"Rue de M√©nilmontant, the main street of M√©nilmontant, with central Paris and the Centre Georges Pompidou in the distance M√©nilmontant () is a neighbourhood of Paris, situated in the city's 20th arrondissement.

History Originally a hamlet within the independent commune (municipality) of Belleville, M√©nilmontant was, like other suburban communes surrounding the French capital, absorbed into the city of Paris in 1860. The name is said to derive from Mesnil Mautemps, meaning \\"bad weather house\\". By the 16th century mautemps had been corrupted into montant (meaning \\"climbing\\"), probably owing to its situation on a hill overlooking Paris. In 1832, the area also served as the location of a retreat, established by the Saint-Simonian theorist Enfantin and forty followers. Before its 1860 absorption into Paris, M√©nilmontant lay beyond the capital's tax border (octroi), so that wine was cheaper there, leading to the development of numerous drinking establishments, known as guinguettes, in the 18th century. It has long been a predominantly working-class neighborhood, and in the early 1830s became notorious for the commune established there by the Saint- Simonians before being banned by the authorities. Transport M√©nilmontant is served by the M√©nilmontant station of the M√©tro.

The network has several bureaus, 142 affiliated stations all over Brazil. Jovem Pan broadcasts through satellite digital quality sound reaching more than 25 million listeners, and throughout the world by the Internet, thus being one of the biggest radios in the world. Therefore, Jovem Pan is one of the most important media in the communication industry. Also, Jovem Pan has a great influence on the types of music that jovem or young people listen to. The radio station is well known for bringing foreign music, mainly American music, to the attention of young people in Brazil. 1940s Paulo Machado de Carvalho left the station in 1942, going to R√°dio Record. The general direction was then assumed by Antonio Augusto Amaral de Carvalho (Tuta), current director president of REDE JOVEM PAN SAT, that at that time was only 21 years old. In that same year, Panamericana left S√£o Bento Street and went to the 275 Riachuelo Street. 1950s Years later, in 1953, Tuta left the broadcasting station to dedicate himself to TV Record, channel 7 of S√£o Paulo, who were beginning transmissions. In 1954, Panamericana moved again to 713 Avenida Miruna, in the neighborhood of the Airport, where the Group of United Broadcasting stations resided. 1960s In 1964, still linked to TV Record, Antonio Augusto Amaral de Carvalho assumed the direction of the broadcasting station again. The name Jovem Pan appeared in 1965, given by Paulo Machado de Carvalho. The great transformation of Panamericana began in 1966, under the direction of Tuta. Already with the name of Jovem Pan, to radio it began several programs with idols of the Brazilian popular music that, at that time, they made great success in TV Record. The journalistic programs were created in 1970, 71 and 72, period in that they appeared the Team Seven and Thirty, the Newspaper National Integration and, finally, the Newspaper of the Morning, that is a reference in the journalism of radio in every country until today. 1970s In 1973, Antonio Augusto Amaral de Carvalho left TV Record to dedicate himself exclusively to R√°dio Jovem Pan. In that same year, he acquired the actions of the siblings' broadcasting station Paulo Machado of Carvalho Filho and Alfredo de Carvalho, becoming its only proprietor. In 1976, Jovem Pan left the avenue Miruna and is now situated at 807 Avenida Paulista. In the same year, Jovem Pan 2 FM was inaugurated, located in the same place.

The serial's cast features John King, Jean Rogers, Noah Beery, Jr. and Jackie Morrow, with Lon Chaney, Jr. in a supporting role. Premise A mysterious villain who calls himself the Dragon is attempting to prevent International Airways from beginning service in Mongolia, in order to protect the secret of the mountain of jade for himself. The serial features a dungeon in the nearby monastery, the kidnapping of an archeologist who stumbles onto the secret, his daughter's attempts to rescue him with Ace's help, a death ray the Dragon uses on the airline pilots, a radio system by which The Dragon communicates with his henchmen via the rotation of Buddhist prayer wheels (each transmission concluding \\"The Dragon commands!\\"), and a squadron of his own fighter planes.

Production Ace Drummond was based on a comic strip by Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Ace Drummond gained good publicity following a set visit by Amelia Earhart. The famous aviator had driven out to the San Fernando Valley, after hearing that the serial was being shot there on location, where she watched the filming of the chapter two cliffhanger. In the traditional foreword at the beginning of each chapter, Ace Drummond used comic strips to summarise the story so far. This worked well, and Universal who had been trying to get away from using written text in its forewords, used \\"similar gimmicks\\" in their succeeding serials. =Music= Ace also regularly performs his theme song, \\"Give Me a Ship and a Song\\".

He was made the first Jagadguru (head) of the DvƒÅraka Pƒ´·π≠ha·πÉ, the monastery founded by Adi Shankara in Dwaraka. Hastamalaka founded a matha by name Idayil Matham in Thrissur, Kerala. Meeting Adi Shankara The MƒÅdhavƒ´ya ≈öa·πÉkaravijayam states that when Adi Shankara was at Kollur, he accepted invitations by brƒÅhma≈Üas to have Bhik≈üa (alms or food) at their houses. On such an occasion he visited a village called ≈örƒ´ Bali (present day Shivalli), where every house was said to emit the holy smell of the smoke of Agnihotra sacrifice, to accept Bhik≈üa. That place was inhabited by about two thousand brƒÅhma≈Üas who were learned in the Vedas and performed the Yajnas prescribed in the Vedas. There was also a temple dedicated to Shiva and Parvati. In that village there lived a brƒÅhma≈Üa, PrabhƒÅkara, who was noted for his learning. He had a son who though appearing quite handsome, behaved rather like an idiot. Though upanayanam was performed for him, he did not take to studying the Vedas, instead preferred to sit around doing nothing. Hearing about Adi Shankara's visit, PrabhƒÅkara approached the Acharya (teacher) with a load of fruit and prostrated before him. He also made his son prostrate before him. PrabhƒÅkara explained to Adi Shankara that his son behaved rather like an idiot and sat idly throughout the day. Then, Adi Shankara addressed that young boy and asked him who he was. The boy replied in 12 verses containing the gist of the Advaita philosophy.Hastamalaka Stotra Thus Adi Shankara was immensely impressed with him and accepted him as his disciple. He was named HastƒÅmalaka (one with the amalaka fruit in his hand) since the knowledge of the Self was natural to him like an Amalaka fruit in one's hand. Adi Shankara took the boy into his party and started towards his next destination.

It played a key role in the nation's road to independence during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. History During the Second World War, Britain occupied Italian Somaliland and militarily administered the territory from 1941 to 1950. Faced with growing Italian political pressure inimical to continued British tenure and Somali aspirations for independence, the Somalis and the British came to see each other as allies. The first modern Somali political party, the Somali Youth Club (SYC), was subsequently established in Mogadishu in 1943.I. M. Lewis, A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa, (LIT Verlag M√ºnster: 1999), p.304. At its foundation in 1943, the party had thirteen founding members. Four were Darod (the most important being Yasin Haji Osman Sharmarke); three were Rahanweyn; three Reer Hamar; and one Isaaq. https://books.google.ca/books?id=yoMBQCr4LysC&pg;=PA304&dq;=somali+youth+league+daarood&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjR0InyhrLsAhXUN30KHdrPCvgQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q;=somali%20youth%20league%20daarood&f;=false. The Harari would become members in 1946 when SYL opened an office in Harar. SYL supported Greater Somalia with Harar being the capital and a combined Harari-Somali representatives were commissioned to reveal this proposal to the U.N office in Mogadishu. Somali Youth League members were significantly influenced by the earlier religious rebellion at the turn of the century of various religious figures such as Uways al-Barawi, Sheikh Hassan Barsane and Mohammed Abdullah Hassan. To empower the new party, the better educated police and civil servants were permitted to join it. By 1948, following an official visit to the territory by the Four Power Commission, the SYC was a well- structured political unit, Abdullahi Issa was elected as its Secretary General and renamed itself as the Somali Youth League (SYL) and began to open offices not only in Italian and British Somaliland, but also in the Ogaden and in the Northern Frontier District (NFD). The SYL's stated objectives were to unify all Somali territories, including the NFD and the Ogaden; to create opportunities for universal modern education; to develop the Somali language by a standard national orthography; to safeguard Somali interests; and to oppose the restoration of Italian rule. SYL policy banned clannishness so that the thirteen founding members, although representing four of Somalia's five major clans, refused to disclose their clan affiliations. Although the SYL enjoyed considerable popular support from northerners, the principal parties in British Somaliland were the Somali National League (SNL) and National United Front (NUF), mainly associated with the Isaaq clan, and the United Somali Party (USP), which had the support of the Dir (Gadabuursi) and Darod (Dulbahante and Warsangali) clans. In 1945, the Potsdam conference was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy.Federal Research Division, Somalia: A Country Study, (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p.38 The United Nations opted instead in November 1949 to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition‚Äîfirst proposed by the SYL and other nascent Somali political organizations that were then agitating for independence, such as the Marehan Union Party, Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) (which later became Hizbia Dastur Mustaqbal Somali) and the SNL‚Äî that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.Aristide R.

It was situated near the frontiers of Elis, and on the high road from Arcadia to Olympia. Its territory was called the Heraeatis or Heraiatis (·º©œÅŒ±Œπ·æ∂œÑŒπœÇ). According to Greek mythology it was said to have been founded by Heraeus, a son of Lycaon, and to have been called originally Sologorgus. At an early period the Heraeans concluded a treaty with the Eleians for mutual protection and support for one hundred years; the original of which treaty, engraved on a bronze tablet in the old Peloponnesian dialect, was brought from Olympia, and is now in the British Museum. This treaty is placed about the 50th Olympiad, or 580 BCE, since it belongs to a time when the Eleians exercised an undisputed supremacy over the dependent districts of Pisatis and Triphylia; and the Heraeans consequently were anxious to avail themselves of their support. Heraea was, at that time, the chief village among eight others which lay scattered upon the banks of the Alpheius and its tributaries the Ladon and Erymanthus; but the inhabitants of these separate villages were transferred to Heraea, and a city there was founded by the Spartan king Cleombrotus I or Cleonymus. In consequence of their close connection with Sparta, the Heraeans incurred the hostility of the other Arcadians, who laid waste their territory in 370 BCE. At a later time Heraea was a member of the Achaean League; and, as Elis was one of the chief places of the Aetolian League, it is frequently mentioned in the contests between these two powers. It was afterwards in the hands of Philip V of Macedon, but it was restored to the Achaeans. Heraea is mentioned by Strabo as one of the deserted cities of Arcadia; but when it was visited by Pausanias, it was still a place of some importance. The latter writer describes its temples, baths, plantations of myrtles and other trees along the banks of the Alpheius: among its temples he mentions two sacred to Dionysus, one to Pan, and another to Hera, of the latter of which only some ruins were left.-2. The site of Heraea is fixed by its distance from the mouth of the Ladon, which, according to Pausanias, was 15 stadia. The same writer says that the greater part of the city lay upon a gently sloping hill, and the remainder upon the banks of the Alpheius. The remains of Heraea are visible on a hill west of the village of Agios Ioannis (St. John), bounded on either side by a ravine, and sloping down towards the river. These ruins extend along the summit of the hill and the slope towards the river; but they are inconsiderable, and have for the most part been cleared away in consequence of the fertility of the land. The wine of Heraea was celebrated in antiquity, and was said to make women fruitful.Theophr. H. Pl. 9.20; Athen. 1.31; Aelian, VH 13.6; Heraea was favourably situated in several respects. Its territory was fertile, and it was situated on the high road from Olympia into the interior of Arcadia. From the north of Arcadia a road led into the valley of the Alpheius, near Heraea; and two roads led into the Heraeatis, one from Megalopolis, and the other from Messene and Phigalia, which joined the former close to the town. There was a bridge over the Alpheius close to Heraea, which Philip restored in 219 BCE. The Heraeatis was separated from Pisatis by the river Erymanthus, and from the territory of Megalopolis by the river Buphagus. The famous Tabula Peutingeriana shows a road system connecting Heraia with ancient Olympia, Melaneae and Megalopolis. It is located on the Alpheios river near Agios Ioannis, a few miles south-west of the modern village of Loutra Iraias, in the municipality of Gortynia in the western Peloponnese, Greece. The modern municipal unit of Iraia is named after it. People Famous Olympic champions from Heraia include Demaretos (520 BCE), his son Theopompos (516 BCE), his grandson Theopompos and others. Religion The cult of Pan in Heraia differed from similar cults in central Arcadia. A famous statue of Pan with the face of Apollo, created by Polykleitos, was located in Heraia and can be seen stamped on gold coins from the region dating to the 4th century BCE. Silver coins of that era represented Hera, the city's patron goddess. Excavation The site of Heraia was excavated by archeologist Alexander Philadelpheus in 1931. Today, the site remains generally closed to the public.

Born in what was then British Guiana, she moved in the 1950s to the United Kingdom, where she became the first black headteacher in London. She was the wife of Patrick Gilroy, and the mother of academic Paul Gilroy, and Darla Gilroy. Early years Beryl Gilroy was born in Skeldon, Berbice, Guyana.Deosaran, Venessa, \\"Guyanese novelist Beryl Gilroy\\", Guyana Times International, 24 November 2011. She grew up in a large, extended family, largely under the influence of her maternal grandmother, Sally Louisa James (1868‚Äì1967), a herbalist, who managed the family small-holding, was a keen reader and imparted to the young Beryl stories of \\"Long Bubbies\\", Cabresses and Long Lady and a treasury of colloquial Guyanese proverbs. Gilroy did not enter full-time schooling until she was 12, this was influenced by her grandmother. Sally Louisa James, Gilroy's grandmother thought Gilroy would be able to learn more from life, if she had life different life experiences and more freedom, typically not something someone could gain from primary school. Gilroy was heavily influenced by her grandmother in all her aspects of life, she found inspiration from her grandmother's stories in her own writings. She also used the same methodology that her grandmother used when it came to schooling her own children. Gilroy homeschooled her son and daughter with the same focus on freedom that her grandmother had for her. From 1943 to 1945, she attended teacher training college in Georgetown, gaining a first-class diploma. She subsequently taught and lectured on a UNICEF nutrition programme. In 1951, at the age of 27, she was selected to attend university in the United Kingdom. Between 1951 and 1953 she attended the University of London, pursuing a Diploma in Child Development.Obano, Nisha, \\"Beryl Gilroy\\", Enciclopedia de Estudios Afroeuropeos. Teaching career Gilroy's first teaching job was in Guiana in the late 1940s up until 1951. She later left Guiana and went to attend the University of London. Gilroy assumed since she was a qualified teacher, and respected teacher from Guiana she believed she would not have a problem looking for a teaching job in London. However, during this time in the early 1950s racism was still strongly prevalent. Her prospective employers denied her for a long time because she was a black woman. It was not until the late 1960s that Gilroy was actually able to teach again. She was employed by the Inner London Education Authority, at a \\"poor Catholic School\\" she taught for a couple of years, married scientist Patrick GilroyWilliams, Paul, Paul Gilroy, Routledge, 2013 (), p. 19. (d. 1975), and spent the next 12 years at home bringing up and educating their children Darla and Paul, furthering her own higher education. In 1968 she returned to teaching and eventually became the first Black headteacher in London, at Beckford School in West Hampstead.Momoh, Emily, \\"More Black History Month News\\" . Black History Makers in Camden. It was difficult for her during this time since many of her coworkers were prejudice against her, and the low wage she received compared to other teachers at her school, she continued teaching regardless of all of that.. Many of these experiences she had as a teacher in London lead her to write her novel Black Teacher (1976). = Black Teacher (1976) = Black Teacher was written to not only show the experience of a woman teacher but as a black woman teacher. It was received widely as disturbing information rather than it just being seen as a narrative. \\"The heroine of Black Teacher is at times boastful, defensive, aggressive, kind and humorous. She is a flawed human being in the process of finding her place in an alien society that failed to appreciate her and where racial abuse was rife. Reflecting this instability, the narrator's voice slips between a third-person 'pedantic' narrator who is confident, professional and self-assured and the autobiographical 'I' which is much more provisional and self-doubting. Gilroy moves the narrator between the multiple identities that she has created in order to deal with difficult situations.\\" This book was meant to showcase Gilroy's personal experiences about teaching in London. Many publishers, and other writers tried to discredit her writing saying her experiences weren't that such of the ones she had written about in Black Teacher. They tried to unjustify it by saying it was easier than she had described getting a job as a teacher, and that the racism in the book wasn't likely to be as bad as she perceived it to be.  Other work  Gilroy had many other jobs than just teaching. Previously stated above before she was able to become a teacher in London, Gilroy worked in a cafe, she was a maid, a dishwasher, and a worked in a factory. While she homeschooling her children she would also read and review works for a publisher. Later she worked as a multi-cultural researcher at the Institute of Education, University of London,Busby, Margaret (ed.), Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent (1992), London: Vintage, 1993, p. 309. and developed a pioneering practice in psychotherapy, working mainly with Black women and children. She was a co-founder in the early 1980s of the Camden Black Sisters group. She gained a PhD in counselling psychology from an American university in 1987 while working at the Institute of Education. Writing Gilroy's creative writing began in childhood, as a teacher for children and then in the 1960s when she began writing what was later published by Peepal Tree Press as In Praise of Love and Children. Between 1970 and 1975 she wrote the pioneering children's series Nippers, containing probably the first reflection of the Black British presence in UK writing for children. Her 1976 memoir about her experiences as the first black headteacher in London is described by Sandra Courtman as \\"an unconventional autobiography ... [Black Teacher] is Gilroy's experiment with an intermediary form ‚Äì somewhere between fiction and autobiography, with a distinct non-linear structure.\\"Courtman, Sandra, \\"Woman version: Beryl Gilroy's Black Teacher\\", Discovering Literature: 20th century, British Library, 4 October 2018. It was not until 1986 that Gilroy's first novel, the award-winning Frangipani House was published (Heinemann). It won a GLC Creative Writing Prize in 1982. Set in an old person's home in Guyana, it reflects one of her professional concerns: the position of ethnic minority elders and her persistent emphasis on the drive for human freedom. Boy Sandwich (Heinemann) was published in 1989, followed by Stedman and Joanna: A Love in Bondage (Vantage, 1991), and a collection of poems, Echoes and Voices (Vantage, 1991). Then came Sunlight and Sweet Water, Gather the Faces, In Praise of Love and Children and Inkle and Yarico (all Peepal Tree, 1994). Her last novel, The Green Grass Tango (Peepal Tree) was published in 2001, sadly after Beryl Gilroy's death in April of that year. Gilroy's early work examined the impact of life in Britain on West Indian families and her later work explored issues of African and Caribbean diaspora and slavery. In 1998, a collection of her non-fiction writing, entitled Leaves in the Wind, came out from Mango Publishing. It included her lectures, notes, essays, dissertations and personal reviews.Gilroy, Beryl, Leaves in the Wind: Collected Writings, Mango Publishing, 1998. In this book she stated that the purpose behind Black Teacher and much of her other writing was \\"to set the record straight. There had been Ted Braithwaite's To Sir With Love [1959] and Don Hinds‚Äô Journey to an Illusion [1966] but the woman's experiences had never been stated.\\"Gilroy, Leaves in the Wind, 1998, p. 9. She also later noted: \\"In the tradition of Black women who write to come to terms with their trauma, or alternatively to understand the nature of their elemental oppression, I wrote to redefine myself and put the record straight.\\"Gilroy, Leaves in the Wind, 1998, p. 209. In Gilroy's writings she drew much of her inspiration from stories her grandmother would tell her about British Guiana. She also was inspired from her own life experiences, such her work before becoming a teacher, and the racism she experienced while being one of the first black head teachers in London. Although many of Gilroy's peers who were writing Caribbean Literature were being published, Gilroy was turned away very often in the beginning. Her writings were seen to be too \\"...colonial, and unknowing, and ... psychological and strange.\\" Some of her writings weren't published for more than 30 years after she had written them. After many years she was finally able to share her work with the public, and to this day she is remembered as a part of black feminist movement, but that isn't how she wanted to be remembered. \\"She badly wanted to avoid being marginalised by any literary or black-feminist political label.\\"  Writing style  Beryl Gilroy was a Caribbean Fiction and nonFiction writer. Many of her writings at the beginning of her career were Postcolonial Fiction novels and short stories. While near the end of her career she published a collection of her journals, lecture notes, essays and personal review. Her fiction writings were inspired by her life, and stories she was told by her grandmother in her childhood in Guiana. Her writings typically were based on Caribbean characters, many of which are women Caribbean characters. She wrote from the woman's perspective because that is what she knew. She wanted to give black women something they could relate too. Although, at the time many of the other Caribbean writers that were published at the time were writing from the male point of view. Gilroy was often Criticized for \\"Writing at the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô time and in the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô gender, the work of Beryl Gilroy was subject to misunderstandings and neglect. But Gilroy was the ultimate outsider who broke down barriers to clear a cultural and creative space for subsequent generations.\\"  Death and legacy  Gilroy died of a heart attack at the age of 76 on 4 April 2001. As noted by Roxann Bradshaw: \\"Two days later over one hundred Anglophone women writers from around the world gathered at Goldsmiths College in London, where Dr Gilroy had been scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the 4th annual Caribbean Women Writers Association conference. The news of her death was received with great sorrow for the passing of one of the first wave of Anglophone women writers, whose contribution to Caribbean women's literature is invaluable.\\"Bradshaw, Roxann, \\"Beryl Gilroy's 'Fact-Fiction': Through the Lens of the 'Quiet Old Lady'\\", Callaloo, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Spring 2002), pp. 381‚Äì400. Honours and recognition After many years of neglect in Beryl Gilroy's life she finally began receiving recognition for her work. She eventually received many honours, and awards late in her career as a writer. Gilroy wrote The Nippers Series which was written throughout the 1960s-1970s, they were several short stories made for children. This Series won her over sixteen awards. She received the GLC Creative Writing Prize for her novel Frangipani House from 1986. Gilroy was honoured in 1990 by the Greater London Council for all of her services in education.

He has been described as \\"one of the 21st century's greatest literary sensations.\\" Since the completion of the My Struggle series in 2011, he has also published an autobiographical series entitled The Seasons Quartet, as well as critical work on the art of Edvard Munch.  Biography  Born in Oslo, Knausg√•rd was raised on Trom√∏ya in Arendal and in Kristiansand, and studied arts and literature at the University of Bergen. He then held various jobs, including teaching high school, selling cassettes, working in a psychiatric hospital and on an oil platform, while trying to become a writer. He eventually moved to Stockholm and published his first novel in 1998.Karl Ove Knausgaard interview The New Republic 8 April 2014  Literary career  =Debut and follow-up= Knausg√•rd made his publishing debut in 1998 with the novel Out of the World, for which he was awarded the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature. This was the first time in the award's history that a debut novel had won.Hermione Hoby, \\"Karl Ove Knausgaard: Norway's Proust and a life laid painfully bare,\\" The Guardian, March 1, 2014. His second novel, A Time for Everything (2004), partly retells certain parts of the Bible as well as the history of angels on earth. The book won a number of awards, and was nominated for the Nordic Council's Literature Prize. It was also nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award. It was called a \\"strange, uneven, and marvelous book\\" by The New York Review of Books.Ingrid D. Rowland, \\"The Primordial Struggle,\\" The New York Review of Books, October 14, 2010. = The Min Kamp books = While Knausg√•rd¬¥s two first books were well received, it was the six-volume Min Kamp series of autobiographical novels that made Knausg√•rd a household name in Norway. Published from 2009 to 2011 and totaling over 3,500 pages, the books were hugely successful and also caused much controversy.James Wood, \\"Total Recall\\". The New Yorker, 13 August 2012. The controversy was caused partly because the Norwegian title of the book, Min Kamp, is the same as the Norwegian title of Hitler's Mein Kampf, and partly because some have suggested Knausg√•rd goes too far in exposing the private lives of his friends and family‚Äîincluding his father, ex-wife, uncle, and grandmother. The books have nevertheless received almost universally favorable reviews, in particular, the first two volumes. Even before the final book's publication, they were one of the greatest publishing phenomena in Norway ever. In a country of five million people, the Min Kamp series has sold over 450,000 copies. The Min Kamp series is currently being translated into numerous languages. The earliest books have already been published to great critical acclaim in Denmark, Sweden, and several other countries. All six have been translated into English by Don Bartlett for publication by Archipelago Books (US) and Harvill Secker (UK), and have been retitled in Britain as A Death in the Family, A Man in Love, Boyhood Island, Dancing in the Dark, Some Rain Must Fall, and The End (The End translated by Bartlett and Martin Aitken). =Work following Min Kamp= Knausg√•rd served as a consultant to the new Norwegian translation of the Bible. In 2013, he published a collection of essays, Sjelens Amerika: tekster 1996‚Äì2013 (\\"\\"), and as of September 2013 he is adapting his novel Out of the World into a screenplay.Nina Berglund (4 September 2013): \\"Knausgaard cancels all appearances\\", Views and News from Norway; retrieved 7 November 2013. Between 2015 and 2016, Knausgaard published his Seasons Quartet, a series of four books entitled Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer. These books are also autobiographical in nature, consisting of diary excerpts, letters, and other personal materials. These books were released in English between 2017 and 2018. Knausgaard has also written works devoted to the visual arts. He co-authored Anselm Kiefer: Transition from Cool to Warm, a book in 2018 on the German artist Anselm Kiefer with James Lawrence. In 2019, Knausgaard published a monograph on the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, and his interview about Munch also appeared as a highlight of the British Museum's 2019 exhibition catalog, Edvard Munch: Love and Angst, by curator Giulia Bartrum. In October 2019 Knausg√•rd became the sixth writer chosen to contribute to the Future Library project.  Editing career  Between 1999 and 2002 Knausg√•rd was co-editor of Vagant, a Norwegian literary magazine founded in 1988. He was part of the first editorial team of Vagant in Bergen; until 1999 the magazine had been based in Oslo. Knausg√•rd contributed essays about the writings of Don DeLillo and The Divine Comedy by Dante. He also conducted in-depth interviews with the Norwegian writers Rune Christiansen and Thure Erik Lund for the magazine. Just after he left Vagant and Bergen, his former co-editor Preben Jordal wrote a very negative review of Knausg√•rd's second novel in the magazine, with the title ¬´Mellom Bibel og babbel¬ª (\\"Between the Bible and babble\\")‚Äîan episode discussed in the second volume of Min Kamp.  Publishing career  In 2010, he founded a small, eclectic publishing house, Pelikanen (Pelican), with his brother Yngve Knausg√•rd and Asbj√∏rn Jensen. Pelikanen has so far published Denis Johnson, Peter Handke, Christian Kracht, Ben Marcus, Curzio Malaparte and Stig Larsson in Norwegian translations. Personal life Knausg√•rd lived in √ñsterlen, Sweden, with his wife, the writer Linda Bostr√∂m Knausg√•rd, and their four children until November 2016 when he and his wife separated. He now lives between Blackheath, London and Sweden. In a radio interview with his estranged ex-wife, Tonje Aursland, who plays a part in several of the Min Kamp books, Knausg√•rd admitted that he sometimes feels that he has made a \\"Faustian bargain\\"‚Äîthat he has achieved huge success by sacrificing his relationships with friends and members of his family. In October 2010, Aursland presented her perspective on involuntarily becoming a subject of her ex-husband's autobiography in a radio documentary broadcast on NRK. Knausg√•rd's uncle, who is represented as Gunnar in the Min Kamp books, has been highly critical of the whole project in the Norwegian press.Eivind Kristensen, \\"¬´Onkel Gunnar¬ª tar knallhardt oppgj√∏r med Knausg√•rd\\" (in Norwegian), Aftenposten, 17 November 2011.

The clockbug is an insect species whose legs have atrophied, mobility being unnecessary for its existence since it lives by consuming its own feces, merely using its antennae to rotate in a counter-clockwise fashion, continuously manifesting a circular trail of excretion and ingestion. The organism's slow metabolic rate allows time for nutrients in its feces to be replenished by bacterial action. It eats from dawn until sunset and sleeps through the night, and since it is heliotropic - with its head always pointing towards the sun - it also functions as a timepiece. The protagonist of The Ark Sakura, known as Pig (though preferring to be called Mole), identifies with the clockbug and marvels at the resemblance he sees between himself and the insect. At one point he remarks: :I believe that the eupcaccia is symbolic of a certain philosophy or way of life. However much you may move around, as long as the motion is circular you haven't really gone anywhere; the important thing is to maintain a tranquil inner core. The clockbug's variant name, eupcaccia, suggests a combination of the prefix eu-, meaning good and the Italian word caccia, meaning hunt, in other words, good hunting. The name also suggests a combination of caccia and eupeptic, meaning having good digestion and cheerful, optimistic. Considerable irony follows from the latter suggestion, as Pig/Mole is a paranoid survivalist who has built and inhabits an enormous nuclear fallout shelter in an abandoned quarry.

The building is used as a conference and retreat centre by the Church of England dioceses of Leicester and Peterborough. History front view The abbey is an Elizabethan manor house, extensively modified, originally built on the site of an Augustinian priory, Launde Priory. The original priory was founded before 1125 (in 1119 according to a modern inscription in the reception hall) by Richard Basset and his wife Matilda (n√©e Ridel). Its revenues at the dissolution of the monasteries were ¬£510-16-1d and payments ¬£117-12-10d (annual value almost ¬£400).Curtis (1831); pp. 93-94 Launde is set in countryside in the valley of the River Chater. Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's chief minister responsible for the dissolution of the monasteries, so liked its position that he wrote in his diary \\"Myself for Launde\\". But Cromwell never occupied the house as he was executed in 1540 for treason. In that same year the building of the new house commenced. His son, Gregory, lived at Launde Abbey for ten years after its construction with his wife, Elizabeth, the sister of Jane Seymour the third wife of Henry VIII. In 1603 Launde was acquired by William Smith and in 1763 Dorothy Jennings sold it to John Simpson; in 1828, Mary Finch Simpson married Edward Dawson (1802-1859) of Long Whatton who by this marriage acquired Launde.Curtis (1831); p. 94. They engaged Thomas Rickman to restore the house from 1829 to 1839. The Dawsons continued to own the estate throughout the 19th century. In 1957, Cecil Coleman and his wife bought the abbey and presented it to the Diocese of Leicester. They paid for the conversion works to make it into a retreat house.Parks and gardens website The chapel is thought to be all that remains of the original priory church. Some of its stained glass is mediaeval and Nikolaus Pevsner has described the monument to Gregory Cromwell as \\"one of the purest monuments of the early Renaissance in England\\". There are numerous memorials of the Simpson family who bought Launde in 1763 and enlarged the house and laid out the plantations.Firth, J. B. (1926) Highways and Byways in Leicestershire. London: Macmillan; pp. 240-41. The chapel is used for daily worship by the resident community and guests and is an attraction for visitors. In 2009 the abbey launched a successful ¬£1 million appeal to bring the house up to the standards required by legislation. If the money had not been raised, the abbey would have been forced to close.12th-century Church retreat house faces closure because of health and safety Daily Telegraph; 1 May 2009 Both the abbey and the associated chapel are Grade II* listed buildings.

He succeeded his relative, probably an uncle, Eustochius, and was succeeded by another close relative, Saint Volusianus. Born of a senatorial family, he became bishop of Tours around 460. It is said of him that he dedicated the revenues of his estates to the relief of those in need. Appointed about 460, he guided the Church of Tours for thirty years, and it is apparent, from what little information we have, that during his administration Christianity was considerably developed and consolidated in Touraine. Shortly after his elevation, St. Perpetuus presided at a council in which eight bishops who were reunited in Tours on the Feast of St. Martin had participated, and at this assembly an important rule was promulgated relative to ecclesiastical discipline. He maintained a careful surveillance over the conduct of the clergy of his diocese, and mention is made of priests who were removed from their office because they had proved unworthy. He built monasteries and various churches, but above all he desired to replace by a beautiful basilica (470) the little chapel that Saint Britius had constructed, to protect the tomb of St. Martin of Tours. He is noted for his great veneration for St. Martin and enlarged the place to accommodate the influx of pilgrims to the saint's tomb. St. Gregory of Tours states that Perpetuus decreed that all of the members of his diocese should fast on Wednesdays and Fridays, except for a few church festivals.

Hib is thought to have been compiled by two Irish scholars working in the late 7th or 8th century, C√∫ Chuimne of Iona (died 747) and Ruben of Dairinis (died 725).  Overview  =Age and manuscript tradition= Hib is one of the oldest systematic canon law collections in Europe. It was compiled in Ireland between 669 and 748. Its compilers are believed to have been C√∫ Chuimne of Iona (‚Ä†747) and Ruben of Dairinis (‚Ä†725).Charles-Edwards, ‚ÄòConstruction‚Äô, 213 n. 7. For a summary of past arguments on the authorship of the Hibernensis, see Davies, ‚ÄòIsidorian texts‚Äô, 212‚Äì15. The attribution of Hib to these two men is problematical, however, because it is based solely on a garbled colophon found in a ninth-century manuscript from Brittany with a Corbie and Saint-Germain provenance (now in Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale, Lat. 12021).On the colophon see R. Thurneysen, ‚ÄòZur irischen Kanonensammlung‚Äô, Zeitschrift f√ºr Celtische Philologie 6 (1907‚Äì08), 1‚Äì5; and on problems in accepting the authority of this colophon, see Dumville, ‚ÄòTransmission and use‚Äô, 86. For another consideration of the identities of Ruben and C√∫ Chuimne, including their possible political and ideological affiliations, see B. Jaski, ‚ÄòC√∫ Chuimne, Ruben, and the compilation of the Collectio canonum Hibernensis‚Äô, Peritia 14 (2000), 51‚Äì69. The earliest manuscript witness, according to Rob Meens of Utrecht University, is an early eighth-century collection preserved in Copenhagen (KB 58); Meens in fact refers to the manuscript as a \\"forerunner\\" of the Hibernensis. Several recensions of the collection may have circulated in the early Middle Ages, but the two main recensions (called A and B), containing between 65 and 69 books (the division of books varies between manuscripts), seem to date from an early stage of the collection's circulation. Hib circulated widely on the Continent in the eighth and ninth centuries, particularly in Brittany,Mordek, ed., Kirchenrecht, 255‚Äì59; Reynolds, ‚ÄòUnity and diversity‚Äô; Dumville, ‚ÄòTransmission and use‚Äô; and had a particularly strong influence on Italian canonistic thought after the ninth century.R. Reynolds, ‚ÄòExcerpta from the Collectio Hibernensisn three Vatican manuscripts‚Äô, Bulletin of medieval canon law n.s. 5 (1975), 1‚Äì9, who cites on p. 1 seminal work on the subject by Paul Fournier. It may have played a role in the anointment of Pepin the Short as king of Francia in 751, on the advice of Vergilius of Salzburg.Enright, M.J. Iona, Tara, and Soissons: The Origin of the Royal Anointing Ritual. (Arbeiten zur Fr√ºmittelalterforschung, 17) Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1985. Pp. ix, 198. =Contents= Beyond topics typically covered by canon law collections, Hib touches on prayer, consecrated places, martyrs, the ‚Äòsubstances of men‚Äô, blessings, and the soul; indeed, certain chapters often verge on essays on morality. Maurice P. Sheehy said of Hib, ‚Äòas a single document, [it] is probably the most ambitious endeavour to codify Christian life of all the medieval canonical compilations.‚ÄôSheehy, ‚ÄòCeltic phenomenon‚Äô, 527. A relatively small portion of the work comprises excerpts from ancient canons and decretals; far more common are citations of Scripture and the Church Fathers‚ÄïOrigen, Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory I, and Gregory Nazianzenus being most prominent among these. Its use of Greek Fathers as sources for canon law has been called ‚Äòunique‚Äô.Davies, ‚ÄòIsidorian texts‚Äô, 212. Not including quotations inside excerpted patristic writers, Hib contains about 1,000 quotations of Scripture, two-thirds of which come from the Old Testament.M.P. Sheehy, ‚ÄòThe Bible and the Collectio canonum Hibernensis‚Äô, in Irland und die Christenheit, eds N√≠ Chath√°in and Richter, 277‚Äì83, at 281. Fournier-le Bras, Histoire, 63, counted around 500 biblical quotations. Thomas Charles-Edwards considered the methods by which the compiler(s) of this collection organized their material: \\"the Hibernensis both contains and relies on exegesis to a far greater extent than do such collections as those of Dionysius Exiguus\\".Charles-Edwards, ‚ÄòConstruction‚Äô, 230. The compiler, or ‚Äòexegete‚Äô as Charles-Edwards calls him, was interested not only in presenting decisions, but in finding answers to questions on morality; it was the compiler‚Äôs own moral preoccupations, as well as his own interpretation of his sources that determined the shape and content of the collection.Charles- Edwards, ‚ÄòConstruction‚Äô, 234‚Äì36. The compiler‚Äôs use of testimonia and exempla to prove a rule sometimes led him to take a ‚Äòdialectical‚Äô approach to legal questions, in which he would present opposing rules on a single topic and attempt some sort of crude reconciliation, though usually this reconciliation is only ever implied. For some scholars, this has qualified Hib as something of a summa discordantium.Charles-Edwards, ‚ÄòConstruction‚Äô, 210. The term summa discordantium is Sheehy‚Äôs, ‚ÄòCeltic Phenomenon‚Äô, 527, on which see also Sheehy, ‚ÄòThe Bible‚Äô, 277‚Äì78. For a discussion of the ideological implications of the ‚Äòdialectical‚Äô style of Hib‚Äînamely its relevance to the ‚Äònativising and internationalising tendencies within Irish Christianity‚Äô in the seventh and eighth centuries‚Äîsee Dumville, ‚ÄòTransmission and use‚Äô, 86. The exegetical and essaic qualities of Hib were signalled by Gabriel le Bras when he argued that Hib is ‚Äòmore than a canonical collection, but a repository of scriptural and patristic texts on discipline, which the author accepted as the principal sources of the law. This characteristic of the Hibernensis quite naturally results in its embracing a much wider domain than the other collections: not only the entire domain of the ecclesiastical institution, but also the realm of the social and spiritual life.‚Äô Hib was not the only form of law available in medieval Ireland. A secular law, more commonly known as the Brehon Laws, existed and is often at variance with Hib, although perhaps more surprising is their tendency to overlap. Sources for the Collection Canonum Hibernensis Hib was an attempt to make available diverse authorities for use by Canon Jurists. Among the sources included are: * the Collectio canonum Turonensis * collections of Gallic and other Continental canons * ecclesiastical histories * a definition by Virgil Maro Grammaticus * a compusticial tract by Pseudo- Theophilus * spurious 'Acts' of the council of Caesarea * several quotes from all but one of the works of Isidore of Seville * so-called dicta of Saint Patrick.

Both teams fought against Kid Colt. =World War II= Originally a spy organization employed by the Nazis during World War II, Tiboldt's Circus was a traveling circus led by Fritz Tiboldt, the Ringmaster, and he and his performers would use their special skills and talents to rob their audiences. He was sent to America to murder US Government officials using the cover of his circus activities. Tiboldt and his gang fell afoul of Captain America and were deported back to Germany, where Fritz Tiboldt and his wife were subsequently murdered by their former employers. =Present day= The current Circus of Crime first came to the authorities' attention when they carried out a series of robberies of small towns using the Ringmaster's skill in hypnotism to mesmerize entire towns. Regrettably for the Circus, Rick Jones was one of the victims of their capers, and his involvement led to the involvement of the Hulk, as Rick briefly had telepathic control over the Hulk. He resisted the Ringmaster's hypnotism when the Ringmaster tried to bill him as 'The Monster of the Age', leading to the Circus' arrest. After a brief stretch in prison, the Circus visited New York City, where they battled both Spider-Man and Daredevil. The Ringmaster was briefly able to hypnotise Spider-Man. The Circus' core members later briefly operated as the Masters of Menace, a name thought up by Princess Python, after being released from prison and throwing the Ringmaster off the team, replacing him with the Clown. They were again captured by Spider-Man.Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 28: \\"New recruit Princess Python staged a coup that saw established member the Clown become leader of the troupe.\\" The Circus of Crime established themselves as recurrent antagonists in several Marvel Comics series, where they briefly attempted to recruit Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch into their ranks when the Avengers had been disbanded. The Ringmaster later hypnotized Thor into assisting with one of the Circus' schemes while the Thunder God was stripped of most of his powers except his strength. Battling the Avengers again, they attempted to sabotage the Wasp and Yellowjacket's wedding.Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: \\"This bizarre wedding tale saw...the Circus of Crime serving as the prerequisite wedding crashers.\\" Other encounters pitted them against Daredevil and Power Man. They later fought Power Pack and Generation X. Initially depicted as credible villains, the Circus of Crime's members were gradually used by writers as comic foils, and were once defeated by Howard the Duck. They were featured as antagonists in the first issue of the Sensational She-Hulk series, in which writer John Byrne regularly used minor or forgotten characters for parodic purposes. The Ringmaster's new iteration of the group known as Cirque Du Nuit later surfaces, acting as enemies of Hawkeye and Kate Bishop. Around this time, they have new members such as a female archer named Fifi and an unnamed protege of the Swordsman.

Legislation  Legislation governing what a fringe benefit is, and is not, is contained within part CX of the Income Tax Act 2007. The imposition of FBT is contained within part RD of the Income Tax Act 2007. The categories of benefits include motor vehicles, low-interest loans, free, subsidised or discounted goods and services, employer contributions to funds, insurance and superannuation schemes and other benefits.  Paying FBT  FBT filing may be quarterly, finance year, or annual tax returns. Taxpayers must pay quarterly unless they qualify for, and have elected to, use another period for filing. Since 1 April 2001, FBT has been payable using one of two options. The Single Rate Option (whereby FBT is paid at the highest FBT rate on all employees), or the alternate rate option (formerly the multi-rate option, which involves attribution of benefits to individual employees and pooling of non- attributable benefits and certain de minimis benefits). There is a 'short form' way of calculating under the alternate rate option, which is simply to pool non-attributable and de minimis benefits but pay the highest rate of FBT on remaining benefits rather than attribute to employees.

Alexander Vasilyevich Krivoshein () (July 19 (31 (N.S.), 1857, Warsaw ‚Äì October 28, 1921, Berlin) was a Russian monarchist politician and Minister of Agriculture under Pyotr Stolypin.  Life  Graduate in law of St. Petersburg University. Worked in the Ministry of Justice and later in the Ministry of the Interior (1884‚Äì1896). Assistant Head of the Department of Peasant Colonization (1896‚Äì1904), and Head (1904‚Äì1905). Assistant Head of the Chief Administration of Land Organization and Agriculture (1905‚Äì1906). Member of the State Council (1906). Assistant Minister of Finance (1906‚Äì1908). Krivoshein served as Russia's Minister of Agriculture between 1908 and 1915. He was one of the few ministers, who was respected by the Emperor and government circles, as well as the educated public. Most of the commissioners appointed by him were the members of the public, rather than administrators or businesspersons. Krivoshein was one of the principal ministers involved in the implementation of the Stolypin agrarian reforms. He supported large private capital in industry, because he believed that the private investment would free up more state funds for agriculture. However, for agriculture, he favored the individual peasant and the noble landowner. During the ministerial debates in 1913‚Äì14, his ministry did not oppose the expansion of joint-stock companies in the industry, but fought to limit their role in the land purchases. His ministry also got a ban on Jews holding managerial positions in stock companies involved in the land purchases. In 1915, Krivoshein headed the \\"Special Council for Discussion and Coordinating Measures for Food Supply\\". He was a moderate politician,Leroy Allen. Social Sciences. Pi Gamma Mu.

He was one of several ministers to be dismissed for opposing Nicholas II's decision to take command of the Russian Army. Krivoshein rejected the February Revolution of 1917. After the October Revolution of 1917, he joined the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Crimea. He tried to save the Russian emperor, when the latter was moved from Tomsk to Yekaterinburg, organizing an anti- Bolshevik conspiracy in Moscow, and barely escaping arrest. He also served as the head of General Wrangel's government in Crimea. Later, he went into exile in France. His son, Igor A. Krivoshein, was an engineer and high-ranking Freemason in France.

Their first demos (Hitler Demo and The Mojo Sessions) was heavily influenced by English punk rock, especially Sex Pistols and The Clash, with hilarious lyrics, but soon after attending a CBGB show of the Bad Brains, singer Jesse Malin and guitarist Jackie Flanagan decided to switch genres to the latest wave of punk, hardcore. Heart Attack existed for less than four years, part of the NYC hardcore scene with other bands such as the Beastie Boys, Kraut, Bad Brains, The Undead, The Mad, Reagan Youth, The Misguided and Even Worse. Heart Attack was the first band of the area to go on tour in the rest of the United States. Their final show was on July 4, 1984 at CBGB. All of their songs are now published in \\"The Last War 1980-84\\" CD. Malin went on to form the bands The Finger and D Generation (also with later Heart Attack guitarist Danny Sage), and later, a successful solo career.

It is a highly hydrophobic microcrystalline powder. Its CAS number is . In contrast to graphite intercalation compounds it is a covalent graphite compound. Carbon is stable in a fluorine atmosphere up to about 400 ¬∞C, but between 420-600 ¬∞C a reaction takes place to give substoichiometric carbon monofluoride, CF0.68 appearing dark grey. With increasing temperature and fluorine pressure stoichiometries up to CF1.12 are formed. With increasing fluorine content the colour changes from dark grey to cream white indicating the loss of the aromatic character. The fluorine atoms are located in an alternating fashion above and under the former graphene plane, which is now buckled due to formation of covalent carbon-fluorine bonds. Reaction of carbon with fluorine at even higher temperature successively destroys the graphite compound to yield a mixture of gaseous fluorocarbons such as tetrafluorocarbon, CF4, and tetrafluoroethylene, C2F4.BBC - h2g2 - Carbon and its Inorganic Compounds In a similar fashion the recently found carbon allotrope fullerene, C60 reacts with fluorine gas to give fullerene fluorides with stoichiometries up to C60F48.

Background Charles de Gaulle, circa 1942 Various resistance movements had arisen in France since the start of the German occupation in June 1940. With the possible exception of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans and other groups loyal to the Communist Party of France, the maquis groups were mostly unorganised and unrelated to one another. This lack of coordination made them less effective in their actions against the Nazi occupiers. Formation and Meeting of Resistance Fighters Charles de Gaulle, exiled in London and recognized by the UK as leader of a French government in exile, began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements. On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to Jean Moulin. Moulin achieved the feat on May 27, 1943 with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance in the apartment of Ren√© Corbin on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in Paris. Aside from Moulin and his two assistants, and Robert Chambeiron, participants in the first meeting included representatives of the eight main French resistance movements, members of six of France's major political parties and the two large pre-war trade unions all attended the Rue du Four meeting. Representatives of the eight major resistance movements: *Pierre Villon (Front National) *Roger Coquoin (Ceux de la Lib√©ration) *Jacques Lecompte-Boinet (Ceux de la R√©sistance) *Charles Laurent (Lib√©ration-Nord) *Pascal Copeau (Lib√©ration-Sud) * Jacques-Henri Simon (Organisation Civile et Militaire) *Claude Bourdet (Combat) *Eug√®ne Claudius-Petit (Franc-Tireur) Under Jean Moulin's earlier influence, Combat, Franc-Tireur and Lib√©ration-Sud had already agreed to regroup themselves in January 1943 to create the Mouvements Unis de la R√©sistance, with their joint military arms forming the Arm√©e secr√®te (Secret Army). Representatives of the two trade unions: *Louis Saillant (Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail) *Gaston Tessier (Conf√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Travailleurs Chr√©tiens) Representatives of the six main political parties of the French Third Republic: *Andr√© Mercier (PCF) *Andr√© Le Troquer (Section fran√ßaise de l'Internationale ouvri√®re) *Marc Rucart (Radical-Socialists) *Georges Bidault (Parti d√©mocrate populaire) *Joseph Laniel (l'Alliance D√©mocratique) *Jacques Debu-Bridel (F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine) Arrest of Jean Moulin cross of Lorraine in background However, shortly after the CNR's creation, its president Jean Moulin was arrested at Caluire by the SS. Over the next three days, Moulin was tortured by Klaus Barbie himself, and would die during his transfer to Germany. He divulged no information to his torturers and his silence was likely to have allowed the CNR to pursue its activities. After Moulin's capture and death, the Conseil National de la R√©sistance decided for security reasons to end its plenary sessions and created an executive office of five members, with each member representing his own group and two others. The new office was under the direction of Alexandre Parodi, delegate-general, and Georges Bidault, the new president. On September 9, 1944, Louis Saillant succeeded Bidault as head of the CNR. Programme On March 15, 1944, the CNR adopted, after months of negotiations, the Programme of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance. :fr:Programme of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance The document was strongly influenced by communist groups like the Front National, especially in part II, \\"Measures to be taken immediately after the liberation of the territory\\", which envisioned the establishment of a social democracy with a planned economy in France after liberation. Some of the proposed measures were applied, at least to a certain extent, after liberation, including the nationalisation of energy (√âlectricit√© de France was founded in 1946), insurance companies (AGF in 1945) and banks (Cr√©dit Lyonnais in 1945, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in 1946), the creation of social security programs and the independence of trade unions. They are many of the so-called acquis sociaux (social rights) of the second half of the 20th century in France.

Plot Caterina (Alice Teghil) is the 13-year-old only child of Giancarlo Iacovoni (Sergio Castellitto), an aspiring novelist and teacher of accounting at a country school in an area north of Rome that one character describes as \\"hillbilly country.\\" In spite of his often lucid assessments of modern society, Iacovoni is a typically burned-out teacher whom his job (perhaps among other, undisclosed personal experiences) has imbued with bitterness and social resentment, with a sheer lack of perspective concerning human relations, and with an overbearing, holier-than-thou demeanor that is a major plot point throughout the movie. He relocates his daughter Caterina and his timid, long-suffering wife Agata (Margherita Buy) to his birthplace, Rome, after having finally secured a long-coveted teaching position. The family settles in Giancarlo's former district, where he reconnects with his neighbor and childhood friend, Fabietto (Silvio Vannucci). Once settled in the Italian capital, Caterina enrolls in a fast-track high school. She immediately finds herself pulled between two competing student cliques: a leftist bohemian contingent headed by Margherita Rossi-Chaillet and a right-leaning group headed by Daniela Germano. Both clique leaders come from socially prominent families. Margherita's mother is a noted intellectual and political writer. Daniela's father is a right-wing government minister (loosely inspired by real politician Gianfranco Fini) who married into a wealthy family. Margherita instantly adopts Caterina as her new best friend. The two girls attend rallies, visit graves of poets, and listen to Nick Cave records. Margherita kisses Caterina, but it's a bit ambiguous as to whether this is to imply sexuality or a pact between them, as she says, to never betray each other. Caterina eventually has a disagreement with Margherita due to being caught by her father drunk and having just gotten a tattoo from Margherita, and begins to gravitate toward Daniela's group. Daniela invites Caterina to join her at a wedding, where Caterina observes a group of neo- fascists pay homage to Daniela's father Manlio who, it is heavily implied, is a covert fascist himself. There is also a subtle hint at an intimate relationship between Daniela and her father's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Caterina's father is trying to capitalize on his daughter's connections. While Caterina is friends with Margherita, Giancarlo secretly gives Margherita a copy of his manuscript to pass along to her mother (with instructions not to tell Caterina), a highly placed editor. Once Caterina becomes friends with Daniela, Giancarlo pays a visit to Daniela's father's office to solicit favors, after having become enraged on a talk show and a laughing stock. He was fired due to hitting a student who was mocking his TV performance and lost his job, leading him to his visit with Signor Germano. After failing to get help from this source as well, he slowly becomes more and more despondent. Caterina then finds out that Daniela and her friends don't like her and \\"tried to make her civilised\\", a disappointment which is compounded by a failed romantic liaison with a wealthy boy from Daniela's clique whom his grandmother forbids from seeing Caterina again. She then lashes out at Daniela and runs away from home only then taking comfort with her neighbor, a young Australian about her age. He has been watching their family and describes them as a soap opera and that she is his favorite character. She then returns home but her family is still in misery. Her father, then, begins shouting about all that matters in the world is tightly knit groups. This is one of the first moments in the movie where Caterina's mother shows her stress and unhappiness by screaming and smashing plates on the floor. Caterina's father remains in his miserable life only working on his motorcycle until he fixes it. Once he does, his newfound optimism is cut short when he casually finds out that either his wife and Fabietto are having an affair or it is a mere question of time before they do‚Äîa fact all the more surprising to him since he had surmised Fabietto to be gay. Unaware that her husband is listening, Agata concedes to Fabietto that she wants to leave Giancarlo but is unable because she doesn't think he could make it on his own. Upon hearing this, Giancarlo then rides off on his motorcycle and is never heard of again; as phrased by Caterina, he \\"doesn't bother our family more, we like to think he's in a place that's making him happy\\". Caterina graduates middle school and is encouraged by Margherita to apply to the conservatory of music. Before leaving on holiday, her young Australian friend explains that he is going back to Australia because his parents are getting back together. She then tells him that, if they ever meet again, she would like to be his girlfriend. She abruptly kisses him; embarrassed she runs back to her mother's car wanting to speed off. The summer includes her playing with her second cousin on the beach, while spending time with her mother and Fabietto. The last shots are of Caterina singing in a performance at her conservatory of music.

Home computer hobbyist with a Hazeltine 1500 (1978) Hazeltine Corporation was a defense electronics company which is now part of BAE Systems Inc. History The company was founded in 1924 by investors to exploit the Neutrodyne patent of Dr. Louis Alan Hazeltine. Headquartered in Greenlawn, Long Island, New York, since 1955, it had facilities in several other locations in Long Island, including its Wheeler Laboratories facility in Smithtown, New York, manufacturing plants in Riverhead and Little Neck, NY, and a division in Braintree, Massachusetts. The company originally concentrated on the design of electronic circuits and the licensing of patents. Innovations in radio, monochrome and later color television components allowed the company to grow. One particularly lucrative design was the Automatic Gain Control circuit. This was such a useful feature that almost every AM radio made used this feature, by license from Hazeltine, from about 1930 until the patent expired. Hazeltine Corporation also developed and licensed many of the basic concepts of the NTSC color television system. From 1955 to 1959 the president of the Hazeltine Company was Philip La Follette, former three-term governor of Wisconsin and son of \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette, who campaigned for president in 1924 as the Progressive Party candidate. The company flourished into the 1980s as a United States Federal defense contractor with particular success as a designer and manufacturer of \\"Identification Friend or Foe\\" (IFF) military detection and identification systems. During the 1970s, as an outgrowth of its defense work, Hazeltine Corp. developed the Hazeltine Terminal, \\"Hazeltine H1500 Video Display Terminal Reference Manual\\", Hazeltine Corporation, July 1977 an early monochrome smart terminal. Several improved models followed, including the popular Hazeltine 1500, which found use in the emerging microcomputer market in the late 1970s. The company eventually sold the terminal line to a short- lived third party called Esprit, which was managed by ex-Hazeltine employees. Hazeltine was acquired by the Emerson Electric Company in 1986. In 1990, Emerson demerged its Government and Defense Group (including Hazeltine) to form ESCO Electronics Corporation. In 1996, Hazeltine was acquired from ESCO by GEC-Marconi Electronic Systems Corp., a US subsidiary of The General Electric Company, and renamed GEC-Marconi Hazeltine. ESCO was represented by investment banking firm Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc. in a deal which valued Hazeltine at $110 million. With the 1999 merger of GEC-Marconi and British Aerospace to form BAE Systems, GEC-Marconi Hazeltine was renamed BAE Systems Advanced Systems. In 2002, it was renamed BAE Systems CNIR (Communication, Navigation, Identification and Reconnaissance). In a 2007 reorganization, the division was folded into BAE Systems Electronics and Integrated Solutions and is currently known as BAE Systems Sensor Systems.  References   External links  *Richard S.

The band was formed in 1981 by guitarist Wander Taffo, drummer Gel Fernandes, bassist Lee Marcucci and singer/keyboardist Willie de Oliveira, all ex-members of Rita Lee's backing band, Tutti Frutti. Their self-titled first album, released in 1982 featured the hits \\"Coisas de Casal\\" (written by Rita Lee with her husband Roberto de Carvalho as a gift to the band), \\"Dentro do Cora√ß√£o (P√µe Devagar)\\" and \\"Garota Dourada\\". The band's popularity skyrocketed with the release of their second album, \\"R√°dio T√°xi 2\\", and the first single out of the album, \\"Eva\\", a Portuguese version of a song by Italian singer Umberto Tozzi. Willie de Oliveira left the band shortly after recording the second album and was replaced by Maur√≠cio Gasperini. With Gasperini now handling vocals and keyboards, they released the albums \\"6:56\\" (1985) and \\"Matriz\\" (1986), featuring the hits \\"Um Amor de Ver√£o\\" and \\"Voc√™ se Esconde\\". The band split up in 1987, and all members went back to their successful careers as session musicians. Wander Taffo released 3 solo albums and opened a music school in S√£o Paulo, following the successful format of the American Musicians Institute. In 1993, drummer Gel Fernandes and bassist Lee Marcucci revived the band, with Marcinho Eiras on guitars. Despite extensive touring and positive feedback from fans, the new R√°dio T√°xi soon disbanded without releasing any new material. The reunion of the successful mid-80s lineup happened in 2000, when Brazilian singer and pianist Guilherme Arantes invited Taffo, Marcucci and Fernandes to play with him on a live album. After touring with Arantes, they began working on new R√°dio T√°xi material with Gasperini and released a live album and DVD, featuring all the old hits alongside the new material. Guitarist Wander Taffo died in Brazil on May 14, 2008, of a cardiorespiratory arrest.

This branch contains animals classified under the orders Cetacea and Artiodactyla. See also parent page Mammals discovered in the 2000s. Moschiola kathygre (2005) Moschiola kathygre, a new species of chevrotain, was named in 2005. The small deer can be found in the wet zones of Sri Lanka. Australian snubfin dolphin Orcaella heinsohni (2005) The Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni), is a species discovered distinct to the closely related Irrawaddy dolphin in 2005. It was the first dolphin species to be named for at least 30 years. Giant forest peccary (2004) A possible fourth species of peccary, dubbed the giant forest peccary, was discovered in Brazil in 2004. The peccary is said to be larger and behave differently to the three known species. The creature's discoverers claim to have first encountered the animal being killed and eaten by villagers. Omura's whale Balaenoptera omurai (2003) In 2003, Japanese scientists announced the discovery of a new species of rorqual, named Omura's whale (Balaenoptera omurai), after extensive studies of Bryde's whale (B. brydei). The scientists also claimed their research settled a long-standing taxonomic argument, and Bryde's whale and the pygmy Bryde's whale (B. edeni) are in fact two distinct species. Perrin's beaked whale Mesoplodon perrini (2002) Perrin's beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini) was named as a new species in 2002. It was originally found in 1975 off the coast of California, but misidentified as Hector's beaked whale (Mesoplodon hectori). It is now thought to me more closely related to the pygmy beaked whale (Mesoplodon peruvianus), which was only itself described in 1991. North Pacific right whale Eubalaena japonica (2000) In 2000, DNA testing confirmed the theory that there are three species of right whale, as the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) is a distinct species from the North Atlantic right whale (E.glacialis). Strictly speaking, this is not a newly discovered species, but simply an alternative taxonomic treatment, as japonica already was widely recognized, but \\"only\\" as a subspecies. Roosevelt's muntjac Muntiacus rooseveltorum (1999/2000) In 1999, genetic research was conducted on a mysterious specimen of muntjac found in a Laos menagerie in 1995. The unusual black deer was discovered to be Roosevelt's muntjac (Muntiacus rooseveltorum), a species previously known to science only from a single individual, discovered in 1929.

It is in The Hayes area of the southern city centre. Owing to the extension of St David's 2 in 2009, St David's is the third busiest shopping centre in the United Kingdom. The construction of the extension cost a total of ¬£675m and brought Cardiff within the top five shopping destinations in the United Kingdom. The centre consists of original the first phase, St David's Centre, adjoining St David's Hall and the second phase, given the development name of St David's 2. The second phase of the shopping centre, opened on 22 October 2009, when the first 58 of its 88 stores opened for business. History In 2008‚Äì9, the annual footfall of the centre was 27 million, and it is expected to rise to 33 million in 2009‚Äì10. 20 million people visited the centre during the first six months after the opening of St David's 2.Wales Online: St David‚Äôs brings in 20 million shoppers St David's was crowned the international shopping centre of the year in 2010 by Global Retail Leisure International, beating contenders in Portugal and Singapore.Wales Online  Cardiff‚Äôs St David‚Äôs is world‚Äôs top retail arcade St David's is patrolled by three paramedics on bicycles between every Friday and Sunday in order to respond rapidly to medical emergencies. =The first phase= St David's Shopping Centre was open to the public in January 1981, although it did not officially open until 24 March 1982. The centre has 4 entrances located on Queen Street, Cathedral Walk, Working Street and Hills Street. The entrance on Hills Street connects to the northern entrance of the second phase of the shopping centre, open at street level and via an enclosed bridge on the first floor. It is also joined internally with Queens Arcade. There are 3 thoroughfares within the centre: Town Wall, Cathedral Walk and St David's Way. The centre attracted an average footfall of 39,000,000 per annum and has a core catchment of 2.4 million people. The 12 million tourists that visit the city annually help generate over ¬£7.5 billion in retail spending. There are seventy-five individual shops and stores in the first centre that cater for a broad demographic. The centre is anchored by Boots, Debenhams, Marks & Spencer and Primark. St David's Hall was built on top of the shopping centre. =Second phase (St David's 2)= St David's, and much of the southern end of Cardiff city centre's shopping area, was re- developed as part of the St David's 2 development. The second phase was a ¬£675 million extension of the centre, in which a large part of Cardiff's south city centre was demolished. Demolished buildings included Oxford Arcade, St David's Market, St David's Link including the Cardiff Central Library, the NCP Tredegar Street multi-storey car park, the Wales National Ice Rink, the NCP Bridge Street multi-storey car park, and Toys \\"R\\" Us who relocated to Cardiff International Sports Village. The second phase of St. David's was known as St David's 2 during the construction phase, but both phases were simply named \\"St David's\\" when the second phase was completed. The second phase consists of three main buildings in total: the Central Library building, which is built on part of the Marriott Hotel car park, the John Lewis department store, which is built on the former Wales National Ice Rink, and the main shopping area, which is built on the former Oxford Arcade, St David's Link and western side of Bridge Street. It also includes apartments, called Hayes Apartments, above the main shopping centre. The second phase was made up of different sections, they were: * St David's Walk, leading to the extension of Debenhams and the Grand Arcade. * St David's Way, The original part of St David's. * Grand Arcade, connecting St David's Walk in the original centre to John Lewis. The Grand Arcade was split over two floors. The Upper Grand Arcade had other shops and stores. The Lower Grand Arcade * Eastside is the restaurant and caf√© quarter of the second phase of the centre. It is split over two levels. * Working Street, part of the fa√ßade of St David's Hall, was converted into store fronts to better blend with the facade of the Working Street entrance of St David's Centre. * The first Welsh branch of the John Lewis department store chain opened in 2009 and is the largest John Lewis store in the UK outside London. The John Lewis department store opened four weeks before the St David's Grand Arcade shopping area was opened. St David's 2 has added an extra of retail space to the city centre, in addition to the John Lewis department store, 9 other large stores, and a further 90 smaller shops in a two-tiered shopping mall have been built. It has also created 3,000 car parking spaces, new bars and restaurants plus the new Central Library and 4,500 permanent jobs. The development has included two new arcades: Grand Arcade and Hayes Arcade to reflect Cardiff's historical Victorian arcades. The project, that it set to make Cardiff one of the top five shopping destinations in the United Kingdom, topped out on 27 January 2009. Many of the retailers in the second phase of the centre are new to Cardiff, and to Wales, in particular John Lewis, Apple, Hollister, and Victoria's Secret. St David's is now one of the busiest shopping centres in the European Union, exceeding Birmingham's Bull Ring. =Cardiff Central Library= The former Central Library was located a few hundred yards north of the present building and was knocked down to make way for the St David's 2 development.

The order also contains animals once classified separately in Pinnipedia. See also parent page Mammals discovered in the 2000s. Bornean clouded leopard, Neofelis diardi (2007) Neofelis diardi is a medium-sized wild cat found on Borneo, Sumatra and the Batu Islands in the Malay Archipelago and publicised under the name Bornean clouded leopard by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on March 14, 2007. Its coat is marked with irregularly-shaped, dark-edged ovals which are said to be shaped like clouds, hence its common name. Though scientists have known of its existence since the early 19th century, it was positively identified as being a distinct species in its own right in 2006, having long been believed to be a subspecies of the mainland clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). WWF quoted Dr. Stephen O'Brien of the U.S. National Cancer Institute as saying, \\"Genetic research results clearly indicate that the clouded leopard of Borneo should be considered a separate species\\". Some journalists have pointed out, though, that this taxon is previously known as a subspecies, and claim that the WWF announcement of a new species was more designed to draw attention to its endangered status. Qinling panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis (2005) In 2005 it was announced that research had concluded that the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) population in the Qinling Mountains, China, was sufficiently different from other pandas to warrant the creation of a new subspecies, Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis. Among other differences, the Qinling panda has brown and white colouration replacing the familiar black and white fur of typical giant pandas. \\"Cat-fox\\" (2006) In 2006 pictures were published of a potential new species of carnivoran, known in the press as the cat-fox. The images were taken by a night-time camera trap set by the WWF, on the Indonesian side of Borneo. At first sight they seem to show some kind of viverrid, slightly larger than a cat, with red fur. The creature may turn out to be a new species, though some speculate it could be the exceedingly rare Hose's palm civet (Diplogale hosei). It has recently been argued that the animal on the photos may, in fact, be the poorly known Thomas' flying squirrel (Aeromys thomasi). Lowe's servaline genet, Genetta servalina lowei (2002) In 2002 Lowe's servaline genet (Genetta servalina lowei) was photographed by a camera trap in Tanzania. Its rediscovery marks the first time the viverrid had been recorded since its type specimen, a single pelt, was collected in 1932. Mellivora capensis buechneri (2000) A new subspecies of the honey badger was discovered in Turkmenistan in 2000. It is similar to the subspecies M. c. indica and M. c. inaurita, but has differences including a larger size. Civettictis civetta pauli (2000) A new subspecies of the African civet. Olinguito (2013) The olinguito, living in the Andean cloud forest, was categorized as a distinct species in 2013. It had previously been identified as a small olingo.

He was born in County Armagh in Ireland and in 1832 came to Canada with his family and his father established a farm in Etobicoke. Smith went into commerce, first working as a clerk in several Toronto stores, and then opening his own wholesalers in London, Ontario in 1849. After a few years of limited business, the arrival of the railway in London set off an economic boom and Smith prospered greatly. He expanded his business interests, including becoming the primary shareholder in the Toronto Street Railways. The Senator's residence in Toronto, seen in the 1890s. Smith made his fortune with the streetcar service generating record products by cutting costs, not replacing aged cars and requiring his employees to work 14-hour days, six days a week for $8 to $9 a week. When his workers threatened to join the Knights of Labor trade union he locked them out resulting in three days of violent protests. Mayor William Holmes Howland and the press supported the workers' right to organize but Smith refused to allow a union and criticized the city government for failing to maintain order. In the end, Smith allowed limited pay increases but refused to allow a union and fired the organizers prompting a strike and the establishment of a rival, worker run \\"Free Bus Company\\" which was soon out of business when its fleet was destroyed by fire. Smith's actions alienated the Toronto working class, particularly Catholic workers among whom he hoped to build a political base. Smith sold his share of the TSR to the city in 1881 for $500,000.Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online In 1866, he was elected mayor of London, Ontario. Originally a supporter of the Reform movement that evolved in the Liberal Party, Sir John A. Macdonald persuaded him to switch his allegiance to the Conservatives and organize support for the Tories among the Irish Catholic community. In 1871, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada as a Liberal-Conservative and served in Sir John A. Macdonald's cabinet from 1882 to 1891 as minister without portfolio. He continued in the cabinet when Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott became prime ministare and served as Minister of Public Works, and Controller of Customs (Acting) from 1891 to 1892 following the resignation of Sir Hector- Louis Langevin. Due to age and poor health he declined to continue in cabinet when Sir John Sparrow David Thompson became prime minister in 1892. Following Thompson's death in December 1892, Governor General Lord Aberdeen invited Smith to become prime minister but he declined. He agreed, however, to return to cabinet as a minister without portfolio under Mackenzie Bowell and then Sir Charles Tupper until the Conservatives were defeated in the 1896 federal election. In politics, Smith was an advocate of the rights of Irish Catholics and lobbied for the appointment of Irish Catholics to patronage positions. In 1872, he lobbied Macdonald for the gradual release of Fenian raiders who had attempted military attacks on Canadian soil in order to promote Irish independence. Smith was created a Knight Bachelor in June 1894. See also John B Mather References * *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online *Thompson, Austin Seton.

Publication history The Enclave first appeared in Fantastic Four #66 and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional organization history The organization that would eventually become known as the Enclave was founded by four scientists (each of whom was a world-class scientist in a different area of expertise) consisting of Dr. Jerome Hamilton, Maris Morlak, Professor Wladyslav Shinski, and Carlo Zota. The goal of the organization was to use advanced technology to establish a benevolent world dictatorship under the rule of the scientists. The four scientists successfully faked their own deaths and disappeared from society, founding the Citadel of Science (a.k.a. the \\"Beehive\\"); on an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, using both their own technology and abandoned Deviant technology they had found. Their operations were initially funded by their own personal fortunes, and they hired mercenaries as additional personnel as needed. The scientists began their advanced scientific research and development, achieving various scientific breakthroughs and creating many advanced inventions. Before long, their level of technology was more advanced than most known on Earth. The scientists' first major accomplishment was the creation of the superhumanly powerful humanoid being they referred to as \\"Him\\" (who would one day become known as Adam Warlock). In an attempt to \\"create a perfect race of human beings, \\"without evil - without sin\\", they created Him to be \\"the forerunner of a supreme new race\\". The scientists, who had lost control of Him, abducted Alicia Masters to sculpt his likeness as this would help them regain control in an unspecified way. Since she is blind, she would not be affected by \\"the blinding power he generates\\". She reached Him as he was about to emerge from a cocoon in his final metamorphosis. The Fantastic Four discovered the scientists' existence and came to rescue Alicia wrecking the citadel as they battle its security forces. Jerome Hamilton was killed by falling debris as a result of energy bursts that were released by the emergence of Him from the cocoon. The citadel is destroyed when Him builds up enough energy to escape.Fantastic Four #66-67 The scientists were not discouraged by their failure with Him or the death of Hamilton. So they created another superhumanly powerful humanoid they called \\"Paragon\\" (who would later become known as Her and Kismet). Although they enlisted Doctor Strange to perform brain surgery on Paragon, they lost control of her as well and she destroyed the rebuilt citadel. The scientists battled the Hulk, Doctor Strange, and Paragon before she departed.Incredible Hulk Annual #6 Taking the name the Enclave, the scientists financed Security College in New York State. The College was actually part of an information-gathering scheme, and the Enclave hired the Monocle to acquire industrial, military, and political information from students. However, the Security College operation was uncovered, and the Monocle was defeated by the Human Torch and Spider-Man. Monocle was later killed by the Enclave who abandoned the operation. Thanks to their efforts though, the Enclave learned of the Inhumans and abducted Medusa.Fantastic Four #207 The Enclave made an alliance with Maximus and successfully infiltrated Attilan as part of an attempt to conquer the Inhumans' Great Refuge. The Enclave attacked the Inhumans, but were betrayed by Maximus and defeated.Fantastic Four #240 With Maximus again, they launched an attack on Earth from Attilan in an attempt to foment war between Earth and the Inhumans. This plan failed, and they instead battled the Avengers and Inhumans. Morlak and Zota were captured and imprisoned.Avengers Annual #12 Morlak and Zota were later freed from prison by Shinski. All three were injured in an airplane crash, captured, and hospitalized.Avengers #262-263 The Enclave obtained both financial backing and an agent named Frank as an assistant from A.I.M. In exchange, they were to capture Kismet and turn her over to A.I.M. Shinski suffered a stroke and he required intravenous therapy after suffering heart and lung damage. The Enclave rebuilt their Transfer Grid in a new base somewhere in the American Midwest. Morlak and Zota traveled to Project Pegasus using the Transfer Grid to obtain a cocoon containing a healing Kismet. After removing Kismet from the cocoon, they used the cocoon to cure Shinsky. Shinsky was overjoyed to see Kismet, but Morlak and Zota planned to extract some of Kismet's DNA to give themselves superhuman powers. Morlak and Zota intended to betray A.I.M. once they gained their superpowers, but Frank assaulted them to stop their plans. Kismet stopped Frank from killing Shinsky, only for Frank to reveal that he was really an Adaptoid and took on Paragon's form and powers. As Kismet and the Adaptoid fight, Shinski infected and destroyed Paragon with a genetic virus. Kismet then made more cocoons to heal Shinski, Morlak, and Zota, and decided to stay with them to nurture them back to health.Quasar #57 Some time later, Shinkski, Morlak, and Zota were transformed into powerful superhumans just as they had hoped. Now, their advanced minds focused on helping humanity rather than conquering the world, although they differed on how to best achieve this goal. They found that they could not travel very far from each other without suffering power loss and great pain. The Enclave tested their powers through actions such as stopping a tornado, saving dying patients, bringing rain to a drought region, curing deadly jungle diseases, disposing of nuclear wastes, and revitalizing rainforests. Their actions brought about long-term effects that they were unaware of, and some places suffered even worse fates due to the Enclave's over-compensations. Although Kismet tried to stop them, their actions caused a volcano to erupt, but they averted disaster with her aid. They accepted Kismet's advice to learn more about their powers by investigating their source, and Kismet accompanied the Enclave into space. They encountered Khatylis during a battle against the Silver Surfer, and the Enclave attacked Khatylis who quickly destroyed them. Kismet caused a dangerous inter-dimensional rift by attacking Khatylis, but Khatylis healed the rift before they were all destroyed, and restored Kismet, Silver Surfer, and the Enclave.Cosmic Powers Unlimited #2 The Enclave's superhuman powers eventually faded. The Enclave later hired Tinkerer to repair their Transfer Grid in order to get their operations running again.Spider-Man: Dead Man's Hand The Enclave operated out of a building in the South Bronx where they have implanted control chips in criminals to use as drones. They also created a robot called Remote which they used to acquire technologies from other companies. While looting Micron Labs, Remote killed a security guard and his silhouette made others think that Spider-Man was responsible. Spider-Man and the Thunderbolts came to investigate, with the Thunderbolts following Remote back to the Enclave and Spider-Man following them. The Enclave completed the Transfer Grid and the Bio-Modem (a beam that would be able to control the minds of others). When the heroes arrived, the Enclave used the Bio-Modem on them. Spider-Man and MACH-I set up interference to the Bio-Modem's power which freed the others. The heroes then destroy Remote and the Enclave fled through the Transfer Grid taking the Transfer Grid and their equipment with them.Spider-Man Team-Up #7 Morlak and Shinski created a device to usurp the creative genius of Mister Fantastic to advance their efforts to bio-engineer the human race. They travel to the Tibetan monastery of the Tibetan \\"Monks of Doom\\" (the sect that had constructed Doctor Doom's armor) and slaughtered many of the monks, enslaving the rest of the monks to forge a pair of armor suits.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #12 Reporter Isabel Aguirre and photographer Gordon Clay traveled to the monastery to learn why these monks associated with Doctor Doom. They found the monks slaughtered and also find the armored Crucible.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #3 Crucible forced Aguirre and Clay on a plane and they are flown to Europe while Crucible states that he was the crucible from which would a new world would be formed.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #4 Crucible transformed them into stone gargoyles to smuggle them through immigration. In Stockholm, Sweden, Crucible restored them to life, and coerced them into serving him or risk being turned back into stone gargoyles. Crucible then attacked a science symposium to draw out Mister Fantastic. While using a decoy device disguised as a bomb to draw away the Thing, Crucible fought Reed Richards and activated a device that would drain his inventive genius and transfer it into himself before escaping.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #5 Morlak and Shinski relocate to Genosha and began using the war-torn nation to test their weapons and tactics, gathering and experimenting on the Genoshan people in hopes of transforming them into a master race. The two captured Kismet and brainwashed her into serving them. They altered her appearance and powers, and renamed her Ayesha. The Genoshan government sent Trapster to capture Mister Fantastic not knowing that Crucible had stolen Mister Fantastic's inventive genius.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #10 The remaining members of the Fantastic Four followed Mister Fantastic's kidnappers to Genosha only to be defeated by Ayesha. She brought them to Crucible who swapped their minds with that of Crucible's three Genoshan accomplices. The powerless heroes escaped from Crucible, but when one of the Genoshans tried to use Human Torch's powers it resulted in an explosion that destroyed the several top floors of a building which killed some civilians.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #11 The powerless heroes reunited with Mister Fantastic. Along with Genoshan Chief Magistrate Anderson, the four storm Crucible's base. Thing, Invisible Woman, and Human Torch fought their super-powered counterparts and reclaimed their bodies. Mister Fantastic entered the inner sanctum and discovered the Genoshans that the Enclave were experimenting on. Morlak revealed his face and confronted Mister Fantastic but Morlak became overwhelmed under the stress of the influx of ideas from Mister Fantastic's stolen inventive genius. Shinski appeared in the Crucible armor and apparently killed Morlak, who died happily released from the torment of seeing the world's fate. Shinski pronounced Morlak unworthy of claiming the cosmos and serving as Ayesha's consort, naming himself the true Crucible with Morlak as his lackey. Mister Fantastic was able to stun Crucible and flee with the rest of the repowered Fantastic Four. Crucible found Ayesha but Genoshan Chief Magistrate Anderson surprised both of them with a black hole generator creating a miniature black hole that pulled all three of them in. The Enclave (with Shinski and Morlak turning up alive) posed as the motion picture company Beehive Productions hiring a young intern named Danny to design a female \\"Warlock\\" as a movie character. They created a fail-safe program to gain better control of her. Adam Warlock apparently sensed this new developing being and uploaded a scenario into her to teach her a sense of right and wrong, which allowed her to resist the Enclave's control and escape.Warlock vol. 6 #1-4 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer Greg Pak and artist Charles Adlard Members * Dr. Jerome Hamilton - An American medical biologist. He was killed by Adam Warlock. * Maris Morlak - A Lithuanian nuclear physicist. He briefly possessed cosmic power on the same level as Kismet and the Silver Surfer.

Crucible went after Mister Fantastic in a plot to steal his inventive genius and kick-start the Enclave's genetics program. They wore identical suits of power armor, forged by the same monks who forged Doctor Doom's armor, which have the ability to transmute the shape and composition of materials. Other groups =Asmodeus-worshipping Enclave= Another, unrelated Enclave in Marvel Comics first appeared in the pages of Tomb of Dracula vol. 2 #2 in December 1979. The group consisted of Damian Burnemissza, Druig, Satas, Kirk Druker, and Sondra. This Enclave was an organization of occultists dedicated to the worship of the demon Asmodeus. They were enemies of the Dimensional Man and Dracula.Tomb of Dracula vol. 2 #2 This group was created by Marv Wolfman and Steve Ditko. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Extinction miniseries in the Ultimate Marvel universe, it was revealed that a group of scientists rented a radio telescope, applied their own algorithms to it, and were able to see a 'processional entity' (the creature known as Gah Lak Tus) which would arrive within 20 years. To fight the entity when it arrived, they hired Heather Douglas, a contract killer, cloned her, and raised the clones to be an army against Gah-Lak-Tus. The clones refer to the scientists as 'the Enclave', but it also operates as the Paragon Corporation.Ultimate Extinction #1-5 In other media =Video games= * The Enclave appears as recurring enemies in The Incredible Hulk video game. The organization is divided into four powerful sectors that are codenamed Ceres, Minerva, Vulcan, and Jupiter, with each one having their own private army, territory, and research focus. Their leaders are depicted as four mysterious scientists in full body armor, and referred to only as Ceres Leader (voiced by Simbi Khali Williams), Jupiter Leader (voiced by S. Scott Bullock), Minerva Leader (voiced by Courtenay Taylor), and Vulcan Leader (voiced by Dave Wittenberg). Vulcan Sector is the mechanical division, Ceres Sector is the Enclave's biotech division, Minerva Sector is the psych-ops branch, and Jupiter Sector researches weather manipulation. Enemies and troops consist of normal Legionnaires, Centurions, Barbaria mutant soldiers, and also laser turrets, Enclave swarms, flying dropships, and giant Kyklops robots. The Enclave test weapons and devices by indiscriminately using them on Manhattan and its citizens, and hide their activities with shielded research labs and buildings owned by their front company named the \\"Paragon\\" Corporation. Throughout the game, the Enclave launch assault groups to attack the city and put many schemes into motion for their own gain and conquest, like stealing high technology, draining life energy to power their machines, using chemical bombs to contaminate and seize territory, building a massive mind control device, unleashing powerful weapons to eliminate the Hulk, etc. After the Hulk thwarts all of their schemes, they decide that proxies are not enough to deal with the green monster and need to take the matter into their own hands, while hoping that the Army does the work for them. Bonus levels involve destroying the remaining Enclave bases and defeating their leaders. After a sector's headquarters has reached their limit, their leaders send updates that will lure Hulk where they want him, essentially challenging him. Each leader wears advanced battle armor to fly and have superhuman strength and durability, and are armed with staves that harness and project energy. Also, they each have their own special attacks. Vulcan Leader attacks with orbital satellite lasers, Ceres Leader summons Bi-Beast androids that have lesser strength than the original, Minerva Leader uses illusionary duplicates to distract Hulk while she recovers health, and Jupiter Leader will call lightning strikes.

Their debut single, \\"Kill for Cash\\", and second single, \\"Unemployed\\", were both released in 1981 on the band's own Cabbage Records label. While recording their debut album, An Adjustment to Society (produced by Ryk Oakley), they opened for the Professionals at The Channel in Boston. Former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones became friends with Kraut and recorded extra guitar tracks for three tracks on the album: \\"Kill for Cash\\", \\"Sell Out\\" and \\"Onward\\". The album was again self-released, distributed by Faulty Products. A video clip for \\"All Twisted\\" appeared in rotation on MTV, making Kraut the first independent band to be played on the station. The band released a mini-album, Whetting the Scythe, in 1984, and toured the U.S. By the mid-1980s, Kraut had added second guitarist Christopher Smith from Battalion of Saints, and developed a more hard rock/metal sound. Guitarist Holland went on to play for New York hardcore band the Cro-Mags. A Kraut reunion show with all four original members took place in 2002 at CBGB during the New York Thrash reunion, yielding the Live at CBGB's album.

She is best known however for her only film role in the Tod Browning, pre-code production Freaks in 1932. Her body was supposedly split down the middle, one side female and the other male. She claimed to be a true hermaphrodite, but there is no evidence to confirm whether this was the case or not; she may have just been a very skilled impersonator, in the style of Albert Alberta Karas. Like many sideshow \\"hermaphrodites\\" of the early 20th century, she presented a \\"half and half\\" trick: woman on the left and man on the right. One side of the body would be exercised, have hair trimmed, and tanned; the other side would be covered and un-exercised, making it pale and flabby, so the chest resembled a woman's breast while the hair was grown out. The performer would then wear a split costume: a low-cut, tight top and hotpants on the \\"female\\" side and on the \\"male\\" side a Tarzan-style loincloth. Court case Pitch photo of sideshow performer Josephine Joseph, c. 1935 In 1930, Joseph and her husband George Waas‚Äîdescribed only in newspaper reports as \\"an American couple\\"‚Äî who were presenting a Coney Island-style attraction in Blackpool under the title of \\"Josephine-Joseph\\", were prosecuted in the United Kingdom for false pretences and conspiracy on account of their \\"Half Woman-Half Man\\" circus show. Joseph claimed to be 27 years of age at the time (although in reality she was 33‚Äì34). The court alleged that the show was a fraud, and that she was not a true hermaphrodite. Waas offered to submit X-rays of Josephine to the magistrates, but refused to submit her to a court doctor's physical examination. The Superintendent in charge of the case admitted that the two sides of Josephine's body looked different, although he had \\"no idea what the medical testimony may be\\". The court descriptions of her appearance also match her costume as seen in the film Freaks. She was described as a man on the right side, and a woman on the left, with her right arm longer than her left. Her eyebrows were different. She displayed a bare right leg with a sandal, and a black-stockinged left leg with a woman's shoe. Her hair was brushed from the right side to the left, giving the impression of short hair on the right side. In order to avoid a jury trial, Joseph and Waas pleaded guilty. Waas told the court \\"I am sorry. I will give up this show and leave the country\\". Waas, who served as her manager, was fined ¬£25, whilst Josephine was acquitted. Freaks Josephine Joseph is most prominently remembered for a role in the Tod Browning 1932 classic cult film Freaks. Although she only had two lines, she still appeared in a number of scenes, most notably the scene at the wedding reception where she is the one who begins the chant: \\"We accept her, one of us! We accept her, one of us!\\". In another notable scene early in the film, \\"Josephine\\" gives an alluring look towards the strongman to which another performer responds comically \\"I think she likes you, but he don't!\\" She is later seen assembling the rest of the circus freaks for their plan of revenge by saying to them: \\"Soon, we go\\". Personal life She was married to George Waas. Much of the performer's personal life, including birth name, date of birth and death, has never been clearly established.

Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi. Accessed: 16 October 2009 \\"The Sick Rose\\" is a poem by William Blake. The poem mentions through the symbols of the rose and the worm, how intense experience preys upon unpolluted innocence. The first publication was in 1794, when it was included in his collection titled Songs of Experience as the 39th plate. The incipit of the poem is O Rose thou art sick. Blake composed the page sometime after 1789, and presents it with the illuminated border and illustrations that were typical of his self publications. Most aspects of the original production were undertaken by the author; the composition of the poem and design, engraving, and promotion of the work. The printing was usually done by Blake's wife, Catherine, as well as any colouring not performed by Blake himself.  Text  :O Rose thou art sick. :The invisible worm, :That flies in the night :In the howling storm: :Has found out thy bed :Of crimson joy: :And his dark secret love :Does thy life destroy. Analysis Nathan Cervo describes the poem as \\"One of the most baffling and enigmatic in the English language\\". The rose and worm have been considered by critics as \\"figures of humanity\\", although Michael Riffaterre doubts the direct equivalence of Man as a worm; when Blake makes this comparison in other places, Riffaterre notes, he is explicit about it. Nevertheless, the \\"lesson of the worm may be applicable to human experience\\". The rhyme scheme is ABCB. The scansion is difficult to place, due to a lack of pattern; the stanzas are asymmetrical: the first has syllables of 5,6,5,5, and the second of 5,4,6,5. Punctuation is also irregular: there is no comma [,] after \\"O Rose\\", and yet there is a comma [,] after \\"worm\\". The poem was set to music by Benjamin Britten in his 1943 Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, where it forms the movement \\"Elegy\\". More recently, British rock band Amplifier set the poem to music on their 2011 album The Octopus. Verses of the poem also comprise and inspire the 1991 song \\"Love's Secret Domain\\" by the band Coil.

Geography It is situated on the Teltow plateau, about southwest of the Berlin city centre, and east of Potsdam. Neighbouring municipalities are the town of Teltow in the east and Kleinmachnow in the north, both immediately bordering the Berlin city limits. The municipal area is bound by the Teltow Canal in the north. It comprises Stahnsdorf proper and the villages of G√ºterfelde, Schenkenhorst, and Sputendorf. History Stahnsdorf in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was first documented in a 1264 purchase contract of Margrave Otto III and the Brandenburg bishop. It originally consisted only of its old village green on a formerly important merchant road from Leipzig in Saxony via G√ºterfelde and Stahnsdorf, crossing the B√§ke creek (the present-day Teltow Canal) at Kleinmachnow, and running northwards to Spandau. With the construction of the Teltow Canal in the early 20th century, the opening of the large Southwest Cemetery in April 1909, the Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof and Friedenauer Waldfriedhof in 1913, and the opening of the S-Bahn route from Berlin-Wannsee station in June 1913 the development in a Berlin suburb began. In the following decades, the current site was created by the development of privately owned homes, the connection to Berlin-Lichterfelde by a tram and building a settlement for workers at the Bosch manufactures in Kleinmachnow. In 1920 the Stahnsdorf Military Cemetery was formalised. It contains 1175 graves, mainly of British POWs who died in captivity.https://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/90900/berlin-south- western-cemetery/ It was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer 1931 Stahnsdorf WWTP was put into operation, where waste water from the south of Berlin was treated. It was one of the first plants to produce biogas. The construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 severed the connections to the bordering Berlin. In the communist era, the place was dominated economically, especially through the semiconductor business as a major operation and farms. The fall of the Berlin Wall set a renewing development by inflows, opening new home communities, and in recent years by commercial development, particularly in \\"Green Park\\", a large industrial park.

Functioning as one of the city's retail malls, The building is built on the site of the former Capitol Theatre, and is situated at the eastern end of Queen Street near the Dumfries Place bus terminus and Cardiff Queen Street railway station. It was anchored by a large H&M; store, with the front of the centre being dominated by Tesco since Virgin Megastores and Zavvi ceased operations in 2009. History Inside the Capitol Centre Opened in 1990, the centre was originally built to mimic Victorian architecture which was a very popular style of design during the late 1980s and early 1990s for shopping centres; but the centre was also inspired by many of Cardiff's late 19th century Victorian arcades (much like Queens Arcade which opened in 1994 and more recently the new St. Davids centre expansion). This style of build dated very quickly and, in 1999, the centre underwent a ¬£10 million redevelopment, which included the refurbishment of the pedestrian areas, the removal of the food court and new entrances into the centre (although much of the original external facade still remains). It was completed in November 1999. In 2012, three years after the St Davids 2 Development. Fears for the centre as most of its stores also has sister stores at St Davids, and that the centre would lose its popularity. In 2016 Captol announced its new owner NewRiver Retail which plans to take on the centre. Cinema The centre had originally also housed a five-screen Odeon cinema up until 2001, it has reopened in April 2015 operated by Premiere Cinemas.http://cardiff.premierecinemas.co.uk/PremiereCinemasCardiff.dll/Page?PageID=0 Future developments There were plans to develop 164 apartments, plus retail and commercial space and additional car parking facilities at the corner of North Edward Street and Station Terrace. This would provide 50 per cent additional spaces, bringing the total car parking spaces up to 632. The scheme architects, Dobson Architects, expected it could be completed by 2012, but this never happened. The opening of the extended St David's Shopping Centre and Council changes to road access has had a significant effect on footfall within the centre and been a major driver for the redevelopment of the shopping centre. In additions to the changes above, the redevelopment will include the complete redesign of the first floor shopping space, relocation of the existing tenants and the arrival of a major tenant to occupy the majority of the newly created space.

Kamiya's third book, Works of Satoshi Kamiya 2, 2002-2009, released in 2012, includes 16 models and is a follow-up to his debut. Although most of these were previously published in convention books and magazines, it also includes new, previously unpublished diagrams for the famous feathered, long-tailed phoenix. In June 2019, Kamiya released a third volume of his designs.

The following are some of the key arguments of the dissertation: * In 1938, Lyndon B. Johnson, then a Congressman and later the 36th President of the United States of America, worked covertly to establish a refuge in Texas for European Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. Johnson helped hundreds of European Jews enter Texas through Cuba, Mexico and South America. * In part, Johnson was influenced in his attitude towards the Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather (Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr.), who was a member of the Christadelphian church, shared with him. Christadelphians believe that the Jews are God's chosen people, and LBJ's grandfather once said to him, \\"Take care of the Jews, God‚Äôs chosen people. Consider them your friends and help them any way you can.\\" Various details of Gomolak's dissertation have been cited by other historians. In 2008, Larry Ben David began an online campaign to collect documentation to submit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem, Israel to have LBJ awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations, often referred to as a Righteous Gentile. Additional primary research on Operation Texas was done for a 1998 Houston Chronicle article and a 2016 article on the aish.com website. More recently, many of the arguments of Gomolak's thesis have been disputed following extensive research by Claudia Wilson Anderson, an archivist at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. Although his research materials (e.g., written interview notes, interview recordings and primary documents not located in archives) could support his arguments, Gomolak has not made them available for external review.

History James Joyce's and partner's room within the tower View from James Joyce Tower The tower was leased from the War Office by Joyce's university friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, with the purpose of \\"Hellenising\\" Ireland. Joyce stayed there for six days, from September 9 to 14 in 1904. Gogarty later attributed Joyce's abrupt departure to a midnight incident with a loaded revolver.Gogarty, Oliver (1948). Mourning Became Mrs. Spendlove. New York: Creative Age Press. pp. 56‚Äì57. The opening scenes of Ulysses are set the morning after this incident. Gogarty is immortalised as \\"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan\\" (the opening words of the novel). The tower now contains a museum dedicated to Joyce and displays some of his possessions and other ephemera associated with Ulysses (e.g., an empty pot of \\"Plumtree's Potted Meat\\"). The living space is set up to resemble its 1904 appearance, and contains a ceramic panther to represent one seen in a dream by a resident. It is a place of pilgrimage for Joyce enthusiasts, especially on Bloomsday. The Tower became a museum opening on 16 June 1962 through the efforts of Dublin artist John Ryan. Ryan also rescued the front door to 7 Eccles Street (now at the James Joyce Centre) from demolition and organised, with Brian O'Nolan, the first Bloomsday Celebration in 1954. The James Joyce Tower is open 365 days a year, 10am-6pm (10am-4pm in Winter). Admission is free, but donations are needed for upkeep.

UTIOG have performed on Last Call with Carson Daly and Jimmy Kimmel Live! as well as opening for acts such as Aerosmith, Darrell DMC, Crowded House, Angels and Airwaves and The Sounds. History Aaron Bruno and Drew Stewart formed a band called Home Town Hero and signed to the now defunct Maverick Records from 2002-2004. In 2004, after several member changes and label woes, the band went on hiatus. Around this time, Bruno and Stewart reconnected with childhood friend and former Audiovent drummer Jamin Wilcox and began to play music together. All three had experienced turmoil with major record labels and wanted to create music on their own terms. The music from these sessions would later be recorded and released free over the internet under the album title Bitch City. While the band was still called HomeTown Hero at this point, they felt the evolution of the music did not fit the name so they dropped the name. Since HomeTown Hero was still contractually obligated to Maverick, the label held the legal rights to HomeTown Hero's music. The members of the band quit the label, forced to leave their music behind. The band continued under the name \\"Under the Influence of Giants\\", a name meant to reflect of their continuous struggle to operate free of authority. They recruited keyboardist Katie Logan and bassist David Amezuca and began to play shows in the Los Angeles area in mid-2005, selling out venues like the Roxy and Key Club several times. In the spring of 2006, after a short West Coast tour, Logan decided to amicably leave the band and created the duo Katie and Katie with a friend. In the winter of 2005 they signed with Island Records. They released their debut in summer of 2006 on Island Records. In November 2006, they headlined the halftime show at Major League Soccer's MLS Cup championship game at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, Texas. They have headlined and sold out numerous club tours in the US and UK. They have also gone on tour in the UK and Europe with The Sounds, as well as opening for them on select dates in the United States. Aaron Bruno is currently in the band Awolnation, and David Amezcua as well as Drew Stewart were in the band until each left. They released their debut EP Back from Earth in 2010 on iTunes. Jamin Wilcox has released a solo album on iTunes. David Amezcua is currently in the band Hotstreets, who released their self-titled debut album in 2010 on iTunes.

SITI was founded in 1992 by American director Anne Bogart and Japanese director Tadashi Suzuki to redefine and revitalize contemporary theater in the United States; they have emphasized international cultural exchange and collaboration. Originally envisioned as a summer institute in Saratoga Springs, New York, SITI has expanded to encompass a year-round program based in New York City, with a summer season in Saratoga. The company believes that contemporary American theater must incorporate artists from around the world and learn from a cross-cultural exchange of dance, music, art, and performance experiences. Description SITI is noted for combining the Viewpoints process of Anne Bogart with the Suzuki Method of Actor Training of Tadashi Suzuki. Both techniques are alternatives to the Stanislavski-based Method training which has dominated American stage and screen for generations. Actors in the company regularly train together, and use the training as part of their rehearsal and warm-up process. In addition to the year-round program in New York City and the summer institute, SITI teaches both the Viewpoints and the Suzuki Method in residencies and masterclasses at colleges and universities across the United States. In creating and touring productions, SITI has developed relationships with theaters and arts centers in both the United States and abroad.

Striking a deal with a local fly-by-night record company, Third World Recordings, they recorded their debut album in one day, recording a dozen tunes written by Dot. Upon the first original pressing, 900 of the original 1,000 copies of the album vanished out of the warehouse, and shortly thereafter the record company's producer/president also vanished and the label quickly folded. Despite the setback, music collectors quickly got a hold of the remaining copies and word of mouth started, with those who liked it giving almost universal praise, but with many others complaining of the sloppy, almost nonsensical way the arrangements were made as well as the singing. Some claimed this was done intentionally at the urging of their father (a rumor that persisted for many years, although he denied it, and the notion would further be disputed when the tracks from the band's 1975 recording session, which showed much more polished and professional-sounding musicianship, resurfaced in 1982). The Wiggin sisters themselves have expressed dismay with the finished product, noting that several of the quirks in the musicianship were in fact rhythm mistakes that were left in; this was a factor in the band's breakup and their reluctance to reunite in the wake of their newfound success. By the mid-1970s WBCN, a local radio station in Boston, Massachusetts, began playing a few cuts from the record, helping to bring the group and the record belated fame. It became further known in 1978 when famed independent music band NRBQ listened in, sought out a copy, then had it re- released in 1980 on the Red Rooster Records/Rounder Records label. Later, Dr. Demento, an American radio broadcaster and record collector specializing in novelty songs, comedy, and strange or unusual recordings, began to play the album almost exclusively on his radio show nationwide, especially around the holiday Halloween when he would play the album track \\"It's Halloween\\", and for many years since it became part of his top \\"Funny Five\\" recordings of the week. The Wiggin sisters have consistently expressed confusion and surprise in regard to why their music had become so popular, noting that the work was largely an accident. Other versions Later a CD version of the album, which also contained their follow-up album Shaggs' Own Thing was released in 1988 by Rounder, and another CD of just the original first album was released by RCA Victor in 1999. Light In The Attic Records reissued the album on vinyl, and in September 2016 issued a 180g three-color vinyl edition, which was limited to 500 copies, and included a booklet with rare photos and an extensive background essay on the history of the band and the recording of the album. The title song appears as the first track on the first volume of Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music. Reception \\"Philosophy of the World is the sickest, most stunningly awful wonderful record I've heard in ages: the perfect mental purgative for doldrums of any kind,\\" wrote Debra Rae Cohen for Rolling Stone in a review of the 1980 reissue. \\"Like a lobotomized Trapp Family Singers, the Shaggs warble earnest greeting-card lyrics (...) in happy, hapless quasi-unison along ostensible lines of melody while strumming their tinny guitars like someone worrying a zipper. The drummer pounds gamely to the call of a different muse, as if she had to guess which song they were playing - and missed every time.\\" \\"Without exaggeration,\\" Chris Connelly wrote in a later Rolling Stone article, \\"it may stand as the worst album ever recorded.\\" In an article for The New Yorker, the album was described as \\"hauntingly bad\\". Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain listed Philosophy of the World as his fifth favorite album of all time. The record has also been cited as highly influential by Frank Zappa, Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches, and Deerhoof. The album is ranked number 100 in Blender (magazine)'s 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever . In 2010, it was included in NME's \\"The 100 Greatest Albums You've Never Heard\\" list.. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked the album at 17 on its list of \\"40 Greatest One-Album Wonders\\".

The primary prayer of all Catholics is the Eucharistic liturgy in which they celebrate and share their faith together, in accord with Jesus' instruction: \\"Do this in memory of me.\\" The Catholic bishops at the Second Vatican Council decreed that \\"devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.\\" Number 13. In accord with this, many additional forms of prayer have developed over the centuries as means of animating one's personal Christian life, at times in gatherings with others. Each of the religious orders and congregations of the Catholic church, as well as lay groupings, has specifics to its own spirituality ‚Äì its way of approaching God in prayer to foster its way of living out the Gospel.  Catholic devotional piety  Catholic piety takes its inspiration from the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. Most fundamentally, Jesus prayed to God the Father, in the Holy Spirit, and recommended that we do the same. In the Gospels his prayer starts with \\"Father\\" and the prayer he taught his disciples begins with the words \\"Our Father\\". From this the Catholic Church has developed a piety that for the most part mirrors Jesus's attitude. The prayers of the Mass, the public prayer of the Church, are characteristically addressed to God the Father. The Catholic bishops declared in 1963: \\"Devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.\\" In the Catholic Church, the laity are encouraged to pray daily the canonical hours contained in the Liturgy of the Hours, which are done at seven fixed prayer times. Clergy and religious are obligated to pray the Daily Office. Sources commonly used to pray the Liturgy of the Hours include the full four volume set of The Liturgy of the Hours, the one volume Christian Prayer book, and various apps on mobile devices.  Desert spirituality  Desert spirituality is a way of seeking God that is characterized by the \\"desert theology\\" of the Old Testament that remains central to the Judeo-Christian tradition, namely God keeping his people wandering for 40 years in the desert and in subsequent centuries calling them into the desert as a testing ground, where they may experience a change of heart and, by proving themselves obedient to his ordering of human living, again accept him their Creator as also their Lord. In New Testament times it is likewise for the reason of discerning God's will and proving his obedience that Jesus of Nazareth retired to the desert after his vocation call (cf. , , ). The Christian eremitic vocation has the same purpose, as the name hermit applied to those that embrace it indicates. Among those most widely known for living a desert spirituality during the early Christian centuries is St Anthony of Egypt (251-356). He lived as a hermit for ten years, practiced asceticism for his whole life, and grew his own food for sustenance. From the life of someone alone being dedicated to seeking God in the desert, which is the earliest form of Christian monasticism, the monastic life in community has emerged, although the eremitic vocation continues as a distinct way of seeking God even today. In practical terms this spiritual quest is pursued through prayer in solitude and asceticism. Some adherents of desert spirituality ‚Äì whether as eremitic or cenobitic monastics, or as Christian faithful outside the religious life ‚Äì practise centering prayer. One form of this prayer has one meditate on a single, sacred word to draw the believer closer to God by withdrawing compulsive infatuation with particular sensory objects and conceptual constructions. This practice was prominent in Catholic practice (at least) as early as the 13th century, as evinced by works such as The Cloud of Unknowing ‚Äì written anonymously in Middle English by a Catholic monastic. Monastic orders = Benedictine spirituality = Benedictine spirituality is characterized by striving towards Christian perfection in community, liturgical prayer, and separation from worldly concerns. St. Benedict (480-550) is considered to be the Father of Western Monasticism. He wrote The Rule and established his first monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy. Lectio Divina is a Benedictine prayer form based on praying with the Word of God. Lectio Divina has four \\"moments\\": Lectio (Reading Scripture), Meditatio (Reflection on the Word), Oratio (Praying), and Contemplatio (Silently listening to God). As practiced today it includes coming together several times daily to sing God's praises, so that gratitude to God might fill all one's work. Key people involved in the 20th and 21st century include Thomas Merton and Basil Pennington. = Franciscan spirituality = Franciscan spirituality is characterized by a life of poverty, love of nature, and charitable deeds towards those in need. St. Francis of Assisi (1182‚Äì1226) was the son of a wealthy merchant. He rejected all of his possessions and founded a community of brothers (friars) who lived in poverty and served the poor. Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation, as expressed in St. Francis' Canticle of the Sun. Franciscan spirituality is focused on walking in Christ's footsteps and sharing one's experience of God. = Dominican spirituality = Dominican spirituality is characterized by poverty, preaching God's Word, and defense of Catholic doctrine. St. Dominic (1170‚Äì1221) encountered heretics on a journey in France. His opinion was that the people were not to blame, the preachers were. If there are good, orthodox preachers, then the people will be good and orthodox also. And so he founded the \\"Order of Preachers\\" or \\"Dominicans\\", who draw their inspiration from contemplating Christ's humanity. One of the ways of praying that goes back to the Dominicans is the Rosary. Legend has it that Mary herself gave the Rosary to Dominic. The Rosary is characteristic of Dominican spirituality because it focuses attention on the principal mysteries of the life of Jesus Christ, can lead to contemplation, and is a way of proclaiming the truths of faith. Some members of the Dominican Order have made significant contributions to Catholic thought as did St. Thomas Aquinas, the most prominent scholar in the Scholastic tradition. He argued that teaching the faith was a superior form of contemplative prayer. = Ignatian spirituality = Ignatian spirituality is characterized by examination of one's life, discerning the will of God, finding God in all things (hence their motto \\"Ad maiorem Dei gloriam\\" or \\"For the Greater Glory of God\\"), and living the Resurrection. St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491‚Äì1556) was a wounded soldier when he first began to read about Christ and the saints. He had a conversion experience while healing which led over time to his founding the Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuits. His classic, the Spiritual Exercises, is a guide for making a retreats, for which he is the Church's patron. Jesuits are quite diverse, despite rumors to the contrary, but are united by a zeal that comes from every Jesuit making the Spiritual Exercises. Lay Catholics make a shortened version of the Exercises at retreat houses wherein the director, as did Ignatius, guides each retreatant separately through reflections and \\"application of the senses\\" to Jesus' life, for discernment as to what God is asking of them. Ignatian Spirituality incorporates elements from earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has roots in the Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability is the extent to which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord. = Carmelite spirituality = Carmelite spirituality is characterised by interior detachment, silence, solitude, the desire for spiritual progress, and insight into mystical experiences. The roots of the Carmelite Order go back to a group of hermits living on Mt. Carmel in Israel during the 12th Century. Saints John of the Cross (1542‚Äì1591) and Teresa of √Åvila (1515‚Äì1582) were Carmelite mystics whose writings are spiritual classics. In Ascent of Mount Carmel John of the Cross teaches that purgation of the soul through mortification and suppression of desires is necessary for the transition through darkness to divine union with God. Teresa of Avila emphasized the importance of mental prayer which she defined as \\"spending time with a friend whom we know loves us.\\" Other important figures in Carmelite Spirituality include Th√©r√®se of Lisieux (Doctor of the Church), Mary Magdalene de Pazzi, Sister L√∫cia of F√°tima, Nuno of Saint Mary, Elizabeth of the Trinity, Marie-Antoinette de Geuser known as \\"Consumata\\", Edith Stein, Teresa of Los Andes, Teresa Margaret of the Sacred Heart, Joaquina de Vedruna, Angelus of Jerusalem, and Brother Lawrence. = Redemptorist spirituality = Redemptorist spirituality consists of the Crib, the Cross, and the Sacrament. In other words, the Redemptorists follow Christ in his incarnation, death, and resurrection and believe that he is always with them. They emphasize the encounter with Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, and have their founder's popular version of the Way of the Cross and the Christmas carols which he composed. With a practical focus, Redemptorist spirituality would render help to the those in dire spiritual or material need, based on Jesus' invitation to follow him. One of the most tangible ways they do this is to proclaim the Gospel in simple ways to ordinary people, taking as their motto Jesus' words when he quoted Isaiah: ‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me‚Ä¶. to preach Good News to the poor,‚Ä¶ liberty to captives,‚Ä¶ sight to the blind,‚Ä¶ to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour (Luke 4:18-19). =Servite spirituality= The spirituality of the Servite order is focused on contemplating Mary at the foot of the cross as a model for Christian life and service to the suffering. Moreover, because the order has Seven Holy Founders rather than one individual founder, there is a particular emphasis on the communal aspect of Christian life. This spirituality finds expression particularly in the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows. =Montfortian spirituality= God Alone was the motto of Saint Louis de Montfort and is repeated over 150 times in his writings. God Alone is also the title of his collected writings. Briefly speaking, based on his writings, Montfortian spirituality can be summed up by the formula: \\"To God Alone, by Christ Wisdom, in the Spirit, in communion with Mary, for the reign of God.\\" Although St Louis is perhaps best known for his Mariology and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, his spirituality is founded on the mystery of the Incarnation and is centered on Christ, as is clear in his famous Prayer to Jesus.  Post- Vatican II lay movements  :See also Laity in the Catholic Church The Second Vatican Council popularized spiritual movements among Catholics, and some lay Catholics now engage in regular contemplative practices such as the Rosary or Lectio Divina. Consistent with Vatican II, contemporary spiritual movements usually emphasize the necessity both of an interior relationship with God (private prayer) and works of justice and charity. Major 20th century writers who sought to draw together the contemplative and active poles of Christian spirituality have been Dorothy Day and Richard Rohr. The purpose of all lay movements in the Catholic Church is to spread in society a deep awareness that every person is called by Baptism to live be a holy life and each in his own way to become an ambassador of Christ, For the majority of Christians, God calls them to sanctify through their ordinary lives by an ever-growing charity in the way they think, speak, and act, beginning at home, the domestic church, but extending to the local Christian community, the workplace, and to all peoples, all God's children. = Christian Life Community = The Christian Life Community (CLC) is an international association of lay Christians who have adopted an Ignatian model of spiritual life. The 'Community' is present in almost sixty countries. The CLC traces its foundation to 1563, when the Jesuit John Leunis gathered a group of lay students at the Roman College to form the Sodality of Our Lady. The Sodality grew and was confirmed by Pope Gregory XIII in 1584. When the Second Vatican Council urged groups like the Sodality to rediscover their original roots, some sodalities continued as before, while others became Christian Life Communities. The main difference is in the size (6 to 12) and the regularity of meeting (weekly or biweekly). The CLC draws its inspiration from the teachings of St. Ignatius of Loyola, and receives spiritual guidance from the Jesuits. The experience of making the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius is of paramount importance to the members of the CLC. Members are encouraged to adhere to a lifestyle which is gospel- based and simple, to serve the poor and to integrate contemplation and action. As Ignatian spirituality has an essential apostolic dimension, members of the CLC do reflect also on how to bring Gospel values into all aspects of life in today's world. = Charismatic spirituality = Charismatic spirituality reflects a belief that the spiritual gifts present in the early Christian communities are still available to the Church today. More active sharing of spiritual experiences in community characterizes this spirituality. = Schoenstatt Movement = Schoenstatt emphasizes a strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, upholding her as a perfect example of love and purity. Schoenstatt seeks to invite the Blessed Mother (and hence her divine Son, Jesus Christ) into the home by establishing a spiritual Covenant of Love with her. It encourages its members to have the faith and purity of children, and to think of Mary as their mother. = Focolare Movement = In 1943 in northern Italy during World War II, Chiara Lubich, together with a small group of friends, concluded that God is the only ideal worth living for. The Focolare movement was founded as a result. The goal was to strive towards the fulfillment of Jesus‚Äô prayer to the Father: ‚ÄúThat they all may be one‚Äù (John 17:21). A spirituality of unity resulted and gave rise to a movement of spiritual and social renewal. Now embracing over 5 million members in 182 countries, Focolare (which means hearth) draws together groups of families, neighbors, and friends to build community and to extend the works of the Gospel. = Sant'Egidio Movement = The Sant'Egidio community began with a group of high school students in the 1960s who were convinced by a local priest in Rome to try an experiment: live for a time as the early Christian disciples did, gathering for prayer and shared meals daily in their neighborhood as well as joining together in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The community thrived and has now become a global movement of communities working for peace and justice, strengthened by daily life in common and prayer. = Opus Dei spirituality = Opus Dei predated the Second Vatican Council in its emphasis on the laity. Founded by St. Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, Opus Dei's spirituality is based on life in the secular world. The \\"sanctification of work\\" consists in offering all work, however ordinary, to God. This implies that one always does one's best. To be a contemplative is to integrate one's life (\\"unity of life\\") in faithfulness to the Catholic Church and in solidarity with all those with whom one comes into contact, living a life of faith in all circumstances of each day. As John Allen says: people who follow this spirituality enter a church and leave it for the same reason ‚Äì to get closer to God. The members of Opus Dei and its cooperators have committed to convert their daily work into prayer. Pope John Paul I, a few years before his election, wrote that Escriv√° was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escriv√° \\"it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity,\\" thus providing a comprehensive lay spirituality.prayer with the spiritual assistance of the prelature. Expressed this way, Opus Dei builds on \\"finding God in all things\\" from Ignatian spirituality and emphasizes the universality of this path to holiness. = Regnum Christi spirituality = Regnum Christi focuses on the mission of every baptized person to evangelize. Each member is called to pray, meet in community, and do some form of apostolate (which varies from member to member). Their motto is \\"Love Christ, Serve People, Build the Church.\\" They express their ethos as loving Christ, Mary, Souls, the Church, and the Pope. Regnum Christi is somewhat unusual among the lay movements as it is bound to a religious community, the Legion of Christ.

He participated in three Olympics (Montreal, Moscow, and Los Angeles) and was an Olympic medalist. He was well known in judo circles and was close friends with world-famous Japanese judo champion Yasuhiro Yamashita. He was a member of the NYC 2012 Olympic Bid Committee.  Biography  Radomir Kovaƒçeviƒá was born in Drvar, Bosnia on March 20, 1954. His father was a World War II veteran. Kovaƒçeviƒá grew up in and began practicing sports in Drvar. He started Track and Field in 1967, at the age of thirteen. By age fifteen he tried basketball, but said \\"I was very angry because regardless of how good I was, my opponent always scored.\\" The very next year Kovaƒçeviƒá became a wrestler in the Greco-Roman style in which one is only allowed to use the upper half of his body. In one year, he became champion of Yugoslavia, which was quite an accomplishment, considering that Yugoslavia was a world powerhouse in wrestling, at the time. In the summer of 1971, after wrestling practice, Kovaƒçeviƒá had decided to change sports yet again, when he saw small Japanese man \\"throwing people like paper airplanes\\", as he put it, at a local Judo club. The same day he resigned from his wrestling club and joined the judo club. After training for six months at that club he managed to throw the Japanese on one knee. On the spot, the Japanese offered to send him to Japan to study judo. Two days later, he was flown off to Japan, where he enrolled in Tokai University and continued to practice Judo. He competed for the college and on his fourth year became captain of the judo team. He was one of the few foreigners to become captain of a Japanese judo team. During his time in Japan he also gained interest in Eastern religion and philosophy. He achieved many victories at Judo competitions. Eventually, in 1980, he became a bronze-medalist at the Moscow Olympics. He used to be a coach at The Dwight School in Manhattan and trained many champions in various sports including wrestling, tennis, basketball, and sailing, among others. Since the late 1990s Radomir Kovaƒçeviƒá held a three-to- four-hour-long Judo class on Saturdays at the Spartak Judo Club, in Forest Hills. Despite the fact that the classes were usually between three and seven people full they were effective in building and attracting champion judo players. On June 15, 2006, after eighteen months of fighting cancer Kovaƒçeviƒá died in Belgrade. He was cremated and his ashes were divided into two urns. One stayed in Belgrade while the other one was taken to T≈çkai University in Tokyo.  The Radomir Workout  \\"The Radomir Workout\\" was a series of physical and mental exercises developed by Radomir Kovaƒçeviƒá which was usually between one and five hours long. It was created in 1987 when a young girl, Danielle Brennan, and her family came to him for help. He was given the task of helping her become a better sailor. Eventually she became a world champion after more than a year with Kovaƒçeviƒá.Danielle Brennan world sailing champion He even commented that they both \\"spoke the same language: the language of success and giving yourself to something.\\" After he succeeded in helping her with his 'Radomir Workout', others followed: basketball players, tennis players, wrestlers,boxers , martial artists , etc. Everyone who was willing to push himself beyond the limits and achieve higher levels came to him for help, and he would always say \\"I am here to help\\". He said, > \\"The rules of the program were very simple. The kids have to be on time; > they have to shut up, and they have to do their best. I will allow > questions; I will tell them jokes; I will push them to work very hard; I > will confuse them; I will try to make them physically, mentally, and > spiritually tough.\\"  Humanitarian Approach to Teaching  While training in Japan, Kovaƒçeviƒá developed what he called The Humanitarian Approach to Teaching. This method was developed while attending classes at T≈çkai University in Tokyo. He always disagreed with modern methods of testing because people can pass a test without learning or even studying for it, thus cheating themselves and cheating society. > \\"Tests can't tell you what kind of person a student is. Teachers should > teach students how everything works; they should treat the student as a > child to whom they would like to reveal the secrets of life, and they should > judge the child based on his effort, his attitude, his smile, his > willingness to cooperate. This is the humanitarian approach to teaching.\\"  Connections With Eastern Philosophy  Kovaƒçeviƒá's own philosophy was influenced by Eastern Religions and Philosophies. He said that while in Japan, he noticed that people behaved extremely religiously; towards the people around them, towards nature, toward work. During his stay in Japan Kovaƒçeviƒá would religiously run up 256 steps up to a certain temple. There, at 5:30 every morning, he would see an old man who turned to the east and performed a breathing exercise. The moment the sun came out he would clap his hands and bow to it. One day he decided to ask the old man why he does this, and the old man replied that the ultimate power is the sun; if sun ended, so would we. This affected Kovaƒçeviƒá greatly. \\"For religion like this,\\" he said, \\"You don't need to build a temple or go to war, and that is why I respect eastern religion.\\"  Judo Style  Kovaƒçeviƒá's judo style was based on strict correctness and traditional judo technique as it was practiced in the East. He disfavored the Western styles because they \\"changed something that is supposed to be beautiful and graceful into something ugly and primitive that can only be used to win; not to show one's skill.\\" Judo, according to his philosophy, is an art and can be associated with music and dance. In most of his classes he would play tapes of classical music to give his students rhythm. Because in Judo the way one moves and walks is based on the rhythm of his opponent and the rhythm in his head. He once said that when both competitors move against each other and try to impose their rhythms on each other they look like two rams pushing each other with their horns; but when both competitors move fluidly and one of them throws seemingly with ease that's when there is harmony.

It presents summer performances of classical music, jazz, pop and rock, country, comedy, dance, opera, as well as a Wine & Food Festival. It opened on July 9, 1966, with a presentation of George Balanchine's A Midsummer Night's Dream by the New York City Ballet. The Center is the official summer home of the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra, both of which are in residence for two or three weeks during the summer. SPAC also serves as the common venue for high school graduations, particularly for Saratoga Springs, Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake, Shenendehowa, and Ballston Spa High Schools. Saratoga Performing Arts Center, inc, is a non-profit charitable corporation that runs the arts center. It holds a 50-year renewable lease with the State of New York, which owns the land, theaters and buildings that comprise the center. SPAC subcontracts with Live Nation, which organizes and presents the popular music and rock concerts every summer. The income derived from the Live Nation contract goes towards supporting the classical arts presentations. History In early February 1961, Albany newspaperman Duane La Fleche noted a wire service report about a group hoping to entice the New York Philharmonic to make Stowe, Vermont its summer residence. La Fleche proposed that the group stay in New York State and perform in Saratoga Springs. Local civic, cultural, and legislative leaders, who had previously considered a Saratoga Arts Center an interesting possibility, began to design the facility. Within a week, they held their first meeting; within a month they were focusing on Saratoga Spa State Park as the site, had won the support of State Conservation Commissioner Harold Wilm, and began discussions with both the New York Philharmonic and New York City Ballet. By summer 1963, contributions from Rockefeller Brothers Fund and New York State supplemented community support to create Saratoga Performing Arts Center. In June 1964, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller mounted a bulldozer to break the first yard of ground. More than 410 workdays followed: 300 workers clocked 136,000 hours to complete the 5,103-seat, 10-story amphitheater (original layout of the venue did not include a festival lawn; the lawn, which holds 20,000, was added later). Harry Belafonte was the first non-classical performer to perform at SPAC, in 1967. Then on September 1, 1968 The Doors gave a performance at SPAC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-HIfr29fk which began a tradition of bringing top pop and rock acts to the amphitheater including Jackson Browne (who recorded \\"Rosie\\" backstage in 1977), Whitney Houston (who filmed her televised MTV VMA performance of \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\", as well as the official music video for \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\" on stage in 1987).

The Philadelphia Orchestra's most well-attended performance is its annual Tchaikovsky Spectacular, which includes the 1812 Overture and one or two well-known concerts. A feature of each summer is the Jazz Festival, which presents major and emerging jazz artists on two stages. The Saratoga Chamber Music Festival, under the direction of Canadian violinist, Chantal Juillet, presents programs in the Spa Little Theatre. In 2006, the composer-in-residence was Bright Sheng. Opera performances are given by the Opera Saratoga (formerly Lake George Opera). The Martha Graham Dance Company performed at SPAC during its 2008 residency at Skidmore College. SPAC is also a venue for non-classical concerts, which are booked exclusively by Live Nation, a leading concert promotion company in America. Acts such as Cardi B, Imagine Dragons and Legend Jennifer Lopez have performed at the Center. Popular rock band Phish has played the venue 20 times beginning in 1992.

This is the first novel to feature recurring character, detective John Corey. Plum Island is followed by the 2000 novel, The Lion's Game. Plot In 1997, NYPD detective John Corey is on the back porch of his uncle's waterfront home on the North Fork of Long Island recovering from three gunshot wounds while working in his town of Manhattan, NY. He enjoys the fact that the tourist season is just about over so that it's just him and the locals. He listens to music while sitting in a chair and using binoculars to spy on people in a distant boat who are enjoying themselves. The local police chief, Sylvester Maxwell, comes to the back porch and asks Corey to act as consultant in a local murder investigation, as Corey is personally acquainted with the two victims, Tom and Judy Gordon, both employees on the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, a facility suspected of carrying out biological warfare research. They go to the house the victims owned, a waterfront property that appears to have been robbed or searched, and where the two victims have been shot in the head on their own dock. Corey concludes that the victims were near their killer because it is hard to hit a person in the head with one shot at such a range. They cannot find the bullet shells, but by the direction of the wounds conclude that the bullets are in the bay. Max is unhappy because although he's not a homicide detective, his expectations of Corey's findings were high. Beth Penrose, the Suffolk County police dete, arrives. Corey instantly figures out she's in charge of the case without her stating it. She yells at him a bit for being on the crime scene because he appears to be a civilian. He ignores Beth and searches the speed boat that the Gordons temporary docked. When he gets out of the boat she pulls his own gun on him and makes him state who he is. Just before he goes, he asks if they found the chest in the boat that the Gordons used as a trunk while boating; they reply that it's missing. Corey goes to the local bar and orders junk food. He is watching the game as Beth comes in. She invites him to come back to the Gordon house with her to see the government agents involved. They return to the crime scene and go into the kitchen, where they meet George Foster, an FBI agent, and Ted Nash, who claims to represent the Department of Agriculture but whom Corey immediately recognises as a CIA agent due to being at a crime scene at the late hour. They discuss theories of the deaths, such as the Gordons trading the deadly diseases to which they have access for money and using the boat chest as a container for the items. The TV shows news coverage of the murder and exaggerates the importance of the Gordons' work. Corey silently dislikes how the reporter exaggerates it because there is no public evidence of the work connecting them to biological warfare or theft. Corey is jealous of Beth liking Ted Nash. The two clash over who is the alpha male of the room. Beth, Corey, and Max are able to make Ted cave in to letting them go on Plum Island the next day. Corey then goes through the Gordons' book shelves and pulls out a map of the local boating water. He notices a mysterious code written on one of the pages. The next day he arrives early at the ferry station and sees George and Ted with the security director and other people in suits coming off the ferry, confirming his thoughts of a cover up. They do not see him and he gets on the ferry to Plum Island with the rest of the group from the previous night with Paul Stevens, the security director, who pretends he doesn't know Foster or Nash. They are brought to the island and given a bus tour. The group then walk through the long hallways with the head of the research center who has some humor, but seems to be scripted. The group meets a few scientists who are friends of Tom and Judy who were directing a project. The scientists also act like they are on a script and give cover up theories that suggest that the Gordons were underpaid government workers who stole a vaccine so they could \\"discover\\" it elsewhere and become rich and famous. Ultimately, the killer is proven to be Frederick Tobin, owner of a local winery, whose motive was financial.

This was followed by an attack on a student dormitory that night by vigilantes and riot police in which a student was killed. This in turn sparked six days of demonstrations and rioting in which at least three more people were killed and more than 200 injured.Six days that shook Iran BBC News 11 July 2000 A photojournalist for Jame'e newspaper, Jamshid Bayrami, took the Economist cover photo at that time. In the photograph, Batebi waves a bloody T-shirt above his head. The shirt belonged to the student standing next to Batebi, who had been shot. \\"The bullet hit the wall and ricocheted back into my friend's shoulder. I heard the bullet go by my face,\\" Batebi recalled. \\"It sounded like a bumblebee going by my ear.\\" In order to staunch the bleeding, Batebi removed his friend's shirt to put pressure on the wound. He then helped transport his friend to a medical facility. Returning to the protest with the bloody shirt, he displayed it to the protesters to warn them of the shooting.  Trial and prison life  Batebi was initially arrested in connection with the protests, several days after the publication of the Economist photograph. He was held without charges for about seven months, when he was brought to trial. At the trial, the judge showed Batebi the Economist photograph. It was the first time he had seen it. \\"With this picture, you have signed your own death sentence,\\" Batebi recalls the judge told him. Batebi describes the trial as follows: > \\"[The judge] said, 'You have defaced the face of the Islamic Republic that > is a representative of God on earth. You have defaced it around the world. > And therefore you have to be sentenced to death.' It took less than three > minutes.\\" He and many others protesters were brutally tortured. In prison Batebi wrote of beatings by guards: > I resisted and punched one of them in the face. At this point, they took me > and ducked my head into a closed drain full of excrement.

When I protested, they answered that this is the land of the Velayat and that I should be blinded and not live here.\\" Following an outcry from Iranians and international human rights groups, his death sentence was commuted to a 15-year prison term by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Upon appeal in early 2000, the sentence was further reduced to 10 years. Around March 2005, Batebi was temporarily released from Evin Prison in order to get married. He failed to report back to prison. On June 23, 2005, a newspaper interview reported him \\"currently on the run, avoiding the authorities in Iran\\". Batebi was re- arrested on July 27, 2006, and re-imprisoned. He continued to serve his sentence. However, his family was not told where he was detained until August 12, 2006, when he was permitted to telephone his wife. He was held in Section 209 of Evin Prison which is run by the Ministry of Intelligence. During a hunger strike in August 2006 \\"his doctor wrote an open letter to the prison authorities\\" stating that Batebi \\"required specialist care\\", and that \\"there was a risk he could die if he was not released.\\" Also adding to the fears for his life was the fate of another July 1999 protester, Akbar Mohammadi, who died in custody under suspicious circumstances in July 2006. By September 20, 2006, his relatives were permitted to visit him in prison three times. During their first two visits, Batebi's family was accompanied by four prison guards, although their third visit, on September 18, was reportedly less heavily supervised. Batebi was not permitted to see his lawyer. Amnesty International reported Batebi's physical and mental health was poor and deteriorating further. > \\"He suffers from a number of medical problems as a result of being tortured > and ill-treated during his previous period of detention, including stomach > and kidney problems.

Psychological abuse is reported to include denying Batebi \\"the opportunity to see daylight\\", forcing him \\"to wear a blindfold during exercise sessions in the prison yard.\\" In February 2007, Batebi was reported to have suffered two brain strokes over the course of a few days, having several seizures on February 16 spending \\"three hours in a coma\\" and suffering another two days later after being released from hospital. He was returned to the prison following his second stroke over the reported objections of hospital doctors who are said to have told prison officials that he requires follow up care in a hospital.Jailed Student Leader Batebi Suffers Brain Stroke from roozonline.com Following the strokes, Batebi reportedly told his father in a telephone call on February 22 that the prison authorities do not care about him and that if he dies, his father should \\"hold a celebration of my life, rather than a funeral\\". Somaye Bayanat, Batebi's wife, was detained at her house outside Tehran on February 21, 2007. \\"Her whereabouts are not known to Amnesty International. Amnesty International fears that she may be at risk of intimidation, harassment or ill-treatment because of her connection to Ahmad Batebi.\\"  Escape  While being temporarily released from Evin Prison to receive medical attention, Batebi fled the country into Iraq. Batebi's escape from Iran and eventual transfer to the United States began when he contacted internationally recognized immigration and human rights lawyer and activist, Lily Mazahery, on March 13, 2008, on the then existing Yahoo 360 social media site.Dissident‚Äôs Tale of Epic Escape From Iran Grip, By Scott Shane and Michael R. Gordon, The New York Times, July 13, 2008. He was further assisted by the KDPI and the Kurdish underground network who moved him to the northwestern border with Iraq and then to Arbil. Batebi's lawyer, Lily Mazahery, reported his critical situation in Arbil to the United States government, which provided Humanitarian Parole for his entrance to the U.S. Although Sweden had granted him asylum through UNHCR, after consulting his friends and lawyer in the U.S., Batebi preferred to reside there. On June 23, 2008, Batebi left Iraq for the United States. After a short airport transit through Austria, he arrived in Washington Dulles International Airport on June 24, 2008, where he was escorted by officials from the National Security Council from his plane to the international section of the airport, where the White House officials transferred his custody to his then lawyer, Lily Mazahery.  Aftermath  Ahmad Batebi, New York, Summer 2008 Following his escape to the U.S., Batebi appeared in an interview with Voice of America (VOA) Persian TV in which he explained the story of his escape. He announced that he intended to be a representative of Iran's human rights activists in the U.S. Some also criticized him for his frequent presence on VOA programs. Batebi was eventually hired by Voice of America Persian TV.

Biography Of German ancestry, he was born near Lebanon, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, on April 22, 1817. He attended Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg for about one year and then studied law with the office of James Cooper. He entered the bar in 1839. His political career started with public speeches in 1840 supporting William Henry Harrison for president. He started as a Whig but as that party collapsed, he looked elsewhere. For a time he was the Indiana leader of the Know-Nothings (called the American Party) and later aligned himself with the Republican Party. He served in the Indiana Senate from 1843 to1849, as acting-Lieutenant Governor of Indiana in 1845, and U.S. House representative from Indiana in 1863-1871, 1873-1875, and 1879-1882. \\"Godlove S. Orth is a fat, fluffy, pudgy-cheeked, good-humored old boy, with a volubility co-equal with the necessities of a politician, and a smile that is broad, bewitching, childlike, and bland,\\" the Chicago Times reported in 1876. \\"He has a good head, well stocked with information and experience, and is no fool.\\"Chicago Times, March 20, 1876. He was, in fact, a politician skilled at political survival, and had to be: as was so often the case with congressmen, local jealousies kept even the most able members from serving more than one or two terms, before some other county in the district demanded the nomination in recognition. Those jealousies and factional feuds nearly prevented his re- election in 1866, and in 1868 he had to fend off a serious challenge from General Lew Wallace. Survival therefore took assiduous cultivation of his constituents. In his district, as he informed another Republican, he kept a list of the top hundred party leaders for each county, and a file on some ten thousand other constituents, \\"pretty much all the reading Republicans and some Democrats in the District.\\" When he sent out public documents and books, or speeches from other House members, he would mail them to names on the first list; when he sent pamphlets and his own speeches, it went to the second. Naturally, he had a hearty appreciation of the franking system, as a way of not having to pay the postage costs.Godlove S. Orth to Daniel D. Pratt, October 27, 1868, Daniel D. Pratt Papers, Indiana State Library. Orth therefore made a reliable second-string leader for the House Republicans in the late 1860s. He stood at the more conservative end of his party during Andrew Johnson's administration: supporting Reconstruction, but trying to bring the President and Congress back into harmony, if it were possible. On the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he became the Grant Administration's most reliable point-man, and in 1871 the one to manage a resolution appointing a fact-finding commission sent to Santo Domingo to prepare the way for possible annexation. A Chicago Tribune correspondent described him as \\"as good a man as can be found, without prejudice, without notions, without fixed ideas upon any question. He is one of those men, who, upon large, general irresponsible principles are always right, but who are unpronounced upon little, local, and special questions.\\" That was not meant in criticism; the reporter thought him \\"one of the most law-observing, conservative, neighborhood constructions of manhood we know\\".Chicago Tribune, January 16, 1871. Despite his history with the Know-Nothings, near the end of his life, Orth stood as one of a small number of congressmen defending racial equality. He condemned the racial discrimination of the first Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), declaring that he would vote against the bill because \\"I am opposed to all legislation founded on 'race, color, or previous condition of servitude.' We have no such odious laws now upon our statute-book, and no vote of mine shall ever be given to place any there.\\"13 Cong. Rec. 2189 After his retirement from the House, Orth was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria. He resigned in the late spring of 1876, having been nominated in February for governor by the Republican party. Members of the reform wing distrusted Orth automatically, because he stood well with Senator Oliver Morton's political machine, and they doubted his personal integrity. They were strengthened in their suspicions when a newspaper charged him with participating in a ring of speculators that shook down Venezuelan claimants in disputes between injured parties in Venezuela and the United States and with lobbying the Congress to confirm those claims. With the ex-Congressman refusing to make a full explanation or convincing denial and with rumors of incriminating letters waiting to be released in what promised to be a hot campaign, Morton withdrew his public support. On August 2, Orth withdrew as candidate for governor, and was replaced by Benjamin Harrison. Orth was married twice, and had a daughter and two sons. He died in office in December 1882 in Lafayette, Indiana, just after losing a re-election bid to Thomas B. Ward, and is interred at Greenbush Cemetery in that city.

He was Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1742 to 1751. Boconnoc House, Cornwall Pitt was the grandson and namesake of the better known Thomas Pitt and the son of Robert Pitt, MP, of Boconnoc, near Lostwithiel in Cornwall. He was the elder brother of William Pitt the Elder. He succeeded his father in 1727 to his estates, including Boconnoc. As head of the family, Pitt inherited both his grandfather's immense fortune and his parliamentary boroughs - he had the complete power to nominate both MPs at Old Sarum and one of the two at Okehampton, as well as considerable influence in at least two Cornish boroughs, Camelford and Grampound. He had himself elected Member of Parliament for Okehampton in 1727, the first election after he came of age, and represented the borough until 1754; but on a number of occasions he was also elected for Old Sarum, which meant that when he chose to sit for Okehampton the Old Sarum seat was free to offer at a by-election to somebody else who had failed to get into Parliament. Pitt was Assay master of the Stannaries from March 1738 to February 1742 and Lord Warden of the Stannaries from February 1742 to March 1751, when the Cornish Stannary Parliament met for the last time. Pitt was ambitious for political influence and, attaching himself to the retinue of Frederick, Prince of Wales, managed the general elections of 1741 and 1747 in Cornwall in the Prince's interests; but this involved massive expenditure - especially at the notoriously-corrupt Grampound, where he spent huge sums both on bribing the voters and on lawsuits attempting to deprive the most rapacious of their votes. By 1751 he had bankrupted himself, and the death that year of the Prince of Wales destroyed his hopes of securing influence or patronage for his efforts. He mortgaged his boroughs to the Treasury, allowing the government to name two MPs at Old Sarum and one at Okehampton in return for a pension of ¬£1000 a year. After sitting briefly for Old Sarum in the 1754 Parliament, he resigned his seat and fled the country. Returning to England in 1761, however, Pitt persuaded the government to allow him to be once more elected for Old Sarum - a temporary measure, he promised, to prevent his being arrested for debt until he was able satisfy his creditors. (MPs were immune from civil arrest.) He promised to relinquish the seat at the earliest possible moment and allow the government to name his replacement in accordance with the original arrangement; but he died a few months later, still MP for Old Sarum. Pitt had married, c.1731, Christian, the daughter of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, M.P., of Hagley, Worcestershire and the sister of Lord Lyttelton. They had two sons and two daughters. He afterwards married, in 1761, Maria, the daughter of General Murray. Pitt died on 17 July 1761. His only surviving son was the first Baron Camelford, who repudiated his father's arrangement for Old Sarum, and chose himself as MP when he inherited the borough.

He was a Duma deputy and one of the leaders of the Constitutional Democratic party (known as the Kadets). Biography Shingarev's mother, Zinaida Nikanorovna was born into an aristocratic family. His father, Ivan Andreevich Shingarev, was a prosperous merchant, first in the Tambov region and then in Voronezh. When Andrei Shingarev was ten years old, he entered a secondary school in Voronezh, graduating in 1887. Then he continued his studies at Lomonosov Moscow State University in the faculty of physics and mathematics and graduated in 1891, in 1894 getting a further degree in medicine. In 1895‚Äì1897, Shingarev was a practicing doctor. In 1898 he became a country doctor and started managing the Voronezh medical district. Shingarev published in many newspapers and magazines, for example in the newspaper The Russian Idea. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution while he was in Voronezh. Shingarev was several times elected to the State Duma. After the February revolution, he led the food committee; in the first cabinet of the Provisional Government he was the Minister of Agriculture, and later he held the post of Minister of Finance. In July 1917 Shingarev resigned from the Provisional Government, as he was against the agreement with the Central Rada of Ukraine. He was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge called Grand Orient of Russia's Peoples. On November 28, 1917, Shingarev was arrested at the home of Sofia Panina by the Bolsheviks. As a leader of the opposition, he was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress. On January 19, 1918, he was transferred, along with his fellow Kadet Fyodor Kokoshkin, to the Mariinskaya Hospital after becoming seriously ill. Both \\"were brutally murdered there on the following night by a group of Baltic sailors, who broke into the hospital. The Ministry of Justice later revealed that the murders had taken place with the connivance of the Bolshevik Red Guard and the Commandant of the Hospital, Stefan Basov, who justified the murder on the grounds that there would be 'two less bourgeois mouths to feed'. Basov was brought to trial and convicted, but none of the murderers was ever caught and the Bolshevik leaders, who at first condemned the murders, later sought to justify them as an act of political terror.\\"Orlando Figes, A People's Tragedy (Penguin, 1998: ), p. 536n.

The winery and vineyards are located south of the city of Bordeaux, in the commune of L√©ognan. Ch√¢teau Haut-Bailly's vineyard is located along the left bank of the Garonne river. Neighboring estates include Ch√¢teau Malartic-Lagravi√®re, Ch√¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte and Ch√¢teau Carbonnieux. The estate's second wine is named La Parde de Haut-Bailly. A bottle of Ch√¢teau Haut-Bailly 1949, then under the Graves appellation, but with L√©ognan clearly labelled. History The vineyard is believed to have been created during the 16th century by a rich family from the Pays Basque region. By 1630 it was acquired by the Parisian banker Firmin Le Bailly, who gave his name to the estate. A classification of the leading Graves ch√¢teaux by Wilhelm Franck in 1845 illustrates that Haut-Bailly had become known by then, but came to be famous in 1872 when it was bought by Alcide Bellot des Mini√®res, a known viticulturist at the time. Followed by a period of prosperity, such as the 1878 vintage judged outstanding among its peers, there came a decline. With the onset of phylloxera, Bellot des Minist√®res also neglected to follow the examples of other estates who combated the disease, and instead of grafting, relied on spraying with copper ammonia solution. After Bellot des Minist√®res' death in 1906, the estate came to his widow, and then her daughter. After two decades, Haut-Bailly was sold to Franz Malvesin who during his ownership experimented with some questionable techniques, such as pasteurization and early bottling. After his death in 1923 practices were reverted to normal, though under the various following owners, the results were unremarkable. In 1955, the property was bought by the Belgian wine merchant Daniel Sanders, beginning a prosperous period of quality and restored reputation. Though known for his meticulous control, there was near the end of Sanders' life a perceived dip in quality in the 1970s, as he was reluctant to release management control to his son, but this eventually happened at his death in 1980, and Jean Sanders was able to resume progress. For several years the late oenologist √âmile Peynaud was retained at Haut- Bailly. The current owner, since 1998, is the estate of the late American banker Robert G. Wilmers who died on 16 December 2017, with Daniel Sanders' grand daughter Veronique Sanders functioning as general manager, and Gabriel Vialard employed as technical manager. Production The soil consists of sand mixed with the gravel that gives the Graves appellation its name. From a estate, the vineyard area extends with the plantings are divided up as 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The grapes for Haut- Bailly are harvested by hand, processed, and then fermented for up to ten days in both temperature controlled stainless steel and concrete vats of varying sizes. After maceration the wines are aged for eighteen months in oak barrels, many of which are new. In total the estate produces 150,000 bottles annually. In a typical vintage, between thirty and forty percent of the wine is relegated to the estate's second wine, La Parde de Haut-Bailly, produced since 1967, but under the name Domaine de la Parde until 1979. A generic Pessac- L√©ognan third wine, titled Pessac-L√©ognan by Chateau Haut-Bailly, has been produced since 1987. Unlike many producers from the Graves appellation, no white wine is made at Haut-Bailly.

This enterprise is known as cuniculture. Etymology The term was coined in mediaeval Latin as cunicularium (plural cunicularia), from Classical Latin cunicularis \\"pertaining to the rabbit\\", itself from cuniculus, from which the English \\"cony\\" (the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) derives. The Latin is taken from the Greek Œ∫œçŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ k√∫niklos (k√Ωniklos) (compare modern Greek Œ∫ŒøœÖŒΩŒ≠ŒªŒπ kouneli). The earliest known use of this word is in Polybius:Polybius (2nd century BC), Histories XII.3.1 An etymology has been proposed for the Greek word deriving it from a word meaning \\"burrow\\"; but it is more probable that evolution was to \\"(rabbit) hole\\" from \\"rabbit\\", rather than the reverse. It is most likely that the word is ultimately borrowed from the Iberian language. History =Ancient history= Polybius first described the cony at about the time that Ancient Greece fell under the sway of the Romans. However, the cony was introduced to the Romans from Iberia, as they quickly developed a taste for laurices after their conquest of Hispania. Rabbits are described by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia in the 1st century. The Romans are known to have raised rabbits in stone pens, probably to facilitate the harvesting of laurices. However, they seemingly did not use the term cunicularium; and the industry apparently collapsed as the Roman Empire fell. =Early Middle Ages= With the rise of monasticism several centuries later, a renewed interest in cunicularia arose, in part because they were productively and easily implemented within the monastic economic context. It was during this period that the cunicularium became established. =Late Middle Ages= Cunicularium was borrowed into Middle English as conygere, conyger, giving rise to numerous later variants such as conygarye, conyrie, and conygree. Difference between a warren and a cunicularium Although the words have become nearly synonymous in modern English, the two institutions followed parallel, but separate paths in their development. The common, or domestic warren developed out of the free warren hunting franchise. This was because only by creating a close, or enclosed area for the freeholder's domestic stock of rabbits, could that person claim ownership of the rabbits in it. A domestic rabbit which escaped into a nearby free warren could not be claimed as property, even if the freeholder held title to the soil over which the warren extended, unless that individual also possessed the royal warrant of them, or unless it had escaped from a close. Such a close was called a \\"cony-garth\\". A rabbit escaped from the cony-garth was the property of the freeholder. Note that in the following quote from a medieval law forbidding commoners the means to hunt, warrens are still distinct from connigries.Animal Law Center References Category:Animal breeding Category:Animal husbandry Category:Rabbits and hares ","title":"Cunicularium"},{"id":"5628486","text":"Maguindanao kutiyapi bearing ukkil motifs. The kutiyapi, or kudyapi, is a Philippine two-stringed, fretted boat-lute. It is the only stringed instrument among the Palawano people, and one of several among other groups such as the Maranao and Manobo. It is four to six feet long with nine frets made of hardened beeswax. The instrument is carved out of solid soft wood such as that from the jackfruit tree. Common to all kudyapi instruments, a constant drone is played with one string while the other, an octave above the drone, plays the melody with a kabit or rattan pluck (commonly made from plastic nowadays). This feature, which is also common to other related Southeast Asian \\"boat lutes\\", also known as \\"crocodile lutes\\", which are native to the region. For the Palawano, it is possible to arrange the beeswax frets into different patterns resulting in two different scales for the instrument. These are the binalig, a higher pitched scale similar to the pelog and accompanying style used to imitate that of the kulintang, and the dinaladay, a lower pentatonic scale used for teaching pieces of an abstract nature. In dinaladay, several tiers of difficulty revolve around main compositions: Patentek, Patundug, Banutun and Minudel; Patentek being the most straightforward, Minudel being the most-challenging. Binalig scale pieces include several archaic compositions now not played on the kulintang, and of these pieces Malapankuno (cock crowing) and Mapalendad are included. Any piece with a kinukulintangan affixed to its name is one that imitates the style of the kulintang instrument, of which the Sinulog a kinukulintangan; a piece that embellishes the main melody of the kulintang's Sinulog a kangungudan, is the most popular. The Kutiyapi may or may not be accompanied by one of several types of flutes; the palendag, suling, insi or tumpong. Singing is usually reserved for courtship purposes. Maranao Among the Maranao, pieces played by using bagu and andung scales (equivalents of the binalig and dinaladay scales used by the Maguindanao), and in contrast to Maguindanao pieces, the kutiyapi is also used as an accompanying instrument to bayoka or epic chants. Examples of older andung pieces include Kangganatan and Mamayog Akun. The Kudyapi (kotyapi) has also been as one of the instruments in several older light ensembles, including that of the kasayao-sa-singkil/kasingkil ensemble, the original musical accompaniment to the singkil dance (now rarely used in favour of conventional kulintang ensembles). This ensemble pairs the kotyapi with a jaw harp (kubing), suling, a pair of small double-headed drums known as gandangan (a drum now rarely used among the Maranao in favor of the single-headed dadabuan) and a single kulintang, in accompaniment to the bamboo poles used in the dance. Another archaic ensemble where the kotyapi was included was the Kapanirong, or courtship ensemble, in which the kotyapi was used with a kubing, small insi flute, a two-stringed bamboo zither serongagandi, and a brass-tray tintik. Dayunday performances Among both the Maguindanao and Maranao, a much more recent informal styles are also used. Dayunday is a performed in front of an audience using an improvisational vocal style based on both sangel sa wata (traditional lullaby) and bayok (epic chant sung in a cappella) genres, played in either binalig or dinaladay scales, that is used during weddings, election campaigns, religious celebrations such as Eid or other large gatherings. The dayunday generally sets well known musicians from both genders against each other in verbal jest and competition. With the advent of globalization, the importance of the kutiyapi has waned as artists have taken up the guitar instead, as it is louder. Lumad groups Lumad kudyapi (right) during the 2016 Kaamulan Festival of Bukidnon Among the T'Boli, Manobo and other Lumad groups, the instrument (known as Hegelung, Kudyapi or Fedlung) is tuned to a major pentatonic scale. Among groups like the Bagobo, the Kutiyapi (Kudlung) is also used as a bowed instrument and is generally played to accompany improvised songs. A characteristic difference between Mindanaon Moro Kutiyapi and the non-Islamized Lumad equivalents is the style and set up of vocal accompaniment. Among the Lumad groups, the kudyapi player and vocalist are separate performers, and vocalists use a free-flowing method of singing on top of the rhythm of the instrument, whereas among the Maguindanao and Maranao, there are set rhythms are phrases connected with the melody of the kutiyapi, with the player doubling as the vocalist (bayoka), if need be.  Visayan  The kudyapi has been found among groups such as the Bisayans who's prevalence just like the kubing and other musical instruments are and/or were found in other parts of the Philippines. \\"The kudyapi was a kind of small lute carved out of a single piece of wood with a belly of a half a coconut shell added for resonance, with two or three wire strings plucked with a quill plectrum, and three or four frets, often of metal. The body was called sungar-sungar or burbuwaya; the neck,burubunkun; the strings, dulos; the fretboard, pidya; and the tuning pegs, birik-birik. The scroll was called apil-apil or sayong, the same as the hornlike protrusions at the ends of the ridgepole of a house. The kudyapi was only played by men, mainly to accompany their own love songs. The female equivalent was the korlong, a kind of zither made of a single node of bamboo with strings cut from the skin of the bamboo itself, each raised and tuned on two little bridges, and played with both hands like a harp. A variant form had a row of thinner canes with a string cut from each one.‚Äù ‚Äì William Henry Scott Various names and similar instruments Also called: Kutyapi, Kutiapi (Maguindanaon), Kotyapi (Maranao), Kotapi (Subanon), Fegereng (Tiruray), Faglong, Fuglung (B'laan), Kudyapi (Bukidnon and Tagbanwa), Hegelong (T‚Äôboli) and Kuglong, Kadlong, Kudlong or Kudlung (Manobo, Mansaka, Mandaya, Bagobo and Central Mindanao), Kusyapi (Palawan) Similar instruments played throughout the region include the Sape of Sarawak and the Crocodile lutes of Mainland Southeast Asia.

These civilizations rose in the territory of modern Peru before the arrival of the Spanish.  Pre-Columbian art  A detail of the Raimondi Stela. This stela was found out of its original placement at the ceremonial complex, Chav√≠n de Huantar. It was cited by Pablo Picasso as an inspiration for his art. Peru's earliest artwork came from the Cupisnique culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav√≠n culture, which was largely north of Lima between the Andean mountain ranges of the Cordillera Negra and the Cordillera Blanca. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and ceramics to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their architecture and wood sculpture. Between the 9th century BC and the 2st century CE, the Paracas Cavernas and Paracas Necropolis cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded complex textiles, many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns. The 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, Moche, in the Lambayeque region. The Mochica culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the Huacas del Sol y de la Luna and the Huaca Rajada of Sipan. They were expert at cultivation in terraces and hydraulic engineering and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works. Another urban culture, the Wari civilization, flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in Ayacucho. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as Pachacamac, Cajamarquilla and Wari Willka. Between the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban Tiwanaku empire rose by the borders of Lake Titicaca. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of architecture and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing bronze, which enabled them to make the necessary tools. Urban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the Chim√∫ Culture. The Chim√∫ built the city of Chan Chan in the valley of the Moche river, in La Libertad. The Chim√∫ were skilled goldsmiths and created remarkable works of hydraulic engineering. The Inca Civilization, which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like Cusco, architectural remains like Sacsahuaman and Machu Picchu and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.

In this context, the stalls of the Cathedral choir, the fountain of the Main Square of LimaFountain of the Main Square of Lima both by Pedro de Noguera, and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the Cuzco School that taught Quechua artists European painting styles. Diego Quispe Tito (1611-1681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and Marcos Zapata (1710-1773) was one of the last. Painting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians Mateo P√©rez de Alesio and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J. Rodriguez. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baroque Style also dominated the field of plastic arts.

Montero, Ignacio Merino, Daniel Hern√°ndez Morillo and Francisco Masias. Modern and contemporary =Indigenous movement= The establishment of the Fine Arts School of Lima (1919) had a decisive influence on Peruvian sculpture and painting. In sculpture, some of the most remarkable artists include Luis Agurto, L. Valdettaro, Joaquin Roca Rey, J. Piqueras, Alberto Guzm√°n, Victor Delf√≠n and F. S√°nchez. Among the painters, Daniel Hern√°ndez, R. Grau, Cesar Quispez Asin and Jose Sabogal are particularly notable. Sabogal headed the indigenous movement, which was one of the main influences on Peruvian contemporary painting. Among the most notable painters in the indigenous movement was Julia Codesido. Some of the most widely recognized painters are Fernando de Szyszlo, Alberto Davila, Armando Villegas, Sabino Springett, Bernardo Rivero, J. Alberto Tello Montalvo, Victor Humareda, M. A.

Explorations in the Highlands of Peru, 1922  Contemporary Art  Teresa Burga is a multimedia artist that works with conceptual art since the 60s and 70s. She was a pioneer in media art, art and technology and installation art in Peru. She is one of the most important non-objectualist artists of those decades in Peru. In sculpture Cristina G√°lvez was one of the most influential artists and art educators. In the 1980s after the art festival Contacta 1979 the group Huayco was created by Charo Noriega, Mariella Zevallos, Maria Luy, Armando Williams, Herbert Rodriguez and Juan Javier Salazar. This group appropriated the means of production and iconography of popular aesthetics. Within the history of Contemporary Art in Peru the Third Biennial of Trujilo in 1990 played an important role. This biennial included local artists as well as artists from neighboring countries. Jorge Eduardo Eielson and Jorge Piqueras were among the exhibiting artists that returned to Peru from Europe to participate within this biennial. It was the last biennial in Trujillo. In 1992 the artist Jaime Higa presented an exhibition at The Museum of Italian Art in Lima curated by Gustavo Buntinx. The 80s were marked by the civil war and artists responded to the political situation. Among these artists are Eduardo Tokeshi, Ricardo Wiesse and Alfredo Marquez. Later on in 1997 the First Ibero American Biennial was produced in Lima directed by Luis Lama. This biennial allowed for the exchange of ideas and a wider exposure for Peruvian artists. A memorable moment within this biennial was the unexpected performance by Elena Tejada-Herrera, which became an milestone within the history of Peruvian performance art. In 1999 Tejada-Herrera was awarded the first prize in the contest Passport for and Artist with a performance for which she hired street sellers performing on the streets of Lima. Another milestone in the history of contemporary Peruvian art is the Travestite Museum created by the philosopher and drag queen Giussepe Campuzano in 2003. =Folk art= Chulucanas pottery originates in the Piura Region.

It stars Nick Nolte, Timothy Hutton, Armand Assante and Lumet's daughter, Jenny Lumet. Plot Mike Brennan, a tough, crude, decorated NYCPD detective lieutenant, has a dark side and a partnership with certain organized crime figures. Brennan shoots dead a small-time Puerto Rican criminal and then threatens witnesses to testify that he acted in self-defense. The Head of the District Attorney's Homicide Bureau, Kevin Quinn, assigns the case to Deputy District Attorney Aloysius \\"Al\\" Francis Reilly, a young lawyer and past police officer and the son of an NYCPD cop killed in the line of duty. Reilly collects a deposition from Brennan, who claims to have been acting on an informant's tip and acted in self-defense. Reilly's information leads him to \\"Bobby Tex\\", a Puerto Rican crime boss called Texador, whose wife Nancy Bosch is an ex of Reilly. She ended their relationship years ago after interpreting Al's surprise when she introduced him to her black father as racism. Al tries to rekindle their romance, but she rejects him because with Bobby she feels loved, protected and accepted for who and what she is. Al, along with detectives Sam \\"Chappie\\" Chapman and Luis Valentin, has doubts about the shooting, knowing the environment of the Puerto Rican underworld. Investigations reveal a link between Quinn and Brennan while Brennan seeks out Roger \\"the Dodger\\" Montalvo, the only witness who can disprove his testimony. Brennan tries threatening Valentin and offering to bribe Chappie for help in finding and silencing Montalvo. Meanwhile, Bobby Tex is \\"invited\\" by the Mafia to step aside as a drug dealer, as Brennan's support remains useful to them. Bobby, in turn, begins looking for Montalvo as leverage against Brennan. He also begins shutting down his business to retire with Nancy in Puerto Rico. Bobby finds Montalvo before Brennan does and they leave for Puerto Rico where Bobby owns a mansion and a yacht. Al is summoned to share relevant information. Al, after informing Chief Deputy District Attorney Bloomenfeld, goes to the island, where it is revealed that Quinn (nicknamed \\"Skinny\\") was once part of Bobby's street gang, and shot a rival gang member. Brennan appears to be hunting down the gang's former members on Quinn's orders to erase Quinn's past, to fulfill his ambitions to run for NY State Attorney General. Brennan has no choice because Quinn holds an abuse of authority charge over him from his early years on the force. The Mafia intends to close accounts with both Bobby and Brennan, whose position is increasingly untenable. They fail in attempting to kill Bobby, who has announced his retirement. Meanwhile, Brennan finds Montalvo's lover, the transgender Jos√© Malpica and, using a voice message from Roger that he is \\"on a boat chalked the 'Nancy' in Puerto Rico, kills Malpica after listening to a message from Montalvo on his answering machine that reveals his location. Brennan finds Montalvo and strangles him. He then slices the boat's fuel line and waits for Bobby to arrive. A phone call made by Al saves Nancy, but Bobby is killed in the explosion. Al procures an arrest warrant for Brennan but fails to catch him at the airport. He returns to the DA's office to find Brennan waiting. Brennan reveals the truth about Al's father; that he was a bagman and bigot, who was part of a \\"line\\" to keep minorities down, and shoots Chappie when he tries to intervene. Brennan is then shot dead by another officer. Al is summoned by Quinn, who informs him that he is aware of his activities, but the Department is going to hush up the incident to avoid embarrassment given the upcoming mayoral election. When Al threatens to go to the papers, Bloomenfeld tells him that he has ways of preventing that and reminds Al that sources in the mayor's office could leak evidence of misconduct on the part of his late father, which would deny his mother her widow's service pension. Feeling betrayed and disillusioned, Al trashes his office and resigns. He searches for Nancy, hoping she will return to him but when he finds her, she meets his marriage proposal with silence as she is mourning Bobby's death. Cast * Nick Nolte as Lt.

Hutton said, \\"In many cases the hands of the officer on the street are tied\\". Nick Nolte put on 40 lbs. for the film because he felt that the character he played required it: \\"Just the sheer mass of brutality. I felt that would be the right kind of thing. He had to be on the edge of his own dissipation\\". Reception Q&A; received positive reviews from critics, as the film holds an 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"It is fascinating the way this movie works so well as a police thriller on one level, while on other levels it probes feelings we may keep secret even from ourselves\\". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \\"Great little scenes overshadow bigger, more important ones. Characters come and go at speed. Watching the movie is an entertaining ride, but when it is over it is difficult to remember where, exactly, one has been\\". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \\"Lumet tries to cram too much in ... But he's onto something, and you can sense his excitement. This is Lumet's boldest film in years -- a combustible drama with a vivid, shocking immediacy. The director is back at the top of his game\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson praised Nick Nolte's performance: \\"This actor doesn't flinch in the least from his character's unsavoriness; instead he seems to glory in his crumpled suits and unwashed hair, as if they were a kind of spiritual corollary. Nolte gives Brennan a kind of monumental brutishness -- he makes him seem utterly indomitable\\". USA Today gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"Overkill ultimately wears Q & A down, despite two bravura performances and some Hutton understatement that's adequate to the task. So, too, does unrelenting sordidness, a deadly love angle and a score (Ruben Blades) almost as awful as Cy Coleman's sabotage of Lumet's Family Business\\". In his review for The Globe and Mail Rick Groen praised Armand Assante's performance: \\"in a role that could easily descend into cliche - the crook with a moral code - Assante does his best work to date, always keeping on the safe side of the stereotype\\". Newsweek magazine's David Ansen wrote, \\"Nolte, with a big paunch and a walrus mustache, is a truly dangerous presence here; he uses his threatening body and a high, strained voice to stunning, scary effect. Like the movie, Nolte really gets in your face and, for a long time afterwards, sticks in your craw\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A-\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"Q & A is a major film by one of our finest mainstream directors. As both a portrait of modern-day corruption and an act of sheer storytelling bravura, it is not to be missed\\".

Santa Mar√≠a de Bogot√°, 2018. A picador (; pl. picadores) is one of the pair of horse-mounted bullfighters in a Spanish-style bullfight that jab the bull with a lance. They perform in the tercio de varas, which is the first of the three stages in a stylized bullfight.  Function  The picador has three main functions in a traditional bullfight: * To pierce the muscle on the back of the bull‚Äôs neck in order to straighten the bull's charge. * To fatigue the bull‚Äôs neck muscles and general stamina as it tries to lift the horse with its head. * To lower the bull‚Äôs head in preparation for the next stage. If the public feels that a picador is better than the bull the public will whistle, boo or jeer as they see fit. This is because they do not want the bull to lose all its strength and energy as this can lead to a dull bullfight. The picador is obliged to give the bull two lances in a first category bullring (Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Zaragoza etc.), but the matador may request that the second be waived in second and third category rings. The bull may receive three lances if it is particularly ferocious. The aim of the bull to charge the picador is often cited as the biggest test of its courage. A bull that does not charge may be punished with a black banderilla, which although somewhat longer than a normal banderilla is largely symbolic and a mark of shame for the breeder.  History  Picador in action, 2005. Horses did not wear protection since 1928 and the bull would on occasion disembowel the horse during this stage. In Seville, Spain they retain two teams of muleteros, one to drag out the dead bull and the other to drag out any dead horses. The horse is surrounded by a peto, a mattress-like protection that greatly minimizes damage taken. Injuries to the horses often include broken ribs and damage to internal organs. In the original days before bullfighting became recognizable in today's form, the picador was the central attraction and his name would be billed on the promotional flyers. In these bullfights the bull would charge the horse and the spectacle was watching the rider's skill in protecting his horse whilst lancing the bull. The picador would lance the bull as many times as necessary. The matador and other bullfighters were on hand to help the picador, to direct the bull to the picador, and finally to finish off the injured bull. It was not until certain foot bullfighters started to bring some flair to their minor roles, to the pleasure of the crowd, that matadors started to become the main attraction, ultimately relegating the picador to a relatively unpopular and minor function.

History Crosville bus stop poster at Porters Lodge, Aberystwyth On 27 October 1906, Crosville Motor Company was formed in Chester by George Crosland Taylor and his French business associate Georges de Ville, with the intention of building motor cars. The company name was a portmanteau on the names of the founders. In 1909, Crosville commenced its first bus service, between Chester and Ellesmere Port. By 1929 Crosville had consolidated an operating area covering the Wirral and parts of Lancashire, Cheshire and Flintshire. The Railways (Road Transport) Act, 1928 gave the four railway companies the opportunity to provide bus services. But rather than run in competition they bought into or purchased outright existing bus companies. In February 1929, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway made an offer of ¬£400,000 to purchase Crosville, which was effected in November 1929. The new LMS (Crosville) company then in the next few months purchased Holyhead Motors, and UNU Motor Services of Caernarfon. Shortly afterwards, the four railway companies reached an agreement with the Tilling Group and British Automobile Traction (T&BAT;) to complete a cross-holding deal, whereby each organisation held a 50% share in a series of jointly-held and consolidated regional bus companies. LMS (Crosville) was therefore merged with T&BAT;'s Royal Blue of Llandudno, and renamed Crosville Motor Services on 15 May 1930, after only nine months of outright LMS ownership.Companies House extract company no 248119 North British Bus Limited formerly Crosville Motor Services Limited In the next few months the company consolidated its majority share of the North Wales coastal services, buying up various smaller private companies that operated in the Crosville area, including: White Rose Motor Services of Rhyl, Red Dragon of Denbigh, Burton of Tarporley, North Wales Silver Motors and Llangoed Red Motors. On 1 May 1933, the Great Western Railway's northern Welsh service Western Transport was amalgamated with Crosville. In 1930 All-British Travels Ltd was formed by coach operators George Taylor of Chester, Alfred Harding of Birkenhead and J.W. Scott of Edinburgh, with sleeping partner Evan R. Davies, a solicitor in Pwllheli. Under the fleet name of 'All-British Line' the initial intention was to run express coach services to and from Liverpool and Llandudno to London via Taylor's Market Square car showroom in Chester and to operate a central London travel agency to advertise those services and the other coach services of the respective companies. This express coach service to London commenced on 14 April 1930. By 1933 Crosville, who had also started an express coach service between Liverpool and London in 1929 and All-British Travels Ltd, attempted to co-ordinate the Liverpool to London service, thereby complying with the North Western Traffic Commissioner's decree to reduce the duplication of that service. A joint timetable was worked on but problems co- ordinating the service proved impossible to surmount. In January 1933 the coach operator, Red & White Services of Chepstow in South Wales, purchased All-British Travels Ltd and in September of that year the remaining All- British Line express coach service between Liverpool and London operated by Taylor ceased. Taylor continued in the coach excursion business and car trade in Chester up to 1972. =Second World War= Although the start of the Second World War brought about cuts in the company timetable, by the end of the war the company had increased passengers by 50% and revenues by 90%. This was through North Wales being seen as a safe area from Luftwaffe bombing, resulting in a number of shadow factories and munitions factories being built in the area. This resulted in the expansion of a number of formerly quiet villages, and hence the route map changed quite dramatically. In example, ROF Wrexham, Marchwiel needed over 200 buses daily. This passenger demand brought about a change in fleet policy, with the relatively small double deck fleet being considerably expanded, mostly with second-hand vehicles as production capacity at most bus manufacturers had been given over meet the requirements of the military. On 3 December 1942, Crosville became a subsidiary of the Tilling Group, resulting in a change from maroon to Tilling-green livery, and Bristol-chassised buses replacing Leyland as the manufacturer of choice. Crosville emerged from the war far stronger in many ways, with healthy cash reserves in the bank or accumulating nicely in property assets, unable to replace their fleet at their normal renewal rate. However, although Crosville focused on replacing its single-deck fleet with double deckers, Tilling had a group policy against investment in coaches, resulting in a rise across the geography of a number of new coach operators. By the time that the post-war government of Clement Attlee merged both Tilling and the railway companies into the British Transport Commission on 1 January 1948, and Crosville was nationalised, the coach operators were a sustainable competitive entity. =1948‚Äì67= Bristol in August 2012 Preserved Bristol MW in June 2009 Preserved Bristol RE in May 2013 Preserved Eastern Coach Works bodied Bristol VRT in September 2011 New Bristol double-deckers had become the standard fleet purchase for all Tilling/BET fleets, which allowed the company to serve the post-war boom until 1950, when traffic began to fall again thanks to the increase in the number of private cars. The combination of this, plus the Suez Crisis of 1956 and a lack of staff due to low wages, lead to a general contraction of the network out of countryside routes and to reduce operations by at least half on a Sunday. The network continued to decline, except in the provision of a new service to replace railways removed by the Beeching Axe, with the 1965 introduced \\"Cymru Coastliner,\\" between Chester and Caernarfon anticipating the closure of that British Rail route and the intermediate stations. =1968‚Äì85= The Transport Act 1968 created the National Bus Company (NBC), and introduced the principle that rural bus services could be subsidised by councils. Although they had reduced costs by the introduction of one-man operation, Crosville submitted a list of 196 routes that required financial assistance. With the transfer of routes of the North Western Road Car Company within Greater Manchester to the local Passenger Transport Executive in 1971, NBC split the residual services of NWRCC between Trent and Crosville, with the latter company taking over 119 vehicles and depots in Northwich, Macclesfield and Biddulph in March 1972. A consolidation of companies within NBC resulted in Crosville taking over services in parts of West Wales from Western Welsh, including those from the depots in New Quay, Newcastle Emlyn and Lampeter. The company continued to consolidate and reduce its network through the 1980s, making losses of ¬£1M in 1980 and ¬£2M in 1981. Rebranding of local services in metropolitan areas assisted in flattening the rate of decline in revenues, but losses continued to mount. =Deregulation= On 13 February 1986, the Secretary of State for Transport decided that, because of their size, the four largest NBC companies would be split, as they provided too great a competitive threat to deregulation. Crosville was split into two, with the English and Welsh operations divided between two businesses.NBC loses battle on company carve-up Commercial Motor 22 February 1986 page 3 Ultimately, both businesses were acquired by the Drawlane Group.Drawlane splits CMS Commercial Motor 2 November 1989 page 17 Crosville Cymru was to remain generally in one piece, but most of the remainder of Crosville based in England was split between then-sister companies Midland Red North and the new North Western company based in Liverpool. The latter move was quite a reversal of fortunes, as much of Crosville's territory in the eastern half of Cheshire had been gained from the original North Western company at its dismemberment in 1972.

History =Early locomotives= Baltimore and Ohio Crab, the Mazeppa, built around 1837 and photographed after years of service. The name Tom Thumb is forever associated with the B&O;, as the first steam locomotive built in the United States for an American railroad. It was built strictly as a demonstrator, but it was succeeded by a series of similar locomotives (the \\"Grasshoppers\\" and the \\"Crabs\\") designed by Ross Winans, the first head of motive power on the railroad.J. Snowden Bell, Chapter I: The \\"Grasshopper\\" and \\"Crab\\" Engines -- type 0-4-0, The Early Motive Power of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; page 19. Early B&O; designs were quite unlike those used on other roads, due to in-house design and the emphasis of pulling power. 4-2-0 locomotives from Norris (represented by the \\"Lafayette\\" reproduction in the B&O; museum's collection) were the anomaly on a railroad which was already building eight-coupled (0-8-0) locomotives well before the Civil War.J. Snowden Bell, Chapter IV: The Eight-Wheel Connected Freight Engines -- Type 0-8-0, The Early Motive Power of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Sinclair, New York, 1912; pages 55-86, see particularly Fig. 22 on page 57. By the beginning of the war, new power on the railroad had become more conventional, though many of the older, unconventional designs remained. Up until 1884 locomotive numbers were reused when locomotives were retired; numbers were not allocated sequentially (unless lower numbers were used up). In 1884, in order to reduce confusion, all locomotives were renumbered to group like locomotives together, and thereafter numbers were retired along with the locomotive to which they referred. =The Baltimore Belt Line and electrification= John W. Garrett's desire to have a line to New York led to the construction of the Baltimore Belt Line in order to bring the railroad across Baltimore. The most important feature of this was the Howard Street Tunnel, which began at Camden Station and headed north to Mount Royal Station. Objections to use of steam led, in 1895, to the first main line electrification in North America. Trains in one direction were pulled through the tunnel, by a series of electric locomotives that lasted until the end of steam; in the other direction, the train simply drifted down the slope. Dieselization made the electrification unnecessary and it was discontinued in 1952. =\\"Old Maude\\"= \\"Old Maude\\" from a Baltimore and Ohio postcard. Another innovation was the introduction of Mallet locomotives. Economies in haulage could be achieved by reducing the number of locomotives and trains needed, so ever more powerful locomotives were always sought. In 1904 #2400, a 0-6-6-0 design, was introduced, and quickly became known as \\"Old Maude\\" after a mule in a cartoon. \\"Old Maude\\" was renumbered to #7000 in 1915, and it boasted an impressive 71,500 pound tractive effort and was a great success at a Maximum speed of only 21 mph. It was the first Mallet in North America. Mallets were built in large numbers for the B&O;, culminating in the huge EM-1 2-8-8-4. =\\"Uncle Dan\\" and Colonel Emerson= In the presidency of Daniel Willard, the motive power department, headed by Col. George H. Emerson, entered on a long series of experiments intended to improve the performance of the steam locomotive. Particular emphasis was placed on the water tube boiler, as opposed to the fire tube boiler used from the earliest days of steam. (In practice, only the firebox used water tubes.) The culmination of these experiments was the duplex #5600 George H. Emerson, the first of its kind. It was to be succeeded by a visionary locomotive of a unique design, of which very little was built before the whole project was cancelled. Many other trials were conducted of steam locomotive appliances, very few of which had any lasting impact. At the turn of the 20th century various compound locomotives were tried, particularly of the Vauclain and tandem patterns. As on other roads, they presented maintenance problems, and only the Mallets were repeated. Some engines had scoops to take on water from track pans, which were found on the line to New York. The P-7 \\"president\\" engines were originally painted olive green, with the name of a United States president in gold on the cab; later they were painted a dark blue. Certain experimental engines had a British-style firebox door instead of the usual American Type. =Diesels= CNJ 1000 in 1957, as it was being retired from service. It is now at the B&O; Railroad Museum. Other trials, it can be said, changed the face of railroading. In 1925 the B&O; was one of the buyers of the first model of diesel locomotive, of which CNJ 1000 was the first example. These were used as yard engines in areas where smoke abatement led to restrictions or bans on the use of steam. In 1935 a single unit mainline diesel-electric engine (#50) was constructed; this was eventually transferred to the Chicago and Alton Railroad, an affiliated line. Finally in 1937 the B&O; bought the first multiple unit diesel locomotives to power its passenger trains. And in 1937 they ran the first coast to coast use of diesel electric locomotives.\\"Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1937 The railroad put an end to the steam locomotive experiments, though wartime pressures would lead to purchase of many other new steam locomotives. Dieselization took many years, and in the meantime a long program of upgrading older locomotives was continued. The P-7 Pacifics were particularly targeted for improvements, culminating in the Cincinnatian, for which four of the engines were upgraded and streamlined to a design by Olive Dennis, who also supervised the refurbishment of the rolling stock. The B&O; did not emphasize standardization, and when road diesels were bought, they were purchased from nearly every manufacturer. By the time of the railroad's purchase in 1963, though, they were well on their way to becoming the all-EMD line which they remained to the end. In 1954 a group of steam switchers was renumbered to free up numbers in the 600s and 700s for diesels. Then in 1956 all locomotives were renumbered again. All steam locomotives were renumbered below 1000, thus freeing all four digit numbers for use by the growing numbers of diesels. Locomotive Classification Before the Civil War, the B&O; organized its locomotives into four classes, based upon relative power. After the war this was felt to be inadequate, and a classification scheme was devised, based upon wheel arrangement. Each wheel arrangement was assigned a letter, except for 4-4-0 locomotives, which were subdivided according to cylinder size. When articulated steam locomotives were first introduced, they were assigned a single class (\\"O\\"). This proved inadequate almost immediately and a two letter code was used instead, based on treating the locomotive as if it were two engines coupled back-to-back. Within each letter class, a number was assigned for each successive design. Usually the first class was numbered \\"1\\". Locomotives acquired through mergers were renumbered and reclassified to fit into the sequences of numbers and classes. Lowercase letter suffixes were used to denote successive modifications of a design. The \\"t\\" suffix was also used to indicate that the locomotive was assigned an extra large tender. In the 20th century, such modifications were common, and the pattern of suffixes could become confusing. At one point there was even a class \\"Qodd\\" Mikado (2-8-2). Diesel locomotives were initially classified according to intended service and model. Eventually this was dropped in favor of using the manufacturer's model designations. Steam classes were as follows: *A initially 4-6-0 camelback locomotives; later 4-4-2 *B 4-6-0 *C 0-4-0 *D 0-6-0 *E 2-8-0 *F 4-4-0 with 16\\" dia. cylinders or less *G 4-4-0 with 17\\" dia. cylinders *H 4-4-0 with 18\\" dia. cylinders *I 4-4-0 with 19\\" dia. cylinders *J 4-4-0 and 4-4-4 with Wootten fireboxes *K 2-6-0 *L 0-8-0 *M 4-4-0 with 20\\" dia. cylinders *N 4-4-4-4 ‚Äî One locomotive: #5600 George H.

Jessup was dead within a year, and his widow conveyed his share to Thomas Hunt of Westchester, whose family is commemorated in the name of Hunts Point. In 1711, the heirs of the patentees joined in a second division of the lands in twelve lots with immutable boundaries, which were subsequently divided up. During the American Revolution numerous engagements occurred here; there were too few able-bodied men to form a company of continental militia, so West Farms formed a joint company with Fordham.Petition of 1775 to the Continental Congress, printed in Bolton 1848:271f.

The entirety of Community District 6, which comprises West Farms and Belmont, had 87,476 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 77.7 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 29% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 28% between 25‚Äì44, and 20% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 14% and 9% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 3 and 6, including Crotona Park East and Morrisania, was $25,972. In 2018, an estimated 31% of West Farms and Belmont residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in six residents (16%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 60% in West Farms and Belmont, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , West Farms and Belmont are gentrifying. Land use and terrain West Farms is dominated by 5 and 6-story tenement buildings, older multi-unit homes, vacant lots, and newly constructed subsidized attached multi-unit townhouses and apartment buildings. Most of the original housing stock was structurally damaged by arson and eventually razed by the city. The total land area is less than one square mile. The terrain is somewhat hilly. The West Farms Bus Depot is located along East 177th Street next to a terminated Sheridan Expressway; it opened on September 7, 2003 on the site of the former Coliseum Depot.

Police and crime West Farms and Belmont are patrolled by the 48th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 450 Cross Bronx Expressway. The 48th Precinct ranked 56th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 152 per 100,000 people, West Farms and Belmont's rate of violent crimes per capita is greater than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 1,015 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole. The 48th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 71.7% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 11 murders, 29 rapes, 276 robberies, 396 felony assaults, 182 burglaries, 424 grand larcenies, and 76 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Many social problems associated with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, have plagued the area for decades. Despite declines in crime from its peak during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community. West Farms has significantly higher drop out rates and more incidents of violence in its schools than in other parts of the city.NYC Dropout Rates Other problems in local schools include low test scores and high truancy rates. Drug addiction is also a serious problem in the community. Peer pressure among children who come from broken homes contributes to the high rate of usage. Fire safety West Farms contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 45/Ladder Co. 58/Battalion 18, at 925 East Tremont Avenue.

Faber & Faber) The Shield of Achilles is a poem by W. H. Auden first published in 1952, and the title work of a collection of poems by Auden, published in 1955. It is Auden's response to the detailed description, or ekphrasis, of the shield borne by the hero Achilles in Homer's epic poem the Iliad. Description Auden's poem is written in two different stanza forms, one form with shorter lines, the other with longer lines. The stanzas with shorter lines describe the making of the shield by the god Hephaestus, and report the scenes that Achilles' mother, the Nereid Thetis, expects to find on the shield and which Hephaestus, in Auden's version, does not make. Thetis expects to find scenes of happiness and peace like those described by Homer. The stanzas with longer lines describe the scenes of a barren and impersonal modern world that Hephaestus creates in Auden's version. In the first scene described by these stanzas, an anonymous, dispassionate army listens. In the second scene, a crowd of ordinary people watch passively as three \\"pale figures\\" are dragged towards and tied to posts. In the third scene, a \\"ragged urchin\\" throws a stone at a bird; he takes it for granted \\"that girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,\\" and \\"has never heard of any world where promises are kept / Or one could weep because another wept.\\" In the closing stanza, composed of short lines, Thetis cries out in dismay at what Hephaestus has made for her son, \\"who would not live long.\\" In these contrasting stanzas, Auden reflects on the differences between the vital, lyrical Achaean world described by Homer where, even amid warfare, imagination naturally ran to scenes of peace, and the violent, barren world, lacking any hope and meaning, that Auden himself imagines. Collection The poem is the title work of The Shield of Achilles, a collection of poems in three parts, published in 1955, containing Auden's poems written from around 1951 through 1954. It begins with the sequence \\"Bucolics\\", then miscellaneous poems under the heading \\"In Sunshine and In Shade\\", then the sequence Horae Canonicae. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Poetry in 1956. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1956\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-25.

He went on to become the best chess player in the region and is now regarded as one of the important masters of pre-World War II Europe. In 1931, he earned a master's degree in French and Latin language and literature from the University at Lviv. He also acted, during WW II, Greek-Catholic Metropolitan Andrew Sheptytsky‚Äôs personal secretary until 1944. In 1929, Popel won a championship of Lviv, followed by E. Kaufman, Henryk Friedman, Oskar Piotrowski, etc. In 1929 and 1934, he was a member of Lviv team at 1st and 2nd Polish team championships. In 1934, he was a member of Polish team at Correspondence Olympiad. In 1935-1936, he took 9th at Correspondence Championship of Poland. In 1943, Popel published his handbook Poczatki szachista (Introduction to Chess) in Ukrainian at Krak√≥w. In 1943, he tied for 1st with Myroslav Turiansky at Lviv (GG). In 1943, he won at Sambor (GG). In 1944, he won at Sanok (GG). Because of the Red Army's approach, he did manage to avoid deportation to Siberia or any worse fate during the Soviet occupation (e.g., that of Vladimirs Petrovs). Joining the westward exodus in 1944, Stepan Popel wound up in Krak√≥w. In 1944, he drew a match against Fedor Bogatyrchuk at Krak√≥w (2 : 2). At the end of war, he escaped to West. Finally, he came to France. In 1950/51, Popel won at Hastings (Premier Reserve Major). In 1951, he won the 26th Paris City Chess Championship. In 1951/52, he tied for 4th-6th at Hastings.

In 1954/55, he played at international tournament at Paris. In 1955/56, he took 2nd at Hastings (The Premier Reserves Major). In 1956, Popel was authorized to migrate to the US. As an American master, he won three times the Michigan state championship, in 1957, 1958, and 1959. He also won the North Central Open at Wisconsin in 1957, where his young competitor Bobby Fischer took 6th place. In 1958, he took 4th at North Central Open, and took 6th at Western Open. Both those events were won by Pal Benko. Around 1960, Stepan Popel became a professor of French language and literature at North Dakota State University in Fargo. He continued to enter tournaments, and he became eleven-time North Dakota champion (from 1965 to 1980). In 1966, he took 2nd at a championship of Ukrainian Sport Centrale of America & Canada.

Their church was founded by the duke of Podolia, Micha≈Ç Krasicki, and constructed in the years 1627-1631 Juraj Buzalka, Nation and religion: the politics of commemorating in south-east Poland, 2007, Lit Verlag, 2007, pp. 91-94 most probably according to the design of Galleazzo Appiani.

The Austrian authorities also blocked the ongoing construction of a Greek Catholic Cathedral (an already erected belfry was later turned into a clock tower) and instead offered the town's Ukrainian population the confiscated Carmelite Church as part of a plan to solidify their rule over the newly acquired territory by setting its inhabitants against each other. In 1884, Ukrainian architect Mykola Zakharevych, a professor at Lviv Polytechnic, designed and built an addition a dome modeled that was modeled on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome which also incorporated elements of Ukrainian wooden church architecture. This dome was meant to symbolize the Ukrainian congregation's connection to the Vatican.Peremyshl church cupola dismantled amid protests Ukrainian Weekly July 21, 1996 =20th century= The 1925 Concordat between Poland and the holy See confirmed that the building belongs to the Greek Catholic Church.

In 1946 Carmelite friars, who were forced to leave their monasteries in Soviet Ukraine, settled in Przemy≈õl and returned to the empty church. In 1991, shortly after Poland regained full independence and the Church was able to freely operate, the church building became a focal point of Polish-Ukrainian tensions. The Roman Catholic Church decided to transfer the building to the Greek Catholic Church for the period of five years during which the Greek Catholics would construct a new sanctuary in Przemy≈õl and then give the church back to the Carmelite Order. The Ukrainians, who perceived the return of the building as historical justice, had no intention of doing so. Local Poles occupied the church to prevent its transfer, and the Roman Catholic Church transferred a former Jesuit church to the Greek Catholics. Pope John Paul II wished to return the church to the Ukrainian Catholics who had used it prior to their expulsion by the Soviets. The Carmelites begun modification of architectural details of the Cathedral to give it more of a Latin-rite appearance and erase traces of the church's links to Ukrainian Greek Catholicism.Paul J.

The clay used to build porcelain tiles is generally denser. They can either be glazed or unglazed. Porcelain tiles are one type of vitrified tiles and are sometimes referred to as porcelain vitrified tiles. Historically, porcelain was not the usual material for tiles, which were much more often made of earthenware (terracotta) or stoneware. The first porcelain tiles were made in China, for example in the 15th-century Porcelain Tower of Nanjing (now largely destroyed). Here the tiles were used for walls, which long remained typical. In Europe, a few rooms were made in palaces of porcelain plaques, often with forms in high relief. These were made by Capodimonte porcelain and Real F√°brica del Buen Retiro among others. Although porcelain has now been widely used for making tiles for many years, modern production methods and quantities have made porcelain tiles available for the average householder in recent years. Production Large-scale production of porcelain tile is undertaken in many countries, with the major producers being China, Italy, Morbi India, Spain and Turkey. There are also countries undertaking small-scale production, such as Australia and strong growth in Brazil. The wear rating of the tile can be graded from zero to five according to ISO 10545-7 (also, ASTM C1027) test for surface abrasion resistance of glazed tile, and this can be used to determine suitability for various end use conditions. Modern polished porcelain floor tiles in a large format Polished Porcelain tiles The dense, hard surface of porcelain has made polishing a viable alternative to a glazed surface. This means that a tile can be fired, then a polish cut into the surface, creating a shine without a glaze. Use Porcelain is much harder than ordinary ceramic tiles and is usually selected, despite its higher price, for its hard-wearing nature. Porcelain can be used in both wet and dry areas such as bathrooms, showers and kitchens. Disadvantages of Porcelain Porcelain is denser and therefore heavier to handle than other ceramic tiles. For this reason, it is generally more expensive. Being harder, it is more difficult to cut and drill and requires specialist tools, which can hamper fitting and increase costs. Polished porcelain may need sealing, where ordinary glazed tiles do not. The glazed surface is coated with less than two microns. Cutting Porcelain Tile There are several ways to cut a porcelain tile. Power tools like an angle grinder, tile cutter, tile nipper, drill bit can be used to do this. However, the most effective way is to use a wet tile saw because of its versatility and cutting capacity. Adhesives Specialised cements are necessary for installation of porcelain tiles, and in the US specifications, are set by the Tile Council of America and supported by the Tile Contractors Association. Porcelain, being denser and heavier than ordinary ceramic tiles, needs a stronger adhesive to hold the weight on walls. Therefore, typical ready-mix adhesives are not recommended for porcelain. Sealing When porcelain is first made, it is not absorbent, but the polishing process for making the unglazed surface shiny cuts into the surface, leaving it more porous and prone to absorbing stains, in the same way as natural stone tiles. Unless they have a suitable, long-lasting treatment applied by the manufacturer (for example, nanotech treatment), polished porcelain tiles may need sealing. Porcelain sealants are either solvent-based or water-based, which is cheaper, but does not last. Vitrification Porcelain tiles can be vitrified to reduce their porosity and increase their strength. Vitrified porcelain tiles are created by combining clay with other elements such as quartz, silica or feldspar under incredibly high temperatures. The vitrification process creates porcelain tiles that contain a glass substrate. The glass substrate gives the tiles a sleek appearance, provides added strength and makes the tiles water and scratch-resistant. Vitrified porcelain tiles do not need to be re-sealed or glazed.

He was diagnosed with the disease in October 1977 and made a full recovery. Although he had many contacts, none of them developed the disease, and an aggressive containment campaign was successful in preventing an outbreak. Smallpox was declared to have been eradicated globally by the World Health Organization (WHO) two years later. Maalin was subsequently involved in the successful poliomyelitis eradication campaign in Somalia, and he died of malaria while carrying out polio vaccinations after the re-emergence of the poliovirus in 2013. Smallpox eradication in Africa Smallpox is an infectious disease caused by two strains of virus, Variola major and V. minor. V. minor is the rarer of the two strains, and causes a much less severe disease (sometimes called alastrim), with a fatality rate of around 1%. No treatment is available, and the only protection is vaccination. The virus is usually transmitted by prolonged face-to-face contact with a person showing symptoms. The incubation period averages 12‚Äì14 days.CDC: Smallpox Factsheet: Smallpox Disease Overview (accessed 15 February 2013) One of the most feared diseases of human history, smallpox was still causing an estimated 2 million deaths every year as late as 1967.Porter, ed., p. 33Tucker, p. 3 Smallpox virus The global effort to eradicate smallpox from endemic areas such as Africa began in 1959 with a mass vaccination campaign. This approach met with little success, and a more effective targeted approach was developed in the late 1960s. This involved active surveillance by case hunting, combined with rapid containment of infection in areas reporting outbreaks by intensive vaccination.Behbehani, pp. 490‚Äì492 The majority of African countries were free from smallpox by 1972. By the end of 1975, the virus had been eradicated worldwide except in Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa, and their neighbour Kenya.Behbehani, pp. 494, 496‚Äì497MMWR: Smallpox Surveillance ‚Äì Worldwide (accessed 15 February 2013) The nomadic people of the Ogaden Desert retained endemic smallpox with an unusually mild form of the disease, which facilitated persistence in the population.Behbehani, p. 493 From 1975, WHO efforts were concentrated on this region. Ethiopia saw its last case in August 1976 and Kenya in February 1977.Tucker, pp. 115‚Äì116 Somalia proved particularly challenging because much of its population of 3.5 million was nomadic. A mass vaccination campaign in the country in 1969 had failed because many nomadic people in the region had cultural objections to vaccination, and either refused or avoided it.Behbehani, p. 497Tucker, pp. 113‚Äì114 Elimination efforts relied on an intensive reporting system. A severe drought in 1975 exacerbated the difficulties by increasing movement across the border with Ethiopia, and frequent outbreaks continued. In March 1977, surveillance efforts found over 3000 cases in the south of the country. The Somali government declared a state of emergency and successfully appealed to the United Nations for assistance. By June, when the outbreak peaked, 3,000 Somali health workers supervised by 23 international advisers were involved in the eradication efforts. Eradication work was hampered in July when the Ogaden War broke out, limiting access to the desert. Maalin's case Maalin worked as a cook at the hospital in the port-town of Merca in southern Somalia, as well as an occasional vaccinator for a WHO smallpox eradication team. He had not been successfully vaccinated, even though smallpox vaccination was obligatory for hospital employees. According to CDC epidemiologist Jason Weisfeld, one of the people who led the later containment effort in Merca, Maalin had received the smallpox vaccine but it had failed to take, and he had not been protected.PBS: Rx for Survival series: The End of Smallpox: Part II ‚Äì The Last Case (streaming video)CDC: Smallpox Eradication: Memories and Milestones (26 October 2007) (accessed 15 February 2013) Other sources state that he had not been vaccinated.Barrett, ch. 2 In an interview in 2007, Maalin said that he had not been vaccinated, explaining: \\"I was scared of being vaccinated then. It looked like the shot hurt.\\" In August 1977, an outbreak developed in a Somalian nomadic group of twenty families; eight children developed symptoms in August to October. On 12 October 1977, two children with smallpox symptoms were discovered at an encampment near the small inland settlement of Kurtunawarey, around 90 km from Merca. Local officials drove the children to Merca, where there was a nearby isolation camp. Maalin, then aged 23, served as a guide to the party taking them in a closed Land Cruiser from the hospital where he worked either to the home of a surveillance supervisor or directly to the isolation camp. He is believed to have been infected during the journey, which lasted no more than 5‚Äì15 minutes. One of the children, a six-year-old girl named Habiba Nur Ali, died two days later. She was the last person to die from naturally acquired smallpox. The outbreak among the nomadic group was successfully contained by WHO workers by 18 October, but ‚Äì critically ‚Äì investigators failed to identify Maalin as a contact.Tucker, pp. 117‚Äì118 On 22 October, Maalin fell ill with fever and headache, and received malaria treatment in hospital. After four days a rash appeared. Perhaps working on the assumption that he had been successfully vaccinated against smallpox, Maalin was then believed to have chickenpox and was discharged from hospital.Behbehani, pp. 499‚Äì500 Over the next few days, his symptoms developed to indicate smallpox as the cause. Not wishing to be put into isolation, Maalin failed to report himself. On 30 October, a male nurse colleague reported him, possibly for the reward of 200 Somali shillings (around $35), and Maalin was transferred to the isolation camp. He was diagnosed with an infection of the Variola minor strain of smallpox, based on his symptoms and later confirmed by laboratory tests. The date of diagnosis is sometimes stated as 26 October 1977.Fenner et al., p. 1249 Maalin did not experience complications, and subsequently recovered fully and was discharged in late November. Donald Henderson, who directed the WHO eradication programme from 1967 until 1976, describes Maalin's case as \\"a classic one in depicting omissions and mistakes in program operations.\\" Maalin, described by Henderson as \\"a popular man,\\" had been visited by many relations and friends during his illness before he entered isolation. While hospitalised with fever, he had walked freely around the hospital, interacting with multiple patients.American Medical News: Smallpox ‚Äì The Death of a Disease (book excerpt) (accessed 14 February 2013) Containing the potential outbreak Multiple measures were used to contain the potential outbreak in the town of Merca. The response was coordinated by Weisfeld and Karl Markvart. Maalin's contacts were all traced by the WHO eradication team. A total of 161 contacts were identified, 41 of whom had not been vaccinated. There were 91 people who had been in face-to- face contact with Maalin, 12 of whom were unvaccinated. Some of his contacts lived up to 120 km outside the town. All contacts were kept under surveillance for six weeks. His face-to-face contacts and their families were vaccinated, but none showed any sign of having been infected. Merca Hospital was closed to new patients, all its medical staff were vaccinated and existing patients were quarantined in situ. The residents of the fifty houses neighbouring Maalin's lodgings were vaccinated, and vaccinations were later extended to the ward of the town in which Maalin lived. House-to-house searches throughout the entire town looked for cases. Police checkpoints on all exits to the town, including footpaths, were established to vaccinate anyone passing who had not been recently immunised. A total of 54,777 people were vaccinated in the two weeks following Maalin's isolation. The response later broadened, with monthly house-to-house searches across the region widening to a search throughout Somalia, completed in December 1977. The containment efforts proved effective and, on 17 April 1978, WHO's Nairobi office sent a telegram stating: \\"Search complete. No cases discovered. Ali Maow Maalin is the world's last known smallpox case.\\" Although there was one further smallpox outbreak in 1978 acquired from a laboratory in Birmingham, UK, Maalin remains the last case of naturally acquired smallpox in the world. On 26 October 1979, two years after the day when Maalin's rash appeared, WHO declared that smallpox had been eradicated globally.Behbehani, p. 498 Later life and involvement in polio eradication campaign Maalin remained in the Merca area, where he was employed in a range of roles. In the mid-1990s, he was selling medicines in a nearby small town. Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate poliomyelitis from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008. He explained his motivation for volunteering: \\"Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too.\\"BBC News: War-torn Somalia eradicates polio (25 March 2008) (accessed 14 February 2013) Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities.Boston Globe: Polio: A fight in a lawless land (27 February 2006) (accessed 15 February 2013)WHO: Somalia is again polio-free (28 March 2008) (accessed 15 February 2013) The Boston Globe described him as one of the \\"most valuable\\" local coordinators for WHO. He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: \\"Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I tell them how important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me.\\" He continued to work as a regional coordinator for the vaccination drive, and was hailed as one of the \\"true heroes\\" of the campaign.George R. Camp, \\"True heroes of polio eradication\\", (18 July 2013, accessed 24 July 2013) After the 2013 reintroduction of poliovirus into Somalia, Maalin was again carrying out vaccinations in the Merca district when he developed a fever, and died days later, on 22 July 2013, of malaria.

Early life His father was a barrister-at-law, and his mother a nurse. A few years after the death of his father, his mother took Slade and his sister to live in Barbados where he attended Harrison College. In 1952, he went to the University College of the West Indies on a scholarship, coinciding with Derek Walcott and Mervyn Morris as students. Slade Hopkinson was active in university theatre. He directed Oedipus and King Lear. He obtained his BA in 1953 and a Dip. Ed. in 1956. Career He worked in Jamaica as a teacher, weekly newspaper editor, and a government information officer. He married (Freda) and had two children, Nalo (now making her name as a novelist - Brown Girl in the Ring and Midnight Robber) and Keita (an accomplished Classical Realist painter, and jazz impresario - founder of TorontoJazzBuzz).\\". In 1962 the family went to live in Trinidad and Slade Hopkinson joined Derek Walcott's Trinidad Theatre Workshop and was a celebrated Corporal Lestrade in Dream on Monkey Mountain. He studied at the Yale Drama School on a Rockefeller scholarship between 1965 and 1966, taught at the University of Guyana (1966‚Äì68), then returned to the TTW. However, by 1970 there was a falling out with Walcott and he founded the Caribbean Theatre Guild in 1970. His writing career began in 1954 with the publication of The Four and Other Poems; the plays, The Blood of a Family (1957), Fall of a Chief (1965), The Onliest Fisherman (1967), and Spawning of Eel (1968), rewritten as Sala and The Long Vacation. In 1976 the Government of Guyana published two companion collections of poetry, The Madwoman of Papine, which contained mainly his secular poems ranging over his Caribbean experiences, and The Friend, which contained his religious and philosophical poems, written in the process of discovering the teachings of the Sufis. Hopkinson was also active in the \\"Anira\\" literary group, which operated out of the home of Martin Carter's mother and included Carter, Sydney Singh, Jan Carew, Milton Vishnu Williams and others. In addition, Hopkinson wrote a couple of short stories, and his poetry was widely published in journals such as Bim, Savacou, New World and in anthologies such as Anansesem, The Penguin Book of Caribbean Verse and Voiceprint. Snowscape With Signature, a selection of the poems written between 1952 and 1992, was published by Peepal Tree Press in 1993, with an introductory memoir by Mervyn Morris. Later life Slade Hopkinson became a Muslim in 1964, changing his name to Abdhur Rahman Slade Hopkinson. By 1970 he was suffering from kidney failure and by 1973 was on regular dialysis, bringing to an end his acting career. He worked for the Jamaican Tourist Board for some years before moving to Canada as Vice-Consul for Guyana. Later he worked as a classroom assistant and teacher before taking long-term disability leave. Abdhur-Rahman Slade Hopkinson, by then suffering a cancer of the kidneys, died just before the publication of the Snowscape With Signature collection.

The cave contains petroglyphs and pictographs from the Native Americans who lived in the area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The cave is a deep hole in the sandstone, discovered in 1878 by 18-year-old Frank Samuel while trapping raccoons. He squeezed into a hole that an animal had dug in a bank and emerged into a dark cavity. On the walls the young coon-hunter found simple images left by people before him. That winter some local boys built fires inside their secret cave and carved their own names on the walls. Brown's tracing of one of the carvings, as it appeared in 1879. The following summer the Rev. Edward Brown visited Samuels' cave. He traced the carvings and persuaded Frank's father to open the mouth of the cave and protect the interior. Brown reported the finding to the State Geologist and the State Historical Society, and they sent antiquarian archaeologist John Rice to direct excavation of the floor. They uncovered four layers of ashes separated by layers of clean sand ten to fourteen inches thick. The second layer contained sherds of pottery made from clay and ground shells. The third layer contained more elaborate pottery, bivalve shells, and a bone tool. Brown and Rice interpreted the layers as four occupations of the cave with long intervals of vacancy between. When the rock shelter was occupied, its mouth had been fifteen feet wide, but a landslide had sealed it until the animal burrowed through. Based on trees growing on the landslide, Brown and Rice estimated the landslide had occurred at least 150 years before. Modern archeologists recognize the shell-tempered pottery that Brown described as a hallmark of the Oneota people, so at least some of the artwork was probably produced by them, which places it from 1300 to 1625 A.D. thumb thumb Some images on the walls were carved and some were painted. There were animals which Brown interpreted as bisons, lynx, rabbit, otter, badger, elk and heron. One panel showed a hunter and an elk. Another showed a hunter pointing a bow and arrow at a deer, with a child behind him. Another showed a human figure with a head-dress, which Brown interpreted as a chief. Other designs were indecipherable. In 1984 archaeologists from the Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse visited Samuels' Cave and noticed a panel of charcoal drawings on the back wall which had not been recorded before. (Photos of some of these drawings are online at MVAC's Rock Art website, linked among the notes below.) Many of the images in the cave were pretty intact when Frank Samuel found them in 1878, since they had been protected by the landslide for many years. But once the mouth of the cave was reopened, moisture and temperature changes resumed working away at the sandstone. Over the years many people visited the cave, some carving their own marks on the walls. After all this, many of the prehistoric images have been badly damaged, so the cave is no longer open to the public.

Throughout most of its life, its masthead has been featuring the tagline \\"\\" (\\"the magazine that comes out on Wednesdays\\"). Its mascot is a nameless jester, known simply as \\"el buf√≥n\\", who is always fully naked, except for his bell-bearing hat. History El Jueves debuted on 27 May 1977, at a time when satirical magazines were highly popular in Spain despite the scant freedom of the press. Its founder, Josep Ilario, creator of other humor magazines such as Barrab√°s and Por favor, wished El Jueves to be an adult version of Bruguera's model of children's magazines, made of character-focused comic strips lampooning stereotypes of contemporary Spanish society. Its first editors, cartoonists Tom, Romeu and J. L. Mart√≠n, drew inspiration from French magazines such as Hara-Kiri and Charlie Hebdo, which they admired for their extremely irreverent tone. Its first director was journalist Jos√© Luis Erviti. Among the contributors in the first issue was Joaquim Aubert \\"Kim\\", whose comic strip \\"Mart√≠nez El Facha\\" (an archetypal Spanish Falange militant and Franco nostalgic) had the longest run in the history of the magazine, appearing without interruption for 1,972 weeks. Some other of its earliest and most emblematic contributors were √ìscar Nebreda, Ventura y Nieto, Gin, Mariel, and Ram√≥n Tosas Iv√†, whose most successful comic-strip, starring the street- wise delinquent \\"Makinavaja\\", has been adapted into a play, two feature films, and a television series. The magazine was acquired by publishing group Grupo Zeta in October 1977. In 1982 Grupo Zeta sold El Jueves to its directors J.L. Mart√≠n, √ìscar Nebreda and Gin, who went on to incorporate Ediciones El Jueves. Throughout the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, their company grew vastly and published several other magazines with a spin-off spirit, such as Puta Mili and Mister K. It also expanded into film and television production. Following the deaths of several important contributors in the 90s (Gin, Iv√°, Nieto and cartoonist Jaume Perich), a younger generation of artists joined in and became iconic collaborators. Among them are Manel Fontdevila and Albert Monteys, both of which served as directors. Other contributors of international fame are Jordi Bernet, Miguelanxo Prado, Pasqual Ferry and Joan Cornell√†. In 2007 RBA Edipresse acquired Ediciones El Jueves. Profile A regular issue of El Jueves consists of 70-80 pages, about a quarter of them focused on current social/political affairs and popular culture. The rest are weekly comic strips and a few text-based sections. El Jueves has a leftist political stance and a critical approach. Some enduring sections of El Jueves include (\\"We had more covers\\"), a collection of alternative cover cartoons summarizing the week's events, and (\\"Douchebag of the week\\"), a tongue-in-cheek award to the most stupid public deed or remark seen in the news, often given to politicians. The 2008 circulation of the magazine was 77,495 copies. Controversies =2007 seizure= The 18 July 2007 edition of El Jueves was sequestered on 20 July for an alleged violation of laws 490.3 and 491 on insults to the Crown in their cover cartoon.

The cartoon, appearing on the same week king Juan Carlos I announced his abdication, showed the king passing on a crown of steaming excrement to his son Prince Felipe. The cartoon was agreed upon in a special editorial meeting on the same Monday of the announcement, but the publisher withdrew it on Tuesday, after it was printed. On Wednesday, the editorial staff were told not to allude to the royal family in the front cover.

A roofer from Rockford, Illinois, he was only one of two contestants on Big Brother 1 to have children. He later appeared on the All Star edition (season 7), starring past players from the previous six seasons. Big Brother =Big Brother 1= While in the house, Boswell became known as \\"Chicken George\\" and \\"The Chicken Man\\" for taking care of the chickens in the house. George was frequently upset about things that occurred in the house, and at one point attempted to convince the HouseGuests to walk out in protest, which never happened. George was marked for eviction twice, receiving a total of nine nominations. When George was nominated in the eighth week, his family and hometown rallied to get the votes to keep him, resulting in Brittany's eviction and causing much controversy outside of the house. George was ultimately evicted on Day 78, coming in fifth place. George is thus far the only HouseGuest from the first season to appear in a future installment of the series, returning to compete in Big Brother: All-Stars (2006). He later made a guest appearance in Big Brother 10 (2008), marking his last appearance in the series. =Big Brother 7= Boswell was the only Houseguest from that season eligible to enter the All-Star house. This is likely in part to the fact that Big Brother 1 was a much different game than the seasons that followed. As well, winner Eddie McGee and fan favorite Brittany Petros were both approached and declined the invitation to return. Big Brother 1 had lower ratings and played more like the international versions of Big Brother. Despite this, George was chosen to enter the All-Star house by the producers. He became the eighth male to enter the house, leaving the gender division in the house at 8-6 instead of the usual even split. In the early days of the game, George was often ridiculed and dismissed as a minor resident of the house. As time passed, however, he began gaining recognition as a potential threat due to his under-the-radar personality. Some houseguests have compared him to Michael \\"Cowboy\\" Ellis, who many believed was taken to the final two of Season 5 because he was unlikely to win. On Week 3, James nominated George for eviction alongside Will, stating that having caught George eavesdropping on his conversations. George was unhappy about his nomination and began harbor some animosity for James. Seemingly against all odds, George won the Power of Veto. On the downside, he won the veto by choosing to eat only \\"slop\\" for the remainder of his time in the house. George made a very touching speech at the Veto Ceremony, claiming to feel honored to play with each and every Houseguest, and then he vetoed his own nomination. He was allowed to eat regular food for a week when Marcellas gave him the slop pass he won during Week 5's HOH competition. During Week 6, Head of Household Janelle was angry at Chicken George for having sworn on his kids that he wouldn't vote to evict Kaysar yet doing so anyway. However, George actually promised no such thing‚Äîhe actually told Kaysar he was unsure what he was going to do. Despite intentions to name George as a replacement nominee after Danielle Reyes won the Power of Veto, she chose instead to nominate Marcellas Reynolds, giving George safety for another week. At the beginning of Week 7 on Day 46, George won the Head of Household competition in a tie-breaker against Danielle. As part of a surprise double-eviction week, he was forced to immediately nominate two housemate for eviction live. He nominated James and Erika. However, James won the veto and George then nominated Howie. At the beginning of Week Eight, George was nominated alongside Janelle by Erika. Janelle won the veto and removed herself from the block, causing Head of Household Erika to nominate Danielle. Danielle Reyes was evicted the following Thursday, day 60. In addition, Day 60 included \\"Big Brother Overdrive\\", a game element where a full week's worth of play took place in an hour. George Boswell was nominated alongside Erika, but Erika won the Power of Veto. She was replaced with Mike, and George was then evicted by a 2-0 vote. Once evicted, George received a bucket of classic KFC chicken from a man dressed as Colonel Sanders, and was sent to the jury house.

Almost half of the population lives below the federal poverty line and receives public assistance (TANF, Home Relief, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid). The median income is significantly higher than that of other South Bronx neighborhoods. This is likely due to recent rezoning to increase commercial and residential activity in the area.

Accessed June 14, 2016. History The history of Port Morris, as with other neighborhoods, is sometimes confused by the lack of fixed official boundaries. Late in the 20th century the name was sometimes applied to the area to the west, into Mott Haven. Mott Haven by older definition lies to the west rather than north of Port Morris. =Settlement= Bruckner Bar & Grill at Bruckner Blvd and Third Avenue There is some evidence that a British paymaster ship went down off Port Morris's coast during the American Revolutionary War with millions of dollars in gold aboard. No recovery was ever made. The name comes from a deep water port established along the neighborhood's East River (Long Island Sound) waterfront by Gouverneur Morris Jr., son of Gouverneur Morris, in 1842. He built a two-mile (3 km) railroad from Melrose to his family's holdings on the waterfront, later called the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad, abandoned a hundred years later.Port Morris Branch, the so-called Bronx Swamp December 23, 2009, The LTV Squad =Development= The area is dominated by factory and warehouse buildings constructed in the mid-to-late 19th century, convenient to the railroad yards, of which the Oak Point Yard is the main survivor. Notable early businesses were the R. Hoe Co.; Cutler & Hammer Tool Works; Mothers Friend Shirt Waist factory (1888) at Willow Avenue between East 135th and 136th Streets; and the Estey Piano Company Factory (now designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission). While many of the early industrial buildings remain, they are little used for manufacturing anymore. The area was the site of the Hell Gate generating plant of Consolidated Edison, where George Metesky, the Mad Bomber who plagued New York City for decades was injured. The most notable architectural/engineering feature of Port Morris is the northern approach to the Hell Gate Bridge supported by concrete arches (1917) northward from East 132nd Street, between Willow & Walnut Avenues. Plans are afoot to extend the South Bronx Greenway to Randalls Island, crossing Bronx Kill via the Randall's Island Connector under Hell Gate Bridge. The Connector opened in November 2015.South Bronx Greenway A wave of arson during the 1970s destroyed or damaged many residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area. Late in the century industry began to return to Port Morris. Many abandoned residential buildings are also being rehabilitated and designated low income housing. =Gentrification= 133rd Street gate of New York Post printing plant The neighborhood has been experiencing massive revitalization with many historic warehouses, factories and various manufacturing buildings being converted into lofts. The former Estey Piano Corp factory, now The Clock Tower, has the restaurant Charlies Bar & Kitchen operating on the ground level. Port Morris has become a burgeoning community of artists and other young professionals looking for more reasonable options outside of Manhattan. Efforts by the New York Restoration Project are underway to revive the waterfront in an area that historically suffers from high asthma rates. This will create much-needed green space for the community. As a result of these changes, the neighborhood is slowly becoming well known as a hub for upscale eateries in the South Bronx. Silvercup Studios is planning on converting a 115,000-square-foot warehouse located on 295 Locust Avenue for film and television productions. The facility is scheduled to open in June 2016. A NYC based real estate developer The Bluestone Group, has been actively acquiring buildings in the Port Morris and Mott Haven area, purchasing large warehouse buildings for conversion to creative office space, charter schools, hotels, as well as housing. in June 2016 Bluestone purchased the 275,000 square foot former Union Standard Equipment Co. building at 825 East 141st Street for $44 million. Looking north along Third Avenue at Beethoven Piano factory, the site of one of the proposed luxury towers The Piano District is the name proposed by two developers for Port Morris. The two developers, Somerset Partners and The Chetrit Group, purchased two riverfront properties for $58 million with the goals of establishing luxury residences and retail. However, there is opposition to the renaming, and critics and proponents have accused one another of racism. The developers were criticized by Melissa Mark-Viverito, the president of the New York City Council for conducting a Halloween rave, attended by numerous celebrities and featuring flaming trash cans and hulks of burnt-out and bullet-riddled cars. Mark-Viverito accused the developers of a lack of empathy and basic awareness.

It is probably native to southern Europe, though its long history of cultivation makes its precise origin unknown, and it may possibly be of garden origin. It is also widely naturalised farther north in Europe (as far as southern England) and elsewhere in warm temperate regions of the world.The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening 1: 462.Interactive Flora of NW Europe: Calendula officinalis. eti.uva.nlFlora of China, ÈáëÁõèËèä jin zhan ju Calendula officinalis Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 921. 1753. Flora of North America, Calendula officinalis LinnaeusAltervista Flora Italiana, Calendola medicinale Calendula officinalis L. The Latin specific epithet officinalis refers to the plant's medical and herbal uses. Description Calendula officinalis is a short-lived aromatic herbaceous perennial, growing to tall, with sparsely branched lax or erect stems. The leaves are oblong-lanceolate, long, hairy on both sides, and with margins entire or occasionally waved or weakly toothed. The inflorescences are yellow, comprising a thick capitulum or flowerhead 4‚Äì7 cm diameter surrounded by two rows of hairy bracts; in the wild plant they have a single ring of ray florets surrounding the central disc florets. The disc florets are tubular and hermaphrodite, and generally of a more intense orange-yellow colour than the female, tridentate, peripheral ray florets. The flowers may appear all year long where conditions are suitable. The fruit is a thorny curved achene and weight in average 10.1 mg (n=50). Calendulas are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moth, gothic moth, large yellow underwing, and setaceous Hebrew character. Cultivation A double- flowered cultivar Seeds Calendula officinalis is widely cultivated and can be grown easily in sunny locations in most kinds of soils. Although perennial, it is commonly treated as an annual, particularly in colder regions where its winter survival is poor, and in hot summer locations where it also does not survive. Calendulas are considered by many gardening experts as among the easiest and most versatile flowers to grow in a garden, especially because they tolerate most soils. In temperate climates, seeds are sown in spring for blooms that last throughout the summer and well into the fall. In areas of limited winter freezing, seeds are sown in autumn for winter color. Plants will wither in subtropical summer. Seeds will germinate freely in sunny or half-sunny locations, but plants do best if planted in sunny locations with rich, well-drained soil. Pot marigolds typically bloom quickly from seed (in under two months) in bright yellows, golds, and oranges. Leaves are spirally arranged, 5‚Äì18 cm long, simple, and slightly hairy. The flower heads range from pastel yellow to deep orange, and are 3‚Äì7 cm across, with both ray florets and disc florets. Most cultivars have a spicy aroma. It is recommended to deadhead (remove dying flower heads) the plants regularly to maintain even blossom production. =Cultivars= Orange Calendula officinalis at the UBC Botanical Garden Numerous cultivars have been selected for variation in the flowers, from pale yellow to orange-red, and with 'double' or 'semi-double' flowerheads with ray florets replacing some or all of the disc florets. Examples include 'Alpha' (deep orange), 'Jane Harmony', 'Sun Glow' (bright yellow), 'Lemon' (pale yellow), 'Orange Prince' (orange), 'Indian Prince' (dark orange-red), 'Pink Surprise' (double, with inner florets darker than outer florets), 'Green-heart Gold' (double, bright yellow), 'Apricot Pygmy' (double light peach) and 'Chrysantha' (yellow, double). 'Variegata' is a cultivar with yellow variegated leaves. The cultivar group 'Fiesta Gitana' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Uses  Pot marigold florets are edible. They are often used to add color to salads or added to dishes as a garnish and in lieu of saffron. The leaves are edible but are often not palatable. They have a history of use as a potherb and in salads. Flowers were used in ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern, and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb, as well as a dye for fabrics, foods, and cosmetics. Many of these uses persist today. They are also used to make oil that protects the skin. Marigold leaves can also be made into a poultice that is believed to help scratches and shallow cuts to heal faster, and to help prevent infection.  Constituents  The petals and pollen of Calendula officinalis contain triterpenoid esters and the carotenoids flavoxanthin and auroxanthin (antioxidants and the source of the yellow-orange coloration). The leaves and stems contain other carotenoids, mostly lutein (80%), zeaxanthin (5%), and beta-carotene. Plant extracts are also widely used by cosmetics, presumably due to presence of compounds such as saponins, resins, and essential oils. The flowers of Calendula officinalis contain flavonol glycosides, triterpene oligoglycosides, oleanane-type triterpene glycosides, saponins, and a sesquiterpene glucoside. Calendula flowers are a rich source of lutein, containing 29.8mg/100g. Potential pharmacology Plant pharmacological studies have suggested that Calendula extracts may have anti- viral, anti-genotoxic, and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. In an in vitro assay, the methanol extract of C. officinalis exhibited antibacterial activity and both the methanol and the ethanol extracts showed antifungal activities. Along with horsetails (Equisetum arvense), pot marigold is one of the few plants which is considered astringent despite not being high in tannins.

He was Drawing Master to Queen Victoria for 22 years. He was Vice President of the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours, on Pall Mall in London, for twenty years.  Life  Leitch was born in Glasgow, the son of a soldier who had previously been a sailor. Leitch soon developed a strong inclination for art, and used to practise drawing at night with David Macnee, afterwards president of the Scottish Academy. After a good general education, he found employment in a lawyer's office, then as a weaver, then as an apprentice to a Mr. Harbut, house-painter and decorator. In 1824 he was engaged as a scene-painter at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, and married Susannah Smellie, who bore him five sons and two daughters. The theatre failing, he spent two years at Mauchline, painting snuff boxes, and then moved to London, where he made the acquaintance of artists David Roberts and Clarkson Stanfield, and obtained employment as a scene-painter at the Queen's Theatre (now demolished) on Charlotte Street. He had some lessons from Copley Fielding, and was employed by Mr. Anderden, a stockbroker, to make drawings for a work he was writing. Santa Maria Del Carmine, Naples (1840) After exhibiting two drawings at the Society of British Artists in 1832, he travelled to the continent in 1833, passing through the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland to Italy. While in Venice he met and became friends with the Hungarian painter, Mikl√≥s Barab√°s; They toured and painted in the Lago Maggiore region in 1834, and Leitch was a great influence on Barab√°s's future work. After an absence of four years, during which Leitch supported himself mainly by teaching, and had visited the principal cities of Italy, and made numerous sketches there and in Sicily, he returned to London in July 1837. He now devoted himself almost entirely to teaching and drawing in watercolours. He had great success as a teacher and could count many members of the aristocracy amongst his pupils. He was introduced to Queen Victoria by Lady Canning and became the drawing master to her majesty and the royal family for 22 years. The Princess of Wales was his last pupil. Leitch exhibited occasionally at the Royal Academy between 1841 and 1861, but in 1862 was elected a member of the Institute of painters in Watercolours (RI). From that time he contributed regularly to its exhibitions but did not exhibit elsewhere. He served as the society's vice-president for 20 years. Leitch died in April 1883 at his home in St. John's Wood.Tooley, p. 246. A posthumous collection of his works was exhibited at the Institute of Painters in Water Colours' gallery in Piccadilly. Only two of his children survived him. His eldest son, Robert, a good watercolour painter, died in 1882. His brother, Richard Principal Leitch (1826-1882) was also an artist.  Work  Landscape (1867) Leitch was a master of his art, which was based on a profound study of nature and of the great masters, especially Turner in his prime. His works are marked by their graceful composition, their pure colour, and the brilliant effects of atmosphere. Among the books illustrated with engravings from his drawings are the Rev. Robert Walsh's \\"Constantinople and the Turkish empire\\" (1838); George Newenham Wright's \\"The Rhine, Italy and Greece\\" (1840), and \\"Shores and islands of the Mediterranean\\" (1841), William Brockedon's \\"Italy\\" (1843), Sir T. D. Lauder's \\"Memorial of the royal progress in Scotland\\" (1843), and John Parker Lawson's \\"Scotland delineated\\" (1847‚Äì54). The sketches in his possession at his death, with a very few finished drawings and oil pictures, were sold at Christie's in March 1884, and brought upwards of 9,000 pounds.

It is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable. It is a widespread species, native to eastern Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. It has been introduced and is an invasive species in many parts of Africa, Europe, North America, and South America.Tetragonia tetragonioides Invasive Species Compendium Its natural habitat is sandy shorelines and bluffs, often in disturbed areas.Tetragonia tetragonioides Flora of North America It is a halophyte and grows well in saline ground. Description The plant has a trailing habit, and will form a thick carpet on the ground or climb through other vegetation and hang downwards. It can have erect growth when young.Tetragonia tetragonioides Flora of China The leaves of the plant are 3‚Äì15 cm long, triangular in shape, and bright green. The leaves are thick, and covered with tiny papillae that look like waterdrops on the top and bottom of the leaves. The flowers of the plant are yellow, and the fruit is a small, hard capsule covered with small horns. Taxonomy Prussian naturalist Peter Pallas described the species as Demidovia tetragonoides in 1781. German botanist Otto Kuntze placed the species in the genus Tetragonia in his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, resulting in its current binomial name. This widely distributed plant has many common names, depending on its location. In addition to the name New Zealand spinach, it is also known as Botany Bay spinach, Cook's cabbage, k≈çkihi (in MƒÅori), sea spinach, and tetragon. Its Australian names of Warrigal Greens and Warrigal Cabbage come from the local use of warrigal to describe plants that are wild (not farmed originally). Cultivation It is grown for the edible leaves, and can be used as food or an ornamental plant for ground cover. As some of its names signify, it has similar flavour and texture properties to spinach, and is cooked like spinach. Like spinach, it contains oxalates; its medium to low levels of oxalates need to be removed by blanching the leaves in hot water for one minute, then rinsing in cold water before cooking. It thrives in hot weather, and is considered an heirloom vegetable. Few insects consume it, and even slugs and snails do not seem to feed on it. The thick, irregularly-shaped seeds should be planted just after the last spring frost. Before planting, the seeds should be soaked for 12 hours in cold water, or 3 hours in warm water. Seeds should be planted deep, and spaced apart. The seedlings will emerge in 10‚Äì20 days, and it will continue to produce greens through the summer. Mature plant will self-seed. Seeds will overwinter up to USDA zone 5. As food The species, rarely used by indigenous people as a leaf vegetable, was first mentioned by Captain Cook. It was immediately picked, cooked, and pickled to help fight scurvy, and taken with the crew of the Endeavour. It spread when the explorer and botanist Joseph Banks took seeds back to Kew Gardens during the latter half of the 18th century.Low, T., Wild Food Plants of Australia, Angus & Robertson, 1991, For two centuries, T. tetragonioides was the only cultivated vegetable to have originated from Australia and New Zealand.

The tips of the spinach can be pinched off and eaten raw or cooked. Nutrition When consumed after boiling, New Zealand spinach is 95% water, 2% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat, while supplying only 12 calories (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, the spinach is particularly rich in vitamin K, providing 278% of the Daily Value (DV).

Fabricius was born in Bandung, Java. He wrote approximately 60 books, among them many books for children, including De Scheepsjongens van Bontekoe (1924), which was reprinted 28 times as of 2003.Full text of De scheepsjongens van Bontekoe Biography Johan Fabricius was born in Bandung, Dutch East Indies, to Jan Fabricius and Minke Dornseiffen. His father was a journalist and playwright, which facilitated Johan's entry into the arts. He was a tall man, and had an aptitude for various arts. Until the age of fourteen he spent most of his time in the Dutch East Indies (ten years in all) and would return for brief visits throughout his life, maintaining a strong connection to the area. His schooling was varied; he was educated in different places in the Indies and the Netherlands, and briefly in Paris, and in the fall of 1914 he enrolled in the Hogere Burgerschool in The Hague, but soon left for the Academie van Beeldende Kunsten, where he showed a great talent for portraits, later illustrating his own books. The success of the series \\"\\", a series of five books advertising for the Nederlandsche Oliefabrieken (since 1928 part of Unilever), was due in part to his illustrations. In 1925 he married Ruth Freudenburg, and they had three children. After his years in The Hague, Fabricius joined the Austrian army as a war painter. He spent a few months on the Pavia front, where mostly Bosnian soldiers were engaged with Italian troops. Some of his letters home were published in the literary magazine De Gids. In 1922 he managed to get Eiko van den Reigerhof, his first novel, published; it had been written a few years earlier. By that time Fabricius was trying his hand as an illustrator, painter, stage actor, and costume designer. Following in his father's footsteps he wrote plays, some of which were actually staged. His breakthrough as a writer was Het meisje met de blauwe hoed, a humorous novel about a soldier's life based on his experiences in the military. The book was a commercial success, and was adapted for a movie in 1934; in 1974 it was adapted to a musical for television. His De scheepsjongens van Bontekoe (1934) was to become his best-known book; based on the real-life experiences of a 17th-century Dutch captain, Willem Bontekoe, who was shipwrecked on the way to the Indies, it became a best-seller after a slow start. The three fictional characters who set sail with Bontekoe allowed for easy identification for a young audience; a statues of the three is in the harbor of Hoorn since 1968. This book was tuned into a national award-winning feature film in 2007. Having sold an estimated 300,000 copies, the 34th edition was published in 2016. In between work Fabricius traveled widely. In 1922 already he had visited Argentina and Paraguay. His honeymoon was a one- year long journey along the shores of the Mediterranean, and he lived in Vienna and Capri. A journey around the world in 1936 brought him back to the Indies. His experiences and impressions formed the foundation for many of his novels, which combined drama with exoticism and unusual characters, in a relaxed style full of humor and anecdotes. The 1930s found Fabricius at the height of popularity and creativity; he produced a best-selling picaresque trilogy set in 18th-century Italy, Komedianten trokken voorbij (1931, winner of the C.W. van der Hoogt award), Melodie der verten (1932), and De dans om de galg (1934). When World War II broke out, Fabricius was living in Antwerp with his family, and fled to England by way of Saint-Malo. In London he worked for the Dutch news department of the BBC, first as a news reader and then as a free-lance correspondent. In the spring of 1945 he was sent to Asia as a correspondent for The Times and the BBC, hoping to witness the liberation of the Indies. In September 1945 he flew from Singapore to Batavia, and was one of the first foreign correspondents there. His recollections of a country ravaged by war and revolution were published in 1947 as Hoe ik Indi√´ terugvond. At the end of 1945 he left, moving to the United Kingdom by way of French Indo-China, Japan, and the United States. He lived in the UK until he moved permanently to the Netherlands in 1956. His wife died in 1968 and that same year he married Anna Cornelia Bleeker. He continued to travel and wrote at least one book a year until his death. By now his novels were frequently set in the Dutch Indies, with local subject matter. Much of his work was reprinted and translated, particularly for the US and UK markets. According to I. Sch√∂ffer, by 1945 Fabricius had reached his peak. Before the war already he was on the fringe of the Dutch literary world and changing tastes (among critics) in the post-war period led to an evaluation of Fabricius as a writer of merely popular literature. In addition, his stories were thought to contain mostly flat characters and lacked variation (and were written in a much too expansive a style), certainly once exoticism was no longer in vogue. He remained optimistic, though, and continued to write and publish until his death (in Glimmen, 21 June 1981), still maintaining a broad readership. He was buried at the cemetery in the neighboring village of Noordlaren.http://www.dodenakkers.nl/begraafplaatsen/groningen/360-noordlaren.html Vandals stole the beautiful bronze wind vane, depicting the Nieuw Hoorn, an early 17th-century Dutch East-Indies sailing vessel (featured in his 1923 novel), from his grave.

L√ºttwitz is best known for being the driving force behind the Kapp‚ÄìL√ºttwitz Putsch of 1920 which attempted to replace the democratic government of the Weimar Republic with a military dictatorship. Early life L√ºttwitz was born on 2 February 1859 in Bodland near Kreuzburg O.S. in Upper Silesia, then part of Prussia (now Bogacica, Poland). His father was Ernst von L√ºttwitz (1823‚Äì92), an Oberf√∂rster (\\"head forest warden\\"), Hauptmann (captain) and Deichhauptmann (\\"overseer of dikes\\"). His mother was Cecile (1835‚Äì1910), the daughter of Heinrich Graf Strachwitz von Gro√ü-Zauche und Camminetz. Military career L√ºttwitz received his military training in 1878‚Äì87, finishing as an officer. He then attended the Kriegsakademie in 1887‚Äì90. Between 1890 and 1912 he served in various army commands. In 1912, L√ºttwitz was appointed Oberquartiermeister at the Gro√üer Generalstab (the German General Staff). Crownprince Wilhelm described him as: \\"mehr Truppenf√ºhrer als Armeechef, mehr Bl√ºcher als Gneisenau\\" (\\"more leader of men than army chief, more Bl√ºcher than Gneisenau\\"). During World War I, L√ºttwitz held several high military ranks. From 2 August to 26 September 1914, he was Chief of Staff of the 4th Army. He led the 33rd Division from 26 September 1914 to 28 June 1915 and the 2nd Guards Infantry Division from 29 June to 25 September. He led X Corps from 22 December 1915 to 20 August 1916 and participated in the Second Battle of Champagne. On 21 August 1916, he became Chief of Staff of the 5th Army (whose commander-in-chief was Prince Wilhelm) and managed to minimize the military fallout from the drain on resources of the Battle of Verdun. On 25 November 1916, L√ºttwitz was made commanding general of III Corps. Having received the order Pour le M√©rite on 24 August 1916, in March 1918 he was commanding general during the Spring Offensive near Saint-Quentin/La F√®re and for his actions received the \\"oak leaves\\" addition to this medal on 26 March 1918. In August 1918, L√ºttwitz became General der Infantrie. Post-war Walther von L√ºttwitz (centre) with Gustav Noske (right), c. 1920 After the armistice and the German Revolution in 1918, on 28 December the Rat der Volksbeauftragten, the provisional German government, appointed him commander- in-chief of the German military in Berlin and vicinity (Befehlshaber der Truppen in und um Berlin and Oberbefehlshaber in den Marken). Besides being in command of all the regular forces of the demobilizing Imperial Army in that region, he was also in charge of all the Freikorps in the area. He was called \\"Father of the Freikorps\\" as he relied heavily on these paramilitary units in late 1918 and early 1919 after the regular troops had turned out to be unreliable. In this function, he directed the suppression of the Spartakus Uprising by the Freikorps in January 1919 under the orders of Minister of Defence Gustav Noske. In March 1919, L√ºttwitz' position was renamed Oberbefehlshaber des Reichswehr-Gruppenkommandos 1. In May 1919, the government named him as supreme commander of all military troops of the Reich in case of an emergency or war. However, even at that time, L√ºttwitz was making political demands outside the area of responsibility of a military commander, like outlawing strikes and abolishing unemployment insurance. Kapp‚ÄìL√ºttwitz Putsch Like many members of the Reichswehr, L√ºttwitz was an outspoken opponent of the Treaty of Versailles that was signed in June 1919. He was concerned that the treaty's stipulations could cause the army to disintegrate during its period of re-organisation and he especially disliked the treaty articles that demanded the reduction of the army to 100,000 men, disbandment of the Freikorps, and the extradition of about 900 men whom the Allies accused of war crimes. He planned to defy these stipulations of the treaty. As early as July 1919, L√ºttwitz was involved in plots to topple the Weimar Republic and replace the government of Friedrich Ebert with a military dictatorship. On 29 February 1920, Defence Minister Noske ordered the disbandment of two of the most powerful Freikorps, the Marinebrigade Loewenfeld and the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt. The commander of the latter, Korvettenkapit√§n Hermann Ehrhardt, declared that the unit would refuse to disband. On 30 February, it staged a parade without inviting Noske. L√ºttwitz said at the parade that he would \\"not accept\\" the loss of such an important unit. Several of L√ºttwitz's officers were horrified at this open rejection of the government's authority and tried to mediate by setting up a meeting between von L√ºttwitz and the leaders of the two major right-wing parties. L√ºttwitz listened to and remembered their ideas, but was not dissuaded from his course of action. Noske then removed the Marinebrigade from L√ºttwitz's command. L√ºttwitz ignored the order, but agreed to a meeting with President Ebert suggested by his staff. On the evening of 10 March, L√ºttwitz came with his staff to Ebert's office. Ebert had also asked Noske to attend. L√ºttwitz, drawing on demands by the right-wing parties and adding his own, now demanded the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly, new elections for the Reichstag, the appointment of technocrats (Fachminister) as Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, Economics and Finance, the dismissal of General Walther Reinhardt as Chef der Heeresleitung, his own appointment as supreme commander of the regular military and the revocation of the orders of dissolution for the Marinebrigaden. Ebert and Noske rejected these demands. Noske told L√ºttwitz that he expected his resignation the next day. Instead of resigning, L√ºttwitz went to D√∂beritz on 11 March and asked Ehrhardt whether he would be able to occupy Berlin that very evening. Ehrhardt said he needed another day, but in the morning of 13 March he could be in the centre of Berlin with his men. L√ºttwitz gave the order, and Ehrhardt began his preparations. It was only at this point that L√ºttwitz brought the group known as Nationale Vereinigung into the plot. These included DNVP member Wolfgang Kapp, retired General Erich Ludendorff, as well as Waldemar Pabst and , the last Berlin head of police in the old Reich. Their goal was to establish an authoritarian regime (though not a monarchy) with a return to the federal structure of the Empire. L√ºttwitz asked them to be ready to take over the government on 13 March. L√ºttwitz had not been dismissed, but only suspended from his post on 11 March. On the morning of 13 March, the Marinebrigade reached the Brandenburger Tor, where it was met by L√ºttwitz, Ludendorff, Kapp and their followers. Shortly thereafter, the putschists moved into the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei). Supported by a battalion of the regular Reichswehr, they occupied the government quarter. Kapp declared himself Chancellor (Reichskanzler) and formed a provisional government. L√ºttwitz served as commander of the armed forces and Minister of Defence. Although the putsch received support from military commanders and other conservative and monarchistic groups around the Reich, the rank and file of the bureaucracy mostly refused to cooperate. A general strike, called by the legitimate government, the unions and the parties of the left paralyzed the country and made it impossible for Kapp to govern. After negotiations with those members of the legitimate government who had remained in Berlin, Kapp resigned on 17 March, but L√ºttwitz tried to hold on for another day as head of a military dictatorship. When L√ºttwitz offered his resignation on 18 March, Vice-Chancellor Eugen Schiffer accepted‚Äîgranting him full pension rights. Schiffer also suggested L√ºttwitz should leave the country until the National Assembly had decided on the question of an amnesty and even offered him a false passport and money. Later life After the collapse of the putsch, L√ºttwitz first went to Saxony and only later left for Hungary. He used a passport provided by supporters in the Berlin police department. L√ºttwitz returned to Germany after an amnesty in 1924. He went back to Silesia and supported the DNVP but was not politically active. In 1931, he called for the creation of the Harzburger Front and in 1933 congratulated Wilhelm Frick on the successful Machtergreifung (take-over) by the NSDAP. His book, Im Kampf gegen die November-Republik was published in 1934. Personal life L√ºttwitz was married twice. In 1884 at Nimkau, he married Louise (1864‚Äì1918), daughter of the Austrian Hauptmann Viktor Graf von Wengersky and Eleonore Gr√§fin Haller von Hallerstein. In 1921 at Salzburg, he married Adelheid (1869‚Äì1956), daughter of Johann Freiherr Sardagna von Meanberg und Hohenstein and Irma von Dorner. With Louise, L√ºttwitz had three daughters and a son. His son was Smilo Freiherr von L√ºttwitz. His daughter Maria married Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord. L√ºttwitz died on 20 September 1942 in Breslau.

Analysis can be conducted by spectroscopy or by chromatography. The use of chiral derivatizing agents has declined with the popularization of chiral HPLC. Besides analysis, chiral derivatization is also used for chiral resolution, the actual physical separation of the enantiomers. History Since NMR spectroscopy has been available to chemists, there have been numerous studies on the applications of this technique. One of these noted the difference in the chemical shift (i.e. the distance between the peaks) of two diastereomers. Conversely, two compounds that are enantiomers have the same NMR spectral properties. It was reasoned that if a mix of enantiomers could be converted into a mix of diastereomers by bonding them to another chemical that was itself chiral, it would be possible to distinguish this new mixture using NMR, and therefore learn about the original enantiomeric mixture. The first popular example of this technique was published in 1969 by Harry S. Mosher. The chiral agent used was a single enantiomer of MTPA (Œ±-methoxy-Œ±-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid), also known as Mosher's acid. The corresponding acid chloride is also known as Mosher's acid chloride, and the resultant diastereomeric esters are known as Mosher's esters. Another system is Pirkle's Alcohol developed in 1977. Requirements The general use and design of CDAs obey the following rules so that the CDA can effectively determine the stereochemistry of an analyte: # The CDA must be enatiomerically pure, or (less satisfactorily) its enantiomeric purity must be accurately known. #The reaction of the CDA with both enantiomers should go to completion under reaction conditions. This acts to avoid enrichment or depletion of one enantiomer of the analyte by kinetic resolution. # CDA must not racemize under derivatization or analysis conditions. Its attachment should be mild enough so that the substrate does not racemize either. If analysis is completed by HPLC, the CDA must contain a chromophore to enhance detectability. # If analysis is completed by NMR, the CDA should have a functional group that gives a singlet in the resultant NMR spectrum, where the singlet must be remote from other peaks. Mosher‚Äôs Method Mosher's acid, via its acid chloride derivative, reacts readily with alcohols and amines to give esters and amides, respectively. The lack of an alpha-proton on the acid prevents loss of stereochemical fidelity under the reaction conditions. Thus, using an enantiomerically pure Mosher's acid allows for determination of the configuration of simple chiral amines and alcohols. For example, the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of 1-phenylethanol react with (S)-Mosher acid chloride to yield (R,S)- and (S,S)-diastereomers, respectively, that are distinguishable in NMR. CFNA (alternative to Mosher‚Äôs acid) A newer chiral derivatizing agent (CDA), Œ±-cyano-Œ±-fluoro (2-naphthyl)-acetic acid (2-CFNA) was prepared in optically pure form by the chiral HPLC separation of a racemic 2-CFNA methyl ester. This ester was obtained by fluorination of methyl Œ±-cyano (2-naphthyl) acetate with FClO3. 2-CFNA has been shown to be a superior CDA than Mosher‚Äôs agent to determine the enantiomeric excess of a primary alcohol. Chromatography Using CDAs Amide on silica used as the model compound for Helmchen's Postulates. Upon reaction of a CDA with the target analyte, chromatography can be used to separate the resulting products. In general, chromatography can be used to separate chiral compounds to bypass difficult crystallizations and/or to collect all diastereomer pairs in solution. Chromatography also has many variations (e.g. HPLC, Gas Chromatography, flash chromatography) with a wide array of applicability to diverse categories of molecules. The ability for CDAs to separate chiral molecules is dependent on two major mechanisms of chromatography: #Differential solvation in the mobile phase #Differential adsorption to the stationary phase =Helmchen's Postulates= Helmchen's Postulates are the theoretical models used to predict the elution order and extent of separation of diastereomers (including those formed from CDAs) that are adsorbed onto a surface. Although Helmchen‚Äôs postulates are specific for amides on silica gel using liquid chromatography, the postulates provide fundamental guidelines for other molecules. Helmchen‚Äôs Postulates are: #Conformations are the same is a in solution and when adsorbed. #Diastereomers bind to surfaces (silica gel in normal phase chromatography) mainly with hydrogen bonding. #Significant resolution of diastereomers is only expected when molecules can adsorb to silica through two contact points (two hydrogen bonds). This interaction can be perturbed by substituents. #Diastereomers with bulky substituents on the alpha carbon (R2) and on the nitrogen (R1) can shield the hydrogen bonding with the surface, thus the molecule will be eluted before similar molecules with smaller substituents. Helmchen‚Äôs postulates have been proven to be applicable to other functional groups such as: carbamates, esters, and epoxides. =Chiral stationary phases= Stationary phases can react with CDAs to form chiral stationary phases which can resolve chiral molecules. By reacting with alcohols on a silicate stationary phase, CDAs add a chiral center to the stationary phase, which allows for the separation of chiral molecules. CDAs in NMR spectroscopy CDAs are used with NMR spectroscopic analysis to determine enantiomeric excess and the absolute configuration of a substrate. Chiral discriminating agents are sometimes difficult to distinguish from chiral solvating agents (CSA) and some agents can be used as both. The speed of the exchange between the substrate and the metal center is the most important determining factor to differentiate between the use of a compound as a CDA or CSA. Generally, a CDA has a slow exchange whereas a CSA has a fast exchange. CDAs are more widely used than CSAs to determine absolute configurations because the covalent bonding to the substrate and auxiliary reagent produce species with greater conformational rigidity which creates greater differences in the NMR spectra. CDAs and CSAs can be used together to improve chiral recognition, although this is not a common. =Primary concerns when using CDAs= The primary concerns to take into consideration when using a CDA in NMR spectroscopy are kinetic resolution, racemization during the derivatization reaction and that the reagent should have 100% optical purity. Kinetic resolution is especially significant when determining optical purity, but it is somewhat negligible when the CDA is being used to assign the absolute configuration of an optically pure substrate. Kinetic resolution can be overcome using excess of the CDA. Racemization can occur to either the CDA or the substrate and in both cases it has the potential to significantly affect the results. =Strategies for NMR analysis= The two basic methods of NMR analysis are single- and double-derivatization. Double-derivatization is generally considered more accurate, but single-derivatization usually requires less reagents and, thus, is more cost effective. ; Single-derivatization methods: The NMR spectrum of the product formed from the reaction of the substrate with a CDA at room temperature is compared with one of the following: ; Double-derivatization methods: Either the enantiomer of the substrate is derivatized with two enantiomers of the CDA or both enantiomers of the substrate are derivatized with one enantiomer of the CDA. Two diastereomers form in both cases and the chemical shifts of their nuclei are evaluated to assign the configuration of the substrate. NMR techniques The most common NMR techniques used when discriminating chiral compounds are 1H-NMR, 19F-NMR and 13C-NMR. 1H-NMR is the primary technique used to assign absolute configuration. 19F-NMR is almost exclusive applied to optical purity studies, and 13C-NMR is primarily used to characterize substrates that do not have protons that are directly bonded to an asymmetrical carbon atom.

A Democrat, he represented Crown Heights, Flatbush, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, and Prospect Heights. A graduate of Medgar Evers College-with an MA in African-American Studies from SUNY-Albany-Andrews' first stint in public office came in 1981, when he sat on a community school board in the 17th District, Crown Heights. He's also served as a member of Community Board 8. Andrews has taught as an adjunct professor at both The College of New Rochelle and at his alma mater, Medgar Evers College. In addition, he has served as Attorney General Elliot Spitzer's Director of Intergovernmental Relations. In February 2002, Andrews ran for an open seat in the 20th State Senate district and won a special election to fill the vacancy left when Marty Markowitz won the race for Brooklyn Borough President in November 2001. Congressional campaign Andrews was one of four Democratic candidates vying to represent the 11th Congressional district of New York State in a hotly contested, volatile race. Even though he was endorsed by influential New York politicians, including Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, State Senator Carl Kruger, New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson, he was also subjected to criticism for his decision to remain in this race-thus potentially splintering the African-American vote in a divided primary-especially after another African-American candidate, Assemblyman Nick Perry, withdrew from the race in May. Carl Andrews was also the subject of criticism from some quarters for his close association with former chairman of the Kings County Democratic Party, and Assemblyman, Clarence Norman, who was forced to resign from his official positions as a result of his indictment and conviction on multiple felony counts of violating election law in late 2005. On August 14, 2006, Andrews received the endorsement of the New York State AFL-CIO. In order to receive the endorsement Andrews need the support of over two-thirds of the union membership, which union president Dennis Hughes stated Andrews had achieved. On September 12, 2006, Andrews was defeated in a four-way Democratic primary, garnering nearly 23% of the vote, and coming in third. Candidate debate Andrews participated in a debate broadcast by NY1 on August 24, 2006, stating that former Kings County Democratic Leader Clarence Norman \\"did some good things as county leader and some bad things as county leader\\". He also took highlighted several high-profile endorsements from leading members of the New York State Democratic Party, such as state Comptroller Alan Hevesi, and state Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Elliot Spitzer.

Plot On his son Georgie's 17th birthday, Andy LaMain is beaten with a cane by Al Judge, a crippled newspaperman. He does not fight back, confusing Georgie, who also wonders why his widower Dad's girlfriend Frances did not come to the birthday party. Georgie gets a gun and goes looking for Judge, first in a boxing arena where he is introduced to a Dr. Cooper. They go to a jazz club and soon Georgie gets to know Cooper's girlfriend, Julie, and sister, Marion, who kisses him but hides his gun. Finally finding Judge, he holds him at gunpoint and demands to know where Frances has gone. Judge explains that Frances was his sister and committed suicide because Georgie's father refused to marry her. A struggle for the gun ensues and Judge is shot. The police come to arrest Andy, believing him to be the shooter until Georgie confesses. The police reveal that Judge was not shot but only suffered powder burns.

History Tally sticks from Alp Blattiberg (Lauenen municipality), 1786/1815. Front: name of entitled person, reverse: notches for cow rights. For this alp, there are 87 cow rights divided among 23 owners. Lauenen is first mentioned in 1296 as an der Lowinon. Lauenen is known as an area with substantial danger of landslides and avalanches, which is the origin of its name (German Lawine \\"landslide,\\" from Latin labina \\"slide\\"). The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single Bronze Age artifact found at Feissenalp. Roman coins were found on the Wildhorn and near the village church. During much of the Middle Ages, Lauenen was part of the municipality and parish of Saanen. After years of negotiations, Lauenen became an independent parish in 1522 and finished building the parish church in 1524. When Bern accepted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation in 1528, Lauenen remained by the old faith. Finally, in 1556, the Reformation was introduced to this mountain village and they converted. Traditionally the villagers supported themselves by raising crops on the valley floor and raising cattle in seasonal alpine camps. In the 1800s the nearby community of Gstaad became an internationally known spa town. As tourists flocked to Gstaad, Lauenen became a destination as well and grew wealthy. Many of the richly decorated houses in the village were built with profits from the tourist industry. In the 1970s the tourist industry in Lauenen changed as visitors bought vacation chalets and villas. Geography Lauenen Lake surrounded by the Swiss Alps.

Early life Wilson was born in Birmingham, England, into a religious family. He later claimed that during his childhood he was visited by angels. Career Wilson travelled the world as a mariner, first visiting Canada in 1905. He studied world religions, preparing himself, by his own account, for a destiny that was revealed to him in a vision in the South of France in the autumn of 1924. He soon attracted a devoted following, including a group of wealthy and socially prominent individuals. Having taken the name Brother XII, he established the Aquarian Foundation in 1927. The group's beliefs were based largely upon the teachings of the Theosophical Society. He published two booklets, The Three Truths and Foundation Letters and Teachings, which explained his ideas and encouraged readers to donate money to his cause and to build homes in the colony, Cedar- by-the-Sea, which he was setting up near Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. With the goal of creating a self-sufficient community independent of the outside world, the Foundation acquired additional property on nearby Valdes and De Courcy Islands, largely through the donations of a wealthy socialite named Mary Connally from Asheville, North Carolina. Other followers gave donations, large and small, to support Brother XII's work as a spiritual teacher, as well as his political activity in support of a Democratic Senator from Alabama, James Thomas Heflin, who ultimately supported Herbert Hoover but was for a while a third-party candidate in the 1928 presidential election in the United States. An insurrection developed within the ranks of the colony when Brother XII's critics charged that he had claimed to be the reincarnation of the Egyptian god Osiris, though he replied that he had been speaking figuratively, that Osiris and Isis were male and female principles in Nature. Still, Brother XII's misuse of Foundation funds and his extramarital affair with a woman who he claimed was his soul-mate led to the breakup of the colony. The Aquarian Foundation was legally dissolved in 1929, though he continued his work with the followers who had remained loyal to him during the crisis, as well as a number of new recruits. As time passed, Brother XII became increasingly dictatorial and paranoid, fortifying his island kingdom and reportedly accumulating a fortune in gold. His mistress, Mabel Skottowe, n√©e Rowbotham (under the name \\"Madame Z\\"), worked the members without respite, the tasks given being considered tests of their fitness to advance spiritually. One man who had been imprisoned in a cellar on the northern end of Valdes Island managed to row to Nanaimo to report the circumstances to the British Columbia Provincial Police, who investigated, but took no further action. Eventually, as conditions deteriorated, Brother XII's core group of disciples revolted and filed legal actions against him to recover the money they had contributed to his work.Harrison, Victor Birch (1968). The Brother XII Affair (Speech). Nanaimo Historical Society Meeting. Nanaimo, B.C. Retrieved from VIUSpace. In a violent reaction, he destroyed the colony, smashing its buildings and farm equipment, and scuttling his flagship, the sailboat Lady Royal. Wilson and Skottowe then escaped in their private tugboat, the Kheunaten, rather than appear in court to answer the charges brought by their former disciples. By 1932 they had fled to Europe, and were reported to have taken a large amount of gold with them. Wilson is reported to have died in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, on 7 November 1934, though he may have fabricated his death. He may have subsequently met his lawyer in San Francisco, whose son has provided an eyewitness account of the meeting.

The foundation works to expand opportunities in America‚Äôs cities through grantmaking and investing in arts and culture, education, environment, health, human services and community development efforts. In 2013, the foundation's Board of Trustees approved 316 awards totaling $122 million; $128 million was paid out to grantees over the course of the year. Kresge's Social Investment Practice made another $17.7 million available to organizations whose efforts support foundation goals through program-related investments. Kresge has practiced strategic philanthropy since completing a historic transition that began in 2007. Long known for its exclusive use of the challenge grant to help local communities raise funds for major construction and renovation projects, it now employs an array of funding methods to address and advance a set of narrowly defined programmatic objectives. It awards grants and makes program-related investments. Some grants are awarded for a single year; others are for multiple years. Some of its programs accept applications on an ongoing basis. Others proactively invite or solicit applications. In January 2013, the foundation pledged $150 million to aid in the implementation of a long-ranging, comprehensive framework for Detroit's future, also known as The Detroit Future City plan. Since July 1, 2006, the foundation has been led by Rip Rapson, formerly of the McKnight Foundation. He succeeded John Marshall III as president and CEO. The foundation's beginnings In 1924, with an initial gift of $1.6 million, Sebastian Kresge established The Kresge Foundation in Detroit. Twelve years earlier, he and partner John G. McCrory opened the first 5-and-10-cent store, and parlayed the concept and operations into a chain of stores that were incorporated as the S.S. Kresge Company.

He was born in Skirpenbeck, near York and attended Pocklington School from 1936 to 1943. He began a degree course in engineering at Cambridge, but dropped out in 1944. In 1948 he returned to university after national service, reading Geology at the University of Bristol. On graduation, he join the research group of Professor Stanley Westoll at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, working on the fossil reptiles of the Late Triassic found in Elgin. He was appointed Lecturer in Geology in 1954, while working on his PhD. The bony remains of the Elgin reptile fossils were poor, sometimes just indentations in rocks. Walker devised a new casting method to capture the anatomical information in these fossils, using PVC; many of the resulting casts are now in the National Museum of Scotland and the Natural History Museum. His early work was also notable for reclassifying and naming the English theropod dinosaurs Eustreptospondylus and Metriacanthosaurus. In the late 1960s Walker studied the origin of crocodilians and of birds, which became controversial in 1972 with his publication of a paper in Nature arguing for a close relationship between sphenosuchian crocodylomorphs and birds. He later accepted that this hypothesis might be incorrect in a 1985 paper on Archaeopteryx.  Selected publications  * Walker AD. 1964.

Biography Bartak was the full-time organist for the NCAA Division I College World Series at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. He played full-time for the series from 1983 through his retirement in 2010. He had first played the organ for the event in 1955. Bartak also played the organ for the minor league Omaha Royals from 1973 to 2002. Bartak performed in one of the few stadiums that still featured live music, as most stadiums had switched to prerecorded music. His image was often shown on the video screens at Rosenblatt and on broadcasts of the games. Bartak is one of three organists to be ejected from a baseball game, the others being Wilbur Snapp in 1985 and Derek Dye in 2012. During an Omaha Royals game on May 26, 1988, Royals catcher Larry Owen argued a call with home plate umpire √Ångel Hernandez. Manager Glenn Ezell joined the fray and, during the argument, Bartak played the theme song from The Mickey Mouse Club. After Bartak played the spelling portion of the song, \\"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O- U-S-E\\", another umpire, Tony Maners, motioned to the press box ejecting Bartak. Coincidentally, Maners later umpired during the 2006 College World Series. Bartak retired following the 2010 College World Series, ending his career with the ballpark he loved, Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium. TD Ameritrade Park, when it opened in 2011, ushered in the era of Lincoln, Nebraska, native Jerry Pawlak as Bartak's successor at the organ. The original organ that Bartak played at Rosenblatt has been restored and is being used at TD Ameritrade Park. Bartak was born in Clarkson, Nebraska, in 1919. His father was a Czech immigrant to he United States. Bartak served in the United States Army during World War II, playing in a military band. He died in San Diego at the age of 94 in 2013.

It is a forum based on the recognition that there is close link between peace, security and stability in Asia and in the rest of the world. The key idea of the Conference is based on the priority of the indivisibility of security, joint initiative and mutually beneficial interaction of small and large states. The idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev on 5 October 1992, at the 47th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. On October 5, 2017, the CICA process celebrated its 25th anniversary.  Background  The proposal for convening the CICA was welcomed by a number of Asian States. During the next seven years, a series of meetings were held among the interested countries to discuss modalities of convening the CICA and draft basic documents. The first meeting of the CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs was held on 14 September 1999 with participation of 15 Member States. The Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States was adopted at this meeting. The first CICA summit was held on 4 June 2002 with participation of 16 Member States and Almaty Act, the charter of the CICA, was adopted. The impetus for this meeting came from the 9-11 terrorist attacks of the previous year. Thus, counter-terrorism became an important issue for CICA, and this theme has run through the subsequent meetings. At the second meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs in 2004, CICA Catalogue of Confidence- Building Measures and CICA Rules of Procedures were adopted. At the second CICA Summit in 2006, it was decided to admit Thailand and Republic of Korea as new members and to establish a permanent secretariat. At the third meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in 2008, Jordan and UAE were admitted as new members. At the third CICA Summit in 2010, Turkey assumed Chairmanship of CICA from the founding Chairman Kazakhstan. The third Summit also admitted Iraq and Vietnam as new members and adopted the CICA Convention. Bahrain and Cambodia joined CICA in 2011, and Bangladesh and Qatar joined in 2014, Sri Lanka in 2018 bringing the number of member states to 27.

Representatives of the then Observer States: USA, Japan, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Ukraine, and International Organizations like UN and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) also participated in the meeting. The First Ministerial Meeting laid the foundation of CICA with the signing of the Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States by the Ministers. The Ministers, while reaffirming commitment to the United Nations Charter, agreed that the Member states will respect each other's sovereign equality; refrain from the threat or use of force; respect the territorial integrity of each other; settle disputes in accordance with the Declaration, UN Charter and international law; refrain from any intervention in the internal affairs of each other; reaffirm their commitment to the goal of achieving general and complete disarmament under effective control; enhance the process of economic, social and cultural cooperation; and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals.  2002 summit  The first CICA summit was held in Almaty on June 4, 2002. The idea was proposed by Kazakhstan at the end of the Cold War and at the time of shifting geopolitics, provided a timely opportunity for the Asian nations to address modern challenges to the international peace and stability and set out the vision to tackle them. The fledgling forum's main purpose of bringing peace to all, including bringing together seemingly irreconcilable countries and interests, was immediately put to a real life test. The CICA Summit drew spotlight of the world's attention to Almaty, provided the background for laying the foundations for the first security organization in Asia. The 16 nations signed the Almaty Act, the Charter of the CICA and pledging to work \\"towards promoting peace, security and stability in Asia\\". The Act was signed by Chairman of the Administration of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, President of China Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister of India Atal Behari Vajpayee, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev, President of Mongolia Natsagiin Bagabandi, President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, President of Russia Vladimir Putin, President of Turkey Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. Signatories from other CICA members included the prime ministers of Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, a deputy prime minister of Israel, as well as special high-level envoys from Egypt, Iran, and Palestine. Ten more nations, including the United States, were accorded observer status in the new forum, as also a number of international organizations, such as the UN, the OSCE and the Arab League. In the final Almaty Act, the 16 leaders said that the CICA process presents \\"new opportunities for cooperation, peace and security in Asia\\" and \\"will guide us towards a better future, which our peoples deserve\\". They declared their \\"determination to form in Asia a common and indivisible area of security, where all states peacefully coexist, and their peoples live in conditions of peace, freedom and prosperity, and confident that peace, security and development complement, sustain and reinforce each other.\\" The leaders agreed to hold summits every four years, while the foreign ministers are to meet every two years. There are also provisions allowing for special meetings and summits to be convened at the consensus at other times. The committee of senior officials will keep up the organizational work and will meet annually. In another major development, the leaders adopted the CICA Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue among Civilizations, condemning \\"all forms and manifestations of terrorism, committed no matter when, where or by whom,\\" and declaring their commitment to cooperation with each other and other nations in combating terrorism.  2004 ministerial meeting  The second meeting of CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs was held in Almaty on October 22, 2004. At this meeting, CICA Catalogue of Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs), CICA Rules of Procedure and Declaration of CICA Ministerial Meeting were adopted. Thailand was admitted as the seventeenth member of CICA. CICA Rules of Procedure laid down ground rules for decision making, member ship, observer status, chairmanship, types of meetings and procedure for conducting meetings. One of the most important aspects of the Rules of Procedure is that decisions and recommendations at all levels are taken by consensus. Rules of Procedure were amended by a decision adopted on September 1, 2009. With this amendment, period of Chairmanship was reduced from four years to two years. It was also decided that the member state hosting regular Summit would be Chairman till the next regular meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

The zoo houses about 200 vertebrates and hundreds of invertebrates, representing about 54 different species on .  History  Sequoia Park Zoo was founded in 1907 and is the oldest zoo in California. The zoo is located on the land of the native tribe of the Wiyot people, who are a federally recognized tribe in California with over 600 members. The city of Eureka, where the zoo is located, is a city in Humboldt Bay, where the Wiyot tribe has lived for thousands of years. Since 1907, the zoo has housed an array of animals including large hoof-stock, exotic birds, and small mammals. The zoo achieved accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) in 1995. Since accreditation the zoo has prioritized conservation, including Species Survival Plan breeding programs and education programs. After 100 years of free entry, the zoo started charging admission in the summer of 2008. The zoo is partially supported by a foundation which operates a gift shop, cafe and zoo facility for rentals in addition to fundraising and community outreach.

The Sequoia Park Zoo has now received top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) 2016 award for Exhibit Design (within zoos operating with a budget under $5 million) for watershed heroes.  Controversy  In 1982, Sequoia Park Zoo was home to a family of four black bears, two parents, and their two offspring. The bears lived in an old-fashioned metal bar exhibit. The local community raised money to build a modern bear exhibit. During the construction of the new exhibit, the two bear cubs were sent to live at the Woodland Wildlife Park in Cave Junction, Oregon. The two adult bears were euthanized. Public reaction to the bears being euthanized was extremely negative with protesters quickly gathering and picketing in front of the zoo, and a petition calling for the zoo's closure gathered 5,000 signatures in the local community of 24,000. The incident received national media coverage. The zoo's director was subsequently replaced. In 2012, the zoo faced steep criticism because of its budget. The zoo's budget had doubled in size since 2002 while other departments within the City of Eureka had faced multimillion-dollar budget cuts in the same period of time. Closure of the zoo was proposed by multiple local media sources and by prominent local politicians.

Cyclin B is a mitotic cyclin. The amount of cyclin B (which binds to Cdk1) and the activity of the cyclin B-Cdk complex rise through the cell cycle until mitosis, where they fall abruptly due to degradation of cyclin B (Cdk1 is constitutively present). The complex of Cdk and cyclin B is called maturation promoting factor or mitosis promoting factor (MPF). Expression of cyclins through the cell cycle.  Function  Cyclin B is necessary for the progression of the cells into and out of M phase of the cell cycle. At the end of S phase the phosphatase cdc25c dephosphorylates tyrosine15 and this activates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Upon activation the complex is shuttled to the nucleus where it serves to trigger for entry into mitosis. However, if DNA damage is detected alternative proteins are activated which results in the inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc25c and therefore cyclinB/CDK1 is not activated. In order for the cell to progress out of mitosis, the degradation of cyclin B is necessary. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex also interacts with a variety of other key proteins and pathways which regulate cell growth and progression of mitosis. Cross-talk between many of these pathways links cyclin B levels indirectly to induction of apoptosis. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex plays a critical role in the expression of the survival signal survivin. Survivin is necessary for proper creation of the mitotic spindle which strongly affects cell viability, therefore when cyclin B levels are disrupted cells experience difficulty polarizing. A decrease in survivin levels and the associated mitotic disarray triggers apoptosis via caspase 3 mediated pathway.  Role in Cancer  Cyclin B plays in integral role in many types of cancer. Hyperplasia (uncontrolled cell growth) is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Because cyclin B is necessary for cells to enter mitosis and therefore necessary for cell division, cyclin B levels are often de-regulated in tumors. When cyclin B levels are elevated, cells can enter M phase prematurely and strict control over cell division is lost, which is a favorable condition for cancer development. On the other hand, if cyclin B levels are depleted the cyclin B/CDK1 complex cannot form, cells cannot enter M phase and cell division slows down. Some anti-cancer therapies have been designed to prevent cyclin B/CDK1 complex formation in cancer cells to slow or prevent cell division. Most of these methods have targeted the CDK1 subunit, but there is an emerging interest in the oncology field to target cyclin B as well. = As a Biomarker = Cyclin levels can easily be determined through immunohistological analysis of tumor biopsies. The fact that cyclin B is often disregulated in cancer cells makes cyclin B an attractive biomarker. Many studies have been performed to examine cyclin levels in tumors, and it has been shown that levels of cyclin B is a strong indicator of prognosis in many types of cancer. Generally, elevated levels of cyclin B are indicative of more aggressive cancers and a poor prognosis. Immunohistologically assessed levels of cyclin B could determine if women with stage 1, node negative, hormone receptor positive breast cancer were likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. In general women with this cancer have a very good prognosis, with mortality in 10 years of only 5%. Therefore, it is rare for oncologists to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases. However, in a small subset of patient this type of cancer is unexpectedly aggressive. These rare patients can be identified through their elevated cyclin B levels. In addition high levels of cyclin B also indicate poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis in gastric cancers. However, not all cancers which overexpress cyclin B are more aggressive. A study in 2009 found that cyclin B overexpression in ovarian cancer indicates that the cancer is unlikely to be malignant while more aggressive ovarian cancers of epithelial cell origin do not show elevated cyclin B. = Cyclin B and p53 = There is strong cross- talk between the pathways regulating cyclin B and the tumor suppressor gene p53. In general levels of p53 and cyclin B are negatively correlated. When p53 build-up triggers cell cycle arrest the levels of downstream proteins p21 and WAF1 are increased which prevents cyclinB/CDK1 complex activation and therefore progression through the cell cycle. It has also been observed that decreasing cyclin B levels in cells increases the levels of functional p53. Therefore, siRNAs for cyclin B may be an effective treatment against cancers where p53 function is inhibited but the gene has not been deleted. In such cases lowering cyclin B levels restores the tumor suppressing function of p53 and also prevents cancer cells from dividing as a consequence of low cyclin B.

The stages that a cell passes through that culminate in its division and replication are collectively known as the cell cycle Since the successful division and replication of a cell is essential for its survival, the cell cycle is tightly regulated by several components to ensure the efficient and error-free progression through the cell cycle. One such regulatory component is cyclin A which plays a role in the regulation of two different cell cycle stages. Types Cyclin A was first identified in 1983 in sea urchin embryos. Since its initial discovery, homologues of cyclin A have been identified in numerous eukaryotes including Drosophila, Xenopus, mice, and in humans but has not been found in lower eukaryotes like yeast. The protein exists in both an embryonic form and somatic form. A single cyclin A gene has been identified in Drosophila while Xenopus, mice and humans contain two distinct types of cyclin A: A1, the embryonic-specific form, and A2, the somatic form. Cyclin A1 is prevalently expressed during meiosis and early on in embryogenesis. Cyclin A2 is expressed in dividing somatic cells. Role in cell cycle progression Expression of human cyclins through the cell cycle Cyclin A, along with the other members of the cyclin family, regulates cell cycle progression through physically interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which thereby activates the enzymatic activity of its CDK partner. =CDK partner association= The interaction between the cyclin box, a region conserved across cyclins, and a region of the CDK, called the PSTAIRE, confers the foundation of the cyclin- CDK complex. Cyclin A is the only cyclin that regulates multiple steps of the cell cycle. Cyclin A can regulate multiple cell cycle steps because it associates with, and thereby activates, two distinct CDKs ‚Äì CDK2 and CDK1. Depending on which CDK partner cyclin A binds, the cell will continue through the S phase or it will transition from G2 to the M phase. Association of cyclin A with CDK2 is required for passage into S phase while association with CDK1 is required for entry into M phase. =S phase= Cyclin A resides in the nucleus during S phase where it is involved in the initiation and completion of DNA replication. As the cell passes from G1 into S phase, cyclin A associates with CDK2, replacing cyclin E. Cyclin E is responsible for initiating the assembly of the pre-replication complex. This complex makes chromatin capable of replication. When the amount of cyclin A/CDK2 complex reaches a threshold level, it terminates the assembly of the pre-replication complex made by cyclin E/CDK2. As the amount of Cyclin A/CDK2 complex increases, the complex initiates DNA replication. Cyclin A has a second function in S phase. In addition to initiating DNA synthesis, Cyclin A ensures that DNA is replicated once per cell cycle by preventing the assembly of additional replication complexes. This is thought to occur through the phosphorylation of particular DNA replication machinery components, such as CDC6, by the cyclin A/CDK2 complex. Since the action of cyclin A/CDK2 inhibits that of cyclin E/CDK2, the sequential activation of cyclin E followed by the activation of cyclin A is important and tightly regulated in S phase. =G2 / M phase= In late S phase, cyclin A can also associate with CDK1. Cyclin A remains associated with CDK1 from late S into late G2 phase when it is replaced by cyclin B. Cyclin A/CDK1 is thought to be involved in the activation and stabilization of cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Once cyclin B is activated, cyclin A is no longer needed and is subsequently degraded through the ubiquitin pathway. Degradation of cyclin A/CDK1 induces mitotic exit. Cyclin A/CDK2 complex was thought to be restricted to the nucleus and thus exclusively involved in S phase progression. New research has since debunked this assumption, shedding light on cyclin A/CDK2 migration to the centrosomes in late G2. Cyclin A binds to the mitotic spindle poles in the centrosome however, the mechanism by which the complex is shuttled to the centrosome is not well understood. It is suspected that the presence of cyclin A/CDK2 at the centrosomes may confer a means of regulating the movement of cyclin B/CDK1 to the centrosome and thus the timing of mitotic events. A study in 2008 provided further evidence of cyclin A/CDK2 complex's role in mitosis. Cells were modified so their CDK2 was inhibited and their cyclin A2 gene was knocked out. These mutants entered mitosis late due to a delayed activation of the cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Coupling of microtubule nucleation in the centrosome with mitotic events in the nucleus was lost in the cyclin A knockout/CDK2 inhibited mutant cells. Cyclin A has been shown to play a crucial role in the G2/M transition in Drosophila and Xenopus embryos. Regulation Transcription of cyclin A is tightly regulated and synchronized with cell cycle progression. Initiation of transcription of cyclin A is coordinated with passage of the R point, a critical transition point that is required for progression from G1 into S phase. Transcription peaks and plateaus mid-S phase and abruptly declines in late G2. =E2F and pRb= Transcription of cyclin A is predominantly regulated by the transcription factor E2F in a negative feedback loop. E2F is responsible for initiating the transcription of many critical S phase genes. Cyclin A transcription is off during most of G1 and the begins shortly after the R point. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is involved in the regulation of cyclin A through its interaction with E2F. It exists in two states: hypophosphorylated pRb and hyperphosphorylated pRb. Hypophosphorylated pRb binds E2F, which prevents transcription of cyclin A. The absence of cyclin A prior to the R point is due to the inhibition of E2F by hypophosphorylated pRb. After the cell passes through the R point, cyclin D/E- complexes phosphorylate pRb. Hyperphosphorylated pRb can no longer bind E2F, E2F is released and cyclin A genes, and other crucial genes for S phase, are transcribed. E2F initiates transcription of cyclin A by de-repressing the promoter. The promoter is bound by a repressor molecule called the cell-cycle- responsive element (CCRE). E2F binds to an E2F binding site on the CCRE, releasing the repressor from the promoter and allowing the transcription of cyclin A. Cyclin A/CDK2 will eventually phosphorylate E2F when cyclin A reaches a certain level, completing the negative feedback loop. Phosphorylation of E2F turns the transcription factor off, providing another level of controlling the transcription of cyclin A. =p53 and p21= Transcription of cyclin A is indirectly regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53. P53 is activated by DNA damage and turns on several downstream pathways, including cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest is carried out by the p53-pRb pathway. Activated p53 turns on genes for p21. P21 is a CDK inhibitor that binds to several cyclin/CDK complexes, including cyclin A-CDK2/1 and cyclin D/CDK4, and blocks the kinase activity of CDKs. Activated p21 can bind cyclin D/CDK4 and render it incapable of phosphorylating pRb. PRb remains hypophosphorylated and binds E2F. E2F is unable to activate the transcription of cyclins involved in cell cycle progression, such as cyclin A and the cell cycle is arrested at G1. Cell cycle arrest allows the cell to repair DNA damage before the cell divides and passes damaged DNA to daughter cells.

Expression of cyclins through the cell cycle. Functions of Cyclin E Like all cyclin family members, cyclin E forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2). Cyclin E/CDK2 regulates multiple cellular processes by phosphorylating numerous downstream proteins. Cyclin E/CDK2 plays a critical role in the G1 phase and in the G1-S phase transition. Cyclin E/CDK2 phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to promote G1 progression. Hyper- phosphorylated Rb will no longer interact with E2F transcriptional factor, thus release it to promote expression of genes that drive cells to S phase through G1 phase. Cyclin E/CDK2 also phosphorylates p27 and p21 during G1 and S phases, respectively. Smad3, a key mediator of TGF-Œ≤ pathway which inhibits cell cycle progression, can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/CDK2. The phosphorylation of Smad3 by cyclin E/CDK2 inhibits its transcriptional activity and ultimately facilitates cell cycle progression. CBP/p300 and E2F-5 are also substrates of cyclin E/CDK2. Phosphorylation of these two proteins stimulates the transcriptional events during cell cycle progression. Cyclin E/CDK2 can phosphorylate p220(NPAT) to promote histone gene transcription during cell cycle progression. Apart from the function in cell cycle progression, cyclin E/CDK2 plays a role in the centrosome cycle. This function is performed by phosphorylating nucleophosmin (NPM). Then NPM is released from binding to an unduplicated centrosome, thereby triggering duplication. CP110 is another cyclin E/CDK2 substrate which involves in centriole duplication and centrosome separation. Cyclin E/CDK2 has also been shown to regulate the apoptotic response to DNA damage via phosphorylation of FOXO1. Cyclin E and Cancer Over-expression of cyclin E correlates with tumorigenesis. It is involved in various types of cancers, including breast, colon, bladder, skin and lung cancer. DNA copy-number amplification of cyclin E1 is involved in brain cancer. Besides that, dysregulated cyclin E activity causes cell lineage-specific abnormalities, such as impaired maturation due to increased cell proliferation and apoptosis or senescence. Several mechanisms lead to the deregulated expression of cyclin E. In most cases, gene amplification causes the overexpression. Proteosome caused defected degradation is another mechanism. Loss-of-function mutations of FBXW7 were found in several cancer cells. FBXW7 encodes F-box proteins which target cyclin E for ubiquitination. Cyclin E overexpression can lead to G1 shortening, decrease in cell size or loss of serum requirement for proliferation. Dysregulation of cyclin E occurs in 18-22% of the breast cancers. Cyclin E is a prognostic marker in breast cancer, its altered expression increased with the increasing stage and grade of the tumor. Low molecular weight cyclin E isoforms have been shown to be of great pathogenetic and prognostic importance for breast cancer. These isoforms are resistant to CKIs, bind with CDK2 more efficiently and can stimulate the cell cycle progression more efficiently. They are proved to be a remarkable marker of the prognosis of early-stage-node negative breast cancer. Importantly, a recent research pointed out cyclin E overexpression is a mechanism of Trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients. Thus, co- treatment of trastuzumab with CDK2 inhibitors may be a valid strategy. Cyclin E overexpression is implicated in carcinomas at various sites along the gastrointestinal tract. Among these carcinomas, cyclin E appears to be more important in stomach and colon cancer. Cyclin E overexpression was found in 50-60% of gastric adenomas and adenocarcinomas. In ~10% of colorectal carcinomas, cyclin E gene amplification is found, sometimes together with CDK2 gene amplification. Cyclin E is also a useful prognostic marker for lung cancer. There is significant association between cyclin E over-expression and the prognosis of lung cancer. It is believed increased expression of cyclin E correlated with poorer prognosis.

The story of this \\"woman giant\\" began to spread rapidly after she went to see a doctor at the age of fifteen years for an illness. Medical doctors (who also saw her after years) properly diagnosed the illness but decided not to cure her, because her family did not have the 4000 yuan for the surgery.Discovery document, part of \\"My shocking story\\" film series. After that, many companies attempted to train her to be a sports star. The plans were abandoned, however, because Yao was too weak. Because she was illiterate, since 1992 Defen earned a living by traveling with her father and performing. Yao's giant stature was caused by a condition called acromegaly, wherein a large tumor in the pituitary gland of the brain releases too much growth hormone and causes excessive growth. Around 2002 a hospital in Guangdong removed the tumor. In 2009, the TLC cable TV network devoted a whole night's show to her. She fell in her home and had internal bleeding of the brain. She recovered and felt some happiness after a visit from China's tallest man, Zhang Juncai. Medical help A British television program filmed a documentary on her and helped raise money so she could get proper medical care. Two leading doctors in acromegaly agreed to help Yao. In that hospital, her growth hormone was greatly slowed, although it remained a problem. Upon her return home to her mother and brother, she was able to walk with crutches, unassisted by others, and was given a six-month supply of medicines and supplements in hopes of improving her condition enough to undergo surgery.

DJ \\"Mohawk\\" Adam brought industrial and dark electronic acts. Nation became recognized locally for highly diverse concert events. Nation was also recognized on a national and even international level for its three weekly DJ and theme driven nightclub parties. Due to its large size, The Capital Ballroom did host many top-selling musical acts during its four-year tenure, but it also had a sparse schedule, as the neighborhood, located in the area of Near Southeast in D.C., was notorious for its high crime rate in the mid-1990s. In 1999, The Capital Ballroom changed management and became known as Nation. Nation soon became very popular after another nearby dance club Tracks closed on November 6, 1999. Nation was managed by Primacy Companies, Inc. On July 17, 2006, the club closed after longtime lot owners Potomac Investment Properties decided to move forward with a planned office building on the site. In July 2007, Potomac Investment sold the site to Opus East for $41.5 million, and in spring 2008 construction began on the office building.Square 697/1015 Half Street/1000 South Capitol- Near Southeast DC Revitalization The area is now considered part of the \\"Ballpark District\\" due to the fact the Nationals Park stadium has been built two blocks away. As of January 2010, Opus East is insolvent and construction has been halted. Notable events Nation had been host to hundreds of bands and solo acts, from David Bowie to Rage Against the Machine. In 1996, the venue hosted the Warped Tour marking the only time the annual event was held indoors. It was originally scheduled to be held at Merriweather Post Pavilion. The venue also held the \\"Superbowl of Hardcore\\" a day-long concert featuring many of the top hardcore bands and punk bands. The final event at Nation featured Mindless Self Indulgence on July 17, 2006. Technical design and production staff at Nation included original Lighting Designer John Niederhauser (JSN Design), Lighting Director Kevin W Clark, Production Managers Joe \\"Shaggy\\" Conroy, Dylan Overstreet, and Stagehands \\"Seal\\", \\"Mouse\\", and \\"Gwydo\\" who ran lights for concerts. The main room was equipped with a stage, a large mezzanine walkway, and a third level skybox was added in 2000 for VIPs. The lighting fixtures in the main room consisted of 8 Studio Spots, 12 Studio colors, 72 par-cans, 6 lekos, 5 Studio 250s, and 6 MAC 500 moving heads; all controlled by a Hog 1000 with the pars and lekos going through a leprechaun dimmer rack. The main rig included a 15 1/2 foot diameter Truss Ring, with a 4-foot mirror ball hung in the center. Ring was hung on 4 chain motors, and one for the raising and lowering of mirror ball, running at 32 fpm. This allowed the ring and ball to travel the 35 ft height of the space, very quickly. Once the ring was at a preset height over the dance floor, by running the downstage motors up and the upstage motors down, the ring was tilted to a 50 degree angle in 4 beats. This truss move tilted the ring at 1 foot per second (64 fpm). Video was mixed and processed through an Edirol v-4 mixer and fed to the upstage, downstage, circular, and rectangular trusses for projection. The sound consisted of EAW cabinets and drivers, amplified by Crown, and fed by a post-processor in the DJ booth that received signal via a Pioneer 500 mixer or, if the talent on hand preferred something a little more \\"old-school\\", a Rane mixer. Front of house sound was managed by contracted third parties, usually Springfield Sound or MSI. Nation hosted a variety of events, such as concerts, sporting events, trade shows, and even a six-week run of The Rocky Horror Show. It was home to events such as \\"Alchemy/Alias\\" (Thursday), \\"Buzz (DC),\\" alternately \\"Sting\\" and \\"Cubik\\" after a brief move to Redwood Trust in Baltimore (Friday), and gay night \\"Velvet Nation\\" (Saturday). \\"Alchemy\\" was one of the country's weekly goth/industrial nights. Tony Tribby led a team that created Alchemy and used Nation's multi- room layout to combine music ranging from industrial, ebm, goth, 80s, punk, electro-clash, trance, alternative into a package with a Goth aesthetic. Alchemy had hosted VNV Nation, Icon of Coil, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Juno Reactor, Shiny Toy Guns and others at their Thursday night event, and put on annual events such as Goth Prom in the Spring and Freaks United every July 4.http://www.freaksuniteddc.com/ \\"Buzz (DC),\\" alternately \\"Sting\\" and \\"Cubik\\" hosted by Scott Henry and Lieven DeGeyndt, were named the country's top electronic dance music events numerous times by international publications such as Urb and BPM. Buzz/Sting and Cubik hosted the world's top electronic house, drum and bass, breakbeat and techno djs such as Paul Oakenfold, Ti√´sto, Sasha and Digweed, Dave Clarke, Dieselboy, Andy C, The Freestylers, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method and Paul Van Dyk as well as live acts such as Rabbit in the Moon and The Prodigy. Saturdays played host to Velvet Nation, a gay dance event. The event was respected as one of the top events of its kind in the US. For many years, circuit event DJs and talents such as Junior Vasquez, Abel Aguilera, Alyson Calagna, Mike Reeze, Manny Lehman, Susan Morabito, Tony Moran, Victor Calderone, The Pet Shop Boys, k.d. lang, and The Village People. Nation was also known for lavish theme parties, such as Madonnarama, a night of all Madonna music and video, The White Party, and a variety of Pride events.

The episode was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Janet Tamaro. It first aired on April 6, 2005, on ABC. While trying to make contact with the outside world from a plane discovered in the jungle tree canopy, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) is critically injured when the plane suddenly shifts and crashes to the ground, so Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) desperately tries to save his life. The flashbacks in this episode revolve around Jack's marriage to a former patient, Sarah (Julie Bowen). Plot =Flashbacks= Flashbacks show both the build-up to, and the event of Jack's wedding to Sarah, a former patient whom he \\"fixed\\" after she was injured in a car accident. Jack agonizes over his vows, and his father, Christian (John Terry) surprises him by showing up, giving Jack advice about writing the vows by the pool. His father says that Jack's strength is commitment, and that his problem is that he is \\"just not good at letting go.\\" Jack thinks over his father's words, and eventually writes his vows just in time for the ceremony, finally settling on extolling how Sarah has \\"fixed\\" him. =On the Island= Boone has been critically injured by his fall inside the Beechcraft in the previous episode. He has lost a lot of blood, one of his lungs has collapsed and his right leg is crushed. Jack sends Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) off to get some alcohol from James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway). On her way back, she discovers that Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) has gone into unexpected labour. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) surprises Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) with a \\"torchlit dinner\\". Shannon tells Sayid that Boone is only her step-brother, and that he is \\"kind of\\" in love with her. Boone needs a transfusion of type A-negative. Jack sends Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to find one of the other survivors with a matching blood type. When he unsuccessfully returns (only four people knew their blood type), Jack decides to give Boone some of his O-negative blood. Jack tries to use bamboo as a needle but can't pierce his skin. Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) solves the problem by providing a sea urchin. Using the urchin's spines, Jack begins to give Boone his blood. Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), while working on the new raft, hears Kate's call for help and rushes to her and Claire. Despite the language barrier, Kate is able to tell Jin to go and find Jack. Jin rushes to the caves but Jack is occupied with the blood transfusion. Jack tells Jin (with the aid of Sun translating) to take Charlie to Kate and Claire, and gives Charlie instructions for Kate on delivering the baby. As Jack begins to turn pale Sun stops the transfusion because the blood is pooling in Boone's dead right leg. Jack tries to save Boone's leg but it is beyond repair and Boone will die if it is not amputated. Jack asks Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) to find a way to cut off Boone's leg. Boone suddenly regains consciousness and tells Jack to just let him go. Boone reveals to Jack that he and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) discovered a mysterious hatch, and Locke told him not to tell anybody else. Boone says \\"Tell Shannon I ...\\" but dies without finishing the sentence. Claire gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Jack tells Shannon that Boone had died, Shannon immediately goes to the caves, and cries over Boone's dead body. Jack goes looking for Locke, thinking that Boone was murdered. Production In the original outline of the eleventh episode, Locke was to be accompanied by two guest characters to search for Claire and discover the Hatch.Grillo-Marxuach, Javier (October 24, 2006) \\"Writing Lost,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Retrieved on October 17, 2007. In the final product, Boone accompanied Locke, a choice that would lead to Boone's death. While the executive producers have stated that Somerhalder took the news of his character's death professionally, Somerhalder has said that he found it \\"pretty devastating.\\"Jensen, \\"Doc\\" Jeff, (April 6, 2005) \\"Lost to Us,\\" Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on August 5, 2007. Boone's death is notable as the first death of a major character on the series. According to executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Boone's death made sense from a story perspective to fuel the rivalry between Jack and Locke and lead to the events in the season finale.\\"Keveney, Bill, (April 7, 2006) \\"Death for Boone, Birth for Claire on Lost,\\" USA Today.

She was the daughter of the revivalist preacher and author Henry Grattan Guinness, a friend of James Hudson Taylor, founder of the CIM. She became Taylor's daughter-in-law when she married his son, fellow CIM missionary Frederick Howard Taylor. Single woman and missionary Mrs. Howard Taylor In her youth, Taylor taught a Bible class for \\"factory-girls\\" in Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London where they lived. She attended meetings at \\"Berger Hall\\" named after William Thomas Berger. She left London for China as a second-class passenger on the P&O vessel Kaisar-i-Hind IShipping lists date the building of the second Kaisar-i-Hind after 1888 and upon the sinking of the first. in January, 1888, age 22. The Hundred missionaries had all sailed to China the previous year. Among the 25 passengers (16 men, 5 ladies [sic]) aboard the steam ship with her were Miss Mary Reed (daughter of Mrs Henry Reed and sister of Mrs Harry Guinness), Mr and Mrs Hunt (travelling to Hanchung) and the Pigott family of The Sheo Yang Mission (who were eventually killed during the Boxer Rebellion). As recorded in In the Far East (1889), the Kaisar-i-Hind took a route passing Gibraltar (10:30pm, 31 January 1888), calling at Naples and then passing the Straits of Messina, stopping for a day at Aden and then onward to Colombo, Ceylon. At Colombo the missionary party boarded the P&O vessel S.S. Deccan, bound for Shanghai. A stop in Penang, Malaysia, allowed Geraldine a first contact with many Chinese who came on board. Then a stop at Singapore followed. Her first time on Chinese soil was later at a stop at Hong Kong where she was received by Dr and Mrs Chalmers of the London Missionary Society, who introduced them also to Mr and Mrs Bender of the Basel Mission. Shanghai was reached next. But Shanghai was not their final destination. Staying only long enough to exchange their European clothes for the national Chinese costume, the missionaries started on again, leaving this first station of the China Inland Mission behind them and travelling on the boat Fuh-ho (\\"Happy Harmony\\") in the substantially cheaper Chinese accommodations up the Yang-tsi River to Chinkiang. Lastly on to a barge some 6 hours to Yang-chau, finally arriving at Yang-chau on 23 March 1888. She wrote to her sister after a short time in China: After training in China, Geraldine was eventually stationed in Honan Province.

The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs, with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the semiconductor transducer. Arrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing. Their main advantage compared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not require labeling of molecules. Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge transport.

Website is . The Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) organizes and oversees a series of annual tournaments for the top competitive women ten-pin bowlers. The series is often referred to as the \\"women's tour\\" of bowling. The PWBA was formed in 1960 but ceased operations in 2003. The PWBA Tour was re-launched in 2015 by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) and Bowling Proprietors‚Äô Association of America (BPAA) with a three-year funding commitment. In addition, through a new partnership with the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), the PBA began conducting PWBA Regional (women-only) events and PWBA members are now allowed to bowl all PBA events. History PWBA and LPBT signs still visible July 2014 at the door of the longtime former home of the organizations, The Cherry Bowl in Rockford, IL. The PWBA was formed in 1960 by a group of professional women bowlers. After the organization struggled, some of the players left the PWBA in 1974 to form the Ladies' Professional Bowlers Association (LPBA). The two merged again in 1978, forming the Women's Professional Bowlers Association (WPBA). When the WPBA dissolved in 1981, bowling center proprietor John Summer of Rockford, Illinois, started the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour (LPBT), a private company, to continue the women's tour. The LPBT adopted the PWBA name and a new logo in 1998. In the fall of 2003, the PWBA Tour ceased operations before the completion of its 2003 season, primarily due to dwindling interest in sponsoring women's bowling. The Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) then acquired the rights and assets of the PWBA. This gave the WIBC control of the PWBA name, trademark, logo, website domain (pwba.com), as well as the PWBA's historical records. The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) acquired the PWBA when the WIBC merged with the American Bowling Congress (ABC), Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA) and USA Bowling in 2005. Without a PWBA Tour, women either retired from professional bowling, competed in the remaining women-only tournaments in the United States, or moved on to other bowling tournaments outside of the United States. Wendy Macpherson started competing in the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA) in 2004, going on to earn ten JPBA titles. In 2007, the Japan Bowling Congress (JBC) started the DHC Cup Girls Bowling International - at the time the third largest women's tournament in the world in prize money, just behind the U.S. Women's Open and the USBC Queens. Some women chose to bowl in professional men's tournaments. The Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) opened its membership to women in April 2004. PWBA members such as Kim Adler, Carolyn Dorin-Ballard, Liz Johnson, and Kelly Kulick became members of the PBA, with Kulick becoming the first female to earn an exemption on the PBA Tour (2005‚Äì06 season). Women have had limited success in PBA events. Missy Parkin was the first female PBA member and now holds three PBA Regional Titles. Johnson was the first woman to make a televised appearance on the PBA Tour, finishing runner-up to Tommy Jones at the 2005 PBA Banquet Open. Kulick became the first woman to win a national PBA tournament major with her defeat of Chris Barnes in the 2010 Tournament of Champions. Johnson became the second woman to win a national PBA tournament with her defeat of Anthony Pepe in the PBA Chameleon Championship at the 2017 World Series of Bowling. The USBC sponsored the PBA Women's Series starting with the 2007‚Äì08 season, allowing women PBA members to compete in a small number of events without their male counterparts. The final head-to-head match for that week's women's tournament would air in the same telecast as the PBA men's final round. The PBA Women's Series was discontinued after the 2009‚Äì10 season. The PBA created the PBA Women's Regional Tour program in 2014, in which women bowl with and against their male counterparts, but there are specific prizes and benefits for women only. In the media before 2015 Many PWBA events were nationally televised on the TVS Television Network (as the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour) under a five year contract in the 1980s. When TVS could not maintain payments, it worked with Tom Ficara of the Cable Sports Network to continue coverage. After that agreement expired, Ficara acquired the TVS Network but did not renew the LPBT deal. LPBT final rounds were then televised on ESPN and ESPN2 from the late 1980s up until 2003, when the association folded. From 2004-2006, the WIBC Queens event (renamed USBC Queens in 2005) was the only scheduled event for female bowlers that received TV coverage. For the autumn of 2007, the USBC acquired rights to the U.S. Women's Open. The event was televised for five Sundays on ESPN, with the action being called by PBA legends Nelson Burton Jr. and Marshall Holman. This event also served as the qualifier for the PBA Women's Series, a special four-stop mini-tour for the top 16 females. The finals for the mini-tour events were televised along with the regular PBA broadcasts for four Sundays on ESPN in November‚ÄìDecember, 2007. The U.S. Women's Open returned for five weeks in September‚ÄìOctober, 2008. The PBA Women's Series was expanded to eight events in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons but was then discontinued. Season-by-season breakdown =2015 PWBA rebirth= The PWBA Tour returned from a 12-year hiatus in 2015, thanks to a three-year funding commitment from the USBC and BPAA.
