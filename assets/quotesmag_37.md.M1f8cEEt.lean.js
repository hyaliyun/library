Local Taiwanese residents manually collect fuel oil after the \\"Amorgos\\" oil spill incident Cause On 14 January 2001, the Greek merchant vessel Amorgos, lost power while en route from India to North China. The carrier was transporting approximately 60,000 tons of iron ore and an estimated 1,000 to 1,150 tons of fuel oil when the ship suffered engine failure near Kenting National Park, off the southernmost tip of Taiwan. The crew subsequently abandoned the ship, and all 25 crew members were rescued by the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) of Taiwan. Due to deteriorating weather and sea conditions, the hull of the Amorgos split, and oil began to leak from the vessel beginning 18 January 2010. Spillage and ecological effects Approximately 1,300 tons of fuel oil leaked from the Amorgos into the sea surrounding Kenting National Park, causing major damage to the maritime and local environment. Kenting National Park is an ecological attraction that draws millions of tourists each year due to its warm climate and its many natural phenomena, including limestone caves, monsoon forests and coastal rainforests. Around 4 to 5 kilometers of the Kenting National Park shoreline was oiled by the spillage, creating a hazardous environment for the 200 bird species and estimated 2,200 plant species within the park. Park officials reported that contaminated coral and dead fish, crabs, shrimp, and clams have washed ashore. Delayed response There were many factors that contributed to the delayed response and subsequent clean-up efforts concerning the Amorgos incident. The spill took place about two months after the Marine Pollution Control Act (MPCA) of Taiwan was publicized. As a result, the spill occurred during a transitional period in which the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and its Salvage Council for Maritime Disasters was delegating its authority to the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). The jurisdiction among the MOTC, CGA, and the EPA was unclear; therefore, it took longer for the EPA to open an investigation into the spill, allowing more time for the oil to cover a larger area and lay waste to maritime and coastal species. The second factor was the observance of the Lunar New Year holidays, making it difficult for companies to hire local residents to clean up the mess. After the 5-day holiday, 40 local workers were hired in addition to 8000 soldiers commissioned to take part in the clean-up operations. The third factor was the severe weather conditions that hampered efforts to clean up the oil. As a result, clean-up was restricted to manual retrieval of oil using buckets, hand nets, and scoops. Clean-up timeline Of the 1,300 tons of fuel oil that was spilt, some has been lost due to natural dispersion and evaporation by means of severe weather and rough seas. The oil was later emulsified due to the wave patterns which subsequently increased the area and volume of the spill. Despite these occurrences, most of the oil reached the Lungkeng Ecological Preservation Area within the Kenting National Park. The affected shoreline consists of fossilized coral and various channels, making access to the oiled areas difficult. As a result, manual collection of oil was the only feasible option. Shoreline clean-up began on 25 January 2010, and lasted until about 14 February 2010, in which an estimated total of 300 tons of oil had been collected. Lawsuit and settlement The EPA later sued Assuranceforeningen Gard‚Äîthe Norwegian insurer of the Amorgos as a result of the damage caused by the oil spill. Instead, the EPA settled with Assuranceforeningen Gard in March 2006, resulting in the ship's owner agreeing to pay a total of NT$34 million ().

Complex I in yellow, Complex III in green, and Complex IV in purple. A, B, and E are side views of the complexes as they are oriented upright in the membrane. Horizontal lines on E indicate the position of the membrane. D is a view from the intermembrane space. C and F are viewed from inside the matrix. Modern biological research has revealed strong evidence that the enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain assemble into larger, supramolecular structures called supercomplexes, instead of the traditional fluid model of discrete enzymes dispersed in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These supercomplexes are functionally active and necessary for forming stable respiratory complexes. One supercomplex of complex I, III, and IV make up a unit known as a respirasome. Respirasomes have been found in a variety of species and tissues, including rat brain, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, bovine heart, human skin fibroblasts, fungi, plants, and C. elegans. History In 1955, biologists Britton Chance and G. R. Williams were the first to propose the idea that respiratory enzymes assemble into larger complexes, although the fluid state model remained the standard. However, as early as 1985, researchers had begun isolating Complex III/Complex IV supercomplexes from bacteria and yeast. Finally, in 2000 Hermann Sch√§gger and Kathy Pfeiffer used Blue Native PAGE to isolate bovine mitochondrial membrane proteins, showing Complex I, III, and IV arranged in supercomplexes. Composition and formation The most common supercomplexes observed are Complex I/III, Complex I/III/IV, and Complex III/IV. Most of Complex II is found in a free-floating form in both plant and animal mitochondria. Complex V can be found co-migrating as a dimer with other supercomplexes, but scarcely as part of the supercomplex unit. Supercomplex assembly appears to be dynamic and respiratory enzymes are able to alternate between participating in large respirasomes and existing in a free state. It is not known what triggers changes in complex assembly, but research has revealed that the formation of supercomplexes is heavily dependent upon the lipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane, and in particular requires the presence of cardiolipin, a unique mitochondrial lipid. In yeast mitochondria lacking cardiolipin, the number of enzymes forming respiratory supercomplexes was significantly reduced. According to Wenz et al. (2009), cardiolipin stabilizes the supercomplex formation by neutralizing the charges of lysine residues in the interaction domain of Complex III with Complex IV. In 2012, Bazan et al. was able to reconstitute trimer and tetramer Complex III/IV supercomplexes from purified complexes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and exogenous cardiolipin liposomes. Another hypothesis for respirasome formation is that membrane potential may initiate changes in the electrostatic/hydrophobic interactions mediating the assembly/disassembly of supercomplexes. Functional significance The functional significance of respirasomes is not entirely clear but more recent research is beginning to shed some light on their purpose. It has been hypothesized that the organization of respiratory enzymes into supercomplexes reduces oxidative damage and increases metabolism efficiency. Sch√§fer et al. (2006) demonstrated that supercomplexes comprising Complex IV had higher activities in Complex I and III, indicating that the presence of Complex IV modifies the conformation of the other complexes to enhance catalytic activity. Evidence has also been accumulated to show that the presence of respirasomes is necessary for the stability and function of Complex I. In 2013, Lapuente-Brun et al. demonstrated that supercomplex assembly is \\"dynamic and organizes electron flux to optimize the use of available substrates.\\" References Category:Cellular respiration Category:Integral membrane proteins ","title":"Supercomplex"},{"id":"41632850","text":"Herschel Davis Newsom (born May 1, 1905) was the 16th master of the National Grange (1950‚Äì1968), a foundation that promotes education, service and legislation in benefit of American farm families.

The company's headquarters are in Baar, Switzerland and Columbus, Ohio, United States. The name \\"Veeam\\" came from the phonetic pronunciation of the letters \\"VM\\" ‚Äî virtual machine. History Ratmir Timashev and Andrei Baronov founded Veeam in 2006. Timashev and Baronov had sold their previous IT management software company, Aelita Software Corporation, to Quest Software in 2004; Dell subsequently acquired Quest Software in 2012. In June 2016, Dell announced the sale of its software division, which included Quest, to Francisco Partners and Elliott Management Corporation. The first Veeam products, Veeam Monitor and Veeam Reporter, provided virtual-infrastructure monitoring, reporting, analysis and documentation. Later, in 2010, the company combined both products to form Veeam ONE. Veeam gained attention in 2007 with its free VM backup copy product, FastSCP, which became a basis for building Veeam's data-protection software for hardware virtualization. In 2014, Veeam held its first conference on data protection and availability called \\"VeeamON,\\" which took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2016, Veeam appointed Peter C. McKay, prior Senior Vice President and General Manager, Americas with VMware, as President/COO. In 2017, Peter McKay and Andrei Baronov were promoted to the company's Co-CEO roles. In late 2018, Andrei Baronov was promoted to CEO. The company has a number of international offices, including regional headquarters for EMEA in Paris, France, for the Americas in Columbus, Ohio, for the Middle East in Dubai and for the Asia-Pacific region in Sydney, Australia. On January 9, 2020, Insight Partners announced that they would purchase Veeam in a $5 billion deal and move the company to the US. On 22 July 2020, It has been reported that Gartner, Inc. has placed Veeam Software in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for Data Center Backup and Recovery Solutions Leaders.  Software  In 2008, with 10 employees, the company released Veeam Backup & Replication, a tool that provided VMware vSphere VMs with incremental backups and image-based replication, with built-in data deduplication and compression. Veeam Backup & Replication started supporting Microsoft Hyper-V in 2012. In 2015, the company extended its product line with a free backup utility for physical endpoints ‚Äî Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE; it supports PCs running 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows OS and integrates with Veeam Backup & Replication. In the same year, it released Veeam FastSCP for Microsoft Azure, a tool for copying files between on-premises and Microsoft Azure VMs. In 2016, it launched Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365, for backing up Office 365 Exchange servers, and Veeam Availability Orchestrator, a multi-hypervisor disaster recovery orchestration software with documenting, testing and reporting capabilities. In 2017, it introduced three new products: Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows and Veeam Agent for Linux ‚Äî for physical workload data protection with various backup/restore scenarios including cloud, and Veeam Availability Console ‚Äî a free tool for managing Veeam-powered data protection and disaster recovery in distributed infrastructures and enabling BaaS and DRaaS services delivered through service providers. Acquisitions In 2008, the company acquired nworks to further integrate VMware management with Microsoft and Hewlett- Packard enterprise system management platforms. This resulted in two new products: * Veeam nworks Management Pack for VMware to directly integrate VMware management into Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. * Veeam nworks Smart Plug-In for VMware to directly integrate VMware management into HP OpenView. In 2012, both products were renamed to Veeam Management Pack and Veeam Smart Plug-In, omitting the word \\"nworks.\\" In 2017, Veeam acquired N2WS, a company providing cloud-native enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery solutions for Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2019, Veeam sold N2WS back to its original founders after discussions with the US Government.

Following the seventh round, Jones seized control of the fight and won the remaining five rounds on the scorecards. In the tenth round, Jones scored another knockdown over Trinidad late in the round after landing a quick left‚Äìright hand combination, though Trinidad quickly got back up and survived the remainder of the fight.

He is included in the Hyakunin Isshu and was the nephew of Emperor Ichijo's wife, Empress Fujiwara no Teishi.  Career  Raised by his grandfather, Fujiwara no Michitaka, who died in 995. His father, Fujiwara no Korechika, was promoted to Minister of the Interior (Naidaijin) the following year, but following an incident in which an arrow was shot at Emperor Kazan, he was demoted to the post of governor of Dazai. Michimasa lived during the downfall of his family's fortunes. In 1004, at the age of 14, he was conferred with the rank of Junior fifth rank lower. In 1011, he became a servant of the future Emperor Ichijo. In 1015 he became Lieutenant of the Guard for the Left. In 1016, at the time of Emperor Ichijo's accession to the throne, he was promoted to lower third rank. However, he was dismissed 8 days after taking up his new post. Furthermore, in September of the same year, when escorting the Imperial Princess Masako to Ise to become the sacred maiden, their affair was made known to her father the Retired Emperor Sanjo, who censured Michimasa heavily. According to the Eiga monogatari, Masako took the tonsure before her father's death, but according to the Sh≈çy≈´ki (Â∞èÂè≥Ë®ò), she took the tonsure on November 13, 1017, six months after her father's death.McCallugh, Hellen C. (1980). A Tale of Flowering Fortunes: Annals of Japanese Aristocratic Life In the Heian Period, Volume 1, p. 455. On December 6, 1024, Emperor Kazan's daughter, J≈çtomo-In was murdered in the night and her body was discovered the following morning. The following year a suspect was caught; however, the suspect confessed that he killed her on Michimasa's orders. The following year 1026, with the case still undecided, Michimasa was demoted from his posts. In July 1054 he took the tonsure and died shortly after.Fujiwara no Sanesuke, Sh≈çy≈´ki (Â∞èÂè≥Ë®ò)  Life  Though he was described as a violent man in the Sh≈çy≈´ki, five of his poems were included in the Gosh≈´i Wakash≈´ and two were included in the Shika Wakash≈´, both Imperial anthologies. His poem included in the Hyakunin Isshu is commonly interpreted as Michimasa's response to being barred from visiting the Imperial Princess Masako after her father learned of their affair.Mostow, Joshua. (1996). Pictures of the Heart:The Hyakunin Isshu in Word and Image, p. 328. Michimasa's relationship with the former Ise Priestess is mentioned in the Eiga monogatari in several places. The narrator draws a parallel between Ariwara no Narihira's relationship with a serving Ise priestess and Michimasa and Masako's relationship. However, the narrator points out that as Masako was no longer serving it was not as great an offense.McCallugh, Hellen C. (1980).

Etymology  The name of this genus is a combination of the type species epithet minimus, with the genus it was originally assigned to, Pseudocryphaeus. * M. minimus was so-called for its small size compared to species of Pseudocryphaeus. * M. quaterspinosus is named after the fact that it has only four pairs of pygidial lappets.  Description  Frontal view with rostrum, note that the border is narrow in front of the glabella and a wide next to the eye The headshield (or cephalon) may have a spine sticking forward from its border. The most forward lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is diamond shaped. The eye has 5‚Äì8 lenses per vertical row (or dorso-ventral file). The spines at the back corners of the cephalon (genal spines) are shorter than glabella and narrow over the entire length. The border is not defined by a furrow, narrow at the front, but very wide at the sides of the cephalon and hardly defined on the genal spines. The tailshield (or pygidium) has 5 pleural segments in each of which the frontal pleural bands are as wide and elevated as the posterior bands, and both are flat. The axis has 7‚Äì10 rings. The 4 or 5 pairs of lateral pygidial spines (or lappets) are shorter than the area outside the axis (or pleural region) is wide, and they are mainly connected to the posterior pleural bands. The terminal pygidial spine slightly wider than axis, roughly triangular, twice as long as other pygidial spines.  Taxonomy  Pygidium of Minicryphaeus minimus, showing the lateral and terminal lappetsMinicryphaeus was split-off from Pseudocryphaeus. The main differences are that in Minicryphaeus the genal spines are about 75% of the length of the glabella, the spaces between the lateral pygidial lappets are V-shaped, and the terminal spine is triangular and longer than the other lappets. In Pseudocryphaeus the genal spines are about half as long as the glabella, the spaces between the lappets are U-shaped, and the terminal spine is pentangular.

Education Ausubel obtained his undergraduate degree in 1966 at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois. He received his Ph.D. in Biology in 1972 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Research Ausubel's scientific work concerns host-microbe interactions. In the 1970s and 1980s, his laboratory worked on the molecular basis of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the process by which legumes, in concert with a bacterial symbiont, convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. Over the last 20 years, Ausubel's lab has worked on the development of so-called multi-host pathogenesis systems that involve the infection of hosts, including the well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with a variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens. His research helped elucidate the innate immune signaling pathways in these two model hosts and determined which aspects of the innate immune response are conserved and whether they were derived by a process of divergent or convergent evolution. His laboratory currently uses the C. elegans pathogenesis model to study intestinal epithelial immunity and how hosts distinguish pathogens from beneficial commensal microorganisms. Related work in his laboratory concerns the identification and characterization of low molecular weight compounds that specifically activate C. elegans immune signaling pathways. His laboratory assembled an automated C. elegans sample preparation pipeline to enable high- throughput chemical screens using whole animals based on automated image analysis. As of 2013, Ausubel had published 215 refereed scientific articles. In addition to serving on a variety of editorial boards, Ausubel is founding editor of Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Ausubel was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1994, the American Academy of Microbiology in 2002 and also the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. Awards Ausubel received the 2014, Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal, for lifetime achievement in the field of genetics.

The publishing house was founded in 1969 by Gibbs M. Smith (1940‚Äì2017) and his wife Catherine. Its offerings include children's books, including the BabyLit line, cookbooks, home reference books, and the LoveLit gift line. It distributes the Lil' Libros line of bilingual board books. The Gibbs Smith Education division produces social studies textbooks and digital materials for schools. History The company began its existence in a one-room sculptor's studio in Santa Barbara, California. Smith used $12,000 earned from working on the film version of his master's dissertation on labor activist Joe Hill to finance his publishing venture, after receiving words of encouragement from publisher Alfred A. Knopf, Sr. By 1973, the company had moved to a barn built in 1916 in East Layton, Utah. When operations first began in the barn, company personnel only had access to the top portion of the barn, while the bottom of the barn hosted cows and chickens. The company was originally known as Peregrine Smith, before folding that name into one of its imprints and catalog lines. The company first entered educational publishing in 1973 with its textbook Utah's Heritage and its educational publishing efforts provided financial stability during its early years. By the late 1990s, 30 percent of its revenue came from publishing textbooks. Company growth and expansion By the early 1980s, the company had grown to eight employees. As of the late 1990s, it was a considered a mid-sized publisher, received about 100 manuscript submissions each week, and brought about 60 new books to market each year. The book topics included cowboy humor, western boots, architectural history, and cookbooks. By the mid-2000s, the company offered such specialty cookbooks as 101 Things To Do with Meatballs and a cookbook on ramen noodles. The company was also involved in nature and wilderness books, and Smith served as president of the Utah chapter of the Sierra Club in the late 1980s. By the mid-1990s, the company had expanded into children's books. The company also published on Utah-specific topics, like Utah folklore and LDS history. As major commercial publishing houses increasingly declined to publish manuscripts in the 1970s and 1980s that did not appear to guarantee commercial success, authors sought out publishing houses like Gibbs Smith. Educational publishing By the 2010s, the company's Gibbs Smith Education unit had developed state-specific social studies textbooks and digital materials based on Common Core standards and state-specific standards. The company claimed that as of 2013, more than 30 states used the company's social studies materials. =Controversy= In early 2014, a parent in central Washington state drew media attention after criticizing a Gibbs Smith Washington state history textbook's summary of the Second Amendment. School district staff maintained that any harm from the characterization of the Second Amendment‚Äîas based on a right to use guns for hunting and other legal purposes‚Äîwas minimal, as the information on the federal Constitution was supplementary to the textbook's core focus on state history and civics and because the text was necessarily diluted because of its mixed audience of seventh through ninth grade students.

DSSAT is built with a modular approach, with different options available to represent such processes as evapotranspiration and soil organic matter accumulation, which facilitates testing different representations of processes important in crop growth. The functionality of DSSAT has also been extended through interfaces with other software such as GIS. DSSAT typically requires input parameters related to soil condition, weather, any management practices such as fertilizer use and irrigation, and characteristics of the crop variety being grown. Many common crops have their characteristics already implemented as DSSAT modules. DSSAT grew out of the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnological Transfer (IBSNAT) in the 1980s, with the first official release in 1989. Version 4, released in 2003, introduced a more modular structure and added tools for agricultural economic analysis and risk assessment.

Although overwhelmed with sadness after losing his father (Kanji Tsuda), Masashi acts cheerful for the sake of his mother. As he goes about carrying boxes into their new apartment, Masashi feels a mysterious presence in the room. The next day, upon returning home from visiting the new elementary school, Masashi encounters a strange creature that looks like a jellyfish. Masashi names the adorable creature, which loves chee-kama (cheese-and-fish-cake sticks) and freely flies around, Kurage-bo (Jellyfish Boy). Despite the lack of a common language, they take to each other immediately and become friends. Masashi goes to school with Kurage- bo hidden in his backpack. He is anxious that someone might find out his secret, but then is astonished to discover that everyone in his new class has one of these strange creatures, which they call F.R.I.E.N.D.s, as his or her companion. The minute the teacher turns her back to the classroom, the children take out their controllers, called Devices, with which they generate and manipulate their F.R.I.E.N.D.s. Tatsuya's F.R.I.E.N.D. Yupi challenges Masashi, but Kurage-bo comes to his rescue and beats Yupi in combat with impeccable kung-fu skill. Masashi comes home to find his uncle, Naoto (Takumi Saitoh), who works at the local research center, arguing with his mother at the door. \\"This town is dangerous,\\" Naoto appeals to Yasuko. She retorts with anger, \\"You want us out of here?\\" Later, Naoto makes Masashi promise to report to him if he notices anything strange. Although Naoto takes note of Kurage-bo in Masashi's backpack, he doesn't bring it up. One day on his way home from school, Masashi comes across his classmates playing on the grounds of a shrine, making their F.R.I.E.N.D.s fight one another. The boys try to force Masashi to join the battle, but Kurage-bo is nowhere to be seen and the F.R.I.E.N.D.s are upon him. At the crucial moment, enormous and powerful Luxor appears together with Kurage-bo and they fight the F.R.I.E.N.D.s off. Luxor, Masashi finds out, is his classmate Saki (Himeka Asami)'s F.R.I.E.N.D. Saki reveals to Masashi that her Device was given to her, at a time when she was feeling down about family problems, by the top-level members of the research center. Cloaked in black, the four told her that the Device would give her \\"a friend who will never betray.\\" They gave out Devices to all the elementary school students in town. Soon the children started pitting F.R.I.E.N.D.s against F.R.I.E.N.D.s in battle, and now these battles take place all over. Meanwhile, a school festival is going on at the University, where Naoto's research center is located. The cult group to which Saki's mother, Shizuko (Asuka Kurosawa), belongs claims that the research going on at the University is evil and dangerous. They have organized a protest. When Shizuko presses Saki to pray with her, Masashi and Saki run away hand-in-hand and end up stepping into the midst of the research center. The Black-Cloaked Four, seeing the powerful energy in Masashi, start plotting to trap him in their hands. Having shared their problems with one another, Masashi and Saki start to develop a bond. But Tatsuya and Juran, who have found out that Naoto works for the research center, conspire against Masashi and kidnap Kurage-bo. When the gym teacher saw this, she punish Tatsuya and the group for hurting Masashi and Saki getting bumped in the head. While visiting Masashi, who is injured by Yupi and hospitalized, Naoto gives him a Device \\"as protection,\\" but something seems amiss. Later Masashi's mom tells him that Naoto fell of the building and died. At the forest Masashi looked for Kurage-bo but he was not seen. Saki came along and finds him and she and Masashi head to the lab.At the Lab Tatsuya and Juran meets the Cloak Four to challenge Koh, a boy who lives in the Orphanage. Koh uses a Anime girl named Ko2 and battled Yupi and Shimon and managed to defeat both of them. As she was about to finish them off until Masashi saves them. Masashi was then being choke by a F.R.I.E.N.D naoto before Kurage-bo saves him. Tatsuya and Juran tells Koh that he doesn't have to be alone.

Hatsune Miku, from the compilation album Re:Dial (TOY'S FACTORY).  Release  The film had its world premiere in Los Angeles. = Critical response = Jellyfish Eyes garnered generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, with common criticisms going towards its derivative nature and underwhelming story. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 25% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes based on twelve reviews, indicating that only three of those reviews were positive, while on Metacritic it garnered a weighted mean of 34 out of 100 based on five reviews. A reviewer for The New York Times dismissed the movie's camera work, \\"tedious\\" audio such as the overuse of screaming and the overly-bright score, incompetent special effects and inconsistent pacing. On the other hand, Chuck Bowen at Slant Magazine gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars, saying, \\"the filmmaker's distinct achievement resides in his blending of the cynical and wondrous. Jellyfish Eyes has an exhilaratingly na√Øve ending in which the playthings are cleansed of their impure origins and restored to the children as pure articles of the latter's creative process. It's an ending that smacks of protest via contrast, as Murakami is clearly asking: Why must we live in a world in which this idealism is na√Øve?\\" = Release history = Jellyfish Eyes was released on Blu-ray in Japan by Toho on January 24, 2014. On June 24, 2015, American art house distributor Janus Films acquired the rights to distribute Jellyfish Eyes in North America, which was then released on July 15, 2015.

It existed from 1911 until 1933, when it was disbanded by the National Socialists. History Scouting in Germany started in 1909. The Deutscher Pfadfinderbund was founded on 18 January 1911 in Berlin, becoming the first Scouting union in Germany. Being the first-and, at least in the beginning, the only-of its kind in Germany, the Pfadfinderbund quickly gained around 90,000 members. Under the direction of consul Georg Baschwitz, the first Scoutmaster (in German: Reichsfeldmeister or Bundesf√ºhrer, literally field-leader of the realm, or union-leader) was military person and Scouting pioneer Maximilian Bayer. The military background of Bayer was reflected in the military orientation the Pfadfinderbund had in the beginning. After World War I With the end of World War I, the Scouting movement in Germany strove to reintroduce a general structure, and reorganized the Pfadfinderbund in 1918. The first years of the newly formed Bund were marked by a recurring conflict about the orientation, between the \\"old\\" members that were active before World War I, and the \\"new\\" ones. While the old leading members almost all served in the German military during the war and wanted to rebuild the Pfadfinderbund in its old form, the new, progressive powers leaned more towards the Wandervogel as being more back-to-nature orientated and less nationalistic. This two main factions were the \\"jungdeutschen\\" (young German) and the \\"neudeutschen\\" (new German) Scouts. The latter adopted the so-called Prunner Gel√∂bnis (Vow of Prunn) in 1919, which became the German Scouts' epigraph. The first \\"Reichsfeldmeister\\" (fieldleader of the realm) after the war was Carl Freiherr von Seckendorff, chosen in Eisenach in 1919. While von Seckendorff was of the old leadership generation, both Scouting factions remained in the union. Secessions Former DPB quarters in Detmold Franz Ludwig Habbel's The World Scout Movement special edition of the official magazine of the Bund Deutscher Neupfadfinder This soon changed in 1920, when two leaders of the Neupfadfinder (New Scouts) faction, Martin Voelkel and Ludwig Habbel, were ejected from the Bund. Both \\"Jungdeutsche\\" and \\"Neudeutsche\\" formed their own Scouting organization after that, the \\"Bund Deutscher Neupfadfinder (BDN)\\" (Union of German new Scouts), in 1921. More factions, already existing and recently formed ones within the Pfadfinderbund, seceded soon after. The Neupfadfinder's renunciation followed the \\"Ringgemeinschaft\\" (Ring community), a moderate renewal movement, that founded the \\"Bund deutscher Ringpfadfinder\\" (Union of German Ring-Scouts) in 1922. Von Senckendorff himself left the Bund in 1923 to found the \\"Deutsche Pfadfinderschaft\\" (German Scouting movement). The short-lived, Eberhard Koebel-lead \\"Deutsche Jungenschaft vom 1. November 1929 (dj 1.11.)\\" (German young society of 1 November 1929), itself included as recently as 1931, left the Bund the same year, and more secessions followed up to 1933. Before the dissolution Meanwhile, life for the Deutscher Pfadfinderbund went on. Still being one of the largest organizations of its kind in Germany, despite the numerous renunciations, the Bund went on to develop itself further. They adopted the Scouting-typical clothing consisting of green shirt and scarf in 1922, and in 1928 they formed an international office communally with the \\"Bund deutscher Reichspfadfinder\\" (Union of Empire Scouts) and the \\"Kolonialpfadfindern\\" (Colonial Scouts). This international Scouting office later became the \\"Deutscher Pfadfinderverband\\" (German Scouting Federation), and joined the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1929. In 1933, the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder finally dissolved when all their members had to join the Hitler Youth.

Once widespread, the belief is now obsolete, having been superseded by more scientific rationales. It was supposed that the disease was caused by small worms resident within the tooth, eating it away. History The origins of the belief are wrapped in obscurity. A prominent early mention, a Babylonian cuneiform tablet titled \\"The Legend of the Worm\\" (sometimes erroneously dated to Sumerian times), recounts how the tooth worm drinks the blood and eats the roots of the teeth ‚Äì causing caries and periodontitis: > \\"After Anu [had created heaven], > Heaven had created [the earth], > The earth had created the rivers, > The rivers had created the canals, > The canals had created the marsh, > (And) the marsh had created the worm‚Äî > The worm went, weeping, before Shamash, his tears flowing before Ea: \\"What > wilt thou give for my food? What wilt thou give me for my sucking?\\" > \\"I shall give thee the ripe fig, (and) the apricot.\\" > \\"Of what use are they to me, the ripe fig and the apricot? Lift me up and > among the teeth and the gums cause me to dwell! The blood of the tooth I > will suck, and of the gum I will gnaw its roots!\\" Accounts are also found in the Central American legends of Popol Vuh. The belief persisted into the 18th century, only being disproven by the microscopical endeavors of M. Pierre Fauchard. Modern veterinary practice shows that when removed intact, the necrotic or partially necrotic tooth pulp can have an appearance like that of a worm. Sinhalese Charm for toothache: > Ira deyen√© asyƒÅ! > Sanda deyen√© aeyƒÅ! > Pass√© Budun√© acyƒÅ! > Dat√© nositoo dat aeyƒÅ! > Worm of the sun-god! > Worm of the moon god! > Worm of the Pass√© Buddha! > Stay not in the tooth, tou tooth-worm!  Evidence  Although no rigorous evidence was ever found, some practitioners believed the pulpal tissue within the root of the tooth to be a worm. Most however admitted to have never encountered a worm in vivo, but nonetheless encouraged the belief among the general public. A 2009 study by the University of Maryland Baltimore using micro imaging revealed worm-like structures within a dissected molar. While not worms or caused by worms, these structures may have given rise to the tooth-worm belief. It is unclear what these structures are or what caused them.

The architectural style is at once Federal and Greek Revival. It was built in the Federal style, as evident from the facade and the interior. After Brownrigg died, it was purchased by Thomas Harris in 1841. In 1854, a Doric portico was added. It was then purchased by the Fontaines, followed by the Kinnebrews (who owned it from 1887 to 1965), and then by the Butlers, who purchased it in 1967 and restored it. Temple Heights was purchased by the Novotnys in 2016, and they continue to restore it. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 22, 1978.

Wesleyan Female College of Wilmington, Delaware: A College Before its Time?, American Educational History Journal, v. 35 No. 2, p. 221-232 (2008) History Reverend Solomon Prettyman founded the institution in 1837 as the Wesleyan Female Seminary, with the support of the Philadelphia and Baltimore Conferences of the Methodist Church. In 1841 the school was chartered under the name of \\"Wesleyan Female Collegiate Institute.\\" By 1842, it had 111 students and nine instructors. Some complained about the growing intellectual rigor of the school. For example, an 1847 editorial in The Delaware Gazette noted the many courses in academic subjects but \\"heard nothing of the class upon making bread, puddings, and pies ...\\" A literary magazine called The Female Student and Young Ladies Chronicle was published by the school from 1844 to 1849. In 1851, after a period of decline, the board of trustees took over control from Prettyman for the Methodist Episcopal Church. The school was renamed as the \\"Wesleyan Female College\\" in 1855.Prettyman, Edgar Cannon (2 October 1938). Of the First Fruits of Methodism, Sunday Morning StarSimpson, Matthew (ed.) Cyclopaedia of Methodism, p. 956 (5th Rev. ed. 1883) Enrollment started to decline during the 1870s, probably due in part to the opening of the Wilmington Conference Academy, a secondary school which went co- educational in 1874. By 1879, enrollment had dropped to 66 students. A smallpox outbreak also decreased enrollment in 1880. Between 1855 and 1881, the school had 228 graduates. In 1882 the college was sold at a sheriff's sale to William Bright, who renamed it Wesleyan College and operated it on a non- sectarian basis.

In the French Third Republic he was convicted on a corruption charge. Early years No√´l Jacques Lefebvre was born on 19 February 1792 in Pont-Audemer, Eure, France. He was educated at the college of Pont-Audemer and then came to Paris to study law. He came to the attention of Charles-Guillaume √âtienne, who presented him to the Duke of Bassano, and he obtained a job at the Ministry of the State. He became a member of the Conseil d'Etat in 1814, but was dismissed with the restoration of the monarchy. Lefebvre became involved in the struggles of the Liberal party, was one of the founders of Le Nain jaune (The Yellow Dwarf) and contributed to the Mercure de France. In 1822 he married the daughter of M. Durufl√©, a wealthy manufacturer of cloth, and added his father-in-law's name to his own. They had nine children. He became a partner in the business, and introduced into its factories various manufacturing processes that had been used successfully in England and America. He left the business in 1847 to dedicate himself to politics. Political career During the July Monarchy Lefebvre tried several times to be elected as deputy, running for the Pont-Audemer constituency on a platform opposing King Louis Philippe. After the February Revolution of 1848 he again failed to be elected to the Constituent Assembly. He was able to gain appointment as the general counsel of the department of Eure. On 13 May 1849 he was elected deputy for the Eure in the legislative assembly, running as a conservative. In 1850 he help passed the bill to increase the salary of the President of the Republic, the future emperor Napoleon III. On 23 November 1851 Lefebvre was made Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.

Handfield was commissioned in Philipps' Regiment (the 40th Regiment of Foot) as an Ensign in 1720, taking up his duties at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1731 and received promotions to Lieutenant-Captain (1739), Captain (1740), Major (1754), and Lieutenant-Colonel (1758). Appointed to the Nova Scotia Council at Annapolis Royal in 1736 and granted the position of Justice of the Peace by Governor Peregrine Hopson in 1752. During Father Le Loutre's War, Captain Handfield was first in command of Fort Vieux Logis (1749); successfully defending the fort during the Siege of Grand Pre, while losing his son and future son-in-law Captain John Hamilton who were taken prisoner by the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias. In 1750 he was commander at Fort Anne, Annapolis Royal. He took command at Fort Lawrence where he married John Hamilton (British army officer) to his daughter (1752). Through his marriage to Acadian Elizabeth Winniet (sister of Joseph Winniett, both of whom were grandchildren of Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste), John was related to many Acadians and thus found carrying out his duties to deport the Acadians at Annapolis disagreeable. In a letter to John Winslow he states, \\"I heartily join with You in wishing that we were both of us got over this most disagreeable and troublesome part of the Service.\\" In 1758 he fought at the Siege of Louisbourg, retiring from His majesty's service in 1760.

Vaughan (ed.), The South, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004 , p. 58 His father, Phillips Fitzpatrick (1830‚Äì1901), was a physician, and his mother was Jane Lovedy Fitzpatrick (1850‚Äì1913). His paternal grandfather, Benjamin Fitzpatrick (1802‚Äì1869), served as the Governor of Alabama from 1841 to 1845. He attended the Stark University School in Montgomery and went to the University of Alabama to study journalism for two years, until he dropped out. He then spent a semester at the Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, but dropped out again. In 1918, he joined the United States Army and served in France during the First World War. In 1929, he spent a few months at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, France. In other words, his formal education was fairly limited, as he never managed to receive a degree from an institution of higher education. =Career= As a regionalist painter, Fitzpatrick is best known for his paintings of rural Alabama, especially his home county of Elmore County, Alabama.Joseph M. Flora, Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, The Companion to Southern Literature: Themes, Genres, Places, People, Movements, and Motifs, Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Louisiana State University Press, 2012 p. 68 He was inspired by French painters like Paul C√©zanne (1839‚Äì1906), Vincent van Gogh (1853‚Äì1890), and Henri Matisse (1869‚Äì1954). In the French tradition, he often painted out in the open, near lakes or creeks in the Alabama countryside. Together with a group of artists known as the Morningview Painters, Fitzpatrick founded the Alabama Art League in the late 1920s. This led to the establishment of the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Montgomery, Alabama in 1930. He sat on its original Board of Trustees and helped develop its permanent collection. Some of his work is still exhibited there. He also taught painting and served as director of the Montgomery Museum Art School.Ted Olson (ed.), CrossRoads: A Southern Culture Annual, Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 2004, p. 110 In 1938 and 1939, he was commissioned by the federal government as part of the Public Works of Art Project to produce paintings, including murals inside the newly constructed post offices in the towns of Ozark, Alabama titled Early Industry of Dale County and in Phenix City, Alabama titled Cotton.The Living New Deal In 1933, Fitzpatrick co-founded the Dixie Art Colony with Sallie B. Carmichael and her daughter Warree Carmichael LeBron.Joe Allen Turner, Jan Wood, Wetumpka, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2014, p. 116 The idea was to establish an artist colony to paint and train burgeoning artists in the South. From 1937, they met at Poka Hutchi (\\"gathering of picture writers\\" in Creek Indian parlance), a small cabin on Lake Jordan. Later, Frank W. Applebee, the Chair of the School of Art and Architecture at Auburn University and a painter, joined the colony, as did Genevieve Southerland, Anne Wilson Goldthwaite and Lamar Dodd (1909-1996).

At the 2006 census, its population was 55, in 52 families. Nakhlak Lead Complex has a history of 2500 years which is one of the oldest Underground mines in the country, and lies on the side-line of the Central Desert in Iran. The method of extraction in this mine is accumulative. Nakhlak, in recent years, has been able to produce more than its nominal capacity which is sent to the market. The amount of the sustainable Mineral is 30,000 tons annually which through processing, 3000 tons of concentrate is produced in a year. The establishment of a 6,000-ton processing plant, revival of Lead Mines in Anarak region, new exploration projects and the establishment of Iran Mining Museum are all in progress in the Complex. The Mine holds ISO14001, ISO9001 & OHSAS 18001 certificates. The Nakhlak mine, 55 kilometers northeast of Anarak is the largest and one of the most ancient lead ore deposits ever exploited in the Anarak region. Mining history, based on dated material from the mine adits and nearby historical ruins (e.g. the Qaleh- Bozorg fortress), was traced to the earliest stages of the Sassanid Empire (224-651 AD), and possibly even the latest stages of the Parthian Empire (247 BC-224 AD) (Hallier, 1972; St√∂llner and Weisgerber, 2004). The Gombad and Shaft no. 1 of the Nakhlak mine are nearby undated historical digging sites (which may reach 80 m depth), where smelters and mining tools (e.g. picks, hammers, wooden shoes, lamps, etc) are still preserved (Pernicka et al. 2011). Old reports on Iranian lead ores, including Nakhlak, can be found in the articles of Vaughan (1896) and Stahl (1897). More modern mining started in the mid-1930s, in co-operation with German and Austrian engineers and geologists like E. Fischer, E. Bohne, G. Ladame and M. Mazcek. The lead mineralization is situated mainly in the lower part of the Late Cretaceous carbonate rocks at Nakhlak, where sandstones and conglomerates are more common. Many characteristics of the ore deposit fit well with that of the typical Iranian MVT deposits (Rasa, 1987). The ore bodies occur within dolomites and dolomitized sandy limestones as steeply dipping quartz-calcite-barite veins or vein clusters of massive galena. Their thickness varies from 0.25 to 25 meters and extends up to 500 meters in length; it can be traced down along the dip to 400 meters deep (Romanko et al. 1984). Mining reserves have been estimated at ca. 7 million tons of lead (8.33%), zinc (0.38%) and a considerable amount of silver (72 g/t) (Cherepovsky, Chinakov and Kokorin, 1981). The lead greatly predominates over the zinc and silver contents, suggesting a basinal brine origin or fluid release model for the deposit (Rasa, 1987). The northern and southern flanks, as well as the deeper levels, offer potential supplementary mining possibilities, where even new ore bodies may be found. The primary ore seems to be monomineralic, consisting solely of galena. Cerussite in various forms is common in the oxidized zone.

The Royal Navy captured her in 1793, and purchased her in 1794. Because there was already a in service, the navy changed her name to Musquito. During her brief service Musquito captured an armed vessel that appears to have out-gunned her. Capture The Royal Navy captured Venus in the West Indies in 1793. Career Musquito was commissioned under the command of Lieutenant John Fenton. His replacement, in 1795, was Lieutenant John Boucher McFarlane. On 9 June 1795, Mosquito captured the French privateer sloop Rasoir national, after a seven-hour long engagement. The privateer was armed with six guns and had a crew of 40 men. Lieutenant M'Farlane was killed early during the action. The next day Mosquito recaptured the privateer's prize, a Spanish brig that had been sailing from Havana to Cartagena with a cargo of flour. Mosquito had sustained substantial damage in the engagement and her master was unable to proceed to Mole St. Nicholas, as per orders, but instead was able to reach Providence with both the privateer and the recaptured brig. On 24 February 1796, was patrolling near Cap-Fran√ßois looking for reinforcements expected from Cork when she encountered a French corvette. After a chase of ten hours, the frigate ran ashore in a cove to the east of Porto Plata, where her crew abandoned her, enabling the British to retrieve her. She turned out to be the Per√ßante, armed with twenty 9-pounder guns and six brass 2-pounders, with a crew of 200 men under the command of Citoyen Jacque Clement Tourtellet. She had left La Rochelle on 6 December 1795 under orders from the Minister of Marine and Colonies not to communicate with any vessel on the way. The British took her into service as the sixth-rate HMS Jamaica. Musquito must have been in company or in sight as she shared in the proceeds of the capture. In 1796 Lieutenant Mann, (act.), commanded Musquito on the Jamaica station. Fate In February 1799, Musquito was captured off Cuba by two Spanish Navy frigates.

Erzigkeit was chief editor of the newspaper until the end of 2013, during which time it renamed itself after an acquisition to the Ostth√ºringer Zeitung. Since 2010, the content of the OTZ has increasingly been integrated with its sister publications from the Mediengruppe Th√ºringen, the Th√ºringer Allgemeine (TA) and the Th√ºringische Landeszeitung. At the end of 2013, the printing center in L√∂bichau was closed, which laid off more than 100 employees. Since then, the OTZ has been partly printed in the printing house of the Zeitungsgruppe Th√ºringen in Erfurt and partly in Chemnitz.

The film chronicles the journey of (fictional) misguided market researcher John Wooley (played by Second City alum Brian Shortall) as he attempts to sell ISPs' vision for what they call a \\"faster, cleaner\\" Internet. However, learning about net neutrality from several (non-fictional) people in the process, he ultimately opts to re-consider his standpoint. Designed specifically to reach an audience not versed in technology or policy, The Internet Must Go has reached nearly a quarter of a million viewers and about 5,000 Facebook fans in its first 2 months online. The release of the short was made to coincide with the opening arguments in Verizon v. F.C.C. about Net Neutrality. Plot The docufiction short centers on John Wooley, a (fictional) market researcher who \\"has been dispatched to help the big Internet service providers sell their vision of a faster, cleaner Internet\\". He embarks on the journey, believing he's doing something great and important. Over the course of his journey he interviews several people (notably non- fictional people whose business depends on net neutrality), who one by one help him to understand why his mission is misguided. Then he ventures to North Carolina where he interacts with (non-fictional) people who, stifled by a lack of broadband altogether, have attempted to build community broadband. However, he finds that North Carolina now has barriers to building community broadband. While he interacts with those people, he ultimately has a change of heart, and decides to \\"leak\\" his research publicly to the internet, in favour of net neutrality.  Production = Cast = The movie stars Brian Shortall as (fictional) market researcher John Wooley, who interviews several people who happen to be open-internet advocates. These interviewees are, however, non- fictional people, who appear in the movie as themselves. Fictional cast * Brian Shortall as (fictional) market researcher John Wooley Non-fictional cast * Tim Wu (professor at Columbia Law School who coined net neutrality) as himself * Al Franken (junior United States Senator from Minnesota) as himself * Rashad Robinson (Executive Director of Color of Change) as himself * Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of the social news website reddit) as himself * Eli Pariser (co-founder of Avaaz.org and Upworthy) as himself * Farnum Brown (investment manager (at Trillium Invest Management, unnoted) and AT&T; shareholder) as himself * Gigi Sohn (of Public Knowledge) as herself * Harold Feld (of Public Knowledge) as himself * Robin Chase (founder and CEO of Buzzcar and former CEO of Zipcar) as herself * Ricken Patel (Executive Director of Avaaz) * Craig Aaron (President and CEO of Free Press (organization)), as himself * Susan Crawford (professor at the Cardozo School of Law and former ICANN Board Member), as herself * Larry Lessig (American academic best known as founding member of Creative Commons) as himself * Catharine Rice (broadband consultant with Action Audits, North Carolina) as herself * John Hodgman (American author, actor and humorist) as himself =Crew, Partners and Funding= The movie was fiscally sponsored by the non-for-profit Women Make Movies. Funders include The Ford Foundation, The Open Society Foundation, Media Democracy Fund, and Wyncote Foundation. As an independent short, the film's website lists contributors to the movie, in notable detail. This includes cast/the cameos, several kinds of producers, writers, funders, editors, consultants, advisors, production managers, animators, camera, legal counsel, post-production, voiceover, assistants, pod- editors, website, graphics design, campaign, press, associates, partners and others.

Its website, theinternetmustgo.com, then augments its functionality. Apart from featuring the movie, it provides information about the movie such us director's notice, creators, press, etc. This information also allows a watcher to verify the docufiction nature of the movie, which is not vocalized in the work itself. The site also features a section called \\"Take Action\\" providing activism support for net neutrality. It links to some of the non-fictional organization and people presented. =\\"Bonus leaks\\"= In a section named \\"Bonus leaks\\", the site features 13 extra videos made with the interviewees, as well as a list of real-world articles featured in the film (called \\"Wooley's Research\\"), and a map of US states \\"that have erected barriers to community broadband\\". Aftermath On January 6, 2014, about 4 months after the movie's release, American multinational telecommunications corporation AT&T; announced that they will be pushing \\"sponsored data\\" to companies, who would be allowed to pay for the bandwidth their customers use. This arguably undermines net neutrality, as noted by several associations connected to the movie, e.g. Fight for the Future, who also supports the prediction that other carriers will most likely try to follow and details some implications on individuals and on the open internet. In its article about the announcement, Wired noted that previously \\"By a 3‚Äì2 vote in 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules, which became effective a year later.\\" See also * Net neutrality * Data discrimination * Net bias * Wireless community network * Community informatics * Freedom of information * Free Culture movement * Brian Shortall * Women Make Movies ReferencesExternal links * The Internet Must Go Website * The movie on YouTube * Director's Note about the movie * Works by Gena Konstantinakos on her website Category:American docufiction films Category:English-language films Category:2013 films Category:American independent films Category:Internet documentary films Category:2013 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Short documentary films ","title":"The Internet Must Go"},{"id":"41634848","text":"Mario Luis Fuentes Alcal√° Mario Luis Fuentes Alcal√° (born 18 January 1956) is a Mexican politician and economist who served as Director-General of the Mexican Social Security Institute in 2000.

It was the twentieth edition of the Bluebonnet Bowl. Stanford overcame a 22‚Äì0 third quarter deficit and won the game, 25‚Äì22. Teams=Stanford= Stanford was making its second consecutive bowl appearance under second-year head coach Bill Walsh. Stanford was noted for its pass-heavy offense, led by Sammy Baugh Trophy-award winning quarterback Steve Dils and his targets, receiver Ken Margerum and back Darrin Nelson. =Georgia= A tie in their second-to-last game of the season kept Georgia out of a possible berth in the 1979 Sugar Bowl. Led by long-time coach Vince Dooley, the Bulldogs were ranked #11 and featured a punishing defense and a rushing attack led by SEC offensive player of the year Willie McClendon. The Bulldogs had lost their last three bowl games, dating back to the 1974 Tangerine Bowl. Game summary Georgia dominated the first half, scoring on two Carmon Prince touchdown receptions and a Rex Robinson field goal to lead 15‚Äì0 at the half. The only miscues were in the kicking game: Robinson missed the extra point on both touchdowns. Early in the third quarter, another Bulldog score on a one-yard run by quarterback Jeff Pyburn made the score 22‚Äì0, and it appeared that Georgia would complete a rout. But following that score, Stanford quarterback Steve Dils hit receiver Ken Margerum on a 32-yard touchdown pass. Stanford's attempt at a two-point conversion was no good, but on Georgia's ensuing possession, running back Willie McClendon fumbled on the Georgia 19. Two plays later, Dils connected with Darrin Nelson for a 20-yard touchdown pass. Stanford then completed a successful two-point conversion, in which kicker Ken Naber faked a kick attempt and then ran into the end zone to make the score 22‚Äì14. Georgia's next possession was three plays and a short punt which gave Stanford the ball at the Georgia 41. Three plays later, Dils hit Margerum again for a 14-yard touchdown pass, and connected with Nelson for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 22‚Äì22. The Bulldogs fumbled again (one of five on the day), setting up a Naber 27-yard field goal which gave Stanford a 25‚Äì22 lead early in the fourth quarter. Georgia's Robinson missed another field goal to tie the game and the Stanford defense did the rest to shut down the Bulldogs, led by linebacker Gordy Ceresino's 20 tackles. Ceresino was named the game's defensive MVP; offensive MVP was quarterback Dils, who completed 17 of 28 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns. =Scoring=First quarter *Georgia - Rex Robinson 31-yard field goal Second quarter *Georgia - Carmon Prince 22-yard pass from Buck Belue (Robinson kick failed) *Georgia - Prince 8-yard pass from Jeff Pyburn (Robinson kick failed) Third quarter *Georgia - Pyburn 1-yard run (Robinson kick) *Stanford - Ken Margerum 32-yard pass from Steve Dils (Dils pass failed) *Stanford - Darrin Nelson 20-yard pass from Dils (Ken Naber run) *Stanford - Margerum 14-yard pass from Dils (Dils pass to Nelson) Fourth quarter *Stanford - Naber 24-yard field goal Aftermath This was the last game of Bill Walsh's first coaching stint with Stanford; following this game, he became head coach of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, eventually leading them to three Super Bowl titles. Walsh returned to Stanford in 1992 and coached the Cardinal for three seasons and one bowl victory. Stanford's football program slid after Walsh's departure, and they would not return to a bowl for 8 years when they earned a berth in the 1986 Gator Bowl. Georgia did not make a bowl in the following season, but Dooley's 1980 team, quarterbacked by Buck Belue, who was a freshman in the Bluebonnet Bowl, was undefeated and named national champion by most media organizations.

The property occupies an area of , of which is described as being in good or fair condition. It has a carrying capacity of 10,500 sheep. The country is mostly alluvial plains with duplex soils and many sandy rises. The vegetation is mixed shrubland of currant bush, many acacias and some Gascoyne bluebush. The western portion of the station is made up of flat, saline alluvial plains that support salt bush, blue bush and taller acacia species. History Boologoroo was established in 1894 by Robert Campbell. Campbell had previously taken up Beringarra Station in 1881 before acquiring Boologooroo. By 1906 the property was owned by Harry Campbell. Robert Campbell died of heart failure in 1909 with Harry taking full ownership of Boologooroo. A thunderstorm struck the station in 1911, and the windmill near the homestead was destroyed by the winds. of rain fell in just over an hour and the temperature dropped from to in forty minutes. In 1923 the area was struck by a cyclone, with Boologooroo receiving over a few days. The area of the property in 1924 was and had a flock of 23,000 sheep in 1925. The body of Jack Smith was found in the woolshed in an advanced state of decomposition in 1932. Smith had enquired about work of the station but then committed suicide in the shed. In 2018 Boologooroo was sold to Gordon Cattle Company.

They were built for New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) the final development of the six-coupled tank engine in New Zealand, the penultimate class of tank locomotives to be built for NZR, and the first class of tank locomotives to be built with superheaters. Introduction The WW class were based on the earlier WG class 4-6-4T tank locomotives, but with a reduced boiler pressure of 180psi and larger cylinders. The initial batch comprising locomotives WW 556-575 were built at Hillside Workshops in 1913, and initially carried the WG classification before being reclassified as the WW class, the 'W' indicating that these locomotives were intended for suburban work in Wellington. Following the success of the first twenty locomotives, Hillside delivered a further thirty locomotives which were classified WW from new. A further fourteen locomotives were rebuilt from the WG class at Hutt Workshops in two batches between 1940‚Äì42 and 1950-52. Although most of the class were built with piston valves, WW 565 was delivered with slide valves, which were not suited to superheated steam, leading to their replacement with standard piston valves. In service The WW class proved to be extremely versatile in service, being capable of handling almost any task. Initially both Auckland and Wellington received allocations of these locomotives which were used in suburban passenger service and occasionally on goods work; later allocations saw engines of this class allocated to the West Coast at Westport and Greymouth. Here, the locomotives worked mostly on coal trains and occasionally hauled branch line passenger services. During the early 1950s, the decision was made to fit new higher- pitched boilers with deeper fireboxes to four WG class locomotives, Nos. 479, 480, 486 and 488, as a trial when they were rebuilt to WW class specifications. This required a new type of smokebox saddle, cab and enlarged coal bunker. This alteration was deemed to be successful, adding an extra 100 sq. ft. of heating surface; rather than rebuild the remaining six WGs due to the poor condition of their frames, NZR decided to rebuild twelve existing WW class locomotives, Nos. 571, 573-575, 644, 669, 672, 678-680, 683-684. During the early 1960s, several of the WW class locomotives transferred from the North Island to Greymouth were altered to operate on the Rewanui Incline by the provision of 'trap-door' cowcatchers to clear the centre rail and additional air reservoirs on the tops of the side tanks. Following the removal of the centre rail in 1966, the locomotives' extra reservoirs were removed and the original brake pump was replaced by two larger pumps, one on each side of the smokebox. Withdrawal The first member of the WW class to be withdrawn was WW 491, which was withdrawn in August 1955 for use as a sectionalised aid for apprentice training at Otahuhu Workshops. A further forty-three locomotives were withdrawn by the first half of the 1960s, by which time the remaining twenty-one locomotives were in service in Auckland and on the West Coast. Further withdrawals were at a slower pace, with a final seven locomotives still in service on the West Coast at the start of 1969. Preservation Four WW class locomotives have been preserved, all in the North Island. Three were rebuilt with higher-pitched boilers while the fourth retains its original low-pitched boiler: * WW 480/GVR No.1 (Hillside 104 of 1910) was originally built as a WG class locomotive in 1910 and was rebuilt as a WW class locomotive with larger cylinders and a higher-pitched boiler in 1951. Withdrawn in June 1969, the locomotive was purchased by the Railway Enthusiasts Society for use on their Glenbrook Vintage Railway and ran from Greymouth to Auckland under its own steam. After being overhauled the locomotive was renumbered to GVR NO 1 and had its original identity restored in 2002. WW 480 was withdrawn from service in 2010 and was overhauled at the GVR's Pukeoware workshops, returning to service in March 2013. The locomotive was later withdrawn from service in May 2013 for a boiler overhaul. It is currently nearing the end of the overhaul which includes a brand new boiler. * WW 491 (Hillside 116 of 1912) was originally built as a WG class locomotive in 1910 and was rebuilt as a WW class locomotive in 1941. Withdrawn in 1955, the locomotive was moved to the Otahuhu Workshops where it was sectionalised as an aid for apprentice training. The remains of WW 491 were donated to MOTAT in 1975, where it remains on static display although its restoration has been stated as a long-term objective. WW 491 is the only member of its class preserved to retain its original low-pitched boiler. * WW 571 (Hillside 147 of 1914) was built as a WW class locomotive in 1914, and rebuilt with a higher- pitched boiler in July 1956 before it was transferred from Wellington to Westport. Retired from Greymouth in 1969, WW 571 was sold to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society Wellington Branch for preservation and ran to Wellington under its own steam later that year. WW 571 is now based on the Silver Stream Railway and is stored pending overhaul. * WW 644/GVR No.2 (Hillside 179 of 1915) was built as a WW class locomotive in 1915, and rebuilt with a higher-pitched boiler in July 1953. Withdrawn by NZR at Greymouth in 1969, the locomotive was sold to the Railway Enthusiasts Society in 1970 and ran to Auckland under its own steam. Dismantled for overhaul, WW 644 was renumbered as GVR NO 2\\\\. The locomotive was stored in a dismantled state until 2002 when its overhaul was restarted and was restored to working order in 2007 as WW 644. In addition, Steam Incorporated also owned an original low-pitched WW boiler which had originally been fitted to WW 646\\\\. This boiler was purchased from industrial use at the Ford Motor Company plant in the Hutt Valley in the 1970s and was stored at Paekakariki until early 2015 when it was sold to MOTAT to aid the future restoration of WW 491\\\\.

Built by the Hunslet Engine Company for the Public Works Department in 1923, all three were sold to NZR between 1938 and 1945. In service The three Y class locomotives were sold by the PWD to NZR in two batches, NO 543 being purchased in October 1938 and NOs 542 and 544 in August 1945. Originally they were allocated to the Way and Works Branch for construction work but later saw some use by the Mechanical Branch as shunting engines for hire to private industries whose own engines were under repair. The three engines were transferred to the Mechanical Branch in 1951 and received the class letter 'Y' in 1952. During their service life with the NZR, the locomotives retained their original PWD numbers. In 1949, NO 544 was loaned to the Whakatane Board Mills for use on their Matahina Tramway while their two ex-NZR FA class locomotives were overhauled. This was the most notable use of one of these engines while on loan from NZR to private industry. While in NZR service, the Y class locomotives tended to be based out of the Auckland locomotive depot and were used for shunting purposes there. Withdrawal As a splinter class with very little useful capabilities on a modern railway, the Y class were relatively quickly withdrawn. Y 544 was noted at Wanganui in 1956 behind the locomotive depot with a worn-out boiler, before being finally written off on 17 August 1957. Y 543 remained in service as a working locomotive until withdrawn on 1 February 1958, but remained in semi-storage until sold to Pacific Steel at Otahuhu in early 1964 for scrap. Y 542 was withdrawn in working order on 17 August 1957 but was then sold to Wilsons (NZ) Portland Cement for use on their private railway at Portland, south of Whangarei. Industrial service Aside from the locomotives' service to the Public Works Department, Y 542 was sold in 1957 to Wilsons (NZ) Portland Cement for use on their private railway between the cement factory near Portland station on the North Auckland Line and the company's quarries. Painted in the standard Wilsons livery of blue with red trim, 542 became the second Wilsons NO 3 in place of an earlier ex-NZR locomotive, D 171, which was scrapped in 1957. 542 continued in industrial service until 1985, by which time it was held in store as a reserve for the company's fleet of Bagnall and Drewry diesel shunting locomotives. Preservation Y 542 (Hunslet 1444 of 1923) was sold to Wilsons Portland Cement in 1957 and was used on their internal railway network until 1985, by which time it was kept in reserve. The locomotive was purchased by MOTAT in 1985 and was restored to working order as Y 542.

Despite never having worked in the mining industry he was elected Secretary of the Nchanga branch of the African Mineworkers' Union (AMWU). Mwendapole was more militant than the President of the union, Lawrence Katilungu, and was prominent in the internal union opposition to his leadership. In 1954 Mwendapole led the Nchanga miners out on strike in sympathy with the African General Workers' Union, in defiance of direct instructions from Katilungu not to stop work. In 1956, following an extended period of strikes, the Northern Rhodesian government declared a State of Emergency on the Copperbelt and immediately arrested a large number of AMWU leaders, including Mwendapole. Following his release from detention Mwendapole was re-employed by the union as head office clerk, but was barred from visiting any of the mine townships by the mining companies.

Running career=High school= Moran moved to the Lawrenceville section of Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey at the age of 6 and attended Notre Dame High School, where he didn't take up running until his sophomore year. By his senior year of high school, Moran's personal bests were 4:19 (min:sec) in the mile and 9:26 for the 2-mile.Hunt, Christopher. \\"Moran to live dream in NYC marathon\\", ESPN New York, November 2, 2011.

In spite of being in a track team of prodigies like Sean Graham, Moran eventually became a standout in the 5000 metres. His collegiate career was riddled with serious injuries, and due to this it was not until his sixth year (after being granted extended eligibility by the NCAA) of studying while earning a master's degree that he exploded in the 5000 metres. =Post-collegiate= Moran was very close to deciding not to continue running after college. By the time he finished his undergrad studies in 2003, he was working on completing a master's degree in public policy and tried to focus on a career after college. He changed his mind after the 2005 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where he ran 13:25.87 (min:sec) in the 5000 metres, 14 seconds better than his previous personal best. He subsequently signed a professional contract with Nike so that he could train full-time. In 2007, Moran won the men's 5000 metres at the 2007 Pan American Games, and as of 2014 still holds the course record of the race. He was selected to run for the US at the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships although he did not finish the race. Moran ran the same competition the following year, finishing the course at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 60th place of 137 finishers.

The neighborhood is located on the side of Poppy Peak, a mountain of the San Rafael Hills. Developer William Carr platted the neighborhood in 1924. The homes in the district were designed by a number of significant Modern Movement architects. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description The Poppy Peak District is located in the southwestern corner of Pasadena and borders the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Eagle Rock and Highland Park. The district is roughly enclosed by La Loma Road to the north, Avenue 64 to the east, Poppy Peak Drive to the south, and the Pasadena city limits to the west. The four main streets through the district are Poppy Peak Drive, Kaweah Drive, Pleasant Way, and Cresthaven Drive. The district is accessed via Poppy Peak Drive, which intersects La Loma Road at the foot of the mountain and connects the other three streets. The streets are steep, narrow, and winding; as a result, the neighborhood has no sidewalks and few front lawns. The district includes 45 residential properties. 30 of these are Modernist homes which are considered contributing to the district's historical significance, while the remainder are either newer buildings, empty lots, or representative of other styles. History Poppy Peak was named by early settlers for the California poppies which grew on the mountainside. The Tongva people lived on and near the mountain prior to late 18th century Spanish colonization in the region. After the Mexican Rancho La Ca√±ada displaced the tribe, no residential development took place on the mountain until the 20th century. In 1924, developer William Carr purchased the mountain and platted it into residential lots; Carr himself built a house at 1516 Poppy Peak Drive. The first Modernist homes in the district were built in the 1930s; the majority were built in the 1940s and 1950s, while the latest contributing house was constructed in 1968. As of 2008, only two homes have been added to the district since the 1960s. 1626 and 1630 Poppy Peak Drive, the latter a contributing property to the historic district Architecture The thirty Modern Movement houses in the district were designed by a variety of prominent architects. Richard Neutra designed the house at 1540 Poppy Peak Drive, a post and beam house which features a characteristic \\"spider leg\\" beam extending past its south side. Two 1930s designs by Harwell Hamilton Harris are located at 1642 Pleasant Way and 1444 Poppy Peak Drive; the latter house was moved to the district in 1951 by architect Leland Evison. Several architects associated with the University of Southern California School of Architecture designed houses in the district, including James Pulliam, the three partners of Buff, Straub and Hensman, Lyman Ennis, Kenneth Nishimoto, and the aforementioned Leland Evison.

He asks if their daughter can help and they say she is dead. The Judge doesn't believe she is dead and takes the case, hoping to Judge Hardy enlists the help of his son, Andy (Mickey Rooney), to find the couple‚Äôs daughter. Andy is having his own problems. He needs new tires and has no money. Beezy takes his last money as repayment of a debt. He tries to borrow money from his sister, Marian, who gives him three dollars. While he tries to buy new tires, Polly Benedict finds him and asks him to buy tickets to the dance. The tickets are more expensive than he thought, leaving him not enough money for new tires. On a ride to the courthouse, he continues to try to patch the old. He tries to get money from the Judge, but he is so overdrawn on his allowance this isn't possible. The Judge agrees that if Andy helps him find his client's daughter, he will get paid. Andy's tires pop again as his dad exits the car. Andy gets to work. Taking a break at Polly's house, she wants to get romantic. All Andy wants to do is sit and have a cold drink after visiting 14 houses in the heat- all on foot. Eventually, they go for a walk and end up at E.V. Horton's home. Polly calls her stuck up because she uses her initials and is a freshman. Andy dumps Polly on a hunch that E.V. Horton is who he might be looking for. He enters the property and finds E.V. by the pool. She is a well- developed girl, who looks older than a freshman. They chat and have a soda at her own soda fountain. Andy finds out her name is Elvie and that she is writing an essay on Alexander Hamilton, which could net her a $50 prize. Her mother comes in and asks why they aren't playing. Elvie says, \\"We were digesting our sodas.\\" Her mother is concerned about Andy's age. He confesses he is over 14 (whereas she is actually 18) and leaves. Andy runs to the tire store and takes his new tires on credit- as he does on his new suit. The ladies in the family are planning a trip to Canada to see Mrs. Hardy's family, but the Judge must remain at home and work. Andy stays to work for his father. Marian is going to lake for vacation. The Judge and Andy work and return home to find Mrs. Hardy, who didn't think they could fend for themselves. She doesn't feel well so she goes to bed. Mrs. Hardy (Fay Holden) contracts pleurisy and is in an oxygen tent. In the meantime, Andy begins an essay on Alexander Hamilton, but finds it is only for girls. He visits several girls trying to con them into using his and giving him the $50 and they keep the glory and a 20 volume set of historical biographies. Because of his conning, Andy gets stuck with too many girls bothering him while he is trying to solve the case. Including several who think he is taking them to the dance. Mrs. Hardy gets worse and Andy drives to get Marian. They get stuck on the opposite side of a bridge in danger of washing out. They walk with a cop to the other side and he gives them his car to get home. Their mother makes it through the crisis and gets better. The next day, Andy visits the girls and finds that they didn't use his essay and are wildly inappropriate. He visits Elvie and finds her crying and tries to help her. She says she hates her mother. Andy is shocked but then Elvie says she didn't mean it. He asks if she could talk to her father and she says the man is her step father. She said she can't even write her essay. Once she is calmed he asks about Elvie using his essay. She asks why he was asking about her name. He said it is because of his father. She said that her real name is Elnora Valduzzi Brock. He takes off to go home and hits a pot hole, losing his tires and bumper. The Judge comes to pick him up. Andy tells him the story and the Judge takes off to talk to Elnora's mother. He tells Mrs. Horton that the Valduzzi's need money and he was hoping to find children- and children can be compelled to take care of parents. She wants to give him a check. He tells her about her own daughter. Elnora comes in and wonders why her mother is crying but is sent upstairs. Mrs. Horton said she will confess to her husband and help her parents. Paret of the problem is that she told her husband she was younger than she is and her parents were dead. She says her daughter can stop living her lie today. With two dates, Andy talks to his father. He wants to go with Polly and not with the other girl. He sees no way out and he is in debt. The Judge agrees to take care of his debts except the car until it gets fixed. He tells Andy they will have to take a bus to the fireworks and dance. Later that day, Polly comes by, angry that Andy has two dates. She said she told the other girl to back off. Meanwhile Elnora comes to the door looking her age. She thanks him and gives him the $50. Later Polly and Andy show off to Mrs. Hardy before the dance. They go in Elnora's car.

It was designed by Aaron Bolot and built in 1937 by C. & B. J. Williams. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The architect, Aaron Bolot, is known for his classic art deco buildings throughout Sydney, such as his commissions for grand apartment buildings in Potts Point. History=Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru- ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003 By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =The Ritz Theatre= Part of the Art Deco interior at The Ritz Aaron Bolot was born in 1900 in Crimea. To escape persecution against Jewish people, Bolot migrated to Brisbane in 1911. Bolot enrolled at Brisbane's Central Technical College to study architecture and graduated in 1926. Upon graduation he was awarded the Queensland Institute of Architects Gold medal. Following graduation Bolot worked for Hollinshed and Gailey and whilst there assisted on two notable theatre projects, the Melbourne Comedy and Brisbane Regent. In 1930 Bolot moved to Sydney and set up his own practice. He completed several building projects during the decade ranging from houses and multi-storeyed apartments buildings to incinerators and theatres. During this time Bolot worked with Walter Burley Griffin. Bolot produced drawings for Griffin for two incinerators, one located at Pyrmont and the other at Willoughby. Bolot designed two theatres, the Hoyts Theatre at Goulburn described at that time as \\"an outstanding example of its genre\\" and the Astra at Wyong. In 1937 Bolot designed the Randwick Ritz for his clients Randwick Estate Ltd. At the same time he also designed the Regal Theatre at Gosford. In 1938 Bolot designed Ashdown located at 96 Eilzabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay. Consisting of thirty-six apartments it is regarded as an outstanding building of interwar functionalist style. Later in 1938 Bolot remodelled the Melba Theatre in Melbourne which was renamed the New Liberty Theatre. In 1941 he remodelled West's Nowra Theatre. In 1942 Bolot joined the army and served as a Warrant Officer in Egypt and New Guinea. After the war Bolot resumed work as an architect and in 1948 designed the landmark apartment building located at 17 Wylde Street, Potts Point. Designed in 1948 and completed in late 1951 due to shortages in building materials, it was one of the largest buildings of any type to be constructed in the inner city area following the Second World War. In 1965 Bolot married and lived with his wife in Gommerah an apartment block located at Darling Point designed by him in 1957. In 1989 Bolot died leaving a legacy of innovative architecture.Veale, 1995:5-7 Since its construction, the cinema has been owned by, among others, the Hoyts cinema group and the Brigidine Sisters (an order of nuns running the adjacent Brigidine College). In the late 1980s the current owners planned to demolish the existing cinema and to redevelop the site.. However, Randwick City Council and the then Minister for Planning intervened and a Permanent Conservation Order was imposed on the Ritz building in March, 1993. The current owners refurbished the building in the late 1990s, adding additional cinemas to the original single principal cinema theatre in order to allow the Ritz to survive in the era of competition with larger multiplex cinema chains. Description The Ritz Theatre is constructed of brick with a galvanised iron roof supported on angle steel trusses. It has seating capacity of about 900. The Randwick Ritz was built on two levels in the Inter-war Art Deco linear geometric style. The rendered facade reflects the early skyscraper style concept with a strong vertical emphasis expressed by vertical linear ribbing and reeding, as well as the stepped parapet. This feeling of strong verticality was even further emphasised by the deliberate stepping of the street awning over the entrance foyer doors. The awning itself retains its original pressed metal soffit, or underside lining, which is wholly decorated with characteristic geometric Art Deco motifs in a regular repeated pattern. The Art Deco linear geometric style is relieved internally by curved walls to the main stair, half landing and curved corners in the foyer and first floor lounge. The auditorium is distinctive through its Art Deco lights in two panels of nine wall lights to either side of the screen and the continuous ground glass box lighting with its chevron motif. The plaster decoration to the walls and ceiling is in geometric patterns in low relief with extensive use of grills and reveals. The detailing to the gilded plaster speaker boxes, which flank the main screen is particularly fine.Commission of Enquiry 1985:10,18 =Australian Film Walk of Fame= One of the plaques in the Australian Film Walk of Fame outside The Ritz In 2008, the Australian Film Walk of Fame was created outside the Ritz, with plaques honouring members of the Australian film industry. The walk was initiated by Randwick Council, with support from the Coogee Arts Festival and The Ritz. =Condition= As at 1 October 1997, the physical condition is good. Archaeological potential is low. =Modifications and dates= Built in 1937. Alterations made about 1954 to accommodate a wide screen. Interior redecorated around 1963.  Heritage listing  The Randwick Ritz is a good example of a picture theatre showing the smaller scaling and reduced decoration often applied to suburban theatres. It is one of the few surviving examples of the hundreds of cinema which were built during the 1930s, the most creative period of cinematic design in Australia It has many fine pieces of Art Deco decoration in a restrained Art Deco setting. The Ritz Theatre is a record of the cinema culture of the 1930s. The building has an excellent ability to interpret aspirations, uses, tastes and importance of cinema in the society of the 1930s It is the last known surviving theatre by A.M. Bolot. Following demolition or alteration of most suburban picture theatres, it is now an important and rare survival. Ritz Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Ritz Theatre is one of the few surviving examples of the hundreds of cinema which were built during the 1930s, the most creative period of cinematic design in Australia.Jean, A., 1995:12 It is an excellent example of the later expressionist style of cinemas showing the evolution of the theatre from the picture palaces of the 1920s, the French inspired art deco designs of early 1930s to the German influenced expressionist futuristic cinemas of the late 1930s. It is an example of cinema design and philosophy reflecting the influences of the German dominated cinematic world of the 1920s rather than American Hollywood which has had a mjor and overpoering impact on the world for the past 50 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.
